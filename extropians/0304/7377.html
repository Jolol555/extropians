</em><br>
<p>I guess the website that I am part of would have to be one of those
<br>
websites!
<br>
It is <a href="http://www.universaltransparency.org">http://www.universaltransparency.org</a>
<br>
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<p>Now, I have obviously given this great thought, and I think that there is
<br>
probably some midway point that would work. For example, one of many
<br>
possible implementations would be a society where there was great Universal
<br>
Transparency wherever there are advanced technologies like nano or biotech
<br>
or even some easier techs. But from there, we could have refuges where
<br>
privacy was respected to different levels. For example, a commons where
<br>
everyone enters and is checked at the door, like nightclubs today where they
<br>
have metal detectors. Inside this common area, most anything goes, the laws
<br>
are liberal, and there are places where there are no cameras. Perhaps we
<br>
would live in apartments that have a private room that we can take nothing
<br>
into that could be weaponized.
<br>
<p>As often is the case, both sides will probably need to compromise. Privacy
<br>
advocates have to realize that privacy can be abused, transparency advocates
<br>
and the general public (like 80% of Americans, who have &quot;nothing to hide&quot; )
<br>
have to appreciate that privacy is not just used to hide illegal things.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think that if laws were rewritten to decriminalize and
<br>
destigmatize sex, drugs, gambling and other personal choice issues, then
<br>
transparency would be much easier to implement. Of course, the present
<br>
administration is moving in the other direction, so that is not too good a
<br>
sign! Even if these laws were rewritten, there are other reasons for
<br>
privacy, or other concerns that need to be addressed.
<br>
<p>The main problem I see it today is that privacy advocates are not willing to
<br>
give an inch on privacy, but whether we like it or not, the police state is
<br>
coming. Rather than fight it, we should work to make it fair and just, as it
<br>
is a train that we cannot stop, nor should we as it serves a purpose, to
<br>
catch Terrorists etc.
<br>
<p>But that is what we must keep our leaders responsible for. Let them mess
<br>
with Terrorists. But do not let them lump drug dealers and sodomizers into
<br>
that group. &quot;We must protect our children&quot; must be used carefully, against
<br>
&quot;real&quot; terrorists, not anybody the administration feels like demonizing.
<br>
<p>It is easy to say that anyone who does not agree with us is a terrorist, and
<br>
the fact that they fight back makes them terrorists. It is easy to abuse,
<br>
will our other war on drugs become a second front, with massive civil
<br>
liberties infringement upon ~20% of the Earth population. Drug users
<br>
terrorists? They have TV ads now making headway in that direction. Columbia,
<br>
Peru, Brazil, etc are places that nobody seems to think about, but we are
<br>
very involved in them.
<br>
<p>At any rate, that is why we have the website, a lot of discussion *should*
<br>
happen to enable us to find the right path. Unfortunately, many people seem
<br>
to think it is too abstract or farfetched an idea to consider - that the
<br>
surveillance state is coming.
<br>
<p>It should not become a police state, it should become perhaps community
<br>
policing.

<p>Erik Sayle
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The time frame is the problem.  Conrad and I, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarcho-capitalists, agreed that the state would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately not be able to solve the problem.  &quot;Who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guards the guards?&quot;  Etc.  Only a competitive system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centered around the rational costs of risk and risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; management, involving insurance companies primarilly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be able to properly balance marginal returns to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimize such a system long term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, we are not there.  Our anarcho-capitalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utopia is decades off, and the threat of annihilation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a bit closer.  Not that Bush and Co. are likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be closet anarcho-capitalists...  So, they use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hammer they do have, the U.S. coercive military might.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, they're not planning a new Roman empire, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as I can tell.  Instead, they've used Afganistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and now Iraq as demonstrations to the world as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intent, capability, resolve...  The rest of the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can join the winning team or take their chances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, based on the Chronkite hosted Armaggedon series
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a host of other clearly orchastrated media events,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here it what to expect:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush &amp; Co. will manipulate events to suck the majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the important world powers - the so-called &quot;good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guys,&quot; all more or less democracies or otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certifiable as &quot;friendly&quot; - into a coalition that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back a joint force that will go into any country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere, anytime, if it is deemed necessary to clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out terrorist camps.  A few more examples may be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - N. Korea is waving a red flag with a huge &quot;target me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now&quot; ideogram etched across, and they may fulfil their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own prophecy, altho it may be the Chinese, who want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world to know that THEY are not irresponsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists (even if they are, whenever they think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get away with it) and are macho enough to do their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part for the new world order, not just wait for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. to run everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it may well go.  The real bad guys like Saddam will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fall all over themselves to invite the World Police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (&quot;World Security Forces?&quot; - somebody come up with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catchy name here...) inspectors in to verify that THEY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have any terrorists mixing up variants of SARS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. - if they believe that the alternative is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened to Saddam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, the problem that Conrad identified may actually be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solved, short term, altho the solution will bring its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own serious problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given that we're not likely to stop this from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening if it's in the works, the question becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to best deal with it and the new problems it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Possibilities:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;nanocorp&quot; movement is apparently growing like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wildfire and may quickly become international.  I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushed something similar for decades now, based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;trust,&quot; however, instead of the corporation.  Either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, there is and will be a demand for nano-support,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano-infrastructure, etc., which could involve easilly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standardized contracts, such as the universal social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contract that I have suggested, which could become a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world-unifying standard, and a grass-roots,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-sustaining base from which to oppose the top-down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporatization of the world that will try to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of this new world order.  Not so much to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose it, however, as to offer solutions not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to top-down structures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eg., the problem that Bush &amp; Co. are faced with now re
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility that &quot;democracy&quot; in Iraq may well mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another Iran, with enforced Shiite culture, forced on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all other groups in Iraq.  How to deal with this and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; host of similar problems?  How about a Swiss model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried down to the individual level, with a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contract to establish a base-line on which to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local solutions?  Perhaps most Shiites and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential democratic dictatorial groups would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfied to impose their law on their own believers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if a system were universally available to resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disputes outside the group in an equitable manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This may be more palatable if the alternative is a mix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ongoing civil war and outside rule by the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike &quot;political&quot; solutions per se, a social contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based system would be fueled by the economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages to the signatories, such as a means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reducing risk enormously in dealing with trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partners worldwide.  Yet it could be used to solve a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; host of political problems as a bonus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, we may not really be any worse off due to Bush &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Co., yet..., altho the civil rights violations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domestically as well as the wierd situation re &quot;enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combatants&quot; are certainly very scary and will have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be resolved.  I put some limited faith in our judicial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system to ultimately straighten that out into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something a little more consistent with our Bill of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rights, at least.  The world may actually be safer for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a decade or two due to Bush &amp; Co./World Police Force,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altho there is always the risk that some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist types may make a major move before they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rooted out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I.e., we may have a breather here in which to figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the real solutions.
</em><br>
