<em>&gt; Lewisite acts similarly to mustard: &quot;with Lewisite the skin commences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to redden at the end of 30 minutes; then erythema increases and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreads rapidly&quot;.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'd like to add that, despite the denials of others here, a facility
<br>
was found this past week with barrels of containers clearly labeled
<br>
&quot;Lewisite/Mustard&quot; and &quot;Tabun&quot;.
<br>
<p>Deniers are erroneously taking the refusal by the DoD to confirm the
<br>
existence of the characteristics of the actual chemical contents (until
<br>
samples are tested by labs here) as some sort of retraction. I have
<br>
been studiously watching the news on many channels and have not seen
<br>
any reports where the DoD has clearly stated that any materials found
<br>
were not in fact chemical weapons. Deniers are assuming that when
<br>
Rumsfeld says &quot;We have not yet found any chemical weapons&quot;, that he is
<br>
affirming that all past reports were false. Rumsfeld is, like his
<br>
stance on whether Saddam is alive or dead, is refusing to state
<br>
anything in the affirmative either way until it is conclusively proven
<br>
by scientific evidence. Evidence has been gathered. Evidence exists by
<br>
the boatload. That evidence has not yet completed testing in a US
<br>
controlled facility.
<br>
<p>Another denier tactic is to assume that just because a chemical agent
<br>
dates back to WWI that it is somehow less 'serious' or 'dangerous' than
<br>
newer chemical weapons. While Lewisite and Mustard date to WWI and
<br>
Tabun dates to the 1930's (when it was invented by the Nazis), they are
<br>
all quite capable of killing soldiers. Used in concert, they are quite
<br>
effective. While mustard and lewisite are described as 'blister
<br>
agents', it is assumed that this means they only irritate and make
<br>
blisters on the skin. This is false. Inhalation of airborne mustard or
<br>
lewisite will cause pooling of fluid in the lungs and asphyxiation.
<br>
Even a partial respiratory exposure will leave the individual scarred
<br>
for life, bed ridden and/or dependent on bottled oxygen.
<br>
<p>Blister agents are quite effective as an opening attack because even
<br>
slight diffuse amounts on the skin will erupt blisters when rubbed in.
<br>
This occurs especially during an attack where the gas mask contacts the
<br>
skin, causing itching, pain, and blistering along the edge of the gas
<br>
contact with the skin. This induces many individuals to remove their
<br>
masks due to the irritation.
<br>
<p>Tabun is a nerve agent. It causes the diaphragm and other musculature
<br>
to become paralyzed by blocking the relaxation signal sent by nerves to
<br>
muscle fibers.
<br>
<p>Simple asphyxiation is the least of your worries with nerve agents like
<br>
this. If the individual is amped up on adrenaline at the time, it is
<br>
entirely possible for the individuals muscles to tear themselves from
<br>
their ligaments. Tabun is meant to be used as a secondary attack, after
<br>
a blister agent like mustard or lewisite is used, because soldiers
<br>
induced into removing masks by the irritation will then become
<br>
vulnerable to nerve agent attack.
<br>
<p>These two agents are extremely dangerous, and while agents like VX are
<br>
hyped as 'more dangerous' by such movies as &quot;The Rock&quot; because they are
<br>
effective at much lower dosage levels, these agents are still among the
<br>
scariest things man has invented.
