<p><em>&gt; schools were reintroduced just a few years ago), I have always wondered

</em><br>
<p>Roughly, with variations.  Some parents go for formal curricula or lesson
<br>
plans, some are looser.  Loosest is the &quot;unschooling&quot; branch, where the kids
<br>
are let to do stuff they're interested in, including non-academic stuff, with
<br>
the idea that they learn by doing.  If they seem to be learning more car
<br>
mechanics than calculus, well, maybe your kid wants to be a car mechanic, you
<br>
snooty academic parent...  besides, they'll pick up more math if they decide
<br>
to start a business.  _The Teenage Liberation Handbook_ is a source, I think.
<br>
For kids pulled out of school the initial &quot;deschooling&quot; phase can last up to a
<br>
year, I think.  But the idea is that utterly idle humans don't *like* idling
<br>
and vegetating, and eventually your traumatized child will recover and leave
<br>
the TV.  Of course, if you start them this way from an early age and don't
<br>
have a TV around they'd probably do even better.
<br>
<p>I think, from what I've heard, that this does work for some people.  Whether
<br>
it works for everyone is one of those things.  But then, normal schools don't
<br>
seem to work for everyone -- the top beneficiaries seem to be studious types
<br>
who get along with the teacher and the irrepressible self-learner types.  But
<br>
then the unschooling philosophy is that everyone starts out a self-learner,
<br>
it's just that most children get oppressed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While this sounds wonderful, it also seems to be extremely demanding on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their time and capacity if they are working. 
</em><br>
<p>Well yes, it does help if at least one parent is home with the children.
<br>
<p>As for time, one idea is that less time need be spent on the same material.
<br>
You don't waste time on administrative stuff like attendance, hopefully you
<br>
don't have discipline problem, and there's the whole intense tutoring aspect,
<br>
so a few hours of parental instruction can map to a whole day at school.  And
<br>
that's the more formal kinds; unschoolers cut their kids loose and are
<br>
available to help out.
<br>
<p>David Friedman links to a school which sounded like a scholastic version of
<br>
unschooling.  Sudbury Valley schools, I think.  The kids aren't even forced to
<br>
read, the idea being when they're ready they'll want to learn the mysterious
<br>
language around them.
