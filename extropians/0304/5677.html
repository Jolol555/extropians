</em><br>
<p>I am one of the 1,001 types of relativists, but not an &quot;absolute
<br>
relativist&quot;. I don't owe blind loyalty to &quot;moralities&quot; (evolved human
<br>
customs which may be irrational or non-beneficial to me), but I have a
<br>
situated viewpoint, and an embodiment, which give me a very definite
<br>
subjective position. That position undergirds my &quot;aesthetics&quot; because I am
<br>
very self-consciously aware of how things matter *to me* (not to the
<br>
abstract Generalhuman, or God, or Society, etc.). I assume everyone else
<br>
may also be just as aware of how things matter *to them*, which could be
<br>
something very different than it is with me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To summarize my impressions about your views, you were saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;force&quot; or &quot;violence&quot; are strictly aesthetic concepts, have no important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship to the concept of reciprocity, that there is no substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical difference between violence as I defined it (e.g. rape and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder), and &quot;economic force&quot;, including the subjective harm of seeing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billboard. You are blurring any ethical distinctions between voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and involuntary acts, denying the existence of voluntary interactions.
</em><br>
<p>I see an *ethical* difference between violence such as rape and murder on
<br>
the one hand, and putting up billboards, on the other hand. But
<br>
I analyze them both mechanically as exercises of force. One exercise of
<br>
force I would really object to being applied to myself, the other exercise
<br>
of force I would only mildly object to being applied to myself. (I am
<br>
politically so lazy I could not imagine bothering to try to stop people
<br>
from putting up billboards. There are so many other more efficient ways to
<br>
improve my lifestyle.) 
<br>
<p>Voluntary acts arise from decision-making centers
<br>
in the brain, which are formed mechanically by conception and birth
<br>
(cellular replication and differentiation of the organ) and environmental
<br>
influences (chemical environments during the previous stage, sensory
<br>
inputs, conceptual memories, etc. etc.). As systems, they process input to
<br>
provide feedback. They are continually open and dynamic to the
<br>
environment, exercising force (ultimately through muscular controls) and
<br>
having forces exercised upon them. I am not trying to reduce analysis, but
<br>
this is the real ground of the explanation of why economic forces can
<br>
affect&quot;voluntary&quot; decisions. Everything is ultimately grounded in one system -
<br>
force cannot be attributed to one original cause or traced to any final
<br>
single consequence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, you postulated the need to use complex rules to replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal principles derived through hundreds of years of legal practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the simple distinctions I described, although  you did not provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a means of assessing the validity of such complex rules. Also, you deny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the validity of personal responsibility, instead describing individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors as results of &quot;forces&quot; depriving an individual of choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally, you define ethics aesthetics in a manner at odds with commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted usage.
</em><br>
<p>Assessing the validity of the complex rules - the validity of the theories
<br>
have to rest in the best, most all-encompassing understanding of human
<br>
beings and their societies and cultures we have. Certainly a work in
<br>
progress, but the law in most cases has been insulated from many insights
<br>
of the various disciplines. Perhaps the reason is that any adjustment
<br>
would involve mind-boggling, wholesale changes - even a displacement of
<br>
&quot;law&quot; as we know it.
<br>
<p>Personal responsibility is real at a certain level, the level of personal
<br>
introspection through cultural categories. But in the most detailed,
<br>
material analysis it disappears. To put it into a simplistic
<br>
slogan: nobody is ultimately responsible for anything - everything just is
<br>
the way it is. Part of what a lot of things are, is &quot;responsible&quot;. But
<br>
they are not ultimately responsible for being responsible :)
