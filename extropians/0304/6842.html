Since this failed to go offlist, and I'm not at my limit, may as well reply
<br>
to say that I'm chewing over this protein creation vrs non-creation thing
<br>
and concluding that I need to wait for other people to do more research.
<br>
<p>Based on watching the growth of the health-food industry (I'm just about old
<br>
enough to remember that you went to one small specialty store to get your
<br>
health food back in the day) I think that a PR-based diet (assuming that
<br>
this works, etc) stands a real chance of doing well. Of course, it'll take
<br>
10 years to get anywhere with that...by which time one would hope that:
<br>
<p>a) the gene-and-protein-expression-tinkerers have figured out a pill/therapy
<br>
that does the same thing as CR.
<br>
b) regenerative medicine can fix most of the major degenerative diseases and
<br>
researchers are starting in on building therapies for the root causes of
<br>
aging.
<br>
<p>If neither has happened in a decade from now, I, for one, will be
<br>
disappointed.

<em>&gt; Subject: (OFFLIST) RE: specific amino acid restriction does the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing as calorie restriction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I am reaching my eight-posts-per-day limit, so this is off-list.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only way I know of currently to activate these pathways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is to remove some of the essential amino acids from the diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should this read &quot;non-essential&quot; amino acids?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Essential&quot; aminos are those that cannot be synthesized in the body from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other aminos and must be eaten in the diet.  &quot;Non-essential&quot; aminos are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those that can be synthesized in the body from other aminos and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be eaten in the diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think eliminating some &quot;non-essential&quot; aminos in the diet would lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more synthesis of new aminos from other aminos and the synthesis of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteins.  Eliminating &quot;essential&quot; aminos would cause a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deficiency that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body could not recover utilizing other aminos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only way I know of currently would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be to live on a diet biased towards beans or corn.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; both of these may be deficient in one or more of the essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amino acids (Harvey or gts or someone may want to confirm this).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep.  They are not totally deficient in any one, but there is a definite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limiting factor where some are represented at much higher levels than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.  Beans and corn are both &quot;incomplete&quot; proteins which can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be combined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together to form &quot;complete&quot; proteins, but the body would have to put them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together.  (Nutritional labels only show the &quot;complete&quot; protein portion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;incomplete&quot; portions are not reported.  Combining beans and corn will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in more complete protein being available to the body than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two protein labels would indicate.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just posted some comments that my veggie diet might have this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side-effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of creating more new proteins, and I am intrigued about this PR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sure if the protein restriction is reducing the amount of protein the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body can produce, or if it avoids the condition of excess proteins being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available that are not needed.
