<em>&gt; &gt; Okay, we have to distinguish the out of sort feelings that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people from extended family structures might feel as they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become less extended, and vice versa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        That comment is valid but I think the reality goes much further.  If I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at the misgivings my wife and I had when we discovered what we were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letting ourselves in for when we accepted the inducements to become a &quot;Modern 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Middle-class Family&quot; (lets use your term) then our feelings went much further 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than simply being &quot;out of sorts.&quot;  Today having read Gatto I say if his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism is sustained then the modern middle class society and family is at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least mildly dysfunctional.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess we need some historical examples of societies whose
<br>
families were *not* dysfunctional.  Everywhere I read, whatever
<br>
society it is that is being discussed, the family for one reason
<br>
or another appears &quot;dysfunctional&quot;.  Nineteenth century families
<br>
are described as being sexually repressed, or male dominated.
<br>
Today's families are described as being unstable, and so forth.
<br>
Undoubtedly it depends on the values of the writer.  So probably
<br>
we should try to identify
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) what works best at a given point in history
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) what might appear to &quot;work best&quot; over time given
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the values of the people in the discussion (e.g.,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's not acceptable for husbands to beat wives)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) what is the ESS at any point in time, i.e., what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leads to the greatest fitness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) what is the ESS, if it exists, over most points 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) what is in 2003 the ESS, again in terms of fitness
<br>
<p>The key concept in several items here is *fitness*, which
<br>
should be taken in its objective Darwinian meaning.  If
<br>
for example North America becomes predominantly Hispanic
<br>
in the 21st century, that will be an indication that the
<br>
structure of Mexican families is closer to an ESS than its
<br>
rivals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also said, &quot;What is germane to this discussion is which kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life is more of an ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy).&quot;
</em><br>
<p>A further complication, as if there weren't enough already, is
<br>
that in 2003 we anticipate a Singularity some time in the current
<br>
century.  To embrace or credit any ESS in the above senses (a)-(e)
<br>
is a conservative strategy supposing a remote Singularity, perhaps
<br>
one not even occurring until the next century.  But if a Singularity
<br>
occurs within just a few years, talk of an ESS will lose much of
<br>
its salience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think determining which is the best ESS is what we need to be discussing. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I do want to emphasize that I am looking at an evolutionary society 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a static one.  The problem with the southern middle class society was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in many ways it was too static.
</em><br>
<p>Why would you say so?  Was (or is) it likely to be too unaccepting
<br>
of new ideas, have too little emphasis on education, or what?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you have any basic list that you believe people need to read before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaging the keyboard?  &lt;G&gt; I will start with Gatto and de Soto.
</em><br>
<p>Not really.  This subject seems to lie in the intersection of 
<br>
history, evolutionary psychology, anthropology, and acceleration
<br>
studies (futurism).  Few academics have dared go here for fear of
<br>
brickbats, so it's about as virgin as Sociobiology was in 1970.
<br>
<p>I hope that we can get into a nice argument about Gatto, and that
<br>
Michael Wiik will join in (although I don't think that he likes
<br>
to criticize or get criticized too much).  He has read a lot of
<br>
Gatto, and we started a discussion about it in the summer.
<br>
