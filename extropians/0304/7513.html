diets. I 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mentioned that in my view humans are as well adapted to paleodiets as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; giraffes are well adapted to eating the leaves of tall trees. In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; giraffes this dietary adaptation is extremely obvious. Unfortunately 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in humans our dietary adaptive traits are mostly invisible, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; buried in our metabolisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gts, I say again that you are making the classic Panglossian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Living organisms are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapted to the environments in which they evolved.  That is, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when living  organisms adapt, they adapt to their environments, rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than something else.  
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It does not follow that an organism is &quot;best adapted&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even &quot;well adapted&quot; to that environment.  
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;best adapted&quot; I mean &quot;genetically adapted best to the organism's own
<br>
environment vs some other environment in which the organism did not evolve.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The diet that is best suited to an organism that adapted to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paleolithic diet is not necessarily a paleolithic diet. 
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, how many times must I repeat myself?? If you are not going to read
<br>
my messages carefully please don't respond to them. I have stated numerous
<br>
times, including in my last message here to addressed specifically *YOU*,
<br>
that I do not reject the notion that the paleodiet can be improved by modern
<br>
medical and nutritional science. 
<br>
<p>It so happens that I consume many non-paleo substances on a daily basis,
<br>
including extremely non-paleolithic chemicals like aminoguanidine and
<br>
selegiline.
