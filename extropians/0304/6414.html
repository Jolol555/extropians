From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Predictable%20catastrophes%20of%20human%20stupidity">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here, you evidently mean, in context, that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn out not to be friends of the U.S.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision about Libra's Qadhdhafi had to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been made during the cold war;  therefore it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes interesting to ponder why he turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against his benefactor.
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^ I apologize for my ignorance, but help me out. Why would it be
<br>
interesting that he turned against the US? Qaddafi took power from King
<br>
Idris in a coup carried out on Sept. 1, 1969.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; This (if I'm correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so far) could imply that there exists genuine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and strong anti-U.S. elements of the population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of whose main motives is to be simply anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;^^^^^^I think there are such groups everywhere, even here in the USA.
<br>
Qaddafi had done a good job of breeding such ideas in the young. He was very
<br>
anti-western, and pro-Communist. Just like little Polish kids, the Libyans
<br>
had to learn Russian in grade school. However, Qaddafi is/was also very
<br>
anti-technology; anti-modernization. His goal was to turn society back into
<br>
a desert living nomadic tribal civilization, and to that end he destroyed a
<br>
lot of buildings and roads when he took power. Now it is 15 years since I
<br>
have had any dealings with the issues, and I don't know much about what
<br>
people there feel now towards Americans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ^^^^Attributes of a &quot;good&quot; choice.  Hm.  Very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hard question.  Very hard.  It is hard for me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to imagine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, then, this certainly weakens your criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Rumsfeld choice (I've forgotten his name,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and don't really know anything about the situation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^I don't think it does. I added that I can say what would be a bad
<br>
choice, and it was my view that Khoei would be a bad choice. I think that if
<br>
one suggested Qaddafi for leader of Iraq then almost anyone would say that
<br>
that is a bad choice, regardless of whether that person can name a good
<br>
choice. A specific person or group which would be a good choice does not
<br>
come to mind simply because I also haven't been too deeply interested in the
<br>
topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, hasn't Libya shown some progress?  I admit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all I'm thinking of is that Qadhdhafi has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (internationally) seemed very reasonable lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's denounced terrorism, and has taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility for the downed airliner over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scotland, and has recompensated the survivors.
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^^^ I wouldn't call it progress. Qaddafi sees that he can profit best
<br>
by his current moves. He is still a leader that the people do not want.
