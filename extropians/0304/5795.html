<p>
I was thinking about Hal's World of Knights, where all promises are honestly
<br>
kept, and lies are not a method of strategically dealing with others. It
<br>
occurred to me that not only the problem of information purchase, but all
<br>
public goods problems would disappear. There would be no need for patent and
<br>
copyright law, as Hal noted, since all information users would honestly
<br>
abide by contracts forbidding them to pass on information to others. Yet,
<br>
independent suppliers of identical information (independent inventors) could
<br>
still sell their product, since they would be able to prove having
<br>
independently derived the information, thus preventing monopolies.
<br>
<p>Additionally, the holdout problem, the bane of most public purchases would
<br>
be gone. In the classical example of the polluting factory, every individual
<br>
downwind of it would truthfully disclose the value of clean air to him, thus
<br>
preventing the situation where holding out on an agreement to pay for clean
<br>
air out could allow somebody to reap the reward without paying (the only
<br>
persons who would hold out would be those who truly didn't care about clean
<br>
air, and therefore should not be compelled to pay for it anyway).
<br>
<p>What a glorious world it would be.
<br>
<p>Luckily, as Ander's references show, the technology needed to bring about
<br>
the world of knights is getting ever closer.
<br>
