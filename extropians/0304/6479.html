Considering all the fan mail I got for my last three Chicken Reasons,
<br>
here are some more (and yes, I have authored all the ones I've posted
<br>
myself)...
<br>
<p>French President Jaques Chirac:
<br>
&quot;While we have great sympathies for the poor American chickens who were
<br>
so heinously fried on September the 11th, we cannot condone the
<br>
crossing of the road between Kuwait and Iraq by armored American
<br>
chickens. We will oppose with all of our diplomatic power any
<br>
preemptive and unilateral crossing of the road in the UN. We do not
<br>
believe that Iraqi chickens of mass destruction are crossing the road
<br>
in contravention of 17 UN resolutions, nor do we believe that
<br>
Resolution 1441 required the use of farce if the Iraqis did not
<br>
completely and proactively cooperate with UN Chicken Inspectors in
<br>
determining if Iraqi chickens of mass destruction have crossed the road
<br>
in any way. 
<br>
We think that inspectors need more time, given that the few attempted
<br>
road crossings have been stopped successfully, perhaps 6 more months,
<br>
when it will be far to hot for American Chickens to cross the road.
<br>
Even then, we will oppose the use of farce by American Chickens to
<br>
destroy Iraqi road crossing chickens.
<br>
We believe that the UN should control how Iraqi Chicken Coop
<br>
reconstruction contracts are awarded.&quot;
<br>
<p>German Chancellor Schroeder:
<br>
&quot;No, my opposition to use of American chickens against Iraqi chickens
<br>
of mass destruction has absolutely nothing to do with my needing to get
<br>
reelected. We Germans know far better than most anyone on earth, given
<br>
that we are the cause of the two World Road Crossings of the 20th
<br>
century, that caused the deaths of many millions of chickens as well as
<br>
the deaths of millions of innocent motorists, how horrible Road
<br>
Crossings are. 
<br>
We know the BirdBaathists, for it was founded by our Nazis, and we knew
<br>
the Nazis well, and the BirdBaathists are no Nazis.
<br>
We believe that the UN should control how Iraqi Chicken Coop
<br>
reconstruction contracts are awarded.&quot;
<br>
<p>Russian President Putin:
<br>
&quot;We are not selling Night Vision Chickens to Iraq, nor are we selling
<br>
Anti-tank Chickens developed since the first Gulf War to Iraq. We are
<br>
not selling Chicken Positioning System (CPS) jammers to Iraq, nor were
<br>
our retired military chickens in Bagdad as few as two weeks before the
<br>
war.
<br>
We think that the world should be made safe for neo-stalinistic former
<br>
leaders of national secret police agencies, be their names Hussein or
<br>
Putin. We object to the targeting of Leadership Chickens with JDAC
<br>
(Joint Direct Attack Chickens) weapons, for someone may get the same
<br>
idea with my government.
<br>
We believe that the UN should control how Iraqi Chicken Coop
<br>
reconstruction contracts are awarded.&quot;
<br>
<p>Osama bin Chicken:
<br>
&quot;The evil infidel Chickens of the imperialist US must be opposed by all
<br>
good devout muslim chickens. While Saddam Hussein is himself an
<br>
infidel, his people are muslims and the invasion of Iraqi territory by
<br>
the occupying armies of American Chickens and the lapdog British and
<br>
Zionist pig allies is a crime agains muslim chickens everywhere. It is
<br>
the duty of all good muslim chickens to go and fight the infidel in
<br>
Iraq.&quot;
<br>
<p>Al Jazeera:
<br>
&quot;No those Iraqi chickens are not cheering as they are crossing the road
<br>
to tear down those statues of Saddam. &quot;We love Saddam&quot; one Iraqi says,
<br>
as he slaps Saddam's head with the soles of his shoes.
<br>
That American flag wrapped around Saddam's head is not the same flag
<br>
flying at the Pentagon on September 11th, it is simply a sign that the
<br>
US is an imperialist occupying power, intent on making Iraqi chickens
<br>
cross the road in entirely unseemly and unmuslim ways.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now that that is out of my system, here are some more extropic ones:
<br>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowski:
<br>
The Singularity Institute for Artificial Chickens has released a new
<br>
programming language to be used for programming artificial chickens to
<br>
cross the road to sentience. Cluck 1.0 is an Empatho-Graphic Googling
<br>
language (EGG) meant to enable the average Artificial Chicken seed
<br>
kernel (Conciousness Oriented Recognition Nooite, CORN for short) to
<br>
grow a CHICK, or Compu-Hermetic Intelligent Chicken Kernel into a fully
<br>
emergent phenomenon, capable of crossing roads toward sentient
<br>
awareness. Eventually, the Artificial Chicken will breed an entire
<br>
Coop, capable of its own production of EGG languages of the second and
<br>
following self-programming generations, triggering a Singularity.
<br>
<p>David Freidman:
<br>
It is entirely the chicken's right to cross roads as it sees fit, and
<br>
engage in road crossing contracts with any RCA (Road Crossing Agency)
<br>
it sees fit. I will note that in medieval Iceland, chickens crossed
<br>
roads with complete anarcho-capitalistic liberty. Their only government
<br>
was the All Chicken, that anyone could participate in, and
<br>
disagreements were decided by a preisthood class of road crossing
<br>
guards.
<br>
<p>Anders Sandberg:
<br>
I've developed a new RPG called TurboChicken, where one can game road
<br>
crossing chickens in any environment. I've determined that in any given
<br>
Chicken Coop Dillemma, there are three types of chickens: those who lay
<br>
eggs, those who peck others eggs and those who both lay their own eggs
<br>
and peck others eggs. Those who peck and lay tend to be most likely to
<br>
cross the road.
<br>
<p>Richard Feynman:
<br>
It is theoretically possible for chickens to cross the road in both
<br>
directions. Road Crossing Event Diagrams can be interpreted as going
<br>
right to left, or left to right, backward or forward in time. When a
<br>
chicken crosses the road, it does not just pick the best possible route
<br>
to cross the road, it crosses the road in every possible way in a
<br>
virtual quantum state. The observer only sees the chicken crossing one
<br>
way because that way is the best way, thus collapsing the probability
<br>
function. This is the heart of the Many Chickens Interpretation of
<br>
Quantum Dynamics....
<br>
<p>Amara Graps:
<br>
Our work here at the Chicken Dust Dynamics Group involves the use of
<br>
probes to analyse the dust left by chickens crossing the road. In my
<br>
work, I have found use of wavelet mathematics to describe Chicken Dust
<br>
dynamics, which behaves significantly different from normal dust. While
<br>
many in the field call me a Dust Bunny, I prefer the label Dusty Chick...
