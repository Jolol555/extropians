</em><br>
<p>Don't mind me.  Just being precise.  I count the right conclusion for the 
<br>
wrong reasons as a loss.  Specifically, I object to the way you are 
<br>
attempting to claim the paleodiet is an a priori null hypothesis, rather 
<br>
than an experimentally supported *new* null hypothesis.  A priori, there 
<br>
is nothing in particular to distinguish &quot;eat what your ancestors ate&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;eat what tastes good&quot; as evolutionarily motivated hypotheses.  However, 
<br>
extensive research has shown that violation of ancestral invariants is bad 
<br>
for you, such as, e.g., eating ice cream, which mixes sugar and fat and 
<br>
messes up your insulin appetite regulation mechanism.  You can't eat a 
<br>
whole stick of margerine.  Your body will scream &quot;Enough!&quot;  But mix lots 
<br>
of fat with lots of sugar - which you almost never find in ancestral foods 
<br>
- and you can eat a whole quart of ice cream.  It tastes good, but it 
<br>
breaks the engineering assumptions.  Is it bad for you?  Yes.   Does it 
<br>
taste good?  Yes.  Is it in the ancestral dietary range?  No.  So if you 
<br>
accumulate enough examples like these, you eventually conclude from 
<br>
*investigation*, and not a priori argument, that the paleodiet is a good 
<br>
null hypothesis.
<br>
<p>I've also noted a disturbing tendency for responders in this thread to 
<br>
attack the weakest arguments for the paleodiet - that means *yours*, gts - 
<br>
rather than the strongest arguments, or those arguments which appear in 
<br>
the literature.  In other words, gts, you're using an argument which is 
<br>
much weaker than necessary - I'm not sure why - and people who, for some 
<br>
odd reason, want to argue about this, are responding to you, instead of 
<br>
reading the literature.  Note that nobody is bothering to respond to my 
<br>
posts, only yours.  This is because your posts are easy and fun to attack, 
<br>
because they use the weakest possible argument for a correct conclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my view the paleodiet is, however, still the base diet upon which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should formulate an optimal diet. Again, it's a question of burden-of-proof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I see it, any deviation from the paleodiet needs to be justified by solid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific evidence.
</em><br>
<p>Because of the empirical regularity with which past deviations have turned 
<br>
out to be negative.  *Not* because of a priori considerations.  The 
<br>
paleodiet took its fair turn in the burden-of-proof barrel *and now it is* 
<br>
a good null hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Trying to argue the a priori plausibility of paleodiet theory, without 
<br>
citing the supporting evidence, is, in fact, a worthless argument.  If you 
<br>
go on providing a worthless argument for paleodiet theory, the skeptics in 
<br>
this thread will go on arguing it to the exclusion of all other points raised.
<br>
<p>Accept that the burden of proof rests on paleo, then answer it.
