<p>Didn't Marc Stiegler write both of those books?  Didn't know he was a
<br>
Drexlerista.  (Didn't know there were...)

<p>I remember this description, so it's probably from David's Sling.

<p>&quot;It's not the process, it's the people.&quot;  Well, maybe.  But populations seem
<br>
to matter.  I'm on mailing lists for Lois Bujold and Steven Brust.  Both have
<br>
a lot of intelligent people on them, and some variety of opinions.  But the
<br>
Brust one had a really long religious discussion which totally failed to blow
<br>
up, and I'm sure the Bujold one would have done so in a tenth as many
<br>
messages.  I've been told in past years the Bujold list could have managed
<br>
such things, but it's become more flammable.
<br>
<p>If you've got a population inclined to name-calling or to paranoid judgements,
<br>
or to throw out conflicting data as flawed and biased (a common feature in
<br>
political arguments since a lot of statistics all around are flawed), I think
<br>
it'd be difficult to make progress.
