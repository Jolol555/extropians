Perhaps this was mentioned here before, but here is a rough number
<br>
of the Iraq civilians killed in the War in Iraq:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/">http://www.iraqbodycount.net/</a>  (currently inching up near 600 killed)
<br>
<p>The compilers on that web page state their methodology
<br>
and  their sources for these  numbers and they seem (I don't know
<br>
for sure) to take considerable care and effort to determine
<br>
these numbers.
<br>
<p>People aren't numbers. However, this is one of the most important
<br>
measures I presently have showing the precious (and outrageous)
<br>
costs of this war.
