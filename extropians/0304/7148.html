<p>
I'm not sure where nuts and starchy root vegetables (carrots,
<br>
yams, potatoes) fit in.  Are those in or out Paleodiet wise?
<br>
Insects and organ meats are not a big part of the western
<br>
diet anything else that might be good for us from a Paleodiet
<br>
<p>perspective?
<br>
<p><p><p>I don't hear anyone shouting against vegetables and I don't
<br>
hear anyone shouting for saturated fat.  Not a lot of people
<br>
arguing for added sugar or highly processed foods.  So, it's
<br>
whole grains, legumes, and low-fat dairy verses higher levels
<br>
of lean meats, fish and fruits.  Both sides like fruit it's just a
<br>
matter of how many calories.  Both sides like lean meats and
<br>
fish at least in moderation.
<br>
<p>Assume a 2000 calorie diet.  Start with the agreeable parts
<br>
of the food Pyramid (looked at from a &quot;whats the best way to
<br>
eat,&quot; not a &quot;what can I get away with&quot; perspective), all the
<br>
vegetables you can eat, 3 or 4 ounces of fish many days a
<br>
week, all the fruits you can afford calorie wise, some nuts
<br>
and oils, 3 or 4 ounces of lean meat, occasional eggs.
<br>
<p>So the controversial part is about 1000 calories, 500 in
<br>
whole grains, 200 in legumes and 300 in dairy (or other
<br>
high calcium source).  Paleodiet would say get rid of
<br>
all (or most) of that junk and eat more lean meats, fish
<br>
and fruit instead (maybe insects, organ meats, bones,
<br>
eggs and root vegetables also).  Am I getting this right?
<br>
<p>There are two questions I see here.  Which diet has more
<br>
and better balanced nutrients?  That is easy enough to
<br>
type into a diet analysis program.  Which diet has the
<br>
most of the most harmful substances?  Something I would
<br>
like to see added to diet analysis programs.  In both cases
<br>
the best we may be able to do is assume the beneficial and
<br>
harmful substances we know about are representative
<br>
enough to get the right answer.
<br>
<p>Which diet taste better and which makes people feel better
<br>
sounds like a do it yourself exercise.  Grains, legumes, and
<br>
dairy are cheaper.  I know grains, legumes and dairy do
<br>
okay verses the RDA even at CR levels (be odd if the
<br>
recommended diet did not supply the recommended
<br>
nutrients).  So which is more nutrient dense?
<br>
<p>The Paleodiet has more protein.  The Pyramid has more
<br>
carbohydrates and more fiber.  The Pyramid has more 
<br>
<p>calcium but when it comes to individual nutrients (and
<br>
<p>toxins) we can look at a lot of arguments about optimum 
<br>
<p>levels, balance between nutrients etc.  I suppose this sort
<br>
<p>of analysis is all an advocate of any diet theory can hope 
<br>
<p>for.  I'll get back with you when I get to typing the food
<br>
<p>into a diet analysis program (any recommendations for
<br>
<p>a good one, mine is old?)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I can see an argument that if no obvious advantages or
<br>
<p>disadvantages can be found the Paleodiet is the more
<br>
<p>conservative approach.  Probably not as convincing as
<br>
<p>the it's yummy and not know to be harmful argument.
<br>
Both of these diets sound healthier than the way most
<br>
people eat (except maybe the eggs and organ meats part).
<br>
And they both sound healthier than the Atkins diet.  ;-)
