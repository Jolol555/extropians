<p>Right -- just that I would go further: the code disparity has been
<br>
absolutely insurmountable wherever it has existed, and hydrophobicity
<br>
has been insurmountable for a few genes and very difficult for a few
<br>
others.

<p>Ah, I wondered whether you were thinking of something like this.  That
<br>
sort of experiment &quot;doesn't count&quot;, in my view.  These animals are so
<br>
high in cholesterol that the recycling system of compounds that are
<br>
normally no problem, such as unmodified cholesterol, is overwhelmed.
<br>
If you make an animal accumulate stuff at a hugely accelerated rate,
<br>
then sure, a lot of what they accumulate will be stuff that a normal
<br>
animal wouldn't have accumulated in the first place because they could
<br>
break it down, so if you then relieve the handicap they will go ahead
<br>
and break it down.  What this paper doesn't tell us (I've just read the
<br>
full text) is the key question: do the apoE-/- mice with transfected
<br>
human apoE have less lesion at 199 days old than age-matched apoE+/+
<br>
mice?  I bet they have more -- &quot;complete&quot; in the title is misleading,
<br>
since the text says there was a reduction from 220 to 28 mm^2 lesion
<br>
area, only a factor of eight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Genetically determined obesity (e.g leptin deficiency) manifests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early in life, and yet we know that maintenance of body weight is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamic balancing process, and can be tilted early or late in either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction. You can have fatty streaks appearing early and developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very fast, if your LDL is very high, in hereditary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypercholesterolemia, or they can develop slower, if you have only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western diet going against you. The balance can be out of kilter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of hereditary, or acquired changes in your genome, or due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-genetic changes (like formation of insoluble aggregates). So far we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have insufficient data to answer the question of the specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution of such factors in PD, AD, and, AFAIK, in most other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aging-related conditions.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the relevance of this.  My point about fatty streaks in
<br>
childhood is that they appear in the context of a normal diet: we all
<br>
get them in our aortas by the age of ten.  I agree fully that changes
<br>
to how much you push a homeostatic system will cause changes in its
<br>
equilibrium state (just like Desurmont's mice), but we're not talking
<br>
about any such changes here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### My boss, Davis Parker, likes the idea of clonal expansion, too. Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you think COX negativity must precede hyperproliferation if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis is true?
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't need to do so in ALL mechanisms of clonal expansion, by any
<br>
means -- but in Patrick's model, hyperproliferation must precede COX
<br>
negativity, no question.  I claim that my model for the mechanism of
<br>
clonal expansion (BioEssays 19:161) is the most consistent with all
<br>
available data ... but then I would, wouldn't I :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### If the effective number of mtDNA genomes undergoing replication is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller than the total number of mitos, then drift can occur pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast.
</em><br>
<p>True -- &quot;stem mitochondria&quot; is how Bruce Ames has described this.  But
<br>
it really only works if the effective number is 1, because there seem
<br>
to be very few cells with anywhere near a 50/50 ratio of wild-type to
<br>
mutant genomes -- indicating that cells pass through that middle phase
<br>
a lot faster than drift should allow.  Evidence for stem mitochondria
<br>
is conspicuous by its absence, so far.
