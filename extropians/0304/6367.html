</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The law forbids the man or woman
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So at least some portion of the population disagreed with your history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And they were present.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. There were contemporaries who objected to the legal process by which
<br>
the right of public access to &quot;common land&quot; was terminated. As I said there
<br>
were winners and losers. Tenant farmers (who were involved in the enclosure
<br>
petitions) were winners because they acquired the right to prevent free
<br>
access to their land. The class of landless labourers (cottars) were broadly
<br>
losers because they lost the ability to keep livestock and graze them on the
<br>
commons. However they did gain indirectly from the increase in agricultural
<br>
efficiency that the enclosure process led to. The verse you quote was quite
<br>
a common sentiment, particularly among Tories such as Goldsmith. Economic
<br>
change is always unpopular with those who bear the cost, for obvious
<br>
reasons. However the process of enclosures during the 18th century was
<br>
largely consensual. SD
