<em>&gt; If you mean animal foods are more expensive then I won't disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People have a right to save money at the expense of their health,

</em><br>
<p>The problem with plant food sources is specifically that they are so
<br>
efficient. It is this efficiency which is the cause of the plague of
<br>
obesity. Obese people don't get that way from meat, they get that way
<br>
from corn, wheat, and sugar overloaded in their diets. You don't become
<br>
a carbo-addict from eating meat.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the excuse that its wrong to eat animals because they are
<br>
less efficient sources of energy and nutrition is also false from an
<br>
environment perspective. The most healthful animals are free range
<br>
animals, i.e. those that specifically do not live in fenced in areas
<br>
devoid of diverse plant and animal life.
<br>
<p>If you want to reduce farmed areas, fine. You don't need them to
<br>
support a free range animal herd anyways. So we can have meat diets and
<br>
a healthy and natural environment.

<em>&gt; I notice that time and time again here on the extropian list that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater appreciation for the theory of evolution than many others. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe we are as perfectly adapted to a paleo diet as a giraffe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly adapted to eating the leaves from tall trees. In these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threads,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, few people are willing to grant that 4,000,000 years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hominid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution has optimized the human genome for a prehistoric diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I recall similar objections in the thread about DNA and personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing that our DNA is integral to our personalities, while many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were arguing otherwise. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There seems to be a general tendency among extropians to think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection is not efficient even over millions of years -- that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genome is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our enemy in need of being overcome by our powerful intellects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our friend in need of being seen as a partner in our development. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency here to distrust nature in favor of the intellect, and yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature that gave us that intellect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our intellects have very limited knowledge of proper diet. Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain unanswered. Nutritionists themselves cannot agree on proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They argue on television and at national health conferences. There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however no way to argue with millions of years of evolution.
