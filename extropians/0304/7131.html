<p><p>Going back for a moment to the very first message of this thread. I think that
<br>
question went unanswered:

<p>Well, the explanation I have *heard of* refers to East Asians rather than
<br>
American Indians and aborigines and it has to do with the elimination of
<br>
pathogens from water.
<br>
<p>The theory goes that in Europe people discovered brewing, relying on the
<br>
alcohol content of beer to do the job, while in the Far East people discovered
<br>
tea, relying on the boiling of water to do probably a better job. Given that
<br>
beer consumption was not restricted to adults in those times, selection
<br>
encouraged the spread of genes for alcohol detoxifying enzymes in the
<br>
liver. In other words, so the theory goes, infants that were given water were
<br>
more likely to die due to infection than those that were given beer were
<br>
likely to die due to liver problems.
<br>
<p>When I heard of this, on some tv program, I remembered that ancient romans
<br>
used to drink their wine diluted with water. I guess what their were actually
<br>
doing was disinfecting their water with wine.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
