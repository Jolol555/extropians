Those who know me off-list are aware that I'm no paragon of extropian
<br>
purity when it comes to my own personal fitness.  Slothful and
<br>
vice-ridden, I've often thought that if Max and Natasha were the
<br>
poster-couple for &quot;the extropian lifestyle,&quot; I must be the &quot;before&quot;
<br>
picture.  Well, among my other flaws, I'm vain, so recently I have had
<br>
to come face-to-face with the consequences of my bad habits.  Partly at
<br>
my urging, Max and Natasha got scuba certified last year and, now that
<br>
they've moved to Texas, we're about to go on our first dive trip
<br>
together in Mexico.  There's nothing more disgusting than a fat,
<br>
middle-aged bald guy in a wet suit.  Of these, the thing most under my
<br>
control is my weight, so a couple of months ago, when we decided on the
<br>
date for our dive trip, I decided I'd try to do something about my
<br>
physical condition.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>The combination of all these factors having dramatic results in a short
<br>
time is nothing short of astonishing to me: Being twice as strong, being
<br>
pain-free and carrying 10% less weight has made me feel like I've been
<br>
transformed into some kind of superman: I walk lighter and feel much
<br>
better. Even without the sugar and carbohydrates in my diet, I have more
<br>
energy as a result.  Given that many in our group have sedentary
<br>
&quot;brain-worker&quot; lifestyles and a survey of any EXTRO meeting reveals a
<br>
good deal of extra poundage and not enough lean muscle, I thought I'd
<br>
share this story.  If I can do it, anyone can.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>This is precisely the sort of thread we should have more often on ExI-L.
<br>
My thoughts...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, the better the condition of the support structure, the better
<br>
your wetwork functions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm much younger than Greg, inching closer to 29, but for several years
<br>
now I've been making efforts to improve my physical condition. Most of
<br>
my efforts have been in the long term column, resetting my life expectations
<br>
to one's more compatible with general sanity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I have found very helpful is the CRON mentality, specifically
<br>
the &quot;ON&quot; portion. Working towards optimal nutrition profiles in one's
<br>
diet is a very &quot;mechanistic&quot; thing to do, and may be easier for those
<br>
who find the wirehead ethos compelling.  Also learning to actually cook
<br>
is a good thing.  If you go exploring some new sort of ethnic cuisine
<br>
you can pick and choose your &quot;experiments&quot; based on their health merits
<br>
and suddenly you wind up with a head full of tasty health food recipes,
<br>
and much less junk.  I'm working on achieving the Optimal Nutrition
<br>
portion with the hopes I will be in a position to start restricting
<br>
by the time I hit 31.  I encourage all persons not trapped in the
<br>
military to cherish your freedom to manipulate your lifestyle
<br>
via improving one's cooking skills.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I've found very very useful is martial arts.  I plug the
<br>
internal chinese combatives to anyone whose interested, hsing-i/xingyi
<br>
and pa-kua/bagua.  Good conditioning, good meditation, and seriously
<br>
lower body strength figure prominently.  It's quite  possible to spend
<br>
30+ years perfecting something apparently simple like bagua's Single Palm
<br>
Change.  Another good recommendation is Arnis, escrima, or kali.
<br>
The Filipino arts are excellent, and are excellent values in terms of
<br>
defensive potential/exercise tradeoff with time invested. I don't care
<br>
for weights or for &quot;gym culture&quot; (nods to Greg and Natasha), it's a
<br>
personal quirk.  I manage to get plenty of conditioning from low
<br>
postures from the gung fu, and working Filipino double-stick drills
<br>
with weighted steel pipes manages to hit whatever general purpose
<br>
calisthenics don't seem to adequately stress. General arnis practice
<br>
is perfect for less fit people, it relaxes the mind, makes for mild
<br>
soreness,
<br>
and cleans the system by usefully spending aggression.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that high-rep free squats, hindu pushups, and the back bridge
<br>
(i.e. the Royal Court) are great for one's mental tone, and things
<br>
like assisted bar dips and pull-ups do wonders for your sense of
<br>
personal power.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted none of these exercises tend to produce the aesthetic
<br>
marvels of weight training/cardio regimens (nods to Natasha again)
<br>
but I find the more satisfying and suspect they will be more easily
<br>
sustainable.
<br>
<p>In summary, healthy chinese food, baguazhang, arnis, and the Bridge.
<br>
<p>Victory goes over a bridge!
<br>
<p>Brian
