fine, how's their diseases like strokes and heart attacks?

<p>Of course they do eat their veggies, and there's that red wine thing, and they

don't eat a lot...  of course alcohol isn't part of the paleodiet either.

<p>_Food Politics_ made the point that American farmers are rather

a book on Japan I'm reading, is to get people to eat more.  When 3800 calories

per American are being produced...  so there's a lot of political resistance

to the gov't ever saying anything as explicit as &quot;eat less&quot;, instead it's all

&quot;in moderation&quot; and &quot;part of a balanced diet&quot;.  Never never &quot;Eat less you
