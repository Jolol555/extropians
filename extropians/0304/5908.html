<em>&gt; No one is forcing you to run such an app, and no one is forcing the

</em><br>
<p>If I cannot get the content and apps I need to do my work 
<br>
without using TCPA then I am being forced to run it.  If it 
<br>
destroys alternatives then I am forced to run it.  It has very 
<br>
strong potential to do precisely that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Why would you revolt and attempt to kill this technology?  What gives
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide what technology to use?  You would not object if a person tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use cryptography to cloak his communications with someone else.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is wrong with someone using technology that lets him make a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commitment that is not possible today?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Because this technology is designed to kill choice and many 
<br>
things I hold dear.  It is not simply a matter of individual 
<br>
choice.  It is choice removed from individuals and enshrined in 
<br>
fundamental hardware empowering potentially or require 
<br>
potentially for far too many applications.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It frankly astonishes me that libertarians oppose trusted computing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe in freedom.  That means I accept that other people may make
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; an indirectly negative impact on me.  But I would not say that I was
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; using a technology like this.  I would really appreciate a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and freedom oriented explanation of why voluntarily-adopted trusted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing technology should be fought.
</em><br>
<p><p>It is about just the opposite of freedom.  You don't understand 
<br>
that yet, apparently.
