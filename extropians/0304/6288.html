<em>&gt; &gt; Far more than in the past, the current Arab conflict is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an information war.  Politicians are not so much struggling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with each other as news media are struggling with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The most dramatic losers so far: Minister of Information [sic]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Muhammad Said al Sahhaf, who will be quoted for comic relief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the foreseeable future, pretty much all of the Arab press
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whose credibility will take years to recover, and CNN.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Winners: FoxNews, who got it pretty much right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What exactly are you talking about?  Do you think CNN reported more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propaganda than FoxNews?  Or is it just that they refrained from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pro-American rhetoric and opinionated editorials that predicted the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there some specific factual examples that I missed where CNN got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and FoxNews got it right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, I only noticed opinion, editorial, and attitudinal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between CNN and Fox.  I don't recall any major factual or objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences in the news that was reported.
</em><br>
<p>That is because as a slightly left of center individual, you looked at
<br>
CNN, a slightly left of center media outlet, as broadcasting 'facts'
<br>
presented with a semantic flavoring that is consistent with your own
<br>
bias, while that broadcast of Fox was so obviously 'editorialized'
<br>
specifically because its semantic presentation did not match what you
<br>
were prepared to receive.
<br>
<p>What is important is that the predictions made on Fox were so accurate
<br>
because the Fox people had the most accurate impression and
<br>
interpretation of the facts to base their predictions on. CNN was less
<br>
accurate because it colored its predictions with its own editorial
<br>
outlook on the facts. Being a less accurate interpretation of reality,
<br>
CNN was fated to be less accurate in its predictions of future events.
<br>
<p>As an Egyptian said last week: &quot;Now nobody believes al Jazeera.&quot;
