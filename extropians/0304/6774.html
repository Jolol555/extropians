</em><br>
<p>I don't see how your argument along these lines can support your case
<br>
regarding the value of historical evidence in helping us determine proper
<br>
diet. Indeed it supports my case:
<br>
<p>The demise of the dinosaurs is historical evidence that the asteroid impacts
<br>
was not good for the health of dinosaurs, in a manner exactly analogous to
<br>
my argument that the poor health of early dairy and grain farmers relative
<br>
to their ancestors is evidence that the recent agricultural revolution was
<br>
not good for the health of humans.
<br>
<p>If we are going to accept the theory of evolution then we must accept the
<br>
premise that contrary to the false claims of creationists, historical
<br>
archeological evidence *is* real empirical evidence even when the events
<br>
under consideration were not witnessed in real time and have not been
<br>
duplicated in the lab. Otherwise we might just as well subscribe to biblical
<br>
creation theory to explain the origin of species. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, testing nutritional diets is easy to test.  It is fully
</em><br>
consistent to want 
<br>
<em>&gt; nutritional studies done.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. I should not need to remind you that the literature is already
<br>
replete with evidence from nutritional science that paleolithic foods are
<br>
healthy foods. 
<br>
<p>Paleodiet theory states only that those foods have been found to be most
<br>
healthy *because* they are the foods to which we are best genetically
<br>
adapted. This leads to the approach to nutritional science that Eliezer
<br>
seems to be suggesting and which I also recommend (in which any
<br>
non-paleolithic nutritional hypothesis is the competing hypothesis which
<br>
must disprove the default paleo hypothesis). Do you follow?
