<p><em>&gt; This is another link to a patient oriented audience regarding zinc.

<p>Just so list members understand the significance of zinc...
<br>
<p>There is an entire class of proteins in the genome known as &quot;zinc-finger
<br>
proteins&quot;.  They require a zinc ion to bind between 2-4 cysteine
<br>
amino acids (an amino acid that contains sulfur) in order to form
<br>
the correct protein structure.  These proteins in turn (after forming
<br>
the proper structure) bind to DNA to turn on (or sometimes perhaps off)
<br>
the production of other genes.  Not enough sulfur/cysteine/zinc and
<br>
the proper structures cannot be formed and the genes, esp. those
<br>
in your immune system, that your body would like to change the
<br>
experession of in the presence of bacteria or viruses, cannot be
<br>
properly regulated for their best effect.
<br>
<p>Regarding Christian's comments re: antibiotics vs. SARS.
<br>
<p>I'm a little bit skeptical.  According to the best reports I've read
<br>
the severe SARS conditions may be due to an over-reaction by the
<br>
immune system -- perhaps similar to sepsis.  So any consumption
<br>
of antibiotics isn't going to help the SARS condition and may
<br>
serve to promote the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria --
<br>
something that is becoming an increasing problem.
<br>
<p>Now of course, if it really turns out that the severe SARS conditions
<br>
are due to an immune system over-reaction then it might be a good
<br>
idea to remove sulfur/zinc from the system so the genetic program
<br>
may have more difficulty responding.  Quite a paradox.
<br>
<p>So my 2 cents would be that taking zinc supplements when one
<br>
is healthy or when one catches normal cold/flu is probably a
<br>
good idea but in the case of SARS (or sepsis) it remains a
<br>
very tricky question.
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>Side note: for those who don't know &quot;sepsis&quot; is an infection
<br>
where bacteria get into and spread through the bloodstream.
<br>
Its very hazardous and kills a relatively large number of
<br>
people every year -- in large part because the immune system
<br>
over-reacts to the situation.  Drugs are under development
<br>
to deal with this but as yet, to the best of my knowledge,
<br>
they have shown marginal effectiveness.
