<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was astonished early last year to learn that some highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent and thoughtful list members will not teleport.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is, on my &quot;Seven Levels of Identity&quot;, they are at level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The seven levels are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1.  Will travel by space warp, but won't permit disassembly of atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2.  Will permit teleportation, but only if the same atoms are used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Will teleport, unless there is a delay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4.  Will teleport, but finds backups to be useless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5.  Finds backups acceptable, provided that they've had no run time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 6.  Anticipates future experiences of duplicates, but only one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     particular.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 7.  Logically, but not necessarily emotionally, anticipates all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     experiences of all duplicates past or future, near or far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of these levels apply to me.  Or at least, I don't have enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to know which one applies.
</em><br>
<p>Probably I should have made clear that the questions solely
<br>
concern *survival*.  The question that one must ask himself
<br>
at each level is, &quot;Would I survive if this happened to me.&quot; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I object to the destructive copy operation.
</em><br>
<p>From everything that you have written, I think that we agree
<br>
about this and for exactly the same reasons.  Were &quot;destructive-
<br>
copy&quot; the only type of teleportation offered, I would attempt
<br>
to bribe the operator to not destroy my original.  I would
<br>
pay a lot of money.  I would encourage as much bribery as
<br>
possible for the sake of saving people's duplicates  :-)
<br>
<p>Here is a question for you:  suppose that an unknown person
<br>
living in New York City absolutely needed a serum, and for
<br>
contrived reasons, only you could deliver it to him in time.
<br>
The only way that you can arrive in New York in time is to
<br>
teleport by a method that (sadly) must destroy the original
<br>
as the scan is made.  Would you teleport?
<br>
<p>A second question is, suppose that this sort of teleportation,
<br>
again for technical reasons, was the only kind of teleportation
<br>
discovered so far.  Would you teleport across the pacific on
<br>
business, in the light of its cheapness and convenience?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not object to a non-destructive copying.  I do not object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the replacement of every atom in my body.  I don't mind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacement of every neuron and every tissue with an artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacement.  As long as no instance of me is destroyed in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process, I would embrace it.
</em><br>
<p>We agree, except that I'd sadly acquiesce in &quot;destruction of the
<br>
original&quot; scenarios, knowing that I had come &quot;that close&quot; to having
<br>
a bonafide duplicate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; My conclusion is that Harvey &amp; Lee know different sets of people.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It could be.  I don't think that I have heard anybody on the Extropians list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that we need to retain our same atoms to retain identity.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is a common misunderstanding that one side assumes for the other side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anybody claim this viewpoint for themselves?
</em><br>
<p>All I can say is that I remember that sometime in the last two years
<br>
someone on this list claimed this point of view.  It doesn't really
<br>
matter to me, since it's only a logical position.  If everyone agrees
<br>
that the particular atoms are not a factor in these discussions, fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we are wasting time discussing whether individual atoms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important until we actually find someone who holds this belief.
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree.  Let us agree not to resume discussion of whether
<br>
particular atoms matter until someone argues that it does.
<br>
<p>Lee
