</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There are some very important things I believe he gets wrong 
<br>
although mostly I think he is right also.  I think that we are 
<br>
largely conditioned to get many of these things wrong.  Here are 
<br>
a few of my thoughts on what we get wrong and what I think might 
<br>
be more &quot;right&quot; at the moment.
<br>
<p>The revolution of knowledge, of computation being the only real 
<br>
power and being that which brings or can bring all else into 
<br>
being,  directly questions old values and assumptions based upon 
<br>
material things in limited quantities and labor being the source 
<br>
of economic power and other real world power and well-being. 
<br>
The old way of thinking gave us capitalism, with some caveats at 
<br>
least, as the best workable solution for satisfying the needs 
<br>
and desires of human beings from a finite supply.   But now, 
<br>
within the limits of matter and energy itself, that supply is 
<br>
effectively infinite.
<br>
<p>The knowledge, once produced, of how to produce what we need and 
<br>
desire from raw matter and energy, also cannot be depleted by 
<br>
being used.  As a matter of fact knowledge grows in scope and 
<br>
refinement the more it is shared and combined with other 
<br>
knowledge.
<br>
<p>A great change becomes possible in our economic institutions. 
<br>
The limit of our ability to create and enjoy whatever we wish is 
<br>
not the limit of our salary.  Salary becomes superfluous because 
<br>
there is no need to put fences up in such an open and boundless 
<br>
commons.  There is no need to say that you can only produce X if 
<br>
you pay me because I originally figured out the pattern for the 
<br>
nanobots to make an X.  So what?  What need have I for salary or 
<br>
for charging you and thus requiring you to have a salary when we 
<br>
both can produce whatever we want using the technology once it 
<br>
exist upon the common knowledge base of humankind?  Why on earth 
<br>
(or off it) would we play silly joy/salary games in such a 
<br>
world?   It seems to me we can think up a lot more interesting 
<br>
and fun games to play.  Having thought of those better games, is 
<br>
there any need for policing me to insure I don't use what you 
<br>
figured out without paying you?
<br>
<p><p>Individuals all over the planet can have the capacity to 
<br>
practice boundless creativity.  They can have everything 
<br>
practically that they wish for.  In such a world where is the 
<br>
allure of &quot;mischief&quot; and of the hatreds of today?   Where is 
<br>
there a sense of being threatened or especially of being 
<br>
unfairly deprived?  Where is there a sense of desperation? What 
<br>
would be left as motive for wrecking paradise?
<br>
<p>I don't believe our greatest danger is each other.  I think our 
<br>
greatest danger is not having sufficient imagination and ability 
<br>
to embrace the new to profit from rather than to abuse our 
<br>
scientific/technological advances.
<br>
<p>Complete surveillance only works in societies that also have a 
<br>
very liberal (in the initial sense) understand of the rights and 
<br>
liberty of sentients.  In a society that has any ability or 
<br>
tendency for the majority to force its opinions on the minority, 
<br>
full surveillance is a horror far worse than any form of terrorism.
<br>
<p><p>Why on earth would we believe that &quot;we as a society&quot; possess the 
<br>
wisdom to control and police the development of all technology? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't this leave the door open for the majority to forbid 
<br>
stem-cell research today or all strong AI tomorrow and most 
<br>
nanotech the day after that?  The majority of human beings are 
<br>
incapable of remotely understanding the technology and keeping 
<br>
up with its development much less regulating it wisely.  Even 
<br>
the most elite minority cannot fully produce wise regulations or 
<br>
keep up.  As we ramp up toward Singularity this becomes ever 
<br>
more true.  So full surveillance backing quite limited human 
<br>
abilities to monitor and regulate is very likely to strangle our 
<br>
future and our possibilities wholesale.
<br>
<p>That speech becomes functional does not mean that speech must be 
<br>
regulated.  It means that speakers must be held to account for 
<br>
consequences and only that.  It is perfectly obvious that a 
<br>
tightly regulated society becomes stagnate to the limits of the 
<br>
competency and capacity of its decision making mechanism.  If 
<br>
that mechanism is political/bureaucratic it is very limited 
<br>
indeed and leads to great stagnation and oppression.  To use 
<br>
full technological power to enforce utterly inadequate decision 
<br>
making is the height of absurdity.
<br>
<p>The greatest unexamined assumption in this piece is the &quot;need 
<br>
for government&quot; per se. Actually the greater unexamined 
<br>
assumption is that we will be much as we are now but only with 
<br>
better toys and larger threats. I feel no &quot;sense of doom and 
<br>
need for autocratic rule&quot; from the ever growing technological 
<br>
capabilities.  I feel great unbounded hope, and limitless 
<br>
possibility.  Why are so many people today concentrated on the 
<br>
negative?  That is admittedly a mystery to me.
<br>
<p>Another archaic aspect of the article is the producer-consumer 
<br>
distinction.  As information increasingly becomes king and tools 
<br>
to work with that information become available to all (which 
<br>
after all is assume to power the threat scenarios), all persons 
<br>
who wish become producers as well as consumers.  Both terms 
<br>
increasingly disappear and society is a society of peers.  The 
<br>
possibilities inherent in technology are already too strangled 
<br>
by attempting to shore up notions that the few produce and reap 
<br>
most of the profit and that the many are their consumers only. 
<br>
The producers jealous guard the tools to allow the consumers to 
<br>
create their own solutions and share them.  It is another kind 
<br>
of needless fencing on the unbounded commons.
