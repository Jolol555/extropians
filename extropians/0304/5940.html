<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;No one is forcing you to run such an app, and no one is forcing the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;part in these kinds of transactions.  There is no need for coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;or a legal mandate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If I cannot get the content and apps I need to do my work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;without using TCPA then I am being forced to run it.  If it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;destroys alternatives then I am forced to run it.  It has very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;strong potential to do precisely that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We had some discussion in another thread about this kind of usage for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;force&quot;.  You may be &quot;forced&quot; to use TCPA in order to do your work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that is different from when someone puts a gun to your head and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces you to hand over your wallet.  The only reason you would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;forced&quot; to use TCPA is if other people that you wanted to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with would impose that condition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If I cannot use the OS of my choice and work the code on my 
<br>
machines as I desire without losing the ability to see broad 
<br>
sections of the net or to work with a lot of trusted hardware 
<br>
(there is talk of making peripherals only work fully in such a 
<br>
&quot;trusted&quot; environment) then I most certainly am being coerced 
<br>
into a scheme not of my choosing in order to line the pockets of 
<br>
its perpretrators.  It is a species of racketeering or perhaps 
<br>
we need another category of force altogether to cover such things.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But it is their free choice to limit how they communicate.  Part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom requires respecting the free choices of others.  You do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the right to impose your tastes and require others to communicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with you.  If they want to use communications technology that requires you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to run TCPA, you have no right to stop them.  So in this condition you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not truly being &quot;forced&quot; to use TCPA, but rather you are respecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the freedom of other people to decide how they want to communicate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do they have the right to impose their voluntary limits on me 
<br>
then?  Effectively, if it spreads to enough sides, cpus, 
<br>
motherboards and peripherals, I will lose the ability to choose 
<br>
differently.  I will become less free.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And of course, you can always refuse to use TCPA and attempt to convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others to communicate with you without those restrictions.  Persuasion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not force, should govern your relations with others.  Hopefully we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree on that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Fat lot of good that will do if TCPA is mandated and/or spreads 
<br>
to major feeds and devices too quickly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Because this technology is designed to kill choice and many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;things I hold dear.  It is not simply a matter of individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;choice.  It is choice removed from individuals and enshrined in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;fundamental hardware empowering potentially or require 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;potentially for far too many applications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you are concerned that if individuals choose to use this technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the eventual result will be a reduction in individual choice and options?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way that would happen would be if TC became very popular so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it was almost universally used, right?  Wouldn't that imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TC solved real problems for people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>No.  History is full of systems become widespread that did not 
<br>
solve problems effectively.  There is also no reason to argue 
<br>
that popularity makes coercion of the dissenters ok.  I am 
<br>
concerned with more than that individuals choose to use this 
<br>
technology.  This technology was purposefully designed to limit 
<br>
freedom and choice.  It is not a neutral thing as you imply.
