Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You might remember my speculation before the war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Saddam was not that good at media manipulation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The dear minister seems to have proven it
</em><br>
<p>His claims were, of course, mostly transparent to the West. I mean, his
<br>
sound bites were juxtaposed with pictures of what was really going on.
<br>
But I don't think he was expecting Al-Jazeera to 'CNN' him like they
<br>
did. He flew off the handle at Al-Jazeera reporters on a few occasions
<br>
for calling him out. 
<br>
<p>There is a pervasive Arab meme associated with the preservation of
<br>
'face'. In my experiences, even secularized Arabs will nearly always
<br>
allow even their stiffest competition to save face. They will very
<br>
rarely allow matters of business or politics to become matters of honor
<br>
or dishonor. Lying in an attempt to preserve one's honor is often
<br>
acceptable, and it is customary to simply play along, or avoid bringing
<br>
up the truth. I suspect that al-Sahhaf was charged with preserving
<br>
Saddam's honor in the Arab community and for the history books, and
<br>
Al-Jazeera's lack of complicity was unexpected and not a little
<br>
offensive. To be sure, Western aristocratic society boasts similar
<br>
memes. There's an ESS there somewhere, I fathom.
