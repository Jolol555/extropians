</em><br>
<p>First of all we seem to be able to survive on just about any diet, (which is
<br>
not to say that just any diet is optimal). The flexibility of our diet
<br>
suggests that we've been scavenging for any possible kind of food for a very
<br>
long time.
<br>
<p>The most remarkable evidence of scavenging the dead prey of other predators
<br>
dates back approximately two million years. I don't have the ref handy (ask
<br>
me to research it if you really want it). At least one site was discovered
<br>
in which it appears early hominids were breaking the bones and eating the
<br>
marrow of large animals which, at that early stage of evolution, they could
<br>
not possibly have killed themselves. I think I mentioned this once before.
<br>
It is some of the strongest evidence against vegetarianism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't seem adapted to eating meat
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from fresh kills&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>The scavenged meat from freshly abandoned kills would not contain a lot of
<br>
bacteria. And yes I think it's certainly possible that hungry early hominids
<br>
banded together in large number to chase lions away from the freshest kills.
<br>
Also lions, and presumably also their ancestors, fall asleep after gorging
<br>
their stomachs, regardless of any meat still left on the carcass. Later
<br>
hominids might have attacked and killed those sleeping lions for food and to
<br>
gain access to their prey, and/or smaller earlier hominids might have stolen
<br>
their prey surreptitiously. Intelligence in the making.
