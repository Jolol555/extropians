<p>Well, yes there is that formerly obese guy on TV who lost something like 100
<br>
lbs of weight by eating only deli-style Subway sandwiches. He has become the
<br>
new Subway spokesperson par excellence. His career in Subway commercials
<br>
took a major leap forward recently when he showed himself on a TV commercial
<br>
to be a nice guy with a nice-looking new wife and a big new house. His life
<br>
has changed dramatically for the better now that he's back to a more normal
<br>
weight (and now that he is earning big bucks selling deli-style sandwiches
<br>
for Subway). I wish him well. However I think his weight loss was not a
<br>
result of eating deli sandwiches, per se. It was rather a result of reducing
<br>
his caloric intake and forcing himself to walk to the nearest Subway
<br>
whenever he was hungry.
