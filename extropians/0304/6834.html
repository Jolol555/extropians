Yes, sorry to quote all and add just a few lines, but I endorse what RJB
<br>
said there. If you aren't comfortable with dying and you aren't practicing
<br>
calorie restriction, then there's something wrong with your logic circuits.
<br>
Similarly, if you aren't comfortable with dying and aren't devoting at least
<br>
some of your resources towards ensuring that the medical technology of the
<br>
future actually happens in time...

<em>&gt; &gt; Calorie restriction may be the healthiest diet until you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cut back too far.  Instead of radical elimination of a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; macro-nutrient, I prefer moderate levels of carbs, fats and proteins,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choosing the healthiest versions of each and avoiding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhealthy versions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of each.  This seems more reasonable in all areas and less radical or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experimental in any one particular area.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with almost everything Harvey said [esp. that which I snipped]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but would comment on the above segment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with this is that you end up dead, dead, dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are facing a cascade of technological developments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including whole genome engineering to allow genome augmentation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed by whole genome replacement (using robust molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology) followed perhaps by uploading.  The question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we face is &quot;How do we get ourselves to the time when we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surf each of these transitions?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, I agree with the &quot;moderate&quot; perspective.  *But* if there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;masked&quot; genetic programs that can be invoked to significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expand &quot;healthspan&quot; then I think one should seriously look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  CR is one such program that seems to be relatively intact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in terms of improving health &amp; aging measures) in the primate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies currently being done.  Selective protein restriction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be another such program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be the case that selective PR is an easier diet to adhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to than CR -- in which case it might help many more people extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their healthspans allowing them to &quot;surf the waves&quot; (cited above).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the best of my knowledge there have only been limited studies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done with PR.  And it may also be very difficult to separate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects of CR from PR.  But aging is a complex process it makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete sense (to me) that one might extend longevity by:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) reducing calories and therefore oxidative damage to DNA;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) increasing protein recycling and lowering the abundance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     inefficient/malproductive proteins damaged by oxidation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     carbonylation, thiolation, nitrosylation, deamidation, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trying to separate these effects at the experimental level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (if they both result in extended healthspan) may be *very*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So -- one needs to make decisions as to whether one wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe the &quot;theories&quot; and act on them.  If one waits for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;proof&quot; it may arrive too late.
