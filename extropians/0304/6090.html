<p>&quot;I am in absolute shock and awe that no one felt the events of yesterday were
<br>
worthy of mention.  Here the symbolic downfall of one of the worst murderous
<br>
dictators in the world took place, and people held under his oppresion
<br>
rejoiced and desicrated the stalinistic reminders of his murderous rule.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The events witnessed today were similiar in context to the destruction of
<br>
the Nazi headquarters in Berlin in WWII, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in
<br>
89.  People viewint those events witnessed the downfall of facism, and
<br>
totalitarian communism, respectively.  Yesterday we may have witnessed the
<br>
tipping point to the downfall of non-democratic oppression, the downfall of
<br>
the horrific statist imposed stagnation that has befallen the people of the
<br>
middle east for so many years.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&quot;The people were exhibiting pure joy, why no recognition of this salient
<br>
event in the history of the spreading of democracy and freedom throughout
<br>
the world?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Where is the joy at the spreading of freedom and democracy on this list, is
<br>
freedom and democracy not extropian, or are members of this list not
<br>
extropians?&quot;
<br>
<p>Very well said, Michael. Those tremendous events and images are certainly 
<br>
worth the attention and comment of everyone on this list. I myself was 
<br>
reminded of the scene in Ethiopia on May 21, 1991, and the few days which 
<br>
followed it, where thousands of Ethiopians celebrated the fall of the Soviet 
<br>
backed Mengistu regime. Children were playing a top fallen statues of Lenin, 
<br>
and like in Iraq, many people dragged the statues triumphantly through the 
<br>
streets. For me, this is a scene that never gets old.
<br>
<p>They celebrate the fall of the Communist Derg as the national holiday of 
<br>
Ethiopia, one can easily imagine that April 9th will soon become a day of 
<br>
yearly celebration and remembrance for the Iraqi people.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
