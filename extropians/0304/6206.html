The Truth in Trials Act described below would allow criminal drug defendants
<br>
the ability to cite their state laws with respect to medical
<br>
marijuana in their legal defense in court against federal drug
<br>
charges. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The huge relative proportion of democratic sponsors of this
<br>
bill suggests, to me, that the GOP is hypocritical with
<br>
respect to states' rights. What happened to GOP party principles?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Either you're FOR states' rights or your AGIN' 'em! The GOP can't
<br>
have it both ways.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Of course Republican Ron Paul of TX once again stands out as a
<br>
shining light.

<em>&gt;&gt; Dear Friend:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yesterday, at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Rob Kampia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Representatives Sam Farr (D-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), and Barney Frank
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (D-MA), introduced a new congressional medical marijuana bill, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Truth in Trials Act. (Please see

<em>&gt;&gt; the event.) This bill already has strong support. In addition to the

<em>&gt;&gt; three members listed above and Representative Dana Rohrabacher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (R-CA), who was scheduled but unable to attend the event, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 25 other original cosponsors of the bill.

<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Even in a time of war, there was a strong turnout by the media at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yesterday's press conference. Reporters from the Associated Press,

<em>&gt;&gt; Reuters: Bill Allows Medical Marijuana Defense in Drug Cases by Todd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Zwillich, Reuters Health April 10, 2003, 5:29 PM EST WASHINGTON --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; U.S. lawmakers have launched an effort that would allow defendants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from states with legalized medical marijuana to use &quot;medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; necessity&quot; as a defense against federal drug charges. A bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; introduced in the U.S. House Thursday and backed by pro-medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; marijuana groups would apply to California and seven other states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; where medical marijuana is legal. The measure gives defendants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accused of growing or distributing marijuana in violation of federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; drug laws the right to inform juries that they were acting legally in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their state. Supporters touted the proposal as a way to protect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; democratic process in states where voters or legislators
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; approve measures backing medical marijuana.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;This is about due process. It's not about pot,&quot; said Rep.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sam Farr, D-Calif., who co-authored the measure with Rep. Dana
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Rohrbacher, R-Calif. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The bill was motivated by the conviction of Ed Rosenthal, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Oakland-based marijuana activist who was found guilty in January of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; violating federal drug laws. Rosenthal was licensed by Oakland to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; grow and distribute cannabis under a California medical marijuana
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; statute, but the judge in his case prevented Rosenthal's attorney
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from informing the jury that the action was legal in that state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Marney Craig, who was a juror in Rosenthal's case, said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; she regretted voting to convict him. During the case, jurors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; were only informed that Rosenthal grew marijuana and not that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; he had been licensed to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;We rendered a verdict that was wrong. We convicted a man who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was not criminal,&quot; Craig said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that &quot;medical necessity&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cannot be used as a valid defense against federal marijuana charges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Thursday's proposal would change a key part of the federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Controlled Substances Act to allow state laws to become a factor in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; federal drug cases. Seven other states -- Alaska, Hawaii, Washington,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, and Maine -- have lawssimilar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; California's. Maryland has a proposed medical marijuana law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pending. Voters in the District
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of Columbia also approved a medical marijuana referendum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; several years ago, though the Congress hasprevented local
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; officials from implementing the measure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Federal anti-drug officials remain vehemently opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; efforts to spread legalized medical marijuana throughout the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; states. John Walters, the director of the White House Office
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), has campaigned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; heavily against legalization referenda in several states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Dr. Andrea Barthwell, ONDCP's deputy director for demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reduction, said that the bill threatens to undermine federal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; drug laws that are in place to protect public health, even if voters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in some states have spoken differently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;We recognize that federal law trumps state law in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; area,&quot; she said in an interview.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The bill's chances of passing in the Republican-controlled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; House are likely to hinge on support from GOP members from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the handful of states where medical marijuana is allowed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Some Republicans have backed the bill on the grounds that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; helps prevent the federal government from intruding on state laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But it remained unclear Thursday how many GOP members would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; support the bill. Rep. David Dryer, R-Calif., said in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interview that he backs states' rights &quot;in general,&quot; but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; he has not yet taken a position on the bill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Rep. Mary Bono, another California Republican, said that she
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; has yet to see the bill's details. &quot;I think that if the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; has spoken, then I'd want to support the state on that,&quot; she said.
