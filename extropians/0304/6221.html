<p>
You are correct that the women of Iraq don't have it as bad as the women in
<br>
Saudia or Yemen, for example.  However, I find that most people haven't the
<br>
experiences of being both an American woman with all the freedom that
<br>
entails and a woman who lived as a Muslim woman, at times complete with
<br>
hijab, among Arab Muslims for years. This experience, which I claim, is what
<br>
informs my view when I say that the women of Iraq, in spite of being more
<br>
liberated that their Saudi counterparts, are still entitled to the label
<br>
&quot;un-liberated&quot;.  It doesn't take a government to oppress women. The
<br>
oppression of women is inherent in the culture and religion. Certainly an
<br>
Iraqi woman, if the male members of her family allow, may be as free as her
<br>
brothers. The Iraqi government might have nothing to say -- unlike the same
<br>
scenario in Saudia wherein the government would crack down.
<br>
<p>Iraq's Hussein may have headed a secular government, and I have not been a
<br>
student of government; however, how secular can a government truly be when
<br>
that government takes government funds to build religious worship sites?
<br>
Hussein built mosques; he was in the process of building what was to be the
<br>
largest mosque in the world.  Doesn't a truly secular government mean that
<br>
there must be a separation of mosque and state?
