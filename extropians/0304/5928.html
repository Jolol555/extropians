<p><p>This article is not yet available on Discover.com; but I did find this 
<br>
comentary on the article I have read, and agree with the poster, Gunnar. 
<br>
Thermal de-polymerization is an area to watch, because of it low energy 
<br>
production usage, its high return, its contribution to elimination 
<br>
carbonaceous waste. Looks light a decent solution whose time, economically, 
<br>
is finally arriving. I am going to be reading up on thermal 
<br>
de-polymerization.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;&quot;In an industrial park in Philadelphia sits a new machine that can change 
<br>
almost anything into oil. Really.&quot;So begins a fascinating article in the May 
<br>
2003 issue of Discover magazine that I recently received in the mail. The 
<br>
article goes on to describe a fascinating and exciting new process that can 
<br>
convert virtually any kind of waste now going to landfills into useful 
<br>
amounts of oil and other benign products. According to the author of the 
<br>
article, &quot;If the process works as well as its creators claim, not only would 
<br>
most toxic waste problems become history, so would imported oil.&quot;
<br>
<p>The process is called &quot;Thermal Depolymerization&quot; and was developed by a team 
<br>
of scientists, former Government leaders and deep pocketed investors 
<br>
assembled by Brian Appel, Chairman and CEO of Changing World Technologies. It 
<br>
can handle almost any kind of waste product imaginable, including 
<br>
agricultural wastes, tires, sewage, medical wastes, old computers, oil 
<br>
refinery residues, and even biological weapons such as anthrax spores. 
<br>
According to Appel, &quot;waste goes in one end and comes out the other as three 
<br>
products, all valuable and environmentally benign: high quality oil, 
<br>
clean-burning gas, and purified minerals that can be used as fuels, 
<br>
fertilizers, or specialty chemicals for manufacturing.
<br>
<p>The proportions of each of those three products depends, of course, on what 
<br>
one runs through the machine. The first industrial-scale thermal 
<br>
depolymerization plant, recently completed in a lot adjacent to a Butterball 
<br>
Turkey plant in Carthage Illinois, will be used to daily transform 200 tons 
<br>
of formerly useless and disgusting turkey offal into various useful products, 
<br>
including 600 barrels of light oil. &quot;The offal derived oil is chemically 
<br>
almost identical to a number two fuel oil used to heat homes.&quot;
<br>
<p>According the article, &quot;Just converting all the U.S. agricultural waste into 
<br>
oil and gas would yield the energy equivalent of 4 billion barrels of oil 
<br>
annually. Compare that to the 4.2 billion barrels of oil that the U.S. 
<br>
imported in 2001! One great benefit of this is that the burning of such oil 
<br>
would not contribute to global warming, because the carbon dioxide released 
<br>
into the atmosphere from burning it could not possibly do any more than just 
<br>
barely replace the carbon dioxide taken from the atmosphere in the first 
<br>
place by the growing plants from which the agricultural waste came.
<br>
<p>I urge all of you to find this article and read it. I think you will find it 
<br>
quite interesting.
