<p>Yes, we seem to be on exactly the same page here, Eliezer. 
<br>
<p>Stated simply, the paleodiet is the null hypothesis. It needn't be proved.
<br>
It need only be disproved.
<br>
<p>For example mez makes the excellent and true observation that many diseases
<br>
of aging were &quot;invisible&quot; to paleolithic evolutionary forces. It is to mez,
<br>
then, to show that some proposed deviation from the paleolithic diet will
<br>
help to prevent or cure the diseases of aging. 
<br>
<p>I for one don't see how adding bread and milk will cure or prevent anything
<br>
whatsoever, other than simple starvation. 
<br>
<p>It is very interesting that the Old Testament calls bread the &quot;Staff of
<br>
Life.&quot; No doubt this is because agriculture helped millions of ancient
<br>
people avoid starvation. Bread was &quot;Mannah from Heaven&quot; to the ancients, who
<br>
faced starvation perhaps due to their over-hunting of the wild-game upon
<br>
which they had evolved. But starvation is hardly a problem for most of us
<br>
moderns living in the first and second worlds. Gluttony is our new modern
<br>
enemy. The Staff of Life has become the Staff of Death.
