I'm wondering if proteolytic enzymes such as papain or bromelain would cause
<br>
more protein recycling

<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to be claiming that if you cut out 1 1/2 amino acids of the
</em><br>
normal
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spread of amino acids in rat food, you get long-lived rats. Can the
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the list who are way far more knowledgable than me about such things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weigh in with whys and wherefores?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you dig really deep into the literature (and I mean *really* deep)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will find that restriction of some of the essential amino acids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. those that cannot be synthesized) cause an up-regulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein recycling.  As I recall there are multiple pathways that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be involved (which makes sense from a biochemical standpoint).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The effect may also have some species specificity because I doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that species are likely to encounter the same amino acid shortages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the variety of diets (of say mice/rats vs. humans).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The working hypothesis that others (and I) have had is that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you increase protein recycling one gets a greater ratio of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;new&quot; proteins vs. &quot;old&quot; proteins.  The new proteins are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damaged than the old proteins (from say oxidative or deamidation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage) and thus function more reliably/efficiently.  An increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the protein turnover rate may also cause proteins to be broken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down before they accumulate sufficient damage that the normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recycling mechanisms will not work and they end up accumulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as lipofuscin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For more information you want to do a PubMed search on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Cuervo AM&quot; and/or &quot;Dice JF&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its also starting to become clear that there are &quot;molecular clocks&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that determine the protein recycling rate -- see:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.deamidation.org/">http://www.deamidation.org/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems highly unlikely (at least to me) that the clock timings are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setup optimally to recycle proteins as the protein recycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery becomes less efficient due to it being blocked by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materials it is less able to recycle (e.g. lipofuscin).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would be a classic case of antagonistic pleiotropy --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. you don't want to recycle proteins too fast at a young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age because it wastes energy but when you get older and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recycling machinery is less efficient the timings are too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow to maintain the majority of proteins in an optimal state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this &quot;common knowledge&quot; within the aging research community?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can only state that I was at a lecture by Steve Austad, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I consider to be a leading aging researcher, last week and asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him whether he was aware of the molecular clock data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The answer was &quot;No&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose that is one reason why one asks the ExI list...
