<p>Summary of what war debates sound like:

<a href="http://www.minimumeffort.com/nutshell.html">http://www.minimumeffort.com/nutshell.html</a>
<br>
I think the reference to April is inaccurate.  But then, it's accurate that
<br>
peaceniks would bring her up in a debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Ron, mine, the Mikes, and many other posters determination to fully have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the record of the United States analyzed and the positive (and negative) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishments recognized and understood cannot be dismissed out of hand 
</em><br>
<p>Points I'd make: the influence of the US is larger than the actions of its
<br>
government.  I'd say the major part of any American influence toward democracy
<br>
is simply from existing, and from saturating the world with our popular
<br>
culture, and being so big that everyone has to pay attention to us.  When you
<br>
have arrested people in other countries screeching for their Miranda rights
<br>
you know we've done something good.
<br>
<p>When you look at government action it's much less rosy.  Sure, we're better
<br>
than the Soviet Union.  That doesn't take much.  (And for the record, the
<br>
Soviet bloc seemed to have better education than we do.)  We've also
<br>
overthrown elected governments, propped up dictators, trained death squads,
<br>
and turned a blind eye to abuses by our allies.  The State Department's report
<br>
on human rights came out yesterday, and Human Rights Watch said &quot;it's a fine
<br>
report, but is the US guided by it the other 364 days of the year?&quot;  Sometimes
<br>
we speak up, sometimes we don't.  We isolate Cuba, but trade with China, which
<br>
I think is a worse regime.
<br>
<p>And US influence, or US government action in the past, isn't a full
<br>
determinant of what the US government is doing now or will do.  One could
<br>
believe the US has done tons of great things in the past and also believe the
<br>
Bush administration is wrecking that record right and left.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; States is deplorable.  The freedoms that each and every human enjoys on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet (those fortunate enough to enjoy some) can all be attributed to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree to the United States. Yet some insist that merely because the US (or 
</em><br>
<p>They can also be attributed to some degree to Great Britain which spawned us,
<br>
and to France which spread Revolutionary values throughout Europe.  I know you
<br>
didn't say the US was the unique fount of freedom, but I thought I'd make the
<br>
points anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; any other country) is powerful and in a dominant world position, than it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad,  or &quot;might makes wrong&quot;, in huMania's words. This position too is not 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;power corrupts&quot; in the usual formulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; acceptable in any form to many on this list, and the record of the United 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States as compared to other major world powers, most notably the Soviet Union 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Nazi Germany, is a necessary part of illustrating why the position of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;might makes wrong&quot; is not appropriate in all cases.
</em><br>
<p>We have a better record; yay us.  It's not a perfect record.  And I think it's
<br>
a legitimate fear is that if we've resisted the corrupting effect of power
<br>
until now, it's finally come to bite us.  Or at least to bite the neocons who
<br>
dream of American empire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Illustrating that the United States helped foster and make possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy in Taiwan, Greece, South Korea, Japan, etc. is not &quot;holding up a 
</em><br>
<p>Greece was democratic.  Then it had a military coup in the 1960s or 1970s.
<br>
Then at some point it wandered back to democracy.  What role, if any, did we
<br>
play in that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; dominated by the USSR, while a great many proxies of the United States did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed develop lasting and stable democracies. It is completely legitimate 
</em><br>
<p>For example, Iran, a US proxy, had a revolution and established a democracy
<br>
which while highly imperfect is real and more than most of the Middle East
<br>
has.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Democracy and freedom are quite extropic, and thus the United States has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done more to spread EXTROPIAN ideals than any other nation in the world. This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not nationalism or blind patriotism, it is a statement of fact, an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation based in reality. To assert otherwise is intellectually dishonest.
</em><br>
<p>You know, if we were sufficiently bigger than anyone else, we could have done
<br>
more to spread extropian ideals and more to inhibit them than anyone else,
<br>
with a net effect of spreading but a real inhibitory effect as well.
