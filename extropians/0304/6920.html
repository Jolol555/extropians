<p><em>&gt; However, I still have a few problems with the Paleo diet theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Why are beans left out?  I don't buy the part about not being able 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to soak them.  Why do we suppose our ancestors had simple tools for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunting (spears, sticks, knives, axes, pits, etc.), but couldn't come 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with bowls, for example. I also don't buy the part about not being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to eat beans or legumes raw.  I love munching on raw peas out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the garden, and the Japanese have a long history of eating soybeans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cold and raw out of the pod. These things are easy to eat and digest.
</em><br>
<p>Legumes (and grains, yeast and dairy) contain lectins, which are thought to
<br>
cause or aggravate auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and
<br>
ulcerative colitis. Lectins are glyco-proteins evolved by plants to ward off
<br>
insect predators. It is known that lectins attach themselves to the walls of
<br>
the gut and increase intestinal permeability, allowing partially digested
<br>
food proteins and remnants of resident gut bacteria access to the blood
<br>
stream. In the words of Loren Cordain Ph.D., lectins are &quot;cellular Trojan
<br>
horses.&quot; 
<br>
<p>See <a href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7190/1023">http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7190/1023</a>. This is an article by an
<br>
allergist who has no particular interest or axe to grind with regard to
<br>
paleodiets, but who, like Cordain, sees lectins as a possible cause of
<br>
disease.
<br>
<p>If there is any question, then of course paleodiet theorists reject legumes
<br>
simply because they were not significant parts of prehistoric human diets,
<br>
suggesting that we can't be well-adapted to them. Remember that paleodiet
<br>
theorists start from the premise that we should not eat foods to which we
<br>
are not well-adapted. I would like to see some evidence that the Japanese
<br>
have been eating raw soybeans in any significant quantity for any
<br>
significant time. As far as I know, soy beans are practically indigestible
<br>
unless they are processed and made into foods like tofu.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  Why are grains left out?  Same thing.  Everyone seems to admit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that grains grew wild all over the place.
</em><br>
<p>See above regarding lectins. Also, the fact that wild grains were present
<br>
does not mean they were important staples of the prehistoric diet. I do not
<br>
doubt that prehistoric peoples chewed occasionally on wild grains when they
<br>
were hungry and could find nothing more flavorable and nutritious to eat,
<br>
but many such seeds are too hard to chew. There was some grinding of wild
<br>
seeds on primitive millstones in the late paleolithic or mesolithic, but the
<br>
evidence is clear that wide-spread cultivation of grains, in which the seeds
<br>
were planted and harvested in great number, did not arise until Neolithic
<br>
times. Indeed agriculture is largely what defines the Neolithic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The argument is again that ancient tools couldn't handle them.
</em><br>
<p>That's not really the argument. The argument is that, for whatever reason,
<br>
*agricultural technology* did not arise until the Neolithic and so grains
<br>
did not become an important part of the diet until the Neolithic. This is
<br>
evidence from archeology. Farming of any did not exist until recently.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3.  Speaking of not having bowls, this Paleo Diet seems to assume that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything needs to be cooked using an open flame.  Modern knowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tells us that this is the worst way to cook foods, especially meats.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charred food or even fire-cooked foods are more carcinogenic.  While 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this may not have bothered our ancestors who died at an early age, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly bothers me when I want to live well past 100.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree. Apparently you missed my discussion with Brian Atkins here in
<br>
this thread on that subject. Many paleodieters broil or boil their meats or
<br>
cook them very lightly over low-heat to minimize the (possible) carcinogenic
<br>
risks of HCA's. As Brian pointed out the evidence that HCA's are
<br>
carcinogenic is not unequivocal, and as I pointed out this is a perfect
<br>
example of an ambiguity of nutrition science. Paleodieters attempt to settle
<br>
the debate re: HCA's with evolution science. And even then there is room for
<br>
debate, depending on when one believes fire-cooking fist appeared as an
<br>
important part of the human diet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  I agree that humans are naturally omnivores, eating meat and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetables. But the meat-eating seems a bit exaggerated. It is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious or proven that the ancient ancestors ate huge amounts of meat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every day.  They probably had meat a few times per week, and foraged 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for nuts, berries, and vegetables the rest of the time.  Their diet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was mostly vegetarian every day, with boosts of meat occasionally.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see why this theory is so down on vegetarianism, when it clearly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supported humans most days.
</em><br>
<p>The studies of hunter-gather cultures I've seen suggest that HG peoples
<br>
consumed as much as 60% or more of their calories from animal sources, even
<br>
if they did not eat animals every day. Keep in mind that this includes
<br>
calories from fats and organs as well as from muscles. A single wooly
<br>
mammoth could feed a small tribe for several weeks.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 5.  Speaking of vegetarianism, most of the complaints against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarianism have nothing to do with modern day.  First of all, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone isn't a total vegan, meaning they also eat milk, dairy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eggs, then they are not missing out on all the animal-only nutrients.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plus, we have supplements today. Any modern person taking a well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rounded supplement won't have any of the deficiency problems.  Plus, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can mass produce food in ways never available before.  Maybe the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancients couldn't mass produce tofu enough for their diet, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corner grocery store can.  Most of the anti-vegetarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff I read here is aimed at theoretical diets that don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist any more, or aimed at pseudo-scientific claims that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have nothing to do with a life-extensionist diet that avoids meat.
</em><br>
<p>This is basically a nutritional science based approach to &quot;designer diets,&quot;
<br>
and while I don't reject nutrition science out of hand, (I'm a LEF member
<br>
and a customer), I also believe nutrition science is incomplete and fraught
<br>
with contradiction. 
<br>
<p>Getting back to my null vs competing hypothesis arguments, I believe we
<br>
should start from the premise that the paleolithic diet is the optimal diet
<br>
*and then build on it* when we find strong evidence from nutritional science
<br>
for non-paleo additions/subtractions to the default paleo diet. I take many,
<br>
many non-paleo supplements and medicines myself, but the &quot;base&quot; of my diet
<br>
is paleolithic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6.  I agree totally with the part about ancient lean meats being much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthier than the fatty meats we produce today. That is part of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason I am vegetarian, and part of the reason I don't eat a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meat to duplicate the Paleo diet. Modern meat is dangerous, fatty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. I have a list of about 20 sources of natural range-fed and wild game
<br>
meats and eggs that ship by mail-order. Let me know if you would like it.
<br>
Range-fed and wild game meat is much leaner, with the proper balances of
<br>
important fats like omega-3 and 6, whereas farm-fed beef is overly fat and
<br>
overly rich in omega-6 from the high omega-6 non-paleo corn upon which it is
<br>
raised.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 7.  As for the idea that we are &quot;adapted&quot; to the Paleo diet, I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a lot of confusion as to what &quot;adaptation&quot; is.  It rarely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involves mutations or genetic changes of thousands of years as most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people think. Adaptation occurs in one or two generations when all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those not adapted to survive die off, and only the survivors have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offspring into the next generation.  We have had dairy, tofu, grains, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bread, and agriculture for thousands of years.  Anybody not well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapted to these diets died of millennia ago.  I am not sure why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody would think that a modern person today would be well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapted to a diet that disappeared so long ago. 
</em><br>
<p>Consider for example that most of the world is lactose intolerant because
<br>
most of the world has not yet adapted to dairy. Milk is consumed mostly by
<br>
people of European descent, because dairy originated in Europe and the
<br>
majority of people of European descent have adapted to it, but lactose
<br>
intolerance is still a significant problem even among people of European
<br>
descent! 
<br>
<p>Gluten from wheat is also big problem for a lot of people. And I've already
<br>
mentioned lectins from grains, dairy and yeast. More evidence is that many
<br>
people have problems with casein (dairy protein). Casein is the most
<br>
difficult to digest of all types of protein. 
<br>
<p>While some people can eat practically anything, there is plenty of evidence
<br>
that we are not yet as whole adapted to a non-paleo diet.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 8. Even if the Paleo Diet were the perfect diet we are adapted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards, there is a big question as to what that adaptation is set to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximize. Evolutionary pressures do not push for longevity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is why I am always open to improvements on the paleodiet, and why
<br>
my personal diet includes many non-paleolithic substances. I agree
<br>
completely with mez in this thread, who pointed out that in prehistoric
<br>
times the forces of natural selection would have been blind to many of the
<br>
modern diseases of aging. The difference between my point of view and that
<br>
of others here (perhaps also yours) is that I believe the burden of proof is
<br>
on those who would ask us to add or subtract something from the paleodiet.
<br>
They need to show me the evidence that doing so is beneficial. In many cases
<br>
they have done so. I take for example 2500 mg of vitamin C each day. I've
<br>
never calculated it, but I would guess 2500 of C is probably as much or more
<br>
C than our prehistoric ancestors consumed in a month.
