<em>&gt; (Hal Finney &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Trusted%20Computing%20(was%20Bad%20ideas...)">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand why my reading of the technology's properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and capabilities is so different from everyone else's.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible that there are non-public documents which paint a much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sinister picture.  All I can say is that based on the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, TC works as I have described it here.
</em><br>
<p>First of all, thank you, Hal, for explaining your understanding of
<br>
this technology and standing up for your perception of it against
<br>
vocal opposition.  There aren't many people whose knowledge and
<br>
experience on computer matters I admire enough that I am forced to
<br>
rethink my own positions in light of theirs; you are one of them.
<br>
Harvey Newstrom is probably the only other.
<br>
<p>Today, David Rocci was convicted and sentenced to five months in
<br>
jail and a hefty fine for selling Xbox mod chips, which are used to
<br>
circumvent the encryption technology that makes them only run
<br>
approved games.  You need such a chip to install Linux on your
<br>
Xbox, for example.  This is exactly the kind of world I fear, where
<br>
laws intended &quot;to promote the progress of science and the useful
<br>
arts&quot; are in fact used to physically seize and imprison prople for
<br>
inventing and selling a device that makes the hardware you paid for
<br>
more useful.  This action, and others like it (such as the arrest of
<br>
Dmitri Sklyarov) are utterly unconcionable in a free society, and
<br>
will ultimately retard the very progress they claim to promote.
<br>
<p>My question is simple: how will TC technology fit into a world
<br>
alongside what I consider to be basic, fundamental human rights:
<br>
namely, the right to use, modify, combine, destroy, and otherwise
<br>
tinker with anything you own and any knowledge in your head for
<br>
any purpose you desire?
<br>
<p>In the examples you've given, trusted machines send encrypted IDs
<br>
and hashes of code back to servers.  What would prevent someone
<br>
from building a machine to falsify those reports so that he could
<br>
run something the third party didn't want him to (but presumably
<br>
legally acquired)?  Nothing technical that I can see; even if they
<br>
took the strongest precautions (which it doesn't appear they are),
<br>
it might still involve only cracking some encryption, which is
<br>
certainly feasible.  The only thing to prevent this, then, is law.
<br>
Force.  TC will be utterly useless without laws to enforce the idea
<br>
that a creator of content has the right to control what you can do
<br>
with /your/ legally-purchased machine and /your/ legally-acquired
<br>
information, just because he's the one who found or created that
<br>
information first. 
<br>
<p>Sure, there are probably some useful things enabled by TC.  But if
<br>
they require abandoning basic human rights, they're not worth it.
<br>
As they say, Mussolini made the trains run on time.  OK, so TCPA
<br>
might get me more music or movies than I might otherwise.  But if
<br>
the price is paying tribute to Disney for the privilege to show
<br>
my movie on my machine only on /their/ terms, I'll pass.
<br>
