<p>Yes. And there might be other ways which we do not currently
<br>
recognize - human-computer interaction tools enabling
<br>
EarthWebs, quantum computing and other entanglement stuff and
<br>
so on. Of course, singularities are likely not caused by one
<br>
technology. They are a sum of a whole economy accelerating, and
<br>
will likely be composed of a mix of advanced technologies. 
<br>
<p>Maybe one can formulate a question along these lines: given a
<br>
definition of singularity (like intelligence amplification
<br>
making cumulative change into a very tight feedback loop), what
<br>
physical laws and technologies can enable singularities? Can
<br>
there be worlds where technological intelligent life is
<br>
possible but singularities cannot occur?

</em><br>
<p>The universe in the story has one of the best thought out magic physics
<br>
I have ever seen; it has new fundamental forces (trinal paravection,
<br>
reticutriation, linovection), a trinary electric charge, a very complex
<br>
periodic system and some fun physical phenomena (dust is weightless,
<br>
large objects fall faster, the large scale distribution of matter is a
<br>
Sierpinsky gasket of flat triangular worlds, the air regularly
<br>
crystalises...). Dr. Alchemist has plenty of physics to explain
<br>
(<a href="http://www.unicornjelly.com/alt83.html">http://www.unicornjelly.com/alt83.html</a>)
<br>
<p>This is the kind of universe creation I will spend my time on when I get 
<br>
the chance. Just look at the wonderful biology: 
<br>

<br>
<p>Spoilers:
<br>
<p><p><p><p>In the story the near-singularity was largely due to a single
<br>
superintelligent individual (caused by an inadvertent symbiosis
<br>
between a human and a crystaline creature) who began to use two
<br>
local sentient species as ready-made nanoassemblers and
<br>
morphing &quot;AI&quot;. While the story did not lead to anything like a
<br>
Vingean singularity, it is notable that in the epilogue there
<br>
are both an enhanced character and a computer based on the
<br>
symbiosis. So in the story universe one could imagine a
<br>
singularity based on crystal-based intelligence amplification
<br>
and mind linkage through crystal-jelly interfaces (with some
<br>
hints of a atemporal communication a la &quot;Exordium&quot; in Alastair
<br>
Reynold's _Redemption Ark_).
<br>
<p>What I like the most about the story is that it creates a very 
<br>
non-static fantasy universe. There is technological progress, 
<br>
and species do evolve.
