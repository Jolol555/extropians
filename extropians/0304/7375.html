<p>
The only antivirals that I'm familiar with are Zicam
<br>
(zinc gluconate gel) and Sambucol (black elderberry
<br>
extract).  Both of them work fairly well, in my
<br>
experience.  Zicam, for me, will reliably knock back a
<br>
cold in a couple of days.  Sambucol will prevent me
<br>
getting the cold or flu to begin with.  I know, as one
<br>
winter I had a huge supply on hand that I found thrown
<br>
out from some nutritional supply house.  Even
<br>
out-of-date by a year or two, it still prevented me
<br>
from getting a single cold all winter, even while all
<br>
my co-workers were sneezing and coughing their guts
<br>
out.  Usually I get every cold that passes within a
<br>
mile.
<br>
<p>My immune system is screwy, due to family genetics,
<br>
not HIV. (Everybody in my family lives to a ripe old
<br>
age miserably.)  I get allergies - especially hay
<br>
fever, altho out here in S. CA it's only for a few
<br>
days a year, as compared ALL THE TIME in S. Carolina. 
<br>
AND, my immune system doesn't respond quickly enough
<br>
in many cases to infections.  So, for years I used
<br>
isoprinosine from Mexico.  Unfortunately, 9/11
<br>
aftermath makes me leary of trying to bring anything
<br>
back accross now, and I hate to waste $300 and a day
<br>
for nothing if they confiscate.
<br>
<p>I didn't notice that the isoprinosine did anything for
<br>
colds or flu, although it was effective in stopping
<br>
the cycle of low-level bronchitus to strep throat that
<br>
I used to stuck on.  Might be a useful adjunct to
<br>
other treatments targetting the virus with SARS.
<br>
<p>Any other suggestions?
