<p><em>&gt; An example of inconsistency is the assertion that God predates all

</em><br>
<p>You make good points but allow me to kick the tires of a few of 
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>If God were an SAI who seeded this universe within or outside of 
<br>
a VR then there is no reason God could not contain lots of 
<br>
dynamic structure while predating the existence within and 
<br>
perhaps transcending the physics of this particular space/time 
<br>
bubble.  Nothing that exist can predate existence itself as that 
<br>
would be a contradiction.  But all of existence does not have to 
<br>
obey the rules of this particular space-time universe.
<br>
<p>On the emotion thing, I presume you are talking about the rants 
<br>
attributed to Yahweh/Jehovah and the going-on of some of the 
<br>
gods and goddesses by other religions around the world?  Well, 
<br>
it is a constructed explanation but there is one beyond myth 
<br>
(which is probably most of it) that is possible.  That is that 
<br>
some of these tales are about trans/post-humans of another era 
<br>
and/or species who lorded it over our ancestors.  Some of these 
<br>
tales could be morality plays about what could come of/from some 
<br>
of us in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The simplest explanation for memes containing such assertions is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are the confabulations of storytellers who lacked the scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge and investigative mindset to detect the inconsistencies in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own stories, and simply made stuff up that sounded good to them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while transparently ridiculous from the view of later centuries. 
</em><br>
<p>The problem with that explanation is that the human mental 
<br>
capability hasn't changed a whole lot in thousands of years. 
<br>
These folks were every bit as capable of detecting the 
<br>
inconsistencies as we are. So what was a sufficient driver to 
<br>
keep repeating the same inconsistent myths/doctrines/dogma? 
<br>
There is no basis for beleiving they were so dumb.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptually possible that despite such storytelling having a clear and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consilient explanation as fiction, there is nonetheless some even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler explanation under which it is true.  But I am not holding my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breath.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Intersection between a trans/post-human group and our species 
<br>
somewhere back in history is one consistent alternative.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Similarly, the successive theological rationalization of such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confabulations farther and farther away from the original unpalatable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictions has produced a great deal of extremely vague spirituality.  
</em><br>
<p>If we did intersect with transhumans in the past, it would be 
<br>
very likely that very garbled versions of what actually 
<br>
occurred, greatly inflated over time, would result.
<br>
<p>Spirituality is not vague but I will admit as a participant and 
<br>
explorer of it that it can be dangerous.  It is not so easy to 
<br>
keep grounded when wading into it.  Much has been build up on 
<br>
what I will oversimplify as &quot;believe/project then fake it until 
<br>
you make it&quot;.  Perhaps that can be more charitably stated as 
<br>
&quot;project what you wish were true and backfill to show it is true 
<br>
or make it true&quot; - in short idealized rationalization or 
<br>
magicking reality into the shape of the ideal.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I myself go through cycles where spirituality makes 
<br>
great and perfect sence alternating with spirituality seeming 
<br>
like an understandable but doomed and fruitless grand pipe dream 
<br>
at best.  Currently I am in the latter state.  Ask me again when 
<br>
I am in the former, if the cycle continues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This vague spirituality allows people with moderate levels of scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literacy to deceive themselves without believing things so blatantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous that they would lose their self-respect.  But such defensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalization is not any more likely to be correct, nor will the new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictions produced be able to fool anyone with a higher level of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific knowledge or less eagerness to be deceived.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Defensive rationalization?  OK, perhaps so.  But I am not always 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;convinced this is the case.
