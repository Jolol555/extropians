As I understand the proposed implementation, only MS signed &amp; approved 
<br>
software would be allowed to run, although there was talk that the first 
<br>
versions would allow you to bypass the restriction after reading a 
<br>
warning.  This might or might not include programs that you had written 
<br>
yourself.  Perhaps programs created on your computer wouldn't trigger 
<br>
the flag.  (This is certainly technically possible, but I don't know 
<br>
what the intention is.
<br>
<p>Entertainment console isn't a bad description.  Many have held the X box 
<br>
up as the current prototype for the new MS environment.  They probably 
<br>
don't have any inside information, but one can't be sure.  But with MS 
<br>
working toward &quot;Web Services&quot;, they may not even envision you storing 
<br>
the files that you create on your local disk.  (They already seem to be 
<br>
claiming ownership of all documents produced with their 
<br>
software...though I'm not sure as IANAL -- and since I long ago decided 
<br>
not to agree to their EULAs, I can only read what others post about 
<br>
them.  But they were already bad enough.)  So it looks like the target 
<br>
environment that they are aiming for has all data stored remotely, and 
<br>
processed by programs that reside on remote servers.  Possily the 
<br>
computation will also be done remotely.  The services would be 
<br>
subscription based, and under total control of MS.  Sort of like the old 
<br>
time-share computer setup that mainframes used to use.  In that light, 
<br>
what they would be leasing (not selling) would be a fancy access 
<br>
terminal to which you had strictly limited rights.  It's a model that's 
<br>
worked before.
