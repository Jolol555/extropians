<em>&gt; As I somehow imagine it, I would know an angel or God simply by the sheer physical majesty (intense glow, levitating, telepathy, overwhelming presence) and overall supernatural &quot;vibe.&quot;  You would not need any tests done, you would instantly know.

<p>There is a bit of a problem with that.  Given a suitable set of 
<br>
attitudes/conditionings it is not difficult to kick off the 
<br>
experience of a divine presence and energy about a being real or 
<br>
imagined.  Cults and guru figures do this all the time whether 
<br>
or not the guru is really highly advanced spiritually or not.  A 
<br>
relatively advanced being or even a decent hynotist could 
<br>
probably manipulate you into an experience of considerable 
<br>
spiritual awe.  But would that mean that the experience 
<br>
corresponded to some reality, that it was a sign of being in the 
<br>
presence of the Divine?
<br>
<p>When I or others experience these grand unitive states and being 
<br>
overwhelmed spiritually it is not clear where the line is 
<br>
between internal brain states and something actually existing 
<br>
that is being apprehended.
<br>
<p>I like the story I read about Krishnamurti doing an experiment. 
<br>
He went out to the field and picked up a perfectly ordinary 
<br>
smooth medium sized stone.  He brought it home, placed it on an 
<br>
altar, and every day for a month came and made offerings to it, 
<br>
rubbed it with oil, and worshipped in front of it.  By the end 
<br>
of that month he was pretty convinced that rock was indeed full 
<br>
of spiritual power and very holy.
