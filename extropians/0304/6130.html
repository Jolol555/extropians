<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;What is germane to this discussion is which kind of life is more of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;or I'd call the more modern structures are ESS's.  That is one reason

<em>&gt;&gt;Possibly.  But throughout history areas with dense populations have not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;replaced, but depended on immigration.  And areas with low density 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;population have been net exporters of population.  This holds with many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;different social systems, cultures, limits to sanitation, etc.

<em>&gt;That's extremely interesting.  So a corollary would be that urban
</em><br>
<em>&gt;populations have a lower birth rate than rural populations.  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you know if this is indeed quite general?  Happen to know of any

<em>&gt;&gt;So there may be something more basic going on.

<em>&gt;It brings to mind the old theories about crowding (and group
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selection, which is an incorrect application of group selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by the way).

<em>&gt;&gt;It would be interesting to know the distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;China's population replacement ratios.  But from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;what I've heard [newspaper factoids] it's again
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the country population that is growing and the city
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;population that is declining.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
This is another one of those things I ran across decades ago, so you'd 
<br>
have to dig up references yourself.  Originally, though, the attribution 
<br>
was to diseases, or poisoning or.... well, lots of things.  The first 
<br>
time I heard someone suppose that it was crowding itself was in a 
<br>
Scientific American article on rats and mothering instincts in crowded 
<br>
environments.  That was probably in the 1970's.  I've never seen a good 
<br>
study that claimed the results on rats could be generalized, though many 
<br>
people have suggested it in a non-scientific context.  (I believe it was 
<br>
the basis of a fact article and a couple of stories in Analog Science 
<br>
Fact-&gt;Fiction.  No date even to the decade for that though.)
<br>
<p>The first time I ran across it was in reference to the Romans, and 
<br>
people were blaming lead water pipes.  Seems a bit unlikely as only the 
<br>
aristocrats had the lead pipes.  OTOH, having crazy aristocrats running 
<br>
things made life in the big city ... exciting.
