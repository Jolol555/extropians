<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That's a pretty bizarre idea, spike, but at the moment I

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't invent this notion.  The idea is an outgrowth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; theories presented in Geoffrey Miller's excellent work

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Mating Mind.

<em>&gt;It seems like a pretty strange idea that the neo-cortex would have evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just to fill up space in a newly oversized skull. There'd have to be simpler
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ways to do that (like some spac-filler). The brain is a bit complex, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all. It seems like a silly idea to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have this weird notion that intelligence turned out to be a massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competitive advantage, especially long term in making the organism more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adaptable. It seems to me that everything about humans is tuned to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;service of a general intelligence; fingers instead of claws, a mouth evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for speaking rather than devouring; a body which can travel pretty much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anywhere, while being pretty mediocre in any terrain; no fur, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clothing is more immediately adaptable. The human form is a jack of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trades, master of none; it just has to be minimally proficient in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conceivable arena, and let the extraordinary mind think of ways to overcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lack of specific physical competitiveness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm just making that up, but it's always seemed obvious to me (often an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indicator of being wrong). So is it wrong?
</em><br>

<p>Though I agree with you about the advantages of general intelligence, I 
<br>
think that there are at least a few things ways that we have adapted that 
<br>
help us use it.  First, our eyes are better than those of any animal I can 
<br>
think of.  Sure, some birds of prey can discern movement at a greater 
<br>
distance, but I believe that they don't have color vision.  It seems to me 
<br>
that sight and touch provide the most useful information for the purpose 
<br>
intelligently manipulating the world, and I would guess that our lack of 
<br>
hair is a great advantage to touch as well.
<br>
<p>Our second advantage is bipedal locomotion.  In addition to keeping our 
<br>
head up high to use our long range eyesight and keeping our hands free, it 
<br>
is more efficient than quadrupedal locomotion.  I've heard that, though 
<br>
humans can't keep up with most animals over a short distances, we can 
<br>
travel distances over 200 miles faster than any other land animal.  Of 
<br>
course, being able to sweat, unlike most animals, probably has a lot to do 
<br>
with that as well.
<br>
<p><p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
