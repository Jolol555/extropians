</em><br>
<p>Hard to say -- I'm not that familiar with either the AD or PD literature
<br>
(once I knew a bit more but that has long since fallen out of my brain).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Recently it turned out that APP has a direct toxic effect on mitochondria,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I could see some strange protein aggregation function clogging up the
<br>
mitochondrial transport proteins -- APP is only a few dozen amino acids
<br>
I think.  The mitochondrial transport proteins have to have pretty darn
<br>
large pore sizes to get all of the mito proteins inside.
<br>
<p>If that is the case -- or some other process degrades mitochondrial
<br>
function then it seems likely that one will get either a shortage
<br>
of ATP (that's bad for protein synthesis *and* breakdown) or perhaps
<br>
the production of more free radicals (though improper protein function)
<br>
producing more double strand breaks leading to the production of
<br>
nuclear proteins that will not fold properly leading to the &quot;wasteful&quot;
<br>
use of ATP (I call this the &quot;Energy Catastrophe Theory of Aging&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, are protein aggregates in AD and PD really lysosomal, or cytoplasmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or even extracellular)?
</em><br>
<p>A think APP starts out cytoplasmic but is supposed to get exported to to
<br>
the cell membrane or even outside the cell but a lot can happen to mutant
<br>
proteins on the way to the forum.  E.g. if the mutation is in part of the
<br>
signal sequence controlling transport and ultimate destination things
<br>
could get really screwed up. [I think I've heard George Martin state that
<br>
there is a polymorphism in the signal sequence (not perhaps a &quot;mutation&quot;
<br>
per se) of the Werner's Syndrome protein -- that might have a very
<br>
interesting effects by impacting the rate of transport of the newly
<br>
synthesized protein into the nucleus and therefore the quantity available
<br>
impacting the rates of DNA copying, transcription, etc. (it isn't fully
<br>
clear I think exactly when and where the WS protein is functioning) and
<br>
further downstream the overall &quot;rate&quot; of aging.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Atheromas are not aggregates of lysosomally indigestible material, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving cellular digestion is not likely to be of help.
</em><br>
<p>I did not mean to imply that it would help in *all* situations.  I believe
<br>
that &quot;aging&quot; is only going to fall by &quot;divide and conquer&quot;.
<br>
<p>What is an Atheroma?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there any indication that lipofuscin is indeed causally involved in cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure it is &quot;cell death&quot; -- sufficient #'s of double strand breaks
<br>
will activate the apoptosis progam (and human cells are a lot less tolerant
<br>
of double strand breaks than mouse cells -- perhaps a major reason they
<br>
get cancer sooner even though they have many fewer cells).
<br>
<p>Cell death *is* part of the process -- those cells that decide to undergo
<br>
apoptosis had better be replaced by stem cells -- otherwise you are just
<br>
going to fade away.  I suspect there is a delicate balance between
<br>
underactive stem cells -- so you don't heal as fast, gradually lose
<br>
functional capacity, etc. and overactive stem cells -- potentially
<br>
posed to turn into various forms of cancer.
<br>
<p>The data, for at least many cell types, I believe suggests that lipofuscin
<br>
accumulates with age -- thus the recycling ability of lysosomes containing
<br>
lipofuscin (or perhaps cytoplasmic lipofuscin) presumably declines and the
<br>
cells may compensate by making more lysosomes -- thus the cells fill up
<br>
with lysosomes containing lipofuscin (or perhaps merely lipofuscin
<br>
itself).  This is supported by the fact that the cells effectively lose
<br>
water content with age (more lipofuscin, more lysosomes = less water).
<br>
So if the cells are filling up with lipofuscin/lysosomes there is less and
<br>
less space for the mitochondria that you need to generate the energy the
<br>
cell requires -- thus &quot;Energy Catastrophe&quot;.  The increasing density of the
<br>
cell probably also slows down transport processes to the cell surface
<br>
and/or protein export.  That certainly has to have some negative
<br>
consequences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, I agree that the best way of fighting aging is reversing it by genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering (once you get it to work). I like your idea of transferring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mtDNA-encoded function to the nucleus. Any more information on this project?
</em><br>
<p>First you have to get genetic engineering *cheap* and *fast) (that I'm
<br>
reasonably sure I know how to do) -- *then* everyone can easily tinker
<br>
with various genomes to get it to &quot;work&quot;.
<br>
<p>I had the mtDNA-transfer to the nucleus idea probably 7-8 years ago. I
<br>
don't remember whether I came up with it. It may have come from a
<br>
theoretical paper that I read.  Aubrey de Grey I think figured it out
<br>
independently and has worked on it a bit more and I think he thinks its a
<br>
bit tricky because the human mtDNA proteins that are currently still in
<br>
the mtDNA are a bit hydrophobic and so transport and getting them across
<br>
the membranes may be difficult.
<br>
<p>I think he has some possible work-arounds -- do a PubMed search for his
<br>
papers over the last 3-4 years or send him an email.
<br>
<p>But the nucleus being a safer place than the mitochondria may be why
<br>
humans such a small mt Genome -- someone (perhaps *you*?) needs to write a
<br>
paper comparing the human, elephant and whale (bowhead or blue) mtDNA to
<br>
each other to see if they &quot;solved&quot; this problem the same way.  If we all
<br>
have small mtDNA then one could make a strong assertion that this is one
<br>
of the problems that has to be solved for a long lifespan!  The divergence
<br>
of humans from elephants and whales were something like 100+ and perhaps
<br>
80 million years ago respectively.  It seems likely the longevity
<br>
problem has been solved multiple times independently. [If you need the
<br>
refs on this I just semi-finished organizing them yesterday.  I'm trying
<br>
to see if I can push Steve Austad and Maynard Olsen into preparing a white
<br>
paper for sequencing these genomes so we can do comparative genomic
<br>
analysis -- but the sequencing of mtDNA genomes (if they aren't already
<br>
done as part of the phylogenetic work) would be much easier than a $50
<br>
million &quot;sell&quot; for elephants and whales (each).  $50 mil seems to be the
<br>
going price for the cow genome.]
<br>
<p>Alternate ideas I've thought of is intracellular bacteria engineered
<br>
to produce the modified mtProteins or even souped up to produce and
<br>
export ATP in high volumes (essentially recreating the mitochondria
<br>
with lesser free radical generation properties).  An alternate
<br>
process might be more robust mtDNA repair -- right now its pretty
<br>
minimal compared to the nucleus (something like 120+ nuclear DNA
<br>
repair proteins).
<br>
<p>The short summary is that there are a number of ways to tackle
<br>
this problem.  The pain in the rear end problem that we really
<br>
need to solve is what the heck in the mitochondrial transport
<br>
chain is generating the free radicals in the first place.
<br>
Every time I hear a talk on this topic it gives me a headache
<br>
due to the complexity.
