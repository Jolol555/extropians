founded on.  I deeply abhor the cancerous growth that dares to posture as the

<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that you have put your finger on one of the fundamental 
<br>
problems of being human.  I am saying that in the specific context of the 
<br>
Iraqi conflict.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, as human beings, are individuals.  We are born alone and we die 
<br>
alone.  In between we spend a lot of time alone.  We are taught and we learn 
<br>
to have standards.  If you please, we learn to erect a pole star as a guide 
<br>
to our conduct.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, ideally, we are conceived in the love of two people and are 
<br>
nurtured for nine months by a mother loved and supported by a father.  We are 
<br>
raised as a member of a family, a community and a nation.  If we are 
<br>
fortunate, while still fairly young, we learn that we are members of the 
<br>
family of man.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the basic dichotomy of our existence is that we are 
<br>
individuals and members of a society.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like you, if my memory serves me well, I am a libertarian with a small 
<br>
ell.  As such I am an individualist.  But I have also learned long ago that I 
<br>
can board a jetliner and fly anywhere in the world.  When we land and 
<br>
disembark they will not call me a part blood Indian, nor will they identify 
<br>
me by the nationality of any of my white ancestors -- they will simply call 
<br>
me an American.  If they do not like Americans they will assail me as such 
<br>
regardless of my particular feelings.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the immediate situation I have lurked on a middle eastern site, 
<br>
discussed international affairs with friends from the middle east, and 
<br>
listened to the ranting against the Jews and the Americans by coworkers (on 
<br>
the job) from the middle east far too many times over too long a time to 
<br>
believe the present difficulty is caused by anything more than the aggressive 
<br>
intent against Americans by middle easterners.  Samantha, you may come to a 
<br>
different conclusion but that is mine.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I excusing all conduct by my own country?  No, of course not.  
<br>
Sometimes we anger people by actually doing something wrong.  Often we are 
<br>
blamed as wrong because two countries having different goals desire mutually 
<br>
exclusive help from us.  As an example, how could we do as the middle 
<br>
easterners want &amp; help them slaughter the Israelis?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess in the end, life and our opponents sometimes force us to make 
<br>
the Robert E. Lee decision.  We don't have the luxury of not choosing sides.  
<br>
So, we pick the best of a less than ideal choice.  In my own case the choice 
<br>
between Sadaam and the US was relatively very easy.
<br>
Ron h.
