</em><br>
<p>Right.  This is the prime example of my contention that what will work
<br>
best against aging is reversal of accumulated damage, rather than any
<br>
attempt to pre-empt the formation of that damage by messing about with
<br>
bioactive molecules.  See various of my recent publications.

<p><em>&gt; It's strange, though, that up-regulation of endogenous anti-oxidants

</em><br>
<em>&gt; one mouse model where the organisms have been genetically engineered
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifespan, and greater resistance to stress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the mouse model, the catalase is specifically targeted to the

</em><br>
<p>I confess I was extremely surprised at the mitochondrial catalase result
<br>
-- not least because it seems to go against the argument that Robert
<br>
gives above and with which I agree.  I'm less concerned about successes
<br>
in flies and worms, because there the rate of free radical production is
<br>
really high and the pathways involved in translating this into aging
<br>
are probably a lot more simple and direct, more important than subtle
<br>
signalling stuff.  My reading of the mitochondrial catalase result is
<br>
that this is a (rare, in mammals) similar case, where one is modulating
<br>
something that has so direct an effect on aging that the signalling
<br>
issue is somehow sidestepped (very much as Robert wrote in his second
<br>
post).  But beware -- it may only work in lab mice, as CR seems to.
