<p><p>This is exactly like the Zone Diet by Dr. Barry Sears.
<br>
<p>The idea is pretty simple. Keep the level of blood sugar inside the 
<br>
zone. The zone is where the blood sugar is low enough that you don't 
<br>
produce insuline, and high enough that you are not to hungry.
<br>
<p>Sugar, white bread, pasta, rice etc. should be avoided. They get 
<br>
absorbed to quickly in the blood stream and raises the insuline level. 
<br>
Carbs should come from vegetables, coarse bread and some fruits.
<br>
<p>30% energy from fat
<br>
30% energy from proteins
<br>
40% energy from carbohydrates.
<br>
<p>This is a little different combination of macronutrients than what is 
<br>
normally recommended. There is more protein and less carbs.
<br>
<p>I have lived by this diet for about a year. And it works nicely. I am 
<br>
drinking to much coke and eating to much sweets. But I can still keep my 
<br>
weight down by running 2-3 times a week, for an hour each time.
<br>
<p>I had a longer period where I exercised 1 hour every week day (running 
<br>
and bycycling.) In that period I lost 1 Kg a week without taking any 
<br>
special care with my diet.
<br>
<p>So my general rule of thumb, as to what I eat in every meal, is a piece 
<br>
of lean meat about the size and thicknes of my palm, and as many 
<br>
vegetables and coarse bread i care to eat. Most often I make a sandwich 
<br>
with home baked buns, mixed salad and a lot of lean meat.
<br>
<p>This is an easy diet ;-)
<br>
<p>I am pretty shure that I would loose weight if I skipped some of the 
<br>
cake and chocolate. But why bother ;-9
