<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Who thinks that we should &quot;choose something nutritionally sound, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; a cheeseburger with a slice of tomato and lettuce leaf&quot;? Vegetarians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and health faddists would avoid the meat.  Atkins dieters would avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the bread. Paleo dieters would avoid the cheese.  I am really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; curious. Which diet actually promotes cheeseburgers as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;nutritionally sound&quot;? -- Harvey Newstrom, CISSP, IAM, GSEC, IBMCP
</em><br>
<p><p>Don't quote me on this, but i think Dr. Bob Arnots guidelines (I think he
<br>
provides that, rather than a &quot;diet&quot;) would allow it, provided that with the
<br>
Cheeseburger you ate beans or veggies rather than fries. The beans would
<br>
provide protein &amp; fiber and soak up the cheeseburger nastiness, letting it
<br>
all take longer to get through ya. Cheesburger + fries = evil!
<br>
<p>I think the whole point of diets is to be able to eat a cheeseburger
<br>
*occasionally* so that you do not have to live in some bizarre starvation
<br>
world. I make my own cheeseburgers sometimes and they are tastyy and pretty
<br>
healthy. Cheeseburgers really vary in nastiness factor, some are ~400
<br>
calories and sorta low in fat and others 800 calories and lots of fat. I
<br>
rarely eat fast food though, because they are soooooo bad in so many ways,
<br>
it is hard to even find any real food at them, everything is 45% fat and
<br>
carbs, it is almost incomprehensible. Ironicaly, I find that i can now go to
<br>
McD's and buy their little dollar burgers when I am in a hurry and need
<br>
something fast, $1 + tax gets a nice little burger, I feel like I am getting
<br>
over on them and their $5.00 meals. I do not know how people can get a meal
<br>
deal, I would pass out afterwards.
<br>
<p>While I am shit talking here, it is difficult to eat well in America these
<br>
days, I go to 7/11's or gas station mini marts to get a munchie and they got
<br>
candy and carbs. Even those energy bars are often a scam, costing $2.00 and
<br>
having high carbos for a runner! They often have some nuts, which are pretty
<br>
tasty and good for ya, depending, and sandwhiches/sushi/burritos, which
<br>
while not perfect, are as close as I can find to real food. Bizarre how it
<br>
goes, I and many other people should pay with their pocketbook for good
<br>
food, but somehow it does not work that way.
<br>
<p>My own belief is that deli sandwiches are near the perfect diet. A sandwich
<br>
has all the food groups, lots of protein (depending on who makes it and what
<br>
ya order), meat, dairy, carbs, lettuce, tomato, etc. I often buy a big
<br>
sandwich on a french roll for lunch, eat half, and eat the other half for
<br>
dinner. For me, volume is important, the portions are too big almost
<br>
everywhere! We get too good a deal here in America. Cook up some vegetables
<br>
at home or get some with the sandwich and I got a pretty good meal. Most
<br>
importanly, sandwiches taste great and are satisfying. Support your local
<br>
deli, not your local fast food!
