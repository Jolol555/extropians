Lee Crocker writes about &quot;voluntary&quot; restrictions on information distribution:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is really the core of the issue, and it's a very hard question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a libertarian, certainly the knee-jerk response should be to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more choices. But I think the choices here are illusory. One cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate the rights to use content from the content itself. A movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I can view once on one machine is a very different product from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a movie that I own and can view anywhere, any time, and analyze, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take clips from, etc.  But the truth is that even if I agree to buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only the former product, the latter one still exists for the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price for those people who have technology to break to lock--and there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always be such technology. It simply isn't physically possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fully control use of the content.
</em><br>
<p>That makes sense overall, but I would quibble about a couple of points.
<br>
First, the unrestricted version is not just available for the same
<br>
price; in your model, I believe it is available for free!  That makes
<br>
your argument even stronger in a way.  And second, this only applies to
<br>
&quot;static&quot; content like movies and music; dynamic content like software
<br>
cannot necessarily be captured so easily.  We might see interactive 3-D
<br>
movies in the future, where being able to view it is not the same as
<br>
being able to reproduce it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since I can assume that copying technology will exist, and that full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights-enabled content will be available to me whether I agree to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions or not, why would I agree to the restrictions? The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason would be if the /law/ prevented me from using the rights-enabled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content, as it might be argued that copyright law does (although even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, it's not clear; do the&quot;fair use&quot; provisions allow me to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clips to a film class even if I have to crack encryption to do so?)
</em><br>
<p>Again, this makes sense... but any argument which includes the phrase
<br>
&quot;the only reason would be...&quot; is inherently somewhat weak.  Can we really
<br>
be sure that is the *only* reason?  Given the vast possibilities for
<br>
human motivation and creativity, and the tremendous diversity of human
<br>
needs and desires, I think we need to be extremely hesitant to claim
<br>
that there can only be one possible motivation for an action.
<br>
<p>And I think your argument depends pretty crucially on this &quot;only reason&quot;
<br>
factor, as I'll discuss below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the only way for the rights-limited content to have any value is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the law to recognize the author's rights to restrict access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his creations, and for the many reasons I've outlined on this forum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and elsewhere, I don't support such laws. This technology legitimizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those laws: it makes the assumption that the author has the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control access to information made public, and provides a means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcing that assumption. But it wouldn't be valuable without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws behind it, and it's the laws I really object to.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I think this argument makes sense in its own terms: DRM only works
<br>
if there is the threat of force behind it, because otherwise people would
<br>
break the restrictions and get the data for free.  It is this use of
<br>
force to restrict information that you find evil, and since DRM relies
<br>
on force, it is inherently evil as well.
<br>
<p>But what happens if someone has other reasons for wanting to avoid the
<br>
unauthorized versions of data, and is willing to pay for the DRM version?
<br>
Maybe the content companies have started rumors that some of the
<br>
unauthorized versions carry viruses.  Maybe they even taint the pirate
<br>
nets with bogus versions of the data.  I think we've seen both of these
<br>
tactics already.  Going forward, it's possible that we will see a long
<br>
series of such measures applied by the content companies and designed
<br>
to destroy faith in the black market nets.  Someone who is convinced
<br>
of such dangers, justifiably or not, might prefer the perceived safety
<br>
and security of downloading the authorized version.  And in exchange,
<br>
they would be willing to accept the use of DRM software.
<br>
<p>Or maybe someone just doesn't think it is right to take a version for
<br>
free when the artist who worked hard to create it is begging people not to
<br>
&quot;steal&quot; their content and to buy from the authorized distributor.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that there are any number of reasons why people might be
<br>
willing to voluntarily accept the restrictions imposed by DRM, even when
<br>
the same content is available in unauthorized form without restrictions.
<br>
And if you accept this, then the argument doesn't work that DRM is evil
<br>
because it depends on the threat of force.
<br>
