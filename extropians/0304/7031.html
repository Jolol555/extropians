This is what I mean by &quot;burden-of-proof,&quot; in this case concerning the claims
<br>
of the dairy industry:
<br>
<p>THE DAIRY INDUSTRY ASKS THE QUESTION AND MAKES THE CLAIM:
<br>
<p>&quot;Got Milk? You need our milk and dairy products for strong teeth and bones.&quot;
<br>
<p>THE TYPICAL FAT AMERICAN CONSUMER REPLIES:
<br>
<p>&quot;Yeah, Mr. Dairy Farmer, I got milk! Of course I got it! Doesn't everyone
<br>
drink milk and eat other dairy products? Milk is as American as Baseball and
<br>
Apple Pie! What would I do without dairy? I soak my Fruit Loops in milk in
<br>
the morning, and at lunch I tell Ronald McDonald to plaster my hamburger
<br>
with slabs of fatty cheese, and at dinner I slather my foods with creamy
<br>
cheese sauces.  Besides, your other farmer pals tell me I need foods like
<br>
bread and potatoes and macaroni. I love starchy foods like bread and
<br>
potatoes and macaroni, but how am I supposed to eat these darned things as
<br>
they are? Someone please pass me more cheese and butter!&quot;
<br>
<p>THE PALEODIET THEORIST REPLIES:
<br>
<p>&quot;No, Mr. Dairy Farmer, I do not &quot;got milk.&quot; I see no reason that I should
<br>
consume your milk or dairy products. Your claim that I need milk for strong
<br>
teeth and bones appears false. The evidence is that my paleolithic ancestors
<br>
had longer, stronger bones and healthier teeth than my parents and
<br>
grandparents had at the same age, and yet those ancestors of mine were
<br>
hunter-gatherers who consumed essentially zero dairy products. This is
<br>
explained easily by evidence from nutritional science that green leafy
<br>
vegetables provide plenty of calcium for strong teeth and bones. Also the
<br>
calories from dairy come mostly from saturated fat and sugar, both of which
<br>
are likely to increase my probability of heart disease, diabetes and other
<br>
diseases. Many of my fellow humans cannot even tolerate milk sugar
<br>
(lactose), and many others have difficulty digesting milk protein (casein).
<br>
No doubt this is because homo sapiens as a whole is not well adapted to the
<br>
non-paleolithic substances in dairy products. The human genome
<br>
down-regulates production of lactase, the enzyme for metabolizing milk
<br>
sugar, in the first two years of life. Apparently my genes do not want or
<br>
expect your milk during my adulthood, especially the milk of another
<br>
species. No other species on earth consumes the milk of another species. I
<br>
note also that the country with the highest per capita incidence of diabetes
<br>
is also the country with the highest per capita consumption of dairy
<br>
(Finland). America is thoroughly soaked in the milk meme thanks to you and
<br>
the billions you've spent on advertising, Mr. Dairy Farmer, but this
<br>
American is not impressed. The burden of proof is on you to show me exactly
<br>
why I should add these foods to the diet upon which my species evolved.
<br>
Please show me how dairy products will increase my health or longevity.&quot;
<br>
<p>The dairy farmers are incapable of rising to the challenge. Instead they
<br>
plaster billboards and magazines with photographs of famous people sporting
<br>
milk mustaches.
