<p>I agree and with further advances in intelligence and precision guided

weapons systems direct retaliation against dictators might be a

valid alternative to war itself.

<p>One conclusion I can make which I think is quite accurate is that it
<br>
would be extropic to seek to make wars as technologically advanced as
<br>
possible. It seems that the more advanced the war, the fewer casualties
<br>
that occur, especially civilian casualties. The Congolese example is a
<br>
control point, demonstrating that lowtech war, even in the modern age,
<br>
is messy with lots of collateral damage.
<br>
<p>In the current Iraq war, coalition casualties are less than 100, and
<br>
while Iraqi military casualties are estimated at between 40,000 to as
<br>
much as 100,000, there are less than 700 civilian casualties, which is
<br>
quite amazing. I seem to recall Samantha claiming that civilian
<br>
casualties would be over 100,000. How would you like your crow, Sam?
<br>
<p>I would also say that the media embedding experience in this war is an
<br>
unqualfied success. I think the primary benefit of this experience is
<br>
that media coverage of units helped improve troop attitudes toward
<br>
minimizing civilian casualties and treating enemy wounded and prisoners
<br>
well. The way in which the Iraqi military treated both categories is a
<br>
sharp contrast, given that they had no embedded media.
<br>
<p>The focus on eliminating enemy leadership is also a departure from past
<br>
conflicts. In the past, it was seen as improper to target the officer
<br>
corps more closely than enlisted men, on the logic that the officers
<br>
were the only entities that kept the men behaving honorably and with
<br>
discipline. The problem with this war is that Iraqi officers were far
<br>
more likely to be forcing their men to behave dishonorably, with the
<br>
choice of being shot for refusing to do so.
<br>
<p>That the Iraqi military, fedayeen and other combatants have been so
<br>
significantly eliminated, with fewer than 6,000 enemy POWs to date,
<br>
reflects this. We simply could not tolerate dishonorable behavior by
<br>
enemy combatants, but also enemy combatants had no choice, they were
<br>
going to die either fighting us or by their commanders own hands.
<br>
<p>Future wars will be of two kinds, based on how lawfully the sides act. 
<br>
<p>One kind will have both sides behaving honorably, with weapons systems
<br>
designed to disable enemy weapons only. Combatant casualties will be in
<br>
the hundreds at most, and civilian casualties will be in the handful at
<br>
most. These sorts of wars I think will be few and far between, if at
<br>
all. If two sides are so willing to act honorably, they are far more
<br>
likely to resolve their problems diplomatically.
<br>
<p>The other kind will have a despotic regime throwing respect for the laws
<br>
of war out the window, threatening execution for soldiers who do not
<br>
suicide themselves, violating all Geneva Conventions, and torturing and
<br>
executing captured enemy prisoners. The opposing side will cause very
<br>
few civilian casualties, but will have no compunction about decimating
<br>
enemy formations and will target the leadership cadres that are acting
<br>
so dishonorably.
<br>
<p>As despotic regimes cease to exist, I think we will find a third kind
<br>
emerging, which might be tied in to Olympic-type contests of champions,
<br>
where points of conflict need to be resolved quickly but where diplomacy
<br>
has failed, and parties do not want a long dragged out trade war.
