<em>&gt;Yes, well, thanks anyway.  Like I said before, I'm trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to figure out the most plausible set of assumptions held
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by people who favor the existence of minimum-wage laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is the current set:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Here are my thoughts
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1. Higher minimum wage does not eliminate the existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   jobs due to advances in technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
What a job is worth is decided by power politics.  Technological 
<br>
innovations change the balance, and render some jobs obsolete while at 
<br>
the same time creating new jobs.  N.B.:  one of the currently more 
<br>
common innovations is &quot;de-skilling&quot; jobs, so that you can pay people 
<br>
less to do them.  Cf.: MacDonalds, et al.  No chef's need apply.  Or 
<br>
waiters.  (Some jobs are so de-skilled, that they are then delegated to 
<br>
the customer.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2. There is no supply and demand relationship affecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   value of worker efforts, (and hence their retainability).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
At any particular time, there exists a supply and demand for every 
<br>
particular set of job skills.  But if you aren't particularlly skilled 
<br>
at negotiating, then you won't come off as well.  So skilled negotiators 
<br>
can get work at HR jobs, and everyone else looses.  (Even management.  
<br>
The skill at negotiating doesn't extend to evaluating job skill.)
<br>
Thus there is no *simple* supply and demand relationship.
<br>
Retraining workers isn't necessarily to the benefit of the employer, but 
<br>
may be done anyway.  Managers get increased status from having more 
<br>
employees under them, so they will attempt to increase their number in 
<br>
many different ways.  And workers benefit from being employed, so they 
<br>
will attempt to continue to be employed whether it is to the benefit of 
<br>
their employer or not.  Small businesses are very different from large 
<br>
organizations here, and any model that covers both of them will need to 
<br>
be quite complex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3. Jobs are givens: in black and white terms, society needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to perform and will perform a job X, or it will not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
???  I don't find this clear at all.  Many jobs are make-work.  Many 
<br>
legally mandated jobs serve no necessary purpose, but it does get the 
<br>
forms filled out.  And many necessary jobs aren't funded by anyone.  
<br>
E.g., in the downtown areas of many cities the outsides of the buildings 
<br>
are dirty, and there is litter in the streets.  (Well, OK, necessary is 
<br>
to strong a word for that.)  Hospital emergency rooms are often very 
<br>
understaffed.  Etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;4. Saving money, especially by the rich, has no salutary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   side-effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
What is money?  A bank is legally allowed to loan what?  3/2s as much 
<br>
money as it has on deposit?  Anyway, some fraction greater than one.  So 
<br>
if the rich were to deposit their money into a bank, they would increase 
<br>
the amount of money in circulation.  If they invest it in a 
<br>
manufacturing facility, then they are encouraging the manufacture of 
<br>
whatever they have invested in (and will probably take other measures to 
<br>
encourage it's success).  Perhaps if they invest it in land, and then 
<br>
hold the land undeveloped?  But in that case they are probably 
<br>
encouraging various species of wild animals to survive.
<br>
<p>I think that if they invest in anything beyond precious metals (i.e., 
<br>
bars of metal, not paper) that it will have numerous side effects.  Some 
<br>
are almost bound to be good.  And some won't be.  If a bank has more 
<br>
money to lend, is that good or bad?  Probably both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;5. The number of employers and number of jobs are fixed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
??  Neither is fixed.  Both vary wildly over time and with legal 
<br>
demands.  E.g., government regulations that encourage monopolies 
<br>
decrease the number of employers.  This, of course, depends on how 
<br>
employer is defined.  If each separate hiring unit is an employer, then 
<br>
the number is closer to being fixed (though still quite fluid).  And the 
<br>
number of jobs also varies wildly.  What people want *may* be fairly 
<br>
fixed, but what they can choose, and what they can afford varies wildly 
<br>
with government regulations and economic conditions (and of course, 
<br>
those aren't independant variables, but there's a long lag between them).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Do I favor minimum wage laws?  Yes/no.  I favor a linear tax rule with a 
<br>
baseline:   tax = rate * income - povertylevel
<br>
In this equation rate and poverty level are legally defined constants 
<br>
(i.e., they vary over time, but they are constant for individuals at any 
<br>
particular time).  And income should include all sources of cash.  No 
<br>
exceptions.  Thus if your rate * income is less than povertylevel, the 
<br>
government will pay you.  This isn't exactly a minimum wage, but it's 
<br>
what I favor instead.
<br>
However, given our current setup, I favor a minimum wage that will allow 
<br>
a person to live &quot;adequately&quot; on 40 hours a week work.  &quot;adequately&quot; is 
<br>
necessarily dependant on local cost of living factors.  If  a job will 
<br>
not allow a person to live, then it can't reasonably be called a job.
<br>
The trouble with the minimum-wage setup is that there is a sharp 
<br>
dicotomy between full support an no support, so many inhomogeneities and 
<br>
unfairnesses are inherrently designed into the system.  And it's set so 
<br>
low that nobody can live on it, so they do something else on the side.   
<br>
They have to.  Now counting transportation, I work 10 hours a day at my 
<br>
single job, so I certainly couldn't hold down two.
<br>
<p>The design of the system inherrently means that during periods of 
<br>
inflation the minimum wage will lag behind (as is what happened during 
<br>
the last 30 years).  By now it has lagged so far behind that is probably 
<br>
*does* do more harm than good.  As originally instituted, it was 
<br>
beneficial, but at that point it really did permit a person to live on 
<br>
the income from his job.
<br>
<p>Earlier this morning I was mentally comparing the tax structure, patent 
<br>
laws, copyrights, and social conditions with those of the 1950s.  We 
<br>
have gone drastically downhill.  The only gain (I admit it's a large 
<br>
one) that I noticed was increased interracial justice.  But there have 
<br>
been a tremendous number of very bad decisions made since then, and only 
<br>
a couple of them affect that area (and are thus &quot;justified&quot; by trying to 
<br>
find answers to hard questions).  E.g., one of the deleterious decisions 
<br>
made was that cities couldn't impose a residence requirement on those 
<br>
seeking assistance.  This meant that if one city were generous to those 
<br>
of it's citizens in need, people from all over the country would swamp 
<br>
it, and local taxes and infrastructure could not possibly pay to 
<br>
continue the services.  (This was a part of the cause of the &quot;Summer of 
<br>
Love&quot; that swamped San Francisco.  That was the event that turned 
<br>
&quot;Hippie&quot; into a perjoritive term for those who don't evaluate everything 
<br>
on a cash basis.  The natives were basically artists and craftsmen, the 
<br>
influx was basically freeloaders.  And there were so many that there was 
<br>
no possible way to support them [and, admittedly, little reason--they 
<br>
weren't the same people].)  But if there had been a residence 
<br>
requirement for assistance, as there had been until it was ruled 
<br>
illegal, this wouldn't have happened (or at least would have been quite 
<br>
brief).
