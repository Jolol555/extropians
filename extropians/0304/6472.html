</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is a significant difference between the two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just a terminology quibble: when not deployed for war, 'police'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions, or training, line troops are 'in garrison'. I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you mean by 'garrison troops'. 
</em><br>
<p>There are generally two types of conventional infantry troops: garrison
<br>
and line. Line troops are trained and equipped to take territory from
<br>
enemy combat units and engage in direct combat. Garrison troops are
<br>
trained to hold territory and maintain civil order in the absence or
<br>
scarcity of a civil constabulary. While line troops, when not in combat
<br>
are 'in garrison', they are not garrison troops, and trying to make
<br>
them into such ruins them for line combat use.
<br>
<p>You might have heard of a phenomenon called by the french legionnaires
<br>
'le cafard', the bug, which is a problem of discipline with line troops
<br>
who are not given action or exercise on a regular basis. Trying to turn
<br>
line troops into garrison troops makes such a problem inevitable.
<br>
<p>The US ground based military is, outside of base MP and logistical
<br>
personnel, generally trained for line work. In the last 20 years, the
<br>
US military has put a special emphasis on promulgating a 'warrior
<br>
ethic' and orienting troops toward line work. This is primarily active
<br>
duty units, while National Guard units are generally trained for the
<br>
equivalent of garrison work, since they are dual-use trained for
<br>
dealing with civil disturbances, natural disasters, etc.
<br>
<p>You've probably noticed that the US actions overseas have emphasised
<br>
work that could be generally categorized as 'line' work, while
<br>
contributions of other nations generally followed later, since other
<br>
nations generally only train their troops for the equivalent of
<br>
garrison work. The few exceptions are the special forces units each
<br>
nation posesses. 
<br>
<p>For example, in Afghanistan, there are now more Germans and Turks there
<br>
than Americans, and those German and Turkik units are garrison units,
<br>
training Afghans in western policing and national guard type work. The
<br>
US work there was primarily line work, and today the only US forces
<br>
there are primarily line units, especially special forces units.
