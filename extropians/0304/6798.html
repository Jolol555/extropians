assertion of what will actually happen, what the papers are &quot;selling&quot; to

people, or conclusions that people have reached independently?
<br>
<p>Robert,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an estimate published in the middle eastern papers I read 
<br>
(sorry I didn't keep the issue) from members of OPEC.  But the issue as I see 
<br>
it is that we need to get out of these debates and get some of the 
<br>
information that is so readily available.  Those newspapers in my opinion 
<br>
shed a lot of light on what is going on.
<br>
Ron h.
