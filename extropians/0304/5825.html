<em>&gt; &gt;Ron h.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did a few spreadsheet calculations, involving the current minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wage, the hours in a week, and the cost of rent in substandard housing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the area where I live.  Working full time at minimum wage, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without counting taxes
</em><br>
<p><p>### People living on minimum wages do not pay direct taxes.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
or any other expenses (e.g., food, clothes, etc.)
<br>
<em>&gt; a persons would end up with less than $7 per day after paying their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rent.  (I forget how much less, and I made several optomistic
</em><br>
assumptions.)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might want to think about that, when you are recommending that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum wage be lowered or removed.  Effectively, it already has been.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People can't avoid paying taxes, so they would actually end up in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole for paying their rent at the end of a month, even with no other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expenses at all.  (e.g., food, clothes, medicine.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now actually the way people live through this is by stuffing an illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of people into one apartment.  So this means that they are at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mercy of any authority who has it in for them, and since they are easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targets there are many who take advantage.  And I forgot to include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transportation.  Another necessity which must be paid, and can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afforded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your estimates and models are based on assuming that free choice is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available.  This is in contradiction to the observed facts.  If you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to know why a disporportionate number of low income people turn to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent crime, look at the above and consider that desperation might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved.  Or a reluctance to willingly sign themselves over to a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of slavery.  (Yes, it's a bad answer.  But desperation frequently yields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad answers.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yes, I know individuals who have escaped from the trap.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't alter the fact that for the majority, it is real, present, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearantly unavoidable.  If you strip hope from people, don't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised if they strip life or property from you.  It can be reliably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicted that this wouldn't help most of them much, but *you* wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be there to know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have never supposed that &quot;Homeland Security&quot; was mainly intended to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect us against foreigners.  I look at what they are doing, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observe who is mainly being observed, and I figure that where they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying attention is where they intend to act.  Most of the powers they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been granted have nothing to do with stopping foreign terrorists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a lot to do with controlling citizens.  Especially those who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been &quot;law abiding&quot;.  So I feel that the government is well aware that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is driving many citizens to the point of desperation, and is intending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be able to ride out the storm.  Like Napoleon as the Corporal of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Guard (I think he was still a corporal then), they will be able to draw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a deadline, and kill anyone who crosses it.  I don't know how that bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of history will work out this time around, but if we live to see it, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will consider ourselves quite lucky if we live through it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### I wasn't quite able to find out if you were pointing out the inadequacy
<br>
of minimum wage laws, asserting their superiority over minimum wage
<br>
subsidies, or making other points. My previous posts merely indicated that
<br>
the minimum wage law is not a good way of helping the poor, that it in fact
<br>
it reduces their chances of improving their lives, and that changing it in
<br>
favor of flat-tax supported wage subsidies is likely to be a more effective
<br>
way of providing help.
