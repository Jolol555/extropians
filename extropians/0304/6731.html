<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; do it, but they were blamed anyway.  (It did happen while they were in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; charge, soon after the conquest of Alexandria.)  Now Bagdad's library 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't as significant, but it wasn't minor.  Especially if Arabic is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; native tongue.  Whatever our reputation was, it's now worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some people care about what others think more than others do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are many occasions when one has to worry about what one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will think of himself, rather than be concerned about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others will think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how this generality is germane to the particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.  The topic is about US reputation.
</em><br>
<p>It's the same with nations, of course: a nation can be so
<br>
disposed that it cares less, or more, about public opinion
<br>
than others.
<br>
<p>At the same time, I wonder if Americans who in general are
<br>
more concerned with what others think about them as individuals
<br>
tend to be those who worry about what other nations think.  In
<br>
other words, is there a correlation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The deeper issue, alas, as always, is the predictability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your making a statement like that.  Have any thoughts on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more fundamental issue of why in general you and others are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on one side and so many other people are clearly on the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What truly distinguishes you from them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is in my opinion uncalled for.  Either the statement is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable and raises reasonable issues or it does not.  That X 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more likely to make such a statement is irrelevant to this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular thread.  That one is in a minority says nothing for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or against the validity of the minority position.
</em><br>
<p>Rather than continue to exchange emails venting our opinions,
<br>
I'm always for trying to understand how it can be that people
<br>
so fundamentally disagree.  But we've been here before, and
<br>
I know that you and many others are not particularly interested
<br>
in exploring the &quot;conflict of visions&quot;, nor in attempting to
<br>
determine if personality or environmental factors decide.
<br>
