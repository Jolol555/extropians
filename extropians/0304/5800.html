<p>Yes, but of course the $10 billion question is what Reality 
<br>
actually is.  From within such states it feels as if one's eyes 
<br>
are open and one truly sees for the first time.  For me it is 
<br>
like opening my eyes from within everything there is across all 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;space-time plus the most profound joy and peace - literally 
<br>
beyond imagining.  In my misspent near-hippie youth I reached 
<br>
part of such a state with LSD but that was more mechanical 
<br>
feeling and not as unitive or blissful.  Then it felt more like 
<br>
walking beneath the &quot;skin of reality&quot; if you will, being at the 
<br>
level from which all being springs.  These things are 
<br>
notoriously difficult to describe of course.  It is part of the 
<br>
symptoms that ones conceptual facilities or at least the 
<br>
verbalization parts shutdown or are bypassed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is actually what bothers me as a materialistic neuroscientist. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have brain systems that tell us about the salience, familiarity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely the perceived truth of things. If these were simply made fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; active we would experience whatever we see or think as totally true and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond doubt (even the dualist explanation that truth is experienced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly by the soul doesn't work, since the same argument could go for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the corresponding truth-detection system within the soul).
</em><br>
<p>You are on to something here I believe.  There has been research 
<br>
into what goes on in the brain when very advanced meditators go 
<br>
into samadhi/satori/divine union.  Unfortunately I gave my best 
<br>
book on this away so I can't do much justice to the details. 
<br>
(An interesting online work is at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.noetic.org/ions/medbiblio/ch2_1.htm">http://www.noetic.org/ions/medbiblio/ch2_1.htm</a>).  But it was 
<br>
found that certain brain centers, especially vocalization and 
<br>
sense of spatial orientation, become relatively starved of 
<br>
energy (oxygen?) and other sections become very super-energized. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that cosmic oceaning feeling and very high 
<br>
degrees of bliss and many parts of the brain firing much more 
<br>
than normal.  And this is in non-epileptics.   I have my 
<br>
suspicions, although the books did not go that far, that some of 
<br>
the yogic, meditation, diet, even celibacy practices make these 
<br>
states much more reachable and indeed may fire them off.  I am 
<br>
not very advanced at all in meditation by some of the forms I 
<br>
have learned do produce a &quot;spiritualization&quot; effect where 
<br>
everything looks different and I notice my interest, attention, 
<br>
feeling of energy flow within myself changes.  Some of the 
<br>
changes are quite positive and I am much more peaceful and 
<br>
filled with love. But the downside is that I notice that my 
<br>
thinking/interests/speed of uptake of new information, churning 
<br>
of existing knowledge into new combinations all seems to be a 
<br>
bit muted.  If I go into this spiritual practice, many things I 
<br>
am normally quite interested in seem much less important than 
<br>
going deeper into the spiritual space.  It is quite seductive to 
<br>
those who get into it a ways.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So if someone makes me experience this sense of total Truth, how am I to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know it is real truth or just my hippocampus getting all excited? Even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse, while I can make this argument right now sitting in my office 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with no divinities around, if one would appear it seems likely that at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least while that experience lasted I would be fully convinced regardless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my current doubts. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  The mind also goes on overdrive weaving together a 
<br>
super-coherent mega-Rationalization that is extremely overpowering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This makes me suspect that I would not (later on) find any divinity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearing in full majesty very convincing. To really be a convincing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divinity it would have to convince me without any neurological dramas. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Just the facts, Lord&quot; :-)  None of this hyper-bliss fire and 
<br>
smoke stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just asking &quot;please grant me a bit of limited omniscience so that I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think up a good question and understand the answer&quot; (which I consider to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a very neat idea; a bit like the encounter with the eponymous entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Hamilton's _The Naked God_) wouldn't work, since I could always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given an experience of having had indescribable experiences (now nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faded) and a very convincing but deep answer I almost but not quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could remember.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have had some experiences where I carried just enough 
<br>
skepticism in to attempt to organize and bring out some of the 
<br>
things I was sure I knew and knew completely within the 
<br>
experience.  I once had it all laid out in order only to watch 
<br>
in horror as one piece of this fabulous knowledge after another 
<br>
disappeared until what remained was just another stutter 
<br>
description of the ineffable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe we are going about all this from the wrong direction, trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a superbeing to demonstrate that it is the supreme super being. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is far easier for it to demonstrate that it is merely a super being in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some practical sense (lift mountains, turn the sea to blood, solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diophantine equations instantly). It is probably because we all here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to hail from the monotheistic cultural sphere. What questions would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you ask Pallas Athene or Thoth if they appeared to you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>They are much less interesting.  Mere advanced transhumans with 
<br>
access to good nanotech could probably do or convince us they 
<br>
did, most of those things.  So what?
