(I'm leaving aside comments on many of Lee's comments since we will
<br>
most likely deal with them offlist and perhaps produce a paper).

<p>Granted -- I suspect that Rafal or Anders could comment more
<br>
authoritatively on this.

</em><br>
<p>I'm wrestling with the limits-of-known-physics problems.  Eric's
<br>
design for a 1 cm^3 nanocomputer requires 100,000 watts of power.
<br>
Now Eric may know how to deliver that much power to that small of
<br>
a volume but I certainly don't.  Nanotech -- even running at
<br>
extremly efficient rates does produce heat.  Eric (and Kieth Henson)
<br>
did patent the most efficient heat removal system I'm aware of
<br>
[Henson, H. K., and K. E. Drexler. (1988) Heterodensity heat
<br>
transfer apparatus and method.  U.S. Patent #4,759,404] -- it
<br>
is discussed to some extent in Nanosystems.
<br>
<p>Bottom line (for my thinking) is that if you are going to measure
<br>
the location and type of trillions (or more) atoms one is going to
<br>
have to wrestle with some significant power delivery and heat removal
<br>
problems.  To the best of my knowledge nobody has looked at this.
<br>
Its impact may be that there may be some very significant time
<br>
constraints on how fast one could do even a destructive upload.
<br>
It could well be that one might be consumed by ones internal
<br>
bacteria before a reliable upload could be accomplished.
<br>
Of course one can work around this by working at cryogenic
<br>
temperatures -- but then that places severe constraints on
<br>
the amount of heat the uploading process can generate.
<br>
Uploading (or teleporting) might well end up having to be
<br>
a *very* slow process.
