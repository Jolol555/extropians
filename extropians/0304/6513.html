</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the guy pulling a gun on you can be further dissected like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. &quot;Potential threat&quot; is that there's some mean-looking guy walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your direction, who may or may not have a weapon (no direct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence). This may be a reson for concern, but I'm certainly not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to blow the guy's head off just for looking suspicious. 
</em><br>
<p>This isn't really analogous to the real world situation. Better
<br>
description would be a gun walking in your direction, wearing gang
<br>
colors and tatoos, who you have witnessed mugging other neighbors in
<br>
the past, you've even stopped one of them yourself, yet the police
<br>
refuse to do anything about the punk because he is paying various
<br>
police commissioners off.
<br>
<p>Such an individual is certainly a potential threat to you, even if he
<br>
has never threatened you, sent hit squads after you, or put out a
<br>
contract on your head. While the police refuse to do anything about
<br>
him, you are entirely justified in taking him on, if you are equipped
<br>
and trained to do so, and are willing to accept the risks. 
<br>
<p>Sure, the police will then try to prosecute you afterwards (because
<br>
their gravy train has been cut off) but the public will know that what
<br>
you've done is merely homicide in the public interest. If you can avoid
<br>
prosecution, or have good lawyers, you have nothing to worry about.
