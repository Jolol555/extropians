<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ...we ended up skipping two years of high school and starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; college at F.I.T. at age 16.  That option worked great for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; mind, but horrible for our social development.  Sixteen-year old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; males on campus were freaks, nerds and did not fit in well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is mostly a myth, and a very dangerous one.  Geeks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to be social misfits /regardless/ of their surroundings.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents took the route of keeping me with my age-peers rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advancing me early, and (1) I was just as much an outcast then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and am just as socially retarded now as I might have been had I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced, and (2) I sleep-walked through most of school and didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn a damned thing I didn't know already.
</em><br>
<p>I concur with this. My parents treated me the same way, and even used
<br>
my desire to attend the Air Force Academy to get me to be more 'well
<br>
rounded'. Even when I was captain of the school ski team, worked as a
<br>
ski instructor at the local ski area, I was still an unsocial and
<br>
unaccepted geek whose only girlfriend was on the math team of a
<br>
neighboring school... 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, this 'well rounding' exercise left me entirely unprepared
<br>
to pursue a higher education (not in terms of aptitude or knowledge,
<br>
but in discipline and motivation). At the nerd college I went to (WPI)
<br>
I was the campus 'Bluto' (the Animal House character) from the very
<br>
first week of my freshman year and my studies suffered significantly.
<br>
<p>It took me 7-10 years to rediscover my inner nerd, and I am still
<br>
playing catch up as a result. I am socially gregarious when I feel like
<br>
it, but generally enjoy entirely isolating myself with books or
<br>
computers more often. My income has been permanently stunted, and I
<br>
really have difficulty forgiving those who manipulated my development
<br>
so.
<br>
<p>Just as 'mainstreaming' has failed miserably with the learning
<br>
disabled, it also fails miserably with the gifted student, by actively
<br>
making the gifted into learning disabled by killing their curiosity,
<br>
motivation, and discipline. Any parent or teacher who tries to
<br>
'mainstream' a gifted child should be charged with child abuse in my
<br>
not so humble but highly informed opinion.
