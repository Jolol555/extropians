<em>&gt; I have come up with a new paradox in Special Relativity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was explaining a typical thought experiment to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquaintance in order to convey why mass increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurs.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, in modern treatments of Special Relativity, relativistic mass
<br>
increase is no longer considered to be the best way of understanding
<br>
the phenomena.  My son is in college and just studied SR last term,
<br>
and he confirms this.  Teachers downplay the notion of &quot;relativistic
<br>
mass&quot; because it leads to so many confusing situations like the one
<br>
you describe.  Instead, they use the idea of &quot;relativistic momentum&quot;
<br>
which is equal to rest mass, times velocity, times the &quot;gamma&quot; parameter,
<br>
1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2).  By sticking with momentum and energy, you don't have
<br>
to imagine that mass increases.
<br>
<p>The old way took that same formula, p = v * m * gamma (where m is rest
<br>
mass), and grouped the last two terms to produce the &quot;relativistic mass&quot;,
<br>
which went to infinity as v approached c.  But as I said that produced a
<br>
lot of confusion.  Among the problems would be the question of whether
<br>
a sufficiently fast moving particle would become a black hole when its
<br>
&quot;relativistic mass&quot; got high enough.  Basically anything involving
<br>
gravitation causes problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay, so you are approaching a solar system at speed v
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your rocket ship, and you see a planet orbiting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; star.  You are traveling perpendicularly to the plane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the orbit of the planet.  So imagine that the planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is orbiting the star like the tip of a minute hand is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbiting the center of a clock on the wall, and you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walking towards the clock straight on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now because physical processes happen in that solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system in your frame of reference more slowly than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do in the that solar system's frame, you observe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planet is moving around its star not very fast.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, judging from the usual mass of that kind of star,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its amazing how slowly that planet is revolving about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So using some typical formulas, you calculate the mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the star, and find it to be rather picayune.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold on!  Special relativity predicts that your measurements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the star should make it *more* massive, not less.  Paradox!
</em><br>
<p>Despite what I said above, I will give a solution in terms of relativistic
<br>
mass.  The answer is that gravitational attraction depends on rest mass
<br>
and not relativistic mass.  Of course, that is an over-simplification because
<br>
you need General Relativity to analyze gravitation.  But for small fields
<br>
you can do OK with Special Relativity, and in that case you need to do it
<br>
this way.
<br>
<p>By definition, the rest mass of the planet and star are constant and
<br>
independent of velocity; therefore the gravitational attraction is
<br>
unchanged.  Yet the planet's inertial mass has increased because of its
<br>
velocity (remember I am using &quot;relativistic mass&quot; here).  Therefore it
<br>
is much heavier and will respond much more slowly to the same force,
<br>
hence you see it revolving around the star very slowly.
<br>
<p>Or you can solve it without relativistic mass, by going back to the
<br>
formula above, p = m * v * gamma, and understanding that p and v are
<br>
vectors while m and gamma are scalars.  Gamma is large in this situation,
<br>
and it boosts the momentum components in the orbital plane as well as the
<br>
big component perpendicular to the orbit.  So we have a higher momentum
<br>
than would be calculated by Newtonian physics, hence a given force will
<br>
produce a smaller change in momentum, where we use F = dp/dt.
