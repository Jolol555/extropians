<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hmmm.  How is this *not* a frightening new chapter in US foreign 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy?  We have struck preemptively so it is not just a matter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of posturing.
</em><br>
<p>I would say the US has justified the strike by *labeling* it
<br>
pre-emptive, and post 9-11 this was probably inevitable. When your enemy
<br>
is terrorism, you're fighting a method and not a person. But it's merely
<br>
a trick of argument. This label reduces the amount of hard evidence
<br>
needed to bring the public on-board. The Bush Administration didn't have
<br>
the incontrovertible facts so they said,  &quot;The threat may materialize,
<br>
we need to strike now.&quot; In the absence of strong evidence to convince
<br>
most people, pre-emption lets theories make up the difference. If it's a
<br>
frightening chapter of anything, it's a frightening chapter in US public
<br>
militarism. In the weeks leading up to past wars (Desert Storm, Bosnia,
<br>
Kosovo, Somalia) the US public required factual evidence to support
<br>
military action. Such was provided by the government and the media. Now,
<br>
post 9-11, the public is willing to accept theoretical evidence (a good
<br>
story). Post 9-11, can they be blamed? Maybe. But if there's any blame
<br>
or credit to be had in this war, the Bush Administration gets only small
<br>
bit of it in my mind. The US public is ultimately responsible for
<br>
believing the evidence offered. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Why should nations think twice about WMD when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having real WMD is the only apparent deterrent to the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preemptively attacking to prevent it?  Witness North Korea.
</em><br>
<p>You can't deter or prevent someone from getting WMD who already has
<br>
them. But I understand your point. You're arguing that the case of North
<br>
Korea shows that having WMD will bring the US to the table. Each country
<br>
must weigh the benefits and risks. On the one hand, a country may pursue
<br>
a secret WMD program, try to keep it secret, and risk an attack
<br>
justified as pre-emptive. Or they can give up the quest for WMD, and
<br>
risk not having them when needed. Which is the greater risk? The US
<br>
hopes that by destroying Saddam Hussein and all of his cohort they have
<br>
proven that the risk of the former outweighs the risk of the latter.
<br>
After all, it was the US claiming Saddam had non-nuclear WMD in the
<br>
first place and that didn't stop them. The current tally seems to be:
<br>
nukes will deter the US, chemical and biological WMD will not.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Terrorism ia used to justify coming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above board with a great number of foreign and domestic dirty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricks and increasing their thoroughness.  The threat is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just to foreign peoples and government but to our own rights and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom.  The government should be losing the faith of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American people.  I am surprised its reputation does not appear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to he deteriorating more rapidly at home.
</em><br>
<p>I am reminded of Tim May's 1996 essay _True Nyms and Crypto Anarchy_ in
<br>
which he identified his 'Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse' -- terrorism,
<br>
child pornography, racism, and money laundering. He said these four
<br>
things are and will continue to be used to justify restrictions on
<br>
strong encryption software, digital cash, anonymity, and data havens. He
<br>
was clairvoyant beyond his predictions, it seems, as terrorism has now
<br>
been used as a part of the logic for war. But, you bring up a curious
<br>
dissonance. 9-11 paved the way for a power-grab by the executive branch.
<br>
Libertarians and anarcho-capitalists it seems should be up-in-arms about
<br>
it, yet many of the most outspoken support the war and the
<br>
Administration. I think that freedom-loving people should be very
<br>
nervous. Pre-emptive thinking is the first step on a slippery slope.
