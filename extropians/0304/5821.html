Coyote asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I would ask
<br>
'Um.. Scuze' me GodBeings,  What questions might I ask other being that
<br>
claim to be Gods, that would validate (to me) that they were indeed Gods?' &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Joke response: z-zz-z-z-ZOTT! crackle!, rumble! Got any more questions, 
<br>
mortal?
<br>
<p>Or, as was said in GhostBusters1: &quot;Are you a god?&quot; Uh...no. &quot;Then Die!&quot;&quot;
<br>
<p>Other answers Coyote might get are...
<br>
&quot;Hey, its like Jazz, if ya have to ask what it is, then don't bother asking&quot;
<br>
or--
<br>
&quot;Who you calling a Gawd!?&quot;
<br>
or--
<br>
I will be happy to create some valuable matter (to you) out of nothing. Now 
<br>
that I have performed such a trick, do you feel I am worthy of worship? Why 
<br>
do you think your worship is of any practical use to me? Why do you think 
<br>
praying to me does you any good? I probably shan't hang around this part of 
<br>
the universe for very long, because there are more interesting domains to 
<br>
cover, then this berg, frankly speaking.
<br>
or--
<br>
If they are any gods worth admiring, I would find one that teaches you how to 
<br>
make more resources and goodies for yourselves, and live better. Here, let me 
<br>
show you some nanotechnology goodies that will lift you oinkers out of the 
<br>
pig-pens you now inhabit. Pay close attention and take notes cause  I gotta 
<br>
move on out to the Sombrero Galaxy and convert it, over 100k years into a 
<br>
Bradbury Matrioshka thingy dingy, and not some cheesy dyson sphere, that I 
<br>
could knock out over the course of a working weekend.
<br>
<p>Sincerely, Olaf Stapledon's accountant
