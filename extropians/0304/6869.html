<br>
<p>Yes you are looking at the right articles.  And your
<br>
comments would generally be correct as far as I know
<br>
without digging into the textbooks.  I too generally
<br>
agree with the comments about considering single amino
<br>
acids as &quot;drugs&quot; though I'm opposed to the FDA regulating
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>The problem I see with limiting methionine or cysteine
<br>
is that they are primary sources of sulfur, which I
<br>
believe is an essential component of glutathione which
<br>
is a major antioxidant.  So perhaps one might want to
<br>
limit those but supplement with either glutathione or
<br>
N-acetyl-cysteine (though that might defeat the
<br>
purpose of cysteine restriction).
<br>
<p>The problem I see is that I don't believe we know yet
<br>
precisely where in the pathways the &quot;detection&quot; of
<br>
low essential amino acids are and how they upregulate
<br>
protein recycling.  But I'd guess we will know that
<br>
within this decade.  It seems likely that they should
<br>
be highly conserved biochemical detection/regulation
<br>
systems.
