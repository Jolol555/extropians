</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I were to say &quot;Hey gts, what do you think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the KKK?&quot; is it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconceivable that you would reply &quot;They're scum&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and should I think less
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct, they are scum.
</em><br>
<p>The key point is this, John: 
<br>
<p>We can say without drawing much objection that a
<br>
member of the KKK is &quot;scum&quot; for the reason that White
<br>
Supremicism has been widely discredited by intelligent
<br>
thoughtful people with *valid logical arguments*.
<br>
<p>However such statements are not themselves part of any
<br>
valid logical argument. They do nothing to further
<br>
discredit White Supremicism, and thus they add nothing
<br>
of value to any debate about the subject of White
<br>
Supremicism (especially in a debate with a White
<br>
Supremicist, in which case it becomes serious ad
<br>
hominem). Such statements are just a waste of time.
<br>
They are sound and fury signifying nothing more than
<br>
primitive emotion, emotion which may or may not have
<br>
any rational basis. 
<br>
<p>White Supremicism isn't bad because its proponents are
<br>
scum. Rather, its proponents can be defined as scum
<br>
without much objection because White Supremicism is
<br>
bad and can be proven so with valid logical arguments
<br>
(but needn't be explicity proven so in most debates
<br>
with intelligent people, because that valid argument
<br>
is already widely accepted and in the public domain.)
<br>
<p>If you don't follow my reasoning above then you might
<br>
just as well argue that the earth is flat. After all,
<br>
Hitler believed the earth is round and we all know
<br>
that bastard was scum.
