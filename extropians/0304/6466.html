<p>This is something I've wondered about.  How could deep-water ocean fish have

been part of the Paleo diet?  I guess salmon could be caught on their spawning

runs, if they spawned near our ancestors.  But surely catching lots of fish

in the open ocean must have been rather late development... not that I've ever

seen a history of fishing.

<p>I'm pretty sure I said at the same time that they weren't complete.
<br>
'decently' isn't being used as a synonym for 'complete', but as some gut
<br>
metric of how good the food is.  I look at grains and think &quot;not bad, got the
<br>
protein and fiber and iron, need to worry about vitamins A and C and calcium,
<br>
but the first two are easy to get...&quot;  It wouldn't really do as a sole food
<br>
source but then I think most things don't, either because they don't have
<br>
enough of something or because they have too much of something.  Good grains
<br>
make progress.  Coca-cola doesn't.
