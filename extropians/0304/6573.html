From: spike66 [mailto:<a href="mailto:spike66@attbi.com?Subject=RE:%20evolution%20by%20mate%20selection,%20gene%20manipulation">spike66@attbi.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; In a society in which mate selection is driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by female choice, would we not see a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of characteristics emerge than in a society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which mate selection is driven by male choice?
</em><br>
<p>Spike, this is an interesting idea.  I'm not convinced that mate
<br>
selection in modern western societies is dominated by female choice,
<br>
but if it were so I see the logic in what you're proposing.
<br>
<p>I'd encourage you to pick up a copy of Jared Diamond's _The Third
<br>
Chimpanzee_ (if you haven't read it already) for a short primer on
<br>
sexual selection in humans.  Diamond documents that across all studied
<br>
human cultures, humans select mates with characteristics similar to
<br>
the people they were exposed to in childhood.  Since for most of
<br>
evolutionary history you were exposed primarily to your relatives in
<br>
childhood, people tend to choose mates with characteristics similar to
<br>
their own.
<br>
<p>Interestingly enough, the data Diamond presents show that sexual
<br>
selection preferences are much stronger for /personality/ attributes
<br>
than for /physical/ attributes.  Humans tend to be exceptionally
<br>
similar to their mates in basic personality traits such as
<br>
agreeableness, neuroticism, and novelty-seeking.
<br>
<p>The book also gives a good overview of the differences in mating
<br>
behavior between various primate species - including humans - and how
<br>
that has affected the evolution of those species.  Quite interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since human babies have relatively large heads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with respect to their bodies, perhaps female-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice societies would tend to evolve populations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with bulbous heads.  That is the best way I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain how humans came to have such enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains, making us far smarter than is optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for mere survival, and far smarter than is optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for maximum reproduction.
</em><br>
<p>I believe the standard theory at this point is that our big brains
<br>
arose as part of an evolutionary arms race /within/ the human species.
<br>
Our ability to model other humans put us in a situation where we could
<br>
try to out-think and out-plan competitors inside or outside of our
<br>
tribe, particularly in the search for mates and food.  This put heavy
<br>
selection pressure on human modeling abilities.  Stephen Pinker
<br>
presents this hypothesis in _How the Mind Works_.
<br>
<p>cheers,
