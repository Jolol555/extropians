<p><em>&gt;        I walked into my favorite Pakistani grocery store and was greeted by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proprietor a sharp young entrepreneur.  He was watching a video while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waiting for a customer.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I commented that the movie looked like something out of Hollywood when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was a teenager.  His eyes flashed and he gave me a big grin.  He explained 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the movie was a takeoff from Hollywood and said, &quot;America is popular all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the world, it is the best.&quot;  As he said this he was nodding at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screen.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I asked why?  He explained that the contents of the movie, the song, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dance, the styles and the conduct all represented America and that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle eastern young adults all wanted America because that was freedom.  In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that piece of frivolous entertainment they saw an entire social contract and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they wanted it for themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        It appears that where our diplomats and news media cannot effectively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent us our movie industry does.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it manages to dangle in front of poor people everywhere
<br>
that things are great in America.  I speculate that the tendency
<br>
to envy and resentment is genetically determined;  that is, I
<br>
bet it runs in families.  If this is correct, then for a huge
<br>
percentage of the world's people, these images create immense
<br>
longing and frustration.  Your acquaintance appears to either
<br>
be relatively free of such tendencies, or is now exulting that
<br>
he's living in America.
<br>
<p>(So the message of U.S. diplomats and the message of the movie
<br>
industry are definitely about two different kinds of things!)
<br>
<p>But in the book I've almost finished, &quot;World on Fire&quot;, author
<br>
Amy Chau quotes the Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk.  I admire Mr.
<br>
Pamuk's astuteness, perceptivity, and objectivity.  He wrote
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is neither Islam nor even poverty itself that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directly engenders support for terrorists whose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ferocity and ingenuity are unprecedented in human
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history [sic]; it is, rather the crushing humiliation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that has infected the third-world countries.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At no time in history has the gulf between rich and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poor been so wide....at no time in history have the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lives of the rich been so forcefully brought to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attention of the poor through television and Hollywood
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;films....But far worse, at no other time have the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world's rich and powerful societies been so clearly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right, and &quot;reasonable&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today an ordinary citizen of a poor undemocratic Muslim 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country, or a civil servant in a third-world country
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or in a former socialist republic struggling to make
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ends meet, is aware of how insubstantial is his share
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the world's wealth; he knows that he lives under
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conditions that are much harsher and more devastating
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that those of a &quot;Westerner&quot; and that he is condemned
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a much shorter life.  At the same time, however, he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense in a corner of his mind that his poverty is to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some considerable degree the fault of his own folly and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inadequacy, or those of his father and grandfather.  The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western world is scarcely aware of this overwhelming
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feeling of humiliation that is experiences by most of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world's population.
<br>
<p>So long as people feel pride in achievements that they personally
<br>
had nothing to do with, so long as people resent others who have
<br>
or achieve more, nothing will change.  The only ray of hope is
<br>
that perhaps before long one will be able to choose what feelings
<br>
to have.
<br>
