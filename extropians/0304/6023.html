But the key question here is &quot;What do you mean rich?&quot;.  You certainly 
<br>
aren't talking about the amount of money, or one could accomplish this 
<br>
easily with inflation.  You aren't talking about the speed with which 
<br>
money flows, as that's just inflation under a new disguise.  You could 
<br>
be talking about the quantity of tangible goods, but this is only &quot;rich&quot; 
<br>
if they are accessible by those who use them in some way (including 
<br>
storing them for specified future use).
<br>
<p>My definition of rich would be &quot;the ability of people to acquire the 
<br>
tools to accomplish projects without expending their life in the 
<br>
acquisition&quot;.  That's a bit flakey, and needs much more precision, but 
<br>
if people can't do things, then they aren't rich.  If only a few can 
<br>
choose what to do, then the society isn't rich, though those few people 
<br>
may be.  etc.  Land and other tangible property thus enters into the 
<br>
equation as one of the tools that allows one to accomplish the works 
<br>
that one intends.
<br>
<p>Considering &quot;money&quot; here is a bit of misdirection.  Money is a set of 
<br>
crooked accounting records.  The accounting records enable one to make 
<br>
fair exchanges.  One puts up with their being crooked, because there 
<br>
isn't much choice.
