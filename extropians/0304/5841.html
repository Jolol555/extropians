<em>&gt; &gt; I would like some help with a model in which minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laws would have a positive effect on the wealth of, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society, then the lowest wage earners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know some economists have done stuff like this already.  I have a vague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory of the mechanism being something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   * raising minimum wage gives more money to workers, possibly unemploying some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   * but workers spend the money they get, vs. the rich people the money was taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     from who saved most of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   * so demand increases, calling for more workers to be employed to satisfy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     demand.
</em><br>
<p>A good, more plausible but perhaps questionable assumptions, thanks.
<br>
<p>4. Saving money, especially by the rich, has no salutary side-effects
<br>
<p>Another interesting assumption that seems to be embedded here is
<br>
a complex dynamic model of an economy in which there is a &quot;maximum&quot;
<br>
or maximally beneficial level at which &quot;churning&quot; can take place:
<br>
that is, people are paid more than their work would normally command
<br>
but that unnatural stimulus far from having a distorting or adverse
<br>
effect actually circularly creates wealth.  This might not be too
<br>
dissimilar from the government just calling in one of the old dollars
<br>
and replacing it with two of the new ones, or inflating the economy.
<br>
<p>Whatever its (dubious) plausibility, this scheme also suffers from
<br>
reductio ad absurdum:  why not just pass a law that causes the workers
<br>
to be paid a ridiculously high wage, with the understanding that they'll
<br>
just really go out and spend it all back into the economy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another angle might be to throw out the assumption of a perfect market.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole thing of equilibrium price and minimum wage being a price floor above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that comes out of models of perfectly competitive markets, at least in simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyses.  But if employers are an oligopoly -- market power and all that --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising the legal wage might just shift some of the profits to the workers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without causing unemployment.
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p>5. The number of employers and number of jobs are fixed.
<br>
<p>This is a little similar to #2 and #3 below, but in some
<br>
historical cases, actually obtains, I think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't claim that's a solid idea, just an angle I can think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of.  Hopefully I'll stay out of arguments about this, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's real literature I haven't read on the subject.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, well, thanks anyway.  Like I said before, I'm trying
<br>
to figure out the most plausible set of assumptions held
<br>
by people who favor the existence of minimum-wage laws.
<br>
<p>Here is the current set:
<br>
<p>1. Higher minimum wage does not eliminate the existence of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs due to advances in technology.
<br>
<p>2. There is no supply and demand relationship affecting the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value of worker efforts, (and hence their retainability).
<br>
<p>3. Jobs are givens: in black and white terms, society needs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to perform and will perform a job X, or it will not.
<br>
<p>4. Saving money, especially by the rich, has no salutary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side-effects.
<br>
<p>5. The number of employers and number of jobs are fixed.
