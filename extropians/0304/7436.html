<em>&gt;&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt;I've seen only two theoretical arguments for vegetarianism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1) the argument that humans have a moral obligation to minimize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;suffering in the world, including the suffering of animals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;2) the argument that humans are best genetically adapted to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;diet limited only to plant foods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a very obvious third argument, which is that a vegetarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet is beneficial to health in the present environment with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present availability of foods, whether we're &quot;adapted&quot; to it or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That (plus a bit of #1) was certainly my reason for being vegetarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for 3-4 years. Later research didn't support the idea, so I'm back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the beef now, but I never for moment bought the argument that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were datapted for vegetarianism.
</em><br>
<p>This can turn into a very complicated question.  My
<br>
notion is that some life is better than no life, so
<br>
if we devour beef, we create a market for it, giving
<br>
cows life that they would not have otherwise had.
<br>
<p>Hunting wild animals is not so simple either.  As Mike
<br>
points out, the population of wild game is controlled
<br>
by both predation and food sources.  By slaying some of
<br>
the deer, the others have more food.
<br>
<p>Still more complicated is the fish scene, for most fish
<br>
are caught from the wild, thus ending their lives when
<br>
they were presumably neither starving nor brought into
<br>
existence solely for my enjoyment.  So given a choice,
<br>
I would opt for farm raised fish.
<br>
<p>Turns out the government is cooperating.  Legislation
<br>
has been proposed to allow wild-caught fish to be
<br>
labelled organic, whereas farm fish cannot, unless
<br>
special expensive measures are followed.  Regardless
<br>
of the soundness of the logic, the ethical sushi
<br>
devourer would select non-organic fish.  This choice
<br>
would also create a bigger market for farm fish,
<br>
giving us a ready-made market for all those turkey
<br>
scraps and other bio-waste.  Everyone wins in that
<br>
deal, eh?
