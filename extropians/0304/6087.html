Michael Dickey asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I am in absolute shock and awe that no one felt the events of yesterday 
<br>
were
<br>
worthy of mention.  Here the symbolic downfall of one of the worst murderous
<br>
dictators in the world took place, and people held under his oppresion
<br>
rejoiced and desicrated the stalinistic reminders of his murderous rule.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I speak for myself, that the reason I am not swept away, joyously; is that I 
<br>
am very cynical about the Arab Muslim peoples becoming &quot;libertarian 
<br>
rationalists&quot; anytime soon. Hopefully, we can have a moderate pro-American 
<br>
regime for a few years, until the next great dictator takes over. Meanwhile I 
<br>
celebrate the primary reason for the deposition of the regime; the 
<br>
neutralization of an economic and technical resource base for weapons of mass 
<br>
destruction falling into the hands of anti-American Jihadis.
<br>
For that, and that alone, I am grateful. The potential of Iraqis to 
<br>
contribute to technical progress is there, but the desire...?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;What happened to the hundreds of thousands of civilian causalties, the
<br>
angered and embittered Iraqi people, who instead were joyous and
<br>
celibratory.  How are those who opposed to this reconciling these images
<br>
with their opposition?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>A fair amount of people on this list are not geared toward this victory, and 
<br>
wish it didn't occur, moreover; desired American defeat. I assume your were 
<br>
being rhetorical with your statements, Michael; but in any case Extropians 
<br>
are also a microcosm of the fault lines that divide the human species. 
<br>
Finally, the way the war is being fought, in such a different manner, the 
<br>
speed, the sectionalization of actual violence, the lack of confirmation of 
<br>
the end of the regimes' leaders, may leave some uncoordinated to adjust to 
<br>
this &quot;new&quot; change.
<br>
<p>Mitch
