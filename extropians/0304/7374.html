<p>
I've been watching this company for a couple of months. Their financials
<br>
are weak, but ignoring fiduciary arcana, this is a damn cool idea. I had
<br>
been batting around some ideas (hopelessly primitive) about brute-force
<br>
context-mapping as an approach to langauge translation software, but I
<br>
just never knew enough about Bayesian stats to come up with what these
<br>
guys have apparently been working on since the early 90s. BTW, in the
<br>
interest of full disclosure, I don't own any stock in this company.

<p>-------------------------------------    
<br>
<p>Autonomy Corporation plc
<br>
(NasdaqNM:AUTN)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
From Yahoo:
<br>
<p>&quot;Autonomy Corporation plc is a provider of infrastructure software. The
<br>
Company's technology powers applications dependent upon unstructured
<br>
information, including e-commerce, customer relationship management
<br>
(CRM), knowledge management, enterprise information portals, enterprise
<br>
resource planning (ERP) and online publishing. . .&quot;
<br>
<p>From the company website: <a href="http://www.autonomy.com/">http://www.autonomy.com/</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Autonomy's strength lies in a unique combination of technologies that
<br>
employs advanced pattern-matching techniques utilizing Bayesian
<br>
Inference and Claude Shannon's principles of information theory. By
<br>
automatically forming an understanding of the concepts within the
<br>
content of a piece of text or voice or by analysing an image or piece of
<br>
video, Autonomy's software is able to perform a limitless combination of
<br>
content-to-content, content-to-people or people-to-people interactions
<br>
and tasks. . .&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Fun article, nothing deep: <a href="http://www.rkdn.org/innovations/bayesian.asp">http://www.rkdn.org/innovations/bayesian.asp</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;The mathematical processes behind Autonomy's methods are complex, but
<br>
the promise itself is simple: to enable computers to extract meaning
<br>
from text and to use that meaning to better categorize and deliver
<br>
useful information. While computers have long been able to identify
<br>
strings of keywords, anyone who's used a search engine can testify to
<br>
its limits. What makes Autonomy's products different is an underlying
<br>
pattern-recognition algorithm, derived from Bayes' formulations, which
<br>
empowers computers to act as if they possessed abilities we think of as
<br>
subtly and profoundly human: comprehending context, generalizing from
<br>
words to an idea, even understanding the unspoken by grasping the root
<br>
concepts beneath the play of syntax.&quot;
