<em>&gt;&gt;My notion is that in general, the evolutionary

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;positive feedback mechanisms, whereas survival
</em><br>

<em>&gt; I'm not sure I can agree with this, spike. Judging by the fame and fortune

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joe DiMaggio, I think it's safe to say that many modern men are inclined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mate with women like her. Is this going to lead to positive feedback from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern mate selection? I dunno. I wince when I think of what it might mean

<p>Hmmm, Im not sure what to make of your Marilyn Monroe
<br>
example.  I think you are fearing that in modern times
<br>
the mentally deficient have a reproductive advantage
<br>
over their mentally adequate counterparts.  Of this I
<br>
tend to agree, however this has little to do with the
<br>
survival of the species, for humans are currently faaaar
<br>
smarter than optimal for maximum reproduction, it would
<br>
seem.
<br>
<p>In any case, focus on the notion of evolution having two
<br>
distinct mechanisms, survival selection and mate selection,
<br>
the latter of which may be thought of as survival selection
<br>
at the genome level.  I am interested in trying to make
<br>
simulations of evolution sophisticated enough to determine
<br>
if survival selection leads to negative feedback loops
<br>
whereas mate selection leads to positive feedback loops.
<br>
If this is true, does it matter if a mating is female-
<br>
choice dominated or male-choice dominated?
<br>
<p>Marilyn's dumbness was an act, by the way.
