It wouldn't work because most people see themselves as being in the 
<br>
upper 50% of the population in income, or expect that they will be next 
<br>
year.  This is clearly impossible, but people tend to be optomistic.
<br>
My personal thought on the matter is that taxes should be on a simple:
<br>
tax = rate * income - povertylevel
<br>
basis.  With all sources of cash counted as income, and no exemptions 
<br>
for any reason.  If you want to subsidize something, do it outside of 
<br>
the tax code.  This provides incentive to all people at every income 
<br>
level to increase their income, and doesn't leave anyone to &quot;starve in 
<br>
the dark&quot;.  And it's simple.  People understand linear equations (though 
<br>
perhaps not when they are hit with them in math class).  People can 
<br>
generally even understand simple parabolic equations, thought they need 
<br>
to do a &quot;following&quot; manuver to project them.  But linear is the easy and 
<br>
intuitive one.
