</em><br>
<p>I know that this list can be exasperating at times, Samantha,
<br>
but I would ask that people in general restrain from empty
<br>
remarks such as this;  as you know well that everyone knows
<br>
that not only governments die during wars, and that chaos often
<br>
follows, and that the U.S.'s record was mixed (mostly, a point
<br>
that *does* evidently need repeating, because the U.S. was 
<br>
involved in a cold war that left few options).  So remarks
<br>
like 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps you know something that I don't
</em><br>
<p>are really obscuring and unhelpful.
<br>
<p>In the thread &quot;Arab World Stunned by Baghdad's Fall&quot; you write
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our motives were not to free the Iraqis.  At one time I believe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you admitted as much at least indirectly.  You have seemed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe the motive was WMD.  We found none.  So do the Iraqis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dancing in the street say that our motives were other than what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were or that the war was justified?  I don't think so.
</em><br>
<p>Firstly, why do you not allow that there can be a mixture
<br>
of motives?  A mixture of motives is often the case when
<br>
decisions are made, at least by adults.  Secondly, there
<br>
really is a HUGE difference between Iraq's case and the
<br>
cases of other countries who eliminated their WMD.  During
<br>
the Clinton administration, in 1993 or 94, Saddam Hussein's
<br>
sons-in-law blew the whistle on him, and pointed the
<br>
inspectors to documents showing there were thousands of
<br>
liters of anthrax and tons of VX nerve gas, (and that they
<br>
were still trying to buy materials to make nuclear weapons).
<br>
<p>Now in South Africa, and Turkmenistan (I think it was), other
<br>
countries that were trying to disarm, there are clear paper
<br>
trails of covering the destruction of the forbidden weapons,
<br>
and plenty of evidence to show what had happened to them.
<br>
There was none in Iraq.  So either the weapons are still
<br>
there, or they have been moved.  They don't just disappear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If my culture comes into your country and blows hell out of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure and perhaps kills some of your loved ones are you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be particularly inclined to absorb my cultural values 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even give them a fair hearing?
</em><br>
<p>Already your words are belied by the events of yesterday
<br>
that have happened after you wrote this.  But in point of
<br>
fact, despite the HUGE destruction of Germany and Japan,
<br>
that's EXACTLY what happened.
<br>
<p>I always wonder why some people so misread the probable
<br>
behavior of others.  For every whacked-out Arab who is
<br>
inspired by the latest show of Western force, there are
<br>
probably five who wonder if their course shouldn't be
<br>
moderated.
