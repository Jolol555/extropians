Lies and the Left
<br>
<p>Galloway and his supporters are foolish to believe that an enemy of 
<br>
America is necessarily their friend
<br>
<p>David Aaronovitch
<br>
Sunday April 27, 2003
<br>
The Observer
<br>
<p>The writs are flying and George Galloway is suing again. For some the 
<br>
sexy question is whether the MP for Glasgow Kelvin benefited 
<br>
personally from money channelled to him by the late government of 
<br>
Saddam Hussein. Oil for suntans, if you like. But though that may be 
<br>
diverting, just as big an issue is that of Iraqi state funding for 
<br>
supposedly independent campaigning organisations involving Mr 
<br>
Galloway, and whether he colluded in this arrangement.
<br>
<p>Immediately after the Daily Telegraph published the first of the 
<br>
documents found in the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, some on the Left were 
<br>
crying 'forgery!' Tariq Ali, interviewed on television, stated 
<br>
bluntly that it was an intelligence scam. The Guardian cartoonist, 
<br>
Martin Rowson, depicted the Telegraph dog digging up bones in a 
<br>
garden full of past security service frauds, with the caption, 
<br>
'Weapons of Mass Distraction', the implication being that the 
<br>
documents were a plant designed to divert attention from the truth 
<br>
about the war. And the editor of Tribune , Mark Seddon, wrote in the 
<br>
Times that 'the discovery is a gift for the Government which has 
<br>
still not found a single shred of evidence for weapons of mass 
<br>
destruction_ (it) comes at a convenient moment_ I am reminded of the 
<br>
Zinoviev letter.'
<br>
<p>In this version of events, the Telegraph journalist, David Blair, is 
<br>
either an accomplice to a grand fraud, or else a preposterous dupe 
<br>
who was guided, without his understanding it, towards one of the most 
<br>
audacious and complex forgeries in British history. And all done to 
<br>
wreak post-war revenge on one MP.
<br>
<p>To me it just shows how deep in denial some on the Left are. And this 
<br>
is, by the way, an argument with the Left, not with the anti-war 
<br>
movement, some of whose leading figures were themselves suspicious of 
<br>
Galloway. In the London Evening Standard on Friday the anti-war 
<br>
writer Will Self revealed that he had refused to speak on a platform 
<br>
with the MP. 'Anyone,' Self wrote, 'who had paid attention to 
<br>
Galloway's pro-Saddam statements should have realised that his 
<br>
motives for meddling in Iraqi politcs were far from humanitarian.' 
<br>
Anyone except Mark Seddon, Tariq Ali, Martin Rowson and a whole lot 
<br>
of others.
<br>
<p>Galloway was once a genuine critic of Saddam's. In the mid-1980s 
<br>
Hansard records him delivering a ferocious assault on the Baath 
<br>
regime, and those in the West who traded with and encouraged it. By 
<br>
1994, however, he was in Baghdad famously saluting Saddam's courage 
<br>
and indefatigability. He was soon a frequent flyer to Baghdad, and a 
<br>
reveller at Tariq Aziz's Yuletide festivities in 1999 (a fact which 
<br>
Galloway seemed to have forgotten last week, despite my having 
<br>
reminded him of it personally on a television programme in October 
<br>
2001).
<br>
<p>So why did George change? One of the reasons that I ended up 
<br>
supporting this war was that I agreed with Galloway back in the 
<br>
1980s, and Saddam never got any nicer, or less murderous. What 
<br>
happened?
<br>
<p>Leaving aside unproved accusations of personal gain, there are other 
<br>
explanations that might cover George's sudden blindness on the road 
<br>
to Baghdad. And the most obvious is that sin of the committed, the 
<br>
belief that my enemy's enemy is my friend. Or, in the context of the 
<br>
modern world, any anti-American will do. When Iraq stopped being a 
<br>
friend of the West it became a friend of George's.
<br>
<p>This is linked to a characteristic of much of the Left, which is a 
<br>
strangely cavalier attitude towards freedom and democracy. What, for 
<br>
example, should we make of this question from Tam Dalyell, asked in 
<br>
Parliament in 1998: 'Is an alternative to Saddam Hussein,' queried 
<br>
the man who has condemned Tony Blair as a war criminal, 'really 
<br>
preferable? How can we be sure that post-Saddam Iraq will not descend 
<br>
into civil war along religious and tribal lines - like the north of 
<br>
Iraq?'
<br>
<p>True, the same people will often shield themselves with one half 
<br>
sentence about Saddam's 'appaling human rights record'. But this is a 
<br>
phrase invoked as a defence against the reality of that record. 
<br>
Constructed against the reality of what it actually means to be 
<br>
living in such circumstances, afraid ever to speak. The constant 
<br>
suggestion is that the 'human rights record' is bad, but whatever the 
<br>
Americans do is far, far worse.
<br>
<p>The classical exponent of this technique is John Pilger. In last 
<br>
week's New Statesman one of his typical pieces about the corruption 
<br>
of most journalists (ie people like me) versus the bravery of a few 
<br>
(ie people like him), included an attack on my colleague, Andrew 
<br>
Rawnsley. Rawnsley was portrayed as a vulgar Government mouthpiece 
<br>
for having written that 'millions have died at the hands of Saddam'. 
<br>
But, Pilger objected, 'Amnesty produced a catalogue of Saddam's 
<br>
killings that amounted mostly to hundreds every year, not millions. 
<br>
It is an appaling record that does not require the exaggeration of 
<br>
state-inspired propaganda'.
<br>
<p>In fact Pilger's own source said (unquoted by him) that, in addition 
<br>
to the number of known executions Amnesty had also collected 
<br>
information on around 17,000 cases of disappearances, over the last 
<br>
20 years, and 'the real figure may be much higher'. Yes it may. Since 
<br>
the liberation, 993 corpses of executed people have been found at one 
<br>
cemetery alone, buried there over the last three years.
<br>
<p>But even that was not the point Rawnsley was making - 7,000 
<br>
communists were executed in the late 1970s. During the Anfal 
<br>
anti-Kurdish campaign in 1987 as many as 180,000 Kurds disappeared. 
<br>
At Halabja, in one incident alone, more people were killed than in 
<br>
the whole of this latest Gulf war. The most conservative death toll 
<br>
attached to the repression of the Shia uprising in 1991 was 30,000. 
<br>
One million died in the Iran-Iraq war started by Saddam.
<br>
<p>And this is reduced by Pilger to 'hundreds every year'. Not because 
<br>
of an innate hatred of hyperbole, because he has also written that 
<br>
'the current American elite is the Third Reich of our times'. Note, 
<br>
not the Roman Empire, nor yet the Ottoman Empire, but the Third Reich.
<br>
<p>All sins are American sins. Before the 1991 Gulf war, according to 
<br>
Pilger, Iraq was a 'relatively open and pro-Western society'. The 
<br>
health service was brill, education was fab, and - the 'appalling 
<br>
human rights record' aside - things were tickety-boo. Then came the 
<br>
war and sanctions and that led to repression and to economic misery. 
<br>
'With most Iraqis now dependent on the state food rationing system,' 
<br>
wrote Pilger, 'organised political dissent is all but unthinkable.' 
<br>
Whereas before sanctions it was entirely thinkable, providing you 
<br>
didn't mind being collected from the police station by your family 
<br>
(with a nominal charge for the hangman's time).
<br>
<p>And even this prelapsarian welfare paradise is a myth. The Iran-Iraq 
<br>
war lasted nearly a decade, and crippled the Iraqi economy. Some $35 
<br>
billion of reserves became a debt of $46bn. Kuwait was invaded 
<br>
precisely because Iraq had gone bust, and the invasion made things 
<br>
worse. So did sanctions, but when Oil for Food came in 1995, what did 
<br>
Saddam spend the money on? You've seen the palaces on television, so 
<br>
you know.
<br>
<p>A year ago one of those international peace delegations went to 
<br>
Baghdad. According to Agence France-Presse they had a march in the 
<br>
city, holding banners saying, 'No to sanctions, no to war', and 
<br>
'Palestine is Arab, down with Zionism'. Among them was a 
<br>
white-bearded New Zealand Quaker called Tony Maturin. When he 
<br>
returned from Iraq he gave an interview on a local radio station. One 
<br>
part went like this:
<br>
<p>Interviewer: 'And did the people you spoke with indicate they felt 
<br>
free to tell you anything they wanted to?'
<br>
<p>Maturin: 'I didn't ask them that. I didn't ask them that because I 
<br>
know very well that that government has a horrendous human rights 
<br>
record. What we don't know, they're also a very benevolent government 
<br>
as far as the country goes. They've done tremendous things for that 
<br>
country. And the people I spoke to, they all say, &quot;If they bomb us 
<br>
again we'll rebuild again. And we have a country that our government 
<br>
is doing their best to make a strong country again.&quot;'
<br>
<p>Stupid man.
