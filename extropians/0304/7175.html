</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;More nutrient-dense&quot;, yes.  &quot;Healthier&quot; is what's being argued.
</em><br>
<p>To me these terms are virtually synonymous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can one get too many nutrients? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes if one adds massive amounts of certain vitamin or mineral supplements.
<br>
Vitamins A and E for example are toxic if you swallow too many A and E pills
<br>
every day over an extended period. 
<br>
<p>It is however almost impossible for a normal person to suffer from too many
<br>
vitamins or minerals from eating a balanced unsupplemented natural diet,
<br>
whether it be paleo or otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there harm from having to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with too much of some stuff?  Certainly I've seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worries about too much protein -- gout, calcium interference,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kidney stones.  
</em><br>
<p>If one eats only lean meat for awhile then one might have some problems, but
<br>
that is not the paleodiet. Dr. Cordain recommends something like 30% of
<br>
calories from protein -- not a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And even if they're not harmful, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial effects level off?  Once one has enough nutrients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is there any harm to capping off the calories with 'empty'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (clean-burning?) (cheaper) calories?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I understand this question, but if it's about protein then in
<br>
principle yes one should not eat much more than one really needs. The excess
<br>
protein can be turned into glucose to meet energy needs in a process called
<br>
gluconeogenesis, in which case one might just have well have consumed those
<br>
calories from less expensive sources like fruits and veggies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, see the Okinawans.  Insofar as the paleodieters are calling for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elimination of the cheap calories, even after other concerns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are met, I think they're making a strong, and weakly-supported, claim.
</em><br>
<p>I note that the Okinawans also practice caloric restriction as a matter of
<br>
course. It is common for them to deliberately stop eating when they feel
<br>
they are about 80% full. This practice alone could increase their longevity
<br>
irrespective of diet. 
<br>
<p>Paleodiet theory has nothing directly to say about CR, though one could
<br>
surmise that CR was often an involuntary necessity of paleolithic life.
