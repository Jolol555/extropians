<em>&gt; &gt; Now [warming] could be abstractly beneficial, in the way that having legacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; industrial plant bombed out of existence can give the next generation a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quick leg up. But people don't usually welcome the kinds of droughts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; floods that are currently afflicting Australia, for example, no matter how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bracing for their character and how much it unsettles the encrusted order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, it's not warming so much as abrupt (relatively) change that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people don't like. The &quot;news&quot; in the original piece isn't news to historians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and BTW the data is about as robust as historical evidence ever gets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite what some scientists would have you believe). What the record shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that climate change is good news for some, bad for others. So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medieval Climate Optimum was pretty good if you were a Viking but disastrous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Dutchmen as it led to the huge flood in the 12th century that drowned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two thirds of the low countries and created the Zuyder Zee (much of which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still there).
</em><br>
<p>How quickly did the inundation occur?  I'm wondering if it would
<br>
be quite easy for the Dutch today to prevent something similar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not a lot anyone can do to prevent this though. Florida real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estate doesn't look like a good bet to me if you look back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just 80 years to the weather it experienced in the 1920s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it had a series of huge hurricanes.  Not so many condos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hotels back then.
</em><br>
<p>Well, why not ;-)  Just get the government to declare it a
<br>
disaster area, and the owners don't really run any risk.
<br>
<p>Putting aside hurricanes for a moment, and assuming that all
<br>
of Florida gets privately owned, then could the rise in sea
<br>
level be so slow as to permit owners to build walls to hold
<br>
back the sea?
