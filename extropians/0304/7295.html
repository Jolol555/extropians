<a href="mailto:mwiik@messagenet.com?Subject=Re:%20[WAR]:%20not%20about%20WMD">mwiik@messagenet.com</a> writes: I agree totally. If Iraq posed an immediate 
<br>
threat to us we would have been within our rights to attack. What this thread 
<br>
is about, is that the statements about such a threat coming from the 
<br>
administration were a tissue of lies.
<br>
<p>Mike,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that you would like to have this thread be about the 
<br>
administration having constructed a tissue of lies as an excuse to attack 
<br>
Iraq.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I have two contrary points of belief:
<br>
1.  The is and was sufficient reason to believe, going into the war, that the 
<br>
Iraqi had weapons of mass distruction and were threatening to use them.
<br>
2.  That the attempt to claim there was no proof nor threat to use WMDs is 
<br>
itself a lie spread to bring dishonor or worse upon the US.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing difficult to discern is who is a prime mover on your 
<br>
side and who is merely deluded.
<br>

<br>
<p><p>You asked rhetorically, &quot;Is it over? Is it official? In any case the debate 
<br>
is far from over. I expect we'll see other columns (like a recent one in the 
<br>
LA Times) calling for impeachment unless WMD's are found.&quot;
<br>
#No it is not over, it is part of your agenda to prove that the US did some 
<br>
dastardly thing.  No, matter how often proven you will still be there beating 
<br>
your little tin drum and trying to drum the same old points home.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike Lorry wrote, &quot;Latest news on CNN is that, 40 miles north of 
<br>
Tikrit, a missile site has been found with mobile labs, dozens of drums 
<br>
containing blister and nerve agents, all protected behind berms, along with 
<br>
documents and the highest quality gas masks available.&quot;
<br>
#Mike has made a very cogent point but the point will prove useless.  No 
<br>
matter how well he makes the point you will retreat to a back up position and 
<br>
keep beating your drum.
<br>
The you continued, &quot;Nonetheless, to me one of the greatest things about 
<br>
americans is that they don't maintain hatreds for very long. If only the rest 
<br>
of the world was as forgiving.&quot;
<br>
#No, the rest of the world believes what was reported by reporters bought and 
<br>
paid for by Sadaam.  The rest of the world believes British MPs paid for by 
<br>
Sadaam.  The rest of the world will listen to you.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand the polls indicate that a large majority of the 
<br>
American population does not believe you, neither do I.
