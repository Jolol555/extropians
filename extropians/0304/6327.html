</em><br>
<p>And from another post you wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The cultures that come immediately to my mind when I think of getting a
</em><br>
large % 
<br>
<em>&gt; of calories from meat are the various groups collectively known as Eskimo
</em><br>
people. 
<br>
<em>&gt; Here's what a quick search...
</em><br>
<p>You seem to be forgetting that North American people, including Eskimos, are
<br>
not truly Paleolithic. Homo did not appear on the American continents until
<br>
roughly 10 to 15 thousand years ago. That's just yesterday in terms of human
<br>
evolution. 
<br>
<p>It is very common for cultural anthropologists, (from whom I suppose you may
<br>
be drawing much of your argument, directly or indirectly), to look at
<br>
supposed primitive cultures currently alive on the western continents and
<br>
then to draw mistaken inferences about our Paleolithic pasts in Europe and
<br>
Africa. 
<br>
<p>As for hunting being unlikely because it's difficult without a gun, well,
<br>
that's just plain silly. Humans have been spearing animals with arrows and
<br>
spears for eons. In some cases it took a group effort by much or all the
<br>
tribe, as for example in the hunt for the mastodon, (the elephant's terrific
<br>
and extinct cousin). But a single mastodon could feed a tribe for a month.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One more point about the diets of hunter-gatherers: most wild game is far
</em><br>
leaner
<br>
<em>&gt; than domestically raised meat. 
</em><br>
<p>On this much we can agree.
