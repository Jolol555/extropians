<p>Since this article addresses two of my leading interests, space and
<br>
China, I read it with great interest.  Although Sterling notes that
<br>
there is almost too much of a gap between China and India for there to
<br>
be a &quot;race&quot; per se (greater, I think, than the gap between Russia and
<br>
the U.S. in say 1960), he makes a good point that both countries have an
<br>
impetus to develop the technologies necessary and each perceives the
<br>
other as a strategic rival, thus creating the premises for a &quot;race.&quot;
<br>
<p>I see the more interesting, and potentially fruitful, space rivalry as
<br>
being between China and the U.S.  It's a near-certainty that the Chinese
<br>
will launch their first manned spacecraft this year, probably in
<br>
October.  They're more ready than either Russia or the U.S. were when
<br>
they made their first manned launches, and the new government NEEDS a
<br>
dramatic piece of positive, nationalistically-reinforcing news.  The
<br>
conditions for fairly rapid progress in the Chinese space program from
<br>
now on are very good: China's got lots of cash, there's broad and deep
<br>
support for the program throughout Chinese society, and the
<br>
technological conditions are excellent.  In this regard, I don't think
<br>
India comes even close to having the same conditions for progress as
<br>
China.
<br>
<p>No, the real target for a &quot;Chinese space race&quot; is the U.S.  And I think
<br>
this is a GREAT thing, since it could provide the same kind of spur to
<br>
both sides that the Cold War rivalry did in the 1950s-1970s.  The hunger
<br>
for a globally-visible affirmation that China has &quot;arrived&quot; on the world
<br>
stage is nearly universal in that country, and this impetus provides a
<br>
deep reservoir of support to achieve the Chinese space program's stated
<br>
goal, which is the establishment of a permanently manned base on the
<br>
moon within the next twenty years.
<br>
<p>Beyond (or beside) this, I see a potentially very favorable development
<br>
in the possibility of inviting the Chinese to participate in the ISS
<br>
program.  Since the Shenzhou spacecraft is just an updated Soyuz, it
<br>
ought to be maximally compatible with the Russian elements of the
<br>
station.  Here's my dream: The Russians carry through with their deal to
<br>
begin launching from the ESA equatorial launch facility in South
<br>
America, so the station can be slowly moved to a more reasonably aligned
<br>
orbit.  Meanwhile, the Chinese begin to provide ferry and lifeboat
<br>
service with Shenzhou flights, while at the same time working on a
<br>
unilateral lunar program.  Wouldn't that be great?!?!
