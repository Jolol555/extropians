Dear Extropes/Transhumans:
<br>
<p>Last Monday evening, I had the pleasure to visit a place near Milton
<br>
Keyes, England called: Bletchley Park. I was with a group of ten
<br>
people from my ESA Earth dust/debris project working group.  Our
<br>
formal meeting took place in Milton Keynes during Monday and Tuesday
<br>
and so Monday evening was our social evening night out, hosted by
<br>
the Planetary Sciences department at Open University, and the
<br>
company: Unispace Kent.
<br>
<p>Bletchley Park
<br>
<a href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk">http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk</a>
<br>
<p>This was one of the most interesting places I have ever visited, and
<br>
I recommend that, if ever you are within a couple hundred kilometers
<br>
of London, set aside _at least_ one day and devour this place.
<br>
<p>Bletchley Park was the place that, during WWII, the German military
<br>
cypher machine ENIGMA was studied and methods devised to enable the
<br>
Allied forces to to decipher secret communications. It was also here
<br>
that the early important research and design and implementation
<br>
(Alan Turing's direction) for the world's first computer: the
<br>
Colossus took place.
<br>
<p>Bletchley Park is an elaborate museum now, spanning many acres and
<br>
buildings demonstrating every aspect about cryptography. With
<br>
regards to the machines designed: there are replicas, some working
<br>
replicas too (A working &quot;Bombe&quot; that is a copy of that built by
<br>
Turing to decipher the ENIGMA will be ready by the end of this year
<br>
the lecturer told us, and one can already try out a German 60 year
<br>
old ENIGMA machine.)
<br>
<p>What is the ENIGMA machine?  You can see pictures and read some
<br>
text here:
<br>
<p>The ENIGMA machine
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;From September 1938, Alan Turing gave part-time assistance to the
<br>
British cryptanalytic organisation, the Government Code and Cypher
<br>
School to break code produced by the ENIGMA machine. Their work was
<br>
transformed by the transfer of information from Polish mathematical
<br>
cryptanalysts in July 1939. From 4 September 1939, Turing worked
<br>
full-time at the GC&amp;CS war-time headquarters, Bletchley Park.
<br>
<p>I've never been a 'war buff', but I'm a physicist, and seeing parts
<br>
of the electro-mechanical machines with dozens of rotors, running
<br>
through sequences of letters to break codes tickled me to no end. In
<br>
addition, one learns about the human elements- how the scientists at
<br>
Bletchley Park took advantage of mistakes made by the code senders-
<br>
for example: forgetting to reset the rotors to their initial
<br>
positions, noticing significant words, hearing how the Italian
<br>
pilots regularly goofed with the German ENIGMA machines given to
<br>
them, which helped the codebreakers more, added dimensions to the
<br>
story. In addition, and even more tickling of my fancy: Bletchley
<br>
Park was indeed, where the beginnings of the computer took place,
<br>
that is, the results of Turing's work. Turing's first computer
<br>
design during the war was implemented with 1920s parts from the
<br>
British Telegraph company. It only required the right people being
<br>
together at the right time to put the already existing know-how
<br>
together, and we have our first electromechanical computer.
<br>
<p>A regular tour takes about 4 or 5 hours (our dust/debris group got
<br>
the 'condensed version' and all of us want to return), and I think
<br>
that you won't regret spending the full day there. More than enough
<br>
material to see and to learn.
