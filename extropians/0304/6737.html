<p>I don't doubt that for a minute. In fact I've been arguing that this is in
<br>
fact what occurred, and that the extinction of species gave impetus to the
<br>
agricultural revolution. 
<br>
<p>But how is it evidence of a &quot;destructive tendency&quot; in animals or paleo
<br>
humans who knew no better? They were merely trying to feed themselves. Only
<br>
in the last half-century or so have any humans even bothered to think about
<br>
preserving species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For corroborating data see Stephen Pinker's _The Blank Slate_
</em><br>
<p>I have Pinker's book right here on my computer desk, and from scanning it I
<br>
know the basic theme, though I haven't yet had time to read it thoroughly.
<br>
I'm not trying to argue for the Noble Savage. I'm merely pointing out that I
<br>
think Diamond is wrong if he thinks over-hunting is evidence of a
<br>
destructive tendency in paleo humans. Dropping napalm on the Vietnamese
<br>
might constitute such evidence, but naively over-hunting a species in an
<br>
effort to feed oneself? Where is the logic in that, mez?
<br>
<p>Currently I'm reading an excellent little book called _Dawkins vs Gould:
<br>
Survival of the Fittest_. I'm trying to understand the details of their long
<br>
and sometimes heated debate about the finer points of evolution theory.
