<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coming from a place where homeschooling doesn't exist (and private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools were reintroduced just a few years ago), I have always wondered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the practicalities of homeschooling. Is the idea that the parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act as teachers, and give their children materials to read and explore?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^While I have never met any homeschoolers, I have seen TV specials on
<br>
the topic. Some parents are stay at home full time teachers for their
<br>
children. Some people form little groups of homeschool families, and some
<br>
parents in the group teach some subjects. For my family, I am hoping to have
<br>
time to do a lot myself, but also hoping to have my brothers help. One
<br>
brother is a mathematician and the other is a musician. I don't know if that
<br>
help will happen though, since right now we live very far apart.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; While this sounds wonderful, it also seems to be extremely demanding on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their time and capacity if they are working.
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^^ Extremely demanding. Extremely rewarding as well. One reward is
<br>
knowing that I will be saving my children from the boredom and tyranny of
<br>
public schools that my brother and I suffered in for years. Another reward
<br>
is having so much time getting to know my child, and learning things with my
<br>
child. The final reward is having the child learn to think for themselves
<br>
and make their own way in the world.
