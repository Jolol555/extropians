</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It's a point of ideology. The notion is anyone willing to work a 40
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hour week, to contribute meaningfully to the well being of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  broader community, is entitled to a subsistence standard of living
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and a measure of basic human dignity. That entitlement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent of the amount of value one actually produces, and it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  more important that the system be approximately just than perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient.
</em><br>
<p>It also is a principle of natural law, as well. Man, in a state of
<br>
nature, generally had to work x hours a day to satisfy his needs (of
<br>
course, this varied by climate, local ecology, etc). If a society is
<br>
based on natural law, as ours is, and as libertarian principle is, it
<br>
should regard such a number of hours as a standard average work week
<br>
for an average standard of living, independent of technological
<br>
development or local resource availability. 
<br>
<p>As I stated in a recent post, I earn approximatly in the 48% level at
<br>
the present time. Does my standard of living reflect this, though? No,
<br>
it doesn't. My current housing is significantly substandard, yet I am
<br>
paying the same amount I paid two years ago for a decent two bedroom
<br>
apartment. I am paying approximately the percent of my income for
<br>
housing that financial counselors would recommend one should pay for
<br>
housing.
<br>
<p>Now, my local economy is being significantly distorted by governmental
<br>
policies, specifically an anti-family housing policy that has severely
<br>
restricted the development of housing available for non-senior citizens
<br>
who are not high-income earners. They are giving property tax
<br>
exemptions to senior owned or occupied housing, while jacking up
<br>
property taxes on everyone else to pay for increased education costs
<br>
(even those of us without kids). They are blocking approval of family
<br>
oriented housing developments and zoning amendments to make housing
<br>
more affordable.
<br>
<p>In a community of 13,000 people, there is a housing deficit of 1800
<br>
units. Those that can't afford it are being economically exiled. It is
<br>
ethnic cleansing by economics rather than by death squads. Long time
<br>
residents are being forced out to the hinterlands while the town is
<br>
taken over by white collar, highly educated professional transplants
<br>
from elsewhere who are turning the entire town into a country club.
<br>
Everyone else being forced out makes up the body of the local
<br>
workforce, anybody who is not a doctor or college professor, etc.
<br>
<p>I am tempted at changing the welcome sign to the city to &quot;Welcome to
<br>
the Lebanon Country Club, servants enter via Rte 4 only&quot;.
<br>
<p>At the same time that local cost of living is increasing due to housing
<br>
policy, incomes remain at levels below even national averages for any
<br>
but the upper echelons, yet employers have difficulty filling slots,
<br>
and either outsource to other regions, or import low wage labor that
<br>
increases pressure on local resources. Employees face ever longer
<br>
commutes with no improvement to roads.
<br>
<p>Lebanon was ranked the second most livable small town seven years ago.
<br>
Today it is accelerating toward a status as a socio-economic battle zone.
