<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Generally, trying to do good with other people's money is a bad idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Helping the poor can be achieved by less dishonest means, such as
</em><br>
offering
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; employers subsidies to hire workers, e.g., by matching every 1$/hour in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paid with 1$ in subsidy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whose money would you be using to bankroll the subsidy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The rest of your argument makes sense, but it looks to me as though you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using other people's money in both of your hypothetical cases.
</em><br>
<p>### You are correct, subsidizing wages from flat tax is still playing with
<br>
other people's money, but it is all a matter of degree. Minimum wage laws
<br>
mean there is hardly any overlap between the decisionmaker
<br>
(voter/legislator), and the payer (the business employing poor people). The
<br>
majority which enacts the law doesn't pay directly, only a minority does, so
<br>
for the average voter, almost all the money transferred due to his decision
<br>
will be somebody else's money. Of course, sooner or later the cost will get
<br>
spread over most of the society, but very indirectly, so most decisionmakers
<br>
will never become aware of the cost of their decisions.
<br>
<p>In the wage subsidy, every decisionmaker in the majority which enacts a
<br>
subsidy law, has to transfer voluntarily a portion of his/her own funds, no
<br>
less than the funds transferred from the average member of a minority who
<br>
might oppose the subsidy. As a result, only a fraction, specifically, less
<br>
than 50% of the transfer, is other people's money taken against their vote.
<br>
This is still not perfectly honest, like private charity would be, but it is
<br>
a step in the right direction.
