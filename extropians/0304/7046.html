</em><br>

<em>&gt; use).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there are the plastic consumables -- tubes or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which to grow you modified organisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It isn't cheap.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Correct me if I'm wrong, please, but none of the
<br>
above sounds fundamentally difficult to manufacture.
<br>
Which means, in theory, if one had a large marget of
<br>
would-be genetic engineers, one could set up efficient
<br>
mass production of all of these components, especially
<br>
the consumables and enzymes.  The main reason they
<br>
cost so much now is that the effort to set up initial
<br>
manufacturing has to be amortized among a limited set
<br>
of customers.
<br>
<p>In other words, it's the kind of problem that
<br>
historically has naturally been solved as the skill
<br>
base necessary to use this gets more and more widely
<br>
disseminated, thus creating more customers for all of
<br>
this.  The problem is that it isn't cheap *right now*.
<br>
Is this correct?
<br>
<p>If so, then it would seem one of the more efficient
<br>
ways to solve the problem would be to document some
<br>
simple examples of the type of engineering you'd like
<br>
to make cheap - basically, recipes that others could
<br>
follow - and give them away.  This will, by itself,
<br>
create the larger demand.  It would take quite a lot
<br>
of recipies to have noticable impact, though: a mere
<br>
thousand extra customers, especially as a one-shot,
<br>
would likely make little difference in the prices.
<br>
But perhaps if one could then buy the machinery,
<br>
consumables, etc. for these recipies in bulk - at bulk
<br>
discount - then pass some of the savings along as a
<br>
reseller to those interested in following the
<br>
recipies?  I believe this model has been successfully
<br>
followed in certain other industries, ending when the
<br>
recipies produced enough general-use customers that
<br>
the manufacturers clued in and became their own bulk
<br>
customers, or ossifying into distributor chains (as
<br>
seen with, for instance, modern supermarkets).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Might it not be simpler just to design a virus to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this infection, but not replicate (beyond normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cell division, et cetera), then flood the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a lot of this virus?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This involves placing the virus in a host which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineered to have the required additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machinery -- not simple (otherwise how do you get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient number of viruses?).
</em><br>
<p>Good point.  One could, say, engineer or find a host
<br>
optimized for replication of virii; this would be a
<br>
significant cost, but one-time.  Again, amortize over
<br>
a number of different applications; stocks of this
<br>
cell (&quot;blank&quot; - that is, ready for infection) could
<br>
become one of the consumables in the above business
<br>
model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem that you don't introduce any of the cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are capable of replicating the virus.
</em><br>
<p>Typical virii are much smaller than typical cells, no?
<br>
So, would it be possible to pass the solution,
<br>
containing both virus and cells, through a filter with
<br>
small enough pores that only the virus could fit
<br>
through?  You'd wind up with virus on one side, and
<br>
virus plus cells on the other; discard the latter (or
<br>
save for processing more batches) and use the former.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; One challenge would be how to make sure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; virus does not needlessly overwrite the edit on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that has already been modified, or at least that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an overwrite would be harmless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes -- this is the &quot;How many copies do you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are some solutions for this in prokaryotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with bacterial viruses but I'm unaware of any that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within eukaryotic cells.  With their much larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be difficult for the regulatory proteins to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diffuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently fast to perform the desired function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulating copy number).
</em><br>
<p>If limiting copies/overwrites would be difficult, then
<br>
perhaps it might be easier to ensure that overwrites
<br>
would be harmless?  Say, design the virii such that,
<br>
if one infects an already infected cell, it will
<br>
merely knock out the previous copy and replace it.
<br>
(Which is why I use the term &quot;overwrite&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've thought about this for a long time and haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managed to come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a good solution (which is why I suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delivering single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-engineered secondary nuclei [biobots] outside of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the body). One can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always screen such cells to make sure you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting those with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct modifications. Inside the body it is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more difficult to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure things are going as planned.
</em><br>
<p>True, but then you face the problem of integrating
<br>
these secondary nuclei into existing cells, putting
<br>
only one secondary nuclei into each cell instead of
<br>
multiple in one cell and none in its neighbors, making
<br>
sure they divide when they rest of the cell divides,
<br>
et cetera.  It seems, on first glance, that by the
<br>
time you solve those problems you'd wind up with
<br>
something very much like a non-self-reproducing virus
<br>
anyway.
