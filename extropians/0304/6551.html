Dont panick !!!! or do?
<br>
<p>An article in a local newspaper gave me cause for concern regarding SARS.
<br>
The article stated that a young boy had been admitted to the local A and E 
<br>
with a dry cough and high fever. He tested negative to all the usual tests, 
<br>
yet sadly died shortly after. The headline was something like 'mystery 
<br>
illness kills local boy' and the Hospital had been unable to determine the 
<br>
cause.
<br>
The article was published about a month ago, before any reported cases of 
<br>
SARS in the UK, So although I was understandably concerned, it didn't worry 
<br>
me enough to post anything about it. The reason I am posting now is due to 
<br>
something that happened today.
<br>
<p>My best friends son developed a similar illness about a week after that of 
<br>
the boy. Due to close contact with my friends son. Both I, My friend My wife 
<br>
and My youngest daughter also developed what could be described as flu like 
<br>
symptoms. This is no supprise really as 'There is alot of it about' in the 
<br>
area and it seems that just about everyone has been ill on and off for 
<br>
months. There is many people that are saying 'I just cant seem to shake it' I 
<br>
was more concerned when I talked to my friend about SARS and if he had seen 
<br>
the article. Not only had he seen it, His son was in the same class as the 
<br>
boy that had died.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
At about this point the alarm bells started ringing, but didn't unduely 
<br>
concern me, as people get colds and flu all the time, especially from there 
<br>
kids. What did concern me was that today I picked up my friend and his family 
<br>
from the airport after there holiday. I was worried to hear his son still 
<br>
coughing away like he had been smoking 60 a day. I then realised that I and 
<br>
my family are also still not fully recovered from illness, If anything my 
<br>
wife appears to be getting worse. She visited her GP last week and told him 
<br>
her symptoms which read like either that of SARS or Flu. He prescribed a 
<br>
short course of antibiotics. (Hmmmmmm.....Antibiotics?....Virus)
<br>
Just for info, we live around 25 miles north of London, where there has been 
<br>
3 reported cases so far with local transmission. A large percentage of the 
<br>
local populus commute to London daily.
<br>
<p>So is it time to start panicking yet ? I'm still not sure. More than likely 
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>All this is very coincidental and is based on the tragic death of a local 
<br>
child that may have had nothing to do with SARS. This little local chain of 
<br>
events has highlighted several problems to me.
<br>
When do you start to panick, or start to take serious precautions?
<br>
In the current state of health alerts, shouldn't GP's er on the side of 
<br>
caution and at least order a few tests? Especially in a case like this where 
<br>
there is a close degree of seperation between an unexplained death and 
<br>
someone reporting similar symptoms.
<br>
<p>The whole episode has made me wonder about how we always playing catch up in 
<br>
epidemic type situations. There seems to be very little prevention or caution 
<br>
involved.
<br>
It makes you think about how easy it is for a major epidemic to start, just 
<br>
because the relevent people can't see all the pieces of the puzzle forming 
<br>
until it is too late.
<br>
<p>Alex (Still coughing and feeling like crap)
