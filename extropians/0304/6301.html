<p>I'm not either.
<br>
<p>Also, I'm not sure that the human digestive is ideal for high-protein,
<br>
low-carb diets. When it was evolving, humans and their predecessors would
<br>
have eaten mostly fruit, leaves, roots, seeds, insects, bird eggs, and small
<br>
reptiles and mammals. Although most insects are high in protein, I don't
<br>
think there are enough palatable and easy-to-catch ones that they could have
<br>
been the main part of the pre-human and early human diet. From the
<br>
archaeological evidence I've seen, humans didn't become successful enough
<br>
hunters to rely on meat for a large % of their calories until relatively
<br>
recently.
<br>
<p>As for leaving the carbs out of the diet, I agree completely that refined
<br>
carbs such as sugar, honey, and white flour are not healthy. But fruits,
<br>
tubers (such as sweet potatoes and taro), and seeds (such as whole wheat and
<br>
corn -- although, as someone pointed out, one might wish to eat these
<br>
sparingly) would have been the main ingredients of the pre-human and early
<br>
human diet.
