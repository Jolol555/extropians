<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You're supposed to MOVE from point A to point B, not COPY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself from point A to point B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What the hell is the difference?  (Except that copying is non-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destructive, whereas moving is.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ahhh, the old argument returns...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Other people want to preserve some attributes of themselves.  Destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copying makes sure that those attributes exist somewhere else when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original dies.  Therefore their desired attributes are preserved and avoids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the destruction.  The surviving attributes are exactly the same whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a copy or not.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the position I adopt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;What is the difference?&quot;  Semantics, I think.
</em><br>
<p>I agree literally with that, at least in the sense that to
<br>
(a) remain alive without undergoing copying
<br>
(b) to be copied and the original simultaneously destroyed
<br>
differ only semantically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Each side of the debate has different goals for what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are trying to achieve.  They all call their various goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the same label of &quot;survival&quot;, which confuses us into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming that there is one answer...
</em><br>
<p>I'm stubbornly still claiming that there is an answer.
<br>
To get your arm broken harms you a lot more than being
<br>
destructively teleported.  Moreover, if someone had
<br>
ten experiences of that, I'm sure that he or she would
<br>
come around to agreeing with me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The pro-destructive-copy people compare the before and after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies as being identical and can't see any difference to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make them change their mind.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  And, as I'll explain in a minute, I think that
<br>
the real difference boils down to your theory of physics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The anti-destructive-people compare the dead person in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the copy scenario with the dead person in the non-copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario, and can't see any difference to make them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change their mind.  Both are correct in their viewpoint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their own goals, and no argument for a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure that doesn't meet their goals will change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their mind.  Only changing their criteria goals will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince anybody to change their mind.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you're right ;-) but I doubt that I will ever stop
<br>
trying.
<br>
<p>Now if physics is all there is---that is, there are no
<br>
souls or essences---then all you are is determined by
<br>
the arrangement of your molecules.  But now the phone
<br>
rings, and your molecules go into a different configuration.
<br>
Do you still live?
<br>
<p>Of course you still live.  But the reason is exactly that
<br>
the transformation has *not* altered your state enough to
<br>
make you a different person.
<br>
<p>Well, then, if you are teleported somewhere, you obtain
<br>
*exactly* the state (up to quantum indistinguishability,
<br>
i.e., not including quantum indistinguishability), that
<br>
is, you go into a state that vastly closer resembles the
<br>
state you were in before the phone rang.
<br>
<p>Thus if one believes deeply enough in standard physics,
<br>
i.e., that we're just atoms, nothing more, then one will
<br>
not object to teleportation (wherein one's information
<br>
is transmitted to a remote locality to animate remote
<br>
atoms and one's local set of atoms is discarded).
<br>
<p>But the clincher would come if teleportation were to become
<br>
a technological reality.  Not many years would pass before
<br>
everyone &quot;adjusted&quot; their philosophy to the new reality.
<br>
