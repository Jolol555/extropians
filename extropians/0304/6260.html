From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20IRAQ:%20Predictable%20catastrophes%20of%20human%20stupidity">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm continually appalled at the negative &quot;cult of personality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list.  Evidently most people think that Bush runs the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government entirely on his own ...  No matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how many times the entrenched bureaucrats in the various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; departments are referred to, nor no matter how many times the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president's advisors (Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, etc.) and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staffs are referred to, it just doesn't matter:  the refrain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is always the same:  George Bush doesn't have the I.Q. to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the job (whether it's &quot;managing&quot; the economy, or &quot;conducting&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign affairs).
</em><br>
<p>All right, Lee, who in the Bush administration do you consider to be (even a
<br>
little bit) extropian?  Rumsfeld?  Rice? Powell? Cheney? Ashcroft? DeLay?
<br>
<p>Neither Bush's I.Q. nor the respective I.Q.s of members of his
<br>
administration worry me as much as the fact that *all* those combined I.Q.s
<br>
cannot seem to leap over the wall of faith.  And that faith - and not
<br>
secular geopolitics or reason - is really in the driver's seat &quot;managing&quot;
<br>
the economy and &quot;conducting&quot; foreign affairs.
<br>
<p>Here are some excerpts from Lewis Lapham's Notebook in the current (May
<br>
2003) issue of Harper's:
<br>
<p>&quot;... even the British choose not to notice that Jehovah is alive and well
<br>
and often angry not only in Texas and Tennessee but also in the halls of
<br>
Congress.  Our national opinion polls report 46 percent of the respondents
<br>
registering themselves - together with President George W. Bush - as
<br>
evangelical Christians, twice born and therefore safe within the garden of
<br>
redemption; 48 percent denying as heresy the theory of evolution; another 68
<br>
percent knowing that it has met or seen the Devil.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Attorney General John Ashcroft asserts that in the United States 'we have
<br>
no king but Jesus,' and Tom DeLay, the Republican majority leader in the
<br>
House of Representatives, says that he has been assigned by God to promote
<br>
'a biblical worldview' in American politics, that 'only Christianity offers
<br>
a way to live in response to the realities that we find in this world - only
<br>
Christianity.'&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;When President Bush appeared in the White House on the evening of March 6
<br>
to announce the imminent scouring of Iraq, it was a wonder he didn't speak
<br>
in tongues.  His topic was geopolitical, but his message was religious, the
<br>
blank expression engraved on his face disquietingly similar to the
<br>
thousand-yard stare of the true believer gazing into the mirror of
<br>
eternity.&quot;
<br>
<p>And Lapham quotes George Bush (there are many more such gems in the
<br>
article):
<br>
<p>&quot;The liberty we prize is not America's gift to the world, it is God's gift
<br>
to humanity.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We will export death and violence to the four corners of the earth in
<br>
defense of our great nation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Towards the end of the article Lapham writes (Extropians read this and
<br>
weep):
<br>
<p>&quot;President Bush speaks for an earlier period in American history, from a
<br>
pulpit in the Puritan forest before it received the gift of books.  If his
<br>
biographers can be trusted, we now have in the White House a president so
<br>
secure in his belief that the course of human events rests in 'the hand of a
<br>
just and faithful God' that he counts his ignorance as a virtue and regards
<br>
his lack of curiosity as a sign of moral strength.  A similarly primitive
<br>
way of thinking (fearful, intolerant, fond of magic) darkens the mind of the
<br>
shamans drawing up the Pentagon's plans for the conquest of evil and
<br>
accounts for the punitive reign of virtue currently being imposed upon the
<br>
American body politic by the Justice Department, the Congress, and the
<br>
Supreme Court.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Our Washington geopoliticians like to imagine their war on terrorism as 'a
<br>
clash of civilizations.'  They flatter themselves with the high-toned noun;
<br>
what they have incompetently in hand is a clash of superstitions ...&quot;
<br>
<p>Scary stuff, IMO ...
