You would say so anyway, since I'm socially liberal and disagree with
<br>
both the intent and execution of the U.S.' foreign policy.  So I hardly
<br>
find this insulting or, really, even significant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ayatollahs and their police,=20
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Yes, they are.  The Savama are the same organization as the SAVAK,
<br>
who the CIA trained in the 50's and 60's.  The CIA toppled Mossadegh in
<br>
1953 and put the first Shah in power, in spite (and because) of the fact
<br>
that Mossadegh's popular support in Iran was almost ironclad.  When he
<br>
tried to nationalize oil production, we just wouldn't put up with it.
<br>
Homeboy had to go.
<br>
<p>The US doesn't tolerate democracy or stability in strategically critical
<br>
areas of the world.  We prefer to install violent, dictatorial madmen
<br>
who (we believe) we can control, thus keeping our hands nominally free
<br>
of the blood of the populace.
<br>
<p>But, as we approach the &quot;Singularity&quot; (still not clear on what that is,
<br>
exactly, or what form people on the list expect it to take), the density
<br>
of information is getting such that people with a clear head can't be
<br>
fooled into thinking that this isn't what's going on anymore.
<br>
<p>Welcome to the conclusion of empire...
