This is an abstract of an article SB Eaton. Dr Eaton is responsible for
<br>
having generated the current interest in paleolithic diets, having been the
<br>
first to study them and report their health benefits in 1985 in the New
<br>
England Journal of Medicine (unfortunately that abstract does seem to be
<br>
available in the Medline database). Since 1985 other researchers have
<br>
collaborated with Eaton and further developed his ideas (e.g., Dr. Loren
<br>
Cordain of Colorado State, quoted by me a couple of days ago in the diet and
<br>
exercise thread). -gts

The nutritional patterns of Paleolithic humans influenced genetic evolution
<br>
during the time segment within which defining characteristics of
<br>
contemporary humans were selected. Our genome can have changed little since
<br>
the beginnings of agriculture, so, genetically, humans remain Stone
<br>
Agers--adapted for a Paleolithic dietary regimen. Such diets were based
<br>
chiefly on wild game, fish and uncultivated plant foods. They provided
<br>
abundant protein; a fat profile much different from that of affluent Western
<br>
nations; high fibre; carbohydrate from fruits and vegetables (and some
<br>
honey) but not from cereals, refined sugars and dairy products; high levels
<br>
of micronutrients and probably of phytochemicals as well. Differences
<br>
between contemporary and ancestral diets have many pathophysiological
<br>
implications. This review addresses phytochemicals and cancer; calcium,
<br>
physical exertion, bone mineral density and bone structural geometry;
<br>
dietary protein, potassium, renal acid secretion and urinary calcium loss;
<br>
and finally sarcopenia, adiposity, insulin receptors and insulin resistance.
<br>
While not, yet, a basis for formal recommendations, awareness of Paleolithic
<br>
nutritional patterns should generate novel, testable hypotheses grounded in
<br>
evolutionary theory and it should dispel complacency regarding currently
<br>
accepted nutritional tenets.
