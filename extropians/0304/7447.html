<p>
What follows is a response to my forwarding a link to
<br>
my recent posts here to David Brin, with whom I've had
<br>
other recent correspondence.  
<br>
<p>(I'm trying to figure out his references to my alleged
<br>
defense of the British Empire in India...  Not that I
<br>
haven't made such a defense on occasion, in reference
<br>
to the British manageing to finally stamp out the
<br>
Thugee Shiva Cult that practiced mass ritual murder of
<br>
innocent travelers throughout most of India,
<br>
thoroughly corrupting the local Rajah rulers by a
<br>
combination of death threats and bribes of stolen
<br>
goods, among other endearing religious rituals, as one
<br>
example, but my overall feelings are hardly
<br>
enthusiastically with colonialist powers, altho
<br>
sometimes they represent a major improvement.  
<br>
<p>I don't recall any conversations or exchanges with
<br>
David re any of this, however, so I'm assuming that
<br>
he's confusing me with someone else on that particular
<br>
issue.)  Still, a viewpoint worth throwing into the
<br>
fray...
<br>
<p>Hi Phil.
<br>
<p>I cannot see how to reply to the articles at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0304/7321.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0304/7321.html</a>
<br>
so I'll 
<br>
just answer you .  Post if you want.
<br>
<p><p>1.  Burden of proof is on those who would police the
<br>
contents of 
<br>
other peoples' minds, or who contend that it is even
<br>
remotely 
<br>
possible to base a society's freedoms on blinding the
<br>
mighty, 
<br>
something that the mighty will simply never allow.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Defense through obscurity is the weirdest delusion
<br>
I've ever seen. 
<br>
For ten years I've asked adherents to point to one
<br>
society, ever, 
<br>
that tried that approach and achieved anywhere near
<br>
what we've 
<br>
achieved through general openness and general
<br>
accountability.
<br>
<p>The whole point of The Transparent Society was not to
<br>
predict or 
<br>
prescribe an end to privacy, but to ensure that a free
<br>
people have 
<br>
enough sovereign power - based on general openness and
<br>
knowledge - to 
<br>
vote themselves and enforce a bit of privacy and make
<br>
it stick.
<br>
<p>2. THE SHORT VERSION ABOUT 'WORLD GOV&quot;
<br>
<p>Last year I gave a dinner speech for the World
<br>
Federalist Society 
<br>
(led by former independent Presidential candidate John
<br>
Anderson) at 
<br>
which I pointed out a few relevant factors. (A couple
<br>
of months later 
<br>
I also did a keynote for the Libertarian convention!)
<br>
<p>1. Antipathy toward increasing world structure or
<br>
'government' has 
<br>
different sources, depending on where you look.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dictators and oligarchs see it as a threat to their
<br>
local power.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small nations see it as a vehicle for hegemony by
<br>
the US et. al.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major corporations see it as likely to become a
<br>
taxing authority.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western political classes see it as arising out of
<br>
the UN, and thus 
<br>
becoming an impotent talking society in which action
<br>
becomes 
<br>
impossible and 3rd world perceptions dominate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Western citizenries perceive it as a potentially
<br>
dangerous 
<br>
accumulation of centralized power.
<br>
<p>The thing I focus on is the last of these.  (Citizen
<br>
empowerment is 
<br>
my fetish.  See:
<br>
<a href="http://www.futurist.com/portal/future_trends/david_brin_empowerment.htm">http://www.futurist.com/portal/future_trends/david_brin_empowerment.htm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own son, at age six, expressed a deep worry
<br>
about even the 
<br>
notion of a World Government, since &quot;There wouldn't be
<br>
anywhere else 
<br>
to run away to, if it turned bad.&quot;  (Clever boy!)
<br>
<p>I think it's very important to peer closely at the
<br>
average voters and 
<br>
citizens in the West, since they will ultimately
<br>
decide whether this 
<br>
issue becomes a front burner item.  They are the
<br>
people your book 
<br>
might persuade.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dozens of talks and speeches, I have found
<br>
that nearly all of 
<br>
the people I meet express a set of shared values --
<br>
whether 
<br>
republican or democrat etc -- a vast majority of them
<br>
declaring (a) 
<br>
suspicion of authority, (b) individualism, (c)
<br>
accountability and (d) 
<br>
tolerance as high values.
<br>
<p>Their principal difference is nearly always WHICH real
<br>
or potential 
<br>
center of authority they worry about.  But nearly all
<br>
deeply worry 
<br>
about internationalization of authority.
<br>
<p><p>2.  The 'anti-globalization movement' is currently a
<br>
transfixing 
<br>
focus for what used to be called the Activist Left. 
<br>
Young people 
<br>
follow world leaders around, creating urban theater
<br>
neat World Bank &amp; 
<br>
other meetings, decrying abuse of the environment, of
<br>
labor, of 
<br>
children, etc.  The irony is that each of these
<br>
problems was 
<br>
addressed in their home (western) countries by the
<br>
very last method 
<br>
they think of using  -- politics and law.
<br>
<p>In other words, their reflex revulsion toward
<br>
'globalization' is 
<br>
ill-considered.  Labor, children, and the environment
<br>
all benefited 
<br>
in their homelands from INCREASES in political and
<br>
legal structure. 
<br>
The decreases in structure that they demand can only
<br>
succor local 
<br>
oligarchies that currently are the main enemies of the
<br>
environment, 
<br>
labor and children.
<br>
<p><p><p>3.  THE LONG VERSION ABOUT WORLD GOV:
<br>
<p><p>Dear Phil
<br>
<p>While I agree with much of your criticism toward the
<br>
British Raj, and 
<br>
especially the way it favored the rapaciousness of the
<br>
rich, there 
<br>
were aspects to the story of Pax Brittanica that
<br>
illustrate a glacial 
<br>
movement of imperial power toward the era of
<br>
transition that we live 
<br>
in today.
<br>
<p>For example, the notion, publicly trumpeted, that at
<br>
least there was 
<br>
a GOAL of education and social mobility under a civil
<br>
service 
<br>
meritocracy. True, this was largely lip-service but
<br>
lip-service can 
<br>
be under-rated since it represents a core value that
<br>
the idealistic 
<br>
can always appeal to.*  It was always assumed that
<br>
India would 
<br>
eventually achieve some sort of autonomous home rule,
<br>
for example... 
<br>
though the Brits figured it would take till 2300 AD
<br>
and that the 
<br>
elevated wogs would then be forever grateful. True,
<br>
this was racist 
<br>
and patronizing. It was nevertheless relatively new in
<br>
the way 
<br>
empires approached their satrapies and Ghandi was able
<br>
to exploit the 
<br>
core assumption -- that the ultimate purpose of the
<br>
Raj was to serve 
<br>
Indians.
<br>
<p>My point remains that through most of recorded
<br>
history, there were 
<br>
three main conditions --
<br>
1) chaos,
<br>
2) conflict between kingdoms, and
<br>
3) peace&amp;order under an imperium.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all three circumstances all had their bad
<br>
aspects - we are 
<br>
now able to imagine something better (e.g. the
<br>
politically correct 
<br>
goody 'federation' of Star Trek) - it is important to
<br>
remember what 
<br>
enabled and freed up our imaginations.  It has been a
<br>
new kind of 
<br>
peace and order.
<br>
<p>Focus on the imperium:  even in early times, a &quot;pax'
<br>
generally 
<br>
operated under some kind of law and a notion of limits
<br>
to individual 
<br>
power.  If a local kingdom was ruled by a genocidal
<br>
madman, there was 
<br>
always the possibility that the Imperium might
<br>
intervene.  It was a 
<br>
recourse. Inefficient, often cruelly callous or
<br>
indifferent, but 
<br>
always there as a possibility. To intervene if things
<br>
got really 
<br>
grotesque.
<br>
<p>By the standard of all past imperiums, Pax Americana
<br>
(PA) is an 
<br>
improvement.  Take for example the mercantilist
<br>
trading patterns you 
<br>
referred-to, in which local Indian mills were crushed
<br>
by preferences 
<br>
favoring textiles made in Manchester. This was
<br>
Ghandi's biggest 
<br>
economic complaint. All imperiums did this...  except
<br>
ours.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Under George Marshall (See my essay calling him the
<br>
&quot;person of the 
<br>
20th Century at <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/">http://www.davidbrin.com/</a>) PA
<br>
established 
<br>
COUNTER-mercantalist policies, allowing former enemies
<br>
and allies to 
<br>
keep out American manufactures while sending their
<br>
output to us.
<br>
<p>Why did Marshall and Truman do this?  Perhaps it was
<br>
the low 
<br>
unemployment and sense of superabundance that America
<br>
felt after 
<br>
WWII.  Or the fact that these two men were
<br>
exceptionally disconnected 
<br>
from traditional ruling classes.  Or something else.
<br>
<p>The result was the greatest transfer of wealth in
<br>
human history. 
<br>
Several TRILLION $ poured from America to other
<br>
countries, far 
<br>
outweighing all over forms of aid combined!  Only we
<br>
get no credit 
<br>
for this 'aid', since it consisted of Americans buying
<br>
mountains of 
<br>
crap they never really needed,  thus creating
<br>
investment and jobs and 
<br>
infrastructure etc in foreign lands that exploited
<br>
their local cheap 
<br>
labor... but not without benefits across the entire
<br>
spectrum of 
<br>
society.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children of the exploited in these countries
<br>
went to college.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make no mistake, this is the exact phenomenon
<br>
that lifted first 
<br>
Western Europe, then Japan, Taiwan, Korea etc.   It
<br>
was the 
<br>
transforming tool of the 2nd half of the 20th Century.
<br>
<p>Today, it is China's turn to by raised up by this
<br>
beneficence - if 
<br>
you can call it that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironies abound. One can argue that we've benefited
<br>
with cheap 
<br>
goods (duh!) and therefore deserve no credit for
<br>
kindness.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, it matters.  It was wiser by far than the
<br>
trade systems set 
<br>
up by any other empire.  If China joins the middle
<br>
class, it will be 
<br>
80% because we bought enough cheap crapola to sink the
<br>
state of 
<br>
Florida.
<br>
<p>Likewise, toppling Saddam has to be seen in context of
<br>
history.  The 
<br>
imperium is the court of last resort in a world
<br>
without true law.  I 
<br>
am quite pleased that we stepped in and, at small
<br>
human cost, exerted 
<br>
our imperial whim to finally topple a vicious
<br>
psychopath that we 
<br>
created in the first place and cynically left in power
<br>
in 91.  I 
<br>
don't think it was necessary to ruin the Western
<br>
Alliance in order to 
<br>
do it, or to pee in everybody else's lunch, or to save
<br>
the Oil 
<br>
Ministry while ignoring human or historical needs. 
<br>
But maybe that's 
<br>
just me.
<br>
<p>Whether we've behaved better that other empires is
<br>
nice, but 
<br>
insufficient. We seem to be falling prey to the mental
<br>
and emotional 
<br>
sicknesses of imperial ego - much like the &quot;Hail
<br>
Brittania&quot; frenzy 
<br>
that surges in the Late Victorian era  ... frantic
<br>
flag-waving while 
<br>
nursing an illusion of omniscience, omnipotence and
<br>
infallibility.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we often ARE right.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn't make those illusions any less stupid
<br>
or dangerous.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that counts is that we, as Pax Americana,
<br>
MUST behave as 
<br>
if we are to be the LAST empire.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must set an example and use our narrowing
<br>
window of influence 
<br>
to help design Whatever Comes Next (WCN) -- or what
<br>
George Bush Sr. 
<br>
called a new world order.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What nobody talks about is that WCN must be
<br>
something that offers 
<br>
RECOURSE against abuse by capricious power.  That is
<br>
the basic 
<br>
measure of law.  And recourse must be offered not only
<br>
to nations and 
<br>
corporations, but to individuals who suffer abuse at
<br>
the hands of 
<br>
nations and corporations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That kind of recourse to law implies citizenship in
<br>
something 
<br>
larger and more universal than the old model of
<br>
national sovereignty.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, WCN will follow American-led values of
<br>
individualism, 
<br>
dispersed authority, multiply-redundant accountability
<br>
and safety 
<br>
from oppression by all kinds of tyranny -- including
<br>
tyranny by any 
<br>
voting majority.  Any other kind of World Governance,
<br>
we know, will 
<br>
collapse into Big Brother.  I share this conviction
<br>
with my fellow 
<br>
countrymen.  Most notions of &quot;world Government&quot; send
<br>
chills up my 
<br>
spine.
<br>
<p>So?  We are the experts on checks and balances. On
<br>
distributed 
<br>
authority, accountability and protection of
<br>
individualism from mass 
<br>
homogeneity.  We can influence - and even take the
<br>
lead - in 
<br>
designing WCN. But only if we participate -- and
<br>
that's the problem.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What empire will willingly contemplate helping to
<br>
shape its own 
<br>
replacement?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last thing you will ever hear a politician
<br>
speak, lest he/she 
<br>
face public suicide, is the phrase &quot;World Government.&quot;
<br>
<p>So instead, by default, we are allowing WCN to take
<br>
shape in the 
<br>
weirdest and most ugly way -- through the creeping
<br>
creation of 
<br>
international bureaucracies and civil service cabinet
<br>
departments 
<br>
like the World Trade Agency.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These major agencies are in effect pieces of
<br>
World Government, 
<br>
taking shape in the European manner, following
<br>
European models and 
<br>
European bureaucratic sensibilities.... all without
<br>
the moderating 
<br>
influence of a genuine executive or legislature who
<br>
are answerable to 
<br>
voters, or a court system answerable to lawsuit.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The multinationals and the rich like this system,
<br>
because such 
<br>
bureaucracies innately serve their interests.  But
<br>
meanwhile, 
<br>
individual citizens have no standing in such bodies. 
<br>
They cannot 
<br>
step up to seek particular recourse, not in any way or
<br>
at any level.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, corporations can be citizens of
<br>
Earth and speak to 
<br>
its governing bodies, but you and I cannot.
<br>
<p>Why are we allowing this to happen?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because these portions of World Government can
<br>
take shape in 
<br>
gradual stages, never uttering the dreaded &quot;WG&quot;
<br>
phrase, while 
<br>
maintaining an illusion that nation states still reign
<br>
with complete 
<br>
sovereignty.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of course they don't.  America proved that by
<br>
proclaiming we 
<br>
can and will go wherever we feel threatened, with the
<br>
power and full 
<br>
rights of a police force, though without the systems
<br>
of oversight. We 
<br>
claim this, justifying it in the manner of all past
<br>
imperial 
<br>
states... because we can.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response the world can only sigh and be grateful
<br>
that the big 
<br>
cowboy is, after all, America -- and therefore a wee
<br>
bit more 
<br>
well-meaning than not.  A bit more likely to be right,
<br>
than not. This 
<br>
could be much worse.
<br>
<p>That the imperial model must fade away is obvious to
<br>
anyone who reads 
<br>
science fiction, or looks ahead more than a decade
<br>
into a future of 
<br>
change.  The present situation will not last, any more
<br>
than other 
<br>
empires lasted.  Today we are arrogantly driving the
<br>
mighty in places 
<br>
like Paris, Beijing and Moscow into each others arms,
<br>
to mull over 
<br>
ways of 'restoring balance' from a unipolar to a
<br>
multipolar world. 
<br>
Allowing this to happen is highly unpragmatic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we avoid taking our proper leadership role in
<br>
designing WCN, 
<br>
because the task frankly frightens the hell out of us!
<br>
&nbsp;Creating a 
<br>
lawful and just and wise world commonwealth of 6
<br>
billion autonomous 
<br>
and independent citizens is the mightiest task ever to
<br>
face a 
<br>
generation.  We show no sign yet of any willingness to
<br>
confront it 
<br>
head on.
<br>
<p>Far better to nurse an illusion that America will
<br>
always be supreme 
<br>
-- and decent and good -- and that proliferating
<br>
technologies - soon 
<br>
delivering weapons of mass destruction into the hands
<br>
of blithe 
<br>
hobbyists (!) - won't make it absolutely essential
<br>
that we finally 
<br>
enter a new era of human history, the era of genuine
<br>
law.
<br>
