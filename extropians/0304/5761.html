</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Start with generally spreading transhumanist memes.
<br>
Not forcibly, *definitely* not where they wouldn't be
<br>
welcomed.  Just spreading them, like Johnny Appleseed
<br>
spreading apple seeds.
<br>
<p>Continue with analyzing said ideals to see which could
<br>
be brought to reality in the next decade or so, and by
<br>
what means.  Link people to resources - usually
<br>
intellectual, rarely (but not never) material - where
<br>
the result will be (usually slightly) further
<br>
realization of said ideals.
<br>
<p>But the core is trying to find ways to make a living
<br>
at
<br>
it.  Some have said the time is not ripe for
<br>
Transhumanist, Inc. type companies.  I strongly
<br>
disagree.  Indeed, those seem to be one of the most
<br>
likely paths to making the dreams real, at least for
<br>
certain fields.  I recall discussing on this list, in
<br>
the not too recent past, a potential business to
<br>
develop and market all manner of implanted devices to
<br>
augment human functionality above the norm.  My
<br>
present
<br>
efforts also include trying to make a profitable
<br>
business, or at least allow others to do so, of
<br>
private
<br>
rocket transport, with the ultimate aim of affordable
<br>
lunar travel (or beyond, but I'd probably shift to
<br>
lunar development, for instance extraction of helium-3
<br>
and the development of fusion reactors to consume
<br>
same,
<br>
if this does pan out very successfully).  There may be
<br>
other such technologies ready for immediate
<br>
development
<br>
into consumer availability, but if so, I am not
<br>
presently aware of how one would make the pieces fit
<br>
in
<br>
a realistic (which, for businesses, includes
<br>
profitable) manner.
<br>
<p>Note that this is *effort*, as measured solely by
<br>
myself.  Although my present day job consumes a good
<br>
amount of my time, for example, it requires little
<br>
actual effort - and affords opportunities for slack,
<br>
during which I can contemplate and research the above.
<br>
In any case, it is one I presently plan to abandon for
<br>
one of the above mentioned transhumanist ventures
<br>
within two years, once I finish securing the funding.
