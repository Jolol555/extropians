<p>
There is a new book that I hope some people on this list
<br>
read, or are reading, that sheds a tremendous amount of 
<br>
light on the paradoxes of the current world political
<br>
situation.  The book is &quot;World on Fire&quot;, by Amy Chua.
<br>
The author, if anything, appears slightly more liberal
<br>
than conservative, but certainly is not following any
<br>
ideology.  Probably not coincidentally, if I'm right
<br>
about this book:  because new paradigms of course don't
<br>
fit prior preconceptions.
<br>
<p>The book's subtitle is &quot;How Exporting Free Market
<br>
Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability&quot;.
<br>
The author is a professor at Yale Law School, has
<br>
traveled extensively, and &quot;lectures frequently on the
<br>
effects of globalization to government, business, and 
<br>
academic groups around the world&quot;.  She's also a native
<br>
(of Chinese descent) of the Philippines, and in my opinion
<br>
speaks much more freely about many topics than most of
<br>
us in the West permit ourselves to.  From her accounts,
<br>
it's obvious that she's held innumerable discussions with
<br>
people living in all these different developing nations.
<br>
<p>The first four chapters are fascinating alone for their
<br>
descriptions of the conditions and politics in many
<br>
countries around the world, from Southeast Asia to
<br>
Latin America and Africa.  She definitely has the
<br>
touch of an anthropologist!   I think that she does
<br>
an outstanding job getting inside both the undeveloped
<br>
countries, and the minds of their peoples around
<br>
the world.
<br>
<p>The second four chapters concern &quot;The Political
<br>
Consequences of Globalization&quot;, and include the
<br>
backlash and the counter-backlash to globalization's
<br>
effects; together the first eight chapters lay the
<br>
groundwork for the following introduction to the
<br>
last four chapters of the book:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global spread of free market democracy has thus
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been a principal, aggravating cause of ethnic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instability and violence throughout the non-Western
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.  In country after country outside the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West---from Mandalay to Moscow, from Jakarta to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nairobi---laissez-fair markets have magnified the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often astounding wealth and economic prominence of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an &quot;outsider&quot; minority, generating great reservoirs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ethnic envy and resentment among the impoverished
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;indigenous&quot; majority.  In absolute terms the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majority may actually be marginally better off as a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of markets---this was true, for example, of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia and most of the Sounteast Asian countries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the 1980s and 1990s---but these small
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improvements are overwhelmed by the majority's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuing poverty and the hated minority's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extraordinary economic success, invariably including
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their control of the &quot;crown jewels&quot; of the economy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy, sadly, does not quell this resentment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, democratization, by increasing the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political voice and power of the &quot;indigenous&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majority, has fostered the emergence of demagogues
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---like Zimbabwe's Mugabe, Serbia's Milosevic,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia's Zyuganov, Bolivia's Great Condor, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rwanda's Hutu Power leaders---who opportunistically
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whip up mass hatred against the resented minority,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demanding that the country's wealth be returned to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the &quot;true owners of the nation.&quot;  As a result, in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its raw, for-export form, the pursuit of free market
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;democracy outside the West has repeatedly led not to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;widespread peace and prosperity, but to ethnic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confiscation, authoritarian backlash, and mass killing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does al this have to do with the West?  Is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-Western world perhaps just hopeless---too
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divided, backward, and violent to sustain free
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market democracy?  Perhaps the United States and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other Western nations should simply wash their hands
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of underdeveloped societies and their intractable,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horrendous problems.  In the end, what do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;market-dominant minorities and ethnonationalism have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do with us?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, they have everything to do with us.  Or so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this final part of the book will argue.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next four chapters will show that the explosive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confrontation between a market-dominant minority and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an aroused ethno-nationalist majority is by no means
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limited to the non-Western world.  On the contrary,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this confrontation lurks beneath some of the most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violent, abominable episodes of Western history.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, even today this explosive dynamic is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confined to individual developing countries.  It is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being played out at regional and global levels in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways that directly affect the Western nations,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particularly the United States.
<br>
<p>I very much want to see this viewpoint criticized; also,
<br>
even if she's exactly right, it's hardly clear what
<br>
consequently the best course of action would be.  (I've
<br>
not gotten to what, if any recommendations she has yet.)
<br>
