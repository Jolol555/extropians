<p><p><em>&gt; My opinion exactly.  How long will broadcast TV remain???  With things like

<p>I have thought some more on this and it ties in with several other threads 
<br>
that have been discussed I the past.
<br>
<p>I have long wondered about the natural progression of technology such as the 
<br>
jump from a basic wheel to a cart. In our argument, we have agreed that point 
<br>
to point is the most efficient method for long distance comms and that even 
<br>
everyday local comms are becoming more and more PTP. Cable and satellite TV 
<br>
have greatly reduced the TV broadcast emissions from the planet. 
<br>
With lasers now being used for a very large number of comms, replacing 
<br>
microwave links, etc. One question in my mind is 'how would the world be 
<br>
different if lasers had been used when they were discovered back in the early 
<br>
sixties?' 
<br>
If the potential for laser comms had been realised way back then, would the 
<br>
earths RF emissions into space only have been on a time scale of a few 
<br>
decades, rather than the ~100 years as we see it now? 
<br>
It has also made me think about IP/Copyright and patent of new tech. If we 
<br>
had no such protections on innovation, surely a free economy would force much 
<br>
faster evolution of technology, thus reducing the delectability of a 
<br>
civilisation.
<br>
<p><p>The long and convoluted thought process that I have gone though wondering 
<br>
just how short a time, a civilisation could be detected. It has made we 
<br>
wonder if the natural progression of tech and other factors, could actually 
<br>
lead to civilisations that have either virtually no emissions or only emit 
<br>
for an immeasurably small time frame on the scale of the universe. 
<br>
<p>I see this as a real possibility and if true, it would mean our chances of 
<br>
discovering ET's conversations would be very slim indeed. 
<br>
