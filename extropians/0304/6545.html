<p><em>&gt; contemporary humans were selected. Our genome can have changed little since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beginnings of agriculture, so, genetically, humans remain Stone
</em><br>
<p>Damien Sullivan writes:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; See, it's that &quot;can have changed little&quot; which I frankly question.  It's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 500 generations.  The Grants in the Galapagos have seen genetic shifts in 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generations.  If a diet of grains had been that bad for us, I think that'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a corresponding strong selection pressure to get better at eating grains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lactose tolerance among Caucasians is one minor example of adapting to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local diet.  And is it speculated that American Indians and aborigines have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less tolerance for alcohol since they're new to it.  (They have a weakness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, but whether that's cultural or metabolic I don't know.)
</em><br>
<p>I have to agree with Damien.  Even though the genome changes slowly in
<br>
terms of new mutations and new genes, what we need to look at is the
<br>
gene pool.  What is the distribution of the various genes, which ones
<br>
are prevalant and which ones are rare.  The gene pool in a population
<br>
subjected to new selective pressures can change very quickly; as Damien
<br>
says, in just a few dozen generations.
<br>
<p>Especially given that a prehistoric diet was highly variable and
<br>
uncertain, individuals within a group would probably have evolved a
<br>
variety of digestive and dietary genetic strategies which would have
<br>
coexisted in equilibrium.  One person would do better in times of famine,
<br>
another would be better suited to exploit times of plenty.  Some could
<br>
digest grains better, others meat.
<br>
<p>Then once you throw in 5000 years of agriculture, the gene pool is going
<br>
to change enormously, as the selection pressures for eating and digestion
<br>
are so different.  It's pretty certain that the gene pool for us today is
<br>
very different from the one that existed in prehistoric times.  The set
<br>
of genes that exists today may not be different, but the proportions and
<br>
distribution are going to be totally changed.  It's highly unlikely that
<br>
a random person today would have very similar digestive capabilities to
<br>
those of a cave man.
