Interesting thoughts, Greg. I do absolutely agree with the notion, that the 
<br>
primary element that caused the Apollo project to be cut short, was the 
<br>
withdrawal of the Soviets from the Lunar landing race. Had they continued, 
<br>
had they persevered, I guess that having a small, and temporary lunar 
<br>
research cabin, starting in the late 1970s, would have been a sure thing. 
<br>
Affording to build a large lunar research or military base would have been a 
<br>
different story. Could the technology of the time have accomplished this, 
<br>
driven by advances in computer technology, that was driven by the space race? 
<br>
It makes a person wonder, given the advances in metallurgy, atomic weapons, 
<br>
jets, radar, antibiotics, rocketry, telemetry, that the Second World War 
<br>
produced.
<br>
<p>As far as the intentions and behavior of the PRC, I would ask the question 
<br>
Dorothy asked upon meeting Glenda in OZ: &quot;Are you a good witch or a bad 
<br>
witch?&quot;  The PRC is a prickly, nationalistic, jingoistic, nation-state; not 
<br>
unlike the attitude of the post 1866 Prussian ruled Reich. So much for 4000 
<br>
years of Confucian and Laotzuist tradition and philosophy. We are dealing 
<br>
with a different breed of cat. I am not sure that the Chinese, will be 
<br>
capable, anytime soon, of being interested in a group project; which in 
<br>
itself, would undercut the sought-after prestige they seem to crave. If they 
<br>
land on the moon and begin dancing on the old aluminum US Flag, that may 
<br>
indeed ignited a new space race.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;No, the real target for a &quot;Chinese space race&quot; is the U.S.  And I think
<br>
this is a GREAT thing, since it could provide the same kind of spur to
<br>
both sides that the Cold War rivalry did in the 1950s-1970s.  The hunger
<br>
for a globally-visible affirmation that China has &quot;arrived&quot; on the world
<br>
stage is nearly universal in that country, and this impetus provides a
<br>
deep reservoir of support to achieve the Chinese space program's stated
<br>
goal, which is the establishment of a permanently manned base on the
<br>
moon within the next twenty years.
<br>
<p>Beyond (or beside) this, I see a potentially very favorable development
<br>
in the possibility of inviting the Chinese to participate in the ISS
<br>
program.  Since the Shenzhou spacecraft is just an updated Soyuz, it
<br>
ought to be maximally compatible with the Russian elements of the
<br>
station.  Here's my dream: The Russians carry through with their deal to
<br>
begin launching from the ESA equatorial launch facility in South
<br>
America, so the station can be slowly moved to a more reasonably aligned
<br>
orbit.  Meanwhile, the Chinese begin to provide ferry and lifeboat
<br>
service with Shenzhou flights, while at the same time working on a
<br>
unilateral lunar program.  Wouldn't that be great?!?!
