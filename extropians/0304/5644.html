Oh goody an interesting discussion for a change...
<br>
(paint me tainted...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg [mailto:<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=RE:%20Opposite%20of%20antagonistic%20pleiotropy">asa@nada.kth.se</a>]
</em><br>
(is this not from Anders but a quote from someone else??)
<br>
<p>At any rate:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But what do you call a gene that does the same thing all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the time, but this function is good in youth and bad in old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; age? Is it also called AP?
</em><br>
<p>I'll go you one better (I believe in poker this is called
<br>
raising the stakes) and cite a concrete example --  the regulation
<br>
of iron storage in the human body.  Iron is essential -- you
<br>
have to have it to transport oxygen.  Men do not lose iron
<br>
every month, women do -- so there are sex specific regulatory
<br>
issues (that do not currently, at least to my knowledge, seem
<br>
to be incorporated into the genome).  Reserves of iron are
<br>
essential -- to recover from accidental losses.  But iron
<br>
is an essential nutrient for bacteria -- one doesn't want it
<br>
floating around where they can get their hands on it.
<br>
<p>So one has a whole set of genes to absorb iron from the
<br>
environment (transport it under controlled circumstances --
<br>
the transferrin molecule), store it in a protected environment
<br>
(the ferritin molecules) and then probably a collection of
<br>
molecules to store/unstore it in a controlled fashion.
<br>
<p>*But* iron is a pro-oxidant -- the more of it you have
<br>
&quot;available&quot; the more likely it is to produce free radical
<br>
damage that damages your DNA and corrupts your genetic program.
<br>
<p>So you have to *hope* that the genetic program that evolved
<br>
to manage iron transport and storage is doing its job effectively.
<br>
<p>AP? You *need* the iron.  You cannot live without it.
<br>
But if the bacteria get their hands on it you are lunch
<br>
for them.  If it just gradually accumulates and isn't managed
<br>
*very* well it slowly destroys the genetic program you
<br>
require to survive.  Isn't this a Catch-22 situation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is the pleiotropy part that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am worried about, since the gene does not change behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in any way.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This would be true for the entire iron collection and regulatory
<br>
system in the human body.  I.e. it is always doing what it does
<br>
because that is necessary for short-term survival.  It (probably)
<br>
does not change its &quot;behavior&quot; over the lifetime of the organism.
<br>
The net result -- it may help the organism survive and reproduce
<br>
(the selfish gene concept) but may be ultimately detrimental.
<br>
<p>It isn't that the &quot;impact&quot; on the organism is changing.  The
<br>
&quot;impact&quot; may be continual over time -- and it may cause
<br>
detrimental effects due to the accumulation of very small
<br>
side effects over a very long period of time.
<br>
<p>The typical concept of &quot;antagonistic plieotropy&quot; is that something
<br>
is designed to help out early on but ultimately ends up being harmful.
<br>
<p>One needs to take a step back to see that the system is misdesigned
<br>
from the get-go.  Either we should not be using iron as an oxygen
<br>
transporter (eliminating the free radical damage it might produce
<br>
if improperly managed) or we should not have a genetic information
<br>
carrier (such as DNA) that can be damaged by free radicals.  (Now of course
<br>
if one eliminated the mutation of the genetic information carrier
<br>
one probably puts a significant handicap on evolution so we might not
<br>
even be here to discuss this but these are mere details.)
