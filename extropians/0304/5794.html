Subject: Help with a Minimum Wage Model
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I would like some help with a model in which minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws would have a positive effect on the wealth of, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, then the lowest wage earners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I posit N entrepreneurs in country X where there exist M &gt;&gt; N
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (that is, M much greater than N) low-level workers.  In order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to become wealthy, an entrepreneur must enlist the aid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers in his enterprise.  Only entrepreneurs and workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now it seems to me that if the numbers N and M are fixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e., no worker may become an entrepreneur) and M is larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the number of workers H that the entrepreneurs can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly use, then a minimum wage causes H people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receive more money than the H workers would receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise, supposing also that at least M-H workers receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing in every case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's only with these assumptions that I can see how minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wage laws help the poor.
</em><br>
<p>### A minimal wage law is an attempt to do good with other people's money -
<br>
the legislator (and the voter who elected him on the basis of a promise to
<br>
enact the law) are attempting to effect a transfer of funds to poor people,
<br>
without directly giving up a part of their own income, merely by restricting
<br>
the ability of others to enter into contracts. The employer, and,
<br>
indirectly, his customers are asked to defray the cost out of the funds
<br>
available to them. As usual with such schemes, those who are burdened so,
<br>
will attempt to reduce the payout, e.g. by substituting mechanized labor,
<br>
stopping to patronize businesses which have to increase prices to comply
<br>
with the transfer demands, and the total amount redistributed to the poor
<br>
will be greatly reduced. Demand for services will be reduced, meaning that
<br>
the persons who give up the use of services, like dog grooming, maid
<br>
service, due to increased prices, will experience diminished utility. The
<br>
diminished demand for services will reduce the number of employed,
<br>
increasing either crime or taxes needed to support them (usually both). An
<br>
increase in crime and taxes will further diminish the efficiency of the
<br>
system, meaning lower wages, and more workers falling beneath the minimum
<br>
wage, closing the vicious circle. This should be the case even in the
<br>
artificial situation of fixed N and M.
<br>
<p>Generally, trying to do good with other people's money is a bad idea.
<br>
Helping the poor can be achieved by less dishonest means, such as offering
<br>
employers subsidies to hire workers, e.g., by matching every 1$/hour in
<br>
wages
<br>
paid with 1$ in subsidy, up to a stated minimum. This will not induce a
<br>
shift to
<br>
mechanized labor (which otherwise would occur specifically in the industries
<br>
&nbsp;most likely to employ the poor) keeping the pool of available workplaces
<br>
almost intact. Users of services provided by the poor would no longer be
<br>
specifically targeted to support the poor, meaning that they would be more
<br>
likely
<br>
&nbsp;to be able to afford such services, and experience the utility derived from
<br>
using them.
<br>
If financed by a flat tax, this would mean that all citizens (=all voters +
<br>
all politicians
<br>
+ all employers + all higher-income workers) would contribute to the
<br>
survival of
<br>
the poor, in accordance with the duty of basic solidarity, which most of us
<br>
recognize as having, but many of us try to avoid paying for by demanding
<br>
minimal wage laws.
