<p>Of course, most western people (including the opponents of the war) 
<br>
wished a quick and painless victory of the coalition, after the war
<br>
begun. It is a common misunderstanding that the opponents of the war
<br>
liked Saddam Husseins regime. It is just that they were afraid about 
<br>
the loss of human lives. 
<br>
<p>OTOH, dancing people in the media does not mean too much. It means
<br>
about as much as the pictures of children that have loosed their arms
<br>
and legs and mothers wining over their dead children. These are
<br>
some real (or faked) singular happenings do not say too much about
<br>
the overall picture. In fact, there were a lot of people who have
<br>
welcomed Hitlers army as it occupied Paris. 
<br>
You can always find the correct pictures to justify whatever you want.
<br>
<p>We have to wait and look whether this is really the begin of
<br>
a free and democratic system, or just the change from an anti-American
<br>
regime to a pro-American one. Of course, the chances are very good that
<br>
it gets better. The question is: how much better does it gets?
