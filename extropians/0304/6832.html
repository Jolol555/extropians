<p>Nope, not to my knowledge.  These may help in digestion but that
<br>
is about it.  In fact because they may provide a greater availability
<br>
of amino acids, particularly the essential ones, they might even have
<br>
an effect opposite of that you were seeking.
<br>
<p>You have to up regulate the activity of the two primary
<br>
protein recycling pathways in individual cells.  Those
<br>
are the &quot;26S proteasome&quot; and the &quot;lysosome&quot; (Google for more).
<br>
There may be some minor protein recycling that takes place
<br>
via specific proteases but I'm unsure about this.
<br>
<p>I strongly suspect that there are sensors that detect
<br>
shortages of the essential amino acids [see 1].  Under
<br>
those situations I expect that protein recycling via
<br>
one or both of the above cited pathways gets its activity
<br>
increased to provide more of these amino acids within
<br>
the cell.  A lack of the essential amino acids is a
<br>
critical condition as it would bring most protein
<br>
synthesis to a rapid halt.  In the case of the non-essential
<br>
amino acids the cell can compensate by shifting resources
<br>
to the synthesis of those amino acids.
<br>
<p>The only way I know of currently to activate these pathways
<br>
is to remove some of the essential amino acids from the diet.
<br>
Eventually we may understand the activation pathways in more
<br>
detail and be able to develop drugs but that is at least a
<br>
few years from now.  The only way I know of currently would
<br>
be to live on a diet biased towards beans or corn.  I believe
<br>
both of these may be deficient in one or more of the essential
<br>
amino acids (Harvey or gts or someone may want to confirm this).
<br>
Obviously there is a possible market out there for a &quot;protein
<br>
shake&quot; which leaves out specific amino acids if it can be
<br>
determined that low consumption of specific amino acids
<br>
activates the protein recycling pathways in synergistic ways.
