Charles asked
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is patriotism love of one's country, or love of one's country's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government?  It makes a big difference.  Then there's the distinction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the ideal image of one's country's government, and any current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What your patriotism identifies as one's focus of love makes a large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it does.  In an analogy between persons, do you love
<br>
your son, or do you love the ideal image of your son?
<br>
<p>Samantha writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I deeply love the principles this country was founded on.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply abhor the cancerous growth that dares to posture as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate government of a [once] free people.  I have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loyalty to that which is set to the destruction of what I love.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, but it's not the same thing to &quot;love&quot; the various
<br>
high-minded principles that have been enunciated from time to
<br>
time in history.  I presume that you love the Declaration
<br>
of the Rights of Man, or even, if you were to objectively read
<br>
it, the Soviet Constitution of the former U.S.S.R.  Like the
<br>
founding documents of the United States, all these put forth
<br>
great principles I'm sure you would love.
<br>
<p>Patriotism, or love of country, is not the same thing at all.
<br>
Either you have a deep emotional bond to an actual nation and
<br>
its people, or you do not.  Perhaps only a small majority of
<br>
the members of most Western nations today have such a loyalty.
<br>
<p>Here, to further remind you of what patriotism consists, is
<br>
the Pledge of Allegiance, exactly as I had to recite it on my
<br>
first day of school in September 1953:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;States of America, and to the republic for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which it stands, one nation indivisible with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liberty and justice for all.
<br>
<p>American patriots are those individuals who can read these
<br>
words, and agree with every nuance of sentiment they contain,
<br>
and who indeed are themselves allied with that republic.
<br>
<p>Lee
