</em><br>
<p>I think the question is not whether grains are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in any
<br>
absolute sense. It is rather &quot;What are the best sources of calories?&quot; 
<br>
<p>Agricultural products, including whole grains, are very low on the list when
<br>
ranked according to a nutrients/calorie ratio. The same is true for dairy
<br>
products. It's better to lose these foods from the diet and replace the lost
<br>
calories with those from nutrient-dense foods. 
<br>
<p>It is no coincidence that doing so also forces one to abide by a nearly
<br>
perfect paleolithic diet. We became genetically adapted to this diet over a
<br>
period of about 2 to 4 million years. 
<br>
<p>(To be perfectly paleo one must also eliminate legumes and a few other items
<br>
like tomatoes.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Baby mammals multiply their weight a few times on milk.  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can you say it has little value? 
</em><br>
<p>Milk has value to mammal babies because mother's milk (including human
<br>
mother's milk) is rich in colostrum and other valuable nutrients important
<br>
to *newborns*. 
<br>
<p>But no mammal other than homo sapiens consumes milk in adulthood. In fact
<br>
the human body downregulates the production of lactase (the enzyme that
<br>
metabolizes lactose, aka milk sugar) in the first couple of years of life.
<br>
Many humans (and the majority of them outside of Europe and America)
<br>
downregulate the production of this enzyme so much that they become lactose
<br>
intolerant in adulthood. Obviously the human genome does not expect milk in
<br>
adulthood. 
<br>
<p>Moreover homo sapiens is the only species on earth that steals and drinks
<br>
the milk of other species. From a naturalist's perspective, adult human
<br>
consumption of cow's milk is downright bizarre. It's almost vampire-like.
<br>
Unfortunately 10,000 years of dairy farming and billions of dollars of
<br>
advertising by the dairy industry have convinced many of us that it's
<br>
perfectly natural.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Grape juice or whole wheat bread: which would you rather live on?
</em><br>
<p>One cannot live on either of these foods alone.
