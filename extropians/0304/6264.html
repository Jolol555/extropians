GEORGE W. BUSH
<br>
<p>&nbsp;We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We
<br>
&nbsp;just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road
<br>
&nbsp;or not. The chicken is either with us or it is against us.  There is no
<br>
middle ground here.
<br>
<p><p>COLIN POWELL
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Now at the left of the screen, you clearly see the
<br>
&nbsp;satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.
<br>
<p><p>HANS BLIX
<br>
<p>&nbsp;We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have
<br>
&nbsp;not yet been allowed access to the other side of the road.
<br>
<p><p>MOHAMMED ALDOURI (Iraq ambassador)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The chicken did not cross the road. This is a complete  fabrication. We
<br>
don't even have a chicken.
<br>
<p><p>SADDAM HUSSEIN
<br>
<p>&nbsp;This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite  justified in
<br>
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it
<br>
<p><p>CBS NEWS
<br>
&nbsp;According to the latest Gallup poll, 87% of the American people said  that
<br>
they believed the chicken crossed the road to get to the other side,  but
<br>
this is because the chicken was only a paycheck away from being  homeless,
<br>
and because after he lost his job because of Reagan, Bush, and Bush,  he
<br>
needed to cross the road for prescription drugs
<br>
<p><p>CNN
<br>
&nbsp;To escape from the US troops occupying its country
<br>
<p><p>FOX NEWS
<br>
&nbsp;To sit on the golden chairs inside the Presidential palace in Baghdad
<br>
<p><p>NANCY PELOSI
<br>
&nbsp;We all knew that the chicken would be able to cross the road  We all need
<br>
to question why we gave up on the inspections
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and why so many chickens have died
<br>
<p><p>AL SHARPTON
<br>
&nbsp;Why did the &quot;chicken&quot; cross the road?
<br>
&nbsp;Why didn't the &quot;cat&quot; or the &quot;dog&quot; cross the road?
<br>
&nbsp;You white racist!
<br>
<p><p>AL GORE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I invented the chicken. I invented the road. Therefore, the  chicken
<br>
crossing the road represented the application of  these two different
<br>
functions of government in a new,  reinvented way designed to bring greater
<br>
services to the  American people.
<br>
<p><p>BILL CLINTON
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  And when you say chicken,  it
<br>
all depends on your definition of chicken is.  I feel her pain.
<br>
<p><p>RALPH NADER
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The chicken's habitat on the original side of the road had  been polluted
<br>
by unchecked industrialist greed. The chicken  did not reach the unspoiled
<br>
habitat on the other side of  the road because it was crushed by the wheels
<br>
of a  gas-guzzling SUV.
<br>
<p><p>PAT BUCHANAN
<br>
<p>&nbsp;To steal a job from a decent, hard-working American.
<br>
<p><p>RUSH LIMBAUGH
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but I'll bet
<br>
&nbsp;it was getting a government grant to cross the road, and
<br>
&nbsp;I'll bet someone out there is already forming a support
<br>
&nbsp;group to help chickens with crossing-the-road syndrome. Can  you believe
<br>
this? How much more of this can real Americans  take? Chickens crossing the
<br>
road paid for by their tax  dollars, and when I say tax dollars, I'm talking
<br>
about your  money, money the government took from you to build roads  for
<br>
chickens to cross.
<br>
<p><p>MARTHA STEWART
<br>
<p>&nbsp;No one called to warn me which way that chicken was going.
<br>
&nbsp;I had a standing order at the farmer's market to sell my
<br>
&nbsp;eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little
<br>
&nbsp;bird gave me any insider information.
<br>
<p><p>JERRY FALWELL
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't you  people see the
<br>
plain truth in front of your face? The  chicken was going to the &quot;other
<br>
side.&quot; That's what they  call it -- the other side. Yes, my friends, that
<br>
chicken is  gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too.  I
<br>
say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this  abomination that the
<br>
liberal media whitewashes with  seemingly harmless phrases like &quot;the other
<br>
side.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>DR. SEUSS
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Did the chicken cross the road?
<br>
&nbsp;Did he cross it with a toad?
<br>
&nbsp;Yes, The chicken crossed the road,
<br>
&nbsp;But why it crossed, I've not been told!
<br>
<p><p>ERNEST HEMINGWAY
<br>
<p>&nbsp;To die. In the rain. Alone.
<br>
<p><p>MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross  roads without
<br>
having their motives called into question.
<br>
<p><p>GRANDPA
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
<br>
that the chicken crossed the road, and that  was good enough for us.
<br>
<p><p>BARBARA WALTERS
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Isn't that interesting? In a few moments we will be
<br>
&nbsp;listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the  heart-warming story
<br>
of how it experienced a serious case of  molting and went on to accomplish
<br>
its life-long dream of  crossing the road.
<br>
<p><p>JOHN LENNON
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Imagine all the chickens crossing roads in peace.
<br>
<p><p>ARISTOTLE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.
<br>
<p><p>KARL MARX
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It was an historical inevitability.
<br>
<p><p>VOLTAIRE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I may not agree with what the chicken did, but I will
<br>
&nbsp;defend to the death its right to do it.
<br>
<p><p>RONALD REAGAN
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What chicken?
<br>
<p><p>CAPTAIN KIRK
<br>
<p>&nbsp;To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.
<br>
<p><p>FOX MULDER
<br>
<p>&nbsp;You saw it cross the road with your own eyes! How many more  chickens have
<br>
to cross before you believe it?
<br>
<p><p>SIGMUND FREUD
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken  crossed the road
<br>
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.
<br>
<p><p>BILL GATES
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I have just released eChicken 2003, which will not only
<br>
&nbsp;cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important
<br>
&nbsp;documents, and balance your checkbook - and Internet
<br>
&nbsp;Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.
<br>
<p><p>ALBERT EINSTEIN
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move  beneath the
<br>
chicken?
<br>
<p><p>THE BIBLE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the  chicken, &quot;Thou
<br>
shalt cross the road.&quot; And the chicken  crossed the road, and there was much
<br>
rejoicing.
<br>
<p><p>COLONEL SANDERS
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I missed one?
