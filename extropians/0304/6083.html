<p>
I am in absolute shock and awe that no one felt the events of yesterday were
<br>
worthy of mention.  Here the symbolic downfall of one of the worst murderous
<br>
dictators in the world took place, and people held under his oppresion
<br>
rejoiced and desicrated the stalinistic reminders of his murderous rule.
<br>
<p>The events witnessed today were similiar in context to the destruction of
<br>
the Nazi headquarters in Berlin in WWII, and the fall of the Berlin Wall in
<br>
89.  People viewint those events witnessed the downfall of facism, and
<br>
totalitarian communism, respectively.  Yesterday we may have witnessed the
<br>
tipping point to the downfall of non-democratic oppression, the downfall of
<br>
the horrific statist imposed stagnation that has befallen the people of the
<br>
middle east for so many years.  Today we saw liberation of some of the 20
<br>
million people, and the final steps are being taken to free the rest.
<br>
People who now have peaceful progressive futures open to them, people who
<br>
may be future Pastuers, Einstiens, Feynman's, Goddards, Sadats or Drexlers.
<br>
All free now.
<br>
<p>The people were exhibiting pure joy, why no recognition of this salient
<br>
event in the history of the spreading of democracy and freedom throughout
<br>
the world?
<br>
<p>Where is the joy at the spreading of freedom and democracy on this list, is
<br>
freedom and democracy not extropian, or are members of this list not
<br>
extropians?
<br>
<p>What happened to the hundreds of thousands of civilian causalties, the
<br>
angered and embittered Iraqi people, who instead were joyous and
<br>
celibratory.  How are those who opposed to this reconciling these images
<br>
with their opposition?
<br>
<p>Are these events not extropic, or are members of this list not in favor of
<br>
celebrating extropic events?
