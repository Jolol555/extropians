<em>&gt; So what are the results?  Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news is that I've lost a lot of weight.  Today I was 187, down about 8
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pounds in 12 days.  I think much of that is water weight; the diet acts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a diuretic and I'm going through a lot of water.  I lost half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight in the first three days!
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the Atkins diet is very dehydrating.  A lot of water weight is lost
<br>
immediately.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also want to get my cholesterol tested in a few weeks.  You're supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get it done before beginning the diet, but I was too impatient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did have it tested a couple of years ago so that would be my basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison.  Eating two or three eggs a day plus a lot of fatty foods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm worried about what is happening to my blood.  However Atkins claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the diet won't hurt, or at least that it will raise the &quot;good&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol enough to compensate for any rise in the &quot;bad&quot;.  We'll see.
</em><br>
<p>This is my problem with the Atkins diet.  I agree with the fact that
<br>
low-carbs will cause more fats to burn.  But I think it is wishful thinking
<br>
to assume that eating all the bad fats and then burning them off will avoid
<br>
their bad side-effects.  However, I fear that merely having the fats pass
<br>
through the bloodstream can contribute to cholesterol build-up.
<br>
<p>Atkins doesn't /require/ high fat for any purpose.  I think people can get
<br>
the benefit of Atkins by avoiding carbs, but not increasing fats.  That is,
<br>
a high protein, moderate fat (or good oils), low carb diet.
