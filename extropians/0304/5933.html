<em>&gt; Spud this is something that has puzzled me.  Why is there
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Okay, thanks for the soft toss:  here it goes.  The whole point
<br>
was never any particular harm that would come from global
<br>
warming, or nuclear energy, or oil seepage, etc., but rather
<br>
from the need for CRISIS, any crisis.  The existence of perceived
<br>
crisis is the fastest way to revolutionarily insist that power be
<br>
concentrated at the highest levels (namely authoritarian govern-
<br>
ment's), so that radical action could be undertaken by government
<br>
in the name of the people against all the perceived threats (big 
<br>
corporations, traditional values, capitalism, etc.)
<br>
<p>That's all it is.  As global warming is perceived to be a boon
<br>
rather than catastrophe, the squawking and crisis-mongering
<br>
will merely turn to something else.  (Following the collapse
<br>
of the Soviet Union, one heard very little about American
<br>
Imperialism, but with the post 9-11 determination to forestall
<br>
further attack, it's easy to see that the shrill voices will
<br>
revert to that old theme.)
<br>
<p>Remember: *every* perceived crisis can be used as a tool against
<br>
capitalism, the free market, and the hegemony of the West by its
<br>
enemies.
