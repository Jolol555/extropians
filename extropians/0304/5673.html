</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But you experience them every day.  That was part of the point of the 
<br>
psychology class demonstration.  They aren't considered &quot;visions from 
<br>
God&quot; unless they have a strong emotional content, and a claim to 
<br>
infallibility, but lesser manifestations occur to all of us every day.  
<br>
Zazen is an attempt to break out of these hallucinations.  My 
<br>
experiments indicate that it can be partially successful, but cause be 
<br>
to be dubious that the success can be permanent (&quot;then the mountains are 
<br>
mountains again&quot;, so perhaps the Zen masters agree with me).
<br>
<p>If you mean that you want the fill to have more emotional content, watch 
<br>
someone else accepting or denouncing the current war.  Lots of emotional 
<br>
fill going on there, and it's much easier to see in someone who 
<br>
disagrees with you (whatever your viewpoint, you can find emotionally 
<br>
driven disagreement).
<br>
<p>These &quot;hallucinations&quot; are the underpinnings of consciousness.  Read 
<br>
Dennetts &quot;Darwins Dangerous Invention&quot; or ... I don't remember it this 
<br>
instant, the book where he is talking about the structure of mind, and 
<br>
the problem of trying to find a decent meaning for &quot;I&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A loose paraphase of an Arthur C. Clarke comment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says that any contact between two civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of vastly different technological ability is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive to the less advanced.  Perhaps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aliens (gods) are not talking on purpose.  spike 
</em><br>
<p>Aliens are (if genuine) external.  The gods are archetypal.  They sit at 
<br>
the interface between mind and body.  They are mental constructs that 
<br>
appear to be external.  Their usual mode of operation is not independant 
<br>
external existence, but rather someone, or something, who is a good 
<br>
projection screen being projected upon.  Occasionally they are so 
<br>
strongly activated that someone will experience them as external 
<br>
entities independant of other external entities.  This is usually a 
<br>
symptom of something catastrophic having happened to the person.   Mind 
<br>
you, this is not the same as &quot;visions&quot;, which are known as such.  Those 
<br>
are not necessarily symptoms of catastrophism, but are still quite 
<br>
dangerous to one's sense of reality.  Joan of Arc comes to mind as an 
<br>
example.   (She was a quite fortunate case, who was able to adapt well 
<br>
to her new reality, even if it did eventually lead to her death.  With 
<br>
foreign troops running all over the country that might have happened 
<br>
anyway.)
<br>
<p>Freud called the activations of gods &quot;projections&quot;, a term and concept 
<br>
that is useful to an external observer, but not very useful to one who 
<br>
is experiencing them.  Archetypes emphasises that they are the basic 
<br>
elements of though, and that they are structures of thought that are 
<br>
shared by all people.  God emphasis that they appear to be independant, 
<br>
external, and potent (or sometimes subtle).   All of these terms are 
<br>
pointing at the same thing.  They are all, within limits, accurate.  And 
<br>
they all tend to ignore that most activations are quite low-key, and 
<br>
missed by both experiencerers and observers.  (It may be some power law, 
<br>
like the one that governs the frequency vs. size of celestial bodies.)
<br>
<p>But I can guarantee that you experience these events every day.
