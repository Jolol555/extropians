</em><br>
<p>Agreed!  We fortify dairy with vitamin D3, butter with vitamin A1, bread
<br>
with vitamin B3a, kids drinks with vitamin C1, salt with iodine, water with
<br>
fluoride, other things with calcium....

<em>&gt; Practically any vegetable is more nutrient-dense than any agricultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product. As for getting all your calories from vegetables, I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting a vegetarian diet! On the contrary I consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian diets to be unhealthy (though still more healthy than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typical American diet).
</em><br>
<p>I think most vegetarians are ignorant of nutrition and therefore eat a very
<br>
poor diet.  They assume that it is more &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;healthy&quot; and they
<br>
don't bother to make sure they eat enough protein and vitamin B12.  Thus,
<br>
most vegetarians have these two critical deficiencies.
<br>
<p>However, I see vegetarianism as a perfect Extropian diet.  (Hmmmm....  a new
<br>
best seller:  &quot;The Extropian Diet&quot; )
<br>
<p>It is an easy form of slight calorie restriction, which is very good.  It
<br>
avoids most of the problems with modern diets, being high-fiber, low-cal,
<br>
low-fat, low-salt, high-antioxidants.  etc. The top killers today seem to be
<br>
diet related in ways that the vegetarian diet solves.  Plus, it is easy to
<br>
find high protein processed veggie foods today.  They are modified into fake
<br>
meats, burgers, hot-dogs, slabs of veggie protein steak, etc.  It is
<br>
relatively easy to eat a good vegetarian diet.  It is much easier than being
<br>
on a weight-loss diet where you have to be hungry all the time.  A typical
<br>
complaint from new vegetarians is that they have to eat more.  Vegetarians
<br>
also tend to have slightly lower body temperatures (possibly due to being
<br>
thinner or having less fat insulation), but which might also be good for
<br>
longevity.

<em>&gt; One more point about the diets of hunter-gatherers: most wild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game is far leaner than domestically raised meat. The Texas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historian J. Frank Dobie, writes of an ailment known as &quot;rabbit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fever&quot; (not to be confused with tularemia, which goes by the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colloquial name), which frontier people got when they were away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from civilization, living mostly off wild game. It was a wasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ailment, indicative of a lack of calories; symptoms also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included impaired judgment. One could avoid rabbit fever when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the trail by carrying along enough corn meal and lard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplement the wild game diet.
</em><br>
<p>I have often concluded that the problems with a modern meat-based diet is
<br>
more due to the horrible composition of meat which is radically different
<br>
today than in previous centuries.

<em>&gt; I have recently been seeing reports of studies saying organic

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I am not sure that pesticides cause this as much as farms being totally
<br>
devoid of nutrients in the soil due to generations of farming.  The soil is
<br>
empty of organics, and only has the minimum amount sprayed on to sustain the
<br>
crops.
