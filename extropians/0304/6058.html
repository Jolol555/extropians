<p><em>&gt; &gt; I've never seen a society getting richer that got (internally)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worse.  I'd rather a country be run by rich hoodlums that by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Define &quot;internally worse&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I meant worsened morals, more crime, less &quot;civilized&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That rapid growth of GDP seems correlated with increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inequality seems well-accepted (debate is over how much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inequality matters.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  The most that the inequality matters, IMO, is 
<br>
the degree to which people exhibit unhelpful emotions,
<br>
mainly antagonistic envy and resentment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US has kept on getting richer over the last few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades, but income in the bottom segment has fallen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in absolute terms (module [modulo] the existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff which couldn't be bought before... but food and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; housing are basics.)
</em><br>
<p>I recall that you may be right about the absolute status
<br>
of a certain segment near the bottom, but don't have any
<br>
evidence at hand.  Certainly if people are unwilling to
<br>
move, life can become more inhospitable in certain areas.
<br>
<p>Moreover, a number of bad laws have worsened the prospects
<br>
of the poor, and have increased inequality.  Zoning ordinances
<br>
are now used to prevent growth and thus to cordon off &quot;good&quot;
<br>
areas so that poorer people cannot move there.  Thus over time
<br>
cities become less homogeneous compared to, say, 1900.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Britain got richer in the enclosure movement, with tenants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being kicked off the land for sheep farming; the tenants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would probably have words about it not getting internally worse.
</em><br>
<p>The land was communally owned, not privately, and it was becoming
<br>
a worse disaster each year for the people living there (they were
<br>
not tenants as such, yet).  This, of course, is what is referred
<br>
to as &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot;.  When the land became privately
<br>
owned, it turned out not to be theirs.  (Surprise, surprise---
<br>
zoning in the 18th century---the rich get to exclude the poor.)
<br>
In any case, the conditions in the cities to which they moved,
<br>
as atrocious as they are to us, were probably better than the
<br>
horrific conditions from which they came.
<br>
