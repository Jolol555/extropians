<em>&gt;From: Greg Burch &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20FITNESS:%20Diet%20and%20Exercise">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;inspirational and informative details snipped for brevity&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The combination of all these factors having dramatic results in a short
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time is nothing short of astonishing to me: Being twice as strong, being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pain-free and carrying 10% less weight has made me feel like I've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transformed into some kind of superman: I walk lighter and feel much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better. Even without the sugar and carbohydrates in my diet, I have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy as a result.  Given that many in our group have sedentary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;brain-worker&quot; lifestyles and a survey of any EXTRO meeting reveals a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good deal of extra poundage and not enough lean muscle, I thought I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;share this story.  If I can do it, anyone can.
</em><br>
<p>Greg, first off let me say I've always had a sense of admiration for you 
<br>
based on your obvious intelligence and your oft-needed objective, clear 
<br>
thinking &quot;voice of reason&quot; (not to mention your impressive reading list -- 
<br>
which I sometimes refer to when wondering what to read next).  That 
<br>
admiration is only increased by your candor and willingness to inform and 
<br>
inspire your fellow out-of-shapers.  It takes a big man to admit to his own 
<br>
foibles.  It takes a giant to do so publicly.
<br>
<p>I found your story very inspirational.  I was actually leaning toward 
<br>
skipping today's trip to the gym.  But now, ... no way!  Thanks for the 
<br>
inspiration.  Congratulations on your success.  May it serve you well in the 
<br>
millennia to come!
<br>
<p>-Zero
