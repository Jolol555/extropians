<em>&gt; My girlfriend just last night finished the fiction book _Prey_ by Michael

<p>We have had some discussion about this book, for example at
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=61;action=display;threadid=53836;start=0">http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=61;action=display;threadid=53836;start=0</a>.
<br>
It is, as you say, about a nanotech experiment gone wrong.  I thought
<br>
it was pretty bad, not at all a realistic depiction of what might go
<br>
wrong with nanotech.
<br>
<p>Lately, Crichton's books are merely preliminaries to screenplays.
<br>
I thought his previous book, Timeline, was terrible, but it's being
<br>
made into a big budget time travel movie.  Hopefully it will flop (no
<br>
dinosaurs, just medieval knights), and then Prey will have one more hurdle
<br>
to leap on its well-paved path to the movie screens.  It would be a shame
<br>
if millions of movie-goers have this be their first exposure to nanotech.
