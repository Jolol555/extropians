</em><br>
<p>Yeah, no one disagrees that the Iraqi regime is very very bad. That's not
<br>
really the issue. There are a lot of bad leaders in the world who would
<br>
treat their people and their POW's badly, but we don't normally sacrifice
<br>
the lives of Americans for that reason alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Any footage that may emerge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the deaths of innocent Iraqi citizens will be equally as sobering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The deaths caused by the Iraqi government?  Directly (shot),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly (forced human shield)?... 
</em><br>
<p>It makes no difference how they die. The murder of innocent people is never
<br>
a good thing, no matter what the reason or the method. As invaders of Iraq
<br>
with full knowledge of Saddam's wicked personality, we are indirectly
<br>
responsible even for the atrocities that Saddam commits against his own
<br>
people in his own defense. The real question is whether it's worth it or
<br>
not. How many innocent Iraqis should die now as a consequence of the war
<br>
effort to save how many innocent Iraqis who could theoretically die later by
<br>
Saddam's hand? How can anyone figure the math? 
<br>
<p>I say no one can figure the math. The best we can do is think, as I do, &quot;God
<br>
bless America if she's in the right, and forgive her if she's not.&quot;
