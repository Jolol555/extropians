</em><br>

But evolution is a process, not a snap-shot.  At any particular 
<br>
time-place-(species&amp;individual) there will be certain ways in which it
<br>
is adapted, and others in which it isn't.  These will summate to a 
<br>
probability for success (i.e., successful creation of 
<br>
great-grandchildren).  But this success it a human perspective.  The 
<br>
individual perspective is &quot;here I am now, it feels like X, so I'm going 
<br>
to do Y.&quot;  This is summated over a population.  If Y is generally a 
<br>
&quot;good enough&quot; answer, the species persists.  Since the individuals are 
<br>
different, those less adapted to the environment will be more likely to 
<br>
make a poor choice of Y (for themselves).  But if someone lacks the 
<br>
ability to synthesize vitamin C, and  their mate likes the taste of 
<br>
citrus, then grandchildren are more likely to result, with a combined 
<br>
lack of ability to synthesize vitamin C and preference for citrus.  Not 
<br>
a huge change, but an adaptive one.  (Adapting to synthesize vitamin C 
<br>
again is more difficult.)
<br>
<p>So, for example, if a population begins herding cattle, drinking milk 
<br>
will become an option.  But it is only useful if you can digest it.  So 
<br>
children whose ability to digest milk persists will have an advantage 
<br>
when food is scarse.  This will cause a shift in the genes.  But there 
<br>
is more than one factor involved, and they adjust on a &quot;as it happens&quot; 
<br>
basis.  So the ability to digest lactose and the ability to tolerate 
<br>
high cholesterol diets are decoupled, and each adapts to the 
<br>
circumstances separately.  But each adapts to the circumstances.  After 
<br>
a few centuries, the population is mixed.  And the values of each 
<br>
adaptation vary with the seasons (how much food of what kind is available).
<br>
<p>Note that circumstances never hold still.  Adaptation is always to the 
<br>
current environment, and is never perfect.  Adaptations to the old 
<br>
environment may easily get lost if they are no longer relevant.  OTOH, 
<br>
if they aren't expensive, they may persist unaltered for a long time.  
<br>
Or they could persist in an altered form (since they aren't being used, 
<br>
changes wouldn't necessarily be maladaptive).
<br>
<p>In short, the only model in which the paleolithic diet is presumed to be 
<br>
optimal is one that assumes:
<br>
1) the paleolithic diet was optimal for the people then living, and
<br>
2) evolutionary change is quite slow
<br>
Condition one is made more likely because normally the environment 
<br>
changes quite slowly, and evolution has time to keep up.  But this 
<br>
presumes the entire ensemble of paleolithic conditions.  Air pollution 
<br>
may well increase our need for vitamin C or E, to take one minor example 
<br>
of why it might not be optimal now.  Condition two is much less 
<br>
probable.  Demonstrating that we aren't optimally adapted to the current 
<br>
diet is easy, but that's not proof that we are adapted to any particular 
<br>
time in the past.  Since the changes are largely decoupled, the way to 
<br>
bet would be that we aren't.
<br>
<p>Still, a better question might be, are we more nearly adapted to the 
<br>
paleolithic diet than to the modern diet.  But do remember to adjust for 
<br>
body sizes, activity levels, chemical stresses, etc.  So even that's not 
<br>
a simple question, though the probable answer begins to appear to be yes.
