<p>
Extending the &quot;basic self-improvements&quot; thread, I figured I cast around for a
<br>
bit of financial advice.  This is something I've read a lot about before, so I
<br>
don't need stuff about the basics.  But all my money is in savings accounts,
<br>
and I thought I should think about more.
<br>
<p>Item 1: I only have a few grand, and suspect whatever I could safely do with
<br>
it in the next few years would be dwarfed by one year of real income.
<br>
Item 1a: &quot;real income&quot; as in computer jobs like the one I used to have.  Now
<br>
I'm a grad student.  One next stage in my lifestyle is postdoc... don't know
<br>
how much they actually make.
<br>
Item 2: I've got a credit union with 2.15% savings.  They're usually good, so
<br>
this shocked me, until I checked what current CD rates were at normal banks
<br>
and unions.  About the same.  Go my union!
<br>
Item 3: Another union had 60-month IRA certificates at 3.66%.  That looks
<br>
decent for the times.  And if I could open an IRA Monday I could maybe save a
<br>
hundred bucks in taxes.
<br>
Item 4: But US I savings bonds (inflation adjusted bonds) are 4.08%.  Which
<br>
reminds me that the current inflation rate seems above even the good savings
<br>
rates, which kind of sucks...
<br>
<p>So, IRA, I bonds, other?  I know the Treasury also sells 'TIPS', I think
<br>
another form of inflation adjusted bonds.  I fear stocks when I have so little
<br>
wealth.
<br>
