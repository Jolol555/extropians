<p><p><em>&gt; Karen writes

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     I want also to point out that the Shiite cleric Khoei who was
</em><br>
murdered
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by Iraqi's, and whom the USA backed (according to the news), was not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; friend to the USA.  The USA has a history of supporting and empowering
</em><br>
new
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leadership (e.g. Qadhdhafi of Libya) over their predecessors and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these new leaders turn out to be very poor choices. I am afraid that the
</em><br>
USA
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is going to make such a mistake again in Iraq. The USA support of Khoei
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fueling my fears.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would be the attributes of a &quot;good&quot; choice, and why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you think that it's possible for any choice to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a situation in Iraq that would meet with our hopes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>^^^^Attributes of a &quot;good&quot; choice. Hm. Very hard question. Very hard. It is
<br>
hard for me to imagine. Let me ask first what you mean by a good choice. For
<br>
example, what I would consider a good choice for Iraq would most definitely
<br>
not be what most Iraqi's would consider a good choice for Iraq.  So I am not
<br>
sure if you were asking me what I thought was a good choice from an Iraqi
<br>
standpoint or from my standpoint. Since I believe my standpoint to be
<br>
irrelevant to the Iraqi people, I will assume you find my standpoint
<br>
irrelevant too. ;)  Now to answer the question. I don't know. I can't think
<br>
of a leadership/government in Iraq which I believe could bridge all the
<br>
conflicting religious and cultural attitudes currently troubling the region.
<br>
Perhaps someone else can think of one; can you? I am not an Iraq hobby-ist,
<br>
and I am a bit of a pessimist when it comes to the middle east.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of your question implies that I implied that I think it
<br>
is possible for a choice in Iraq to meet &quot;our&quot; hopes. Sorry, I didn't mean
<br>
to imply that kind of optimism! I am a pessimist of the oldest order. I
<br>
don't think we can have an Iraq that would meet with western hopes -- not
<br>
with current western hopes.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; place of Hussein, then we would find that he was as anywhere from as
</em><br>
open
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and loving as Ayatollah Khamenei to as sweet and charitable as Bin
</em><br>
Laden.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there anyone you know of, or any group, that you hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gains power there?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^I wish there were. Again, I am not a student especially of Iraq. My
<br>
area of special interest (in my earlier life) was mostly North Africa,
<br>
specifically Libya. All I can really say is who I hope does not gain power
<br>
there (as they surface). Sorry to be so uninformative. What about you? Do
<br>
you favor any groups there?
