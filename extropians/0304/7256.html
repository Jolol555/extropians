<p>
I thought I'd write about my own experiences with the Atkins diet.
<br>
I've been on it almost two weeks.  Coincidentally I began just a few
<br>
days after Greg Burch's post about it, although I had decided to try it
<br>
a few days earlier after a friend told me about his success with the diet.
<br>
<p>I've been trying to lose weight for almost a year now.  Despite being
<br>
quite active - I did a triathlon last year, and plan to do two this year,
<br>
and I exercise every day for about an hour, a mix of walking, running,
<br>
biking, swimming and working out at the gym - my weight had crept up to
<br>
the mid 220's.  I'm 5'9&quot; and that puts my BMI way into the obese range.
<br>
I don't necessarily agree with BMI, I don't think it works well for
<br>
someone who is relatively muscular, but my waistline was big, my pants
<br>
were tight and I knew I needed to come down.
<br>
<p>I've been on a diet since about last June, just cutting down on snacks,
<br>
not stuffing myself at meals, and it's been quite successful.  I got
<br>
down to about 195.  But then I seemed to hit a wall and for a couple of
<br>
months I couldn't get any lower.  I was feeling hungry and frustrated;
<br>
even though it felt like I was depriving myself, and I had increased
<br>
my exercise, I still wasn't losing weight.  That's why I decided to
<br>
try Atkins.
<br>
<p>The diet has been easy to follow, although it is a huge change from how
<br>
I normally eat.  I have been eating low fat for years - lots of carbs,
<br>
bread, cereal, pasta, big servings of vegetables with dinner, modest
<br>
amounts of meat.  Several years ago I was eating vegetarian for about
<br>
three years, but I put on quite a bit of weight on that diet.
<br>
<p>With Atkins, I'm eating almost the opposite of what I used to, but it
<br>
has been surprisingly easy to change.  Partially it is because I am now
<br>
eating as I did when I was a kid, growing up in the 1960s.  Eggs and
<br>
bacon or ham for breakfast, tuna or chicken salad for lunch, meat with
<br>
some veggies and salad for dinner.  These are familiar foods for me, and
<br>
they have a nostalgic quality as I haven't indulged in them for decades.
<br>
<p>I also bought some special products, low carb versions of foods I couldn't
<br>
have otherwise, like ketchup and barbecue sauce and salad dressing.
<br>
I've been eating Atkins snack bars and the pre-made shakes as well, which
<br>
taste great and satisfy my sweet tooth (however they are quite expensive).
<br>
<p>So what are the results?  Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good
<br>
news is that I've lost a lot of weight.  Today I was 187, down about 8
<br>
pounds in 12 days.  I think much of that is water weight; the diet acts
<br>
as a diuretic and I'm going through a lot of water.  I lost half the
<br>
weight in the first three days!  But it still gives you a psychological
<br>
lift to see initial results.  And breaking through the 195 pound barrier
<br>
I'd been fighting with for so long was a great feeling.
<br>
<p>The bad news is that I haven't felt that good.  After about two days
<br>
I started getting headaches and feeling an upset stomach, with not
<br>
much appetite.  This is supposedly because ketosis is kicking in as
<br>
the body has used up its store of carbs and now has to digest fat.
<br>
The book said this would go away and I would feel full of energy.
<br>
Well, the headaches have gone away but I don't have that much energy.
<br>
My workouts are not quite as hard.  Generally I feel somewhat listless,
<br>
and I'm slow to warm up, although once I get going I can work at pretty
<br>
much the same level as before.  The one positive difference is that I
<br>
literally feel light on my feet.  The rapid weight loss is noticeable
<br>
in the soles of my feet as I walk, they feel the lessened pressure.
<br>
<p>It's possible that if I increase my carbs somewhat I'll start to feel
<br>
more energetic.  Atkins recommends doing a very low carb diet, less than
<br>
20 grams per day, for the first two weeks, then gradually increasing
<br>
the carbs and seeing how your weight loss goes.  My main concern is
<br>
the first triathlon, but that isn't until August.  I need to be at full
<br>
energy by then.  Hopefully I will be able to do that by increasing carbs,
<br>
without falling back into my old eating habits.
<br>
<p>I also want to get my cholesterol tested in a few weeks.  You're supposed
<br>
to get it done before beginning the diet, but I was too impatient.
<br>
I did have it tested a couple of years ago so that would be my basis for
<br>
comparison.  Eating two or three eggs a day plus a lot of fatty foods,
<br>
I'm worried about what is happening to my blood.  However Atkins claims
<br>
that the diet won't hurt, or at least that it will raise the &quot;good&quot;
<br>
cholesterol enough to compensate for any rise in the &quot;bad&quot;.  We'll see.
<br>
<p>Hopefully this will be useful to people who are considering this diet
<br>
or related low-carb diets.  I might post something again in a month or
<br>
so about how it's going.
<br>
<p>Hal
