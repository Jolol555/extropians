Extropian/Libertarian/Freemarketeer dogma holds that &quot;self-organizing&quot; social 
<br>
networks producing &quot;social capital&quot; will step in to take the place of Papa 
<br>
Federal Govt in quasi-anarchist utopias.
<br>
<p><p>At the same time that same Extropian/Libertarian/Freemarketeer dogma endears 
<br>
itself to CorpGovMedia by maintaining that increased ethnic and cultural 
<br>
diversity will increase social capital and that therefore a &quot;there shall be 
<br>
open borders&quot; philosophy is beneficial.
<br>
<p>However, here is article discussing a paper by an MIT social scientist that 
<br>
indicates that social capital is decreased by ethnic and cultural diversity:

<p><a href="http://vdare.com/letters/tl_033103.htm">http://vdare.com/letters/tl_033103.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p>I have always thought that the basic premise that diversity is inherently 
<br>
beneficial is flawed, just because of the conclusion drawn by the cited paper.
<br>
I have always thought that it was obvious, mainly because it is much easier 
<br>
for the citizenry to control the govt when the populace is homogenous. 
<br>
Witness Switzerland and Iceland, and to a (continually) lesser degree, 
<br>
Scandanavia.
