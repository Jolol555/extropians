</em><br>
<p>I can understand that if you feel that way, you would certainly oppose
<br>
trusted computing technology, or indeed any technology which might
<br>
decrease the acceptance and utility of the OS and tools you prefer to use.
<br>
People felt the same way about those damned horseless carriages driving
<br>
good old dependable horses off the road.  Many horsemen felt they were
<br>
&quot;being coerced into a scheme not of their choosing in order to line the
<br>
pockets of its perpetrators.&quot;  And, indeed, it is quite difficult to
<br>
get around cities on horses these days.
<br>
<p>I still think it's a mistake to call it coercion just because other people
<br>
don't choose to accommodate your preferred OS and tools.  But I suppose
<br>
you can use words how you desire.  By your definition, it is coercion
<br>
which has eliminated livery stables, hitching posts, watering troughs,
<br>
and the other infrastructure necessary for people to easily use their
<br>
horses for transportation.
<br>
<p>I hope that for consistency's sake you feel obligated to take whatever
<br>
measures are necessary to support someone else's preferred OS, no matter
<br>
how much you may dislike it, just as you expect other people to support
<br>
your own.  That implies that if and when trusted computing is fielded, you
<br>
will do all that you can to support interoperation with that technology.
<br>
Otherwise you're coercing them, right?  Or is it coercion only when it
<br>
is done to you?
<br>
