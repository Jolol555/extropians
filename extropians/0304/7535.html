</em><br>
<p>Actually that is exactly what I think. Archeologists mark the advent of
<br>
agricultural technology at about 10-12,000 B.C., at the beginning of the
<br>
Neolithic. Prior to that time we did not cultivate grains in any large
<br>
number. We might have smashed a few wild grains on primitive millstones in
<br>
the short period prior to the Neolithic (during the Mesolithic), but grains
<br>
did not become a significant part of the diet until the Neolithic, which is
<br>
just yesterday on the evolutionary time-scale. Approximately 99.99 percent
<br>
of the human genome was formed prior to the Neolithic.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What evidence are you looking at? I must have missed all the

</em><br>
<p>This general diet thread has wandered near and far under multiple subject
<br>
headings. Fortunately my email client allows me to search on words from the
<br>
text of sent email, so I can reproduce a previous post of mine that I sent
<br>
to a related thread just a couple of weeks ago...
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you provide a reference for prehistoric humans being taller than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20th century humans?  Everything I've read on the topic has said the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite.
</em><br>
<p>It may be true that we 20th and 21st century humans are near to the height
<br>
of our paleolithic ancestors, thanks to advances in medicine and nutrition,
<br>
but the evidence is that farmers in general were much shorter than their
<br>
prehistoric ancestors at least until very recently. I'll need to find the
<br>
proper sources in the bibliography of Dr. Cordain's on book on paleodiets to
<br>
give you an academic reference, but here is what he says on page 42:
<br>
<p>&quot;The archeological record clearly shows that whenever and wherever ancient
<br>
humans sowed seeds, (and replaced the old animal-dominated diets), part of
<br>
the harvest included health problems. One physical ramification of the new
<br>
diet was immediately obvious: Early farmers were markedly shorter than their
<br>
ancestors. In Turkey and Greece, for example, pre-agricultural men stood 5
<br>
feet 9 inches tall and women 5 feet 5 inches. By 3000 B.C., the average man
<br>
had shrunk to 5 feet 3 inches and the average woman to 5 feet. But getting
<br>
shorter -- not in itself a health problem -- was the least of the changes in
<br>
these early farmers. Studies of their bone and teeth reveal that these
<br>
people were basically a mess. They had more infectious diseases, more
<br>
childhood mortality, and shorter life-spans in general. They also had more
<br>
osteoporosis, rickets, and other bone mineral disorders thanks to their
<br>
cereal based diets... Instead of the well-formed, strong teeth their
<br>
ancestors had, there were now cavities. Their jaws, which were formerly
<br>
square and roomy, were suddenly too small for their teeth, which overlapped
<br>
each other.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I've seen reference by another academic to studies of mummies unearthed from
<br>
ancient agricultural Egypt. Ancient Egyptians were also a mess. 
<br>
<p>The point is this: if it is true that we are healthier today than we were in
<br>
pre-agricultural times, then it is true despite the modern diet -- not
<br>
because of it.
