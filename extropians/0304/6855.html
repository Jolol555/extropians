John Grigg asked.
<br>
&lt;&lt;Even with our current fairly sophisticated level of technology, could we 
<br>
defeat the Vietnamese NVA and Viet Cong if we were fighting that war today 
<br>
(and they were getting outside superpower help)?  And even if they did not 
<br>
get massive outside assistance, I still doubt we could avoid being utterly 
<br>
worn down by guerilla tactics combined with the dense jungle terrain which 
<br>
gives such great cover for them.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p><p>My answer is that the amount of technology would not have changed the 
<br>
equation in Vietnam. The reason was that there was a lack of political will 
<br>
to take the war to North Vietnam. 
<br>
<p>1. Johnson was afraid that in Vietnam, like Korea before it, would 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventually bring in Communist China.
<br>
<p>2. China has recently aquired the fission bomb in 1964, and had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developed the Hydrogen bomb in 1967 (Krushchev's placing of nuke
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missles in Cuba was only in 1962). Johnson and his advisors were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerned that a nuclear war with China might cost 20-30 million
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese lives, and result in a phyric victory for the US.
<br>
<p>3. Conversely, the Johnson administration was relecutant to declare it a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no-win situation, because of how this might appear to other states in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the region, thus, creating a domino effect. So we sunk into a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quagmire, unwilling to ruin the enemy, unwilling to withdraw.
<br>
<p>By not taking the war to the North Vietnamese (on the ground) there was no 
<br>
way of effecting their war production, supply, morale, and reaction, except 
<br>
by an air war, which was ineffectual. Todays JDAM guided weapons would have 
<br>
made things easier for the military, but would never have won the war on the 
<br>
ground. The principle of taking the ground, still holds even after 45 years 
<br>
of technical advances.
