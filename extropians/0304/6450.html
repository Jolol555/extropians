Amara Graps:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not sure that the U.S. government will be trusted, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if. It's reputation is damaged for the next many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many years (I am guessing for a generation).
</em><br>
<p>I wonder if the list would like to consider this question: Given that
<br>
the United States *has* damaged its reputation, what was its reputation
<br>
to start, and what is its reputation now? I don't think it's obvious
<br>
that the US's current reputation is any worse than the original.  
<br>
<p>In my mind, the claim that this administration has opened a frightening
<br>
new chapter in US foreign policy is a claim that may be overstated.
<br>
'Pre-emption' is nothing more than lawyer's sleight of hand. It's a
<br>
discursive trick used to justify an already agreed-upon course of action
<br>
post-hoc. It is a claim to have predicted the future with enough
<br>
certainty to justify intervention, and the prediction is not replicable
<br>
by anyone else because threat model is classified or based on classfied
<br>
intelligence. Justifying a pre-emptive strike without a smoking gun
<br>
requires your audience to believe in your voodoo. The US knows this, but
<br>
it's not the right to pre-empt threats they care about. It's the
<br>
*reputation* for pre-emptive thinking -- the serious consideration of
<br>
overwhelming responses even when the threat is inchoate -- that the US
<br>
is cultivating. In the end, the US calculates that achieving this
<br>
reputation in the eyes of the international community will have a
<br>
deterrent effect. Terrorists will lose governmental support, nations may
<br>
think twice about pursuing WMD, and so on. But in the end, it's just
<br>
deterrence, tried and true.  
<br>
