<p>I think Anders and other responses satisfy your quesinon.  I'm just going
<br>
to add a thought:
<br>
<p>Extropy is a philosophy of transhumanism.  It is preferred not to use the
<br>
word &quot;extropianism,&quot; but refer to the extropian philosophy.  Further, the
<br>
fundamental ideas of transhsumanism were brought together by the same
<br>
person who wrote the extropian philosophy, Max More.  Since transhumanist
<br>
basically want to improve the human condition in a positive way, being
<br>
careful about the use of technology and concerned about its affects on
<br>
humanity, is it plausible that extropy = transhumanism.  Herein, extropy
<br>
has specific principles which explain/provide the ideas in obtaining the
<br>
aforesaid goals. Not all futurists are rational, logical and careful. 
<br>
<p>Futurist FM-2030's philosophy of Upwingers, which was his basis for his
<br>
writings on transhumans has a different perspective on the specific values
<br>
of a transhuman.  His ideas are not equal to &quot;transhumanism&quot; in regards to
<br>
some accepted views, but are more sympathetic to a specific ideological
<br>
outlook as manifested by FM.  Herein, FM was more interseted in
<br>
&quot;transhuman&quot; as an evolution rather than a movement or philosophy.
<br>
<p>On another note, it is necessary to keep in mind that the extropian
<br>
philosophy of transhumanism is not a static concept.  Because values change
<br>
over time, we must remain open to changes in our perceptions.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Natasha
