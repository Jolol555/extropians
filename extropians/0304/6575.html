<p>
I have a question for the mathematically inclined on the list.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In my book I'm trying to present a timeline for when we'll be able to
<br>
/systematically/ discover the genes that impact various human traits.
<br>
To do this I have a basic plot of # of human genomes likely to be
<br>
sequenced by a given date, which in turn depends on the cost of
<br>
sequencing a human genome at a certain time and some made up number of
<br>
$$ spent on such a project.  That much I have no problem with (though
<br>
obviously it's just a toy system since I can't be fully confident of
<br>
any of the numbers).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The more challenging part is thinking about phenotypes for which there
<br>
are many different genes involved, and where the genes may combine in
<br>
a more-than-additive way.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
For example, consider the following entirely theoretical scenario:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
1) Humans who possess allele A1 of gene A have a normal distribution
<br>
of IQ relative to the general population.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
2) Humans who possess allele B1 of gene B have a normal distribution
<br>
of IQ relative to the general population.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
3) Humans who possess BOTH A1 and B1 have a statistically significant
<br>
increase in their average IQ relative to the general population.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So I want to be able to determine the number of humans whose genotype
<br>
and phenotype we'd have to capture in order to find this effect.  More
<br>
generally, I'd like to be able to express that necessary sample size
<br>
as a function of the size of the effect we're looking for and the
<br>
number of different genes involved.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have a few ideas of where to start but suspect someone on here will
<br>
have a better idea.  Any thoughts?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
thanks,
<br>
