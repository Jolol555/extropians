<em>&gt;  an emphasis on the health-improving aspects of the former. My job
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  requires about 180 days of travel per year, so finding a gym to use poses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  real difficulties.
</em><br>
<p>Yoga doesn't require equipment. Yes, I know that yoga is not
<br>
weight training, but it works your muscles much harder that you
<br>
might think.
<br>
<p>These might help you too- Water-filled weights: Aquabells

<br>
<p>My comments --
<br>
Positive: they work as advertised- durable and light travel weights
<br>
Other: What they don't have in weight -- they are essentially pieces
<br>
of plastic to fill with water and the bars for the  handweights are
<br>
more light pieces of plastic -- they make up in bulk, unfortunately.
<br>
I think that a little  too much room is filled with these in a
<br>
regular suitcase, but you might be willing to live with that, for
<br>
the advantage of saving on weight. Also, if you fill the ankle
<br>
weights to the advertised fullness/weight with water-  there is no
<br>
way to fit them around your ankles because the velcro strap is not
<br>
long enough, so therefore, let some of the water out.
<br>
<p>This is what I know because I have them for travel, and especially
<br>
for this time that I've been living out of my three suitcases the
<br>
last 4 months. Buy them through the mail in the U.S., if you can,
<br>
because it will be cheaper. I bought them through  the mail in
<br>
Germany, and paid once again the full price for shipping and
<br>
customs charges, so they were an expensive purchase for me.
