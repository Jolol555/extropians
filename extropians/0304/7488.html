<em>&gt; I notice that time and time again here on the extropian list that I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater appreciation for the theory of evolution than many others.
</em><br>
<p>I would say you have more than an &quot;appreciation&quot; of evolution.  You seem to
<br>
have &quot;faith&quot; in it as well.  Besides arguing scientific facts about what it
<br>
is, what it does, how it works, you also argue that it provides superior
<br>
information about nutrition than modern science.  You blast modern
<br>
nutritional scientists as useless and prefer to take your cues from
<br>
&quot;nature&quot;.
<br>
<p>Are you really a neo-Luddite in disguise?  I don't mean to be funny or
<br>
offensive here.  But you seem to say that we need to stick to &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
diets, and that modern science is not a good guide to figuring things out.
<br>
You say it is too dangerous to experiment with nutrition and ignore the
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; order already set out for us.  You allow some alterations to the
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; diet, but these are few and far between, and must be very well
<br>
tested and proven before they can weigh in against the &quot;default&quot; order of
<br>
nature.
<br>
<p>Do you realize that this is exactly the Luddite argument against everything
<br>
that science and technology produce?  I'm not talking about the extreme
<br>
Luddite who hates technology and doesn't know why.  I'm talking about the
<br>
rational Luddite who believes that science is moving too fast and doesn't
<br>
understand what it is espousing, or that its claims are dubious and often
<br>
contradictory.  You seem to be arguing for the precautionary principal in
<br>
regards to nutrition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In these threads,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, few people are willing to grant that 4,000,000 years of hominid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution has optimized the human genome for a prehistoric diet.
</em><br>
<p>Four millions years of evolution has optimized the human genome for
<br>
surviving just long enough to reproduce, and then quickly dying an early
<br>
death on the prehistoric diet.  This seems orthogonal or even diametrically
<br>
opposed to trying to re-optimize ourselves for longevity, which has never
<br>
been a goal of evolution.  If you want to grow fast, kill your enemies,
<br>
reproduce, and die young, then by all means, eat a prehistoric diet.  If you
<br>
want to be healthy, disease resistant, smarter, and live as long as
<br>
possible, I don't see that nature or a prehistoric diet have anything to
<br>
contribute in this area.  (Unless you want to study long-lived creatures and
<br>
transplant their genetics into humans.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nutritionists themselves cannot agree on proper diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They argue on television and at national health conferences.
</em><br>
<p>I always disagree with this claim.  After researching thousands of
<br>
nutritional experiments for my book, I *never* saw a serious disagreement in
<br>
the facts.  I hear this stuff all the time on TV, but these are
<br>
misinterpretations and conclusions.  Yes, scientists disagree on what we
<br>
&quot;should do&quot; in response to the known facts.  There are many competing
<br>
strategies.  However, there is little dispute over basic facts.  Some facts
<br>
are unknown, so good scientists allow multiple possibilities.
<br>
<p>However, what one hears on TV and in the news media is so far reduced and so
<br>
confused that it bears little resemblance to the actual experimental data
<br>
being reported.  For example, there are experiments that show 10 grams of
<br>
vitamin C fights cancer.  So TV will blare out that vitamin C cures cancer.
<br>
Then another study shows that the RDA of 1% isn't effective.  So TV
<br>
announces that the first study was wrong and vitamin C doesn't cure cancer.
<br>
Then someone retests and affirms that the cancer-fighting effect is
<br>
proportional to dose, so larger doses are better than smaller doses.  So TV
<br>
reverses its opinion again.  But then someone tries to establish an upper
<br>
limit for vitamin C and discovers at what point side-effect occur.  Then TV
<br>
says rather than curing cancer, vitamin C is poison.  Then someone clarifies
<br>
that rational doses are safe.  So TV is pro-C again.  Then someone tests
<br>
different cancers and clarifies which ones vitamin C is effective against
<br>
and which ones it isn't.  And TV announces that the cures weren't as
<br>
universal as we thought.  And so it goes....
<br>
<p>A scientist following the experiments sees no contradiction and sees greater
<br>
and greater understanding with each experiment.  TV, looking for sound bites
<br>
and controversy, shows reversal after reversal.  Pundits and diet-book
<br>
sellers develop flawed strategies based on poor understanding of nutrition.
<br>
I avoid fad diets and diet gurus.  Reading just experimental abstracts, I
<br>
have not change my mind back and forth as you seem to think nutritional
<br>
scientists do.  TV and diet gurus are not a good source of scientific
<br>
information.  I would agree with everything you say, if it is directed at
<br>
these people, but not at real scientists.  Real science keeps accumulating
<br>
knowledge and fine-tuning its understanding.  There are rarely giant
<br>
reversals of opinion as you seem to think.  My research into nutrition for
<br>
the past couple of decades has been pretty stable and changes slowly over
<br>
time.  I would suggest that if it appears otherwise, you need to stop
<br>
getting your scientific information from TV, websites, and current
<br>
best-sellers.
