<em>&gt; &gt; No one is forcing you to run such an app, and no one is forcing the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; part in these kinds of transactions.  There is no need for coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or a legal mandate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I cannot get the content and apps I need to do my work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without using TCPA then I am being forced to run it.  If it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroys alternatives then I am forced to run it.  It has very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong potential to do precisely that.
</em><br>
<p>We had some discussion in another thread about this kind of usage for the
<br>
word &quot;force&quot;.  You may be &quot;forced&quot; to use TCPA in order to do your work.
<br>
But that is different from when someone puts a gun to your head and
<br>
forces you to hand over your wallet.  The only reason you would be
<br>
&quot;forced&quot; to use TCPA is if other people that you wanted to communicate
<br>
with would impose that condition.
<br>
<p>But it is their free choice to limit how they communicate.  Part of
<br>
freedom requires respecting the free choices of others.  You do not
<br>
have the right to impose your tastes and require others to communicate
<br>
with you.  If they want to use communications technology that requires you
<br>
to run TCPA, you have no right to stop them.  So in this condition you
<br>
are not truly being &quot;forced&quot; to use TCPA, but rather you are respecting
<br>
the freedom of other people to decide how they want to communicate.
<br>
<p>And of course, you can always refuse to use TCPA and attempt to convince
<br>
others to communicate with you without those restrictions.  Persuasion,
<br>
not force, should govern your relations with others.  Hopefully we can
<br>
agree on that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Why would you revolt and attempt to kill this technology?  What gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you the wisdom to intervene in a free choice by another person to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decide what technology to use?  You would not object if a person tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to use cryptography to cloak his communications with someone else.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is wrong with someone using technology that lets him make a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; commitment that is not possible today?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because this technology is designed to kill choice and many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things I hold dear.  It is not simply a matter of individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice.  It is choice removed from individuals and enshrined in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental hardware empowering potentially or require 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially for far too many applications.
</em><br>
<p>So you are concerned that if individuals choose to use this technology,
<br>
the eventual result will be a reduction in individual choice and options?
<br>
The only way that would happen would be if TC became very popular so
<br>
that it was almost universally used, right?  Wouldn't that imply that
<br>
TC solved real problems for people?
