</em><br>
<p>Yes, if I'm following you, then you are imagining what your
<br>
experiences would be like under situations that you can't
<br>
imagine.  A worthy pastime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't expect to see magick in operation.  I assign it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiny prior probability; not quite the not-worth-tracking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitesimal, because specific people have made the claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I've put specific cognitive effort into evaluating an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejecting it;
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of the logic of simulations, like you, I've never
<br>
seen anything to make me suspect that I'm living in one.
<br>
Of course, I also happen to believe that the best physical
<br>
theories provide for the *possibility* I'm living in one;
<br>
but those same theories also provide alternate universes
<br>
in the MWI sense, and other Hubble volumes where what I
<br>
experience is *not* a simulation.  (Thus the tricky case
<br>
I like to talk about where the word &quot;this&quot; becomes a 
<br>
multiple-valued pointer, e.g., as when someone refers to
<br>
the possibility of &quot;*this being a simulation&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To see magick *as magick*, it would have to have a consilient explanation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that fit in with everything else, an explanation that did *not* invoke an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enclosing simulation translating a human fiction into reality.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite so!  The most familiar case (after age 7) is that
<br>
God exists.  (Before age 7 Santa Claus is the most credible
<br>
example.)  How long would it take God, playing fairly, to
<br>
actually persuade you that He exists, and that all the 
<br>
traditional stories in the Bible are true (up to consistency)?
<br>
<p>Me, about fifteen minutes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Presumably if magick did exist, as magick, then there would exist a valid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deconstruction of my information-theoretical objections to it, and after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearing the explanation I'd slap myself on the forehead and go:  &quot;Duh! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What a simple pattern!  It's clear that you can't have a universe like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this one without ritual spellcasting that uses spoken Latin phrases and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virgin's tears...
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I'm following you here.  After all, why would there
<br>
*have* to be an explanation?  In the scenario I just spoke of,
<br>
God would have a very simple retort to my ultimate question of
<br>
&quot;Why?&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;Because,&quot; He'd say, &quot;that's how it is.&quot;
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it'd be like having a periodic table that was missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the element of mercury but was otherwise exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same.  I'm especially embarrassed about mistaking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human rationalizations and distortions of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon for anthropomorphic inventions.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now *that* is hard to imagine.
