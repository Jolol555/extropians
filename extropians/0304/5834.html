PEACENIK JUSTIFIES PEACE TO WARMONGER
<br>
by Mike Lorrey
<br>
<p>WM: Why is it that you are protesting against the war?
<br>
PN: Because war is wrong.
<br>
WM: War is always wrong?
<br>
PN: Some think so, but I think there might be some wars that were and
<br>
are just.
<br>
WM: What sort of wars would you say are just?
<br>
PN: Wars to oust unelected tyrants who invade their neighbors and
<br>
commit mass murder and genocide, like Hitler.
<br>
WM: Really? What other reasons might be just?
<br>
PN: If such a leader used chemical or biological weapons on enemies or
<br>
on his own people, and tortures and murders political opponents.
<br>
WM: But isn't Saddam guilty of all of these things?
<br>
PN: Maybe, but you can't take the word of what exiles say, they are
<br>
prejudiced.
<br>
WM: Why would they be prejudiced?
<br>
PN: Because they have been tortured and had their families gassed and
<br>
murdered by Saddam, so their opinions are obviously unobjective.
<br>
WM: If War on Saddam is so wrong, why did you not protest how the
<br>
Clinton administration attacked Iraq, at the height of the Lewinski
<br>
scandal?
<br>
PN: Because Clinton feels the pain of women and minorities and fuzzy
<br>
bunnies and anti-gunners.
<br>
WM: That doesn't sound very consistent or principled.
<br>
PN: Our principle is that war is wrong unless it is condoned by the
<br>
United Nations.
<br>
WM: Wasn't WWII not condoned?
<br>
PN: The UN didn't exist then, which is why we had to have a war.
<br>
WM: But the League of Nations did exist, and specifically passed
<br>
resolutions outlawing war, and limiting the weapons nations could
<br>
build, among many other things that were not obeyed by Germany and
<br>
Japan, who acted much like France, Germany, and Russia have acted today
<br>
in preventing the UN or League of Nations from doing anything to avoid
<br>
war.
<br>
PN: But they did do something, they signed the Munich Pact.
<br>
WM: And how well did Germany abide by that?
<br>
PN: This is beside the issue. War is still wrong unless it is condoned
<br>
by the UN.
<br>
WM: So nations do not have any sovereign rights anymore?
<br>
PN: They have rights, but only to defend themselves if attacked
<br>
directly.
<br>
WM: So what is it you don't like about war?
<br>
PN: Silly, its because so many people die.
<br>
WM: But you say that in order for a nation to defend itself justly,
<br>
they must first submit to being attacked directly?
<br>
PN: That is right.
<br>
WM: So, you are saying that a lot of people, and generally people who
<br>
are innocent civilians, must die before a nation can defend itself.
<br>
PN: Correct.
<br>
WM: So if a criminal comes after you with a weapon, do you have to let
<br>
him stab you or shoot you dead before you are justified in defending
<br>
yourself?
<br>
PN: We don't believe you should defend yourself. Police are there to
<br>
protect you.
<br>
WM: But in the case of nations, where are the world's policemen, and
<br>
how do they decide when to protect someone?
<br>
PN: The UN votes, and member nations are then justified in acting.
<br>
WM: What happens when some nations with veto power have a vested
<br>
commercial interest in vetoing a resolution to do so?
<br>
PN: National governments do not act on crass commercial interests.
<br>
WM: So the 300 companies that have done business with Saddam's regime
<br>
have absolutely no influence in the governments that vetoed Bush's
<br>
second resolution?
<br>
PN: That is correct.
<br>
WM: But don't you claim that Bush is only going to war for oil
<br>
interests?
<br>
PN: Yes, the Bush administration is controlled by US oil company
<br>
interests, and is going to war only to increase their profits.
<br>
WM: But the Chirac administration is not controlled by French oil
<br>
company interests who actually have contracts in Iraq?
<br>
PN: That is correct. France is a far more civilized country.
<br>
WM: Now, please tell me how these US oil interests are going to
<br>
increase profits from the war.
<br>
PN: When the US oil industry controlls Iraq's oil, they will increase
<br>
profits.
<br>
WM: But if the sanctions against Iraq are lifted, won't they be able to
<br>
sell far more oil than they currently are?
<br>
PN: Yes, and this will increase US oil company profits.
<br>
WM: But if they sell more oil, won't world oil prices go down at a time
<br>
when the costs (repairing sabotaged facilities) are going up? Won't
<br>
this lead to decreasing profits and cheap oil?
<br>
PN: We are never surprised at how oil companies are able to fix prices
<br>
to earn more profits and hide income. Just look at Enron.
<br>
WM: Hmmm, so the French oil companies would never do such things?
<br>
PN: The French are so much more civilized, just look at how they
<br>
distain country music.
<br>
WM: So, tell me, what are Russias altruistic interests in opposing war.
<br>
Are you telling me that it isn't just to hide the fact that they've
<br>
been selling night vision technologies, GPS jamming technologies, and
<br>
new anti-tank missile technologies, all in violation of UN resolutions?
<br>
PN: We accept Russias statements that those were sold before the first
<br>
Gulf War.
<br>
WM: Despite the fact that the products in question did not even exist
<br>
then?
<br>
PN: Look, the basic fact is that the US is trying to use its position
<br>
as the dominant power in the world to establish an American empire
<br>
around the world.
<br>
WM: Really, when was the last time we added any territory to the US or
<br>
accepted a new state? 
<br>
PN: The 1940's.
<br>
WM: And when the Archbishop of Canterbury accused Colin Powell of such
<br>
things at a London news conference, didn't Sec'ty Powell respond, &quot;We
<br>
have sent many of our best young men and women around the world over
<br>
the years to fight for freedom, and the only land we have ever asked
<br>
for in return is enough to bury those that did not return.&quot;
<br>
PN: The US is the preeminent agressor in the world today, that is a
<br>
fact, and has been since the Reagan administration.
<br>
WM: Really, just what countries have we agressed against?
<br>
PN: Thats easy: Grenada...
<br>
WM: Who we freed from a communist coup and Cuban invaders.
<br>
PN: Nicaragua...
<br>
WM: Where we funded Nicaraguans to fight to demand the communist
<br>
Sandinistas honor their commitment to the OAS to establish a
<br>
constitution and a pluralistic multi-party electoral system.
<br>
PN: Afghanistan...
<br>
WM: Where we funded the native people to fight against communist Soviet
<br>
invaders.
<br>
PN: Panama....
<br>
WM: Where we arrested a drug smuggling thug who killed President
<br>
Trujillo and refused to recognise the election of his opponent.
<br>
PN: Libya...
<br>
WM: Whose government was funding and training airline hijackings and
<br>
terrorist attacks all over europe and the Mediterranean.
<br>
PN: You placed nuclear tipped Pershing II and Tomahawk missiles in
<br>
europe...
<br>
WM: Which helped win the cold war and freed eastern europe from Soviet
<br>
domination.
<br>
PN: Somalia...
<br>
WM: Under UN auspices, at the request of Somalis, and only to protect
<br>
aid workers.
<br>
PN: Bosnia...
<br>
WM: Uh, there had been a civil war going for several years before we
<br>
stepped in and ended the war.
<br>
PN: Kosovo...
<br>
WM: To end the genocide of albanian Kosovars by the Milosevic
<br>
government.
<br>
PN: This doesn't prove anything.
<br>
WM: Actually, it does prove something. Peaceniks, like yourself, never,
<br>
it seems, protest against the unjust acts of fascist tyrants. You
<br>
always protest against the just acts of free nations to spread freedom
<br>
around the world into areas that are under the iron fisted control of
<br>
fascist tyrants. You are the best friend of fascists. You might release
<br>
statements about what disagreeable individuals they might be toward
<br>
their own people (unless they are good socialist tyrants) but you
<br>
never, ever, ever do anything to change the world for the better. You
<br>
never take action to free anybody.
<br>
You condemn and act against anybody who takes a stand against tyrants.
<br>
Whether those tyrants are the tyrannies of foreign governments, or the
<br>
domestic tyrannies of paternalistic bureaucracies, excessive taxation,
<br>
gun control, luddism and restrictions on technological progress, it is
<br>
you who are the opponents of progress.
<br>
This is the true irony. Those who most widely claim the title of
<br>
&quot;Progressives&quot; act the most against real progress in the world, whether
<br>
it is making more of the worlds people free or increasing the quality
<br>
and quantity of freedom through technology that people already have.
<br>
You are not progressives, you are regressives.
