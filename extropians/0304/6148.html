<p><em>&gt; Indeed, it is better today than it has been at *any* time in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout human history.  Everyone is living longer, fuller, healthier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives with more free time today than at any point throughout human history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...I think this is a point not emphasized enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today as we are overrun by doom and gloom nay Sayers in our culture of fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take my favorite example, for instance, farming.  In 1650 some 98% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds entire population farm, making just enough food for themselves.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked long, back breaking days laboring in the fields from sunrise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sunset.  There was no free time for art, poetry, music, science, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress, let alone any effort to bring about a singularity, you spent your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire existence toiling away just to stay alive, and died around 35 - 40
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years old.
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting to note, however, and contrary to my optimism
<br>
and contrary to what I think is the very long term trend, life
<br>
appears to have gotten harder for people following the agricultural
<br>
revolution---or at least for some people.
<br>
<p>While a number of hunter/gatherer tribes, e.g., the Algonquin
<br>
Indians, led absolutely miserable lives (in terms of prosperity
<br>
and standard of living), and had an enormously hard time of it,
<br>
other hunter-gatherer groups were better off than after the
<br>
advent of agriculture.
<br>
<p>Agriculture allowed a much higher population density, often of
<br>
shorter, less healthy people, but proved decisive in dominance.
<br>
(Larger armies, more advanced tech, etc.)
<br>
<p>One is reminded of Robin Hanson's &quot;What if Uploads Come First?&quot;,
<br>
a bleak (and to me slightly unbelievable) picture of how once
<br>
again high tech might result in a *lowering* of income.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; By 1850, it was some 80% of the population farmed, by 1910, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the advent of nitrogen fertilizers and the recognition of the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanization, rapid changes took place.  In that year, probably some 70% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people farmed, but by 1950 it was more like 30%.  Today fewer than 2% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire world farms, and we produce more food at less cost than ever before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which means through technology, today your average farmer does the work of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some 100+ farmers of a century ago.  Amazing.  And now that we don't have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toil away in fields all day, we have time for hobbies, for nurturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests in things that make life better, longer, and more enjoyable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Retirement' did not even exist 60 years ago.  We now spend more time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning and in retirement than we do working, at least in the post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrialized west, and current trends show this will eventually spread to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all people.
