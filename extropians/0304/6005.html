<p><em>&gt; Such as one where one person owns all the land?  Or would

</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights of property?
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly the right question, and it was the one asked
<br>
by a number of American administrations in the 1950s - 1980s,
<br>
when they were doing whatever they could---hang preconceptions
<br>
and ideology---to keep nations in Latin America and Africa
<br>
from falling into the hands of the Russians.
<br>
<p>So they *encouraged* redistribution of land in a number of 
<br>
notable instances.  They too (like you and me, I think) 
<br>
understood that for all the land to be concentrated in the
<br>
hands of so few people was far from optimal in terms of the
<br>
incentives of the people and the economy to generate wealth.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the forceful redistribution of the property
<br>
UNDERMINED what existing respect there was for property rights,
<br>
and the new beneficiaries didn't feel that they had come by
<br>
the property legally, and neither did anyone else.
<br>
<p>Here is what Tom Bethell writes in &quot;The Noblest Triumph&quot;
<br>
in the introduction to the chapter &quot;Why Isn't The Whole World
<br>
Developed?&quot;, p. 186:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Observing the maldistribution of property and income in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third World, experts from the West could see that something
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed to be changed.  But their diagnosis was usually in error.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The underdeveloped countries were some how &quot;feudal,&quot;, it was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed.  Addressing the General Assembly of the United
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations in September 1950, Secretary of State Dean Acheson
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discussed &quot;the problems of the use oand ownership of land&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the underdeveloped world.  As he waw it, the problem was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of &quot;distribution.&quot;  Where redistribution had been carried
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, the result had been &quot;to give the individual farmer an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity to work for himself and to improve his status.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, land reform was doggedly pursued by American
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;officials for 35 years.  But it did not go to the root of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the problem.  In fact, it created new ones.  It is exceedingly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult to create property rights that are legitimate, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respected by all, by expropriating the property of some purely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the grounds that they are the wealthiest ownwers.  Frequently,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the effect was more to delegitimize property than to redistribute
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.  In a number of countries, including Chile, Vietnam, Iran,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and El Salvador, the efforts of land reformers undermined the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local economy and contributed to the political turmoil that for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a number of years made new on the front pages of our newspapers.
<br>
<p>And in the chapter he discusses what happened to property in all
<br>
those countries.  Often, he quotes De Soto.  Land reform had been
<br>
instituted by the Americans in Japan in 1945, and had been a 
<br>
great success.  Ever since then, &quot;well intentioned people felt
<br>
that they could be entrusted with Leninist means in order to
<br>
achieve Jeffersonian ends.  And to them, the distribution of
<br>
property was more important that its security&quot;  (big mistake).
<br>
<p>In a subsection entitled &quot;Things Go Wrong&quot;, he writes
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Latin American leaders saw billions of foreign aid dollars
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heading their way if they obliged Washington.  But they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not longer &quot;be bought off with trinkets,&quot; one warned.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conference wetting up the Alliance for Progress,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon said that perhaps 20
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;billion would be forthcoming by the end of the 1960's.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Che Guevera challenged Dillon to put that in writing.  The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans, led by Richard Goodwin and Arthur Schlesihger,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made sure that progressive policies---land reform, higher
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taxes on the rich---were implemented in return.
<br>
<p>Then he tells the sad story of Chile, where the new program was
<br>
to be tried out first.  In the 1964 election, the CIA spent three
<br>
million dollars to defeat the Marxist candidate Allende, and the
<br>
U.S. ambassador 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told an interviewer that the U.S. believed in land reform
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;as an act of humanity&quot;.   He caused a stir by adding that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;from a social viewpoint, private property is not an unlimited
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right.&quot;
<br>
<p>As you read the whole book, you see how fatal an attitude this is,
<br>
and how it fits in with the explanation that from 1825-present,
<br>
people in the West have forgotten the importance of private property.
<br>
(Adam Smith and quite a number of recognizable people knew quite
<br>
well and said so, but not often enough, so taken for granted it
<br>
was, before 1825 or so.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, an ally of Castro's working in Chile oversaw the redistribution,
<br>
which stripped huge amounts of the land from its owners.  But it worked
<br>
out so badly, that it actually helped Allende come to power.  Then
<br>
under Allende, the process was completed.  The author takes several
<br>
more pages to tell the whole story, and I'd like to quote it all,
<br>
but cannot.
