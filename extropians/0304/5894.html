<em>&gt; (Hal Finney &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Bad%20ideas%20from%20Microsoft%20et%20al">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as whether computers today are capable enough to run all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killer apps, that is a pretty static view of things.
</em><br>
<p>True, but the point is that there's no reason to expect the
<br>
technology of free computers and software to progress any more
<br>
slowly than mass-market &quot;trustworthy&quot; ones.  The only way the
<br>
latter will sell is if there's some &quot;killer app&quot; that absolutely
<br>
requires Palladium; I don't see such an app anytime soon, and
<br>
it's already too late.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In terms of TCPA/Palladium being crippled, the inventors of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems claim the opposite.  They argue that trusted computing adds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionality while retaining backwards compatibility.
</em><br>
<p>Well of course they do.  Their jobs might depend on it.  That's no
<br>
reason to take them seriously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a few years, it might be that content companies will sell you legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music and movies over the net, but only if you are running a trusted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing system.
</em><br>
<p>That's probably true, but you know as well as I do that it's a
<br>
physically impossibility to lock up the sound waves, and you can't
<br>
lock up ideas.  Musicians are already starting to realize that the worst
<br>
thing that can happen to a new band is to get a recording contract;
<br>
pretty soon consumers will start realizing it too, and the old business
<br>
models will fail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No one is forcing you to run such an app, and no one is forcing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content companies to download the data to you.  The trusted computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology makes possible a new kind of transaction which cannot occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.  Consumers may choose to adopt this technology in order to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part in these kinds of transactions.  There is no need for coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a legal mandate.
</em><br>
<p>That all true, I agree--but you could have said the same thing for
<br>
a dozen other copy-protection techbologies that have been tried over
<br>
the years.  And all of them failed miserably.  That's all I'm saying
<br>
here: comsumers aren't stupid, and they know what copy-protection is,
<br>
and they know not to buy into it, no matter what the sweet-sounding
<br>
words of the creators are.  All the double-speak of &quot;enabling&quot; new
<br>
kinds of restricted transactions is easy to see through.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would you revolt and attempt to kill this technology?
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;revolt&quot; I mean simply to refuse to patronize it, and to work
<br>
to create free alternatives.  And the reason is simple: restricting
<br>
the free exchange and use of information is inherently evil, no
<br>
matter how it is justified.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What gives you the wisdom to intervene in a free choice by another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person to decide what technology to use? 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not interfering with that choice at all; as I said, my &quot;revolt&quot;
<br>
is to make sure he understands that he is choosing to restrict himself,
<br>
and to make sure he has alternatives.  That's competition, not coercion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It frankly astonishes me that libertarians oppose trusted computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.  I seem to be the only one who sees things differently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe in freedom.  That means I accept that other people may make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions differently than I would.  Their decisions may even have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an indirectly negative impact on me.  But I would not say that I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified in trying to take options away from them, to prevent them from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using a technology like this.  I would really appreciate a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and freedom oriented explanation of why voluntarily-adopted trusted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing technology should be fought.
</em><br>
<p>You have to be careful what you mean by saying that they &quot;oppose&quot; the
<br>
technology.  I'm not suggesting--nor is any libertarian I know--that
<br>
we should forbid it, or that people shouldn't have the freedom to
<br>
restrict themselves.  All we're saying is that we haven't heard a good
<br>
argument yet why someone would want to do that other than &quot;we want
<br>
producers of content to have more control and consumers less&quot;.
<br>
<p>If I am to willingly sign away my rights to something, I expect
<br>
something big in return.  I might sign an NDA with an employer, for
<br>
example, trading some of my right to free speech for the compensation
<br>
of a job.  If I choose to run a &quot;trustworthy&quot; app on a Palladium-
<br>
enabled computer, what am I getting for giving away my rights?  Is
<br>
it worth the price?
<br>
