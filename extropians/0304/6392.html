<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I want also to point out that the Shiite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cleric Khoei who was murdered by Iraqi's,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and whom the USA backed (according to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; news), was not a friend to the USA.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; USA has a history of supporting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; empowering new leadership (e.g. Qadhdhafi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of Libya) over their predecessors and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; these new leaders turn out to be very poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; choices.
</em><br>
<p>Here, you evidently mean, in context, that they
<br>
turn out not to be friends of the U.S.  The
<br>
decision about Libra's Qadhdhafi had to have
<br>
been made during the cold war;  therefore it
<br>
becomes interesting to ponder why he turned
<br>
against his benefactor.  This (if I'm correct
<br>
so far) could imply that there exists genuine
<br>
and strong anti-U.S. elements of the population,
<br>
one of whose main motives is to be simply anti-
<br>
U.S.  An excellent book I'm reading, &quot;World on
<br>
Fire&quot;, describes the unfortunate aspects of
<br>
globalization on most countries around the world,
<br>
and goes into detail about this kind of thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid that the USA is going to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; such a mistake again in Iraq. The USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; support of Khoei is fueling my fears.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What would be the attributes of a &quot;good&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choice, and why do you think that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible for any choice to create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; situation in Iraq that would meet with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our hopes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ^^^^Attributes of a &quot;good&quot; choice.  Hm.  Very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard question.  Very hard.  It is hard for me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to imagine.
</em><br>
<p>Well, then, this certainly weakens your criticism
<br>
of the Rumsfeld choice (I've forgotten his name,
<br>
and don't really know anything about the situation).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me ask first what you mean by a good choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, what I would consider a good choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Iraq would most definitely not be what most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi's would consider a good choice for Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>Probably.  One of the points in the aforementioned
<br>
book I'm reading is that democracy and free markets
<br>
don't mix very well outside the already developed
<br>
countries.  In most Arab countries, for example,
<br>
the most rigid fundamentalists would win any general
<br>
election, and this, in the long run, (we here all
<br>
think), would not be beneficial to the people of
<br>
the country.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't think of a leadership/government in Iraq
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I believe could bridge all the conflicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious and cultural attitudes currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troubling the region.  Perhaps someone else can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of one; can you? I am not an Iraq hobby-ist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I am a bit of a pessimist when it comes to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle east.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, me too.  It may be a horrible choice between
<br>
chaos and a ruthless dictator.  If the latter, then
<br>
the most we may be able to ask for is that he rules
<br>
in such a way as to put his country on the best
<br>
possible road towards modernization.  In other words,
<br>
we might have to find a Shah-of-Iran clone.  The
<br>
people endure his oppression for a generation or
<br>
so, but he yields (perhaps at our behest) gradually
<br>
over time to liberalization.  I think that this is
<br>
what happened to Pinochet, who finally lost an 
<br>
election.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, I am not a student especially of Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My area of special interest (in my earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life) was mostly North Africa, specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libya.
</em><br>
<p>Well, hasn't Libya shown some progress?  I admit
<br>
that all I'm thinking of is that Qadhdhafi has
<br>
(internationally) seemed very reasonable lately.
<br>
He's denounced terrorism, and has taken
<br>
responsibility for the downed airliner over
<br>
Scotland, and has recompensated the survivors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry to be so uninformative. What about you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you favor any groups there?
</em><br>
<p>No, it's too complicated, and I haven't even spent
<br>
any time reading about the situation.  I'd be
<br>
prejudiced in favor of Bush's or Rumsfeld's choice,
<br>
however, as it seems to me they have shown the
<br>
greatest understanding of the situation there.
<br>
The war has so far gone about the way they thought,
<br>
and right now it does look like the effect on the
<br>
Arab world will be salutary.
<br>
<p>But it's too early to tell for sure, as hardly
<br>
needs to be said.  Everyone must guess what policies
<br>
will really lead to long term progress.  All I know
<br>
is that the United Nations-type policies are destined
<br>
to fail, because they use only carrots, and they and
<br>
their backers seem incapable of understanding the
<br>
role of sticks.
