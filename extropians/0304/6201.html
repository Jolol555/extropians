<p>*very* long term trend, perhaps.  I've seen studies saying that heights at
<br>
least didn't climb back up to pre-agricultural heights until the 20th century.
<br>
Between tall Cro-Magnons and tall agribusiness-fed Americans are a lot of
<br>
short people with bad teeth.  And not just the lower classes, necessarily.
<br>
The Art Institute of Chicago has a very stable exhibit in Gunsaulus Hall, full
<br>
of medieval armor and weapons.  What's interesting is that the suits of full
<br>
plate armor they have on display are about 5'2&quot;.  (Not exact number.  But
<br>
*short*.  You look over the helmet, then realize the armor is on a raised
<br>
platform to begin with.)
<br>
<p>And I've seen criticism of the common statement &quot;well, at least they were
<br>
better off than on the farm&quot; regarding the conditions of 19th century factory
<br>
workers.  It's not clear that the front line of workers, working 12+ hours a
<br>
day in dark factories and living in crowded and filthy tenements were better
<br>
off than they would have been on a farm.  Their grandchildren, yes, much
<br>
better off...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One is reminded of Robin Hanson's &quot;What if Uploads Come First?&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bleak (and to me slightly unbelievable) picture of how once
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Smart educated people command high incomes because they're rare and expensive
<br>
to produce.  If they become mass producible, a commodity even, why shouldn't
<br>
the price they command drop?  Just like music files on the internet.  Bits
<br>
want to be free...
