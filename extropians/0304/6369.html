Quoth Damien:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; $1.3B is not a &quot;tie&quot; with $1.98B.  That's a 52.3% difference.  The US's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aid to Israel in 2003 will be $2.1B.  And $12B is over 3x the US'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; total foreign military aid allocation.  Damien is conflating total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foreign aid figures with foreign military aid figures.  Confusion aside,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought we were *talking* about total foreign aid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
But the individual figures being quoted (1.3B, 1.98B) were military
<br>
aid figures.  So, there was confusion in one direction or the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where'd you get *that*?  $12 billion is close to the USA's total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foreign aid budget, and Israel is always described as the largest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recipient.  With Egypt second: $3 billion for Israel to $2 billion
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egypt.  Some web
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See?  Biggiest recipient of foreign aid, then I talk about total foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aid, with the numbers of Israel and Egypt which I've always heard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The later numbers seemed low, which I guess is explained if people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switched to only talking about military aid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yes, that would make the numbers appear low.
<br>
<p>Spike thinks we should include expenditures on toppling popularly-elected
<br>
governments and installing dictatorial puppet regimes (Iran, anyone?).
<br>
I can't see that this counts as &quot;aid.&quot;  But, if my experience with
<br>
individual humans (myself included) is at all applicable to international
<br>
relations (heh), simply giving people money is rarely helpful, as they
<br>
don't know what to do with it.
