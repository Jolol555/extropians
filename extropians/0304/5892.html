<p><em>&gt; Assume that all those poor people will riot and kill all

<em>&gt; I really like Bill Maher's approach to social justice

</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare,  &quot;Because they might kill you otherwise?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>It's true.  Many liberals do feel that by paying extortion
<br>
money they can relieve their guilt for having contributed
<br>
personally to the economy.  Why do they feel guilty?  Because
<br>
they look down on those not making as much as they do, and
<br>
believe that no change is possible.  Unlike the targets of
<br>
their sympathy, their &quot;nobless oblige&quot;, they really don't
<br>
think it's possible for poor people to get their act together.
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey quotes 
<br>
<p>&quot;[U.S.] High Incomers are paying an even larger share of income
<br>
taxes than in past years, according to the new IRS data from tax
<br>
returns for 2000, the most recent set it has analyzed.&quot;
<br>
<p>The data in the quote reads
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percentage of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top Percent                  All Taxes Paid
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1%                             37%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5%                             56%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%                             67%
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50%                             96%
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; While I am opposed to progressive taxes..., I have a suggestion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not just eliminate that bottom 50% of wage earners from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income tax?   It would amount to a 4% tax cut to income revenue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of which would be negated by how much would be saved by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IRS only dealing with 140 million people instead of 280 million.
</em><br>
<p>That's a brilliant idea!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any politician who proposed this on a presidential ticket could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get 140 million votes.  This would be a particularly wise move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Republicans in congress to present, as the overall change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tax burden is minimal... and Democrats will have a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to whine about wiped off their agenda.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  Probably the Republicans should do it *before* the
<br>
Democrats do, because why leave this great popular move for
<br>
them to reap the rewards of?
<br>
<p>Of course, then the bottom 51% will have absolutely no incentive
<br>
whatsoever to oppose tax increases, and since they are the 
<br>
beneficiaries of the redistributed monies, we can demolish
<br>
incentives all around, and complete the wrecking of the country
<br>
right away!   It's better than a slow death of a thousand jabs
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>Another idea is that since the top 5% pay 56% of the taxes
<br>
already (and that's not you and me!), let's just double 
<br>
their taxes and then no one but them will have to pay even
<br>
one penny.  Besides, they're rich and can afford to pay a
<br>
mere twice as much in taxes!

<br>
<p><em>&gt; The top 1% of filers paid 37% percent of all income taxes, up from 36%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the year before.  But they made just 21% of the total adjusted gross
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income.  An AGI of at least $313,400 was needed to be classified in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the top 1%.  The top 5% paid 56% of the total income taxes, and made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 35% of all AGI.  The each had an income of $128,300 or more.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upper 10% of all filers, those with an AGI of at least $92,100 bore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 67% of the income tax burden.  The bottom 50% of filers paid just 4%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of income taxes in 2000.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>(Note.  Many sentences of the above were sarcastic in nature---Lee)
