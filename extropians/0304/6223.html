<p>&quot;I'm sure that there we will miss scores of opportunities to gain the 
<br>
approval of the Iraqis and help them towards an ideal democracy.  Our 
<br>
mismanagement might result in starvation.  Our soldiers might be prejudiced 
<br>
against Arabs.  Our leader's speeches might slander the efforts that the 
<br>
Iraqis make in bringing themselves towards democracy.  In short, we might do 
<br>
just as bad a job of occupying Iraq as we 
<br>
did of occupying Japan after WWII.&quot;
<br>
<p>With all due respect, one can simply suggest that the scenarios of 
<br>
mismanagement you forecast &quot;might&quot; not happen, either. But more to the point, 
<br>
I would ask that you clarify your position regarding the &quot;bad job&quot; we did of 
<br>
occupying Japan after WWII. Last time I checked, Japan has been a stable 
<br>
democracy and free nation since 1952.
<br>
<p>Some highlights of our &quot;bad job&quot; of occupation include the granting of 
<br>
suffrage to women, with fourteen million of them going to the polls in April 
<br>
1946. In fact, thirty-nine women, including one well-known prostitute, were 
<br>
elected to the Diet. Additionally, MacArthur and Yoshida put an end to the 
<br>
&quot;absentee landlordism&quot; that so dominated the lives of Japanese farmers. By 
<br>
1950, ninety percent of Japanese farmland was owned by the farmers 
<br>
themselves. Beyond that, MacArthur dismissed over five thousand officers of 
<br>
Japan's secret police and established habeas corpus. Indeed, a truly dismal 
<br>
record.
<br>
<p>Regardless of the missteps that may occur along the way during the temporary 
<br>
occupation, the odds of Iraq becoming a flourishing democracy afterward are 
<br>
still a thousand times better than those had Saddam Hussein and his heirs 
<br>
remained in power.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;As we were driving on a deserted highway between Oiso and Tokyo, two 
<br>
American GIs suddenly appeared and signaled my driver to halt. I imagined 
<br>
them to be on some kind of marauding expedition, but they turned out to be 
<br>
soldiers returning to Tokyo who had lost their way. I offered to take them 
<br>
back to Tokyo.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We had not proceeded far before they were pressing chocolates, then chewing 
<br>
gum, and finally cigarettes upon me. I recall thinking at the time that it 
<br>
was the natural way of acting on their part, and the inherent good nature of 
<br>
the average American, which enabled the Occupation of Japan to be completed 
<br>
without a shot being fired.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
