<p>
I've resisted weighing in on this thread, but I think there are a
<br>
couple important point to make about human adaptation to the paleo
<br>
diet.
<br>
<p>1) Paleolithic humans had a life expectancy of around 18 years.  Just
<br>
because they were adapted to a certain diet doesn't mean that it's the
<br>
healthiest diet for those who want to live much longer lifespans.
<br>
<p>2) Related to point 1: Evolution selects for traits that maximized
<br>
survival to reproduction, total lifetime fertility, and little else.
<br>
Selection ceases after last age of reproduction.  Selection is
<br>
progressively weaker as less of the population is alive.  Since we
<br>
believe that only about 10 - 15% of the paleolithic population made it
<br>
to age 40, and few of those survivors were reproducing, evolutionary
<br>
theory tells us very little about what's healthy for humans past that
<br>
age.
<br>
<p>3) Humans are adapted to an environment with no antibiotics, no basic
<br>
sanitation, minimal artificial heating and cooling, etc...   However,
<br>
each of those innovations has dramatically increases life expectancy.
<br>
<p>So basically I don't see much value in pointing out that we're
<br>
evolutionarily adapted to a particular diet.  That might mean
<br>
something or it might not. I put more faith in large scale studies in
<br>
a more modern environment.
<br>
<p>Those studies indicate that regular cardiovascular exercise, moderate
<br>
caloric consumption, low consumption of refined sugar, low consumption
<br>
of saturated and oxidized fats, and high consumption of fruits,
<br>
vegetables, and whole grains are all associated with higher life
<br>
expectancy.
