<em>&gt; No, no, no...you don't need a complex physics theory when simple biology
</em><br>

At last, the real question has been answered! It is obvious that the socks 
<br>
find there way from the washing machine to a nearby kitchen draw. This purely 
<br>
nocturnal and unwitnessed activity results in a laval nest where the socks 
<br>
pupate. When the metamorphosis from sock to hanger is complete, they shed 
<br>
there protective 'plastic carrier bag' skin leaving us with the mysterious 
<br>
draw full of bags that is seen in virtually every home. The vast and varied 
<br>
breads of sock and hanger can be seen by the huge array of distinct markings 
<br>
on the outer surface of the pupation bags.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I believe the activity of the adult hangers is also nocturnal as they are 
<br>
often found with a bare foot during a nightime pitch black trip to the 
<br>
bathroom. Perhaps they are foraging for there favourite snack. that being the 
<br>
scrunched up tissues that find there way under the bed?
<br>
<p>Ahh the wonders of nature.
