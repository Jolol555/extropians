During his audience on June 10th 2002 with the Pope, Dr. Montagnier
<br>
gave the Pontiff a papaya extract to take to help improve his Parkinson's
<br>
disease. What Dr. Montagnier gave the Pope is a product called Immun'Age FPP
<br>
(Fermented Papaya Preparation), which is manufactured by a Japanese company
<br>
called Osato. Immun'Age is produced from non-genetically modified papayas
<br>
that are grown in Hawaii. The papayas undergo a fermentation process and are
<br>
then dried and ground into a fine powder. The final product is packed in
<br>
3-gram foil packs. Immun'Age was first developed in 1969, and has been on
<br>
the Japanese market for about the last 10 years. It is sold primarily as an
<br>
immune booster. Dr. Montagnier feels that the product's ability to scavenge
<br>
free radicals is what makes it effective in helping Parkinson's disease. He
<br>
has also started testing the product in AIDS patients in Africa. So far, the
<br>
studies have been on very small groups, but the results appear to be very
<br>
positive. When used in combination with AIDS drugs, it seems to stimulate
<br>
immune activity. There are also indications that it helps with weight gain
<br>
and improved hemoglobin levels. Larger, more extensive trials are currently
<br>
planned.
<br>
Dr. Montagnier recommended that the Pope take two sachets, or packets, of
<br>
the powder daily - one in the morning and another in the evening. For best
<br>
results, the powder should be dumped under the tongue and taken on an empty
<br>
stomach. Dr. Montagnier says that whenever he first feels a cold coming on
<br>
he immediately takes two sachets, which stops the cold before it gets
<br>
started. This seems to work only if it is taken at the very first sign of a
<br>
cold.
