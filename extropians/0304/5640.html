Perhaps one needs to consider that force, call it coercion, exists on a 
<br>
scale.  We may not yet have a good calibration for it, or a decent 
<br>
meter, but clearly offering bread to a starving man, but insisting that 
<br>
he do something first counts a some degree of coercion.  And threatening 
<br>
a well armed man with a club does, also.  And screaming at a child.  And 
<br>
this ranges must include everything up to words of praise for trying to 
<br>
perform correctly, and down to torturing someone to death for failing to 
<br>
satisfy your whims instantly (without your bothering to inform them).  
<br>
These are all acts along a scale of coercion, though I can't place all 
<br>
of them in order.  Somewhere along that scale will be the billboards.
<br>
<p>Is the scale continuous?  (Or essentially continuous to the limit of 
<br>
human perception?)  Is it reasonable to pick one place along the scale, 
<br>
and say &quot;Everything below this is unethical, everything above it is 
<br>
ethical&quot;?  Clearly some positions on the scale are considered unethical 
<br>
by nearly everyone.  Likewise other positions are considered ethical by 
<br>
nearly everyone.  But it's not obvious to me that there is a clear line 
<br>
of demarcation.  Perhaps acts of coercion are merely more ethical or 
<br>
less ethical that other acts.  And I notice that I didn't consider the 
<br>
expected consequences of the various acts.  If those are an important 
<br>
component, then things get a lot more complicated.  But if they aren't, 
<br>
then what is the value of the scale?
<br>
<p>Then there are other components.  After someone has purchased an 
<br>
expensive house with a magnificent view, is it his neighbor's right to 
<br>
build a high fence?  How high?  This isn't coercion, but it's certainly 
<br>
provokation.  So perhaps the model is too simple...
<br>
<p>Simple words and traditional concepts are more suited to understanding 
<br>
things quickly than to understanding them correctly.  It's rather like 
<br>
the army rule for officers: &quot;Make a quick decision, and be certain.  If 
<br>
you happen to be right, so much the better.&quot;  And that has merit if you 
<br>
are trying to act quickly.  But if you are trying to make a 
<br>
philosophical analysis, it induces oversimplified reasoning.  This is a 
<br>
good part of why physics shifted over to mathematical models.  But when 
<br>
we can't measure things, what are the alternatives?
