<p>Welcome to the discussion.
<br>
<p>I agree. Sad thing, too. Most people have come to believe that the modern
<br>
American diet is perfectly natural and thus the default diet. And yet here
<br>
we are in the midst of a national health crisis. Obesity and diabetes have
<br>
reached epidemic proportions. Something is very wrong, and you can be very
<br>
sure that the dairy and grain industries are not going to help us identify
<br>
the problem. In fact they will fight very hard through their lobbyists to
<br>
suppress any movement at the national level to correct the American diet.
<br>
Also our economy is so heavily dependent on dairy and agriculture that
<br>
pulling the rug out from under them would likely sink us into a depression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am curious what knowledgeable paleodiet proponents think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caloric restriction. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't know that paleodiet theorists have any consensus opinion on the
<br>
subject, but this paleodiet theorist believes caloric restriction works as
<br>
an adaptive mechanism to increase the probability of producing offspring.
<br>
Faced with apparent famine, the body shifts gears in order to live longer to
<br>
produce offspring at some time in the future when food may again be
<br>
plentiful and offspring can be reared. Evidence is strong that longevity
<br>
from CR is inversely proportional to procreation.
