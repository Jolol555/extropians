::This seems like TechnoRapture thinking to me.  &quot;We don't need to worry 
<br>
about
<br>
that problem because we'll have it solved soon.  Somehow.&quot;
<br>
-xx- Damien X-)   ::
<br>
<p>Yes, handwaving; that's what we are tuned into because we ain't got the bucks 
<br>
to make most of this futuristic stuff happen, ourselves. Yet, it still seems 
<br>
worth considering, because a small portion of technical development will 
<br>
occur. Darwinian randomness, combined with cultural norms, which motivate 
<br>
economics and, thus, direct research and development produce technological, 
<br>
industrial advances, and scientific achievements. War, frequently also 
<br>
produces such a stimulus, as we all well know.
<br>
<p>But I count war as part of cultural norms. Darwinian randomness is the 
<br>
serrendipity-euraka moment that sometimes occurs. Darwinian randomness is 
<br>
also, sometimes, the choice of the marketplace, and sometimes it is how 
<br>
products are marketed. For example, the French Minitel kind of chat thingy, 
<br>
was never really offered in the USA, but culturally, has been a hit in France 
<br>
(I'm Thrilled!)  The Japanese were/are the 1st to make it big with instant 
<br>
messaging/games for &quot;video displays on pagers,&quot; In the US, we're slower to 
<br>
adopt this. Maybe the most successful technological innovators might be India 
<br>
or Europe or Brazil, given a few decades.
<br>
<p>My guess is that given enough time, human beings, or the techno-raptured 
<br>
robots will 
<br>
come up with interesting solutions. If we get wiped-out by the sun increasing 
<br>
its brightness (surely not an anthrogenic cause!), then the Kyoto Accord 
<br>
mentality wouldn't have mattered, anyway.
