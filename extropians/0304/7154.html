<p>This &quot;bright idea&quot; seems very unlikely to me.  Much more plausible is that
<br>
people were eating grains casually already, possibly even engaging in a bit of
<br>
low-effort horticulture, and selection happened naturally.  Fatter grains got
<br>
gathered more often, allowing for more of their seeds to be dropped near the
<br>
village (hunter-gatherer mobility is inversely correlated with local
<br>
productivity; they're not necessarily nomadic, just when they have to be.
<br>
Which would have been less in the Fertile Crescent back then.)  to be gathered
<br>
and brought back all over again.  Do this long enough and you've got major
<br>
changes in the grains, ready to fall back on when the rising sea levels cause
<br>
sudden crowding along with the climate-change disruptions in food supply.
<br>
<p>Jane Jacobs had her own twist on this, with lots of people going to an early
<br>
trade city like Catalhuyuk, bringing their own foods with them and a jump in
<br>
hybridization around the city.
