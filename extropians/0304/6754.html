<em>&gt; Yes of course, the tendency to warfare and violence is part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human nature then and now. Again I was objecting only to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea that the naive hunting of a species to extinction is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence of that destructive nature. Are you really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting Diamond thinks it is? Or are you stating that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amazon reviewer was flatly mistaken to call it Diamond's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view? I'm sorry your message is not very clear to me in this
</em><br>
respect.
<br>
<p>I think the Amazon reviewer was twisting Diamond's view.  
<br>
<p>It's tough for me to give a simple response because the word
<br>
&quot;destructive&quot; just strikes me as imprecise in this case (and I think
<br>
would strike Diamond as imprecise as well).  A human characteristic
<br>
isn't necessarily destructive in and of itself.  In one environment a
<br>
characteristic can be useful and adaptive.  In another environment it
<br>
can be dangerous.
<br>
<p>Human hunting skills seem to have been just such a trait.  In Eurasia
<br>
and Africa, the local animals had co-evolved with humans and
<br>
proto-humans and had thus developed survival traits of their own (like
<br>
fear of humans).  The fauna in Australia and the Americas, by
<br>
contrast, had evolved in an environment that lacked humans.  So early
<br>
hunters in Australia could literally walk up to a local animal and
<br>
knock it on the head.
<br>
<p>So is the human hunting urge destructive?  Not really - it was
<br>
necessary for our survival as a species.  It was the combination of
<br>
this trait and the spread to a new environment that had lacked
<br>
predators as skilled as us that resulted in the extinction of the
<br>
Australian mega-fauna.
