<em>&gt; My apologies.  I am not usually that short.  But a claim of 95% 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein in lean turkey is a bit over the top.  Much of what you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have said on this subject is quite good and thought provoking. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how making claims like this add anything worthwhile. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes, I can google up stuff that claims such high numbers, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not using really accepted methodology as far as I can tell.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, he claimed 94%. According the the USDA Food and Nutrition
<br>
Information Center, an 84g serving of what they call &quot;Turkey, all
<br>
classes, light meat, roasted&quot; has 132 calories, 2.7g of fat, and
<br>
25.12g of protein, which would make calories from protein just over
<br>
80%. I'm not sure how whatever product he's calling &quot;lean turkey
<br>
breast&quot; compares to what the USDA was measuring, but it wouldn't
<br>
surprize me if such a product could be produced that pushed the
<br>
number up to 94%. It would probably be more honest to quote the 80%
<br>
figure.
<br>
<p>But his initial point was to counter your statement that there
<br>
were some &quot;greens and beans&quot; that were comparable protein sources.
<br>
According the same USDA database, the highest-protein bean I could
<br>
find listed was &quot;Soybeans, mature, boiled, without salt&quot;, which
<br>
came in at about 50% calories from protein.
