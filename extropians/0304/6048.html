</em><br>
<p>I assume anyone following this thread will have read Ross Anderson's
<br>
TCPA/Palladium FAQ.  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tcpa-faq.html">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tcpa-faq.html</a>
<br>
<p>Of course, you're both right... in particular, you're right about the
<br>
benign uses of TCPA, and Ross is right about the POTENTIAL for serious
<br>
rights violations.  In particular, when Ross says
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Under Palladium] pirate software can be detected and deleted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;remotely. It will also make it easier for people to rent software
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than buying it; and if you stop paying the rent, then not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;only does the software stop working but so may the files it created.
<br>
<p>he'd be seriously wrong to think that having TCPA installed will
<br>
automatically make this possible.  TCPA is necessary, but not
<br>
sufficient, to bring about a world in which Microsoft &quot;owns&quot; your PC.
<br>
<p>In particular, you're right that it needn't be the case that
<br>
submitting your upload to a TCPA-enabled machine will make your upload
<br>
owned by MS...  but that's a misleading analogy.
<br>
<p>In the case where you're deciding whether or not to distribute your
<br>
data to a TC machine, you yourself are in the role of Microsoft, not
<br>
in the role of an average user.  You want to ensure that anyone to
<br>
whom you transfer your software only has the right to do with it what
<br>
YOU want.
<br>
<p>[It's interesting to note that this Prudent Upload case, in which an
<br>
upload tries to ensure that it runs on a machine that obeys common
<br>
moral codes, turns on its head a very natural libertarian idea about
<br>
data/information: that, once you've acquired data in a legitimate way,
<br>
you're free to do whatever you want with that data on your own system,
<br>
in much the same way that you have the right to your own thoughts and
<br>
to your own speech/property.  In the Prudent Upload case, we may
<br>
acknowledge that *the data itself has rights*, so the libertarian
<br>
ideal of ensuring that data is as free as free speech is inappropriate
<br>
in this case.  Uploads want all the same sorts of powers that dirty
<br>
people currently want to use to control your machine: they want to
<br>
ensure that you don't do anything &quot;immoral&quot; to data that is
<br>
transferred to you.  (As for my take, I think that the jury is still
<br>
out on the question of whether is it can be moral to use your own
<br>
hardware to run cruel simulations, in which your software entities are
<br>
made to suffer, assuming that these simulations are &quot;victimless&quot; to
<br>
anyone else on your metaphysical level.)]
<br>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; you may say, &quot;but it only gives people the power to prove to
<br>
you, the upload, that they're going to agree to your terms... it
<br>
doesn't actually *force* them to do what you say.&quot;  But it *does* if
<br>
they're in some way forced to run the TCPA architecture of your
<br>
choosing.  In particular, if the government forces us to run
<br>
centrally-signed OSes on TCPA-enabled machines, the game is over.
<br>
<p>&quot;So what?&quot; you may argue.  &quot;The government could force me to run
<br>
Windows with BigBrother Inside! (tm) tomorrow, couldn't it?&quot;  No,
<br>
probably not, or at least, not that easily.  In particular, there'd be
<br>
nothing they could reasonably do to prevent you from hacking up your
<br>
own OS and running it on your own machine; they could pass the law,
<br>
but they couldn't (at present) enforce it.  TCPA thus represents the
<br>
possibility of an enforcement mechanism for bad laws like the CBDTPA.
<br>
<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/03/29/hollings_bill/">http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/03/29/hollings_bill/</a>
<br>
<p><p>So, to trace this back to the upload analogy: if you, the upload, are
<br>
in charge of the federal TC administration, then there's no worry that
<br>
your uploaded code would be &quot;owned&quot; by somebody else.  In that case,
<br>
YOU'RE the very entity we're afraid of... you needn't be worried under
<br>
the Palladium architecture.  (Indeed, you can rest easy, knowing that
<br>
others will be forced to use your data in whatever way you think to be
<br>
right.)
<br>
<p>If, on the other hand, you are not in charge of the FTCA, then,
<br>
clearly, you and your code would be &quot;owned&quot; by the central signatory.
<br>
If that code did something that you didn't like, then there's nothing
<br>
you could ever do about it.  You couldn't make a contract with someone
<br>
with a TCPA machine for them to do what you wanted unless that agreed
<br>
with what the central signatory required.
<br>
<p><p>Now, there is a somewhat more benign case than the one in which the
<br>
government forces you to run signed code: there's the one in which the
<br>
software being offered by Microsoft and friends is enticing, but to
<br>
get use of it, you have to hand MS the keys to your machine.  If an OS
<br>
like this simply becomes the de facto standard, then the freedom of
<br>
ordinary users will be greatly diminished, probably without their
<br>
noticing or realizing it.  (In much the same way that users' rights to
<br>
privacy are often assaulted today without their knowledge... but
<br>
perhaps this is because they simply don't care.)
<br>
<p>One perfectly plausible consequence of the TCPA is that TC itself
<br>
could be one of the value-added features that you only get *if* you
<br>
hand over the keys to your machine to MS at install time.  Then, under
<br>
TCPA, you could at least arrange contracts with other machine owners
<br>
to accept and use your upload data in whatever way you required, so
<br>
long as that didn't disagree with what MS wanted.  If you wanted to
<br>
arrange a contract which MS did not wish to allow, your partners would
<br>
have to turn off TCPA altogether in order to follow through with your
<br>
request, vitiating their (admittedly valuable) capacity to prove their
<br>
trustworthiness to you.
<br>
<p>Perhaps, in principle, this outcome is morally acceptable: people in a
<br>
free market would be trading off a few of their rights (rights that
<br>
they maybe wouldn't even notice missing, that's how much they care
<br>
about them!) in exchange for cool features.
<br>
<p>It seems bad to me, though.
