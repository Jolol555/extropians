<em>&gt;&gt; With respect to this thread, my point is simply that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's fine for you, gts, but it doesn't convince me.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to convince someone else, you always have to

</em><br>
<p>Exactly. The burden of proof is always on those who challenge the prevailing
<br>
belief-system. In a previous post I was merely *asking* you to consider that
<br>
the paleodiet should be the default diet in need of rebuttal as opposed to
<br>
the modern diet, given that you had just *agreed* with me that the primary
<br>
tenet of paleodiet theory is true: that there was a significant decline in
<br>
health at the onset of agriculture and dairy. You never answered that post
<br>
of mine, by the way. 
<br>
<p>In another relevant post I was *agreeing* with Eliezer, who typed some words
<br>
that agreed with me, something to effect of &quot;I tend to think the ancestral
<br>
diet should be the assumption that must be disproved.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Harvey then jumped in and muddied the waters a bit with the false charge I
<br>
was trying to impose the burden of proof on everyone here to prove me wrong.
<br>
(Harvey and I have since cleared up that misunderstanding, I think). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My belief, founded on the latest and largest studies of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlation between diet and health, is that a diet of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrequent lean meat, low saturated fat, lots of fruits and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetables, and a reasonable amount of high-fiber whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grains is the best we know of in terms of longevity.
</em><br>
<p>I would ask you to please define &quot;infrequent&quot; in terms % of calories from
<br>
lean meat, and the same for &quot;low&quot; and &quot;lots&quot; and &quot;reasonable&quot; for saturated
<br>
fat, fruits and vegetables, and fiber respectively. Also please explain why
<br>
plant fiber from whole grains is necessary when you're already getting
<br>
plenty of it from what is presumably a lot of fruits and vegetables. We'll
<br>
know then exactly how your belief differs from the typical belief of
<br>
paleodiet theorists.
<br>
<p>Also see my last message to Harvey, in which I (for a second or third time
<br>
in this thread in messages to third parties) agree with your excellent
<br>
observation about natural selection having been blind in paleo times to many
<br>
of the diseases of aging.
