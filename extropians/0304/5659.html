Damien Sullivan responded to me:
<br>
<p>&quot;Points I'd make: the influence of the US is larger than the actions of its
<br>
government. I'd say the major part of any American influence toward democracy
<br>
is simply from existing, and from saturating the world with our popular
<br>
culture, and being so big that everyone has to pay attention to us. When you
<br>
have arrested people in other countries screeching for their Miranda rights
<br>
you know we've done something good.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would agree in large part with what you have said here. However, I would 
<br>
qualify that by offering that this is far more true now than during the Cold 
<br>
War era, in which our existence and our government both provided vital roles 
<br>
for the continued spread of democracy abroad.
<br>
<p>&quot;When you look at government action it's much less rosy. Sure, we're better
<br>
than the Soviet Union. That doesn't take much. (And for the record, the
<br>
Soviet bloc seemed to have better education than we do.)&quot;
<br>
<p>This is a point that could be debated further, but even if it were true, I 
<br>
would say &quot;so what?&quot; I'm sure the Soviets had far more organized bread lines 
<br>
too, but that hardly would make their system better than ours. But more to 
<br>
the point, there was more to what I was saying than just our quality of life 
<br>
was (and is) better than our Soviet counterparts. The foreign policy 
<br>
decisions of the United States government during the Cold War era must be 
<br>
viewed from a perspective that includes the corresponding decisions made in 
<br>
Moscow, and a general acknowledgment that the world of that era was one in 
<br>
which democracies were in the distinct minority.
<br>
<p>&quot;We've also overthrown elected governments, propped up dictators, trained 
<br>
death squads,
<br>
and turned a blind eye to abuses by our allies.&quot;
<br>
<p>All of these accusations are to some degrees true. However, I do not see any 
<br>
perspective given to any of these judgments you have passed. For instance, 
<br>
the United States &quot;propped up&quot; the regime of Syngman Rhee in South Korea in 
<br>
1950. Rhee was certainly an authoritarian and a thug. For instance, he had 
<br>
executed in 1950 2000 of his own subjects without trial because they were 
<br>
believed to be aiding the Communists. Should the United States not have 
<br>
&quot;propped up&quot; this authoritarian? Would a more preferable outcome in your view 
<br>
have been one in which the United States washed their hands of the unsavory 
<br>
Rhee regime and allowed Kim Il Sung's North to forcibly reunify that nation? 
<br>
I would simply ask would you prefer that the US not dealt with this 
<br>
authoritarian, at the cost that all of Korea today would be undemocratic? 
<br>
Certainly over the course of the last fifty years the United States has made 
<br>
decisions abroad that are quite difficult, if not impossible, to defend. But, 
<br>
when looked at in terms of the very real Cold War dynamic that existed during 
<br>
that time, most of them can be understood.
<br>
<p>&quot;The State Department's report on human rights came out yesterday, and Human 
<br>
Rights Watch said &quot;it's a fine report, but is the US guided by it the other 
<br>
364 days of the year?&quot; Sometimes
<br>
we speak up, sometimes we don't. We isolate Cuba, but trade with China, which
<br>
I think is a worse regime.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me say that it can be persuasively argued that our approach to Cuba 
<br>
should be re-examined. But let me also say that it is absurd to blame the 
<br>
decades of inequality and poverty suffered by the Cuban people on the United 
<br>
States and not the Castro regime and the Soviets which propped him up for 
<br>
four decades. I would also suggest that it is not realistic to apply the same 
<br>
standards with regard to our behavior toward Cuba and China. China is the 
<br>
world's most populous nation, has achieved nuclear status, and is an emerging 
<br>
world and economic power. The United States cannot realistically be expected 
<br>
to give more than lip service toward its internal human rights violations, 
<br>
just as was unfortunately the case with the Soviet Union.
<br>
<p>&quot;And US influence, or US government action in the past, isn't a full
<br>
determinant of what the US government is doing now or will do. One could
<br>
believe the US has done tons of great things in the past and also believe the
<br>
Bush administration is wrecking that record right and left.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is certainly a legitimate point worth debate. I obviously do not 
<br>
subscribe to it, however. I cannot place the Bush administration's decision 
<br>
to forcibly remove a tyrannical regime in Iraq for defensive purposes next to 
<br>
the crushing of the Prague Spring by the Soviets, for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; States is deplorable. The freedoms that each and every human enjoys on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet (those fortunate enough to enjoy some) can all be attributed to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree to the United States. Yet some insist that merely because the US (or 
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;They can also be attributed to some degree to Great Britain which spawned 
<br>
us,
<br>
and to France which spread Revolutionary values throughout Europe. I know you
<br>
didn't say the US was the unique fount of freedom, but I thought I'd make the
<br>
points anyway.&quot;
<br>
<p>I did not say the United States was, nor would I ever. Despite that, your 
<br>
point here is something that should be noted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; any other country) is powerful and in a dominant world position, than it is 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; bad, or &quot;might makes wrong&quot;, in huMania's words. This position too is not 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;power corrupts&quot; in the usual formulation.
<br>
<p>Perhaps it is the usual formation, but it is not universally applicable. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; acceptable in any form to many on this list, and the record of the United 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States as compared to other major world powers, most notably the Soviet 
</em><br>
Union 
<br>
<em>&gt; or Nazi Germany, is a necessary part of illustrating why the position of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;might makes wrong&quot; is not appropriate in all cases.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;We have a better record; yay us. It's not a perfect record.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nor have I ever said it was, however, I think it inappropriate to dismiss out 
<br>
of hand with a &quot;yay us&quot; the significant and vital role the United States has 
<br>
played in helping to promote and sustain viable democracies in the 20th 
<br>
Century. For starters, there are 70 million people now living in Taiwan and 
<br>
South Korea who would not have democracy today if not for the actions in the 
<br>
past and present of the United States. This is a fact worth far more than a 
<br>
footnote.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;And I think it's a legitimate fear is that if we've resisted the corrupting 
<br>
effect of power
<br>
until now, it's finally come to bite us. Or at least to bite the neocons who
<br>
dream of American empire.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is at best speculation, and at worst a simple partisan attack. The 
<br>
&quot;world community&quot; saw fit to demand that Saddam Hussein disarm, whatever 
<br>
their differences in opinion on how best that goal should have been 
<br>
accomplished. The United States was not going to leave a few hundred thousand 
<br>
troops on Mr. Hussein's doorstep so Hans Blix could continue to collect a 
<br>
paycheck and hope that the regime disarmed. It will take far more than the 
<br>
removal of an obstinate tyrant to validate your claims of &quot;neocon dreams of 
<br>
empire.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Illustrating that the United States helped foster and make possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy in Taiwan, Greece, South Korea, Japan, etc. is not &quot;holding up a 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Greece was democratic. Then it had a military coup in the 1960s or 1970s.
<br>
Then at some point it wandered back to democracy. What role, if any, did we
<br>
play in that?&quot;
<br>
<p>I would respectfully suggest that the over 400 million dollars that the 
<br>
United States provided in economic and military aid to the royalist 
<br>
government of Greece during their civil war of 1947-49 with the Communists 
<br>
&quot;had something to do with it.&quot; It is highly unlikely that Greece would have 
<br>
been able to &quot;wander back to democracy&quot; from a Communist system before the 
<br>
fall of the Soviet Union. Perhaps you would disagree, but I would then ask 
<br>
that you provide some examples in which Communist regimes willingly gave up 
<br>
power prior to the fall of the USSR.
<br>
<p>Indeed, the removal of the Allende regime in a CIA supported coup in Chile, 
<br>
often trumpeted by those who perpetually criticize United States foreign 
<br>
policy, provides an interesting contrast between the US and Soviet camps. 
<br>
Perhaps Salvadore Allende might have presided over a prosperous and healthy 
<br>
Chile and willingly surrendered power. That will be never be known. It cannot 
<br>
be argued, however, that Allende's programs of nationalizing businesses and 
<br>
initiating &quot;land reform&quot; was met with widespread protest and demonstrations 
<br>
by his people. Nor should it be surprising that these steps concerned the 
<br>
United States. The decision by our government to support the tyrannical 
<br>
Pinochet regime can and should be rigorously debated. However, it should be 
<br>
noted that Pinochet's regime promulgated a constitution that eventually 
<br>
called for democratic elections and that he was in fact voted out of office. 
<br>
I am still waiting for the first democratic elections in Vietnam, Laos, and 
<br>
North Korea. 
<br>
<p>dominated by the USSR, while a great many proxies of the United States did 
<br>
<em>&gt; indeed develop lasting and stable democracies. It is completely legitimate 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;For example, Iran, a US proxy, had a revolution and established a democracy
<br>
which while highly imperfect is real and more than most of the Middle East
<br>
has.&quot;
<br>
<p>I will certainly strenuously argue with your contention if need be, but I 
<br>
would first ask if you seriously believe that the Mullahs are in anyway 
<br>
vulnerable to losing their 24 year grip on power through this &quot;democracy&quot; you 
<br>
suggest is present in Iran.
<br>
