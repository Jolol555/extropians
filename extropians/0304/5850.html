From the Globe and Mail:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A new study by researchers at the Universities of California and Miami
<br>
shows that people who consciously remind themselves every day of the
<br>
things they are grateful for show marked improvements in mental health
<br>
and some aspects of physical health, reports The Dallas Morning News. The
<br>
results appear to be equally true for healthy college students and people
<br>
with incurable diseases, according to research published in the Journal
<br>
of Personality and Social Psychology. Compared with groups of subjects
<br>
who counted hassles, such as &quot;hard-to-find parking&quot;, grateful subjects
<br>
felt better about their lives and more optimistic. The college students
<br>
exercised more; the chronically ill adults reported sleeping longer and
<br>
waking up refreshed. Being grateful was also superior to its distant
<br>
cousin - seeing oneself as better off than others. people who took
<br>
pleasure in the troubles of others - Schadenfreude - had better mental
<br>
health than those who counted hassles, but worse than grateful people.
