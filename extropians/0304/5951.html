<p>Michael Wilk responds

<p><em>&gt; The term 'neocon' shows up in lewrockwell.com articles almost every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single day, and has for months. So, I gather you have not read any of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; site. Neocons have been portrayed as basically communists, specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trotskyists, with their penchant for reshaping the world through war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find it difficult to believe that anyone interested in learning about
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems more reasonable to think you are uninterested. I read all sorts of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Like Michael I'm surprised that haven't come accross this term before, and
<br>
not just in connection with the war. &quot;Neo Conservative&quot; has been in wide
<br>
usage for about twenty years now to describe a small but very influential
<br>
group of US intellectuals who were originally on the political left but
<br>
moved to the right during the late 70s/early 80s. (Most of them were
<br>
previously &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson Democrats). It's foreign policy issues that have
<br>
moved them to the right, on domestic affairs they are &quot;big government
<br>
conservatives&quot;. Some of them do use the term themselves e.g. Irving Kristol
<br>
who entitled one of his books &quot;Confessions of a Neo-Conservative&quot;. The
<br>
&quot;Weekly Standard&quot; is their main mouthpiece. Lots of books about them, just
<br>
do a keyword search in Amazon.

</em><br>
<p>That's my view exactly. Like Mike I think it's now very dangerous to have
<br>
low trust societies with access to modern tech both for them and us
<br>
(actually I think the real problem is societies that have high trust for
<br>
relatives, low trust for everyone else). However agreeing on the end leaves
<br>
lots of room for argument about means and I think relying on force as your
<br>
principal strategy is very risky and possibly self-defeating.
