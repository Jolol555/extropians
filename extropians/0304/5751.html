</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Evolution only works to develop improvements by diversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That must explain all those lambs that are part of all lion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prides these days.
</em><br>
<p>Humor aside, lions couldn't exist without other animals to eat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Capitalism only develops better products by diversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How true. I have never seen a firm improve its competitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position by focusing on just one product.
</em><br>
<p>A single firm doesn't need diversity in its portfolio, but the market as a
<br>
whole does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Think tanks only think up new ideas by diversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly! And that is exactly why all the think tanks have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jettisoned their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past policies of only hiring degreed people, and have started
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiring half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their faculty from the non-degreed homeless street person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you equate diversity with unqualified people?  Nothing about
<br>
diversity implies allowing less qualified people into the firm.  Diversity
<br>
means having people think outside the box or think differently than others.
<br>
This is exactly what a think-tank needs.  If they hire all graduates from a
<br>
single university who all think alike, they would never produce new ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Human thought, art, philosophy, and creative thought only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occur because of diversity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly! That is why every successful artist, philosopher and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinker only devotes a small fraction of their lives to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artistry, philosophy and &quot;thinking.&quot; The rest of the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do things like work at the post office and rollerblade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the mall on weekends.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that any successful artist, philosopher or thinker has succeeded by
<br>
working full time on their main works to the exclusion of other life
<br>
experience.  Great artists, philosophers and thinkers tend to have
<br>
complicated and diverse experiences from which they draw upon to create new
<br>
synthesis of ideas.  A person with a single viewpoint or a monotonous life
<br>
will produce boring one-dimensional works.
