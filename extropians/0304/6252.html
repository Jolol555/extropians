I've been reading extropians for about... 2yr?  Something like that.
<br>
Here goes my first post...
<br>
<p>I'm kind of alarmed at how I see figures of US foreign military aid
<br>
being factually confused and contextually misrepresented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From <a href="http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/aid_db.htm">http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/aid_db.htm</a> :
</em><br>
<p>FMF Budget Request FY 2001:  Total budget request:  $3.54 billion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget request for Israel: $1.98 billion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget request for Egypt: $1.3 billion
<br>
<p>$1.3B is not a &quot;tie&quot; with $1.98B.  That's a 52.3% difference.  The US's
<br>
aid to Israel in 2003 will be $2.1B.  And $12B is over 3x the US'
<br>
total foreign military aid allocation.  Damien is conflating total
<br>
foreign aid figures with foreign military aid figures.  Confusion aside,
<br>
Israel's military strength is, in fact, the single largest item on the US'
<br>
foreign military aid agenda.  Our military aid to Israel represents 20%
<br>
of their $9.8B military budget which is, in turn, almost 10% of their GDP.
<br>
Pretty crazy.  There are really some heads in need of busting over there,
<br>
apparently.
<br>
<p>But it sure beats adding the cost of military presence in the oil-
<br>
producing region to OWN military budget, that'd really clue people
<br>
in.  But wait, we just DID add the cost of military presence in the
<br>
oil-producing region to our own military budget!
<br>
<p>It's cute that people think this isn't about oil, economy and empire.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Where'd you get *that*?  $12 billion is close to the USA's total
&gt; &gt; foreign aid
&gt; &gt; budget, and Israel is always described as the largest recipient.
&gt; &gt; With Egypt
&gt; &gt; second: $3 billion for Israel to $2 billion for Egypt.  Some web
searching
&gt; &gt; seems to confirm all this.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; You are correct, it appears I was off by a factor of ten, with
&gt; Egypt getting around 1.2 billion, which about ties it with Isreal.
&gt; My apologies, still waiting for my nueral upgrades, momentary lapses of
&gt; reason should be reduced then.
