<p>&nbsp;This seems to me to explain why (as far as we

can tell) the code disparity is in fact vastly harder for evolution to
<br>
solve than either of the other two hurdles.
<br>
<p>### We seem to agree that code disparity was the main problem in
<br>
transferring mt genes to the nucleus, although other factors like
<br>
hydrophobicity could play a role as well.

<p><p>This is news to me. Can you give references? This certainly flies in
<br>
the face of all I've ever come across on fatty streaks.

<br>
<p>I also dimly remember reading some Scientific American articles claiming
<br>
reversibility of fatty streaks. I think there were some experiments made on
<br>
the Watanabe rabbits some years ago, involving gene therapy, with regression
<br>
of lesions.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The only way you can tell there is totally indigestible stuff in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plaque is if you cannot digest it in vitro in cell culture
</em><br>
<p><p>True. As far as I'm aware, no one has done the simple experiment of
<br>
exposing macrophages to atheroma in culture and seeing what happens.
<br>
Or more likely, it was done 50 years ago and the result was boring...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; and if injected in vivo in a young animal, it doesn't get phagocytosed.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think you meant &quot;OR if injected ...&quot; -- clearly both phagocytosis and
<br>
digestion have to happen, either without the other is useless.
<br>
<p>### Yes.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; ### A different explanation is that there is a dynamic balance between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the influx of digestible fatty material, and the ability of endothelium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and macrophages to deal with it. As time goes by, the balance tilts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards buildup, with first only occasional macrophages dying, then as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the quality of macrophages goes down with age (and it does), there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't enough to deal with plaque even if it's still digestible, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of scarring, and calcification.
</em><br>
<p><p>I disagree that this is an explanation, because it doesn't explain why
<br>
fatty streaks appear in childhood. Any process of accumulating damage
<br>
(e.g. junk like this) that is already easily detectable in early life
<br>
is by definition primary, not brought on by the misfortune of inhabiting
<br>
the same body as a bunch of other aging tissues (and thus experiencing
<br>
a tilting of a dynamic balance).
<br>
<p>### Genetically determined obesity (e.g leptin deficiency) manifests early
<br>
in life, and yet we know that maintenance of body weight is a dynamic
<br>
balancing process, and can be tilted early or late in either direction. You
<br>
can have fatty streaks appearing early and developing very fast, if your LDL
<br>
is very high, in hereditary hypercholesterolemia, or they can develop
<br>
slower, if you have only the Western diet going against you. The balance can
<br>
be out of kilter because of hereditary, or acquired changes in your genome,
<br>
or due to non-genetic changes (like formation of insoluble aggregates). So
<br>
far we have insufficient data to answer the question of the specific
<br>
contribution of such factors in PD, AD, and, AFAIK, in most other
<br>
aging-related conditions.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chinnery and Turnbull did some calculations showing that mtDNA can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely fluctuate and fix mutations into homozygosity if only random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes are taken into account.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is one body of work regarding which I tend to have trouble being
<br>
diplomatic. Patrick Chinnery is an excellent medic, but suffice to say
<br>
that we discussed his hypothesis for accumulation by drift five years
<br>
ago, before he'd published anything embarrassing, and he's still having
<br>
trouble understanding the fundamental inconsistency of that model with
<br>
the data, viz. that it predicts that mitochondrial hyperproliferation
<br>
will precede (hence be seen in the absence of) COX-negativity, whereas
<br>
with the sole exception of the MELAS mutation (which seems to have a
<br>
special way to win) the reverse is true, we see abundant COX-negative
<br>
cells that lack any mitochondrial hyperproliferation.
<br>
<p>### My boss, Davis Parker, likes the idea of clonal expansion, too. Why do
<br>
you think COX negativity must precede hyperproliferation if this hypothesis
<br>
is true?
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; A mutational ratchet mechanism tends to favor mutated DNA's in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 3 to 1 ratio, but this is not a selective advantage.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't know what underlies your arrival at this ratio, but one can get
<br>
any ratio one likes with suitable assumptions about rates of mutation
<br>
and turnover.
<br>
<p>### I meant that in the absence of a selective pressure, any sequence tends
<br>
to randomize, and for every non-mutated nucleotide there are three ways of
<br>
mutating it, so you end up with a 3:1 ratio of mutated sequences for each
<br>
base that undergoes mutations.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The most general argument in favour of selection, though,
<br>
is that we know roughly the mitochondrial half-life (a week to a month
<br>
in rats) and thus we know how many mitochondrial generations it takes
<br>
for cells to be taken over -- and it's very, very few, probably only
<br>
a few times the theoretical minimum of log(2) of the number of mtDNAs
<br>
in the cell. Drift won't do that, whatever the assumptions.
<br>
<p>### If the effective number of mtDNA genomes undergoing replication is
<br>
smaller than the total number of mitos, then drift can occur pretty fast.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Actually, once you have mitofection, there are at least two feasible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods to select the mutated mtDNA's out of the cell. Previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts failed because of lack of the ability to introduce DNA into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitos, but this has now changed.
</em><br>
<p><p>Your turn to lose me. What are you suggesting, in detail?
<br>
<p>### Well, one is an idea that is undergoing preliminary testing now, the
<br>
other is an idea that evolved in our lab had recently, but was not tested,
<br>
so I am talking about highly speculative issues. I really can't discuss the
<br>
details.
