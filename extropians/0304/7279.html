<p>By Bruce Sterling
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;India and China are comers with a lot to prove to the world, and especially 
<br>
to each other. Their rivalry has roots. In a 1962 shooting war, China grabbed 
<br>
some real estate in the Kashmir region and sent India's army reeling. India 
<br>
never forgot the affront, and the dispute still smolders today.
<br>
<p>Since India demonstrated its bomb in 1998, the Chinese have been increasingly 
<br>
uneasy. China reacted to the detonation with angry demands that the 
<br>
international community keep India contained. When that got nowhere, China 
<br>
helped Pakistan go nuclear. In retrospect, that was a scary, destabilizing 
<br>
misstep. But now India and China are poised to continue their rivalry on 
<br>
safer high ground - beyond Earth's atmosphere.
<br>
<p>Nuclear India versus nuclear China is Kennedy versus Kruschev, and Reagan 
<br>
versus Gorbachev, all over again. Now, as then, a space race is a sexy 
<br>
alternative to nuclear annihilation.
<br>
<p>China has openly declared its desire to colonize the moon. The world's most 
<br>
populous nation is unlikely to build lunar settlements, but that's not the 
<br>
point. China's motive lies not in constructing a lunar Hong Kong, but rather 
<br>
in luring India into a loud public competition. Later this year, if all goes 
<br>
as planned, China will become the third country to send a citizen into space. 
<br>
An orbiting taikonaut will be even more impressive if American shuttles are 
<br>
stuck in their hangars while the misnamed International Space Station limps 
<br>
along with a skeleton crew.
<br>
<p>As Russia once did, China has a strong technical advantage. It already owns a 
<br>
chunk of the commercial space-launch business. But India has a decent shot at 
<br>
victory as well. It doesn't have China's manufacturing know-how, but it's 
<br>
rapidly becoming the world's software back office.&gt;&gt;
