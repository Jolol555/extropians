</em><br>
<p>Amara, that may well be true.  Given the list volume I'm lucky
<br>
to read 1/10th of what is said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) There are meters of blood underneath the feet of those

</em><br>
<em>&gt; They believe that humans can solve their disputes in other ways.
</em><br>
<p>I understand.  And they certainly seem willing to get involved
<br>
when things are in their own backyard, e.g. Bosnia.
<br>
<p>But when it comes to a far off place like Iraq or Kashmir
<br>
I don't see any evidence that they have cared about the
<br>
loss of human life (and therefore coming up with ways to
<br>
solve the problems) in decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Answering blood to blood is considered barbaric (I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referring to revenge, not to self-defense).
</em><br>
<p>I really do not think there is much of an element of revenge
<br>
in the U.S./U.K. actions in Iraq.  I think it is a combination
<br>
of fear of WMD falling into the hands of terrorists and a
<br>
moral position that Saddam's regime is immoral and has to go.
<br>
<p>Now, *if* the French or the Germans or the Russians, *really*
<br>
believed in minimizing bloodshed we would have seen them
<br>
pressing for the removal of Saddam through some peaceful
<br>
means over the last decade.  That didn't happen.  In fact
<br>
they were all willing to go along with him in ways that
<br>
allowed him to remain in power and allowed his regime to
<br>
commit more atrocities.
<br>
<p>What is amazing to me is that the Russian's don't realize
<br>
that Saddam is patterned after Stalin and that if you
<br>
don't do everything you can to disempower him you will
<br>
sooner or later have Gulag's destroying huge numbers
<br>
of humans (one could argue this has already been the case
<br>
with chemical weapons attacks).
