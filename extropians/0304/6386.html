<br>
because it is time flexible and so pupil centered that it is easy to let each 
<br>
child study their own interests at their own pace. Under such a scheme, 
<br>
trying to impose a curriculum structure for decades in advance might seem to 
<br>
be a bit of a conflict.
<br>
<p>Mike,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lurk on a list for those interested in educating children with IQs 
<br>
in the top 5%.  I imagine that describes a lot of people on this list as well 
<br>
as their children.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lists I have seen have a fairly high percentage of people that 
<br>
home school.  Whether they home school or not one of things they discuss is 
<br>
that high IQ children (and people?) are developmentally asymmetrical.  They 
<br>
take spurts in particular areas and are simultaneously delayed in other 
<br>
areas.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently one of their recommendations is to take advantage of the 
<br>
kids natural tendency -- To paraphrase Mark Twain, when it is time to steam 
<br>
boat help the kid steamboat, when it is time that the kid is turned on to 
<br>
learning all the dinosaurs help them learn the dinosaurs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems counter to my natural tendencies in teaching but the 
<br>
parents report great success.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest you do a google on educating high IQ children, there are 
<br>
some great sites to be found.
<br>
