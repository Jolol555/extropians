</em><br>
<p>I partially agree.  The idea that veggie proteins are built up from scratch
<br>
more than animal proteins probably doesn't pan out.  However, the idea that
<br>
vegetarians create more aminos out of other aminos (because they are not all
<br>
provided in the diet) still seems valid to me.  I still think vegetarians
<br>
create more aminos while carnivores absorb more aminos.
<br>
<p>However, after more thought, I am not sure if this helps avoid protein
<br>
damage or promote protein recycling. Protein damage may occur after the
<br>
protein is built.  Or, it may occur in the essential aminos that must come
<br>
from pre-existing sources and not as much in newly created aminos.  Or it
<br>
may be mostly caused by protein-folding defects that have little to do with
<br>
how the amino chains are constructed.  We just don't know enough about this
<br>
type of protein damage, or how protein restriction helps.
<br>
<p>In general, I do like creating more of my own aminos and utilizing less of
<br>
pre-existing aminos.
