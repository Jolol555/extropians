<p><em>&gt; do it, but they were blamed anyway.  (It did happen while they were in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charge, soon after the conquest of Alexandria.)  Now Bagdad's library 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't as significant, but it wasn't minor.  Especially if Arabic is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; native tongue.  Whatever our reputation was, it's now worse.

<p>Some people care about what others think more than others do.
<br>
There are many occasions when one has to worry about what one
<br>
will think of himself, rather than be concerned about what
<br>
others will think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That we didn't do it [assign soldiers to guard the museum]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't going to cut much ice.  We were in charge, and didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do anything to stop it or put out the fire, or even collect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scraps of parchment that flutter out on the flames.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;We were in charge&quot;?  Actually, that's what was being contested.
<br>
<p>The deeper issue, alas, as always, is the predictability of
<br>
your making a statement like that.  Have any thoughts on this
<br>
more fundamental issue of why in general you and others are
<br>
on one side and so many other people are clearly on the other?
<br>
What truly distinguishes you from them?
