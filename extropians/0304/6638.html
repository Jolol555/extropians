<p>
Surprisingly favorable discussions on slashdot.  Often those guys get
<br>
pretty reactionary.
<br>
<p>I liked Chrstine Peterson's abstract at
<br>
<a href="http://www.bu.edu/pardee/events/conferences/ABSTRACTS.htm">http://www.bu.edu/pardee/events/conferences/ABSTRACTS.htm</a>, especially
<br>
her opening paragraph:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is possible to make potentially useful projections regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological developments in the 50-to-250 year timeframe, but strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discipline is needed to avoid our natural tendency to focus on nearer-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues.  Organizers of the Conference on the Future of Human Nature are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hereby encouraged to continually redirect the group into discussing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desired timeframe.  This will be difficult given the senior level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many participants-not to mention their independent natures-but it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be necessary in order to make any progress on the challenge before us.
</em><br>
<p>See that line about how the &quot;senior level&quot; of many participants would
<br>
keep them from looking out as far as 50 years?  Ha!  I love it when
<br>
people tell it like it is.  Scientists are so afraid to be speculative.
<br>
<p>She concludes with an intriguing proposal:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the seeming inevitability of a wide variety of entities in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50-to-250 year timeframe-including traditional humans, augmented humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and machine-based intelligences-an obvious goal is to work for peaceful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coexistence.  This would include ensuring that the use of augmentation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies is voluntary, and that the physical security and assets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans are protected against coercion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A subgoal would be that traditional human families and communities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to be able to live as they choose, without either physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force or confiscatory taxation levels making it impossible for them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live by their traditions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can this be accomplished in a world with entities that are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually (and, presumably, economically) powerful than traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans? Our species already has some experience in handling such entities:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our governments.  The best answer found to date seems to be the use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of checks and balances.  Additional insight can be obtained from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field of strategy known as game theory.  Preliminary theoretical work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been done on this issue by nanotechnology theorist K. Eric Drexler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is now being written up for publication.
</em><br>
<p>It will be interesting to see what Eric Drexler comes up with as far
<br>
as ways to constrain or control the power of future SIs.  Sounds like
<br>
he is working on some design guidelines, perhaps based on separating
<br>
functionality into different units which would then limit each other.
<br>
If we make an SI we can't control it; but if we make 3 SIs, maybe each 2
<br>
of them can control the 3rd.  Could be a provocative and novel approach,
<br>
well worth exploring.
<br>
