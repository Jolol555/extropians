<em>&gt; If you aren't already doing so, I suggest you drop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your vegetarian-like diet and start eating other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy paleolithic foods! &lt;trying to the keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion on-topic&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As good as your arguments are, I'm still not convinced.  Fish is the only
<br>
thing that I think is healthy that is missing from my diet, and I replace
<br>
these with vegetarian fatty acids and supplements.
<br>
<p>However, I still have a few problems with the Paleo diet theory.
<br>
<p>1.  Why are beans left out?  I don't buy the part about not being able to
<br>
soak them.  Why do we suppose our ancestors had simple tools for hunting
<br>
(spears, sticks, knives, axes, pits, etc.), but couldn't come up with bowls,
<br>
for example.  I also don't buy the part about not being able to eat beans or
<br>
legumes raw.  I love munching on raw peas out of the garden, and the
<br>
Japanese have a long history of eating soybeans cold and raw out of the pod.
<br>
These things are easy to eat and digest.
<br>
<p>2.  Why are grains left out?  Same thing.  Everyone seems to admit that
<br>
grains grew wild all over the place.  The argument is again that ancient
<br>
tools couldn't handle them.  We have ancient examples of stone bowls and
<br>
grinding instruments.  Thrashing wheat stocks on the ground to shake out the
<br>
grain is not unusual.  I myself ate wheat out of the field on the farm when
<br>
I grew up.  Just rolling the wheat heads in your hands makes the grain fall
<br>
out.  And other grains, such as corn, are really easy to get to.  I see no
<br>
difficulty eating this stuff with my bare hands.
<br>
<p>3.  Speaking of not having bowls, this Paleo Diet seems to assume that
<br>
everything needs to be cooked using an open flame.  Modern knowledge tells
<br>
us that this is the worst way to cook foods, especially meats.  Charred food
<br>
or even fire-cooked foods are more carcinogenic.  While this may not have
<br>
bothered our ancestors who died at an early age, it certainly bothers me
<br>
when I want to live well past 100.
<br>
<p>4.  I agree that humans are naturally omnivores, eating meat and vegetables.
<br>
But the meat-eating seems a bit exaggerated.  It is not obvious or proven
<br>
that the ancient ancestors ate huge amounts of meat every day.  They
<br>
probably had meat a few times per week, and foraged for nuts, berries, and
<br>
vegetables the rest of the time.  Their diet was mostly vegetarian every
<br>
day, with boosts of meat occasionally.  I don't see why this theory is so
<br>
down on vegetarianism, when it clearly supported humans most days.
<br>
<p>5.  Speaking of vegetarianism, most of the complaints against vegetarianism
<br>
have nothing to do with modern day.  First of all, if someone isn't a total
<br>
vegan, meaning they also eat milk, dairy and eggs, then they are not missing
<br>
out on all the animal-only nutrients.  Plus, we have supplements today.  Any
<br>
modern person taking a well rounded supplement won't have any of the
<br>
deficiency problems.  Plus, we can mass produce food in ways never available
<br>
before.  Maybe the ancients couldn't mass produce tofu enough for their
<br>
diet, but the corner grocery store can.  Most of the anti-vegetarianism
<br>
stuff I read here is aimed at theoretical diets that don't exist any more,
<br>
or aimed at pseudo-scientific claims that have nothing to do with a
<br>
life-extensionist diet that avoids meat.
<br>
<p>6.  I agree totally with the part about ancient lean meats being much
<br>
healthier than the fatty meats we produce today.  That is part of the reason
<br>
I am vegetarian, and part of the reason I don't eat a lot of meat to
<br>
duplicate the Paleo diet.  Modern meat is dangerous, fatty stuff.  It bears
<br>
little resemblance to lean, low-fat, low-cholesterol meat available in
<br>
ancient times.  It seems that a Paleo diet would avoid modern meat, and
<br>
maybe only eat fish, and lean fowl, but hardly ever touch the modern stuff
<br>
they sell as meat.
<br>
<p>7.  As for the idea that we are &quot;adapted&quot; to the Paleo diet, I think there
<br>
is a lot of confusion as to what &quot;adaptation&quot; is.  It rarely involves
<br>
mutations or genetic changes of thousands of years as most people think.
<br>
Adaptation occurs in one or two generations when all those not adapted to
<br>
survive die off, and only the survivors have offspring into the next
<br>
generation.  We have had dairy, tofu, grains, bread, and agriculture for
<br>
thousands of years.  Anybody not well adapted to these diets died of
<br>
millennia ago.  I am not sure why anybody would think that a modern person
<br>
today would be well adapted to a diet that disappeared so long ago.  Only
<br>
people who could adapt, live, and even thrive on agriculture have survived
<br>
for the last few thousand years.  The theory of adaptation and fitness
<br>
toward the modern diet seems to indicate that we should aim not at the Paleo
<br>
diet, but at more of an agricultural based diet more than 200 years ago, but
<br>
within the last few thousand years.
<br>
<p>8. Even if the Paleo Diet were the perfect diet we are adapted towards,
<br>
there is a big question as to what that adaptation is set to maximize.
<br>
Evolutionary pressures do not push for longevity of individuals.  It pushes
<br>
for maximum offspring.  Look at nature, which often produces millions of
<br>
little tadpoles just so a few survive.  This natural systems is not very
<br>
good for individual survival or longevity.  I see no reason for the
<br>
assumption that this natural diet is the best for life-extension.  At best,
<br>
I could consider it to be best for early reproduction.  The longevity of the
<br>
parents after reproductions, or after the kids grew up, would have little to
<br>
do with genetics or evolution.  It may even be evolutionarily more sound to
<br>
have the parents die off young so they stop competing with the next
<br>
generation.  I don't trust evolution to make good choices for individual
<br>
longevity.  This is the biggest flaw I see in the whole theory.  The
<br>
underlying premise seems unlikely to me.
<br>
<p>The Paleo Diet sounds good in theory, but there is a lot of interpretation
<br>
and selective application going on.
