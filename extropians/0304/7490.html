<em>&gt; I do not avoid meats, nor do I recommend that others do so. I am
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; selective about them because of the way modern farmers raise their cattle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I do sometimes order natural wild game or range-fed meats.
</em><br>
<p>I said &quot;some&quot; meats, not all meat.  Being selective means you avoid some and
<br>
choose others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You on the other hand argue that you don't like farm-fed meats but you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not seem to be opposed to the notion of eating natural meats. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are you? If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are open to eating natural meats then I would say you are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian in any ideological sense.
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  When I turned vegetarian, I knew of know source of healthy
<br>
meat.  I chose to be vegetarian for longevity purposes.  With modern
<br>
technology and &quot;natural&quot; sources of lean meat, it may be possible to get
<br>
meat that is healthy enough.  However, it still may contain some saturated
<br>
fat and cholesterol.  I prefer to avoid all of it.  I do not miss meat at
<br>
all, and see no reason to risk even a little saturated fat or go through any
<br>
hassle to get it.  However, I would be the first one to admit that I cannot
<br>
claim that it is impossible to eat meat as part of a healthy diet.  I just
<br>
believe it is easier to eat a vegetarian healthy diet, so that is what I
<br>
choose.  The typical food offerings today are so bad, that I don't think
<br>
anybody can have good health without careful nutritional planning.  Using
<br>
supplements, eating a special diet, or ordering specialized foods that are
<br>
outside the mainstream, some sort of thought and planning is required to
<br>
avoid common nutritional pitfalls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for tofu, it does not contain many of the substances found in meats
</em><br>
&nbsp;and
<br>
<em>&gt; it contains many other substances not found in meats. We evolved on meats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not soy, and I don't try to second-guess nature. I also have reservations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about soy in terms of nutrition science. It contains, among other things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phytates which disturb the digestion process by binding to minerals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Phytates are not removed during the process of making tofu (though some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other forms of processed soy do not contain them). Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phytates are &quot;anti-nutrients,&quot; while others disagree. I know only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this much:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we did not evolve on a diet rich in phytates as found in non-paleolithic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foods like soy.
</em><br>
<p>This is such a non-issue to me, that I don't care.  I use supplements to get
<br>
optimal amounts of life-extending minerals, such as selenium.  These levels
<br>
are so far beyond what is found in meat or tofu or vegetables, that arguing
<br>
over these small amounts has no effect on my dietary input.  If you insist
<br>
on being &quot;natural&quot; without &quot;technological intervention&quot;, then these issues
<br>
might come up.  But for a life-extensionist on a good supplement program,
<br>
deficiencies are not an issue.  This fits my transhumanist lifestyle better,
<br>
in my opinion.
<br>
<p>The fact that phytates might reduce mineral absorption by a few percent is
<br>
minor compared to the fact that saturated fats and cholesterol definitely
<br>
have life-threatening qualities.  I don't see how anybody can argue that
<br>
scientific evidence shows meat to be safer than tofu, except as a matter of
<br>
faith that evolution got it right and current science must be wrong.
