<em>&gt;&gt; ### Do you think that protein aggregation is causative in sporadic AD
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or PD, or that it is involved in the pathomechanism at some later
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stage, perhaps amplifying the damage caused by other factors?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Recently it turned out that APP has a direct toxic effect on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mitochondria, and mutant alpha-synuclein has also been implicated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; diminished mito function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's still very unclear what the major pathogenic process is in AD or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PD, but the various aggregates seem to be the only options, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing else has been identified that changes in affected cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (either with age or faster in the disease than in normal aging).
</em><br>
<p>### What about mtDNA mutations? They are accumulating to a very significant
<br>
degree, see recent work by Simon and Flint Beal
<br>
-----------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The
<br>
<em>&gt; effect on mitochondria is interesting, but basically I think that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be sure that these aggregates are bad for us, so let's get rid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, rather than wasting time worrying about precisely how they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad for us.
</em><br>
<p>### If there is a different underlying process, dealing with the aggregates
<br>
will not remove all of the problem, although it could ameliorate some of it.
<br>
I would rather try to attack the ultimate cause, which most likely doesn't
<br>
involve the proteins that actually aggregate (except in Huntington's, DRPLA,
<br>
and other classic triplet expansion diseases).
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Also, are protein aggregates in AD and PD really lysosomal, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cytoplasmic (or even extracellular)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In AD, the Abeta aggregates (plaques) are extracellular but can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made lysosomal by vaccination (Elan's work, etc).  Vaccination makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microglia engulf (endocytose) bits of plaque.  It thereby becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lysosomal.
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, but in the absence of Elan, amyloid is extralysosomal, so it
<br>
couldn't act by choking the lysosomes, and putting xenoenzymes in this
<br>
compartment will not allow amyloid removal.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As for tau (tangles) in AD and alpha-synuclein in PD, the
<br>
<em>&gt; evidence that it is lysosomal is limited but positive: see eg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neurosci Lett 284:187 or Mol Cell Neurosci 18:702.  It would be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising if it weren't, because the stuff is clearly accumulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the detriment of the cell.  In some neurodegenerative diseases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there seem to be nuclear aggregates, but that is very much the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exception.
</em><br>
<p>### Is there some alpha-synuclein in lysosomes simply because stuff ends up
<br>
in lysosomes, or is it's presence in the lysosomes the mechanism of its
<br>
detrimental action? This has not been answered so far, AFAIK.
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Atheromas are not aggregates of lysosomally indigestible material, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; improving cellular digestion is not likely to be of help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong.  First, plaques develop from foam cells, which are macrophages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have endocytosed modified LDL in the artery wall and failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digest it all, which is why they became foam cells.  Second, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mature plaque there is a constant influx of new macrophages that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enter it for the purpose of breaking down the core, and they engulf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits of it, but they can't break it down so they die and become part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the problem.
</em><br>
<p>### Atheromatous material may be difficult to digest, but is not
<br>
non-digestible. With some treatments you can have regression of
<br>
atherosclerotic changes implying digestion of macroscopic amounts of plaque.
<br>
There is a dynamic balance between plaque accumulation and digestion.
<br>
Macrophages can eat incredibly tough stuff, even bacterial cell membranes.
<br>
