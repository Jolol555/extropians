<em>&gt; [T]he point is that there's no reason to expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology of free computers and software to progress any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowly than mass-market &quot;trustworthy&quot; ones.  The only way the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter will sell is if there's some &quot;killer app&quot; that absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires Palladium; I don't see such an app anytime soon, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's already too late.
</em><br>
<p>How about being able to legally download music and video content?
<br>
Couldn't that be a killer app for this technology?
<br>
<p>(quoting Hal):
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No one is forcing you to run such an app, and no one is forcing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; content companies to download the data to you.  The trusted computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology makes possible a new kind of transaction which cannot occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; today.  Consumers may choose to adopt this technology in order to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; part in these kinds of transactions.  There is no need for coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or a legal mandate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That all true, I agree--but you could have said the same thing for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dozen other copy-protection techbologies that have been tried over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the years.  And all of them failed miserably.  That's all I'm saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here: comsumers aren't stupid, and they know what copy-protection is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they know not to buy into it, no matter what the sweet-sounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words of the creators are.  All the double-speak of &quot;enabling&quot; new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of restricted transactions is easy to see through.
</em><br>
<p>It's true that the copy-protection technologies have generally failed.
<br>
Software &quot;dongles&quot; and floppy-disk-based copy protection schemes were
<br>
widely hated by customers and vendors eventually largely abandoned them.
<br>
Consumer systems like the DivX DVD system, which would only play your
<br>
DVDs for 24 hours, or the Sony minidisk recorders which enforce many
<br>
restrictions, have also not succeeded.  It's entirely possible that
<br>
trusted computing could fail in the same way.  On the other hand, TC
<br>
technology is being backed by Microsoft, a company with considerable
<br>
market clout, which could make a big difference in its success.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; By &quot;revolt&quot; I mean simply to refuse to patronize it, and to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create free alternatives.  And the reason is simple: restricting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the free exchange and use of information is inherently evil, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how it is justified.
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that a system which allows people to voluntarily agree to
<br>
bind themselves to restrictions on the exchange of information is evil?
<br>
Like, using Palladium to prove that I am running Windows Media Player,
<br>
as a condition for downloading some music?  Which of us is being evil:
<br>
the server who will only download data to people who are running WMP;
<br>
the person who runs WMP and downloads data, accepting limitations on
<br>
its use; the person who designed and sold this technology?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'm not suggesting--nor is any libertarian I know--that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should forbid it, or that people shouldn't have the freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrict themselves.  All we're saying is that we haven't heard a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument yet why someone would want to do that other than &quot;we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producers of content to have more control and consumers less&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>How about &quot;we want both producers and consumers of content to have the
<br>
maximum flexibility and options for how they negotiate their mutually
<br>
acceptable exchanges&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If I am to willingly sign away my rights to something, I expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something big in return.  I might sign an NDA with an employer, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, trading some of my right to free speech for the compensation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a job.  If I choose to run a &quot;trustworthy&quot; app on a Palladium-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enabled computer, what am I getting for giving away my rights?  Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it worth the price?
</em><br>
<p>Of course these are exactly the questions which you or anyone else
<br>
should be asking in an exchange like this.  I wish that you and other
<br>
libertarians would support a technology which gives people more ways to
<br>
answer it.
