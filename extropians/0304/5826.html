subsidies is likely to be a more effective way of providing help.
<br>
<p>Rafal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better way to go would be to encourage manufacturing to locate 
<br>
operations within the US.  In 1951I was a High School drop out and I took a 
<br>
job in a neighborhood machine shop.  By the time I was 18 (18 months later) I 
<br>
was making enough to support a stay at home wife had that been on my agenda.  
<br>
By my 18th birthday I was looking for a better job for two reasons:
<br>
1.  The jobs were readily available.
<br>
2.  As I had turned 18 I was an extremely eligible candidate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I don't believe we had a minimum wage -- if so my wages 
<br>
were high enough they weren't a factor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning sometime in the 60s our country has passed one law after 
<br>
another making making manufacturing operations within the US less and less 
<br>
attractive.  I say reverse that trend and forget the minimum wage and 
<br>
unemployment insurance.  Those two will no longer be a factor.
<br>
