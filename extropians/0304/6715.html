<em>&gt;&gt; It's extremely likely that hominids have been eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fermented fruits for millions of years. Also organisms in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gut are producing alcohol constantly.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you provide references for the two statements above?  I haven't heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either of them before and would like to learn more.
</em><br>
<p>My first statement comes from the basic observation that humans have always
<br>
scavenged for food, which would easily include scavenging the fermenting
<br>
fruits that lay on the ground. Other animals also eat those fermenting
<br>
fruits, and it's fairly certain that we learned what to eat largely by
<br>
watching other animals. (This reminds me... birds in the yard of the home in
<br>
which I was raised ate the fermenting berries from the surrounding bushes.
<br>
We suffered broken windows from birds flying under the influence.)
<br>
<p>Concerning my second statement, I don't recall where I learned about alcohol
<br>
production by gut microbes. Some microbes help oxidize alcohol, while others
<br>
actually produce it. I'll need to do some research to find references. I do
<br>
recall actually seeing a scientific estimate of the number of ml's of
<br>
ethanol produced each day in the healthy human gut.
<br>
<p>A quick search of Medline turns up two relevant abstracts, which I have
<br>
included at the bottom of this post. 
<br>
<p>In the first abstract you'll find the statement, concerning aerobic bacteria
<br>
in the human colon, &quot;Kinetic characteristics of the bacterial enzymes may
<br>
enable some of them to produce acetaldehyde even from endogenous ethanol
<br>
formed by other bacteria via alcoholic fermentation.&quot; In the second abstract
<br>
you'll find the statement &quot;The effect of temperature on microbial
<br>
fermentation in blood was studied. Specimens of human blood from a blood
<br>
bank were inoculated with Candida albicans, an organism capable of causing
<br>
fermentation.&quot; Candida albicans is found also in the gut.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very interesting theory on prehistoric alcohol use though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The consensus among anthropologists is that every human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture yet studied has used chemical or ritual means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentionally explore mental states (e.g., &quot;get high&quot;), so if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was some easy way for our hunter-gatherer ancestors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extract alcohol from the environment, it wouldn't be too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising for them to find and make use of it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. I don't suppose our early ancestors started out intentionally to get
<br>
high, but it very likely happened as an occasional consequence of eating too
<br>
much fermenting fruit picked up off the forest floor. Some clever late paleo
<br>
or early neo guy then made the connection between fermented fruit and
<br>
pleasurable feelings, and on that day wine was born into the world. A little
<br>
later some neolithic guy noticed the same can be done with grains, and on
<br>
that day beer was born. Distilled spirits did not however come until much,
<br>
much later. 
<br>
<p>From a paleodiet perspective, a glass of wine with dinner is perfectly
<br>
acceptable and probably even beneficial, but shots of whisky are completely
<br>
out of the question.

Characteristics of alcohol dehydrogenases of certain aerobic bacteria

representing human colonic flora.

<br>
We have recently proposed the existence of a bacteriocolonic pathway for
<br>
ethanol oxidation [i.e., ethanol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenases
<br>
(ADHs) of intestinal bacteria resulting in high intracolonic levels of
<br>
reactive and toxic acetaldehyde]. The aim of this in vitro study was to
<br>
characterize further ADH activity of some aerobic bacteria, representing the
<br>
normal human colonic flora. These bacteria were earlier shown to possess
<br>
high cytosolic ADH activities (Escherichia coli IH 133369, Klebsiella
<br>
pneumoniae IH 35385, Klebsiella oxytoca IH 35339, Pseudomonas aeruginosa IH
<br>
35342, and Hafnia alvei IH 53227). ADHs of the tested bacteria strongly
<br>
preferred NAD as a cofactor. Marked ADH activities were found in all
<br>
bacteria, even at low ethanol concentrations (1.5 mM) that may occur in the
<br>
colon due to bacterial fermentation. The Km for ethanol varied from 29.9 mM
<br>
for K. pneumoniae to 0.06 mM for Hafnia alvei. The inhibition of ADH by
<br>
4-methylpyrazole was found to be of the competitive type in 4 of 5 bacteria,
<br>
and Ki varied from 18.26 +/- 3.3 mM for Escherichia coli to 0.47 +/- 0.13 mM
<br>
for K. pneumoniae. At pH 7.4, ADH activity was significantly lower than at
<br>
pH 9.6 in four bacterial strains. ADH of K. oxytoca, however, showed almost
<br>
equal activities at neutral pH and at 9.6. In conclusion, NAD-linked alcohol
<br>
dehydrogenases of aerobic colonic bacteria possess low apparent Km's for
<br>
ethanol. Accordingly, they may oxidize moderate amounts of ethanol ingested
<br>
during social drinking with nearly maximal velocity. This may result in the
<br>
marked production of intracolonic acetaldehyde. Kinetic characteristics of
<br>
the bacterial enzymes may enable some of them to produce acetaldehyde even
<br>
from endogenous ethanol formed by other bacteria via alcoholic fermentation.
<br>
The microbial ADHs were inhibited by 4-methylpyrazole by the same
<br>
competitive inhibition as hepatic ADH, however, with nearly 1000 times lower
<br>
susceptibility. Individual variations in human colonic flora may thus
<br>
contribute to the risk of alcohol-related gastrointestinal morbidity, such
<br>
as diarrhea, colon polyps and cancer, and liver injury.

The effect of temperature on microbial fermentation in blood was studied.
<br>
Specimens of human blood from a blood bank were inoculated with Candida
<br>
albicans, an organism capable of causing fermentation. A preservative was
<br>
added to a portion of the inoculated specimens. These inoculated specimens,
<br>
as well as uninoculated blood, were stored under various temperature
<br>
conditions. Production of ethyl alcohol was monitored over a period of six
<br>
months. Fermentation was found to be highly temperature dependent, with
<br>
refrigeration proving to be most effective at inhibiting ethanol formation. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For that reason, I'd be cautious about over-interpreting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence of these enzymes as evidence for co-evolution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans and alcohol consumption.  That might be why the enzyme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is there, or there might be some other reason(s).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very interesting theory on prehistoric alcohol use though.
