</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; ingrained disdain based on what some might consider half truths and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; misconceptions is unacceptable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which Samantha responded to me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If our current actions are about nothing of the kind except in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rhetoric then such an exposition is irrelevant to judging said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Here I would challenge your assertion that our current actions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have nothing to do with liberation beyond rhetoric. Iraq is currently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruled by a brutal, despotic regime (a point I hope all of us on this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list might agree).
</em><br>
<p>That we agree on this does not mean that liberation of the Iraqi 
<br>
people is the primary motivation for our action or even a very 
<br>
significant one.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though our actions are being taken primarily out of
<br>
<em>&gt; our own self-interest, the Iraqi people will benefit from the removal of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that barbaric thug Hussein. As I have said many times, it would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolish for anyone to suggest that just because our actions are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on altruism, that the end results which follow them would then be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devoid of merit. Unless of course you believe that the removal of Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein and his regime would not somehow positively impact the lives of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi people. If that is indeed the case, then I would respectfully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask that you elaborate on why you feel that removing that butcher would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not directly benefit in the long term that beleagured people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>At this point I see no way of being sure that the proposed 23 
<br>
ministries headed by Americans with Iraqis as only advisors will 
<br>
appear to the Iraqi people or to the world as a net gain any 
<br>
time soon.  There is likely to be a lot of strife and violence 
<br>
in imposing and maintaining this occupation.  Iraqis sometimes 
<br>
say that any other than a very strong and domineering leader 
<br>
would not work in Iraq.  I hope they are wrong.
<br>
<p>A large part of the beleaguring of the people is, or is 
<br>
perceived as, the doings of ourselves and the British 
<br>
especially, and the UN more generally.  There is some level of 
<br>
veracity to this view.  The people would be most un-beleagured 
<br>
by getting the control of their country back without sanctions 
<br>
and continuous bombardment and interference.  I don't know at 
<br>
this point how far we are from that.  Noone does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;   That some people have absolutely nothing positive to say of the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; States is deplorable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Sure.  But this is not the point right now.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not by itself, no, it is not. But when one's argument is based in large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part, as some have done, on unending criticism of the United States, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the record of the US needs to be fully analyzed and understood in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical perspective to refute such an argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The wrongs of the US that are directly pertinent to the current 
<br>
situation are still directly pertinent no matter how many rights 
<br>
the US has also accomplished.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet some insist that merely because the
<br>
<em>&gt; US (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; any other country) is powerful and in a dominant world position, than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; bad,  or &quot;might makes wrong&quot;, in huMania's words. This position too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; acceptable in any form to many on this list, and the record of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; States as compared to other major world powers, most notably the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviet Union
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; or Nazi Germany, is a necessary part of illustrating why the position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;might makes wrong&quot; is not appropriate in all cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You are over-simplifying the real objection.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would respectfully disagree. Perhaps this is not an apt description of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your point of view, nor was I referring to you specifically in that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph, but I have had debates on this forum where people opposed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this action have acknowledged they would like to see the United States 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;humbled&quot; due to their preeminent position in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would like to see the US &quot;humbled&quot; from the unabashed 
<br>
arrogance of presuming the right to attack any country at any 
<br>
time, even preemptively, if they feel at all threatened.  I 
<br>
don't say *we* here because this is no part of this American's 
<br>
understanding of what this country is supposed to be about.  I 
<br>
would like us &quot;humbled&quot; from the notion that we should and must 
<br>
insure that no other country or group of countries ever becomes 
<br>
as economically, politically and/or militarily as strong as we. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also is in my mind an exceedingly un-American way of 
<br>
conducting international affairs.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;Which is the public text, speech and actions that we intend to use our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right or wrong, to remold the world to our liking whether or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is what is best for or desired by the people of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries to be molded.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This, I would respectfully argue, is an oversimplification on your part. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United States is not &quot;remolding the world&quot; in our image, or &quot;to our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liking&quot; or we would be installing democracies in countries currently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruled by totalitarian thugs that have not sought weapons of mass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction like Laos, Vietnam, and sadly more African nations then I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would care to mention. 
</em><br>
<p>Give us time.  There are two ways of domination.  One is by 
<br>
rearranging governments wholesale to our liking or control.  The 
<br>
other is by undercutting governments so that they cannot gainsay 
<br>
us too effectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The United States is acting in its defensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interests against a regime that has actively sought weapons of mass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction, in the recent past invaded its neighbor, and shown a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decidedly anti-U.S. fervor. 
</em><br>
<p>Hell, if I was in a country that had endured what Iraq had 
<br>
endured I would have anti-US fervor.  I don't see how we can get 
<br>
anywhere at all without admitting that a lot of Mid-East nations 
<br>
have considerable reason to distrust and even hate us. Without 
<br>
seeing that we are acting from fantasy land.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If Saddam Hussein truly possessed no threat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to anyone, then why would a body with as many divergent interests such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the UN have supported any resolutions on disarmament, let alone see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the need to ferry weapons inspectors in and out of the country for more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a decade?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Because it was part of Iraqi War 1 agreements that he disarm and 
<br>
because the case was imho over-inflated of the danger he 
<br>
represented.  Any attempt to reevaluate the situation over the 
<br>
years was vetoed principally by us. We largely control the 
<br>
Security Council.  As much disagreement as recently was the case 
<br>
is the exception.  Why is there so much disagreement with this 
<br>
invasion if it is crystal clear it is the right thing to do and 
<br>
that Saddam is still, after 12 years of sanctions, a huge 
<br>
military defeat, years of inspections, continuous patrolling and 
<br>
bombardment of the no-fly zones unilaterally imposed by us and 
<br>
the British, a great and present threat?  Why on earth would any 
<br>
sane person believe he is much of a threat after all that?  I 
<br>
really don't understand it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;There is nothing democratic or free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about changing people's home country to what you might prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of their own wishes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And there is nothing democratic, free, or humane in being satisfied with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing a butcher such as Hussein to run roughshod over Iraq for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseeable future, which is what the UN, even with its half-hearted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk of disarmament, seemed quite content in allowing.
</em><br>
<p>It is not our job or the UN's job to insure every country has 
<br>
what we or the majority might consider a reasonable leader.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising, given their failure to act while genocide occured in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cambodia, Rwanda and scores of other locales.
</em><br>
<p>And their failure to act on our illegal actions in Nicaragua or 
<br>
to act to stop Israeli actions against Palestine or even to send 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inspectors to see for themselves the extent of the latter 
<br>
problem.  I certainly won't argue the UN is very effective. 
<br>
However, that it isn't does not mean we can and should do 
<br>
whatever we wish or that what we are doing in this case is 
<br>
justified.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think it can be argued 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite successfully that the Iraqi people are not interested in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy, they have no political traditions which would give them any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to be. However, I'm sure like most humans they're interested in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better quality of life for themselves and their families. You may not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that the US bringing about regime change will bring that. Fair 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough. But you cannot seriously argue that the despotism, torture, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary murder will somehow disappear under Hussein or his sons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think we could support internal movements for change 
<br>
and not come in until/unless asked by significant 
<br>
representatives of the Iraqi people and only then if it was also 
<br>
in our interest.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;This is absolutely false.  Retract it immediately.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will not retract it at this point, however I will add that I should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have said that &quot;It appears to some of us on this list that Samantha's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions are predicated on a belief that the US has consistently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supported dictators at the expense of democracy abroad.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>As a matter of fact we have too many times supported dictators 
<br>
at the expense of democracy abroad.  As a matter of fact we have 
<br>
toppled democratically elected governments using every form of 
<br>
terrorism in the book.  Not consistently but all too often.  But 
<br>
that is not what my position on this invasion of Iraq is based upon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one thread (such as one on the Shah of Iran), in discussions with me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have consistently criticized the US's support of authoritarian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimes in the past. I have countered that the US did not have a choice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between democracy and authoritarianism, it had choices between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authoritarianism and worse.
</em><br>
<p>This is not strictly true but that is another subject.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; All that being said, I am simply confused as to how it is that you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticize the United States for in the past supporting authoritarian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimes and in your view &quot;preventing democracy&quot; and yet now severely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticize them for attempting to bring (by a result of their actions) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy and freedom, or at worst the removal of a brutal tyrant, to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people of Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I criticize us for acting extra-legally around the world, 
<br>
frankly as terrorists, to change regimes to our liking.  We have 
<br>
used industrial espionage, economic sabotage, mass incitement to 
<br>
riot, assasinations and so on for these purposes.  Civilized 
<br>
people must condemn this.  I am amazed when I see what I presume 
<br>
are civilized people excuse such.
