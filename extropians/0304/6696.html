<p>Ron, I have to agree with Amara here for at least two reasons.
<br>
First, most news in English is based on a financing model designed to
<br>
sell things to English speaking people (e.g. ads) -- as such there are
<br>
many topics that don't receive much attention (because they don't
<br>
&quot;sell&quot; papers, entice viewers to &quot;watch&quot;, etc.)  Second, there are
<br>
many language &quot;features&quot; that simply cannot be expressed in English
<br>
so one can never really properly understand some topics in English.
<br>
<p>For example, there is an ethnic group in Russia, I think perhaps
<br>
Udmurtia (someone correct this if they know otherwise), where the
<br>
native language has verb tenses that properly reflect the &quot;veracity&quot;
<br>
of a statement.  E.g. -- &quot;it happened to me&quot;, &quot;it happened to my
<br>
best friend or family member&quot;, &quot;it happened to someone I consider
<br>
to be a friend&quot;, &quot;it heard it 4th hand&quot;, &quot;somebody somewhere said&quot;,
<br>
etc.  Now, in the common &quot;English&quot; press one has to judge &quot;veracity&quot;
<br>
on whether it is published in Science or Nature vs. the NY Times vs.
<br>
the National Enquirer.  That simply isn't as good as a language
<br>
that naturally reflects how good the information is.
<br>
<p>Robert
