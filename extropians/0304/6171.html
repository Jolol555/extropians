Ron h says that america reacted because there was reasonable proof that USA was threatened, There has never been reasonable proof that Iraq was a threat to the states,sometime Ron h, s   blind patriotism is beyond belief.Regards Brian Booth

<br>
one time I believe you admitted as much at least indirectly. You have 
<br>
seemed to believe the motive was WMD. We found none. So do the Iraqis 
<br>
dancing in the street say that our motives were other than what they were or 
<br>
that the war was justified? I don't think so.
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
We have had less than a month to search an area that I am told is the 
<br>
size of California and all while a war is going on. Isn't it strange that we 
<br>
can find enough evidence to come up to the standard you will demand of us.
<br>
On the other hand this is a political situation no reasonable person 
<br>
is going to demand a level of proof of us more than is required in a court of 
<br>
law -- in other words we will be held to the &quot;reasonable man&quot; level not to a 
<br>
scientific level of proof.
<br>
Now, have you notice that &quot;Chemical Ali&quot; that gassed the Iranians and 
<br>
the Kurds has repeatedly threatened us. In addition have you noticed that he 
<br>
had the protective equipment to protect his own should he decide to attack 
<br>
us.
<br>
I submit that and similar evidence is sufficient to prove to the 
<br>
&quot;reasonable man&quot; that we reacted properly.
<br>
In any case when you threaten someone they will decide when the level 
<br>
of threat rises to a level sufficient for them to protect themselves. We 
<br>
decided and we reacted. But beyond that we waited until sufficient proof was 
<br>
available to suit the reasonable man.
<br>
Ron h.
