<br>
<em>&gt; Here is a question for you:  suppose that an unknown person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living in New York City absolutely needed a serum, and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrived reasons, only you could deliver it to him in time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way that you can arrive in New York in time is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleport by a method that (sadly) must destroy the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the scan is made.  Would you teleport?
</em><br>
<p>I would not teleport to save the other person unless I was willing to give
<br>
my life for that person.  I would consider the destructive teleport to be
<br>
death to me.  Nobody else would care, since the duplicate who replaces me is
<br>
good enough to carry on in my place.  For me, this is the same as having a
<br>
pod-person grow in my back yard and then kill me and take my place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A second question is, suppose that this sort of teleportation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again for technical reasons, was the only kind of teleportation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered so far.  Would you teleport across the pacific on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business, in the light of its cheapness and convenience?
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  Again, because I consider it death to me, with another person taking
<br>
my place.  Cheapness and convenience don't convince me.  Suppose I told you
<br>
that it was much cheaper to kill you and have an actor on Mars study up and
<br>
assume your identity.  This is much cheaper than actually sending you to
<br>
Mars.  This actor is so good, that nobody else could tell the difference.
<br>
He will memorize all your history so he can answer questions and act like
<br>
you.  He is far enough away, that nobody can take DNA tests to detect the
<br>
difference.  He could pretend to take a DNA test, but then transmit your DNA
<br>
record instead.  There is a delay in radio signals to Mars, giving him
<br>
plenty of time to research answers to questions about you he doesn't know.
<br>
Thus, he will be indistinguishable from you in all detectable respect.
<br>
<p>Don't you want to go to Mars in this fashion?  It is cheaper and convenient?
<br>
There is no way to detect that he is not you after the fact.  Everybody who
<br>
undergoes this process now reports from Mars that they feel fine and there
<br>
is nothing to fear.  I don't see why everybody doesn't allow this method of
<br>
transport.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We agree, except that I'd sadly acquiesce in &quot;destruction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original&quot; scenarios, knowing that I had come &quot;that close&quot; to having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bonafide duplicate.
</em><br>
<p>I think duplicates are cool.  After one was created, I would hate to see one
<br>
destroyed.  Each is a person deserving life as much as the other.  I see no
<br>
rationale for why one should be destroyed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think we are wasting time discussing whether individual atoms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important until we actually find someone who holds this belief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I totally agree.  Let us agree not to resume discussion of whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular atoms matter until someone argues that it does.
</em><br>
<p>It's not a big deal for me to waste time.  But I think it is a problem that
<br>
does not need to be solved.  Other problems, such as how to teleport with
<br>
destroying the original, do need to be solved.  I would like to be uploaded
<br>
into a more robust body.  I will only agree to do this if an procedure
<br>
acceptable to me is invented.
