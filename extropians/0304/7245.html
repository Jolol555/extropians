</em><br>
<p>Quite right -- for most plants.  The chlamydomonads, however, appear
<br>
to have experienced just as much selective pressure against large
<br>
mitochondrial genomes as animals, and the result is a genome with only
<br>
seven of our 13 protein-coding genes (plus one that we don't have).
<br>
(Plasmodium has only three, but it's done the Complex I trick so in
<br>
fact it has moved one less than Chlamy.)  It seems that without the
<br>
code disparity evolution was able to get quite a bit further against
<br>
the hydrophobicity problem -- but still not nearly all the way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, there are many highly hydrophobic proteins made in the nucleus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and imported into membranes, or through membranes.
</em><br>
<p>Into membranes yes, through membranes no.  The anion carriers are very
<br>
hydrophobic and yet nuclear-coded, but they get into the inner membrane
<br>
by a different route that doesn't involve an N-terminal leader and is
<br>
not preceded by complete import into the matrix.  Ones that do go via
<br>
the matrix (eg cytochrome c1) are much less hydrophobic, at least by
<br>
what seems to be the appropriate measure, &quot;mesohydrophobicity&quot; (see
<br>
work by Claros in the mid-90s).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The genetic code difference makes sense to me because it implies the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for at least three independent mutational events for mtDNA-nDNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gene transfer in vertebrates. You have to make a nuclear pseudogene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a mtDNA gene, then mutate it into a form which will produce a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viable protein if read by the nuclear tRNA's, and then you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple it to a mitochondrial leader peptide. Each event happens all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time, but all three together would be quite uncommon.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that the &quot;mutate it into a form which will produce a
<br>
viable protein&quot; bit is actually not one mutational event but one for
<br>
each discrepant codon, and they all (all the UGA's and most of the rest,
<br>
anyway) have to occur in the absence of any other mutations that make
<br>
the protein not work.  This seems to me to explain why (as far as we
<br>
can tell) the code disparity is in fact vastly harder for evolution to
<br>
solve than either of the other two hurdles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### You lost me here. For the outcome of a xenohydrolase treatment it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely matters whether the lysosomal aggregates are detrimental or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, all I meant here was that if there's no non-lysosomal problem
<br>
then by elimination the lysosomal aggregates must be detrimental.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### You are talking about the so called &quot;fatty streaks&quot;, right? Fatty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; streaks can fully disappear.
</em><br>
<p>This is news to me.  Can you give references?  This certainly flies in
<br>
the face of all I've ever come across on fatty streaks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only way you can tell there is totally indigestible stuff in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plaque is if you cannot digest it in vitro in cell culture
</em><br>
<p>True.  As far as I'm aware, no one has done the simple experiment of
<br>
exposing macrophages to atheroma in culture and seeing what happens.
<br>
Or more likely, it was done 50 years ago and the result was boring...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and if injected in vivo in a young animal, it doesn't get phagocytosed.
</em><br>
<p>I think you meant &quot;OR if injected ...&quot; -- clearly both phagocytosis and
<br>
digestion have to happen, either without the other is useless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### A different explanation is that there is a dynamic balance between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the influx of digestible fatty material, and the ability of endothelium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and macrophages to deal with it. As time goes by, the balance tilts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards buildup, with first only occasional macrophages dying, then as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the quality of macrophages goes down with age (and it does), there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't enough to deal with plaque even if it's still digestible, also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of scarring, and calcification.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree that this is an explanation, because it doesn't explain why
<br>
fatty streaks appear in childhood.  Any process of accumulating damage
<br>
(e.g. junk like this) that is already easily detectable in early life
<br>
is by definition primary, not brought on by the misfortune of inhabiting
<br>
the same body as a bunch of other aging tissues (and thus experiencing
<br>
a tilting of a dynamic balance).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### It is not clear that the mutant sequences, aside perhaps from some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deletion mutants, have a selective advantage.
</em><br>
<p>You're quite right that the evidence is best for large deletions.  But
<br>
that's all we care about, because they're always (absolutely always)
<br>
homoplasmic or nearly so in COX-negative cells (muscle, anyway) -- see
<br>
Aiken's work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chinnery and Turnbull did some calculations showing that mtDNA can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely fluctuate and fix mutations into homozygosity if only random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes are taken into account.
</em><br>
<p>This is one body of work regarding which I tend to have trouble being
<br>
diplomatic.  Patrick Chinnery is an excellent medic, but suffice to say
<br>
that we discussed his hypothesis for accumulation by drift five years
<br>
ago, before he'd published anything embarrassing, and he's still having
<br>
trouble understanding the fundamental inconsistency of that model with
<br>
the data, viz. that it predicts that mitochondrial hyperproliferation 
<br>
will precede (hence be seen in the absence of) COX-negativity, whereas
<br>
with the sole exception of the MELAS mutation (which seems to have a
<br>
special way to win) the reverse is true, we see abundant COX-negative
<br>
cells that lack any mitochondrial hyperproliferation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A mutational ratchet mechanism tends to favor mutated DNA's in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 3 to 1 ratio, but this is not a selective advantage.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what underlies your arrival at this ratio, but one can get
<br>
any ratio one likes with suitable assumptions about rates of mutation
<br>
and turnover.  The most general argument in favour of selection, though,
<br>
is that we know roughly the mitochondrial half-life (a week to a month
<br>
in rats) and thus we know how many mitochondrial generations it takes
<br>
for cells to be taken over -- and it's very, very few, probably only
<br>
a few times the theoretical minimum of log(2) of the number of mtDNAs
<br>
in the cell.  Drift won't do that, whatever the assumptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, once you have mitofection, there are at least two feasible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods to select the mutated mtDNA's out of the cell. Previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts failed because of lack of the ability to introduce DNA into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitos, but this has now changed.
</em><br>
<p>Your turn to lose me.  What are you suggesting, in detail?
