<p><em>&gt; Thanks Hal. Yes, I do remember that thread here now that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because of your intelligent and negative review of the book 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message of that thread I decided not to read the book or the thread. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figured then that I would never read the book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might still be an entertaining read, however. I'll probably read it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually despite what appear to be some valid criticisms by you and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others. Besides, my girlfriend says I *must* read it. In this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case I think I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should do as I am told. I would very much like to engage my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very bright but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-extropian girlfriend in a debate about nanotech as she 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understands it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -gts (a mate who chooses his arguments wisely. :)
</em><br>
<p><p>Two guys are sitting in a bar, drunk. One guy says &quot;Hey, let's have a
<br>
spitting competishun. See that bowl over there, behind th' bar? First one
<br>
that misses buys th' next round.&quot;
<br>
<p>The other guy goes first. He hoikes up a giant loogie, *THWOP*, it flies
<br>
across the bar and into the bowl. The first guy snorts, gargles, and
<br>
*KSPLOORT* a second mucus projectile finds its mark.
<br>
<p>They alternate, hoiking and snorting and gagging, streamlined meteoric
<br>
snotballs following one on the next, hammering home into the bowl like Robin
<br>
Hood meets The Swamp Thing.
<br>
<p>Finally, the first guys says &quot;hey, I'm dryin' up here. How bout this... if
<br>
you drink that whole bowl, I'll buy yer anythin frum the top shelf. Whadya
<br>
say?&quot;
<br>
<p>His mate leans across the bar and grabs the bowl. The quivering mass,
<br>
looking for all the world like the ur-slime of our genesis, is full to the
<br>
brim, little strands dangling gloopily over the side. 
<br>
<p>He lifts it to his lips, and begins to drink, slowly at first then faster,
<br>
gulping, eyes wide with a primitive mixture of horror and fear. His friend
<br>
yells at him to stop, but he wont. He slurps and  swallows until finally he
<br>
has consumed the whole abhorent mess.
<br>
<p>Later in the hospital, his friend, a bottle of Jack in hand, asks him why he
<br>
did it. &quot;I was just jokin'. How come you drunk the whole thing?&quot;
<br>
<p>Slowly, the bedridden man opened his eyes to reddened slits. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Come on. Why, dammit?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Once I had started...&quot; He paused.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Once I had started... I had to finish.&quot; He coughed, then settled. &quot;It was
<br>
all in one piece.&quot;
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>That's what reading Prey is like. You have been warned!
