<p>This is really a meaningless statement. Holding a contrary opinion
<br>
simply for the sake of having a contrary opinion is as morally and
<br>
ethically bankrupt as it gets. Diversity of opinion grows nothing if
<br>
those diverse opinions are absent of any contribution to life, health,
<br>
and progress. 
<br>
<p>While there are many topics in public discourse which one can debate
<br>
for quite a long time: economics, education, what the meaning of 'is'
<br>
is, etc. there are some topics which have time deadlines on them. At
<br>
the go/nogo point, you make the decision and everybody needs to get
<br>
behind it once its been made. Topics of national or individual defense
<br>
are among such time dependent issues.
<br>
<p>If you debate with your wife about buying a gun for the house until
<br>
after your house has been invaded and you've both been killed, you
<br>
might as well not have had the debate at all, as its been decided for
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>While I'm no fan at all of majoritarian tyranny, defense of the
<br>
republic is an area I am quite willing to give some leeway on, so long
<br>
as real and nasty tyrants and terrorists still exist in the world that
<br>
threaten an extropian future. Once the go/nogo point is reached,
<br>
further protests actively aid and abet the enemy by draining public
<br>
safety resources that should be used to maintain homeland security.
<br>
<p>While even peaceful protest provides propaganda aid to the enemy,
<br>
shoring up, for example, Saddam's domestic support and thus increasing
<br>
the threat to US soldiers on the ground, I am willing to submit that
<br>
unless an enemy has us under direct attack (still somewhat vague
<br>
connecting Saddam to bin Laden at this point, but I predict it will
<br>
come out now that Abu Abbas is in custody), that such dissent is
<br>
constitutionally protected, and a price of freedom, so long as the
<br>
dissenters will admit that their dissent does provide propaganda aid to
<br>
the enemy.
<br>
<p>Protesters motives may or may not be pure, but the consequences of
<br>
their actions are certainly not. I think the degree of resistance of
<br>
the Fedeyeen Saddam, as well as the number of foreign arabs in Iraq
<br>
willing to fight the coalition is directly attributable to the amount
<br>
of anti-war protest in the western world.
<br>
<p>What irks me, though, is that such die hard refuseniks never seem to
<br>
admit their error when it is shown they are wrong. History repeatedly
<br>
demonstrates that the arguments of pacifists turn out to be misguided,
<br>
wrong, ill considered, and ultimately harmful to men and women in
<br>
uniform as well as civilians caught in the crossfire. 
<br>
<p>Once tyrannical regimes are deposed, the paper trail ultimately
<br>
demonstrates that such regimes are always even more heinous and
<br>
dastardly than even its worst detractors claim. Pacifists who protest
<br>
against taking action against such evil are the sort of 'good men who
<br>
do nothing' that always allow evil to perpetuate.
