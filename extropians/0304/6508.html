OK, seems to me this whole thing comes down to definition of terms (aka 
<br>
&quot;lawyer's sleight of hand&quot;). My opinions are as follows: I don't consider a 
<br>
&quot;actual threat&quot; as the same thing as a &quot;potential threat&quot;. The analogy about 
<br>
the guy pulling a gun on you can be further dissected like this:
<br>
<p>1. &quot;Potential threat&quot; is that there's some mean-looking guy walking in your 
<br>
direction, who may or may not have a weapon (no direct evidence). This may be 
<br>
a reson for concern, but I'm certainly not going to blow the guy's head off 
<br>
just for looking suspicious. So it comes down to this for defense: 1a.) Use 
<br>
an unjustified &quot;pre-emptive strike&quot; to take the guy out before he becomes an 
<br>
&quot;actual threat&quot;, even if there's no evidence to show he could become one, or 
<br>
1b) Treat him with suspicion and either get away from him or report him to 
<br>
the authorities (Yes I know, this opens up the arguement as to who is the 
<br>
&quot;authority&quot; in this case, but just trying to focus on one issue at a time).
<br>
<p>2. &quot;Clear and present danger&quot; or &quot;actual threat&quot; is when that guy shows you 
<br>
that he's armed (means) AND reaches for his gun (intent). Both of these 
<br>
criteria must be met in order for a defense to this &quot;actual threat&quot; to be 
<br>
justified. So if you see a police officer with his sidearm in plain view, he 
<br>
obviously has the means to impose an &quot;actual threat&quot;, but not the intent.
<br>
<p>My 2 cents,
<br>
<p>Arti
