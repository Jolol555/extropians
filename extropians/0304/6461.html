</em><br>
<p>Yes, I've seen those studies also. They may be among some of the
<br>
(subconscious?) reasons I tend to keep my personal recommendations a little
<br>
shy of Cordain's bold estimates of up to 75% of calories from animal
<br>
sources. Also I've seen other papers by Cordain in which his estimates were
<br>
more modest. I think 40%-50% of calories from animals is a reasonable target
<br>
that stays within the bounds set of paleodiet theory. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And where do free radicals come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from, metabolically?  
</em><br>
<p>They come from many places.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are the &quot;empty calories&quot; of carbs a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleaner burning fuel than protein, without by-products gumming up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works? 
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe so. Excess protein is converted to glucose in a process
<br>
called gluconeogenesis, at which point to follows the same pathways as
<br>
carbs. Offhand I don't recall any research that shows gluconeogenesis as
<br>
generating free-radicals. This is not to say it doesn't.
<br>

<em>&gt; Maybe the Okinawan success come from pure calories + lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antioxidants and stuff + plus some (not much) good protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fat from fish, with a touch of calorie restriction.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the Okinawan diet is unhealthy but I do think it would be a
<br>
lot better without the rice. They should eat even more fish and veggies! 
<br>
<p>We haven't discussed fish much in this thread, but cold-water ocean fish is
<br>
probably among the best foods available. I keep a stock of sardines in my
<br>
cupboard and try to eat several cans per week. 
<br>
<p>If I were forced to live on a deserted island with access to only two foods,
<br>
I would choose sardines and blueberries. I would have blue lips and bad
<br>
breath but I would be healthy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Grape juice or whole wheat bread: which would you rather live on?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; One cannot live on either of these foods alone. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I did always say grains weren't complete, didn't I?  
</em><br>
<p>Actually, no. You wrote a day or two ago: 
<br>
<p>&quot;One test I do is to ask 'what would I be getting if I got all 2000 of my
<br>
calories from this 
<br>
food?' and good breads and pasta hold up decently.&quot;
<br>
<p>I didn't call you on it, Damien, because I figure you didn't have your
<br>
thinking cap on at the time you wrote it. :-)
