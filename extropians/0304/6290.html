<p>Gallup said 72% a few weeks ago, although the number probably fluctuates.

<p>Actually, it does seem to fluctuate a lot, or else Gallup isn't that accurate:

<br>
&quot;worth going to war&quot; went from 67% to 76% from April 7 to April 9.  I suspect
<br>
a lot of this is retrospective: the war seemed to go well, therefore it's
<br>
supportable...
<br>
<p>A majority of us regard France as an ally or friend:

And really, I doubt the French are at all disappointed.
<br>
<p>75% think having good relations with France and Germany is important:

<br>
<p>so if, hypothetically, you disagreed with them, would that make you
<br>
anti-American, since you'd be disagreeing with a supermajority of Americans?
<br>
Originally I was going to ask if the 22% of Americans who didn't support
<br>
Bush's policy (by your statistic) were anti-American, but this works too.
