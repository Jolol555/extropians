University unveils propane fuel cell
<br>
System to power RVs called a breakthrough
<br>

<br>
LA VERNE â€” Scientists at the University of La Verne on Thursday unveiled a 
<br>
&quot;first of its kind&quot; technological innovation that converts propane into 
<br>
electric power without polluting or causing noise.
<br>
<p>The propane fuel cell system, intended for initial use in recreational 
<br>
vehicles, can generate up to 30 kilowatts of electric power with as much as 
<br>
five times the efficiency of other electricity generators.
<br>
<p>&quot;At this point, as far as we know, nobody else has a propane unit that can 
<br>
produce 5 to 20 kilowatts with no detectable impurity,&quot; said Dr. Iraj 
<br>
Parchamazad, chairman of the Chemistry Department at the University of La 
<br>
Verne, who spearheaded the research.
<br>
<p>A presentation of the fuel cell system was made Thursday at the university by 
<br>
Clean Fuel Generation, LLC., a company co-founded by Parchamazad and Nick 
<br>
Ballinger, a ULV graduate and RV industry expert. 
<br>
<p>The company says the technology is ideal for the demands of RV owners because 
<br>
it provides ample power to run various appliances inside a motor home while 
<br>
using less fuel and without making any noise.
<br>
<p>Typical generators create a great deal of noise and vibration, said Ben 
<br>
Ballinger, a representative for Leisure Time Marketing and Nick Ballinger's 
<br>
brother. Noise restrictions at National Parks prevent many RVers from using 
<br>
these generators at night, leaving them without the use of air conditioning 
<br>
or other appliances.
<br>
<p>&quot;This gives them the power they need, and they can still sleep,&quot; Ben 
<br>
Ballinger said.
<br>
<p>While the fuel cell is operating, it also gives off heat that can be used for 
<br>
a water heater or provide space heat inside the coach. The fuel cell's 
<br>
chemical reactions also produce about a half-liter of distilled water per 
<br>
hour, Nick Ballinger said.
<br>
<p>The company's new technology takes propane, mixes it with water and converts 
<br>
it into hydrogen, filtering out any pollutants in the process, Parchamazad 
<br>
said. The fuel cell then transforms the hydrogen into electrical energy.
<br>
<p>CFG unveiled a similar fuel cell system in 2001, using both propane and 
<br>
methanol as fuels. The new technology is an improvement because propane is 
<br>
readily available across the world, even in third world countries, while 
<br>
methanol is more difficult to come by, Ben Ballinger said.
<br>
<p>As soon as it can attract enough investors, the company plans to manufacture 
<br>
and sell the fuel cell system to RV companies and owners.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is equivalent to what Henry Ford had before they went into production,&quot; 
<br>
said Ben Ballinger. &quot;All it's going to take is a little bit of money to get 
<br>
it out on the market.&quot;
<br>
<p>In addition to use in RV's, the company and university also hope the 
<br>
technology can be used to generate energy at hotels, businesses and beyond.
<br>
<p>&quot;We feel fuel cell technology can be and will be an important step toward a 
<br>
sustainable society,&quot; said Dr. Bob Neher, chair of the ULV Natural Science 
<br>
Division, noting its potential to reduce both pollution and the dependence on 
<br>
foreign oil.
<br>
<p>The company also hopes to get its hands on federal grant money for continued 
<br>
research. In his January State of the Union address, President Bush proposed 
<br>
$1.7 billion over the next five years for fuel cell development.
