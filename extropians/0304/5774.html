<em>&gt; &gt; Harvey and Lee raise some very interesting points vis-a-vis whether

<em>&gt; &gt; teleportation has to use the same atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think Lee then said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was astonished early last year to learn that some highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent and thoughtful list members will not teleport.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That is, on my &quot;Seven Levels of Identity&quot;, they are at level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; one or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My conclusion is that Harvey &amp; Lee know different sets of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It could be.  I don't think that I have heard anybody on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that we need to retain our same atoms to retain identity.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is a common misunderstanding that one side assumes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anybody claim this viewpoint for themselves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I advocated at length the last time an identity discussion occured that we
<br>
need to retain a majority of the same atoms as we had the instant before to
<br>
be considered the same person.  Some people interpreted this in a way that
<br>
suggested I thought those particular atoms were in some intrinsic way
<br>
different then every other atom in the universe of the same kind in
<br>
existence.  While there was no intrinsic difference, there was certainly a
<br>
practical one, as those particular atoms are the only ones in the universe
<br>
that are part of the atoms dancing the dance that is you.
<br>
<p>My position is pragmatic, if you copy me, and retain the copy, the original
<br>
and the copy (even if you couldnt tell which is which) both instantly
<br>
experience different stimuli (one is on one side of the copying machine, one
<br>
is on the other, for instance) Since the copy is not experiencing the same
<br>
thing I am, then we are not the same subjective being.  Hence a copy is not
<br>
'me' even though me and the copy are identical in virtually every manner, it
<br>
can not rationally be considered to be a subjective continuation of me,
<br>
since it and my subjective experiences are independant.  Destroying the
<br>
original, as I believe you have pointed out a few times, doesnt elimate the
<br>
problem, if the original were not destroyed it and the copy still
<br>
subjectively experience different stimuli, and thus *must* be different
<br>
subjective beings, although virtually identical.
