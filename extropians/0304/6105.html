<p>### Yes, these events are by all means worthy of mention. You might
<br>
remember that I was very mildly against the war about three weeks ago,
<br>
mainly for financial reasons. Now, I see the joy of Iraqis, and for all
<br>
my stingy impulses, I have a hard time refusing to think our 10e11
<br>
dollars might be money well-spent. The whole situation might still come
<br>
to haunt the US in one way or another, since it ain't over until it's
<br>
over, and it's never over, either, but right now I remember the feeling
<br>
I had in 1989, or 1990, when the much milder but still onerous socialist
<br>
regime in Poland was going down, and I felt quite happy about it.
<br>
<p>Let's hope peace in Iraq will be as successful for the good guys as the
<br>
war was.
