<em>&gt;&gt; Who thinks that we should &quot;choose something nutritionally sound, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a cheeseburger with a slice of tomato and lettuce leaf&quot;? Vegetarians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and health faddists would avoid the meat.  Atkins dieters would avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the bread. Paleo dieters would avoid the cheese.  I am really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; curious. Which diet actually promotes cheeseburgers as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;nutritionally sound&quot;? -- Harvey Newstrom, CISSP, IAM, GSEC, IBMCP
</em><br>
<p>Of course paleodieters like me avoid both the high-carb bread and the
<br>
high-saturated-fat cheese. We also avoid the fatty kinds of meat often used
<br>
for making hamburger. 
<br>
<p>An ideal meal for me is a lean cut of meat or fish or fowl, trimmed of any
<br>
fat, with a salad, perhaps some cooked veggies, and perhaps a piece of
<br>
fruit. I make my salads with fresh nutrient-dense raw spinach leaves (not
<br>
lettuce, which is little more than fiber and water) and I always top them
<br>
with chopped fresh raw broccoli crowns (broccoli contains substances known
<br>
to help prevent cancer). I sometimes add onions and other vegetables, and/or
<br>
chopped nuts, depending on what I have on hand. I sometimes cook some
<br>
vegetables as another side dish but most vegetables taste better to me raw
<br>
and go fine with my salad. I use olive oil as the base of my salad
<br>
dressings. I sprinkle my foods, especially salads, with pepper and other
<br>
spices, but never with salt. Pepper contains a substance shown to increase
<br>
absorption of nutrients in the gut.
<br>
<p>I do not count calories, nor do I count carbs. There are no reasons to count
<br>
anything on a paleodiet. I eat until I'm full and the carbs and calories
<br>
take care of themselves. No hassles, no worries.
<br>
<p>A big piece of lean steak or fish or poultry with a big healthy salad as
<br>
described above is a filling, tasty and healthy meal that no modern diet
<br>
guru can refute! Dr. Atkins would not object, nor would his ideological
<br>
adversaries, Drs. Pritiken and Ornish. 
<br>
<p>As for vegetarians who might object, well, I don't consider vegetarians to
<br>
rate as diet experts in the first place. Most modern vegetarians object to
<br>
the consumption of animal foods on the philosophical grounds that the
<br>
killing of animals adds unneeded suffering to the world, which in my mind
<br>
puts them in the same category with PETA. Vegetarians can no longer call on
<br>
evolutionary evidence to support their claims, thanks to recent discoveries
<br>
of meat-eating hominids dating back millions of years. Some vegetarians can
<br>
object based to the fattiness and unnatural balances of nutrients of the
<br>
meat consumed in the typical American diet, but one is not limited to eating
<br>
only to fatty corn-fed beef.
<br>
<p>The only popular &quot;diet guru&quot; I know of who might allow cheeseburgers w/bun
<br>
is Barry Sears Ph.D., and then only in modest quantities. Sears allows
<br>
almost anything in his diet, provided that one eats with the ratio of
<br>
carbs/fat/protein and other ratios that he recommends. I have mixed feelings
<br>
about Dr. Sears. On the one hand I believe his diet is an improvement over
<br>
the typical American diet but on the other I don't buy most his theories
<br>
about the way in which foods affect certain hormones, particularly
<br>
eicosanoid hormones. His theory about foods as they pertain to eicosanoids
<br>
looks to me like a contrived snow-job designed to help differentiate himself
<br>
from other diet doctors and sell more books. I've found numerous examples of
<br>
sentences in his books stated as &quot;truth&quot; but which appear to be totally
<br>
unsupported by anything other than his own wild-ass conjectures. Still,
<br>
despite these objections, I'd rather see someone on a Sears diet than on
<br>
none at all.
