<p><em>&gt; Do you have any theoretical argument that a vegetarian diet is best for

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter of personal taste with no underlying theory?
</em><br>
<p>There's nothing very &quot;theoretical&quot; about a diet that gets animals
<br>
violently murdered in order to satisfy the needs of a human who doesn't
<br>
*need* to eat meat. And do you mail order all your meat? Sounds like it
<br>
requires as much effort as vegetarianism, if not more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've seen only two theoretical arguments for vegetarianism: 1) the argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that humans have a moral obligation to minimize suffering in the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the suffering of animals, and 2) the argument that humans are best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically adapted to a diet limited only to plant foods. Many vegetarians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embrace both arguments. I object to 1) mainly on philosophical grounds and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 2) mainly on scientific grounds.
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe in morality, but I have an aesthetic appreciation for
<br>
animals, not just as a class, but as individuals. It's a definite lift for
<br>
me to know animals are getting along well, and it's a tragedy when one is
<br>
lost unnecessarily, by something I did and could easily have avoided. It's
<br>
not so much about minimizing suffering as maximizing happiness. Nature
<br>
already kills and tortures animals every day - including humans - but
<br>
humans have the capacity, rarely used, to empathize with others, including
<br>
animals. This empathy is a plus, an expansion of potential happiness.
<br>
<p>Humans seem to have evolved as omnvivores - neither carniverous nor
<br>
herbiverous. We seem to have made a small step toward obligatory
<br>
carnivore, losing the the ability to manufacture b12, but the choice is
<br>
still ours, with b12 supplements readily available, and ethical egg and
<br>
dairy sources. In the future we could probably fix this amino acid problem
<br>
genetically, and take on new energy sources too while we are at it. But
<br>
vegetarianism can't be unhealthy - endless generations of veggie Hindus 
<br>
have made out alright.
