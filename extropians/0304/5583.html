<p>Hmm, I think I will refrain of saying something ad hominem (ad retem?) 
<br>
about that site. But it is hard ;-)
<br>
<p>Looking at <a href="http://web.mit.edu/costa/www/scapital8.pdf">http://web.mit.edu/costa/www/scapital8.pdf</a> one thing that
<br>
really is noticeable is that it says &quot;we argue that the decline in
<br>
social capital has been over-stated.&quot; It also points out that increasing 
<br>
work of women appears to be a relevant factor:
<br>
<p>&quot;Our examination of U.S. trends in social capital produced both inside
<br>
the community and the home showed that on the whole, both types of
<br>
social capital have fallen, with the biggest declines among those
<br>
produced inside the home and moderate declines in those produced within
<br>
the community. Whether the magnitude of the decline social capital
<br>
produced within the community is large enough to cause alarm is in the
<br>
eye of the beholder. We argued that declines among women accounted for
<br>
most of the declines in social capital centered in the home. Women's
<br>
growing committment to careers may therefore play a role in declines in
<br>
social capital. The most important factor explaining the decline in
<br>
social capital centered in the community was rising income inequality,
<br>
but growing ethnic heterogeneity and declines among women played roles
<br>
as well.&quot;
<br>
<p>So maybe ethnic and cultural diversity are less worrying than income 
<br>
disparity?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have always thought that the basic premise that diversity is inherently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial is flawed, just because of the conclusion drawn by the cited paper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have always thought that it was obvious, mainly because it is much easier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the citizenry to control the govt when the populace is homogenous. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see it as obvious at all. There are many other deep cultural 
<br>
factors in control over governments (like power distance, and the ideas 
<br>
about the proper role of government). 
<br>
<p>Diversity is beneficial as potential: more ideas, more meetings are 
<br>
possible. Homogeneous cultures does seem far less likely to innovate
<br>
and can easily stagnate. Diversity causes lots of wasteful conflicts and 
<br>
interactions, but also more creative solutions and resilient networks. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Witness Switzerland and Iceland, and to a (continually) lesser degree, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scandanavia.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, by the definition used in the article of social capital, it has
<br>
definitely decreased here in Sweden (many social organisations are in
<br>
crisis due to lack of volunteers). But diversity is rather
<br>
inhomogeneously distributed, with much more diversity in the
<br>
metropolitan areas than in the rest of the country. But the decrease
<br>
seems (I have no solid research to quote right now) to be distributed
<br>
across the country. Hence I doubt diversity is the issue - unless
<br>
joining the EU and being less insular towards the outside world should
<br>
be defined as diversity-increasing. Income disparity has increased, but 
<br>
not that much. 
<br>
<p><p>Maybe we should turn the question around: what good is social capital? 
<br>
What do we want to use it for? 
<br>
