<p>
There is a certain irony in that we are discussing paleolithic diets
<br>
here, and at the same time it shows one of the best things about
<br>
transhumanism. We take the long view, and acknowledge our evolutionary
<br>
past. Just because we can eat anything today doesn't mean it will do us
<br>
good, and the ancient ways might be better. However, we are not going
<br>
there because they are ancient, just because they fit our *current*
<br>
bodies. I would guess most people here would change diet to something
<br>
even better the day it appears (be it a smarter diet, some supplements
<br>
or a body change). 
<br>
<p>In the long run I guess the goal ought to be to enhance eating as much
<br>
as the rest of the human condition. Like sex was separated from
<br>
reproduction, we can separate nutrition from the aesthetics and culture
<br>
of eating. Right now this isn't possible, and that also brings
<br>
interesting challenges of weaving together food, lifestyle,
<br>
biochemistry, aesthetics and health into something workable - there is
<br>
plenty of room for individual expression here, as we are seeing. I
<br>
wonder if the future where these things are in themselves disentangled
<br>
(we get nutrition from nanofog, metabolic engineering keeps us slim and
<br>
healthy, food can be nanofactured or experienced virtually) how large
<br>
role there will still be for creating elegant compositions of the
<br>
available possibilities. Dieting habits as automorphic art.
