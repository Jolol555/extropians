<p>Hmm, I think I consider myself a sophisticated European (for complex 
<br>
calues of sophisticated and European), and I agree with all three 
<br>
statements above. The trilogy is very much a zeitgeist document, where 
<br>
many referenses are totally opaque to people not from the era but also a 
<br>
collage of ideas from the time that helps make a bit more sense of it. 
<br>
This also makes it a tough read, even beside the psychedelic literary 
<br>
style. There are lots of very interesting ideas strewn around in the 
<br>
mess, some of which have a bearing on transhumanism. But I think Wilson 
<br>
managed to express them much better in his later books, which of course 
<br>
can be seen as merely echoes of the first one. It is like the joke about 
<br>
Philp Glass music: &quot;I have a favourite book by Robert Anton Wilson.&quot; 
<br>
&quot;Which one?&quot; &quot;Any of them&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I have noted that the trilogy has &quot;brainwashing potential&quot; similar to
<br>
certain other books like _Atlas Shrugged_ - people who read it from
<br>
cover to cover do often exhibit interesting changes in outlook. They do
<br>
not necessarily become more sane or smarter, but usually a bit more
<br>
interesting.  Maybe the trilogy can be compared to a certain spiked
<br>
tomato juice...
