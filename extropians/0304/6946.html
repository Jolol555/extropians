</em><br>

<em>&gt;&gt; damage) and thus function more reliably/efficiently.  An increase
</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Yes.  However, as with all aspects of aging, the best solution is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to slow down the progression of the problem (by methods such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulating protein recycling), but to *reverse* that progression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case, our best bet is to find bacterial or fungal enzymes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can break down lipofuscin and introduce them transgenically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with modifications to target them to lysosomes.  The same approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be used to treat atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and macular degeneration -- all of these are caused by aggregates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of stuff that the lysosome lacks the enzymatic machinery to degrade.
</em><br>
<p>### Do you think that protein aggregation is causative in sporadic AD or PD,
<br>
or that it is involved in the pathomechanism at some later stage, perhaps
<br>
amplifying the damage caused by other factors? Recently it turned out that
<br>
APP has a direct toxic effect on mitochondria, and mutant alpha-synuclein
<br>
has also been implicated in diminished mito function.
<br>
<p>Also, are protein aggregates in AD and PD really lysosomal, or cytoplasmic
<br>
(or even extracellular)?
<br>
<p>Atheromas are not aggregates of lysosomally indigestible material, so
<br>
improving cellular digestion is not likely to be of help.
<br>
<p>Is there any indication that lipofuscin is indeed causally involved in cell
<br>
death?
<br>
<p>BTW, I agree that the best way of fighting aging is reversing it by genetic
<br>
engineering (once you get it to work). I like your idea of transferring
<br>
mtDNA-encoded function to the nucleus. Any more information on this project?
