</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I've written some.  Rather crude, and only
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-modifying code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world does it work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The approach I used was some basic genetic algorithms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples of which you should be able to find by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; googling for that, with a fixed judgement package (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my case, comparing to known correct answers over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain number of test cases).  In theory, if one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write a judge to test for &quot;intelligence&quot; (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires defining such), allowing the judge to form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its own questions consistent with some rules so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms are more likely to adapt for the rules than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just for the judge, one could run an approach like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over many many generations.  The difficulties there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in writing a good judge (you can't do manual judging,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since you need short generation times), and the large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of generations - and thus runtime - needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with 1 second generation times, if it takes a billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generations...).  Neither one is a problem to be taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lightly.
</em><br>
<p>Intuitively, I think you need general intelligence to be able to judge
<br>
general intelligence when you see it (even then, it's probably pretty hit &amp;
<br>
miss).
<br>
<p>I think you'd be far more likely to get results by developing an environment
<br>
that requires increasing levels of intelligence to survive, and putting the
<br>
instances into that; survival (or maybe some form of reproduction) is then
<br>
the basis of the fitness function.
<br>
<p>I'd say Eli would see this as a very dangerous approach to AI, but it might
<br>
just get you through the early stages. I think you'd be unlikely to get
<br>
general intelligence popping up in your experiments without a lot of prior
<br>
warning; it seems unlikely that it'd be that easy. 
<br>
<p>So, you might very profitably use a pure evolutionary approach until you get
<br>
something that seems to be able to function at something like the level of a
<br>
human toddler. After that, the path is unclear; you have a bunch of evolved
<br>
(ie: impenetrable) code which you daren't evolve much further. Ideas?
