<p>
What is amazing here is that we all seem to agree on the problem, though 
<br>
how to solve it leads inevitably to contentious debate.
<br>
<p>One can go to the mountaintop, as it were, making of himself a Stalin 
<br>
(for a while) and ponder the remaking the world in a better image. 
<br>
Everything will be fine and dandy (after the initial 100 days of terror, 
<br>
of course). One can think in realpolitic and ignore the individual 
<br>
reality on the ground (as in, for example, dead Iraqi children).
<br>
<p>One can ignore libertarian and extropian approbriations against violent 
<br>
coercion, or Founding Fathers' disdain of foreign entanglement; after 
<br>
all, those Founders didn't face nano or bio driven world-armageddon 
<br>
scenarios. Morality must take a back seat to reality, eh?
<br>
<p>Such has been a morality play often seen on television shows like Star 
<br>
Trek and the like where the temptation is to kill a few to save the 
<br>
many. For me, one of the best answers (from such a show) was the Babylon 
<br>
5 episode where Delenn sparred with the inquisitor (who turned out to be 
<br>
Jack the Ripper). Delenn's answer was that she defended *all life*, that 
<br>
such defense was *local* (dealing with threats around her).
<br>
<p>Personally, I've long been a fan of Israel. I've read several histories 
<br>
of her founding, such as _Oh Jerusalem!_ and _Genesis 1948_, plus 
<br>
several more histories of her wars, including such as Moshe Dayan's 
<br>
_Diary of the Sinai Campaign_ (the '56 war).
<br>
<p>And yet I wonder if the armageddon threat isn't here now. Certainly the 
<br>
United States, along with the vast majority of nations, could survive 
<br>
and come back even after multiple nuclear attacks, while it seems Israel 
<br>
could be destroyed utterly with only 1 to 3 sizable nuclear blasts. It's 
<br>
a very small country.
<br>
<p>As Phil Osborn makes clear, it would be much better to straighten the 
<br>
world out under a anarcho-capitalist systemm as there are many problems 
<br>
with the current state doing it. Perhaps the algorithm then would be:
<br>
<p>IF world-about-to-destroy-itself AND no-anarcho-capitalist options
<br>
THEN make-worldwide-police-state
<br>
<p>But I wonder if the US administration is instead operating under:
<br>
<p>IF Isreal-facing-annihilation
<br>
THEN make-worldwide-police-state
<br>
<p>And I think a lot of the Christian Right in this country want to ensure 
<br>
that Israel remains, so they can say I-told-you-so when Jesus comes 
<br>
back. (Probably the result of an intellectual inferiority complex, as 
<br>
the Jews are possibly the most progressive and intelligent peoples on 
<br>
the planet).
<br>
<p>Now, the antiwar movement 'failed' to stop the war, but it's possible 
<br>
they had a moderating influence. I appreciate that the Pentagon planners 
<br>
went to pains to avoid civilian casualities. If any of that was in any 
<br>
way related to the universal protests, then truly the antiwar movement 
<br>
had an effect.
<br>
<p>I have heard of games of Pong being played on the big screen at football 
<br>
games. The audience shows a red or green card, the cumulative effect 
<br>
moves the paddle up or down. One does what one can, if too much analysis 
<br>
is done to determine which card to show, one misses out on the game. For 
<br>
me, the war was like this: many good reasons to attack, many good 
<br>
reasons to not attack. I decided the latter were better and thus held an 
<br>
antiwar position.
<br>
<p>Contrast this with the pro-war majority, most of whom think that war has 
<br>
become so quick 'n' easy we might as well take on Syria next.
<br>
<p>Hey, maybe if there's a Greater Israel from the Mediterranean to the 
<br>
Euphrates, it wouldn't be so vulnerable to a couple nukes, and we could 
<br>
put off the liberty-vs-police-state decision for a few more decades. 
<br>
That's why I'm waiting for the 'Palestinian Relocation Zones' to appear 
<br>
on the map of Iraq....
