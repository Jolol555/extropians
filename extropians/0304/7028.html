<p>Good point.  I may have once been aware of this but didn't
<br>
take it into account until you and Aubrey mentioned it.
<br>
<p>This is one of the reasons one needs to make genetic engineering
<br>
cheap.  If one could drop the costs of fixing this to the &quot;no-brainer&quot;
<br>
level (which I think one can).  Then people would be more inclined
<br>
to test various solutions.  Since we have a fair amount of knowledge
<br>
now about how EBV maintains itself within cells but not integrated
<br>
into the chromosomes we have a gene therapy strategy that could
<br>
completely avoid the problem of integration into the wrong place
<br>
in the standard chromosome set (something that may now be
<br>
slowing down gene therapy trials).
<br>
<p>So one could design an additional chromosome based on EBV where
<br>
all (most?) of the EBV genes are replaced with recoded mito genes.
<br>
Then one extracts the most primitive stem cells one can find
<br>
in the body, infects them with the anti-aging EBV-based therapy
<br>
vector then amplifies the # you have and puts the modified stem
<br>
cells back into the body.
