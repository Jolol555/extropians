</em><br>
<p>Fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether there are other types of diet which are better than

</em><br>
<p>What does follow, however, is that he knows his 4,000,000 year old paleodiet
<br>
is the best starting point from which to derive his optimal diet. Indeed it
<br>
is the only starting point, as this is the diet he is currently consuming at
<br>
the time the dairy and grain farmers arrive on the scene.
<br>
<p>Consider a more extreme hypothetical to make my point more clear: instead of
<br>
dairy and grain farmers, along come Neolithic &quot;gasoline farmers&quot; who want
<br>
him to start drinking gasoline with each meal. Our man Mr. Hugh M. Species,
<br>
being an educated man with a rational mind, knows better than to drink
<br>
gasoline without first seeing solid scientific evidence that foods from the
<br>
gasoline farmers are worthwhile additions to the diet. He is skeptical of
<br>
the gasoline farmers' claims because 1) he accepts the theory of evolution
<br>
and because 2) he knows he did not evolve on a diet containing gasoline. He
<br>
therefore asserts (just I would) that the burden-of-proof is on those who
<br>
advocate a gasoline diet. If the gasoline farmers can't rise to the
<br>
challenge by offering solid scientific evidence in favor of gasoline
<br>
consumption then our man won't add gasoline to his diet.
<br>
<p>This is the same position I think moderns should take regarding any
<br>
non-paleo food. Where is the evidence that milk and cheese add anything to
<br>
health and longevity? There is none. Likewise with agricultural products.
<br>
There is nothing healthful about these foods that can't be obtained from
<br>
more nutrient-dense paleo foods.
