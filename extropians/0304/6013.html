[I fwd this msg, it seems interesting. s.]
<br>
<p><p>The big news out of the April APS Meeting in Philadelphia this week 
<br>
(as reported by ScienceNow) is the report out of Sandia National Lab 
<br>
of the first ever hydrogen fusion using the Z pinch machine. 
<br>
Supposedly, they managed to compress the fuel pallet &quot;... by a factor 
<br>
of 10, heated it up to over 2 million degrees kelvin, and created a 
<br>
microscopic hydrogen bomb in a bottle&quot;. Such a device, of course, is 
<br>
being considered as one viable technique in generating fusion energy 
<br>
source.
<br>
<p>Until such results are published, we don't have anymore details on 
<br>
this. You may read the details of the Z pinch machine at the link 
<br>
below:

<br>
<p>On a personal note related to this, when I was an undergraduate, we 
<br>
made this contraption for an engineering Expo that we call the Theta 
<br>
Pinch (there was another unofficial name for it but it is too vulgar 
<br>
to put on here :)). It consisted basically of a very large capacitor 
<br>
that we can get a very high current from when we discharge it, 
<br>
connected to a solenoid surrounding a hollow tube that can fit a 
<br>
typical aluminum drinks can. When you discharge the capacitor through 
<br>
the solenoid, the large, time-varying current flowing through it 
<br>
causes a big axial magnetic field in the solenoid. Since this field 
<br>
is also time varying, via Lenz's Law, it will induce a  separate 
<br>
current in the metallic can. The combination of this current in the 
<br>
can and the magnetic field causes a Lorentz force large enough to 
<br>
crush the can inwards (radially) in one single shot! This also caused 
<br>
a loud &quot;POP&quot;.
<br>
<p>We were a big hit, to say the least, especially with the kids who 
<br>
liked the &quot;sound effect&quot; and seeing the cans being squashed without 
<br>
any visible physical contact. We went through at least 400 aluminum 
<br>
cans during the 2-day Expo. Most of us were also on a sugar high from 
<br>
having to drink all those sugary sodas.
<br>
<p>Zz.
