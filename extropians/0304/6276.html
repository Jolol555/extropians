After reading this latest email from the Skeptics list, I thought some of
<br>
you may be interested in the two books featured here.  I've not read them
<br>
(and am continually - no, permanently - behind in my reading), but the
<br>
subjects look tantalizing.

<em>&gt; ------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TWO NEW SKEPTICS BOOKS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Skeptic Magazine Senior Editor Frank Miele has recently authored two books
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; wanted to alert everyone to. Frank has been a vital part of the
</em><br>
development
<br>
<em>&gt; and editing of Skeptic magazine articles, theme issues, and interviews, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well as Skeptics Society Caltech lectures, symposia, and conferences. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleased to recommend these two important contributions to some of the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial ideas in science and culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence, Race, Genetics: Conversations with Arthur R. Jensen
</em><br>
(Boulder,
<br>
<em>&gt; CO: Westview Press) and The Battlegrounds of Bio-Science: Cross-Examining
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Experts on Evolutionary Psychology, Race, Intelligence, and Genetics, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Population, Environment, and Cloning (Bloomington, IN: 1stBooks Library)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Intelligence, Race, and Genetics: Conversations with Arthur R. Jensen
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; favorably reviewed by Intelligence and Metapsychology, recommended by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; editors of Scientific American (Nov. 2002), becoming the best seller on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; SciAm on-line bookstore in its first month after publication, and endorsed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by, among others, sociobiologist E. O. Wilson:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The work of an honest, courageous man, interviewing an honest, courageous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man&quot; --E. O. Wilson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Miele asks the hard questions and Jensen answers without blinking. A must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read for critics and supporters alike.&quot; --Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Professor of Psychology, University of Minnesota
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Arthur Jensen has received endless criticism, much of it vituperative.
</em><br>
Yet,
<br>
<em>&gt; he has remained moderate in tone and has repeatedly been more data
</em><br>
oriented,
<br>
<em>&gt; more quantitative, more thorough, more scholarly, and more knowledgeable
</em><br>
than
<br>
<em>&gt; his critics. Here is a chance for those who have not read his technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing to learn his mature views in easily accessible, question and
</em><br>
answer
<br>
<em>&gt; form.&quot;  --James Crow, Professor Emeritus of Genetics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         University of Wisconsin-Madison
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;An excellent introduction, overview and update about the man and the
</em><br>
science
<br>
<em>&gt; behind the 'ism' of Jensenism. In clear and candid dialogue, Jensen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unflinchingly answers hard questions about the policy implications of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life's work.&quot; --Professor Robert Plomin, MRC Research Professor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There is no more important subject than how we as a society best utilize
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; precious gift of human intelligence. It is a tribute to Professor Jensen
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; his skeptical inquisitor Frank Miele that Intelligence, Race, and Genetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successfully challenges the usual ideological posturing on this taboo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject. This is science at its best: cautious and audacious, gripping and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; timely.&quot; --Jon Entine, author of Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt;         Why We're Afraid to Talk About It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;For those who have learned of 'Jensenism' and Arthur Jensen from the
</em><br>
popular
<br>
<em>&gt; press, this is a 'must read' book. Frank Miele asks the tough questions an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informed skeptic should ask and gets answers understandable to the layman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if you have read everything Jensen has written, you will learn a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the man and his work.&quot; --Douglas K. Detterman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Professor of Psychology, Case Western Reserve University
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The Battlegrounds of Bio-Science brings together in one volume Miele's

<em>&gt; DEMON-HAUNTED BRAIN
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Occasionally one of my monthly columns in Scientific American (&quot;Skeptic&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draws an extraordinary amount of mail. The March column, entitled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Demon-Haunted Brain, is one of those. The general criticism was that just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because apparent paranormal phenomena can be replicated through brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulation of various types does not mean that the paranormal phenomena
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; not real. Here is the column, or you can just go to <a href="http://www.sciam.com">http://www.sciam.com</a>
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; download it there (along with the latest column on cloning entitled &quot;I
</em><br>
Clone&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; that includes my analogue to Asimov's three laws of robotics in the &quot;three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws of cloning&quot;; as well as all past columns).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SKEPTIC  March, 2002
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Demon Haunted Brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the brain mediates all experience then paranormal phenomena are nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than neuronal events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Shermer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Five centuries ago demons haunted our world, with incubi and succubi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tormenting their victims as they lay asleep in their beds. Two centuries
</em><br>
ago
<br>
<em>&gt; spirits haunted our world, with ghosts and ghouls harassing their
</em><br>
sufferers
<br>
<em>&gt; all hours of the night. Last century aliens haunted our world, with grays
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; greens abducting captives out of their beds and whisking them away for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probing and prodding. Today people are experiencing out of body
</em><br>
experiences,
<br>
<em>&gt; floating above their beds, out of their bedrooms, and even off the planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is going on here? Are these elusive creatures and mysterious
</em><br>
phenomena
<br>
<em>&gt; in our world or in our minds? New evidence indicates that they are, in
</em><br>
fact,
<br>
<em>&gt; a product of the brain. Neuroscientist Michael Persinger, in his
</em><br>
laboratory
<br>
<em>&gt; at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Canada, for example, can induce all
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; these experiences in subjects by subjecting their temporal lobes to
</em><br>
patterns
<br>
<em>&gt; of magnetic fields (I tried it and had a mild out-of-body experience).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, the September 19, 2002 issue of Nature, reported that the Swiss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscientist Olaf Blanke and his colleagues discovered that they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring about out-of-body experiences through electrical stimulation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right angular gyrus in the temporal lobe of a 43-year old woman suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from severe epileptic seizures. In initial mild stimulations she reported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sinking into the bed&quot; or &quot;falling from a height.&quot; More intense
</em><br>
stimulation
<br>
<em>&gt; led her to &quot;see myself lying in bed, from above, but I only see my legs
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; lower trunk.&quot; Another stimulation induced &quot;an instantaneous feeling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'lightness' and 'floating' about two meters above the bed, close to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ceiling.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a related study reported in the 2001 book Why God Won't Go Away,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researchers Andrew Newberg and Eugene D'Aquili found that when Buddhist
</em><br>
monks
<br>
<em>&gt; meditate and Franciscan nuns pray their brain scans indicate strikingly
</em><br>
low
<br>
<em>&gt; activity in the posterior superior parietal lobe, a region of the brain
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; authors have dubbed the Orientation Association Area (OAA), whose job it
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; to orient the body in physical space (people with damage to this area have
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; difficult time negotiating their way around a house). When the OAA is
</em><br>
booted
<br>
<em>&gt; up and running smoothly there is a sharp distinction between self and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-self. When OAA is in sleep mode--as in deep meditation and
</em><br>
prayer--that
<br>
<em>&gt; division breaks down, leading to a blurring of the lines between reality
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; fantasy, between feeling in body and out of body. Perhaps this is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens to monks who experience a sense of oneness with the universe, or
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; nuns who feel the presence of God, or with alien abductees floating out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their beds up to the mother ship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes trauma can trigger such experiences. The December 2001 issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lancet published a Dutch study in which of 344 cardiac patients
</em><br>
resuscitated
<br>
<em>&gt; from clinical death, 12 percent reported near-death experiences, where
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; had an out-of-body experience and saw a light at the end of a tunnel. Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even described speaking to dead relatives. Since our normal experience is
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; stimuli coming into the brain from the outside, when a part of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abnormally generates these illusions another part of the brain interprets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them as external events. Hence, the abnormal is thought to be the
</em><br>
paranormal.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These studies are only the latest to deliver blows against the belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind and spirit are separate from brain and body. In reality, all
</em><br>
experience
<br>
<em>&gt; is mediated by the brain. Large brain areas like the cortex coordinate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imputes from smaller brain areas such as the temporal lobes, which
</em><br>
themselves
<br>
<em>&gt; collate neural events from still smaller brain modules like the angular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gyrus. This reduction continues all the way down to the single neuron
</em><br>
level,
<br>
<em>&gt; where highly-selective neurons, sometimes described as &quot;grandmother&quot;
</em><br>
neurons
<br>
<em>&gt; fire only when subjects see someone they know. Caltech neuroscientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christof Koch and Gabriel Kreiman, in conjunction with UCLA neurosurgeon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Itzhak Fried have even found a single neuron that fires when the subject
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; shown a photograph of Bill Clinton. The Monica neuron must be closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, we are not aware of the workings of our own electrochemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems. What we actually experience is what philosophers call qualia, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective states of thoughts and feelings that arise from a concatenation
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; neural events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is the fate of the paranormal and the supernatural to be subsumed into
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; normal and the natural. In fact, there is no paranormal or supernatural;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is only the normal and the natural--and mysteries yet to be
</em><br>
explained.
<br>
<em>&gt; It is the job of science, not pseudoscience, to solve those puzzles with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural, not supernatural, explanations.
