<p><em>&gt; I have noticed on the list that anybody who critisizes

</em><br>
<p>That is just your imagination, Brian.  Please find where
<br>
any particular person has been so branded.  (Even if you
<br>
were to succeed---which I think unlikely---you will still
<br>
find that there is argument advanced to support the
<br>
contention.)  But I realize that you are reacting to
<br>
Michael Dickey's 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [Brian wrote]

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; There has never been reasonable proof that

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Brian Booth says that America shouldn't react
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because there was no reasonable proof that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; USA was threatened.  There has always been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable proof that Iraq was a threat to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; states.  Sometimes Brian Booth's blind anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Americanism is beyond belief.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Brian, I hope this post illustrates the futility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of your post.... then your comments serve to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing except preach to the choir. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Regards, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<p>Michael made it perfectly clear that he was just echoing
<br>
your insult.  The deeper point here (that Michael was
<br>
trying to convey but I think that you missed) was that
<br>
there is very little content to saying that someone's
<br>
&quot;blind patriotism is beyond belief&quot;.   It is about as
<br>
empty as saying that someone's &quot;anti-Americanism is
<br>
beyond belief&quot;.
<br>
<p>Perhaps insults are or are not warranted on this list---
<br>
there has been some good discussion of this---but if they
<br>
are, they *must* be backed up with argument.  Otherwise,
<br>
they're just what are often called &quot;flames&quot;, right?
