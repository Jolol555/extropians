Damien from CalTech queried:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Where'd the obsession with complexity come from? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It all started as a small child when my 1st great teacher said...
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Spin your bits all you want and it won't tell
<br>
you what's going on *over there*.  Well, to some extent: you can make big
<br>
telescopes and such.  But ultimately you can't beat going over and taking a
<br>
close look.  Maybe the complexity you generate at home is more interesting
<br>
than finding new varieites of rock and beetle and stellar instability.  OTOH,
<br>
the real has a certain cachet from being able to lethally surprise you.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We ride the horses we are put on, we play the hand we're dealt. Right now, it 
<br>
is usually easier to make scientific and technological answers with 
<br>
computing, then it is to spend billions and send spacecraft elsewhere. Yes, 
<br>
we do indeed require both, however, medical advances using combinational 
<br>
chemistry have produced some useful finds. Jef's question was, whether an 
<br>
advanced civilization would find it more production to use materials at hand 
<br>
(solar system) then send interstellar spacecraft on a 100 year journey. 
<br>
Complexity would suggest, at this point, that its easier for advanced 
<br>
civilizations to observe remotely, and sift thru data; then some arduous, 
<br>
energy expensive journey cross the stars.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;And you can make it a solid sphere, with a probe in every system to monitor 
<br>
it
<br>
for changes.  Possibly not too exciting in the average red dwarf system (but
<br>
you never know for sure) but good for those potential life-producers and the
<br>
stars which go boom.  Signals schmignals; if there were advanced life out
<br>
there there should be something watching us now... which would have been
<br>
parked here since before the dinosaurs bought it.
<br>
<p>-xx- Damien X-)  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Not necessarilly so! Because of Gamma Ray Bursters, bouncing boulders of 
<br>
asteroids, planetismals, traveling neutron stars and energized black holes, 
<br>
the early cosmos and our galaxy, could easily have had life wiped out and 
<br>
recreated 20 times in a 12.7 billion year old universe. Us carbonaceous 
<br>
thingies, may not have had a decent chance until this chipper, Goldilocks 
<br>
era, where &quot;everything is just right.&quot; 
<br>
Therefore we may be one of the 1st to wake up, rather then some wise and 
<br>
ancient space clouds, or arthropods. Brain-life may be, not increasingly 
<br>
rare, but increasingly common, over the next few billion years. This era 
<br>
neighbors worth talking to, might be vanishingly rare, but in the amazing 
<br>
year 5 Billion, we may be the ones who are demanded thus: &quot;Q! Release my 
<br>
ship!&quot;  or more likely,  &quot;Burch, Release my ship!&quot;
