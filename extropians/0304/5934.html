<p>Actually this &quot;article&quot; was an April Fools gag.  This
<br>
year was kind of a dud.  I didn't even attempt a gag
<br>
because we weren't in much of a laughing mood with
<br>
the war going on.  May it be over soon, oh evolution,
<br>
may this madness be over and sanity return to this
<br>
small planet.

<br>
<p>ps, I have been doing some extrapolations on war, and
<br>
the results are not so discouraging.  Comparing 20th
<br>
century conflicts such as the two world wars with the
<br>
current war, we see some interesting trends.  In the
<br>
first world war, we saw miles-long lines of guys attacking
<br>
each other, use of chemical weapons, utterly horrifying
<br>
loss of life.  In world war 2, we saw intentional bombing
<br>
of civilian sites as well as the use of WMDs.  In the
<br>
later 20th century conflicts we saw conventional wars
<br>
between powers where both had far more destructive
<br>
weapons (nukes) but did not use them.
<br>
<p>Now we have a war in which there are certainly casualties,
<br>
but it is actually far more than ever before an information
<br>
war. {&quot;There are no Americans in Baghdad!&quot; said the Minister
<br>
of Information, raising his voice to be heard over the
<br>
clatter of small arms fire.}  Enormous expense is being
<br>
borne by the attackers to minimize civilian casualties,
<br>
and infrastructure damage is also being minimized where
<br>
practical.  Certainly the duration of conflict has
<br>
been greatly reduced from before.
<br>
<p>Could we not extrapolate to a future where wars occur
<br>
in such a way that very little actual property damage
<br>
occurs, most of the population is unaffected, and indeed
<br>
are unaware that a war occurred?  Could we be approaching
<br>
the dream future in which political leaders fight out
<br>
their differences and leave the rest of us to lead our
<br>
own lives in peace?  Finally, are we on the eve of
<br>
construction?
