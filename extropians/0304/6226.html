<em>&gt; experiences of being both an American woman with all the freedom that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entails and a woman who lived as a Muslim woman, at times complete with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hijab, among Arab Muslims for years. This experience, which I claim, is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informs my view when I say that the women of Iraq, in spite of being more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberated that their Saudi counterparts, are still entitled to the label
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;un-liberated&quot;.  It doesn't take a government to oppress women. The
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't know that much about the women of Iraq; most comes from a
<br>
mid-1990s Economist article, on how Iraq was becoming more religious under
<br>
sanctions, with Baghdad women who'd been proud of their Western hairstyles
<br>
turning to the veil.  And Iraqi suffrage is universal, as is Iran's.  Not
<br>
terribly meaningful under the Baath party, but they got their fake vote just
<br>
like everyone else... only 45% female literacy in Iraq though, according to
<br>
the CIA (vs. 66% in Iran.)  So, I don't know.  I'd just caution you against
<br>
assuming the Arab Muslims of Iraq are the same as the Arab Muslims elsewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Iraq's Hussein may have headed a secular government, and I have not been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; student of government; however, how secular can a government truly be when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that government takes government funds to build religious worship sites?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein built mosques; he was in the process of building what was to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest mosque in the world.  Doesn't a truly secular government mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there must be a separation of mosque and state?
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One thing to note is that Saddam's religious activity pretty much dates to
<br>
after Gulf War I and sanctions and all that.  Part of painting himself as a
<br>
new Saladin against the Christian imperialists of America.  There's a big
<br>
&quot;catering to public opinion&quot; aspect here.
<br>
<p>But perhaps more to the point is that no, total separation isn't necessary.
<br>
Many if not most of the countries of Europe have state-supported churches --
<br>
Britain and the Anglicans, various countries with their Lutheran churches.
<br>
Yet they're functionally pretty secular -- sometimes more so than the United
<br>
States, with stricter constitutional separation, but more mixing from the
<br>
beliefs of the politicians and the populace.
<br>
<p>More germane to our concerns, I'd propose, is the extent of Islamic law, as
<br>
opposed to Islamic subsidy.  And I think Iraq was quite distinct from the
<br>
theocracy and sharia of Iran and Saudi Arabia.  Possibly Hussein was moving in
<br>
that direction, or would have if he thought it'd help him, but it's hard to
<br>
tell.
