</em><br>
<p>I don't think we can say that it failed to predict a cataclysm for any
<br>
ancient roman who might have invoked it. Rome was relatively recent in terms
<br>
of human history. If doomsday is scheduled for 3000 A.D., for example, then
<br>
any ancient Roman who invoked the DA would still look pretty smart in the
<br>
year 3001.
<br>
<p>In greater terms, my point is that if doomsday is going to happen sometime
<br>
soon, say in the next one to two thousand years, then the vast majority of
<br>
humans ever to have lived would have been correct to predict an early
<br>
doomsday for humanity. This is so because the population has expanded more
<br>
or less exponentially. A few prehistoric people bright enough to have
<br>
considered such things (assuming there were any) would look wrong or at
<br>
least extremely early in their predictions, but those wrong predictors would
<br>
make up only a small minority of humans ever to have lived. So then your
<br>
argument that it didn't work in the past is offset by the fact that we can't
<br>
say for certain that it didn't work in the past; if it works for us in the
<br>
present then it will have worked for the vast majority of people in the
<br>
past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To be even more clear, let's perform the following thought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment. Let's say mankind or our offspring lifeforms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive in the universe for several trillion more years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At every step along the way, the DA argument would seem true 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and at almost all of those steps it would be wrong.
</em><br>
<p>But here your conclusion is contained in your premise.
