<p><em>&gt; &gt;    I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    States of America, and to the republic for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    which it stands, one nation indivisible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    liberty and justice for all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; American patriots are those individuals who can read these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words, and agree with every nuance of sentiment they contain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and who indeed are themselves allied with that republic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you /had/ to recite it, then it's meaningless; you were just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following the crowd.
</em><br>
<p>It's perhaps hard to credit, but a lot of history was created by
<br>
people who acted as a part of something larger than themselves;
<br>
who believed that they were a part of a nation, or who believed
<br>
that they had a people.  I understand that this does not resonate
<br>
with some very strong individualists, for whom practically all
<br>
communal feeling is alien.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you've ever /freely chosen/ to recite it, then I might think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it had some meaning.  I certainly never have, and never will,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to willingly pledge allegiance to a piece of cloth, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's just me.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; symbolism also plays a factor in many people's thinking, but
<br>
not everyone's.  A number of people are really moved by the symbols
<br>
of their nation, or of their ideological movement.  But certainly
<br>
not everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The republic for which it stands is of course a different matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'm not sure &quot;allegiance&quot; is something I can admire there either.
</em><br>
<p>Patriotism is not for everyone.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; A country is only as good as its guiding principles.  I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love the country just because I happen to be in it.
</em><br>
<p>This is getting to the core idea.  Suppose that you had been a
<br>
member of a small Indian tribe, say the Menominee, to be specific.
<br>
You grow up noticing that many people have a peculiar loyalty
<br>
to the Menominee, and even join in raids that you had opposed
<br>
against other tribes.  You moreover note that many seem to value
<br>
the *existence* of the tribe in a way that transcended the particular
<br>
people of the tribe---that is, they value the traditions and mores
<br>
of the Menominee, and that it was *not* though any allegiance
<br>
to various abstract principles that command their loyalty to the
<br>
tribe.  Rather they feel that way about Menominee as members of a
<br>
*group*.
<br>
<p>Do you think that you would have found this alien to your way
<br>
of thinking?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Patriotism, or love of country, is not the same [as endorsement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of principle] at all.  Either you have a deep emotional bond to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an actual nation and its people, or you do not.  Perhaps only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; small majority of the members of most Western nations today have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a loyalty.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; If that is all patriotism is then it is worthless.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as I said to Lee Daniel, patriotism isn't for everyone.
<br>
<p>Lee
