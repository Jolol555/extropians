<em>&gt; (Hal Finney &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Bad%20ideas%20from%20Microsoft%20et%20al">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying that a system which allows people to voluntarily agree to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bind themselves to restrictions on the exchange of information is evil?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like, using Palladium to prove that I am running Windows Media Player,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a condition for downloading some music?  Which of us is being evil:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the server who will only download data to people who are running WMP;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the person who runs WMP and downloads data, accepting limitations on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its use; the person who designed and sold this technology?
</em><br>
<p>This is really the core of the issue, and it's a very hard question.
<br>
As a libertarian, certainly the knee-jerk response should be to allow
<br>
more choices. But I think the choices here are illusory. One cannot
<br>
separate the rights to use content from the content itself. A movie
<br>
that I can view once on one machine is a very different product from
<br>
a movie that I own and can view anywhere, any time, and analyze, and
<br>
take clips from, etc.  But the truth is that even if I agree to buy
<br>
only the former product, the latter one still exists for the same
<br>
price for those people who have technology to break to lock--and there
<br>
will always be such technology. It simply isn't physically possible
<br>
to fully control use of the content.
<br>
<p>Since I can assume that copying technology will exist, and that full
<br>
rights-enabled content will be available to me whether I agree to the
<br>
restrictions or not, why would I agree to the restrictions? The only
<br>
reason would be if the /law/ prevented me from using the rights-enabled
<br>
content, as it might be argued that copyright law does (although even
<br>
there, it's not clear; do the&quot;fair use&quot; provisions allow me to show
<br>
clips to a film class even if I have to crack encryption to do so?)
<br>
<p>So the only way for the rights-limited content to have any value is
<br>
for the law to recognize the author's rights to restrict access to
<br>
his creations, and for the many reasons I've outlined on this forum
<br>
and elsewhere, I don't support such laws. This technology legitimizes
<br>
those laws: it makes the assumption that the author has the right to
<br>
control access to information made public, and provides a means of
<br>
enforcing that assumption. But it wouldn't be valuable without the
<br>
laws behind it, and it's the laws I really object to.
<br>
<p>So there's the clearer answer, I hope: I don't object so much to the
<br>
technology itself, but I object to the /laws/ that are required to
<br>
make the tecnology useful.  I object to the very concept that authors
<br>
have the power to do what this tecnology purports to enable.
<br>
