<p>It's not a usual lens.  I (disagree/don't know enough about the physics
<br>
to agree with) Spudboy's supposed applications of the lens.  The
<br>
benefits of these lenses over the standard type is that, over certain
<br>
frequency ranges, they can amplify the higher order components of light
<br>
that are only usually noticeable close to the source, letting you focus
<br>
light down to less than the usual half-a-wavelength size.
<br>
I've pasted an old (April 2001) but relevant New Scientist article
<br>
below:
<br>
<p><p>Perfect focus
<br>
<p>New Scientist vol 170 issue 2286 - 14 April 2001, page 35
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>A material born from one physicist's flight of fancy could revolutionise
<br>
a medical imaging technique and answer the computer industry's prayers,
<br>
says Justin Mullins
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>MORE than three decades ago, an obscure Russian physicist invented a
<br>
freakish material. It was not a real material that could be bent or
<br>
broken. Instead, Victor Veselago had dreamed up an imaginary substance,
<br>
and wondered what unworldly properties it might have. A harmless
<br>
pursuit, you might think, for someone working at the General Physics
<br>
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. But Veselago's
<br>
work was no an idle flight of fancy.
<br>
<p>On the contrary, it was built on the soundest of scientific
<br>
foundations—the laws of electromagnetism laid down by James Clerk
<br>
Maxwell one hundred years before, that describe how light behaves as it
<br>
passes through any medium. Veselago's whim was to change the value of
<br>
two of the constants in Maxwell's equations from positive to negative.
<br>
He wanted to know what properties such a material might have, and also
<br>
hoped to have a little fun finding out.
<br>
<p>He immediately realised that his creation would behave in some very
<br>
strange ways. Veselago even came to Europe in the early 1970s to promote
<br>
his ideas, but his work was regarded as little more than a curiosity.
<br>
<p>That changed last year when physicists announced that they had finally
<br>
created his fantasy material. It is unlike any substance ever seen. It
<br>
has a structure like a distorted honeycomb and contains wires and
<br>
strange electronic components rigidly suspended in repeating patterns.
<br>
The announcement prompted a flurry of theoretical and practical work on
<br>
its properties. And amazingly, this has revealed that Veselago's
<br>
material, and others like it, are more remarkable and useful than even
<br>
he had imagined.
<br>
<p>Over a century before Veselago's thought experiment, Maxwell had
<br>
developed his equations to describe the way electromagnetic waves such
<br>
as light pass through things like glass, water and air. But rather than
<br>
working out exactly how the two components of light—oscillating electric
<br>
and magnetic fields—vary at every point in a particular material,
<br>
Maxwell realised that it was possible to simplify the calculations by
<br>
taking a kind of average of the fields throughout the material.
<br>
<p>He found that for a given frequency of light, this averaging introduces
<br>
a constant factor into his equations. In the case of the magnetic field,
<br>
this averaging factor is called the magnetic permeability, and for the
<br>
electric field it is the electrical permittivity. These constants are
<br>
especially useful to scientists and engineers because they describe the
<br>
overall behaviour of light as it passes through the material and can be
<br>
used to determine quantities such as the speed of light in that medium
<br>
and its refractive index—how much it bends light.
<br>
<p>So what happened when Veselago created his imaginary substance by
<br>
changing the value of these constants to -1? Inside his fantasy
<br>
material, the usual relationship between the electric and magnetic
<br>
fields was reversed.
<br>
<p>Light consists of an electric field and a magnetic field oscillating at
<br>
right angles to each other and to the direction in which the light is
<br>
travelling (see Diagram). Physicists have a trick for remembering how
<br>
these three are oriented, known as the right-hand rule. Arrange the
<br>
thumb, forefinger and middle finger of the right hand in such a way that
<br>
they point at right angles to each other. The thumb represents the
<br>
direction that the light is travelling, the forefinger represents the
<br>
plane of the electric field and the middle finger the plane of the
<br>
magnetic field.
<br>
<p><p>In Veselago's material, however, these quantities obey a left-hand rule,
<br>
as if they were reflected in a mirror—which is why they're called
<br>
&quot;left-handed materials&quot;.
<br>
<p>A left-handed material should have some strange properties. It should
<br>
have a negative refractive index, for example, which means that light
<br>
entering it would bend in the opposite direction to light passing
<br>
through conventional materials. And the Doppler effect would also work
<br>
in reverse: normally the frequency of light passing through glass
<br>
increases slightly when the source is getting closer. In left-handed
<br>
materials, though, its frequency would decrease.
<br>
<p>But Veselago never got his hands on a left-handed material. Although the
<br>
permittivity of some natural materials such as ionised gases can be
<br>
negative, the permeability of naturally occurring materials never drops
<br>
below zero. So Veselago was unable to prove his predictions with real
<br>
materials.
<br>
<p>But in 1996, John Pendry, a theoretical physicist at Imperial College,
<br>
London, began thinking about designing new materials. He and his team
<br>
investigated the effect that a regular array of thin, parallel
<br>
conducting wires would have on a particular kind of electromagnetic
<br>
radiation—microwaves. They predicted that the average effect of the
<br>
wires would make it look as if the waves were moving through a material
<br>
with negative electrical permittivity.
<br>
<p>Pendry reasoned that if simple wires could produce such an exotic
<br>
medium, why not arrays of other electrical components? So he began to
<br>
calculate the bulk properties of other strange concoctions. In 1999, he
<br>
published theoretical calculations for a number of other materials. One
<br>
in particular caught the eye of David Smith and his colleagues at the
<br>
University of California in San Diego.
<br>
<p>&quot;It was a very unusual and very unexpected effect,&quot; says Smith. What
<br>
Pendry was predicting was that a structure consisting of a periodic
<br>
arrangement of simple electronic components would have a magnetic
<br>
permeability that was negative at microwave frequencies. The electrical
<br>
components were split ring resonators—C-shaped circuits about the size
<br>
of the capital Cs in this article. Smith and his colleagues immediately
<br>
set about trying to prove Pendry's results experimentally.
<br>
<p>Creating an array of split ring resonators is not difficult. The team
<br>
simply printed C-shaped copper circuits onto a sheet of fibreglass using
<br>
the conventional lithographic techniques used to make circuit boards.
<br>
They then cut up the sheets and stacked the slices, like a loaf of
<br>
sliced bread. But they decided they might as well go further and create
<br>
a material with both negative permittivity and permeability—a truly
<br>
left-handed material.
<br>
<p>Thanks to Pendry's earlier work, modifying the material to give it a
<br>
negative permittivity turned out to be relatively straightforward. Smith
<br>
simply inserted arrays of fine wires into the gaps between the sheets of
<br>
resonators. Without the wires, the material absorbs microwaves at more
<br>
or less all frequencies. But when the arrays were inserted, the group
<br>
discovered that microwaves of around 5 gigahertz could pass through.
<br>
They also found evidence that the orientation of the electric and
<br>
magnetic fields was reversed, just as Veselago had predicted. The
<br>
conclusion was inescapable. Smith and his colleagues had created the
<br>
world's first left-handed material.
<br>
<p>Their results were published last year to general acclaim, and new
<br>
studies are underway. Meanwhile, Pendry continues to make new
<br>
predictions for these materials.
<br>
<p>Last October, he published the results of an investigation into the
<br>
electromagnetic properties of left-handed materials on a scale of a few
<br>
nanometres—in a region known as the &quot;near field&quot;. The near field is a
<br>
kind of twilight zone close to the light source in which the electric
<br>
and magnetic fields behave wildly. On this scale there are all kinds of
<br>
components to the field that you never normally see, says Pendry. These
<br>
components are called evanescent waves and they die away rapidly as they
<br>
travel from the source, such as an excited atom in a light bulb. After a
<br>
few wavelengths the evanescent waves are so weak that physicists can
<br>
safely ignore them.
<br>
<p>But evanescent waves cause one of the biggest headaches in optical
<br>
physics. When evanescent waves fade away, the fine detail they contain
<br>
about the source is lost. So no matter how good a lens is at focusing
<br>
light, it can never create a perfect image of the source without the
<br>
near field—there will always be an inherent &quot;fuzziness&quot;, which means
<br>
scientists can't focus light to a spot much smaller than its wavelength.
<br>
This restriction is known as the diffraction limit and it causes
<br>
problems in all kinds of applications. For example, it limits the size
<br>
of transistors that can be carved using photolithographic techniques and
<br>
the amount of information that DVDs can store.
<br>
<p>Pendry discovered that, in theory, left-handed materials can have a
<br>
remarkable restorative effect on evanescent waves and even focus them to
<br>
create a perfect image of the source. Nobody was more surprised at this
<br>
than Pendry himself. &quot;It's a very unusual and surprising idea and I
<br>
didn't expect it to work,&quot; he says. But his mathematics was checked and
<br>
rechecked and the work was published in Physical Review Letters (vol 85,
<br>
p 3966).
<br>
<p>The focusing works very differently from a conventional lens. Imagine a
<br>
light source placed just nanometres from a thin slab of left-handed
<br>
material. The source emits light, including evanescent waves, which
<br>
enter the material making electrons in it oscillate. Since the slab is
<br>
very thin, the light and evanescent waves pass through, causing
<br>
electrons on the far surface to oscillate as well. The movement of
<br>
electrons on one surface affects movement on the other, through the
<br>
electric field, and at one particular frequency they begin to resonate.
<br>
It is this resonance that amplifies the evanescent waves as they leave
<br>
the medium.
<br>
<p>The material has a negative refractive index, so the flat slab focuses
<br>
the light like a lens, creating an image. But unlike conventional
<br>
lenses, which can't focus evanescent waves, the image is perfect—so
<br>
Pendry has coined the term superlenses to describe his slabs of
<br>
left-handed material. Of course, to catch the evanescent waves the lens
<br>
has to be placed a lot less than a wavelength from the source. For
<br>
visible light, that would be within a few tens of nanometres. This could
<br>
be a challenge, says Pendry, but it is already possible to position
<br>
objects with this kind of precision using atomic force microscopy, for
<br>
example. And if you work with radio waves, the near field stretches for
<br>
many centimetres, so the tolerances for positioning are more forgiving.
<br>
<p>Strange materials like those made by Smith should work as superlenses
<br>
for microwaves and radio waves. In fact, Smith and a team from UCSD have
<br>
just created the first superlens with a negative refractive index for
<br>
microwaves. But Pendry reckons that a much more common material should
<br>
do the same for visible light. Metals such as silver exhibit negative
<br>
permittivity at the frequency of visible light, but have a positive
<br>
permeability. However, Pendry calculates that for evanescent waves the
<br>
permeability can be ignored. It turns out that a slab of silver just 40
<br>
nanometres thick placed 20 nanometres from the source should act as a
<br>
superlens (New Scientist, 28 October 2000, p 22). &quot;The reason we haven't
<br>
seen this before is that nobody has looked,&quot; he says. &quot;We're not sure
<br>
what we can do with it but we have a few ideas.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pendry's other ideas are already finding applications. One of the most
<br>
promising is in the field of magnetic resonance imaging. MRI machines
<br>
work by placing a sample—usually a patient—inside a powerful magnetic
<br>
field. A blast of high-frequency radio waves forces nuclei in water
<br>
molecules to spin in a particular way and to re-emit radio waves at a
<br>
different, characteristic frequency. This signal is used to build a
<br>
computer image that is useful for diagnosing diseases such as cancer.
<br>
However, these machines require powerful superconducting magnets that
<br>
are expensive and bulky. The size of the machine prevents access to the
<br>
patient, so it can't be used to monitor surgery in real time.
<br>
<p>But Pendry's superlenses could change all that. In February, Pendry and
<br>
his colleagues published the results of preliminary work in which they
<br>
tailored the properties of a left-handed material to channel radio
<br>
signals to a detector outside the machine. The team made it by rolling a
<br>
thin sheet of conducting material onto a plastic rod 20 centimetres
<br>
long, giving it a spiral cross section like a Swiss roll, and then
<br>
packing a number of these rods tightly together into a bundle. Instead
<br>
of working like a lens, the material acts like a waveguide carrying
<br>
radio waves from the nuclei in the sample to a detector. The team has
<br>
published an image of a thumb produced in this way. Being able to use
<br>
smaller detectors outside the machine should allow MRI scanners to be
<br>
smaller and cheaper. Eventually superlenses could even focus radio waves
<br>
onto tiny parts of the sample, allowing a much more detailed image to be
<br>
built up by scanning the focused radio waves across a patient, for
<br>
example.
<br>
<p>Eventually, superlenses could also have a dramatic impact on the way
<br>
silicon chips are made. The size of transistors is currently limited by
<br>
the wavelength of light used in photolithography. Since superlenses can
<br>
focus details in a way that doesn't depend on the wavelength of light,
<br>
they magically remove this barrier and could help chip makers to build
<br>
smaller circuits. The amount of information stored on compact discs and
<br>
DVDs is also restricted by the ability of conventional lenses to focus
<br>
light to a small spot. Here, too, superlenses could help.
<br>
<p>They could even improve the way radio antennas work. Radar beams produce
<br>
extra radiation at right angles to the main beam that create noise and
<br>
reduce the radar's efficiency. Pendry believes that superlenses could
<br>
clean up the side lobes and produce a more directed main beam. In
<br>
addition, Ely Yablonovitch at the University of California, Los Angeles,
<br>
is making a left-handed material to help reduce exposure to radiation
<br>
from mobile phones.
<br>
<p>Pendry is convinced that these materials have an exciting future. &quot;I'm
<br>
still at the gawping stage, but people will gradually think of
<br>
applications,&quot; he says optimistically. &quot;They couldn't think what to do
<br>
with lasers when they were first invented—but now look at them.&quot;
