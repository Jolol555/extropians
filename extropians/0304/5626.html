<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have always thought that the basic premise that diversity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;is inherently beneficial is flawed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;There's not conflict here.  Homogeneous environments are, when well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;adapted, more efficient (allowing for requisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;specializations).  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;they are excessively vulnerable to even slight variations in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;environment.  And they provide fertile ground for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;predator, be it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;virus or a meme (or anything else).  So there is a trade off between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;short term and long term benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;      
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Evolution only works to develop improvements by diversity.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That must explain all those lambs that are part of all lion prides these days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Come to think of it, you are absolutely right! I have *never* seen any animal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;group composed of only ONE type of animal. For example, every antelope herd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has a large contingent of tortoises, and every elephant troop I have ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen has at least 10% rhinos and 10% baboons. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You almost have it right.  The eco system won't support a system of all 
<br>
lions.  They'd starve to death.  Likewise, the grazers depend on the 
<br>
plants, and the plants depend on the bacteria.  Perhaps there are 
<br>
self-sufficient bacteria. 
<br>
<p>Likewise, a field in monoculture, say all wheat, must be heavily doused 
<br>
with poisons of various sorts to keep out the predators (mainly fungi) 
<br>
and fenced to keep out the grazers, etc.  But many diverse systems 
<br>
(meadows, forests, jungles, etc.) are quasi-stable, and tend to bend 
<br>
gracefully to environmental perturbations. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Capitalism only develops better products by diversity.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How true. I have never seen a firm improve its competitive position by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;focusing on just one product.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think the quote tags have gotten confused, however:
<br>
When a monopoly exists in an area, innovation tends to die.  They act to 
<br>
surpress anything that will raise their costs, such as a requirement to 
<br>
design a new product.  This is to the short term benefit of the monopoly 
<br>
and the to long term detriment of their customers.  Eventually they 
<br>
raise their prices so high that their customers rebel, or they 
<br>
experience an intrusion from outside their sphere of control (e.g., 
<br>
Toyota), and the monopoly collapses.  This is frequently a quite 
<br>
expensive process, and not infrequently destroys the original company.
