<em>&gt;&gt;Is patriotism love of one's country, or love of one's country's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;government?  It makes a big difference.  Then there's the distinction 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;representation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What your patriotism identifies as one's focus of love makes a large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes it does.  In an analogy between persons, do you love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your son, or do you love the ideal image of your son?

<em>&gt;&gt;I deeply love the principles this country was founded on.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;deeply abhor the cancerous growth that dares to posture as the

<em>&gt; I'm sorry, but it's not the same thing to &quot;love&quot; the various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-minded principles that have been enunciated from time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time in history.  I presume that you love the Declaration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Rights of Man, or even, if you were to objectively read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, the Soviet Constitution of the former U.S.S.R.  Like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founding documents of the United States, all these put forth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great principles I'm sure you would love.
</em><br>
<p>A country is only as good as its guiding prinicples.  I don't 
<br>
love the country just because I happen to be in it.  The USSR 
<br>
constitution does not speak of government being strictly the 
<br>
servant of the people to guarantee their inalienable rights. 
<br>
That makes all the difference in the world - a difference that 
<br>
most Americans seem to have forgot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Patriotism, or love of country, is not the same thing at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Either you have a deep emotional bond to an actual nation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its people, or you do not.  Perhaps only a small majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the members of most Western nations today have such a loyalty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If that is all patriotism is then it is worthless.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Here, to further remind you of what patriotism consists, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Pledge of Allegiance, exactly as I had to recite it on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first day of school in September 1953:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    States of America, and to the republic for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    which it stands, one nation indivisible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    liberty and justice for all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The republic for which it stands is precisely what I was 
<br>
speaking of.  It is not the same thing as this physical country. 
<br>
Neither is liberty and justice for all.  All of these are 
<br>
concepts, not matters of geography.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; American patriots are those individuals who can read these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, and agree with every nuance of sentiment they contain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and who indeed are themselves allied with that republic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes.  And that does not preclude utter contempt for the 
<br>
government that is shredding the meaning of these words every day.
