Hey Ron!
<br>
<p>I started one of my many dead-end threads on this company a few weeks ago after buying a Discover mag at the newstand. With regard to the technology of thermal depolymerization, I first discovered it as being mentioned as a soon to be affordable, technology that was promoted by Admiral Poindexter, in a 2002 Wall Street Journal article. What makes this technology an improvement over old depolymerization methods, is the rapid hydration under pressure, of the molecules, to break down the material, in oil, gas, or usable chem solids. Older technologies focuses on de-hydration instead. I am guessing that this is a improved version of very old technology, that are now making incremental improvements, and thus, entering a new epoch of financial maketability.
<br>
<p>Caveat: It could also be an exaggeration, and clever gimickry to sell stock to Joe Public.  Having said that, I will not listen to anyone on this list, or any other list, who merely gainsay's this company, or dismisses it, if they are not a chemist or chemical engineer. The reason being is that there are so many pompous schmucks who cling to newgroups and lists,(Google)that in this case, what is needed is testing to see if the technology is as effective as claimed. If I wanted uninformed opinion regarding this chemical process, I just listen to myself.
<br>
<p>My guess is that since it is funded by the Gas Research Institute, the technology is surely viable. Now we merely have to address economics. Here, also, circulum vitae's are necessary, rather then bovine opinion. Moo!

<p>&lt;&lt;Guys,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems unbelieveable.  Comments anyone?
