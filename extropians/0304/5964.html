<p>It seems basically plausible... sort of.  I envision the group he is 
<br>
calling neo-cons as being more similar to the Black Dragon Society, 
<br>
though.  Granted there are large differences, still, I see them as 
<br>
basically militarists who have seen the retreat of the USSR as an 
<br>
opportunity to cast a net of military power over all the &quot;lesser 
<br>
nations&quot; that it finds useful.  I'm afraid that I can't take their talk 
<br>
of &quot;extending democracy&quot; very seriously.  I notice in today's news that 
<br>
the Afghan government is near collapse again after the wonderful 
<br>
&quot;reconstruction&quot; that they received.  I don't imagine that Iraq will 
<br>
fare any better.  It would be nice to be disappointed... but.
<br>
I a survey, I predicted that the war would be over in months.  What I 
<br>
meant by that was that I expected that the US military presence would 
<br>
have withdrawn to selected strategic areas (say, near the oil fields) 
<br>
and that the government that we had installed would be left to sink or 
<br>
swim.  It wouldn't surprise me if the government were officially 
<br>
democratic, as long as the elected the candidates that we choose.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the &quot;neo-cons&quot; have more in common with Teddy Rooseveldt in his 
<br>
more militaristic moods, but they don't actually seem that &quot;liberal&quot;.  
<br>
And nowhere near as libertarian.  So I think of them as more like the 
<br>
Black Dragon Society (but coming from a relatively strong country rather 
<br>
than from a relatively weak one).
