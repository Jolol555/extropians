Here's something for the Bay Area types, of which I know there are a few on
<br>
both lists:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/sfo/eby/sci/9921637.html">http://www.craigslist.org/sfo/eby/sci/9921637.html</a>
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>Our Background:
<br>
We are a national production company based in Emeryville that is producing a
<br>
pilot for Discovery's Science Channel. This high-energy show pits two rival
<br>
scientists in a head to head battle of ideas. It's hard science with an
<br>
edge.
<br>
<p>Your Qualifications:
<br>
You're in your late twenties or early thirties, have at least a masters
<br>
degree in a hard science, and enjoy rapid-fire debate. We want people who
<br>
can defend extreme posititions from opposite poles. Though you will receive
<br>
a small stipend for your time, we are looking for people who are excited
<br>
about being on television and love to argue about science. Do you have a
<br>
knack for metaphor? Are you familiar with popular culture? Iconoclasts,
<br>
class clowns, and mavericks are welcome.
<br>
<p>Possible Subject Areas:
<br>
We are currently considering the topic of &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; but are open
<br>
to other ideas. Keep in mind that we want to avoid ethical or political
<br>
debates in favor of science vs. science. Some other examples of topics
<br>
include: Where did the universe come from? Does the ozone layer matter? or
<br>
What ever happened to the dinosaurs? Scientific disciplines could range from
<br>
Physics to Biology to Geology...and beyond.
<br>
<p>When:
<br>
The one-day shoot will occur in the Bay Area in early May.
<br>
<p>How to Apply:
<br>
To be considered, email a picture, a short bio and a description of the hard
<br>
science topics you are prepared to debate. Do you know a potential opponent?
<br>
Great! Get them to apply too, and they could become your verbal sparring
<br>
partner. Please respond ASAP. Thanks.
