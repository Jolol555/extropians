<p>Excellent question. I suppose you're right that ocean fish were not readily
<br>
accessible to prehistoric humans who lived inland, at least not in
<br>
comparison to fresh-water fish. Perhaps it would have been better for me to
<br>
have stated simply that fish in general are excellent foods, and that it
<br>
turns out that cold-water fatty ocean fish are especially rich in omega-3
<br>
fatty acids, which are among the nutrients in which we are typically most
<br>
deficient.
<br>
<p>It is the *ratio* of omega-3 to omega-6 oils that is of most concern in the
<br>
typical American diet, more so than the absolute amounts of either. Relative
<br>
to our paleolithic ancestors we tend to over-consume omega-6 relative to
<br>
omega-3. This imbalance happened in part as a result of the wide-spread use
<br>
of various high omega-6 vegetable oils used in cooking, and in part because
<br>
modern farm-fed animal food sources are raised on high omega-6 diets. For
<br>
example the way-too-fatty farm-fed beef that you buy in your local
<br>
supermarket is raised mostly on corn, a non-paleolithic high omega-6 grain. 
<br>
<p>Another factor leading to this imbalance is that modern humans no longer eat
<br>
the high omega-3 brains and bone marrow of their prey. (In another thread
<br>
someone has advocated an interesting mate-selection theory as to why the
<br>
human brain has grown so large, but according to paleodiet theory it
<br>
happened at least in part because our paleolithic ancestors consumed a diet
<br>
rich in DHA from animal brains and marrow. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid
<br>
integral to brain development.)
<br>
<p>The omega-3 from cold-water ocean fish helps to offset the modern imbalance
<br>
of omega-3 and omega-6.
