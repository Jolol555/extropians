<em>&gt; There is evidence that hominids were eating large game meat as far back as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *2 million* years ago, though at the time we were scavengers rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say that the evidence indicates that early humans and pre-humans
<br>
didn't eat any meat at all. I said the evidence indicates that they didn't
<br>
get a large % of their calories from meat.  If you would be willing to cite
<br>
research that shows otherwise, I'd be very interested to see it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you'll forgive me for saying so, your argument that Paleolithic diets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not largely animal-based (which I define as 30% to 50% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calories) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outdated. It's the last bastion of vegetarians and their kin who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still cling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the old argument that we were living in trees and eating oranges and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bananas until about 50,000 years ago.
</em><br>
<p>There's no need to beg forgiveness. I'm not emotionally attached to either
<br>
view. But I do find it difficult to believe that early humans with no
<br>
hunting gear more sophisticated than the spear could have gotten a large %
<br>
of calories from meat. I base this in part on first-hand experience hunting
<br>
and on written accounts of hunting in North America in the 1800's when game
<br>
was more plentiful than it is now and when people had guns. Even then, there
<br>
apparently were plenty of days when people went out to hunt and came home
<br>
with no meat.
