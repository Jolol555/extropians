</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  I don't know why this is not obvious to everyone.  While Saddam
<br>
was in power, only his supporters showed public support while opposition was
<br>
quiet.  Now that the American soldiers are in power, only their supporters
<br>
showed public support while the opposition was quiet.  It is the same
<br>
situation in both sides.  All it proves to me is that people are like sheep
<br>
and will follow their masters in power in most cases.
<br>
<p>The real test will be whether their is peaceful society during the next few
<br>
months or if we have riots, terrorist attacks and demonstrations against
<br>
America.  They no longer have a government suppressing pro-America support,
<br>
and have American troops their actively encouraging in, so it will hard to
<br>
explain away as faked propaganda.
<br>
<p>Anti-American sentiment may grow instead of decreasing, and will probably be
<br>
based on immediate living conditions instead of long-term political views.
<br>
Remember that times got tougher in Russia after communism fell, and many in
<br>
the public sector rebelled against capitalism at first, claiming it made
<br>
things worse.  I think the near-term living conditions in Iraq will be rough
<br>
for a while under the occupation.  The occupying power will not be as
<br>
proficient at running the country as they were at warring with it.  The
<br>
populace will rebel and complain how things actually got worse under U.S.
<br>
rule than under the previous regime.  If this happens, it will be based on
<br>
the personal lifestyle of individuals and not based on political theories
<br>
about freedom or rights.  People quickly forget about their rights when they
<br>
want food, water or a job.  Immediate needs take precedence and will shape
<br>
public opinion.
<br>
<p>America quickly took over the oil wells and are keeping them going.  Soon we
<br>
will be shipping oil to America.  If we don't immediately take over public
<br>
utilities, food production, and the economic situation, and keep these going
<br>
as well, I predict there will be a backlash.  It will appear (rightly or
<br>
wrongly) that we only maintained the needs of America but neglected the
<br>
needs of the Iraqi people.  Careful handling with delicate PR is necessary
<br>
at this stage, and it is extremely easy to blow it.
