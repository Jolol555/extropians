<em>&gt;&gt; You might be surprised at how much weight you can lose by simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; eliminating agricultural and dairy products, without regard for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anything else. The former is basically empty calories and the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is, as above, mostly saturated fat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to be ignoring nutrients.  Minerals and vitamins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dairy has calcium, grains I believe have various B vitamins
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a *lot* of fiber... 
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm not ignoring vitamins and minerals. Take calcium for example. The
<br>
dairy industry has done a fine job of brain-washing us to believe we need
<br>
dairy for calcium, but if that is so then how do we explain the fact that
<br>
prehistoric humans had no dairy products but were taller than us moderns,
<br>
with bigger and stronger bones? The truth is that vegetables, especially
<br>
green leafy vegetables like spinach, contain more than enough calcium. AND
<br>
they contain the B vitamins and fiber that you also mention, along with a
<br>
plethora of other valuable vitamins and antioxidants and phytonutrients.
<br>
<p>Rickets was a major national health problem here in US in the early part of
<br>
this century because Americans were so heavily dependent on agricultural
<br>
products. Rather than steer us away from agricultural products, (and
<br>
agribusiness, upon which our economy relies so heavily), the US government
<br>
decided instead to mandate that flour be fortified with B vitamins. 
<br>
<p>In itself flour is little more than sugar. It is broken down into sugar
<br>
before it is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; A book on Australia I just read noted the aborigines trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millstones to grind grass seeds in the dry areas.  I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure excluding grains is completely paleolithic. 
</em><br>
<p>I would say those aborigines are better described a Neolithic rather than
<br>
Paleolithic.
