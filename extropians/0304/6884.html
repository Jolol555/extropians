<em>&gt; Yes, farming animals.  Jared Diamond disagrees with you.  Living at

</em><br>
<p>The problem isn't living in close quarters with your animals. If this
<br>
were so, dog, cat, parrot, and other species' diseases would be quite
<br>
common among people. You can't get leukemia from infected cats, for
<br>
example, or distemper from your dog. If this were the case, then the
<br>
US, which has the highest incidence of pets in the home, would be the
<br>
world capital of epidemic disease. It isn't.
<br>
<p>The problem with diseases crossing the species boundary is specifically
<br>
a problem of poor food preparation sanitation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and there's good old E. coli and salmonella, 
</em><br>
<p>And e coli and salmonella are specifically caused by poor food prep
<br>
sanitation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As for the increase in sedentary living in the Neolithic, yes I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; By sedentary I meant &quot;poor sanitation&quot;, made even worse with the

<br>
While that might be an interesting theory, that they died out because
<br>
of their own filthy habits, the primary cause of poor sanitation has
<br>
been the development of organized agriculture and centralized
<br>
communities to support it. This was caused by a shift away from nomadic
<br>
herding toward stationary cultivation of vegan lifestyles.
<br>
<p>The primary cause of reductions in epidemic disease has been
<br>
sanitation, specifically food preparation sanitation, in regards to
<br>
water purity, sterilization of food implements, and sterilization of
<br>
food parasites.
