<p>
spike,
<br>
<p>A few days ago I posted a message here about the conversation I had with my
<br>
girlfriend about your bulbous head theory (the interesting theory that 1)
<br>
modern mate selection in humans is driven mostly by females, and that 2)
<br>
women are attracted to men with large heads because their babies have large
<br>
heads, and that 3) this has caused the evolution of larger heads and larger
<br>
brains.)
<br>
<p>I have a fairly large head but my girlfriend as you'll recall thought the
<br>
theory was pretty funny, and remarked that she's attracted to me instead for
<br>
my &quot;pimp juice&quot; (whatever that might be). She listens to a Hip Hop station
<br>
on her car radio and, just as I suspected, that is where she picked up the
<br>
term &quot;pimp juice.&quot; 
<br>
<p>So what is pimp juice? 
<br>
<p>I didn't know and no one here in this thread offered an answer. However my
<br>
friend Jacques from France was intrigued and during an offlist discussion of
<br>
diet and nutrition he took some time to investigate this question for me
<br>
(his email message to me is below, which he wanted me to post onlist with
<br>
his full name and email address, desiring full credit for his excellent
<br>
detective work in discovering the true meaning of this most elusive term). 
<br>
<p>It turns out that pimp juice is a song by a rapper named &quot;Nelly.&quot; A
<br>
journalist asked Nelly for his definition of pimp juice (Jacques provides
<br>
the link below).  Mr. Nelly explained:
<br>
<p>&quot;'Pimp Juice' is anything that attracts the opposite sex. It could be money,
<br>
fame or straight intellect. Whatever you use to get ahead at whatever you're
<br>
doing, that's your 'pimp juice.'&quot;
<br>
<p>So now we know. And I think Nelly is right; pimp juice is &quot;whatever you use
<br>
to get ahead at whatever you're doing.&quot; I agree also with you, spike, that
<br>
mate-selection is mostly female-driven in modern humans. I think pimp juice
<br>
is just exactly what women seek in men. 
<br>
<p>We'd likely still be living in caves if it weren't for the female thirst for
<br>
pimp juice. :)

<em>&gt; &gt; gts a écrit (16.4.2003/18:55) :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes. Basically my skin tone and color improved and I felt stronger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and better. I think my skin color improved because I had been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; eating too few fruits and vegetables before I switched diets. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Suddenly my cheeks were rosy and healthy looking, after looking a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; bit drab during the previous year or two on the Atkins diet. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; paleodiet also seemed to help me think more clearly, but again this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; might be because I was transitioning from an extremely-low-carb 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Atkins ketogenic diet, which probably muddied my brain cells a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Okay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way you pretend to know English very well. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, let me pretend some more, to thank you for your nutrition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you know a pimp is an agent for prostitutes, and juice is slang 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for money. That's for the literal meaning. Now as you can read at &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.poserman.com/news/templates/music.asp?articleid=87&amp;zoneid=5">http://www.poserman.com/news/templates/music.asp?articleid=87&amp;zoneid=5</a></em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rapper named Nelly has a single named &quot;Pimp Juice&quot; and he explains 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the journalist the meaning of the phrase (which seems to imply that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he coined it, or at least that it is a recent creation in his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subculture):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Nelly explains that, &quot;'Pimp Juice' is anything that attracts the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     opposite sex. It could be money, fame or straight intellect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Whatever you use to get ahead at whatever you're doing, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     your 'pimp juice.'&quot;
