<p>I would generally agree Harvey, but recall my notes from several months
<br>
ago determining that I was probably deficient in Omega-3's.  I'm trying
<br>
to compensate now by consuming Omega-3 supplements as well as consuming
<br>
a Salmon(Lox) bagel or sushi (with tuna) once or twice a week.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned -- I don't think it is &quot;high fat&quot; or &quot;high cholesterol&quot;
<br>
per se that is dangerous but the oxidized forms that may be problematic.
<br>
In particular the macrophages have a receptor for oxidized low density
<br>
lipoproteins [1].  In our current genetic program it may simply be easy
<br>
to trigger the process where macrophages become activated by oxidized
<br>
LDL, become foam cells, turn into plaques (e.g. the entire process of
<br>
atherosclerosis).  I'm reasonably sure there are studies showing that
<br>
Vitamin E/C can reduce/prevent this.
<br>
<p>So Vits. E/C may be able to compensate for processes leading to heart
<br>
disease.  In contrast, if one wants to prevent the DNA mutations that
<br>
lead to cancer, then its looking like alpha-lipoic acid and estrogen
<br>
may be the best bets right now.  Co-Q10 which was highly thought of
<br>
a few years ago may have a good-side/bad-side that is probably
<br>
wrapped up extensively with other aspects of ones diet.
<br>
<p>Though it probably isn't a good idea to go overboard on fats, I think
<br>
one can compensate for higher than average levels with vitamin supplements.
