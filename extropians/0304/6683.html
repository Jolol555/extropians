<p><em>&gt; Hmm.  I wonder if Neolithic declines in health might come less from

</em><br>
<p>Concerning (a): if you're measuring food in calories, then it looks pretty
<br>
apparent to me that early Neolithic peoples consumed on average at least as
<br>
much if not more calories than late Paleolithic peoples. I say this because
<br>
the evidence is that early Neolithic peoples were more prone to diseases
<br>
like diabetes, which suggests at least excessive calories from
<br>
carbohydrates.
<br>
<p>Concerning (b): I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;living with animals.&quot; Are you
<br>
referring to the domestication of cats and dogs? I don't think the
<br>
domestication of cats and dogs led to any significant increase in disease or
<br>
mortality. Probably just the opposite. If you are referring to the farming
<br>
of animals then I also think it did not in itself lead to any significant
<br>
increase in disease or mortality, at least not from infectious disease.
<br>
<p>As for the increase in sedentary living in the Neolithic, yes I agree: I
<br>
think that's a given. But I hasten to add that this is only my own opinion.
<br>
I know some reputable paleodiet theorists who believe paleolithic males were
<br>
more sedentary than modern males, though they generally don't think the same
<br>
was true for paleolithic females. They believe late paleolithic males
<br>
basically just sat on their asses much of the time, telling jokes and
<br>
stories to one another, and that they needed only to hunt occasionally to
<br>
provide their women and children with animal foods. I disagree with them,
<br>
but admittedly there are some studies of modern HG cultures that seem to
<br>
give their arguments some credence.
