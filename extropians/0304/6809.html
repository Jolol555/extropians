<p><em>&gt; It seems to be claiming that if you cut out 1 1/2 amino acids of the normal

</em><br>
<p>If you dig really deep into the literature (and I mean *really* deep)
<br>
you will find that restriction of some of the essential amino acids
<br>
(i.e. those that cannot be synthesized) cause an up-regulation of
<br>
protein recycling.  As I recall there are multiple pathways that
<br>
may be involved (which makes sense from a biochemical standpoint).
<br>
The effect may also have some species specificity because I doubt
<br>
that species are likely to encounter the same amino acid shortages
<br>
given the variety of diets (of say mice/rats vs. humans).
<br>
<p>The working hypothesis that others (and I) have had is that if
<br>
you increase protein recycling one gets a greater ratio of
<br>
&quot;new&quot; proteins vs. &quot;old&quot; proteins.  The new proteins are less
<br>
damaged than the old proteins (from say oxidative or deamidation
<br>
damage) and thus function more reliably/efficiently.  An increase in
<br>
the protein turnover rate may also cause proteins to be broken
<br>
down before they accumulate sufficient damage that the normal
<br>
recycling mechanisms will not work and they end up accumulating
<br>
as lipofuscin.
<br>
<p>For more information you want to do a PubMed search on
<br>
&quot;Cuervo AM&quot; and/or &quot;Dice JF&quot;.
<br>
<p>Its also starting to become clear that there are &quot;molecular clocks&quot;
<br>
that determine the protein recycling rate -- see:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.deamidation.org/">http://www.deamidation.org/</a>
<br>
<p>It seems highly unlikely (at least to me) that the clock timings are
<br>
setup optimally to recycle proteins as the protein recycling
<br>
machinery becomes less efficient due to it being blocked by
<br>
materials it is less able to recycle (e.g. lipofuscin).
<br>
This would be a classic case of antagonistic pleiotropy --
<br>
i.e. you don't want to recycle proteins too fast at a young
<br>
age because it wastes energy but when you get older and the
<br>
recycling machinery is less efficient the timings are too
<br>
slow to maintain the majority of proteins in an optimal state.
<br>
<p>Is this &quot;common knowledge&quot; within the aging research community?
<br>
I can only state that I was at a lecture by Steve Austad, who
<br>
I consider to be a leading aging researcher, last week and asked
<br>
him whether he was aware of the molecular clock data.
<br>
The answer was &quot;No&quot;.
<br>
<p>I suppose that is one reason why one asks the ExI list...
