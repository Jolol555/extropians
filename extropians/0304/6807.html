<p>
I saw a PBS program on folk music, which was very good.
<br>
A cat named Barry McGuire did a song called Eve of
<br>
Destruction, which was kinda catchy but with a terribly
<br>
negative outlook.  Written nearly 40 years ago, it was
<br>
about the middle east exploding, nuclear weapons dooming
<br>
us all, basically about the whole world falling into a
<br>
morass from which extrication is impossible.  Well, I
<br>
do not share that view.  So I rewrote the words a bit
<br>
to modernize the song.  It has the same tune and meter
<br>
as before, for those of you who know the 1964 version,
<br>
and it goes like this, in the key of B:
<br>
<p>Eve of Construction
<br>
<p>The modern World
<br>
It is explodin'
<br>
Technology ragin'
<br>
Our children codin'
<br>
The tyrannized people
<br>
Will soon be votin'
<br>
You don't believe in tech
<br>
But what's that computer you're totin'
<br>
And pretty soon we'll have
<br>
our brains uploadin'
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<p>But you tell me over, and over, and over again my friend
<br>
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<p>Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
<br>
Can't you feel the optimism I'm feelin' today
<br>
If Eliezer is right, there's no need runnin' away
<br>
The Singularity will save
<br>
We've dug our last grave
<br>
When we knock out the aging gene
<br>
It'll be the immortal scene
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<p>And you tell me over, and over, and over again my friend
<br>
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<p>The concept's so rad
<br>
It's better than copulatin'
<br>
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'
<br>
I can't twist the truth
<br>
It knows no regulation
<br>
Handful of senators can't pass legislation
<br>
Luddite marches alone can't bring frustration,
<br>
When human respect is integratin'
<br>
This future world
<br>
Is just awaitin'
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<p>And you tell me over, and over, and over again my friend
<br>
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<p>And think of all the talent there is in Red China
<br>
All the money to be made in Taxifornia
<br>
Ah you may leave here for four months in space
<br>
And when you return it's a different place
<br>
Ragin' science and technology
<br>
The pride of the human race,
<br>
You can now freeze your dead with no tears on your face
<br>
With nanotech coming, the future holds them a place.
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<p>But you tell me over, and over, and over, and over again my friend
<br>
You don't believe we're on the eve of construction
<br>
No, no, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
<br>
