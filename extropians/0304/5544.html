<em>&gt;&gt; The most aggravating thing about FOX is not that it's biased; it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that it bills itself as unbiased when it is clearly the most biased 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; news network. O'Reilly is only part of the problem there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; On a scale of -10 to +10, where -10 is totally biased to the left, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and +10 is totally biased to the right, I place CNN at about a -3, 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>An offlist BCC'd friend replied:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...I'd place CNN at -8 and FOX at +1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm only giving CNN a -8 based on recent war coverage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During the Clinton years, the network varied from -8 to -10, IMO.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their election coverage was not credible.  One could see the tears in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reporters' eyes when it appeared Gore lost.
</em><br>
<p>This goes to the point that I made earlier and to which you objected: I made
<br>
the argument that FOX is a purely commercial phenomenon designed to grab
<br>
share from the generally liberal media, and that the laws of economics
<br>
suggest that another more even-keeled network will take share back from FOX.
<br>
CNN itself may be that network. It has been argued by one well known
<br>
national media watcher (I don't recall his name at the moment, but an
<br>
article by him appeared recently in my local newspaper) that CNN has
<br>
recently taken a strong turn to the right and center to take some share back
<br>
from the ultra right-wing FOX. I agree with that observation.
