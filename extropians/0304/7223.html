In some ultimate sense, I expect expansion may be both inward and outward in some form of space-filling configuration, but I suspect that by then the rules may have changed in ways we can can't imagine. On a nearer (post-singularity, or similar) time-scale, I think the vastness of space will continue to cause us to focus more of our attention and resources locally and inwardly, where I think we will find virtual universes to explore.
<br>
<p>Most of our speculation about the distant future is so constrained by our cognitive limitations, and so guided by our animal nature, both of which are short term, that all I feel sure of is that it's wildly inaccurate.
<br>
<p>Regarding the question of whether there is a limit to complexity, I'm not qualified to debate the current theories.  I am intrigued by the way systems in general tend to use energy to increase local complexity, and what this might mean to humans in the sense of the universe playing a non-zero sum game.

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So you believe there is no limit to complexity? If there is a limit to complexity, as we face our own limits in each epoch, it would seem that moving across physical space, is more feasible, then some internal paradise, forever isolated, forever recombining matter into ever more complex mind materials. We live in an epoch where its easier to make advances in computing, then it is to send probes and people into space. Will this coefficient always be this way? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jef opined:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Also, in contrast to those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;who feel that advanced civilizations will continue to expand to take over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ever increasing volumes of physical space, I suspect there's very little to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;be gained by moving a lot of mass around, and that advanced civilizations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;will tend to grow in complexity in ways that we are unlikely to be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;observe. I agree with Greg that detecting an extraterrestrial civilization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is very unlikely due to the relatively short blip during which they would be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;emitting detectable signals.
