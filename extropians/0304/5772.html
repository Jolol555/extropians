<em>&gt; Yes, but the point is that some people argue that the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identities of their atoms *are* important, and that they'd have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no objection to teleportation if they didn't have this lingering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling that &quot;their&quot; original atoms were back in the previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleporter pod reduced to piles of elements.
</em><br>
<p>Can you point out any examples of this argument or person?  I can't see even
<br>
religious people believing in a soul caring about which atoms are used.  I
<br>
think this is a false assumption about people who don't think copies
<br>
preserve identity.  There also is a third belief (held by me) that both
<br>
copies preserve identity, but that neither should be destroyed.
<br>
<p>I think we are wasting time discussing whether individual atoms are
<br>
important until we actually find someone who holds this belief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More to the point, there exist some concepts of self, for example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts that would survive extremely rapid evolution, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think are just incorrect concepts.  Some people, who I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referred to as &quot;radical uploaders&quot;, e.g. Ralph Merkle, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not mind evolving one second from now into creatures so advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they would resemble us no more than we resemble the fetuses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from which we grew.  If that happened to me, I contend, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be dead as soon as it happened.
</em><br>
<p>I fall into this category.  I don't care how fast I change, as long as I can
<br>
comprehend and process the changes as they occur.  If I had a very fast
<br>
Jupiter brain, it would seem to me that each change is a minor adjustment.
<br>
I would live through all the changes as they occur and continue to recognize
<br>
myself as me no matter how radical I become.
<br>
<p>This prompts me to make a completing list of levels for teleportation.  I
<br>
believe the question boils down to what is being persevered.  Therefore I
<br>
would guess that the following types of preferences would exist:
<br>
<p>1.  Preserve the same atoms.  Break them apart and reassemble elsewhere.
<br>
2.  Preserve the same pattern.  Break them apart and reassemble different
<br>
atoms elsewhere.
<br>
3.  Preserve the same appearance.  A similar looking body or simulation
<br>
replaced the original.
<br>
4.  Preserve the same continuity of body.  Add and subtract small pieces
<br>
repeatedly until the result is achieved.
<br>
5.  Preserve the same continuity of mind.  Keep the conscious thinking
<br>
process running with no interruption.
<br>
6.  Preserve the same external functionality.  This would be the Turing test
<br>
on a simulation.   If other people can't tell the difference, it is good
<br>
enough.
<br>
7.  Preserve the same information.  Copy every atom or every neuron or every
<br>
thought onto a static substrate, like a book or CD, and it is good enough.
<br>
<p>These are not levels, but separate choices to preserve different aspects of
<br>
ourselves.  My choice is 5.  I do not know how to do this without also
<br>
having choice 4 at the same time.  I do not know how to transfer mind
<br>
without a physical connection to the body.  I do not know how to &quot;move&quot; the
<br>
mind without doing a destructive copy.
<br>
<p>The perfect scenario for me would be to graft a computer to my brain and
<br>
replace each neuron's function with the computer one at a time until the
<br>
whole brain function is transferred to the computer.  Although this destroys
<br>
each neuron, the whole mind function is not disrupted and clearly ends up
<br>
running inside the computer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because I've always intuited that my duplicate and I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree on all matters (seeing quite eye to eye), I have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed that a sensible person would be unable to work all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this out with his duplicate.  Moreover, I claim that one should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have an extremely good feeling about the fact that one has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicate, because whatever it is that you value in being alive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all, according to physics you have twice as much to value.
</em><br>
<p>This is my view.  The duplicate has value.  Destroying either one of the
<br>
copies diminishes my presence in the universe by some amount.
