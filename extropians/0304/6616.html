<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ### People living on minimum wages do not pay direct taxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't have any direct experience, but I seem to remember that anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; earning more than $750 a year had to pay income tax.  And I know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in college when I was working for $5.00 per hour for short hours I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still had income tax withheld, even though my projected yearly income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have been *far* below poverty.  (I wasn't a full time job.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But there could be some special rule about people earning minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wage that I never encountered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My inclination, however, is to doubt your assertion.  Do you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular knowledge indicating that it is true, or is it just &quot;it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't seem reasonable&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; OTOH, I haven't read that section of the tax manual for many decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (I assume that you could tell by the $750.  That's *got* to be out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; date!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Oops, I guess I screwed up here to some extent. Apparently even at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum wage level it is possible to pay some taxes, although the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amounts, both as a percentage and absolute numbers, are tiny, and the amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received in entitlements and the use of public goods received by the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vastly exceeds their contribution to the economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, this was only a side remark, not particularly relevant to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of whether minimum wage laws are an efficient method of subsidizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the poor.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>gee, I really hate to drag cold numbers into your little conversation, but I 
<br>
just cannot resist:
<br>
<p>--A single male working at ~ min wage == ~ $6/hr =~ 12k/yr;
<br>
<p>--from the USA tax table --&gt; standard deduction == 7.7K;
<br>
<p><p>-- so taxable income ==~5K 
<br>
and from the tax table, that person would owe about $500 in income taxes 
<br>
taxes. Plus about 8% goes to Social Security and medicare ==~ 12K (.08) == 
<br>
$1000.
<br>
So he now has a take home of 12K-1.5K == 10.5K, or about $800/month.
<br>
<p><p>let's see how it looks to the single male getting 12K/yr.
<br>
An apartment here in Houston costs about $400, and that is distinctly low-
<br>
end. == $5000/yr, counting deposit, etc.
<br>
<p>That leaves 5.5K;
<br>
<p>Electricity =~ $40/mon ==~ $500;
<br>
-leaves 5K;
<br>
<p>Phone =~ $300/yr.
<br>
leaves ~ 4.4K
<br>
<p>Food =~ $/day (rice,beans, oatmeal, etc) =~ $1500/yr;
<br>
<p>leaves ~ 3K.
<br>
<p>transportation: car payment = 200/month for a used car, insurance == 100/mon
<br>
totals ...hmmm ~ 4K with registration taxes etc...
<br>
<p>So, no transportation unless he lives near a bus line, which drives the cost 
<br>
of the apartment up to $500/month.
<br>
<p>So what is left? Maybe 2K for &quot;emergencies&quot; such as medical care.
<br>
<p>Now THAT is the way to keep the poor boys down. That way it is harder for 
<br>
them to pass on their genes, and *our* successful genes will have a better 
<br>
chance of survival and being passed on.  
<br>
<p>Well, maybe *that* part is not covered all that well in the tax tables, etc. 
<br>
But isn't that what life as a social animal is all about: once the successful 
<br>
animals reach a position of power, they use that power to hamper reproduction 
<br>
by the less successful animals in the society....
<br>
<p>So therefore we gotta take that 1.5K in taxes away from the poor boys (Here 
<br>
in the USA, women are able to get welfare, BTW; men are not unless disabled). 
<br>
Otherwise they might use that 1.5K to get a flashy bower, err....car, and 
<br>
thereby compete with us for women's attention, and thus weaken our chances 
<br>
for genetic dominance....and we just can't have that....
<br>
<p>Now, for someone like me or you, lets see:
<br>
suppose I make 55K, which gives me 47K taxable, and I pay 9K fed tax + 4K SS 
<br>
tax. That leaves me with &gt; 30K left over, and suppose I spend 10K on my 
<br>
condo, and food etc.
<br>
<p>That leaves me with 20K to build a great bower....er, get a nice flashy 
<br>
car...I think I will get a big loud stereo and one of those neon license 
<br>
plate holders....the women won't be able to miss me in that thing.  
<br>
<p>GENETIC DOMINANCE, HERE I COME!
