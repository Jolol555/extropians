<p>We definitely have to get past that this is an unworthy way
<br>
of contributing to an economy.  Whatever we may think of some
<br>
occupations, e.g., making a fortune by installing violent
<br>
video games for teenagers, or collecting rents on properties
<br>
one owns, any effort to remold economies into &quot;preferred&quot;
<br>
directions is harmful.  The sad story of what happens when
<br>
property rights are infringed, from Plymouth colony to the
<br>
takings of the 1990's, is well documented in &quot;The Noblest
<br>
Triumph&quot; by Thomas Bethell.
<br>
<p>Administering property, as well as being involved in very 
<br>
abstract and high level economic activity such as securities
<br>
markets, has to be seen as absolutely vital, and is one of
<br>
the main symptoms of what's wrong in developing countries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the people at the bottom can use incentives too, such as the belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their hard work will make them better off.  But someone on minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't need taxes to keep them from barely breaking even
</em><br>
<p>Taxes should be much lower for *everyone*.  The way that they
<br>
wreck the incentives of those at the bottom is not by extracting
<br>
large amounts of money from the poor (as has been discussed), but
<br>
by providing the appearance that the great gobs of money extracted
<br>
from the well to do will be spent on them either in social programs
<br>
now or retirement money in their old age.  This just does not 
<br>
encourage the right behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; tax rules above, we place our entire world on a lower exponential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; growth pattern, with severe consequences (in the long run) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In the long run we are all dead.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Keynesianism, which brought us such novel phenomena as stagflation,
<br>
and has now (one hopes) been completely discredited, perhaps did have
<br>
a tendency to look only at incentives over the life time of a single
<br>
individual, whereas in business and national life a lot really is
<br>
accomplished (amazingly) by much longer term incentives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; possibly not true if a Singularity actually happens, but people are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yeah, but we should not try to form policy based on short-run
<br>
incentives.  The long term horizons of business should be matched
<br>
by long term national policy.
