<em>&gt; &quot;In primitive cultures past and present the most frequent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes of disability and death are infections, nutritional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disturbances, trauma, and obstetrical, neonatal, and early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pediatric problems.&quot;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not a claim about pre vs post agricultural revolution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diets. It is thus not a claim against paleodiet theory, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states that infant mortality and death from many diseases 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were actually greater in the early neolithic than in the late 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paleolithic. 
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.  I have no problem with the notion that early farmers were
<br>
less healthy than late hunter-gatherers.  I consider this idea to be
<br>
well documented and in the mainstream of anthropology.
<br>
<p>My point is that in *all* human cultures prior to the last few
<br>
centuries, the causes of death were very different than the causes of
<br>
death that we see today.
<br>
<p>To be specific, heart disease, cancer, and stroke combined made up
<br>
about 80% of deaths in the US last year.  They likely made up less
<br>
than 10% of deaths in any pre-industrial society.
<br>
<p>Here's what this tells us:  the causes of death we now face have been
<br>
almost &quot;invisible&quot; to evolution until just the past few centuries.
<br>
That's why I'm dubious that an evolutionary perspective can tell you a
<br>
whole lot about what kind of diet is going to best stave off heart
<br>
disease or cancer - because heart disease and cancer were virtually
<br>
non-existent in human populations until very recently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More generally, from some of the posts you've written here, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you may be under the false impression that paleodiet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory prescribes a diet that does not take advantage the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern medicine, (e.g., that one should not take antibiotics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or vitamin supplements). If that is your view of paleodiet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory then it is incorrect. Paleodieters are not Christian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientists. :)
</em><br>
<p>:)  I'm glad to hear that.  My points about antibiotics, etc... have
<br>
not meant to imply that paleo dieters won't avail themselves of modern
<br>
medicine.  Rather, they point out the problem with this kind of
<br>
evolutionary model of what's healthy and not healthy.  Someone on a
<br>
paleo diet who uses antibiotics or vitamin supplements must do so
<br>
*despite* the fact that humans are not &quot;adapted&quot; to such modern
<br>
inventions.  So when does a paleo dieter decide to do what humans are
<br>
adapted for and when do you decided to do something humans are not
<br>
adapted for?  That's the crux of my use of vitamin supplements and
<br>
antibiotics as examples.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
