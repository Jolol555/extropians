Mike Lorrey:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they should be garrison troops, not line troops. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a significant difference between the two.
</em><br>
<p>Just a terminology quibble: when not deployed for war, 'police' actions,
<br>
or training, line troops are 'in garrison'. I'm not sure what you mean
<br>
by 'garrison troops'. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Teaching a combat line marine to be sensitive to what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he should be viewing as the enemy entirely nullifies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his training for combat. You might as well just discharge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him and put him out of his misery.
</em><br>
<p>Not only does a marine in combat have to ID a target before he shoots it
<br>
(if only to say 'it's shooting at me', but often more than that) but he
<br>
has to do it under very stressful conditions. Is it a friendly? A
<br>
neutral? A civilian? And from a political standpoint, he better be
<br>
right. 'Teaching a combat line marine to be sensitive to what he should
<br>
be viewing as the enemy' hardly 'nullifies his training for combat'. In
<br>
fact, it is an essential part of his training for combat. In this age of
<br>
&quot;civilized&quot; warfare, soldiers, marines, and airmen are routinely drilled
<br>
on aircraft/vehicle identification and uniform recognition, and some
<br>
troops training for urban terrain even do the proverbial 'cop-style'
<br>
live-fire with pop-up mommies and kids mixed in with the bad guys. All
<br>
tank crews must pass a test on vehicle ID. Same with A-10 pilots.
<br>
Artillerymen must clear their fire to ensure there are no friendlies or
<br>
civilians or mosques in the area. Anyone who thinks this kind of
<br>
training is a bad idea needs to remember, as Saddam has shown, facing
<br>
off against modern technology in the open is suicide. The Saddams of the
<br>
world want to face modern armies where the odds are more even, in the
<br>
streets, where the kids play, among the mosques and schools. This
<br>
training is perhaps the only way to drill a marine to shoot enemies
<br>
while preserving the lives of innocent people. Does it make him
<br>
hesitate? Yes. Do I want him to hesitate when I'm in the sights? Yes. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Civilians are entirely incapable of having an informed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion about these issues. 
</em><br>
<p>Many civilians have served in the military at one point, and some
<br>
civilians study the issues deeply enough to have an informed opinion. I
<br>
agree it's a challenge for an 18 year old, Semper-Fi, do-or-die trooper
<br>
to preserve the lives of the innocent in a firefight, and within some
<br>
parameters, he is given leeway to do his job the best he can. But a
<br>
professional combat soldier is just that, a professional, and he *can*
<br>
do it reasonably well if given the proper training. It's a learned
<br>
skill, like any other, and the need for it is not going away for the
<br>
foreseeable future.
<br>
