<p>
I have been saying this for several months, but the
<br>
past week of PBS showings provides more confirmation.
<br>
<p>Despite all the attempts to ascribe silly motives -
<br>
revenge for his dad, oil - to the Bush administration,
<br>
the real thread that seems consistent with everything
<br>
they have done and said (keeping in mind the
<br>
statements designed for mass media consumption) is a
<br>
well thought out plan to suck the world into a new
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>The reason for the new system is pretty much as they
<br>
have stated it, but a little more radical.  Basically,
<br>
they accept Conrad Schnieker's hypothesis about the
<br>
exponentially rising curve of cheap weapons of
<br>
annihilation - binary viruses, etc., which Conrad, one
<br>
of the originators of &quot;nanotechnology&quot; as a focused
<br>
movement and theory, stated in the late '70's.  As
<br>
Conrad told me then, the only likely solution that
<br>
will enable a high-tech civilization to survive
<br>
long-term is universal surveillance.  Check out the
<br>
flood of &quot;tranparency&quot;  sites that have recently
<br>
emerged, following Brin's book.  Same idea.  The
<br>
alternative - that there is no solution - resolves
<br>
Fermi's hypothesis.
<br>
<p>The time frame is the problem.  Conrad and I, both
<br>
anarcho-capitalists, agreed that the state would
<br>
ultimately not be able to solve the problem.  &quot;Who
<br>
guards the guards?&quot;  Etc.  Only a competitive system
<br>
centered around the rational costs of risk and risk
<br>
management, involving insurance companies primarilly,
<br>
would be able to properly balance marginal returns to
<br>
optimize such a system long term.  
<br>
<p>However, we are not there.  Our anarcho-capitalist
<br>
utopia is decades off, and the threat of annihilation
<br>
is a bit closer.  Not that Bush and Co. are likely to
<br>
be closet anarcho-capitalists...  So, they use the
<br>
hammer they do have, the U.S. coercive military might.
<br>
<p>However, they're not planning a new Roman empire, as
<br>
far as I can tell.  Instead, they've used Afganistan
<br>
and now Iraq as demonstrations to the world as to
<br>
intent, capability, resolve...  The rest of the world
<br>
can join the winning team or take their chances.
<br>
<p>So, based on the Chronkite hosted Armaggedon series
<br>
and a host of other clearly orchastrated media events,
<br>
here it what to expect:  
<br>
<p>Bush &amp; Co. will manipulate events to suck the majority
<br>
of the important world powers - the so-called &quot;good
<br>
guys,&quot; all more or less democracies or otherwise
<br>
certifiable as &quot;friendly&quot; - into a coalition that will
<br>
back a joint force that will go into any country,
<br>
anywhere, anytime, if it is deemed necessary to clear
<br>
out terrorist camps.  A few more examples may be made
<br>
- N. Korea is waving a red flag with a huge &quot;target me
<br>
now&quot; ideogram etched across, and they may fulfil their
<br>
own prophecy, altho it may be the Chinese, who want
<br>
the world to know that THEY are not irresponsible
<br>
terrorists (even if they are, whenever they think they
<br>
can get away with it) and are macho enough to do their
<br>
part for the new world order, not just wait for the
<br>
U.S. to run everything.
<br>
<p>So it may well go.  The real bad guys like Saddam will
<br>
fall all over themselves to invite the World Police
<br>
(&quot;World Security Forces?&quot; - somebody come up with a
<br>
catchy name here...) inspectors in to verify that THEY
<br>
don't have any terrorists mixing up variants of SARS,
<br>
etc. - if they believe that the alternative is what
<br>
happened to Saddam.
<br>
<p>So, the problem that Conrad identified may actually be
<br>
solved, short term, altho the solution will bring its
<br>
own serious problems.  
<br>
<p>Given that we're not likely to stop this from
<br>
happening if it's in the works, the question becomes
<br>
how to best deal with it and the new problems it will
<br>
introduce.
<br>
<p>Possibilities:
<br>
<p>The &quot;nanocorp&quot; movement is apparently growing like
<br>
wildfire and may quickly become international.  I have
<br>
pushed something similar for decades now, based on the
<br>
&quot;trust,&quot; however, instead of the corporation.  Either
<br>
way, there is and will be a demand for nano-support,
<br>
nano-infrastructure, etc., which could involve easilly
<br>
standardized contracts, such as the universal social
<br>
contract that I have suggested, which could become a
<br>
world-unifying standard, and a grass-roots,
<br>
self-sustaining base from which to oppose the top-down
<br>
corporatization of the world that will try to take
<br>
advantage of this new world order.  Not so much to
<br>
oppose it, however, as to offer solutions not
<br>
available to top-down structures.  
<br>
<p>Eg., the problem that Bush &amp; Co. are faced with now re
<br>
the possibility that &quot;democracy&quot; in Iraq may well mean
<br>
another Iran, with enforced Shiite culture, forced on
<br>
all other groups in Iraq.  How to deal with this and a
<br>
host of similar problems?  How about a Swiss model
<br>
carried down to the individual level, with a social
<br>
contract to establish a base-line on which to build
<br>
local solutions?  Perhaps most Shiites and other
<br>
potential democratic dictatorial groups would be
<br>
satisfied to impose their law on their own believers,
<br>
if a system were universally available to resolve
<br>
disputes outside the group in an equitable manner. 
<br>
This may be more palatable if the alternative is a mix
<br>
of ongoing civil war and outside rule by the U.S. 
<br>
Unlike &quot;political&quot; solutions per se, a social contract
<br>
based system would be fueled by the economic
<br>
advantages to the signatories, such as a means of
<br>
reducing risk enormously in dealing with trading
<br>
partners worldwide.  Yet it could be used to solve a
<br>
host of political problems as a bonus.
<br>
<p>So, we may not really be any worse off due to Bush &amp;
<br>
Co., yet..., altho the civil rights violations
<br>
domestically as well as the wierd situation re &quot;enemy
<br>
combatants&quot; are certainly very scary and will have to
<br>
be resolved.  I put some limited faith in our judicial
<br>
system to ultimately straighten that out into
<br>
something a little more consistent with our Bill of
<br>
Rights, at least.  The world may actually be safer for
<br>
a decade or two due to Bush &amp; Co./World Police Force,
<br>
altho there is always the risk that some of the
<br>
terrorist types may make a major move before they are
<br>
rooted out.
<br>
<p>I.e., we may have a breather here in which to figure
<br>
out the real solutions.
