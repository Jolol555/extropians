<p><em>&gt; For some people to believe X is a threat, there must be

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence is required, and a good theory may be enough.
</em><br>
<p>I did note that during the pre-war debate that a number
<br>
of people (not on this list) allowed the meme &quot;guilt
<br>
beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; to affect their judgment.
<br>
<p>One problem (!) with the people on this list is that
<br>
they don't hang out enough in tough bars, where much
<br>
more standard &quot;rules&quot; hold.  We evolved in situations
<br>
that put a lot of stress on intuition; our responses
<br>
of anger, submission, and intimidation are innate, and
<br>
not always fully comprehendible yet by our rational
<br>
natures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Summing-up amidst charges of being academic...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will eventually fall to academics (which I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not) to review the theories propounded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationales for pre-emption.    
</em><br>
<p>What is scary about many real-world situations is that
<br>
they might not yield to academic analysis.
<br>
<p>&quot;Street Smarts&quot; are something that very few of the gentle
<br>
readers of the Extropian mail list can claim to have.  It
<br>
amounts to, so far as this equally innocent poster is aware,
<br>
presenting a public aspect that intimidates or in other
<br>
ways deters those who would take advantage of one.  (Also
<br>
is conveyed, of course, by the term, is wisdom that would
<br>
guide you in avoiding unwanted confrontations and not
<br>
presenting yourself as a target of opportunity.)  So many
<br>
of the world's civilized people, like you and me, have
<br>
not ever understood what comes very easily to bullies 
<br>
and those who have to live near them.  We more or less
<br>
expect everyone to behave the way our neighbors do, and
<br>
sadly, we then project our intuitive expectations into
<br>
realms where they are not appropriate.
<br>
<p>There have been a number of lessons emerging from recent
<br>
events, so far.  (How many more will emerge is anyone's
<br>
guess, as hardly needs to be said.)  It now seems probable
<br>
that there were
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;*  subtle internal forces in the West that naturally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allied themselves with the horrors of Hussein's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regime.  Certain modes of thought, certain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systematic misjudgments.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;*  a serious lack of good intuition concerning the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motivations and psychology of the Iraqis, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps many other Arab countries as well (Where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are all the terrorist reprisals that so many of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us, not excluding me, were certain would occur
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when an invasion commenced?)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;*  (and as Keith points out) a serious intuitive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lack of understanding of the role and effects of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threats and actions;  perhaps even a similar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;misunderstandings of the realities of dominance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and submission.
<br>
<p>The aspirations of many people around the world, and the
<br>
understandable resentment that many have against the United
<br>
States are very real, and are not without justification IMO.
<br>
(More about this in another post.)
<br>
<p>The situation is so very much complicated by the acknowledgment
<br>
that many of us have to feel that once again somehow the United
<br>
States has been proved to have been right;  whatever the shifting
<br>
justifications for the war have been; whatever total package
<br>
of motivations has been or is involved; whatever bad omens
<br>
have arisen and worries the future exacerbated---the bottom line
<br>
is that goals have been furthered that practically all of us on
<br>
this list would endorse.
<br>
<p>Future historians might well wonder exactly what, following
<br>
the end of the cold war, took the United States so long in
<br>
getting rid of an enemy like the Baathists.  It now appears
<br>
that the Baath party is similar to the Nazi party in many
<br>
ways, whereas we have been conceiving of Iraq as though
<br>
Hussein had been a simple Latin American strongman.  Should
<br>
members of the Baath party be hunted down wherever they are?
<br>
Future historians may think that even asking such a question
<br>
to be symptomatic of the malaise and peculiar lack of
<br>
confidence the West has in its own ideals.
