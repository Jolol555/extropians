</em><br>
<p>I had a conversation with my girlfriend about your bulbous head theory last
<br>
night, spike. I didn't want to bias her opinions so I did not explain your
<br>
theory until after I probed her for information. The dialogue went something
<br>
like this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Hey sweetheart, I've been wondering about something. What exactly do you
<br>
like about me?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;first of all you're very loving and nurturing toward my
<br>
kids.&quot; 
<br>
<p>(She has two young children. Her answer fits nicely with your general theory
<br>
about females having the buyer's market for mates, but it doesn't go to the
<br>
question of my head size. So I kept probing.)
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't mean that,&quot; I said. &quot;I mean, like, what do you think of size of my
<br>
party parts?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't worry honey, your body part is just fine.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;No, no, no, that's not what I meant either.&quot;
<br>
<p>I then held my chin up high and rotated my head like a peacock displaying
<br>
his feathers. I was hoping she might say &quot;Oh yeah, that reminds me. I really
<br>
like your large head!&quot; but no such comment was forthcoming. I think she
<br>
thought I had a crick in my neck.
<br>
<p>Finally I said, &quot;Don't you like the size of head? I wear size large in hats
<br>
and sunglasses. I can barely even find off-the-shelf hats and sunglasses
<br>
that fit me well.&quot; 
<br>
<p>She said, &quot;I've never noticed that about you. Your head looks
<br>
well-proportioned to your body. If I thought your head was too big then I
<br>
probably wouldn't find you attractive.&quot;
<br>
<p>I explained that my head was only slightly large, not large enough to
<br>
notice, and that her attraction to my large head was a subliminal thing. I
<br>
tried to convince her that she loves me because I have a larger than average
<br>
head.
<br>
<p>She laughed and said &quot;That's not true, baby. I love you for your pimp
<br>
juice.&quot;
<br>
<p>I haven't a clue what pimp juice might be. I think it's a term she picked up
<br>
from the Hip Hop music she listens to on her car radio. I didn't want to
<br>
seem un-hip (I listen mainly to classic rock) so I just smiled approvingly
<br>
while secretly hoping that pimp juice is a good thing for men to have.
<br>
<p>Anyone know the definition of pimp juice? We might need to create a pimp
<br>
juice theory of mate selection.
