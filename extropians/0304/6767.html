<p>You were harshly and unfairly criticizing one or two posts of mine, one in
<br>
which I was *asking* someone (mez) to consider taking my position on this
<br>
subject rather than imposing it on him, or one in which I was *agreeing*
<br>
with another person (Eliezer) who already holds a similar position. In
<br>
essence you were quoting me out of context with a fallacious argument rather
<br>
than considering all my arguments as a whole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand that evolution produced a lot of great things (like us

super-monkeys), 
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Of course that is so Harvey, but we need first to be sure we are optimizing
<br>
the natural human genome with which we were born! Once we've done that, we
<br>
can start looking for ways to transcend the natural diet to which we are
<br>
adapted. 
<br>
<p>While in many respects we have far exceeded the capabilities of our
<br>
prehistoric ancestors, the archeological evidence from human remains is that
<br>
our physical health deteriorated at that time approximately 10-12 thousand
<br>
years ago when grains and dairy became significant parts of the human diet.
<br>
We became shorter, weaker and sicker. One might argue why this happened, but
<br>
not if it happened. 
<br>
<p>Modern medical science (e.g., antibiotics) has helped us reverse that
<br>
negative course somewhat but the timing of the setback was most suspicious
<br>
and seems to be related to the radical change in diet from the
<br>
Paleolithic/Mesolithic to the widespread use of agriculture and dairy in the
<br>
Neolithic. Even without recourse to evolution science it should be clear to
<br>
a nutrition savvy person like you that breads and dairy have relatively
<br>
little nutritional value in comparison to prehistoric foodstuffs like lean
<br>
meats, fruits and vegetables. Do you agree with this?
<br>
<p>I have presented many arguments from evidence and theory that humans should
<br>
have been and in fact were healthier in prehistoric times than early
<br>
Neolithic times. It is only very recently (20th century) that our health has
<br>
begun to approach prehistoric levels, and this seems to be largely despite
<br>
the modern diet rather than because of it. And even with these health
<br>
improvements, mostly from modern medicine, we remain in the midst of an
<br>
unprecedented national health crisis in obesity and diabetes.
