Eliminating Hassles
<br>
by Gregory Heisler for TIME
<br>
<p>While he has yet to reveal the device to the public, rumors
<br>
are circulating about the latest brainchild of Dean Kamen,
<br>
the iconoclastic inventor of the iBot wheelchair and the
<br>
Segway personal transporter.
<br>
<p>&quot;He's really excited about this one,&quot; says my confidential
<br>
source, who represents one of the venture capital firms
<br>
being courted at Kamen's Manchester, NH headquarters, &quot;and
<br>
we hope to be behind him all the way.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kamen will only say that the project--codenamed &quot;Basil&quot;--
<br>
is a high-tech human waste disposal system that, in his
<br>
words, &quot;will be to the typical American flush toilet what
<br>
the toilet was to the outhouse.&quot;  My source believes that
<br>
the device will find its first market among developing
<br>
nations that don't have the plumbing infrastructure of the
<br>
United States, but that he hopes the unique qualities of
<br>
the new system will be appealing enough that even Americans
<br>
will want to change.  &quot;Especially today, when building
<br>
codes are mandating low-flow toilets that no one likes,
<br>
a new system like this will allow homeowners some luxury
<br>
without the environmental costs.&quot;
<br>
<p>Initial units are now being installed in some high-volume
<br>
sites such as office buildings and a Las Vegas hotel now
<br>
under construction. &quot;We think travelers will become
<br>
accustomed to the benefits of Basil, and will start to
<br>
demand it in their hotels wherever they go.&quot;  The initial
<br>
$8,000 price tag might cause some resistance to that, but
<br>
Kamen expects that mass production might lower the costs
<br>
to $3,000 or less, making them available to ordinary
<br>
consumers.
<br>
<p>Kamen will demonstrate the device live on a special episode
<br>
of CBS's &quot;Survivor&quot; on Thursday, April 3.
