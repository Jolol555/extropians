</em><br>
<p>It is interesting that you call these games, for that
<br>
is, in fact, the counter to this problem that human
<br>
nature provides.  If there is no more incentive to
<br>
produce that which improves the human condition, at
<br>
least beyond the improvement you yourself gain, many
<br>
people will find that insufficient and instead choose
<br>
to spend their time in unproductive entertainments.
<br>
From a strictly utilitarian point of view, humanity is
<br>
no better off for having had another Super Bowl, as
<br>
opposed to having spent the same money (as spent on
<br>
player's salaries, advertisements, et cetera) on, say,
<br>
researching bionics that could give any human the
<br>
strength and dexterity of the best football players.
<br>
Society has been aware that this choice could be made
<br>
for many years now, and see what choice it has made
<br>
every time; clearly, strict utilitarianism for the
<br>
greater good is not the guiding mindset.  (Whether
<br>
this is rightly so is another debate, but I'd say it
<br>
is their choice to make.)
<br>
<p>It is not a danger of active mischief, but merely of
<br>
neglect of that which needs to be done, that has
<br>
felled capitalism's alternatives.
