Searching For Meaning In Life May Boost Immune System
<br>
Pursuing goals related to living a meaningful life may boost the activity of
<br>
certain cells in the immune system, according to a small study of women who lost
<br>
a relative to breast cancer.
<br>
Women who placed more importance on these goals at the beginning of the study
<br>
had higher levels of activity among their &quot;natural killer&quot; immune cells. In
<br>
addition, women who elevated the importance of these goals over a one-month
<br>
period showed increases in natural killer cell activity, compared to women who
<br>
said that the importance of these goals had decreased for them. 
<br>
Some of the women in the study were asked to write essays about their loss in an
<br>
attempt to discover whether this activity might change life goals and boost
<br>
immune activity, but the researchers concluded that the writing exercise itself
<br>
was not associated with changes in either. 
<br>
The next step will be to uncover the ways in which &quot;finding meaning gets 'under
<br>
the skin' and influences the immune system,&quot; say Julienne E. Bower, Ph.D., of
<br>
the University of California, Los Angeles and colleagues. 
<br>
Previous research has shown a strong link between stressful events and immune
<br>
system functioning, while other studies suggest that some individuals find
<br>
positive meaning after a stressful event. Bower and colleagues wanted to test
<br>
whether writing about a stressful event might produce positive psychological
<br>
changes that could in turn affect the immune system.
