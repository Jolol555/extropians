From: Amara Graps 
<br>
<p>Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<em>&gt;I am not familiar with the history of the use of MDMA in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychotherapy.  I know that MDA was originally quite successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the treatement of alcoholism, which is what it was designed for.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I'd have to pull out my copy of PIHKAL and look, but some words on
<br>
its use in psychotherapy might be described in that book.
<br>
<p>&quot;Following a paper trail with Dr. Lester Grinspoon might shed some light,
<br>
as well:
<br>

<br>
&quot;Testimony of Dr. Lester Grinspoon, comparing the decision to schedule
<br>
MDMA to the scheduling of LSD, halting potentially beneficial research,
<br>
and discussing MDMA's promise in therapy, April 18, 1985.&quot;
<br>
____________________________
<br>
<p><p>I thought MDMA was first used by therapists to bring out the &quot;real&quot; or true
<br>
feelings of patients who were undergoing emotional blocks in their lives. 
<br>
See history below:
<br>
<p>&quot;History  (<a href="http://www.drugtext.org/sub/mdma1.html">http://www.drugtext.org/sub/mdma1.html</a>)
<br>
<p>This history begins in 1912 when the German company Merck asked for a
<br>
patent on it. (note 114) The patent was allowed to expire without being
<br>
used. They cropped up again when the US army showed an interest in
<br>
hallucinogens and commissioned research in 1953/54 on MDA, MDMA and other
<br>
substances as a truth serum. They proved to be unsuitable for this purpose.
<br>
The results of this research were not published until 1973 (note 115). MDA
<br>
became popular in the Sixties, while MDMA was first identified as a street
<br>
drug in 1972. (note 116)
<br>
<p>In 1978 Shulgin and Nichols (note 117) published a scientific article on
<br>
the structure and effects of MDA, MDMA and other substances. This knowledge
<br>
had already been available for some time, however. Among those who knew
<br>
about it were a number of psychotherapists who increasingly applied MDMA as
<br>
a psychotherapeutic aid. (notes 118, 119) In 1981 it acquired its present
<br>
name, Ecstasy (XTC). This was when its recreational use (as a stimulant)
<br>
started in the ,United States. Soon afterwards its use rapidly spread
<br>
outside the United States as well. In Dallas, where alcohol was prohibited
<br>
at the Southern Methodist University, students bought legal MDMA as a
<br>
substitute, paying by credit card. The US consumption rose from 10,000
<br>
doses in the whole year of 1976 to 30,000 doses a month in 1985. (note 120)
<br>
At the same time the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reported that
<br>
30,000 doses a month were being used in the state of Texas alone. A 1987
<br>
survey revealed that 40% of students on the campus of Stanford University
<br>
had used MDMA.(note 121) In 1985 MDMA was prohibited by the Drug
<br>
Enforcement Administration, when it was given the same status as heroin and
<br>
LSD. 
<br>
<p>MDMA was also used by Baghwan followers and spread to Europe. The setting
<br>
for its use there was different. It was first used on Ibiza, where the
<br>
combination of XTC with dancing to deafening electronic music in an exotic
<br>
nightlife atmosphere was invented. It spread from there to England and the
<br>
Netherlands in particular, where a new youth culture emerged which is now
<br>
spread all over Europe: the 'raves'. 
<br>
<p>A large number of substances are sold under the name of XTC, including
<br>
amphetamine, ketamine, PCP, and caffeine, as~well as a range of 'normal'
<br>
medicines as pure fakes.(note 122) We shall now review the main
<br>
entactogens, whether they are sold as XTC or not. 
<br>
<p>METHYLENEDIOXIAMPHETAMINE (MDA) 
<br>
<p>Shulgin (note 123) describes the hallucinogenic effect of MDA as follows:
<br>
'it produces eyesclosed hallucinations of a commanding sort. There is quite
<br>
consistently a recollection of past events, of childhood memories, a
<br>
reliving of earlier times that appear to be, as far as can be documented,
<br>
quite accurate.' 
<br>
<p>MDA seemed to be unique in that it reinforces mainly emotions and empathy
<br>
to a high degree and creates a strong emotional link with others present.
<br>
It was these effects which made MDA popular as a recreational drug. MDA
<br>
also has a clear sympathomimetic activity. 
<br>
<p>The usual dose is between 80 and 160 mg, and the effect lasts for 8 to 12
<br>
hours. In connection with the search for a truth drug, this substance was
<br>
administered by the US army to a number of test persons, in some cases
<br>
without their knowledge. In one case, a psychiatric patient, the
<br>
intravenous injection of 500 mg was fatal. (note 124)
<br>
<p>METHYLENEDIOXIMETAMPHETAMINE (MDMA) 
<br>
<p>'The first effect is very fast, within half an hour of consumption. Most
<br>
test persons report that the plateau of the effect begins within another
<br>
half hour to one hour. The symptoms of~intoxication have largely vanished
<br>
after another two hours, apart from the slight remains of sympathomimetic
<br>
stimulation, which can last for a number of hours more. There are few
<br>
physical symptoms of intoxication, and psychological postsymptoms are
<br>
virtually absent. In qualitative terms, the drug seems to elicit an easily
<br>
controllable changed state of consciousness with emotional and sensual
<br>
overtones. In terms of effect, it can be compared with marihuana,
<br>
psilocybin without the hallucinatory component, or low doses of MDA.' (note
<br>
117)
<br>
<p>Ten years later, an anonymous informant, a respectable fifty year old,
<br>
described the effect as follows: 
<br>
<p>'The drug removes all your neuroses. It takes away the fear of response.
<br>
There is an overwhelming sense of peace, you are at peace with the world.
<br>
You feel open, clear, tender. I can't imagine that anyone is angry under
<br>
its influence, or selfish or mean of defensive. You have lots of insight
<br>
into yourself, real insight, which you hold on to after the experience is
<br>
gone.' (note 125)&quot;
