Hi Folks,
<br>
<p>Last November 20, 2002, we had this brief conversation
<br>
(Subject- &quot;some (early) Leonids results&quot;) on extropians:
<br>
<p>Hal Finney:
<br>
<em>&gt;I don't know if it was just the bright moon washing out the dimmer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meteors, or if the predicted rates of 3000-6000 per hour were vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exaggerations.
</em><br>
<p>Amara Graps
<br>
<em>&gt;The moon was almost full, which had something to do with it. However
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'vast exaggerations' is not really fair. The scientists making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predictions had a model that gave meteor rates. This year, the rates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were 1/3, or less, of the predictions. The (sophisticated) Leonids
</em><br>
<em>&gt;models had been getting better and better at matching data, up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;Therefore, while it is sad for all of the people who did not see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;show, it means that there _might_ be some new physics, that wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;included in the models before. That's really interesting.
</em><br>
<p><p>I was wrong, the predictions and models were in very good agreement.
<br>
What was different this last (big) shower, was that there were many
<br>
faint meteors. These faint meteors were predicted in earlier years
<br>
too, but not seen, which is one of the puzzles for the Leonids.
<br>
<p>To recap:
<br>
<p>The Leonids are caused by a stream of predominantly very small
<br>
particles, less than 1 mm in size, which orbit the Sun with a period
<br>
of 33 years, together with their parent comet, Tempel-Tuttle. The
<br>
orbit of the Leonid particles intersect the Earth's orbit. Each year
<br>
around November 17, when the Earth is at this intersection, Leonid
<br>
particles enter the Earth's atmosphere and cause meteors. Along the
<br>
larger part of Comet Tempel-Tuttle's orbit, Leonid particles are
<br>
scattered sparsely, so that, in most years, we see only a few Leonid
<br>
meteors per hour. Only in the vicinity of the comet, the density of
<br>
Leonid particles is much higher. Consequently, every 33 years,
<br>
during the years that Comet Tempel-Tuttle revisits our region of the
<br>
Solar System, much higher Leonid activity is recorded.
<br>
<p>In 2002 November, the Earth encountered Leonid trails created at the
<br>
1866 and 1767 returns of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. These trails are
<br>
respectively 4 and 7 revolutions old.  The 1767 return (&quot;left&quot; peak)
<br>
was favored by the W. Africa, W. Europe, NE Canada, NE S. America
<br>
observers, and the 1866 return of the comet trail was favored by N.
<br>
America observers.
<br>
<p>See the following for descriptions of the predictions:
<br>

<br>
<p>You can see some results here:
<br>
<p>Leonids Multi-aircraft Campaign (The USAF FISTA and NASA DC-8
<br>
aircrafts flew from Spain to Nebraska during the shower).

<br>
[... scroll down the page to the Zenith Hourly Rate (ZHR) versus Time
<br>
plot]
<br>
<p>Two Leonid storms were seen on Nov 19 2002. In each case, the peak
<br>
occurred 10-20 minutes later than predicted, but observations
<br>
matched prediction. European observers saw the peak at 04:09 UT (ZHR
<br>
= 2,300/hr), while observers in the America's witnessed a storm
<br>
peaking at 10:50 UT (ZHR = 2,600/hr). Both peaks were narrow, with a
<br>
full-width-at-half-maximum of only 0.52 and 0.50 hours,
<br>
respectively. Both peaks were also rich in faint meteors. As a
<br>
result, the near-full Moon and bad weather at prime observing sites
<br>
made visual observations from the ground difficult.
<br>
<p>Last Thursday at the joint European Geophysics Society (EGS) and
<br>
American Geophysical Union (AGU)  meeting in Nice, France, (*), I
<br>
had the pleasure to watch Peter Jenniskens' presentation showing ~15
<br>
minutes of video of the first Leonids 2002 peak (that trail from the
<br>
1767 return of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle). The meteor storm looked
<br>
like a canopy of diamonds gently falling from the sky. Lovely!
<br>
<p>The new interesting physics is why were the peaks so narrow? I asked
<br>
during the question session why Poynting-Robertson drag did not
<br>
spread out the peaks, and Peter didn't know. There's some interesting
<br>
physics occurring here to confine the peaks. Here we have work for
<br>
some new PhD theses, so those of you with a love for physics and an
<br>
itch to go to grad school ...
<br>

<br>
<p><p>(*) This year was the first joint meeting of the two huge research
<br>
societies, and I hope that they do not combine their meetings again.
<br>
Even with the U.S. cancellations, there were too many people
<br>
(&gt;10,000), elbow to elbow, ~2000 posters every day, too many parallel
<br>
sessions, poorly organized and very expensive. However my Heidelberg
<br>
dust colleagues organized a great dust session, the best we've ever had
<br>
at the EGS, and that made the conference frustrations worthwhile. Oh,
<br>
and Nice is a beautiful city, even when it rains.
