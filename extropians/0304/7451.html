From: Robert J. Bradbury [mailto:<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=RE:%20HEALTH:%20Why%20antioxidants%20don't%20work">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; For many years I have always suspected there was a reason 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that antioxidant vitamin supplements (Vit E, C, etc.) didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend lifespan more.  I ran across hints that various 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oxidized molecules such as superoxide or hydrogen peroxide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be used as signal molecules and the genetic program was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to keep them within certain ranges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, now I finally have a concrete example of this.  Others 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the list may have been more aware of this but I was not so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sharing it.
</em><br>
<p>[snip much good content]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The bottom line from my perspective is that if the cell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to use H2O2 as a signaling molecule it will do so and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking all the Vitamin E and C in the world isn't going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent that.  (Which isn't to say that Vitamin E might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly useful to keep cholesterol from becoming oxidized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and contributing to the formation of plaques).  It seems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely that antioxidants are going to impact much on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oxidative damage to DNA (and therefore cancer and some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of aging).
</em><br>
<p>Fascinating!  Thanks for posting, Robert.  I hadn't caught these
<br>
papers.
<br>
<p>It's strange, though, that up-regulation of endogenous anti-oxidants
<br>
/does/ slow aging.  We know of a couple fruit fly models and at least
<br>
one mouse model where the organisms have been genetically engineered
<br>
to have higher levels of superoxide dismutase or catalase, and have
<br>
(apparently as a result) had slower aging, longer mean and maximum
<br>
lifespan, and greater resistance to stress.
<br>
<p>In the mouse model, the catalase is specifically targeted to the
<br>
mitochondria.  The fact that upregulating endogenous anti-oxidants in
<br>
the mitochondria extends life seems to support the mitochondrial free
<br>
radical theory of aging.
<br>
<p>So do you have any thoughts on why that those mutant creatures are
<br>
life extended, as it pertains to your post above?
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
