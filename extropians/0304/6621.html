<em>&gt; Here is quote from an old 1950's diet book I was browsing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In 1921 coronary thrombosis was a rarity and accounted for only 746
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; male deaths in Britain. In 1956 the figure was 45,000. It is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still going up.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  I simply do not believe that statistic.  It's inconsistent with
<br>
other data from that time period.  For example in the US in 1921,
<br>
137,000 people died of heart disease, out of a total of about 1
<br>
million deaths in the US that year.
<br>
<p>Let me summarize the CDCs statistics for US causes of death in 1921.
<br>
In descending order of incidence:
<br>
<p>CAUSE				% of ALL DEATHS 
<br>
Heart Disease		14% 
<br>
Pneumonia			9%
<br>
Tuberculosis		9%
<br>
Stroke			8%
<br>
Cancer			7%
<br>
Nephritis			5%
<br>
Accidents			5%
<br>
Diarrhea &amp; enteritis	4%
<br>
Premature birth		4%
<br>
Diphtheria			1-2%
<br>
<p>These stats are available at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/lead1900_98.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/lead1900_98.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>What they suggest to me is about what I'd expect.  In 1921 the US was
<br>
in a transition from the pre-1900 period (when infectious disease was
<br>
responsible for most deaths) to the late 20th century (when
<br>
age-related problems were responsible for most deaths).
<br>
<p>Note that life expectancy in 1921 US was somewhere in the low 50s.
<br>
<p>This is consistent with a model where the conquering of infectious
<br>
disease has allowed humans to live longer and, for the first time,
<br>
experience the problems of old age such as heart disease and cancer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So I don't believe the argument that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are only seeing this huge rise in that set of diseases because we
</em><br>
are 
<br>
<em>&gt; living longer is accurate. In 1920 people over 50 simply _did not_ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer from heart attacks very often at all. Something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed in just a few short decades to make this a much more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common event, and so far science has not figured it out.
</em><br>
<p>Well, in the US between 1920 and 2002, heart disease has gone from
<br>
causing 14% of all deaths to 50% of all deaths.  But incidence of
<br>
infectious disease deaths has dropped almost to zero, and life
<br>
expectancy has increased by more than 20 years.  So that doesn't seem
<br>
to hard to explain.
<br>
<p>Also note that infectious diseases are particularly dangerous not only
<br>
to the very young, but to the old, the very same people at risk of
<br>
heart disease and cancer!  Now that we've effectively conquered
<br>
infectious disease in the US it doesn't matter, but if you look at the
<br>
pattern of death by age in earlier civilizations you'll find that the
<br>
old died of infectious diseases much more frequently than young or
<br>
middle-age adults.
<br>
<p>At the same time, I completely agree that lifestyle factor are also to
<br>
blame for an increased incidence of heart disease.  Americans in 2002
<br>
consume more total calories, more fat, and more sugar than at any
<br>
point in last few centuries.  They also live an unprecedented
<br>
sedentary lifestyle.  
<br>
<p>So, put all of this together and I don't see why you say that science
<br>
hasn't figured out why heart disease has become the leading killer. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It very well could be due to dietary changes- most of which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were shifts away from eating traditional/natural foods. 
</em><br>
<p>By traditional/natural do you mean pre-agrarian?  If so, I doubt you
<br>
could find much evidence of that in the early 1900s.
