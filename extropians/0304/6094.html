Arab World Stunned by Baghdad's Fall
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;Across the Middle East, people struggled to reconcile images of celebrating
<br>
Iraqis with widely held suspicions about the United States' motives.&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, I am sure some members of this list are stuggling to put a negative
<br>
spin on this event as well.  How to reconclie the jubilation the Iraqi
<br>
people exhibited at being liberated by the US, when the US is just an evil
<br>
aggressor!?  I didnt see any Iraqi people protesting their own liberation!!!
<br>
Odd how there were probably more people protesting their liberation then
<br>
there were Iraqi people under oppresion.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now no one believes Al-Jazeera anymore,&quot; said Ali Hassan, a government
<br>
employee in Cairo, Egypt referring to the Arabic-language television news
<br>
channel. &quot;
<br>
<p>Interesting to see that the largest Arab News source has lost significant
<br>
credibility, where will Arabs now turn for their non-western news?  What
<br>
impact might this have on Arab perceptions of the world in general?
<br>
<p>&quot;The entire front page of the pan-Arab newspaper Asharq al-Awsat was devoted
<br>
to a photograph of the pulling down Saddam's statue in Baghdad. Above it,
<br>
the headline: &quot;And Saddam's regime fell — Shock in Arab capitals, joy in
<br>
Baghdad...&quot;
<br>
<p>This is pretty significant stuff.  How Will Arabs reconcile these images?
<br>
<p>&quot;Many Arabs — even those who saw Saddam as an oppressive dictator — had
<br>
viewed the war as the struggle of an Arab underdog against foreign invaders
<br>
interested in Iraqi oil. Most Egyptians, for instance, do not believe that
<br>
Saddam had terrorist connections or weapons of mass destruction&quot;
<br>
<p>Egypt is the single biggest recipient of Foriegn aide from the US, some 12
<br>
billion per year, yet it is also a totalitarian.  It was one of the first
<br>
Arab nations to speak out against and condemn the US / British Coalition to
<br>
dispose Saddam one the effort commenced.  One must wonder what is going
<br>
through the heads of Arab nation's tyrannical leaders 'Oh no, now MY people
<br>
will want democracy and freedom!!!' and then 'How can I make sure my people
<br>
hate America more than me?, keep them oppresed and make sure to blame
<br>
America!'
<br>
<p>&quot;So the quick fall of Baghdad and Iraqi jubilation came as a shock.&quot;
<br>
<p>A statement that speaks for itself.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the West Bank city of Nablus, Yousef Mizher, 32, said that at the
<br>
beginning of the war, he distributed 300 photos of Saddam along with the
<br>
Palestinian newspapers he delivers daily because &quot;I loved this guy.&quot;  &quot;But
<br>
when I saw the defeat yesterday on TV, I realized how silly I had been.
<br>
Saddam is just like any Arab leader. He wants to stay in power at the
<br>
expense of the blood and bones of his people,&quot; Mizher said. Saddam, he
<br>
added, should have gone into exile instead of sacrificing his people in a
<br>
war with the Americans.&quot; &quot;
<br>
<p>Note Here is a previous supporter of Saddam changing his mind, and
<br>
acknowledging that Saddam is in fact morally culpable for the deaths of the
<br>
people he oppresses.  A change of mind that some members of this list are
<br>
incapable of, and a recogition of moral culpability that also has been
<br>
ignored by opponents of this effort.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't like the idea of having the Americans here, but we asked for it,&quot;
<br>
said Tannous Basil, a cardiologist in Sidon, Lebanon. &quot;Why don't we see the
<br>
Americans going to Finland, for example? They come here because our area is
<br>
filled with dictatorships like Saddam's.&quot;
<br>
<p>And, Finally,
<br>
<p>&quot;Some, however, said they hoped the fall of Saddam could signal a new move
<br>
toward democracy in the Middle East&quot;
<br>
<p>Note these were Arabs that were saying this.  The meme for democracy
<br>
spreading in the Middle East amongst Arab peoples could have significant
<br>
progressive results in the middle east.
