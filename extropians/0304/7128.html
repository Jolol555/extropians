So, after a few days away from this thread, some last thoughts on it
<br>
(for now).
<br>
<p>The paleo diet seems moderately compatible with the best modern
<br>
nutritional science.  It's high in fiber, high in micronutrients, low
<br>
in saturated fat, low in simple sugars, and low in high glycemic index
<br>
foods.  The high protein may or may not be a plus - we know that
<br>
saturated fat is a health risk but we're not sure if meat is a health
<br>
risk for other reasons.  I think there are changes you could make to
<br>
the paleo diet to make it substantially more convenient /and/ probably
<br>
healthier.  Even so, the unmodified paleo diet is almost certainly
<br>
healthier than the saturated fat and sugar filled diet of modern
<br>
westerners.
<br>
<p>My main issue in this whole thread has not been the diet itself, but
<br>
the purported evidence and reasoning used to support the diet.  The
<br>
evolutionary argument is not convincing, for reasons we've hashed over
<br>
many times.  The clear evidence that early farmers were less healthy
<br>
than their hunter gatherer predecessors is more convincing, but still
<br>
fairly circumstantial.
<br>
<p>If I were trying to convince someone of the paleo diet, I'd start by
<br>
positioning it as a diet that reflects the best current science (low
<br>
sat fat, low sugar and starch, high fiber, etc...) and would then get
<br>
into the health differences between H/Gs and early farmers, and only
<br>
last would call on any evolutionary reasoning to show why we might be
<br>
better adapted to eating those ancient foods.  
<br>
<p>Anyway, that's my $.02.  This has been an enjoyable and educational
<br>
thread for me.  Thanks all.
