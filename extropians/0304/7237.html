<em>&gt;&gt;  You must, at least according to DA theory, accept that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you, Ramez Naam of 2003, are a single random sample taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from the population of all humans ever to live past or present
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [or future].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should I accept that I'm a random sample taken from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population of all humans ever to live past or present?  I see no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification for that. 
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't want to get too firmly entrenched here because like you I have some
<br>
doubts about the DA, at least at an intuitive level. The deeper
<br>
understanding of this problem is something I've put on the back-burner until
<br>
I can find more time to devote brain cells to it. :) For that reason I am
<br>
hardly an expert on the subject compared to others here have who have
<br>
probably spent more time than me puzzling over it (see some other threads
<br>
here on the subject, past and present). 
<br>
<p>However the assumption you question is called the SSA (Self-Sampling
<br>
Assumption). The SSA does not itself seem unreasonable to me. It is defined
<br>
thusly: &quot;Every observer should reason as if she were a random sample from
<br>
the set of all observers in their reference class.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Put simply, why should you assume that your observation of any particular
<br>
phenomenon should be different from anyone else's? For example when you do a
<br>
statistical test on a coin to determine if the coin is fair, you assume that
<br>
your observation of the coin's flips is a random sample of coin flip
<br>
observations taken from the population of all possible coin flip
<br>
observations of that coin that might be taken by all possible humans; i.e.,
<br>
you assume that your observations are a random sample from the set of all
<br>
observers in your reference class with regard to that coin, where your
<br>
reference class is &quot;humans&quot; or &quot;intelligent beings.&quot; If you don't make that
<br>
assumption then you cannot say that your analysis of the coin is meaningful
<br>
to other humans.
<br>
<p>Now, you argue that people in the distant past who accepted the DA would
<br>
have been wrong. But consider for a moment that if the DA is true, the
<br>
number of people who would have been wrong would have represented a
<br>
relatively small % of humans ever to have lived. This is so because the
<br>
population of homo sapiens has been growing exponentially through time, or
<br>
roughly so.
<br>
<p>In other words, if 60 billion people have so far lived, (a reasonable
<br>
estimate), and if doomsday is in fact imminent, the chances of any random
<br>
person taken from those 60 billion persons making a wrong prediction
<br>
regarding doomsday in their time is rather small, because most of those
<br>
observers live or lived in modern times rather than in ancient or
<br>
prehistoric times. If the argument is true then it is much more likely that
<br>
you will randomly select a correct DA predictor from the history of all
<br>
humans. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me put it more formally.  A good hypothesis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsifiable.  So how would we falsify the Doomsday Argument?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wait some arbitrary period of time to see if the world really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ends?  How long would we have to wait before deciding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's moot?  1 day?  1 year?  1 billion years? 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it can be falsified through experiment. It's a mathematical
<br>
argument open to falsification only through reason alone.
<br>
<p>As I interpret it, (and again I am no expert), all the DA really can (try
<br>
to) say is that whatever your estimate about the probability of doomsday was
<br>
*before* you considered the argument, it must now be revised toward a more
<br>
pessimistic view *after* you have considered the argument.
