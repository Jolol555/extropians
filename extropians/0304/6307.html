</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *very* long term trend, perhaps.  I've seen studies saying that heights at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least didn't climb back up to pre-agricultural heights until the 20th century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Between tall Cro-Magnons and tall agribusiness-fed Americans are a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short people with bad teeth.  And not just the lower classes, necessarily.
</em><br>
<p>By coincidence, I just ran across this passage in the fine book  &quot;In the
<br>
Hands of the Great Spirit&quot;, by Jake Page.  (The sub-title is &quot;The 20,000
<br>
Year history of the American Indians.)  The book is great.  For one thing,
<br>
he points out that Native Americans living in the lower 48 states don't
<br>
like to be called &quot;Native Americans&quot;, because this title is too loose, and
<br>
fits Eskimos and Aztecs too.  They prefer &quot;American Indian&quot;, perhaps a
<br>
preference going all the way back to AIM?
<br>
<p>On page 69 he is talking about some of the tribes inhabiting the eastern U.S.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each such settlement was permanent, year-round, and used usually for 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some ten years before the family moved on.  Life was generally good:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except for such relatively minor health problems as dental caries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(from eating so much corn), the commoners were generally in as good
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;health as the elite.  They gainsay the adage that with the coming
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of agriculture, people tend to grow smaller in stature.
<br>
<p>So, the pendulum goes back again (probably on a smaller oscillation).
<br>
Medieval people didn't think of early agriculturalists at all (they
<br>
hardly existed for them);  Burke thought them very hard up, then
<br>
Rousseau that they were much better off than we, then 19th and 20th
<br>
century (I guess) anthropologists thought them unhealthy, and now
<br>
finally here we are seeing that it's quite a mixed bag.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Art Institute of Chicago has a very stable exhibit in Gunsaulus Hall, full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of medieval armor and weapons.  What's interesting is that the suits of full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plate armor they have on display are about 5'2&quot;.  (Not exact number.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *short*.  You look over the helmet, then realize the armor is on a raised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; platform to begin with.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I knew that the Spaniards were quite short compared to us, and it's
<br>
also true that people in the last decades all over the world are bigger.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I've seen criticism of the common statement &quot;well, at least they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better off than on the farm&quot; regarding the conditions of 19th century factory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers.  It's not clear that the front line of workers, working 12+ hours a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day in dark factories and living in crowded and filthy tenements were better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off than they would have been on a farm.  Their grandchildren, yes, much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better off...
</em><br>
<p>Well, we need more research on this, or perhaps Steve Davies knows.
<br>
I've finished an interesting book called &quot;The Five Points&quot; which
<br>
traces the history of the famous awful slum of New York, and the
<br>
passage from Ireland of many people to it.  Not only had they been
<br>
starving in Ireland, but even at the best of times had a standard
<br>
of living much worse than in the famous cesspool &quot;The Five Points&quot;.
<br>
I still think that there is a tendency for us to react as Charles
<br>
Dickens did and be very appalled at factory life, yet (probably)
<br>
be quite ignorant of just how bad it was.  But I grant your example,
<br>
and the possibility that you are right.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; One is reminded of Robin Hanson's &quot;What if Uploads Come First?&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a bleak (and to me slightly unbelievable) picture of how once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; again high tech might result in a *lowering* of income.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smart educated people command high incomes because they're rare and expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce.  If they become mass producible, a commodity even, why shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the price they command drop?  Just like music files on the internet.  Bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to be free...
</em><br>
<p>I think that a Singularity will occur before uploads (hence the
<br>
logic of Robin's title).  But I should refresh myself on his paper
<br>
before saying more.
