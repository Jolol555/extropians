<p><em>&gt; On another

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, the two propositions 'life is common in the universe' and 'we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a typical civilization' are not compatible.  As Fermi asked, if life is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common, where is it? We must conclude that if life is common, most life is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not technologically advanced enough to be detectable. If this is true, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are atypical.
</em><br>
<p>We are &quot;atypical&quot;.  There are 3 types of &quot;intelligences&quot; in the universe.
<br>
<p>a) Those too simple to produce detectable signs.  We can't even detect
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth like planets now.  Perhaps we will have this ability in 15 years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even then we have to &quot;go there&quot; to detect such intelligences (whales
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dolphins come to mind).
<br>
b) Civilizations like us.  The problem is that these civilizations have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extremely short lifetimes.  Dyson pointed out that if we grow at the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current rate we exhaust the resources of the solar system in less than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 years (except the sun).  Add that to a ~2000 year old civilization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the &quot;typical&quot; lifetime of civilizations like ours is ~3000 years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to the dawn of civilization in Egypt or Iraq and you might
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add perhaps 3000 more years.  6000 years is the blink of an eye in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms of the evolution and survival of advanced civilizations.
<br>
c) Civilizations more advanced than us.  If these exist one has to extract
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them from the galactic background radiation at temperatures below LN2
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and perhaps almost as low as the GBR itself.  (This was pointed out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Minsky as the ideal thermodynamic situation that advanced civilizations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would seek at the first U.S.-Russian SETI conference.)
<br>
<p>The bulk of the civilizations in the galaxy should be at stage (c) [in
<br>
part because if Lineweaver is correct ~70% of the &quot;Earths&quot; in the galaxy
<br>
should be *older* than the Earth -- at least until they get dismantled.]
<br>
<p>We are not going to &quot;see&quot; them (class c) without using different methods.
<br>
To start with you don't point your detectors (radio or optical) at *stars*
<br>
because advanced civilizations &quot;hide&quot; their stars.  Second they aren't
<br>
going to want to communicate with us because we are way to stupid (they
<br>
can probably run a simulation for all of humanity if they wanted to).
<br>
Third unless things like subspace communications and transwarp conduits
<br>
are *real* interstellar communication is a pointless exercise.
<br>
<p>Advanced civilizations are more concerned with:
<br>
(a) How do I lengthen the lifetime of my star (i.e. implement star-lifting)
<br>
or
<br>
(b) How do I determine a least cost method for gathering new material to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself so I can have greater amounts of computronium (CPU or memory
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capacity) and/or lengthen the lifetime of my star.
<br>
or
<br>
(c) How do I pick the least dangerous path through the galaxy (no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supernovas, neutron star collisions, etc. in my vicinity) with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requirement that you have to navigate something with the mass of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an entire solar system.
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>P.S. Keith, if you haven't read the papers on Matrioshka Brains and
<br>
related references, esp. the paper cited by Anders, you may want to
<br>
do so.  That will give you a fair amount to think about.
