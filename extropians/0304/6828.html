</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's actually a very important point: the level of technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does make a lot of difference. Years ago, when technology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world economy was such that the only actors capable of doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major damage to a country as a whole were other countries, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very first attack was unlikely to be decisive, it made sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think of defense in terms of countries, and to have a policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of not attacking until attacked first.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I argue that no small entity today is really capable 
<br>
of doing &quot;major damage to the country as a whole&quot;.   Taking out 
<br>
a city is about the extend of realistic damage.  Biological 
<br>
attacks are actually rather difficult to do on a large scale 
<br>
successfully.  The story may be different when/if we have full 
<br>
MNT.  But we aren't there yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At today's level of technology, we're on the edge: clearly now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small non-nation groups can cause serious damage and have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so,
</em><br>
<p>That depends on what you call &quot;serious&quot;, doesn't it?  Compared 
<br>
to countries at war the death of a few thousand may not qualify 
<br>
as &quot;serious&quot; for the purpose of justifying attack on other 
<br>
countries not at war with us and which did not claim credit for 
<br>
such an attack and who were not provably linked to the attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so the age of &quot;countries&quot; is past. But it's probably still
</em><br>
<p>Your argument so far does not justify that conclusion yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the case that a first strike won't be devastating, so we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably still not justified in attacking someone like Hussein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is unlikely to directly cause us great harm, and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really have the means to even if he wanted to. But imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving just a little bit into a very likely future, where a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapon technology exists that would make it possible for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single person or small group to create and deploy a weapon that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would cause major damage to an entire country without warning.
</em><br>
<p>I suggest we deal with that when we get there and not use it to 
<br>
establish policy today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a person existed that were clearly mentally ill, had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of violence, had the means to deploy such a weapon, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a clearly expressed irrational hatred for a certain people, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would hardly blame those people for eliminating that clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger to their very existence at a lower level of threat--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, proof that he had negotiated to buy materials for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapon--rather than waiting for a devastating loss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but such hypotheticals are not currently applicable. 
<br>
Generally speaking, buying the means of defense/offense is not 
<br>
the same as being subject to justifiable elimination.  At 
<br>
today's understanding, for a nation or even group to seek such 
<br>
means might even be the height of prudence as a deterrent 
<br>
against attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An actionable threat requires all three of means, credible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intent, and immediacy. Clearly it can't be justified to react
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a threat that doesn't have the means to destroy you, or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hasn't clearly expressed intent to, or that hasn't done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something to make you reasonably fear for your existence /now/,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the decision has to be made. But if all three of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are indeed present, I would consider standing idle not to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilized restraint, but suicidal foolishness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Of course this would be only if the soon-to-be target of your 
<br>
civilized consideration is not capable of effective and overly 
<br>
expensive self-defense against your attack or the target's 
<br>
allies are not so capable.   In short, this is not a game played 
<br>
among equals.
