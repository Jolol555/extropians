<em>&gt; &gt; As if links to Pat Buchanan, Phyllis Schlafly and Ann
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Coulter aren't enough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, they're not.  I don't consider any of those individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be racists.  I do disagree with Pat Buchanan about a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of things.  But what is the worst thing your or the others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have found?
</em><br>
<p>I never said Pat, Phyllis and Ann were racists.  (They may well be, but I
<br>
didn't say that.)
<br>
<p>Phyllis Schlafly has opposed the Equal Rights Amendment; is a big censorship
<br>
advocate (certain books, films - among them Romeo and Juliet, and sexually
<br>
explicit materials of all kinds), wants to control reproductive rights,
<br>
opposes sex education and AIDS education in schools ... er, had enough?
<br>
<p>Besides the many other things with which I and Pat Buchanan would disagree,
<br>
he doesn't seem to understand what religious freedom is all about (and as an
<br>
nontheist, I have to keep my antennae tuned to such bigotry):

<br>
<p>We spoke of Bill O'Reilly lately.  Ann Coulter was the only right-wing guest
<br>
I've seen on his show who enraged O'Reilly enough (her particularly
<br>
obnoxious demeanor out-rivaled his own! i.e., made O'Reilly seem
<br>
oh-so-charming by comparison) that he *almost* started taking the
<br>
left/liberal position just to irk her.  (Oh, gawd, that show is a scream
<br>
sometimes!)  Ann certainly doesn't mince words:
<br>
<p>We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate
<br>
liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed too. Otherwise they
<br>
will turn out to be outright traitors. -- Ann Coulter
<br>
<p>And if you're really a glutton for punishment:

<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; how about this delectable morsel from the vdare.com site (regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the 14-year-old boy in 1955 who was killed in the summer of 1955 for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;what would now be called sexual harassment of a white woman&quot;)?:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good.  Something specific.  I assume, Olga, that the following is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from that web site somewhere:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; VDARE.COM does not, as it happens, advocate lynching. But it cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; denied that Till was lynched for what would now be called the sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; harassment of a white woman.  And elementary math suggests that, in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; almost five decades since his death, up to 1.5 million white women may
</em><br>
have&gt; &gt; &gt; been raped by blacks.
<br>
<p>Yes, it certainly is from the vdare.com website.  (Ahhhh, but they say they
<br>
*don't* advocate lynching, how big of them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is this typical?  I *would* consider that racist.  After all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where are the corresponding figures for black on black, white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on black and white on white?
</em><br>
<p>Typical?  IMO that's a bit like asking ... Are you a little bit pregnant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Besides, from your link,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html">http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't see anything about &quot;sexual harassment at all&quot;.  Looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just like an old-fashioned lynching.
</em><br>
<p>Yet vdare.com states &quot;... But it cannot be denied that Till was lynched for
<br>
what would now be called the sexual harassment of a white woman.&quot;  With such
<br>
a biased view, how credible can this site be?
<br>
<p>The Emmett Till lynching in the summer of 1955, coupled with the Rosa Parks
<br>
incident later that year, were two of the better known cases which gave
<br>
impetus (after decades and decades of such atrocities) to what eventually
<br>
came to be known as the civil rights decade.
