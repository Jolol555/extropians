<p><em>&gt; When I teleport, I want to anticipate a 100% subjective probability

</em><br>
<em>&gt; where I'm going.  I therefore want to be moved, not copied.
</em><br>
<p>I think that it is the deepest mistake I've been able to 
<br>
identify in a decades-long examination of the identity
<br>
paradox to suppose that it's a question of probability.
<br>
<p>In other words, if you teleport to point B and your point A
<br>
version is not disintegrated, then with 100% probability
<br>
you arrive at B *and* with 100% probability you remain at A.
<br>
Needless to say, this is highly counter-intuitive, and although
<br>
evolution has prepared us for understanding being at two times
<br>
in the same place, we are unprepared for the logically equally
<br>
real possibility of being in two places at the same time.
<br>
<p>That you *should* anticipate being in both places is demonstrated
<br>
by the possibility that later the memories conceivably could be
<br>
merged; at that point, it would be apparent to the future you
<br>
that it had been a mistake not to anticipate both possibilities.
<br>
<p>If you were fleeing a horrible situation by teleport, it would
<br>
be understandable that no you would wish to remain at A.  But
<br>
under normal circumstances, your life's goals would be advanced
<br>
by remaining at A along with going to B.
