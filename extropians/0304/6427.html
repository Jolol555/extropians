<em>&gt;&gt;From the archaeological evidence I've seen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;humans didn't become successful enough hunters to rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;meat for a large % of their calories until relatively recently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you haven't seen the evidence. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is evidence that hominids were eating large game meat as far back as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *2 million* years ago, though at the time we were scavengers rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters. Sites were discovered that suggest early hominids were crushing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bones and eating the marrow of beasts killed by other predators. 
</em><br>
<p>As scavengers and before much tool use I would think that it 
<br>
would be a relatively rare occurence that we got much of some 
<br>
other animal's kill in competition with other more specialize 
<br>
scavengers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't recall offhand the estimated date of the earliest evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wide-spread hunting but I know it was hardly &quot;recent&quot; in evolutionary terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is thought that Paleolithic humans in Europe actually hunted many species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into extinction, which may itself have helped to give rise to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agricultural revolution out of sheer necessity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you'll forgive me for saying so, your argument that Paleolithic diets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not largely animal-based (which I define as 30% to 50% of calories) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outdated. It's the last bastion of vegetarians and their kin who still cling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the old argument that we were living in trees and eating oranges and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bananas until about 50,000 years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There is no reason for such an accusation.  Either the facts are 
<br>
otherwise or they are not.  Why make it a contest between those 
<br>
who believe it best to eat no meat and those who believe it best 
<br>
to eat some meat?  Is the quesiton how much meat is healthy in 
<br>
the human diet?  Are we willing to really research into this and 
<br>
acknowledge opinions and bias from facts?  It is seems pretty 
<br>
unlikely that Paleolithic diets were as much as 30-50% animal 
<br>
based calaories.  It is damn hard to hunt and bring in that much 
<br>
meat regularly at that level of hominid development.  Examining 
<br>
our near cousins in the evolutionary tree today and primitive 
<br>
societies I don't think there is a lot of evidence for such a 
<br>
meat rich diet that far back.  What more do you have?
