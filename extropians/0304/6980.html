<p>Okay, sorry I wasn't aware that you think your bulbous head theory of
<br>
mate-selection is no longer in effect. I suppose then that what you're
<br>
saying is that now that women have got their big-headed men, they're on to
<br>
something else. (Good for them, too. Women are always scheming about
<br>
something with regard to mate-selection, and this is probably a good thing
<br>
for the human species! :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pimp juice gave rise to more and better pimp juice.  
</em><br>
<p>Right, I gotcha'. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After I thought it over, I am no longer convinced that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it matters so much if the mating is female-choice driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or male-choice.  As Lee Corbin pointed out, we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current situation where the females can have as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children as they want and males have little say in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the matter really.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, I wouldn't agree with Lee on that, necessarily, at least with respect
<br>
to married couples and committed relationships like my own. In sociological
<br>
terms, I think that in the 70's the pill was all about female sexual
<br>
freedom. But I think it's not only a female freedom thing in 2003. It's
<br>
about sexual freedom for everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, if we get gene modification, that throws the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mate-selection mechanism for evolution into high gear.  Or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it needs to be modelled as a completely separate mechanism, neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival selection nor mate selection.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting question! Can't say I know the answer. 
<br>
<p>Off-hand I would guess that when and if gene-modification of embryos becomes
<br>
viable, the legislature will restrict access to the technology to married
<br>
couples, or their equivalent. In other words I don't think unwed 18 year old
<br>
girls will have legal access to the technology if they can't show that it
<br>
was not their only intention to get pregnant by some horny unnamed drunk guy
<br>
in order to have a super-baby.
