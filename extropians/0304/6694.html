<p>You are correct that I see this as a very dangerous approach to AI.
<br>
<p>Supposing that the experiment doesn't just fizzle, and you arrive at a 
<br>
baby-level intelligence rather than an unstoppable horror erupting from 
<br>
your computer, what are you going to do with the baby?  You don't know how 
<br>
to make it Friendly.  If you had that kind of theoretical understanding 
<br>
you wouldn't be poking around.
<br>
<p>There is no &quot;unlikely&quot; here.  There is only an unnecessary existential risk.
<br>
<p>Just don't go there.  If you don't know what you're doing, don't mess 
<br>
around until you do.  Don't try to guess whether the risk is large or 
<br>
small; if you have to guess, that means you don't know enough to guess. 
<br>
What you don't know can and will kill you.  This is not a matter of the 
<br>
precautionary principle.  This is me, a specific person, standing here and 
<br>
telling you:  &quot;You see this thing right here that you don't understand? 
<br>
That's going to kill you.&quot;  Perhaps you think I am wrong.  Perhaps I am 
<br>
wrong.  Please do not go ahead until you understand *that thing* well 
<br>
enough to say *exactly* why it won't kill you.
<br>
<p>I repeat:  Do not mess around.  This is not a game.
<br>
