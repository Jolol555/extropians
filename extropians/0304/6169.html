<em>&gt;It turns out that, according to what I read, the main reason that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Houston is the great counter-example.
</em><br>
<p><p>You are behind the times.  Yes, in many of the older parts of
<br>
Houston, there are no zoning laws, and so there are some odd looking
<br>
houses in those areas. But nowadays most of the land (with ultilies)
<br>
here in the Houston Metro Area is part of one of the many Homeowners
<br>
Associations (HOA).  
<br>
<p>These quasigovernmental agencies are mechanisms through which is
<br>
accomplished those nasty ol' zero-sum games that many Extropians and
<br>
other libertarians insist are ineffective.  
<br>
<p>It is one of the oldest laws in animal socety--if you own something,
<br>
make sure no one else (or as few other als as possible) can own a copy
<br>
of it, and the value of yours will go up.  
<br>
<p>That is why in most of the Houston metro area, one can scarely vary
<br>
the landscaping without having the HOA come down hard on
<br>
offenders--let alone build high density housing.  Thus the price of
<br>
land and buildings have gone up in Houston...much to the delight of
<br>
those who already have such resources.  
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, those who do *not* &quot;have&quot; are usually too stupid (read
<br>
&quot;young&quot;) to realize what is going on.
