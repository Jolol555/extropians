<p>
Thanx Emlyn for this revealing qoute of Hermann Goering:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot; [...] the people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger. It works the  same way in any country.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Dirty old man, today he could easily take over the position of the resigned
<br>
Richard Perle. May his bones by now have rotten and completely melted
<br>
into the ground whereever they lie. I do not even want to know where.
<br>
<p>But Schweinebacke Goering forgot to mention one important thing.
<br>
Brainwashing must also function on the homecoming level, where brides and
<br>
women and mothers burst into tears but do not accuse the war commander in
<br>
chief of having abused their sons but repeat the standardized clichés of
<br>
praising their sons as heros who have defended American borders some 8000
<br>
miles away, put the blame for the deaths of their beloved on Saddam,
<br>
accentuate the necessitiy of unconditional support of the troops, pray for
<br>
them, be proud of America and ... of course: ask God to bless America, some
<br>
of them even thinking of America as being female.
<br>
<p>This is the true embarrassing and disgusting climax of brainwashing. Hermann
<br>
Georing would have been proud of achieving this peak of abusing his folks
<br>
himself.
