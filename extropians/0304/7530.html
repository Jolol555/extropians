The United Nations: Unfit to govern

<br>
<p>Iraq: Should the UN have &quot;a&quot; vital role, as Messrs. Bush and Blair 
<br>
have suggested? Or should it have &quot;the&quot; vital role, as M. Chirac is 
<br>
demanding?
<br>
<p>If you want the short answer to that question, consider the matter of 
<br>
whether UN sanctions should now be lifted, so that Iraqis can sell 
<br>
their oil and start rebuilding their country. Here is the official 
<br>
Russian response:
<br>
<p>&quot;This decision cannot be automatic,&quot; says the Foreign Minister with a 
<br>
straight face. &quot;For the Security Council to take this decision, we 
<br>
need to be certain whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction or 
<br>
not.&quot;
<br>
<p>Got that? Last month, the Russians were opposed to war on the grounds 
<br>
that there was no proof Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. This 
<br>
month, the Russians are opposed to lifting sanctions on the grounds 
<br>
that there's no proof Iraq doesn't have weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<p>There are a few striped-pants masochists in the State Department who 
<br>
enjoy this sort of thing and have spent the last four weeks pining 
<br>
for M. Chirac to walk all over them in steel-tipped stilettos one 
<br>
more time. But most Americans, given a choice between being locked in 
<br>
Security Council negotiations with the Russians, French and Germans 
<br>
or being fed feet-first into one of Saddam's industrial shredders, 
<br>
would find it a tough call.
<br>
<p>You don't have to be a genius to see that, since September 11th, we 
<br>
have entered a transitional phase in world affairs. But reasonable 
<br>
people are prone to reasonableness and, as I mentioned the other day, 
<br>
they're especially vulnerable to the seductive power of inertia in 
<br>
human affairs. The wish not to have to update one's Rolodex burns 
<br>
fiercely in the political breast. Brent Scowcroft, George Bush Sr.'s 
<br>
National Security Advisor, wanted to stick with the Soviet Union even 
<br>
after the Politburo had given up on it. The European Union was 
<br>
committed to the preservation of Yugoslavia even when there had 
<br>
ceased to be a Yugoslavia to preserve. In the Middle East, clinging 
<br>
to the status quo even as it's melting and dripping on to your shoes 
<br>
is one reason why the region is now a problem. You may recall G. W. 
<br>
Hunt's famous 19th-century London music-hall song, the one that 
<br>
introduced a new word for the kind of militant patriotism most 
<br>
distasteful to the enlightened soul:
<br>
<p>&quot;We don't want to fight, but, by jingo if we do,
<br>
<p>We've got the ships, we've got the men,
<br>
<p>we've got the money too ...&quot;
<br>
<p>What's often overlooked is what all this flag-waving was in aid of:
<br>
<p>&quot;We've fought the bear before
<br>
<p>And while we're Britons true
<br>
<p>The Russians shall not have Constantinople.&quot;
<br>
<p>Why? Because the British coveted it? Not at all. Her Majesty's 
<br>
Government was interested in cherrypicking the odd isle and emirate 
<br>
-- Cyprus here, Oman there -- but, other than that, they were 
<br>
committed to maintaining the Ottoman Empire: all that jingoistic 
<br>
rabble-rousing not for British glory but just to keep some other 
<br>
fellows' simpleton sultan on his throne. The Middle East is in its 
<br>
present condition in part because the European powers kept propping 
<br>
up the Turkish Empire decades after it had ceased to be prop-up-able. 
<br>
It would have been much better for all concerned if Britain had got 
<br>
its hands on Syria, Mesopotamia and Arabia in the 1870s rather than 
<br>
four decades later. But, even in the later stages of the Great War, 
<br>
after the British had comprehensively sliced and diced Turkey from 
<br>
top to toe, London's official position was that somehow the Ottoman 
<br>
Empire should be glued back together and propped up till the next war.
<br>
<p>Now another Middle Eastern war has come and gone, and the 
<br>
bien-pensants are anxious that once again an obsolescent institution 
<br>
be glued back together and propped in position. This time it's the 
<br>
UN. The editors of Britain's Spectator concede it has more than its 
<br>
share of &quot;irritating do-gooders,&quot; but surely even that's a euphemism: 
<br>
The do-gooders are, in fact, do-badders. The &quot;oil-for-palaces&quot; 
<br>
program (as Tommy Franks calls it) is a grotesque boondoggle even by 
<br>
UN standards: It was good for bureaucrats, good for Saddam's European 
<br>
bankers, good for his British stooge George Galloway, but bad for the 
<br>
Iraqi people. A humanitarian operation meant to help a dictator's 
<br>
beleagured subjects has instead enriched the UN by over $1-billion 
<br>
(officially) in &quot;administrative&quot; costs. There's no oversight, no 
<br>
auditing, nothing most businesses would recognize as a legitimate 
<br>
invoice, and, although non-essential items can only be approved by 
<br>
the Secretary-General himself, Kofi Annan (Mister Legitimacy) has 
<br>
personally signed off on practically anything Saddam requested, 
<br>
including &quot;boats,&quot; from France.
<br>
<p>You don't have to agree (though I do) with George Jonas that the UN 
<br>
is a fully fledged member of the axis of evil to recognize that 
<br>
there's little point in going to war to install yet another branch 
<br>
office of UNSCAM. If the problem is America's image in the Arab 
<br>
world, in what way does it help to confine the Stars and Stripes 
<br>
brand to unpleasant things like bombs while insisting all the nice 
<br>
post-war reconstructive stuff be clearly labelled with the UN flag? 
<br>
If the answer is that that's the price you pay for healing the rift 
<br>
with Old Europe, that presupposes Old Europe is interested in healing 
<br>
it. Tony Blair may be keen, but the Continentals have different 
<br>
agendas. Will the Belgian government approve the complaint against 
<br>
Tommy Franks for &quot;genocide&quot;? The petition accuses the General of 
<br>
&quot;inaction in the face of hospital pillaging,&quot; which apparently meets 
<br>
the Belgian definition of genocide. Unlike the deaths of over three 
<br>
million people, which is the lowball figure for those who've died in 
<br>
the current civil war in the Congo -- or, as I still like to think of 
<br>
it, the Belgian Congo.
<br>
<p>The Congo's civil war is everything the NIONists (Not In Our Name) 
<br>
claimed Bush's war would be: There were more civilian deaths in a few 
<br>
hours in Ituri province last week than in the entire Iraq campaign; 
<br>
while the blowhards at Oxfam and co -- the Big Consciences lobby -- 
<br>
insist on pretending that Iraq is a humanitarian disaster, there's an 
<br>
actual humanitarian disaster going on in the Congo, complete with 
<br>
millions of children dead from disease and malnutrition. While the 
<br>
lefties warned that Ariel Sharon would use the cover of the Iraq war 
<br>
to slaughter the Palestinians, the Congolese are being slaughtered, 
<br>
and you don't need any cover. Because nobody cares. Because no 
<br>
arrogant Americans or sinister Zionists are involved.
<br>
<p>The Congo is a useful reminder of the laziness of the term &quot;Western 
<br>
imperialism.&quot; There's Belgian imperialism, which, as the Congo 
<br>
continues to demonstrate, is a sewer. And then there's Anglo-Saxon 
<br>
nation-building, which, from India to Belize, works quite well, given 
<br>
the chance. St Lucia, Mauritius, Tuvalu and Papua New Guinea, to 
<br>
pluck four at random, have enjoyed the attributes of a free society a 
<br>
lot longer than, say, Greece, Portugal and Spain, which were 
<br>
dictatorships a quarter-century ago. The argument of my old friend 
<br>
Ghazi Algosaibi, the Saudi Minister of Water, that freedom is 
<br>
&quot;European&quot; is not borne out by the facts. If Latin Americans, Pacific 
<br>
islanders, and even the Muslims of south Asia can live in liberty, 
<br>
it's surely a little racist to suggest that Arabs are uniquely 
<br>
incapable of so doing. Had Britain begun administering Mesopotamia in 
<br>
1877 instead of 1917, we wouldn't even be asking the question.
<br>
<p>But if you want to turn a long-shot into a surefire failure, there's 
<br>
no better way than handing post-war Iraq from the Americans to the UN 
<br>
-- the successors to the Belgian school of nation-building. At best, 
<br>
you'll end up with Cambodia, where the UN has colluded in the 
<br>
nullification of democracy, or the Balkans, where once-functioning 
<br>
jurisdictions are reduced to the level of geopolitical tenements with 
<br>
the UN as slum landlord in perpetuity. At worst, you'll wind up with 
<br>
the West Bank &quot;refugee&quot; &quot;camps,&quot;the most extreme reminder of how the 
<br>
UN has little interest in solving problems, only in establishing 
<br>
bureaucracies to manage them. Washington should ignore the French, 
<br>
dare the Russians to veto, let the Iraqis turn on the spigots, and 
<br>
pay no attention to &quot;do-gooders.&quot;
