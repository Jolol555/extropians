<em>&gt; There's an annoying review in this month's Wired magazine by David
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gelernter of a book called Enough by Bill McKibben, opposing the ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of genetic engineering, designer babies, and posthumans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/play.html?pg=3">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/play.html?pg=3</a>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gelernter is probably best known for being a victim of the Unabomber.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I know him from his book that probably brought him to 
<br>
the Unabomber's attention, &quot;Mirror Worlds&quot;.  Many of his ideas 
<br>
are quite brilliant.  Unfortunately he locked away some of the 
<br>
most useful ones (life-streams for instance) in patents 
<br>
belonging to a single company that has done basically nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In what is perhaps a strange, virtual version of Stockholm Syndrome,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here he is advocating views which are very much in keeping with Ted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kaczynski's view of the world.  In this glowing review (he even refers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the book's writing as &quot;luminous&quot;), Gelernter can't say enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the horrors of genetic technology used to improve health and intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and physical vigor, nor call supporters of the technology too many names.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Arrogance&quot;, &quot;crime against humanity&quot;, &quot;control lust&quot;, &quot;naked nihilism&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even James Watson, mockingly called &quot;His Eminence&quot;, is given disparaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment, his quote taken out of context.  Gelernter concludes by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving a vote of confidence to the Bible as a guide to the difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological choices ahead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Does he then now believe that the Unabomber was simply his 
<br>
punishment for his &quot;arrogance&quot; and &quot;crime against humanity&quot;?  In 
<br>
any case this is a sad deterioration of a great mind.
<br>
<p>Admittedly though, the Unabomber, while utterly repulsively 
<br>
despicable in his methods, had some very legitimate worries 
<br>
about what advancing technology can lead to given the nature and 
<br>
proclivities of human beings.  Some days I think only Eliezer's 
<br>
FAI can possibly work.
