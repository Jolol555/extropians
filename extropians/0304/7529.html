<p>No it is not. I am simply using the word &quot;adapted&quot; according to its concise
<br>
definition as it relates to evolution. It is impossible for an organism to
<br>
be genetically adapted to an environment in which it did not evolve.
<br>
Adaptation is a process that happens only in the context of an environment.
<br>
<p>Eliezer doesn't read my messages carefully, else he would have known all
<br>
along that I do not reject improvements on the paleodiet from nutritional
<br>
and medical science, i.e., he does not realize or acknowledge that I *agree*
<br>
with him that humans may be better suited (but not better adapted) to other
<br>
environments. It seems you and at least one other person here are also under
<br>
the same false impression about my views, despite my numerous attempts to
<br>
clarify. 
<br>
<p>My advocacy of natural paleolithic diets should not be construed to mean
<br>
that I am advocating a Luddite point of view, or that I am anti-science. All
<br>
arguments along such lines are BS.
