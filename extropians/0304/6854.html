<p>Not quite.  A nation like France or Germany - or for
<br>
that matter, Brazil, Australia, or South Africa -
<br>
would
<br>
also be off limits to us.  It's not *just* the
<br>
powerful
<br>
military and industrial base, it's how one gets such.
<br>
Consider that, for all of China's modern repression,
<br>
it
<br>
is not presently as bad as Iraq was two months ago,
<br>
and
<br>
it is showing further signs of progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even with our current fairly sophisticated level of

</em><br>
<p>Funny you should mention that.  A bunch of the weapons
<br>
deployed in Gulf War I were designed on lessons
<br>
learned
<br>
in Vietnam.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if they did not get massive outside assistance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still doubt we could avoid being utterly worn down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by guerilla tactics combined with the dense jungle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrain which gives such great cover for them.
</em><br>
<p>There is some truth to that, but I point you to the
<br>
guerilla tactics some Saddam loyalists used in the
<br>
past month, in urban combat.  It's effective, but not
<br>
insurmountable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But they might gain access to battle armor of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own, and use quantity vrs. quality, though this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not hold up for them.  And cheap but plentiful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robot drones might also be used by them, possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even acquired by capturing some of those we deployed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against them.
</em><br>
<p>You'll note that Iraqi forces had tanks, and
<br>
apparently
<br>
more tanks than we deployed.  It is true that quantity
<br>
has a quality all its own, but the operative military
<br>
term is &quot;force multiplier&quot;.  As in: one person,
<br>
properly equipped (mentally and physically), can be
<br>
the
<br>
equal or better of any number of poor quality troops.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would rather that the U.S. never fights another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war, but if it did, I would like to see a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jungle conflict where we could further dispel the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ghosts of Vietnam by defeating a determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combatant who uses the strategies and tactics which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked so well for the Vietnamese communists.
</em><br>
<p>All cards on the table: the reason I was musing about
<br>
this in the first place was thinking about the worst
<br>
case scenarios for a lunar colony.  An outbreak of
<br>
armed violence, or an armed invasion, would certainly
<br>
be bad, but it is perhaps not as likely as certain
<br>
more
<br>
technical problems, like life support malfunction.
<br>
Still, it was interesting to think how a military used
<br>
to Earth conflicts would even go about assaulting a
<br>
single giant underground building, assuming it was
<br>
self-sufficient enough they could not simply siege it
<br>
(which would necessitate underground power plants -
<br>
lunathermal, if that would be viable, otherwise
<br>
nuclear - so the invaders could not simply deactivate
<br>
the solar power plants feeding the colony), and the
<br>
colony did not have space defenses enough to destroy
<br>
any unidentified incoming vehicle (which would itself
<br>
be an undesirable outcome, but that's another
<br>
scenario).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do the rest of you think?
