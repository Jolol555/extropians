<p><em>&gt;There is a new book that I hope some people on this list
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;light on the paradoxes of the current world political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation.  The book is &quot;World on Fire&quot;, by Amy Chua.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The author, if anything, appears slightly more liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than conservative, but certainly is not following any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideology.  Probably not coincidentally, if I'm right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about this book:  because new paradigms of course don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fit prior preconceptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The book's subtitle is &quot;How Exporting Free Market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The author is a professor at Yale Law School, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traveled extensively, and &quot;lectures frequently on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effects of globalization to government, business, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;academic groups around the world&quot;.  She's also a native

<em>&gt;(of Chinese descent) of the Philippines, and in my opinion

</em><br>
<p><p>i.e., not suffering from &quot;white guilt.&quot;  Yes, the folks at vdare.com

are very interested in her book:

<p>It appears you are in good company, Lee!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  From her accounts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's obvious that she's held innumerable discussions with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people living in all these different developing nations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The first four chapters are fascinating alone for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descriptions of the conditions and politics in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries around the world, from Southeast Asia to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Latin America and Africa.  She definitely has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;touch of an anthropologist!   I think that she does
</em><br>
<p>Political anthropologist....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;an outstanding job getting inside both the undeveloped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries, and the minds of their peoples around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The second four chapters concern &quot;The Political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Consequences of Globalization&quot;, and include the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;backlash and the counter-backlash to globalization's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effects; together the first eight chapters lay the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groundwork for the following introduction to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last four chapters of the book:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   The global spread of free market democracy has thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   been a principal, aggravating cause of ethnic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   instability and violence throughout the non-Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   world.  In country after country outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   West---from Mandalay to Moscow, from Jakarta to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Nairobi---laissez-fair markets have magnified the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   often astounding wealth and economic prominence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   an &quot;outsider&quot; minority, generating great reservoirs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of ethnic envy and resentment among the impoverished
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;indigenous&quot; majority.
</em><br>
<p>Shades of Nazi Germany!  We saw it first here in the West....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  In absolute terms the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   majority may actually be marginally better off as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   result of markets---this was true, for example, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Indonesia and most of the Sounteast Asian countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   in the 1980s and 1990s---but these small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   improvements are overwhelmed by the majority's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   continuing poverty and the hated minority's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   extraordinary economic success, invariably including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   their control of the &quot;crown jewels&quot; of the economy.
</em><br>
<p><p>Envy, that old, greenback-eyed monster...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;   Democracy, sadly, does not quell this resentment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   On the contrary, democratization, by increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   political voice and power of the &quot;indigenous&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   majority, has fostered the emergence of demagogues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   ---like Zimbabwe's Mugabe, Serbia's Milosevic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Russia's Zyuganov, Bolivia's Great Condor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Rwanda's Hutu Power leaders---who opportunistically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   whip up mass hatred against the resented minority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   demanding that the country's wealth be returned to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   the &quot;true owners of the nation.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p><p>a la Hitler...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As a result, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   its raw, for-export form, the pursuit of free market
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   democracy outside the West has repeatedly led not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   widespread peace and prosperity, but to ethnic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   confiscation, authoritarian backlash, and mass killing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   What does al this have to do with the West?  Is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   non-Western world perhaps just hopeless---too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   divided, backward, and violent to sustain free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   market democracy?  Perhaps the United States and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   other Western nations should simply wash their hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   of underdeveloped societies and their intractable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   horrendous problems.  In the end, what do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   market-dominant minorities and ethnonationalism have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to do with us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Actually, they have everything to do with us.  Or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   this final part of the book will argue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   The next four chapters will show that the explosive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   confrontation between a market-dominant minority and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   an aroused ethno-nationalist majority is by no means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   limited to the non-Western world.  On the contrary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   this confrontation lurks beneath some of the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   violent, abominable episodes of Western history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Moreover, even today this explosive dynamic is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   confined to individual developing countries.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   being played out at regional and global levels in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   ways that directly affect the Western nations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   particularly the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I very much want to see this viewpoint criticized; also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even if she's exactly right, it's hardly clear what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consequently the best course of action would be.  (I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not gotten to what, if any recommendations she has yet.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee
</em><br>
<p><p>Yep, the lamb never really did lie down with the lion....
