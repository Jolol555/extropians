<p>Gts, I say again that you are making the classic Panglossian error, which 
<br>
is very well known to evolutionary theorists.  Living organisms are 
<br>
adapted to the environments in which they evolved.  That is, when living 
<br>
organisms adapt, they adapt to their environments, rather than something 
<br>
else.  It does not follow that an organism is &quot;best adapted&quot; or even &quot;well 
<br>
adapted&quot; to that environment.  An organism that has been adapted by 
<br>
natural selection for a constant diet, and choosing a diet which is the 
<br>
best fuel for that organism, are two different optimization problems.  The 
<br>
diet that is best suited to an organism that adapted to a paleolithic diet 
<br>
is not necessarily a paleolithic diet.  There are valid arguments for the 
<br>
paleolithic precautionary principle but the one you are using is a logical 
<br>
non-sequitur.  It could as easily be used to prove the harmfulness of 
<br>
bathing, antibiotics or air-conditioning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you argue with a talking giraffe who told you that he thought his long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neck was for eating the leaves of tall trees? Would you ask him if he was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Luddite if he insisted that the leaves of tall trees should be the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staple of his diet? 
</em><br>
<p>The second statement does not follow from the first.  The second statement 
<br>
may be *true*, but the first statement is not what it follows from.
