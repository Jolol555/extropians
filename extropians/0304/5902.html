<p>Yes.  It's considered good form in many quarters to
<br>
substitute correct emotions for rational denunciation.

<em>&gt; &gt; No, they're not.  I don't consider any of those individuals

<em>&gt; &gt; to be racists.  I do disagree with Pat Buchanan about a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The word &quot;racist&quot; is a cliche, and is therefore useless as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool for discussion of issues.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think that *racism* should continue to mean what the
<br>
dictionary says, namely, (1) The belief that race accounts
<br>
for differences in human character or ability and that a
<br>
particular race is superior to others.  [Note the very important
<br>
word &quot;and&quot;]  (2) Discrimination or prejudice based on race. 
<br>
<p>But you are correct in that many words, such as &quot;racist&quot;,
<br>
&quot;communist&quot;, &quot;fascist&quot;, are frequently used in a context
<br>
to describe people who would not describe themselves that
<br>
way, and who, technically speaking, have justification for
<br>
not doing so.  In this case, it's either name-calling or
<br>
ad hominem (Harvey made the distinction clear, but I forget),
<br>
and adds nothing to a discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the story of the Emmett Till incident:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html">http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I didn't see anything about &quot;sexual harassment at all&quot;.  Looked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just like an old-fashioned lynching.
</em><br>
<p>But you can have the last word,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not sure what the incident discussed here is about, but vdare generally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sticks its nose into socially taboo areas, such immigration (its main 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern), multicultural diversity, race, etc.  That is what I love about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vdare--they address issues that political correctness has deemed out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bounds for political discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sheep can only lob pre-programmed ad homs.  Wannabe posthumans actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seek out discussion of important issues that society at large ignores.
