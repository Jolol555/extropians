</em><br>
<p>One needs a certain amount of specialized machinery.
<br>
DNA synthesizers and sequencers &amp; PCR apparatus to
<br>
amplify DNA for example -- these range from a few thousand
<br>
to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Then one needs very
<br>
high quality water purifiers and sterilizers.  Finally one
<br>
needs the reagents to perform the actual &quot;engineering&quot; --
<br>
a small amount of a single restriction enzyme to cut
<br>
up a piece of DNA in a specific place may be a few
<br>
hundred dollars (and there are hundreds of different
<br>
kinds of restriction enzymes that one might need to use).
<br>
Then there are the plastic consumables -- tubes or plates
<br>
in which to grow you modified organisms.
<br>
<p>It isn't cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Might it not be simpler just to design a virus to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this infection, but not replicate (beyond normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell division, et cetera), then flood the body with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of this virus?
</em><br>
<p>This involves placing the virus in a host which has been
<br>
engineered to have the required additional replication
<br>
machinery -- not simple (otherwise how do you get a
<br>
sufficient number of viruses?).  Then there is a nasty
<br>
problem that you don't introduce any of the cells that
<br>
are capable of replicating the virus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One challenge would be how to make sure the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virus does not needlessly overwrite the edit on a cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that has already been modified, or at least that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an overwrite would be harmless.
</em><br>
<p>Yes -- this is the &quot;How many copies do you want problem?&quot;.
<br>
There are some solutions for this in prokaryotic cells
<br>
with bacterial viruses but I'm unaware of any that function
<br>
within eukaryotic cells.  With their much larger size it
<br>
might be difficult for the regulatory proteins to diffuse
<br>
sufficiently fast to perform the desired function (of
<br>
regulating copy number).
<br>
<p>I've thought about this for a long time and haven't managed to come up
<br>
with a good solution (which is why I suggested delivering single
<br>
pre-engineered secondary nuclei [biobots] outside of the body). One can
<br>
always screen such cells to make sure you are getting those with the
<br>
correct modifications. Inside the body it is much more difficult to make
<br>
sure things are going as planned.
