<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I have always thought that the basic premise that diversity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is inherently beneficial is flawed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There's not conflict here.  Homogeneous environments are, when well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adapted, more efficient (allowing for requisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specializations).  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are excessively vulnerable to even slight variations in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment.  And they provide fertile ground for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; predator, be it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; virus or a meme (or anything else).  So there is a trade off between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; short term and long term benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution only works to develop improvements by diversity.  
</em><br>
<p>That must explain all those lambs that are part of all lion prides these days.
<br>
Come to think of it, you are absolutely right! I have *never* seen any animal 
<br>
group composed of only ONE type of animal. For example, every antelope herd 
<br>
has a large contingent of tortoises, and every elephant troop I have ever 
<br>
seen has at least 10% rhinos and 10% baboons. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Capitalism only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develops better products by diversity.  
</em><br>
<p>How true. I have never seen a firm improve its competitive position by 
<br>
focusing on just one product.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Think tanks only think up new ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by diversity.  
</em><br>
<p>Exactly! And that is exactly why all the think tanks have jettisoned their 
<br>
past policies of only hiring degreed people, and have started hiring half 
<br>
their faculty from the non-degreed homeless street person population.  Out 
<br>
with the Ivy League degrees, in with the 10th grade dropout, ex-con winos.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Human thought,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art, philosophy, and creative thought only occur because of diversity.  
</em><br>
<p>Exactly! That is why every successful artist, philosopher and thinker only 
<br>
devotes a small fraction of their lives to artistry, philosophy 
<br>
and &quot;thinking.&quot; The rest of the time they do things like work at the post 
<br>
office and rollerblade at the mall on weekends. 
<br>
<p>Diversity! It's everywhere!
