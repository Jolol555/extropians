<p>Sure.  But there's nutrients and nutrients.  Is taking lots of protein good?
<br>
I've seen signs it isn't -- gout, calcium competition, kidney stones.  And
<br>
where do free radicals come from, metabolically?  Are the &quot;empty calories&quot; of
<br>
carbs a cleaner burning fuel than protein, without by-products gumming up the
<br>
works?
<br>
<p>I'm just throwing out questions here, not asserting anything.
<br>
<p>Maybe the Okinawan success come from pure calories + lots of antioxidants and
<br>
stuff + plus some (not much) good protein and fat from fish, with a touch of
<br>
calorie restriction.
<br>
<p>Seems like Americans were getting fat on steak and potatoes, then tried to go
<br>
low-fat and got even fatter and more diabetic.  People conclude carbs are bad,
<br>
but the Americans were also eating *more*, which might be the real problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Grape juice or whole wheat bread: which would you rather live on?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One cannot live on either of these foods alone. 
</em><br>
<p>I did always say grains weren't complete, didn't I?  But fruits tend not to be
<br>
either, and I suspect you'd last longer on the bread.
