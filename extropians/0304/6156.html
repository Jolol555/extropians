From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Predictable%20catastrophes%20of%20human%20stupidity">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And now, having earned goodwill, watch as the Bush administration blows it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all on a series of sheerly stupid and arrogant moves that turn every Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against us and permanently sours the whole Middle East on democracy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America.
</em><br>
<p>^^^^^^^^^Yes, I agree that this will happen, but I don't think it will all
<br>
be Bush's fault. I haven't seen (and I wasn't on the list for several days,
<br>
so possibly I missed it) anyone mention that the liberation in Iraq extends
<br>
almost wholly to the *men* of Iraq and not it's women. My point is that
<br>
Islam does not allow for real liberty or for real democracy.  America has
<br>
gotten itself, rightly or misguidedly, into a real quagmire. Getting out of
<br>
Iraq and leaving it in a better socio-political climate than it was under
<br>
Hussein is not going to be easy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want also to point out that the Shiite cleric Khoei who was murdered
<br>
by Iraqi's, and whom the USA backed (according to the news), was not a
<br>
friend to the USA.  The USA has a history of supporting and empowering new
<br>
leadership (e.g. Qadhdhafi of Libya) over their predecessors and having
<br>
these new leaders turn out to be very poor choices. I am afraid that the USA
<br>
is going to make such a mistake again in Iraq. The USA support of Khoei is
<br>
fueling my fears.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw or read in the news a few days ago that Khoei supported the USA.
<br>
That is just not true. Khoei, according to information from the same news
<br>
sources, simply told his followers not to interfere. However, this is in
<br>
keeping with very strict Muslim tradition. He would not support the USA by
<br>
asking his followers to kill other Muslims; most especially not to fight on
<br>
the side of the satanic USA.  I believe, based on my many years of
<br>
experience with the Muslim community, that if Khoei had been in power in
<br>
place of Hussein, then we would find that he was as anywhere from as open
<br>
and loving as Ayatollah Khamenei to as sweet and charitable as Bin Laden.
