<em>&gt; The key point is that, from a paleodieter's perspective, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *burden of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof* is always on those who would deviate from the default
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paleodiet. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a question of who has the burden of proof.
</em><br>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how often debates on the Internet lead to the
<br>
argument over &quot;burden of proof.&quot;  I can't imagine taking a &quot;default&quot;
<br>
position without having evidence and just assuming my position is right
<br>
until someone proves me wrong.  I certainly wouldn't debate it on the
<br>
Internet or try to convince others of my position without evidence.  I even
<br>
question the assumption that most people have that &quot;the way it has always
<br>
been&quot; is necessarily best or even acceptable.  A lot of things that have
<br>
&quot;always been that way&quot; are just plain detestable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example it is not for paleodieters to prove that dairy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and agricultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products are unnecessary and not valuable to the diet. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burden of proof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is rather on those who say dairy and agricultural; products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and valuable additions to the diet.
</em><br>
<p>Why is either one more &quot;default&quot; than the other?  Virtually everybody in
<br>
modern America eats dairy products.  Why wouldn't this be the default, and
<br>
the burden of proof be on those who want to change the standard diet.  Why
<br>
would anybody insist that dairy is not valuable without evidence?  Why would
<br>
anybody insist that dairy is valuable without evidence?
<br>
<p>And personally, I can't imagine anybody arguing *history* as evidence.  Why
<br>
not scientifically define requirements for a good diet and then measure
<br>
dairy products for how well they fill those needs?  Or scientifically
<br>
determine what is detrimental for a good diet and then measure dairy
<br>
products for those undesirable substances?  Or just feed various diets to
<br>
animals and see which ones work better?  Or do surveys of humans on
<br>
different diets to see how they are faring?
<br>
<p>The anti-science subtext of these discussions is very disturbing to see on
<br>
the Extropians list.  Nutrition and body functions are a modern subset of
<br>
biochemistry.  I don't see why science is being ignored as an obvious tool
<br>
here.  I know it has been mentioned that nutritional &quot;science&quot; is bogus, but
<br>
I think that applies more to pop science and pseudo-science.  Biochemistry,
<br>
medicine and nutritional specialties are respectable and highly supportable
<br>
scientific disciplines.
