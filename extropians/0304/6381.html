<p><em>&gt; To clarify: we fortify dairy products with D to prevent *rickets*, and we

</em><br>
<p>While I don't know the history of pellagra, I think beriberi (B1 deficiency)
<br>
was discovered by chickens eating white rice and dying.  We enrich refined
<br>
grains, yes, because they need it because we've taken the nutrients they had
<br>
away.  But that doesn't mean the grains are bad, vs. how we treat them.
<br>
<p>The Joy of Cooking mentioned some experiment where rats, given a surplus of
<br>
grain, ate the germ and left the rest, vs. modern Americans leaving the germ
<br>
and eating the rest.  This does suggest the rats prefer to avoid the purer
<br>
starch given a choice, but also that there's something there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Notice that we fortify both food categories artificially to make them   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthwhile components of the American diet. They have little intrinsic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value.
</em><br>
<p>Baby mammals multiply their weight a few times on milk.  How can you say it
<br>
has little value?  They're not just fattening up, they're building everything
<br>
in their body.  The milk may be unhealthy for us -- saturated fat, or
<br>
evolutionary taboos -- but saying it lacks value is ridiculous.
<br>
<p>Vitamin D doesn't come from any food; we make it with sunlight.  If kids
<br>
weren't getting out enough, or if they lacked the dietary precursor, adding it
<br>
to something would make sense.  Milk would be a candidate not because of its
<br>
value, which is irrelevant, but because it was drunk a lot, making it a good
<br>
pathway into the diet.  As it happens vit D is connected to calcium uptake,
<br>
making adding it to milk fairly logical.  But if you ate lots of spinach but
<br>
got no sun I think you'd still have a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; meats and nuts. Breads and pasta are ~50% carb (i.e., ~50% sugar) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to other carb containing foods like fruits and veggies they have
</em><br>
<p>Fruits are pretty much sugar bombs with extras too.  Veggies pass my 2000
<br>
calories test, but lots of fruits don't look so good: you'd need 9000 calories
<br>
of apples to get enough protein.  Bananas and oranges are better, I think.
<br>
Vitamins, fiber, random chemicals, yes, complete food no... thus dietary
<br>
cautions saying that when they recommend 5 servings of &quot;fruit or vegetable a
<br>
day&quot; they don't mean just 5 servings of fruit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay, but you'll have to grant me this much: if the term &quot;empty calories&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has any meaning beyond simple sugar then grains are it. 
</em><br>
<p>Grape juice or whole wheat bread: which would you rather live on?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Not flour, breaking up seed cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's flour.
</em><br>
<p>I checked again, and you're right.  Ground into meal, mixed with water, either
<br>
eaten raw or baked.  Going back at least 15,000 years.
