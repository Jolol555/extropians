<em>&gt; I like to believe this, but I am not sure that this

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, an eternal blissful afterlife instead

</em><br>
<p>Actually, it tends to make people strive for that
<br>
afterlife instead of upgrading themselves and their
<br>
leaders in the real world.  I offer as evidence the
<br>
very publicized majority position of religious leaders
<br>
towards science and engineering, both now and through
<br>
at least the Middle Ages.  (Note I said *majority*.
<br>
There are certainly some religious leaders who are
<br>
unabashedly in favor of discovering the truth of what
<br>
we are and extending human capability, and for
<br>
treating
<br>
the results of said projects as human if they act
<br>
human, among other examples.  Just not that many.)
<br>
Counter-meme: &quot;Heaven on Earth - shall we build it,
<br>
and
<br>
live here forever?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be more efficient to steal technology as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invented by others rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than having to expend resources to actually invent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stuff.
</em><br>
<p>In terms of total physical resources spent, it is.
<br>
However, those who do the inventing get to use it
<br>
first
<br>
- and they're often on to the next big thing by the
<br>
time you're done stealing and mastering their last
<br>
invention.  Time is an often overlooked type of
<br>
capital, perhaps because it plays by rules rather
<br>
different from most other types.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately, it may also turn out that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier to sabotage those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pull ahead rather than expending resources to catch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up and surpass them.
</em><br>
<p>For large projects, yes.  See what the bioethicists
<br>
have done for biotech: chased it into smaller, harder
<br>
to track projects...and overseas, beyond their reach.
<br>
However, organizations that tend towards this kind of
<br>
behavior also tend to neglect their own research, and
<br>
technology still moots them in the end; it just takes
<br>
a
<br>
bit longer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may just be a position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith on our parts that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the good guys always win and the bad guys always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose.  (But I hope not.)
</em><br>
<p>This thread is about offering evidence to try to prove
<br>
that hypothesis,  or at least make a more conscious
<br>
decision about how likely it is, rather than just
<br>
taking it on faith.
