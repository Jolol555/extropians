<em>&gt; With respect to &quot;burden-of-proof table tennis&quot;, the main bone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of contention here, the burden of proof is always on those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who would challenge the status quo, i.e., it is always on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who would offer some new theory that they think should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better explain the empirical data. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With respect to this thread, my point is simply that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to me and other people who embrace paleodiet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, paleodiet theory really ought to be the null 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (working) hypothesis for optimal diet.
</em><br>
<p>That's fine for you, gts, but it doesn't convince me.
<br>
<p>If you want to convince someone else, you always have to present
<br>
enough data to overcome their own existing belief.
<br>
<p>My belief, founded on the latest and largest studies of the
<br>
correlation between diet and health, is that a diet of infrequent lean
<br>
meat, low saturated fat, lots of fruits and vegetables, and a
<br>
reasonable amount of high-fiber whole grains is the best we know of in
<br>
terms of longevity.
<br>
<p>To support my claims I can point to substantial data collected in the
<br>
/current environment/.
<br>
<p>To support the paleo diet you have two things:
<br>
<p>1) An application of evolutionary theory which I find extremely
<br>
questionable.  (Our paleolithic ancestors almost never experienced
<br>
aging, so why would we think that their diet was optimized for slowing
<br>
down the aging process.)
<br>
<p>2) Historical data on the decreased health of early farmers vs. the
<br>
hunter-gatherers that immediately preceded them.
<br>
<p>Frankly, I find #2 far more convincing than #1.  And with #2 there are
<br>
still many confounding factors: farming led to greater population
<br>
density which increased disease; early farmers may have eaten a
<br>
smaller variety of food than today; the first farmed-versions of many
<br>
foodstuffs lacked many of the qualities we've bred into them over the
<br>
past several thousand years; etc...
<br>
<p>So, basically, until you have a large amount of data /in the current
<br>
environment/ to back up your claims, they're just not going to be as
<br>
convincing as alternative claims that do have that large experimental
<br>
data backing.
