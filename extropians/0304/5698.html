<p>Yes.  Granted, it is almost always in contexts where
<br>
new information brings different values to the same
<br>
system of deductions, rather than where the system of
<br>
deductions was itself changed, but it has happened.
<br>
For example, I had been thinking cryonics was horribly
<br>
expensive, doomed to remain accessible only to the
<br>
idle rich; the facts, I have learned, are otherwise.
<br>
<p>The emotional debates tend to be unproductive, yes.
<br>
Stick to the facts, and you may convince people.
<br>
Stick to emotions, and you mainly preach to the choir.
<br>
(Unless of course the facts in question do involve
<br>
your emotions, such as when trying to convince someone
<br>
that something really is that valuable to you.)
<br>
<p>This gets muddied by the fact that many of the
<br>
professional opinion changers in our society place
<br>
much
<br>
faith in debating by emotion.  This, however, belies
<br>
the fact that they are often hired when the facts
<br>
alone
<br>
are not too convincing - and it also ignores the
<br>
specific techniques they use to manipulate emotions,
<br>
which tend to have higher success rates than merely
<br>
any
<br>
random appeal to emotion.  (Analogy: striking rocks to
<br>
strike a fire over a large area, vs. over a carefully
<br>
gathered, dried, and prepared bundle of kindling.  The
<br>
former may work; the latter works more often.)
