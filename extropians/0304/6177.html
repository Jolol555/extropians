Jay Dugger:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please remember military police count as a very small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subset of the military proper, and even then they exist to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce discipline within the military more than to do the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same sort of work as civilian law enforcement.
</em><br>
<p>While it is true that a normal division-sized element has only a slice
<br>
of military police, the rest of this statement is not true at all.
<br>
Military police are trained in all the normal police functions, and some
<br>
would say, since they are charged with law enforcement among armed
<br>
troops, they are trained to deal with contingencies normal police are
<br>
not. We're not at war most of the time and during peacetime, MPs drive
<br>
around in Ford sedans and civilian SUVs, respond to domestic
<br>
disturbances and set up RADAR traps like any other police force.
<br>
Military discipline problems look a lot like civilian crime (i.e., they
<br>
are usually the same thing). But that's not really the issue:    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Soldiers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Marines do not make very good police. They train with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very different tools and techniques for very different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ends. Expecting military servicemembers to keep order in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq isn't reasonable. 
</em><br>
<p>What special skills do police have that military troops do not? Normal
<br>
civilian police have some rudimentary knowledge of the law codified into
<br>
police procedure, but this can easily become military procedure in
<br>
certain circumstances. What else? Knowledge of local customs and
<br>
traditions can be learned. Knowledge of who the &quot;bad guys&quot; are comes
<br>
with experience. The tools are different? Well, the tools must match the
<br>
job and when the criminals carry Kalishnikovs, military tools look a lot
<br>
more effective than tasers, billy-clubs, and the 9mm. Different
<br>
techniques? Probably, but many police techniques are drawn directly from
<br>
the military's tried and true combat contingencies and can essentially
<br>
be boiled down to 'watch your flank and call for backup'. The US
<br>
military and the militaries of other countries have been doing police
<br>
missions in Panama, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan to name the
<br>
big ones. We still have troops in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. These
<br>
are almost entirely &quot;policing&quot; missions, with the notable exception of
<br>
recent Afghanistan military campaigns. Kosovo and Bosnia have even
<br>
proven to be relatively successful, no thanks to the corruption of the
<br>
UN's police in both locations.
<br>
<p>What good is law enforcement when no one knows what the law is? Military
<br>
troops with some intelligence are far more likely to restore a modicum
<br>
of order than any police force. 
<br>
