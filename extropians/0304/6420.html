</em><br>
<em>&gt;

Please do remember just how thoroughly those pictures were manipulated, 
<br>
and, mainly, selected.  Not that there's anything unusual about that.  
<br>
(If you've ever been at an event, and then later seen it reported on TV, 
<br>
or in the newspapers, you'll know what I mean.)
<br>
<p>The truth wears a thousand faces.  We can only survive by abstracting 
<br>
what is &quot;relevant&quot;.  But the one choosing what is relevant, does so for 
<br>
their reasons, and unless that's you, they aren't your reasons.  
<br>
(Usually the news is, or appears to be, processed for &quot;entertainment 
<br>
value&quot;.)
<br>
<p>The Iraqi minister of information may have done a lousy job, but the 
<br>
editors at CNN and Fox (and others) are much more highly skilled, and do 
<br>
the same job.  But they are sufficiently skilled, that it's hard to notice.
