<p>A Brief History of the Multiverse
<br>
<p>By PAUL DAVIES
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
YDNEY
<br>
Imagine you can play God and fiddle with the settings of the great cosmic 
<br>
machine. Turn this knob and make electrons a bit heavier; twiddle that one 
<br>
and make gravitation a trifle weaker. What would be the effect? The universe 
<br>
would look very different — so different, in fact, that there wouldn't be 
<br>
anyone around to see the result, because the existence of life depends rather 
<br>
critically on the actual settings that Mother Nature selected.
<br>
<p>Scientists have long puzzled over this rather contrived state of affairs. Why 
<br>
is nature so ingeniously, one might even say suspiciously, friendly to life? 
<br>
What do the laws of physics care about life and consciousness that they 
<br>
should conspire to make a hospitable universe? It's almost as if a Grand 
<br>
Designer had it all figured out.
<br>
<p>The fashionable scientific response to this cosmic conundrum is to invoke the 
<br>
so-called multiverse theory. The idea here is that what we have hitherto been 
<br>
calling &quot;the universe&quot; is nothing of the sort. It is but a small component 
<br>
within a vast assemblage of other universes that together make up a 
<br>
&quot;multiverse.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is but a small extra step to conjecture that each universe comes with its 
<br>
own knob settings. They could be random, as if the endless succession of 
<br>
universes is the product of the proverbial monkey at a typewriter. Almost all 
<br>
universes are incompatible with life, and so go unseen and unlamented. Only 
<br>
in that handful where, by chance, the settings are just right will life 
<br>
emerge; then beings such as ourselves will marvel at how propitiously 
<br>
fine-tuned their universe is.
<br>
<p>But we would be wrong to attribute this suitability to design. It is entirely 
<br>
the result of self-selection: we simply could not exist in biologically 
<br>
hostile universes, no matter how many there were.
<br>
<p>This idea of multiple universes, or multiple realities, has been around in 
<br>
philosophical circles for centuries. The scientific justification for it, 
<br>
however, is new.
<br>
<p>One argument stems from the &quot;big bang&quot; theory: according to the standard 
<br>
model, shortly after the universe exploded into existence about 14 billion 
<br>
years ago, it suddenly jumped in size by an enormous factor. This &quot;inflation&quot; 
<br>
can best be understood by imagining that the observable universe is, 
<br>
relatively speaking, a tiny blob of space buried deep within a vast labyrinth 
<br>
of interconnected cosmic regions. Under this theory, if you took a God's-eye 
<br>
view of the multiverse, you would see big bangs aplenty generating a tangled 
<br>
melee of universes enveloped in a superstructure of frenetically inflating 
<br>
space. Though individual universes may live and die, the multiverse is 
<br>
forever.
<br>
<p>Some scientists now suspect that many traditional laws of physics might in 
<br>
fact be merely local bylaws, restricted to limited regions of space. Many 
<br>
physicists now think that there are more than three spatial dimensions, for 
<br>
example, since certain theories of subatomic matter are neater in 9 or 10 
<br>
dimensions. So maybe three is a lucky number that just happened by accident 
<br>
in our cosmic neighborhood — other universes may have five or seven 
<br>
dimensions.
<br>
<p>Life would probably be impossible with more (or less) than three dimensions 
<br>
to work with, so our seeing three is then no surprise. Similar arguments 
<br>
apply to other supposedly fixed properties of the cosmos, such as the 
<br>
strengths of the fundamental forces or the masses of the various subatomic 
<br>
particles. Perhaps these parameters were all fluke products of cosmic luck, 
<br>
and our exquisitely friendly &quot;universe&quot; is but a minute oasis of fecundity 
<br>
amid a sterile space-time desert.
<br>
<p>How seriously can we take this explanation for the friendliness of nature? 
<br>
Not very, I think. For a start, how is the existence of the other universes 
<br>
to be tested? To be sure, all cosmologists accept that there are some regions 
<br>
of the universe that lie beyond the reach of our telescopes, but somewhere on 
<br>
the slippery slope between that and the idea that there are an infinite 
<br>
number of universes, credibility reaches a limit. As one slips down that 
<br>
slope, more and more must be accepted on faith, and less and less is open to 
<br>
scientific verification.
<br>
<p>Extreme multiverse explanations are therefore reminiscent of theological 
<br>
discussions. Indeed, invoking an infinity of unseen universes to explain the 
<br>
unusual features of the one we do see is just as ad hoc as invoking an unseen 
<br>
Creator. The multiverse theory may be dressed up in scientific language, but 
<br>
in essence it requires the same leap of faith.
<br>
<p>At the same time, the multiverse theory also explains too much. Appealing to 
<br>
everything in general to explain something in particular is really no 
<br>
explanation at all. To a scientist, it is just as unsatisfying as simply 
<br>
declaring, &quot;God made it that way!&quot;
<br>
<p>Problems also crop up in the small print. Among the myriad universes similar 
<br>
to ours will be some in which technological civilizations advance to the 
<br>
point of being able to simulate consciousness. Eventually, entire virtual 
<br>
worlds will be created inside computers, their conscious inhabitants unaware 
<br>
that they are the simulated products of somebody else's technology. For every 
<br>
original world, there will be a stupendous number of available virtual worlds 
<br>
— some of which would even include machines simulating virtual worlds of 
<br>
their own, and so on ad infinitum.
<br>
<p>Taking the multiverse theory at face value, therefore, means accepting that 
<br>
virtual worlds are more numerous than &quot;real&quot; ones. There is no reason to 
<br>
expect our world — the one in which you are reading this right now — to be 
<br>
real as opposed to a simulation. And the simulated inhabitants of a virtual 
<br>
world stand in the same relationship to the simulating system as human beings 
<br>
stand in relation to the traditional Creator.
<br>
<p>Far from doing away with a transcendent Creator, the multiverse theory 
<br>
actually injects that very concept at almost every level of its logical 
<br>
structure. Gods and worlds, creators and creatures, lie embedded in each 
<br>
other, forming an infinite regress in unbounded space.
<br>
<p>This reductio ad absurdum of the multiverse theory reveals what a very 
<br>
slippery slope it is indeed. Since Copernicus, our view of the universe has 
<br>
enlarged by a factor of a billion billion. The cosmic vista stretches one 
<br>
hundred billion trillion miles in all directions — that's a 1 with 23 zeros. 
<br>
Now we are being urged to accept that even this vast region is just a 
<br>
minuscule fragment of the whole.
<br>
<p>But caution is strongly advised. The history of science rarely repeats 
<br>
itself. Maybe there is some restricted form of multiverse, but if the concept 
<br>
is pushed too far, then the rationally ordered (and apparently real) world we 
<br>
perceive gets gobbled up in an infinitely complex charade, with the truth 
<br>
lying forever beyond our ken.
