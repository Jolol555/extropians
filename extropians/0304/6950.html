<p>Sure. Lee and I don't disagree on that point, at least for general purposes.
<br>
<p><p>Lee was objecting to the fact that I picked skinless turkey breast as an
<br>
example of &quot;lean meats&quot; in my post to samantha after she suggested that some
<br>
beans and greens (never specified by her) are richer sources of protein than
<br>
lean meats. Protein intake is measured in grams, so I made comparisons in
<br>
grams.
<br>
<p>Lee thinks I should have used a more general definition of turkey meat.
<br>
However this would include the fatty dark meat and the fatty skin, both of
<br>
which are distasteful to a significant percentage of people. Moreover the
<br>
point to which samantha was objecting concerned my statements about *lean
<br>
meats*. Skinless turkey breast is a superb example of lean meat, and one
<br>
that is appealing to practically any non-vegetarian. 
<br>
<p>Veggies look pretty good on a protein/calorie ratio but beans don't look so
<br>
good on that same scale. Beans tend to be rich in carbs.
<br>
<p>I wonder if people here realize that carbs are not even essential to the
<br>
human diet. 
<br>
<p>There are three main meta-nutrients: carbs, fats and proteins. Only fats and
<br>
proteins are essential in the human diet, which is not to say that I think a
<br>
diet with little or no carbs is optimal.
