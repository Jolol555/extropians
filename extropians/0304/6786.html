<p>Not to mention that such an argument says we don't really 
<br>
believe in free markets at all but only when such might be 
<br>
convenient to the current players.
<br>
<p>Also there is the small problem that the sanctions were imposed 
<br>
against a particular regime and its purported dangers when said 
<br>
regime is now defeated.  So on what grounds would we justify the 
<br>
continuance of sanctions?  I would think they would have to be 
<br>
arrived at on the basis of an entirely new argument much deeper 
<br>
than the economic convience of other players.
