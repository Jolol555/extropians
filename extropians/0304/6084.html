&quot;Super-Pneumonia&quot; or Super Scare?

<p>Excerpt -
<br>
<p>&quot;It is the worst medical disaster I have ever seen,&quot; the Dean of Medicine at
<br>
the Chinese University in Hong Kong told a prominent Asian newspaper. This
<br>
irresistible quote was then shot 'round the world by other media, seeking
<br>
desperately to hype the &quot;mysterious killer pneumonia&quot; or &quot;super-pneumonia.&quot;
<br>
But a bit of knowledge and perspective will kill this panic.
<br>
<p>Start with those scary tags. &quot;Mysterious&quot; in modern medicine usually means
<br>
we haven't yet quite identified the cause, although it appears we have now
<br>
done so here. What's been officially named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
<br>
(SARS) appears to be one or more strains of coronavirus, commonly associated
<br>
with colds.
<br>
<p>&quot;Killer pneumonia&quot; is practically a redundancy, since so many types of
<br>
pneumonia (there are over 50) do kill.
<br>
<p>The real questions are: How lethal, how transmissible, and how treatable is
<br>
this strain? And the answers leave no grounds for excitement, much less
<br>
panic. Super?
<br>
<p>At this writing, SARS appears to have killed 49 people out of 1323 afflicted
<br>
according to the World Health Organization, a death rate of less than four
<br>
percent. In Hong Kong, that alleged &quot;worst medical disaster&quot; has killed ten
<br>
people out of 316 known victims. But since this only takes into account
<br>
those ill enough to seek medical help, the actual ratio of deaths to
<br>
infections is certainly far less.
