<em>&gt; &gt; That some people have absolutely nothing positive to say of the United

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; degree to the United States. Yet some insist that merely because the US (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any other country) is powerful and in a dominant world position, than it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bad,  or &quot;might makes wrong&quot;, in huMania's words. This position too is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acceptable in any form to many on this list, and the record of the United 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; States as compared to other major world powers, most notably the Soviet Union 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or Nazi Germany, is a necessary part of illustrating why the position of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;might makes wrong&quot; is not appropriate in all cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yet... might does make wrong.  Monopolies are justly forbidden from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities that non-monopolists engage in without (much) censure for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just that reason.
</em><br>
<p>The whole issue of exactly how undesirable are economic monopolies
<br>
is a quite difficult question.  Some are very beneficial, it has
<br>
seemed.  As for monopolies in international *power*, my own guess
<br>
is that it doesn't make much difference provided that the monopoly
<br>
holders are Western democracies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This isn't intended to be understood as an assertion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that anyone sufficiently strong must be wrong, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely that it is reasonable to require [ask for!]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra restraint from them.  It is reasonable that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they be given extra scrutiny.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p>So while I cannot go along with the hypothesized &quot;might makes wrong&quot;,
<br>
the more intriguing variation on this wordplay is:
<br>
<p>Right Makes Might
<br>
<p>I can't remember where I've read this recently, but if we think
<br>
of &quot;right&quot; as meaning justice for all, and by justice we mean
<br>
protection of private property and strong protection of individual
<br>
rights, then the logic works like this:
<br>
<p>An economy or society that treasures individual and property rights,
<br>
as did Great Britain from 1700 to 1870, or the U.S. from its
<br>
inception to the present, (relative to other countries, at least),
<br>
generates more economic power than do competing countries.
<br>
<p>This greatly expanded economic power results in the democracy in
<br>
question, even without a militaristic culture, being able to
<br>
simply overwhelm its adversaries in time of war.  Ever since 1846,
<br>
that has been the entire explanation of the success of the armed
<br>
forces of the United States.  I think that a lot can be said for
<br>
the thesis that right makes might.
<br>
<p>If Europe were only to cast off the rest of its socialism, the
<br>
way that China is starting to do, then I have no doubt that
<br>
the U.S.'s role as sole superpower would be short-lived.  But
<br>
of course, that would mean no more eight-week vacations, no
<br>
more social safety nets, no more high absenteeism from work,
<br>
and vastly weaker unions.  Nah, forget it.  The Europeans
<br>
will never rise again.
<br>
