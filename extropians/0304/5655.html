<p>Well, if we claim that any/all experience of what appears to be

a transcendent reality usually considered spiritual is in fact 
<br>
an hallucination then we have a rather closed loop system going, 
<br>
don't we?  We can't possibly get any experience of anything 
<br>
transcendent because we will just chalk it up as hallucination 
<br>
or &quot;activated archetype&quot; and be done with it.  So I am not at 
<br>
all clear there is anything that could be encountered that would 
<br>
in fact be convincing that God is.

</em><br>
<p>It is a tad more than emotion that is involved in some of these 
<br>
experiences.  The grand numinous joining with all that is, was 
<br>
or can be, of *being* all of that, is an experience more 
<br>
powerful than any other I have ever encountered or can imagine 
<br>
encountering.  The actual experience was many, many orders of 
<br>
magnitude beyond anything I  ever thought or imagined it might 
<br>
be.  Rational judgement?  Rational judgment is a very pale best 
<br>
effort to eke out a few truths without really being able to See 
<br>
compared to that.  But is even this sort of experience 
<br>
incontrovertible evidence of the reality of what is then 
<br>
experienced?  No.  At least it was not enough for me.
