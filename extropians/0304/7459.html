<br>
<em>&gt; ...in this article on Bill McKibben's book. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/books/2003/04/30/enough/index_np.html">http://www.salon.com/tech/books/2003/04/30/enough/index_np.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I submitted the following letter to the editor in response to the
<br>
review of Enough.   The letter is probably too long to be printed, but
<br>
we'll see.
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>Enough is Long on Style, Short on Substance
<br>
<p>I read Katharine Mieszkowski's review of Bill McKibben's new book
<br>
Enough with some interest.
<br>
<p>The review does a good job of summarizing Enough.  At the same time,
<br>
it fails to point out some of the serious flaws of the book.
<br>
<p>As Mieszkowski reports, one of McKibben's core concerns is that
<br>
parents will use genetic engineering techniques to turn their children
<br>
into robots.  McKibben believes that genetic engineering will give
<br>
parents &quot;infinitely more power&quot; to mold their children than they
<br>
currently possess.
<br>
<p>This is a complete fallacy.  While studies of identical twins and
<br>
adopted siblings have shown without a doubt that genes affect human
<br>
behavior, they've also shown that the impact of environment is just as
<br>
large, if not larger, than the impact of genetics.
<br>
<p>Even on the most general tests of personality - tests so removed from
<br>
reality that they summarize a whole human in just 5 numbers - genes
<br>
account for only about half the variation in scores.
<br>
<p>Genes play a much smaller role in hundreds of real world personality
<br>
traits like smoking, religious beliefs and practices, political party
<br>
affiliation, sense of humor, and so on.  These details of our identity
<br>
are sculpted mostly by random chance and our environment - including
<br>
our parents.
<br>
<p>McKibben's other major arguments are similarly flawed.  Genetically
<br>
enhanced children won't live meaningless lives lacking in challenges.
<br>
They'll find /new/ challenges and obstacles to overcome.  
<br>
<p>Nor will genetic engineering take choice away from parents any more
<br>
than literacy and modern schooling do.  Parents have the choice of
<br>
raising their kids without sending them to school or teaching them to
<br>
read, but only a parent who didn't care about their children would
<br>
ever act in such a way.  If the situation becomes the same with
<br>
genetic engineering, it will be only because we've found some genetic
<br>
tweaks to our children which virtually everyone agrees are a benefit.
<br>
<p>In the end, McKibben's book is long on style but short on both
<br>
scientific accuracy and thoroughly considered arguments.
