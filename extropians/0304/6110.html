Legally you may have the terms right.  But how was the law enforced?  I 
<br>
quote:
<br>
The law forbids the man or woman
<br>
Who steals a goose from off the common
<br>
But lets the greater felon loose
<br>
Who steals the common from the goose.
<br>
<p>So at least some portion of the population disagreed with your history.  
<br>
And they were present.
