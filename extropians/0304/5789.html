<p>On the contrary; if you accept at least one level of parallel worlds then 
<br>
&quot;probability&quot; is a word which refers to exactly this kind of branching. 
<br>
That's why I analogized to many-worlds.  If I flip a quantum coin before 
<br>
getting in a car, and either many-worlds or open cosmology is correct, 
<br>
then around half of the entities that are future histories of me get in 
<br>
the car and end up at the grocery, while half of the entities that are 
<br>
future histories of me stay at home.  I'd just as soon get in the car 
<br>
without flipping the coin, thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, if you teleport to point B and your point A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version is not disintegrated, then with 100% probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you arrive at B *and* with 100% probability you remain at A.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Needless to say, this is highly counter-intuitive, and although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution has prepared us for understanding being at two times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the same place, we are unprepared for the logically equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real possibility of being in two places at the same time.
</em><br>
<p>There's a 100% probability that an Eliezer arrives at B, and a 100% 
<br>
probability that an Eliezer stays at A, which means that my &quot;subjective 
<br>
probability&quot; of going to B is 50%.  Just as in many-worlds theory, there 
<br>
is a 100% chance of the split occurring, and in this split some of my 
<br>
measure definitely goes to &quot;Eliezer at grocery&quot; and some of my measure 
<br>
definitely goes to &quot;Eliezer at home&quot;, in two definitely existing parallel 
<br>
worlds.  Therefore, my &quot;subjective probability&quot; of going to the grocery is 
<br>
|Eliezer-B|^2 and my &quot;subjective probability&quot; of staying at home is 
<br>
|Eliezer-A|^2.  Both branches definitely exist, of course.  Perhaps you 
<br>
have not sufficiently internalized this branching aspect of selfhood if 
<br>
you cannot understand why I would want as much of myself as possible to go 
<br>
into the best available branch; a nonbranching transition to Disneyland is 
<br>
better than a branching transition to Disneyland, for the same reason that 
<br>
a million dollars cash is better than a quantum lottery ticket.  Or to put 
<br>
it another way, if I were to flip a quantum coin as to whether to go to 
<br>
Disneyland, I would prefer it to be weighted as much as possible toward 
<br>
Disneyland - both copies of me will definitely exist, of course, but I 
<br>
want as much measure as possible to go to Disneyland.  So if I can send 
<br>
practically all of my measure to Disneyland by not flipping the coin, or 
<br>
through a nonduplicative teleport, why not?
<br>
<p>Although you may have prepared yourself for understanding being in two 
<br>
places at one time, you seem unprepared for the logically equally real 
<br>
possibility of renormalizing continuous subjective probability measures 
<br>
applied to multiple branches of yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That you *should* anticipate being in both places is demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the possibility that later the memories conceivably could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merged; at that point, it would be apparent to the future you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it had been a mistake not to anticipate both possibilities.
</em><br>
<p>I *do* anticipate being in both places.  That's *why* I want a move rather 
<br>
than a copy.  I *want* be in the grocery and I anticipate the frustration 
<br>
of the Eliezer who finds himself still at home.  When I snap my fingers I 
<br>
should just go where I want, dammit!
