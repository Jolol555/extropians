<p>Excuse me but I was responding to imho opinion very empty points 
<br>
and comments that required a reminder that a war is not just 
<br>
between governments as was directly claimed in what I was 
<br>
responding to.  I would not think I needed to state the obvious 
<br>
either until the obvious was ignored and made light of.  I am 
<br>
also getting damn tired of being attacked and patronized by some 
<br>
on this list.  I had hoped that that sort of thing had improved 
<br>
here but apparently not.
<br>
<p>Please do not roll out the &quot;because US was involved in a cold 
<br>
war&quot; as a given and accepted by all right thinking beings 
<br>
excuse.  It is not universally accepted as accurate or adequate. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is annoying when it seemingly glibly is asserted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Perhaps you know something that I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are really obscuring and unhelpful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I was generously allowing the possibility that I did not see 
<br>
what the point was because what seemed to be claimed struck me 
<br>
as absurd.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the thread &quot;Arab World Stunned by Baghdad's Fall&quot; you write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Our motives were not to free the Iraqis.  At one time I believe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you admitted as much at least indirectly.  You have seemed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;believe the motive was WMD.  We found none.  So do the Iraqis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;dancing in the street say that our motives were other than what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they were or that the war was justified?  I don't think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly, why do you not allow that there can be a mixture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of motives? 
</em><br>
<p>Obviously I do allow that.  However, none of the stated motives 
<br>
or all of them put together seem sufficient to explain our 
<br>
actions to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A mixture of motives is often the case when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions are made, at least by adults.  Secondly, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really is a HUGE difference between Iraq's case and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases of other countries who eliminated their WMD.  During
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Clinton administration, in 1993 or 94, Saddam Hussein's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sons-in-law blew the whistle on him, and pointed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspectors to documents showing there were thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liters of anthrax and tons of VX nerve gas, (and that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were still trying to buy materials to make nuclear weapons).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Strange that this was never found.  Do you think that perhaps 
<br>
the whistle blowers may have had ulterior motives of their own 
<br>
or may even have been put up to it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now in South Africa, and Turkmenistan (I think it was), other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries that were trying to disarm, there are clear paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trails of covering the destruction of the forbidden weapons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and plenty of evidence to show what had happened to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was none in Iraq.  So either the weapons are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, or they have been moved.  They don't just disappear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Where is the WMD?  Show it to me.  We control the land. Where's 
<br>
the beef?  Why was it necessary to invade to find any if there 
<br>
was some to be found?  Are you claiming after all the 
<br>
inspections and all this effort coming up empty handed that WMD 
<br>
really was a true reason we went in?
<br>
<p>The most likely explanation for not finding it was that the 
<br>
claims that these volumes of WMD existed were bogus to start with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If my culture comes into your country and blows hell out of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;infrastructure and perhaps kills some of your loved ones are you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;going to be particularly inclined to absorb my cultural values 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or even give them a fair hearing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Already your words are belied by the events of yesterday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have happened after you wrote this.  But in point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, despite the HUGE destruction of Germany and Japan,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's EXACTLY what happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, they are not.  Wait and see.  An early set of pictures you 
<br>
want to see and you believe we have done good and all will be 
<br>
rosy?  And they excuse me of being naive.  Germany and Japan 
<br>
were extremely different situations, among other differences, 
<br>
they were countries that were actually at war with us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I always wonder why some people so misread the probable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior of others.  For every whacked-out Arab who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspired by the latest show of Western force, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably five who wonder if their course shouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Fear is a poor substitute for diplomacy if the goal is to 
<br>
transform a country to freer and more independent ways. I could 
<br>
be wrong but I doubt very much we will attempt a Marshall Plan 
<br>
in Iraq or something similar.  I still consider the most likely 
<br>
hypothesis to be that we are after control of the region and 
<br>
control of as much of the oil as possible.  If I am right 
<br>
actually building a democratic free and independent Iraq would 
<br>
run counter to our true interests.  Time will tell.
