<em>&gt;&gt;As in most mammals.  I meant could it be in the liver or other organs

<em>&gt; Possibly. I don't know.

<em>&gt; It is however quite amazing that these scientists did not suffer any disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from eating a diet of only meat for a year or more. One might argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only Eskimos can thrive on such a diet, but these researchers were Anglo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It also is interesting that they had no heart disease, tooth decay, or 
<br>
other problems that we all face today... even when they lived to be very 
<br>
old. As long as they stayed on their traditional diet. I think though 
<br>
there must have been hidden sources of vitamin C. For instance you often 
<br>
hear of other groups such as the plains indians in America who primarily 
<br>
lived from buffalo, but in most recipes for their amazing pemmican 
<br>
product you will see that they included dried berries.
<br>
<p>I actually found a supplier of real buffalo pemmican in Canada and am 
<br>
thinking of trying some.
<br>
<p>P.S. There are something like 2 million people in Poland who are 
<br>
following a similar high fat diet called &quot;Optimal Diet&quot; who are 
<br>
apparently doing very well.
