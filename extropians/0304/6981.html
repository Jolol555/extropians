<p>
The book is bloody awful. It's the horrid Chrichton combination of hideously
<br>
bad plot that only seems plausible/non-contrived to people who know SFA
<br>
about the subject matter (ie: practically everyone), combined with an
<br>
incredibly readable style that makes it impossible to stop reading once you
<br>
begin (like watching daytime soaps).
<br>
<p>It's the worst of intellectual junk food masquerading as a banquet. 
<br>
<p>No, it's much worse than that. Chrichton is an arch-luddite. I've read Prey
<br>
and Timeline recently (yes I'm an idiot), and his standard plot seems to
<br>
go...
<br>
<p>- Startup technology company has a big idea. They develop it in secret
<br>
- Enough detail is laid out about the technology, and the background, to
<br>
convince the lay reader that Chrichton knows his stuff. So the reader may
<br>
feel free to accept that he/she is reading Truth.
<br>
- We get to see the detail of the secret labs in which the technology is
<br>
even now being operated.
<br>
- All technology is fundamentally bad, and corrupting. Tech company top
<br>
execs are corrupted and turn out to be the bad guys, this is hinted at from
<br>
the start (although is it really necessary... after all, it's obvious, isn't
<br>
it?)
<br>
- So the technology, which had some excellent promise, ends up having the
<br>
potential to Destroy Everything
<br>
- The story unfolds, and we find the true evil in the tech company's
<br>
approach - a combination of hubris, greed, and lack of due care.
<br>
- The hero, who has known all along that this technology is too dangerous to
<br>
tinker with, and been marginalised by all and sundry as a naysayer, now
<br>
takes control. &quot;We must stop it before it is too late&quot;
<br>
- At this point, the superficial attempt at a consistent plot based on
<br>
actual science goes directly out the window.
<br>
- Cue killer monsters, showdowns with evil tech execs, smaller explosions,
<br>
bits of roof falling in, and the heroes saving everyone just in time.
<br>
- Evil tech exec's base/headquarters explode, likely with them inside. Or,
<br>
they get their come-uppance in some other horrible but ultimately
<br>
just-desserts implying way.
<br>
- Epilogue - whew, we did it just in time. See, technology X is really bad,
<br>
well, all technology is really bad, really.
<br>
- End of screenplay (I mean book).
<br>
<p>&quot;Prey&quot; is a novel of monumental stupidity. Chrichton absolutely twists
<br>
himself in knots, combining really interesting stuff - nanotech replicators,
<br>
distributed agent software, evolutionary algorithms - and melodramatically
<br>
evil tech execs to come up with... Raptors. His take on nanotech gone wrong
<br>
are nanotech swarms that behave like killer dinosaurs: they replicate, they
<br>
hunt in packs, they even behave exactly like predatory killers (because
<br>
that's how they were programmed, but gosh, they are evolving even smarter
<br>
tactics!). And, wow, was I ever surprised when it turned out that the
<br>
nanotech macro-critters were reproducing by consuming mammalian flesh! Oh
<br>
dear!
<br>
<p>You will note that Chrichton sold the rights to the movie of Prey before the
<br>
book was published (indeed, before it was written I'll wager). The book (and
<br>
Timeline) read like they were written to a cynical formula (technology gone
<br>
bad, symptomatic of the evils of the modern world), designed solely to
<br>
appeal to the uninformed as a movie.
<br>
<p>Timeline annoyed me in a different way; it's just so boneheaded that it's
<br>
unbelievable. Granted, the timetravel in the novel is just an excuse to put
<br>
modern characters in the 14th century and play knights (I wonder why no one
<br>
ever thought of that before), but really. This is a novel where the tense
<br>
climax plays out as the people in the present day rush to fix their time
<br>
machine apparatus in time, before the people in the past run out of time and
<br>
can't come back. We get to see lots of parallel stuff - This is what's
<br>
happening Now, in the past; this is what's happening Now, in the future.
<br>
It's a race against time, across time. If only they had a f*cking time
<br>
machine! Cretinous. The guy is not a sci-fi writer's scrotum.
<br>
<p>You may have noticed that I'm pretty pissed off with Chrichton and his
<br>
novels. The reason is that he is a thriller writer, masquarading as a sci-fi
<br>
writer, masquerading as a serious science writer. The implication at all
<br>
times is that Chrichton has researched his material, and that his
<br>
novel/movie is a serious warning to the people about the dangers of these
<br>
hidden new technologies. We must stop them all before it's too late! And
<br>
people believe this bastard, who I am betting couldn't actually give two
<br>
shits about technologies like cloning, genetic manipulation, nanotech, or
<br>
(saints preserve us) pseudo time travelling through the quantum foam. He's
<br>
hit on a formula that will continue to make him an extremely rich man, and
<br>
all it requires is to publish dangerously, often deliberately misinformed
<br>
novels one after the other.
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm overreacting. It's just that, when I see mention of cloning the
<br>
Thylocine, or stem cell research, or Dolly the sheep, I can usually count on
<br>
a reference to Jurassic Park. People believe this crap. Our lives are
<br>
affected by it.
<br>
<p>Next time you hear of someone who could benefit from stem-cell technologies,
<br>
except that progress hasn't been what it should, what with banning of part
<br>
or all of it across the western world, think of Jurrassic Park, and
<br>
Chrichton. And ponder what effect Prey, the movie, will have on this world
<br>
of ours.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think I'll boycott it, and rent an old copy of Superman,
<br>
instead.

<em>&gt; My girlfriend just last night finished the fiction book 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Prey_ by Michael
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crichton. While reading it over the last week or two she 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spoke to me in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general about the suspenseful &quot;white knuckle&quot; situations in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the plot. She's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raving about it now. She says that given her knowledge of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must read it immediately. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The book is about some sort of nanotech experiment gone wrong.
