<p>
For what it's worth Caloric restriction never adversly affected my libido.
<br>
Increased it quite a bit a first but did not lessen it even at my lowest
<br>
weight
<br>
(Which I am guessing was about 15% below my setpoint and maintained for
<br>
a few years).  Caloric restriction did seem to affect my immune system at
<br>
about 17% below my setpoint.  I would not restrict myself that much again
<br>
without much better data.  Last time I looked at the data animal models had
<br>
lower immune activity but not more illnesses.  I think if CR makes someone
<br>
feel bad they have taken it to far or are doing it wrong, given our current
<br>
level
<br>
of knowledge.  CR mice are healthy, robust and active.  They look good.
