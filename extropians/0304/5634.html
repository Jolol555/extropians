I'd like to return to this thread after some time thinking about the
<br>
issues raised.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (just as distant mountains are within sight), should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be restricted in what appears on them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (I'm *not* yet taking a stance here.  I just want you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to clarify your position by considering a *perhaps*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parallel question.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why is one forced to look at people one considers ugly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and is not forced (I guess!?) to look at unappealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; billboards?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point so far is merely to point out that an economic activity such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting up a billboard is an act of force - it forces me (and others) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it. Like I said, whether a particular exercise of force is good or bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an aesthetic judgment. It may depend upon the characteristics of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billboard. Here in Florida billboards are almost everywhere - huge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loud. I personally don't usually like them, and enough people who think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarly have exerted THEIR force to pass laws against them, thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing advertisers to seek some new medium.  If the advertisers had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put up enough well-designed billboards *supporting* billboards, maybe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have forced enough people to agree to prevent the law from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>### In a previous post I pointed out that some elements of your position
<br>
seem to be associated with moral relativism. Please do not take it as
<br>
saying that *you* are a moral relativist, especially since this
<br>
description has acquired some features of a term of abuse. Still,
<br>
extending the line of reasoning you started in this thread might lead in
<br>
that direction, and this is why I want to oppose it.
<br>
<p>To summarize my impressions about your views, you were saying that
<br>
&quot;force&quot; or &quot;violence&quot; are strictly aesthetic concepts, have no important
<br>
relationship to the concept of reciprocity, that there is no substantial
<br>
ethical difference between violence as I defined it (e.g. rape and
<br>
murder), and &quot;economic force&quot;, including the subjective harm of seeing a
<br>
billboard. You are blurring any ethical distinctions between voluntary
<br>
and involuntary acts, denying the existence of voluntary interactions.
<br>
Furthermore, you postulated the need to use complex rules to replace
<br>
legal principles derived through hundreds of years of legal practice
<br>
from the simple distinctions I described, although  you did not provide
<br>
a means of assessing the validity of such complex rules. Also, you deny
<br>
the validity of personal responsibility, instead describing individual
<br>
behaviors as results of &quot;forces&quot; depriving an individual of choices.
<br>
Finally, you define ethics aesthetics in a manner at odds with commonly
<br>
accepted usage.
<br>
<p>Correct me if I misunderstood you.
<br>
<p>Now, I could argue against the views summarized above, but the whole
<br>
assemblage is sufficiently different from the totality of my views as to
<br>
make a succinct response impossible. Too little of the conceptual and
<br>
moral apparatus seems to be shared for a coherent discussion, unless we
<br>
planned on spending many days and weeks explicating our assumptions.
<br>
<p>Let me just say that my views are an almost exact opposite of the
<br>
summary, and leave it at that.
<br>
