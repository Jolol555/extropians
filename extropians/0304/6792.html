</em><br>
<p>What I said was that if you were going to perform an outcome study, you 
<br>
should test the modern setting of a metabolically salient variable (for 
<br>
example, sodium-potassium balance) against its ancestral setting.  This 
<br>
says nothing about what the default hypothesis for *best diet* should be, 
<br>
only that this is the way of testing one change at a time.  This becomes 
<br>
clearer if you look at the chaos of present dietary studies - people 
<br>
testing, e.g., lots of sodium against almost no sodium with no attempt to 
<br>
control for potassium, rather than testing a modern sodium-potassium 
<br>
balance against an ancestral sodium-potassium balance.  In scientific 
<br>
terms this is simply an obvious, straightforward method for testing the 
<br>
effects of incremental changes in order to determine the workings of the 
<br>
human metabolism.  One may or may not take the ancestral diet as the 
<br>
&quot;default optimum&quot; but it is certainly the setting that you would test any 
<br>
specific diet *against* if you wanted to see its effect on the human 
<br>
metabolism.  It's not a question of burden-of-proof tennis; I'm not 
<br>
telling you what the &quot;null hypothesis&quot; is.  I'm saying what the control 
<br>
group in an outcome study should look like.
<br>
<p>Or rather, it doesn't matter what the null hypothesis or Bayesian prior or 
<br>
whatever *was*, because there are now enough specific cases of modern 
<br>
diets being detrimental because of violating ancestral invariants that I 
<br>
would, indeed, tend to take as the *new* working assumption that the 
<br>
ancestral diet is better until proven otherwise.  That's not playing 
<br>
burden-of-proof tennis, that's a generalization from what's been learned 
<br>
so far.
<br>
<p>I again advise everyone interesting in arguing this to start reading 
<br>
through the papers at:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.beyondveg.com/cat/paleodiet/index.shtml">http://www.beyondveg.com/cat/paleodiet/index.shtml</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thepaleodiet.com/articles.htm">http://www.thepaleodiet.com/articles.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The first rule of scientific argument on the Internet is to get your 
<br>
information by Googling the science papers, not by reading other people's 
<br>
impressions.
