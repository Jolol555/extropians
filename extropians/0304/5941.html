<p>New Fusion Method Offers Hope of New Energy Source
<br>
By KENNETH CHANG
<br>
<p><p>PHILADELPHIA, April 7 - With a blast of X-rays compressing a capsule of
<br>
hydrogen to conditions approaching those at the center of the Sun,
<br>
scientists from Sandia National Laboratories reported today that they had
<br>
achieved thermonuclear fusion, in essence detonating a tiny hydrogen bomb.
<br>
<p>Such controlled explosions would not be large enough to be dangerous and
<br>
might offer an alternative way of generating electricity by harnessing
<br>
fusion, the process that powers the Sun. Fusion combines hydrogen atoms into
<br>
helium, producing bountiful energy as a byproduct.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;It's the first observation of fusion for a pulsed power source,&quot; said Dr.
<br>
Ramon J. Leeper, manager of the target physics department at Sandia, in
<br>
Albuquerque, who presented the findings at a meeting of the American
<br>
Physical Society here.
<br>
<p>Fusion power would be safer than fission, the current method used in nuclear
<br>
power plants, because fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste.
<br>
<p>Most fusion efforts have tried to use magnetic fields to compress hydrogen
<br>
to temperatures hot enough for fusion to occur continuously, as it does in
<br>
the Sun. But sustaining a dense hot cloud of hydrogen gas has proved
<br>
trickier than scientists thought when they started fusion experiments 50
<br>
years ago. Even proponents say decades of research and expensive reactors
<br>
are needed before a commercial power plant is possible. Dr. Jeff Quintenz,
<br>
director of the Pulsed Power Sciences Center at Sandia, likened the approach
<br>
to burning coal in a furnace.
<br>
<p>The Sandia experiments, by comparison, could lead to something more like an
<br>
internal combustion engine, in which power is generated through a series of
<br>
explosions. &quot;Squirt in a little bit of fuel, explode it,&quot; Dr. Quintenz said.
<br>
&quot;Squirt in a little bit of fuel, explode it.&quot;
<br>
<p>That approach is potentially simpler, eliminating the need to confine hot
<br>
hydrogen gas. But designing a machine that could detonate controlled
<br>
thermonuclear explosions in quick succession - and survive them - is an
<br>
engineering challenge that scientists have only begun to think about. 
<br>
<p>Earlier, scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California
<br>
set off fusion explosions by shining intense lasers on hydrogen capsules.
<br>
Livermore plans to further that research in a new National Ignition
<br>
Facility. Other scientists are looking to implode hydrogen with beams of
<br>
heavy elements like xenon or cesium. 
<br>
<p>The Sandia apparatus, the Z accelerator, was originally built to study
<br>
nuclear weapons explosions without actual nuclear tests. In the mid-90's,
<br>
the Z accelerator put out an impressive 20 trillion watts of X-rays. But
<br>
that was far short of what is needed to induce fusion, and Sandia officials
<br>
considered turning it off.
<br>
<p>Improvements have raised the peak X-ray power by a factor of 10, to more
<br>
than 200 trillion watts. It has been considered a dark-horse candidate for
<br>
practical fusion. &quot;We are solidly in the fusion regime,&quot; Dr. Quintenz said.
<br>
&quot;We're in the game.&quot;
<br>
<p>For a few billionths of a second, the power of the X-rays crashing into the
<br>
hydrogen capsule far exceeds the output of all the world's power plants.
<br>
<p>Most of the 104-foot-wide machine, which resembles a large wagon wheel,
<br>
stores a large amount of electrical energy, enough to power 100 houses for
<br>
two minutes, and unleashing it quickly, which sets off a Rube Goldberg chain
<br>
of events that leads to fusion. At the center of the machine are 360
<br>
vertical tungsten wires that form a cylindrical cage one and a half inches
<br>
across. Inside the cage is a plastic foam cylinder. Encased in the foam is a
<br>
BB-size plastic capsule that holds deuterium, a heavy form of hydrogen. 
<br>
<p>The burst of 20 million amperes of current vaporizes the tungsten wires and
<br>
generates a magnetic field that accelerates the tungsten vapor toward the
<br>
center of the cylinder. The vapor slams into the plastic foam, creating a
<br>
supersonic shock wave. The shock wave generates X-rays that heat the
<br>
deuterium to more than 20 million degrees Fahrenheit and squeeze it tightly.
<br>
<p><p>In experiments last year, the Sandia researchers first detected telltale
<br>
neutrons produced by the fusion reactions. They confirmed their findings
<br>
last month. At present, the thermonuclear explosions are minuscule pops,
<br>
enough to power a 40-watt light bulb for a mere one ten-thousandth of a
<br>
second. &quot;This is a first step on a long road,&quot; Dr. Leeper said.
<br>
<p>A $60 million upgrade to the Z accelerator planned for 2005 will increase
<br>
the maximum current by a third. Sandia scientists hope for a larger, more
<br>
powerful machine later. &quot;The physics looks encouraging,&quot; said Dr. Dale M.
<br>
Meade of the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory.
<br>
<p>Eventually, to generate electricity, the Sandia scientists envision
<br>
surrounding the fusion chamber with a liquid that heats up by absorbing the
<br>
neutrons generated by the fusion reaction. The hot liquid would boil water
<br>
to turn a turbine.
<br>
<p>The Z machine can fire one shot a day. A power plant using the technology
<br>
would have to include a robotic system that could replace the burned-out
<br>
tungsten wires, foam and hydrogen capsule every few seconds. Dr. Quintenz
<br>
said the future plant might be able to produce pulses of energy one trillion
<br>
times as large as that coming from the Z machine.
<br>
<p>Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. Lasers, which can be
<br>
precisely focused, win the most attention. The $4 billion National Ignition
<br>
Facility will fire 192 lasers at one target. Lasers, however, are relatively
<br>
inefficient. Scientists looking to use heavy elements hope to take advantage
<br>
of existing technology from particle physics accelerators, using magnets to
<br>
guide charged particles. The Z machine is relatively energy-efficient and
<br>
straightforward. &quot;It's a simple technology, really, and it's robust,&quot; Dr.
<br>
Leeper said.
<br>
<p>Traditional magnetic-confinement fusion is also moving forward. An
<br>
international group may build a $5 billion experimental reactor. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It's premature to judge which is the winner,&quot; said Dr. Stewart C. Prager, a
<br>
fusion scientist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. &quot;We definitely
<br>
need more physics.&quot;
