This one hit the wires about 3 minutes ago
<br>
<p>NEW ORLEANS, Apr 24, 2003 (AP WorldStream via COMTEX) -- Losing weight could
<br>
prevent one of every six cancer deaths in the United States - more than 90,000
<br>
each year, according to a sweeping study that experts say links fat and cancer
<br>
more convincingly than ever before.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Researchers spent 16 years evaluating 900,000 people who were cancer-free when
<br>
the study began in 1982. They concluded that excess weight may account for 14
<br>
percent of all cancer deaths in men and 20 percent of those in women.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The study was big enough to back up a fat connection not only in cancers where
<br>
it has been known for some time, but in eight where it hadn't been widely
<br>
documented, lead researcher Eugenia Calle said.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Calle, whose study is in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, said she
<br>
was surprised the link &quot;really was the rule more than the exception.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A commentary said the study is 10 times greater than the largest previous
<br>
research on the topic. Top researchers in both cancer and obesity said the
<br>
research virtually proves they are linked.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Because of the magnitude and strength of the study, it's irrefutable,&quot; said Dr.
<br>
Donna Ryan, head of clinical research at the Pennington Biomedical Research
<br>
Center in Baton Rouge. &quot;It's absolutely convincing. And therefore it's
<br>
frightening.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Dr. Robert Mayer of Harvard Medical School and the Dana Farber Cancer Institute
<br>
in Boston said it's not certain whether one in five, six or seven cancers might
<br>
be prevented or better treated if people lost weight.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;What's clear is that large studies of this sort - and this is the biggest and
<br>
best to date - show very clearly this is a major health problem in this
<br>
country,&quot; said Mayer, speaking for the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The study by American Cancer Society relied on the body mass index using heights
<br>
and weights reported by study participants. For instance, a 5-foot-11 (1.80-cm)
<br>
person who weighs 175 pounds (79 kilograms) would have a BMI of 24.4, near the
<br>
top of the normal range. A 5-foot-3 (1.60-meter), 175-pounder (79 kilograms)
<br>
would be obese, with a BMI of 31.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
For the study, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 was considered normal. Those who were
<br>
overweight (25 to 29.9) or obese (30 or over were all compared to the normal
<br>
group, and statistical analysis was used to adjust for smoking and other risk
<br>
factors.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Earlier studies have found that excess weight contributes to cancers of the
<br>
breast and uterus, colon and rectum, kidney, esophagus and gall bladder. This
<br>
one also linked it to cancers of the cervix and ovary, multiple myeloma,
<br>
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, pancreas, liver, and, in men, the stomach and prostate.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The researchers found no link between fat and brain, skin and bladder cancers.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There are two big reasons the overall link is stronger in women than in men,
<br>
Calle said.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;More women are obese,&quot; she said. &quot;And also, breast cancer plays a pretty big
<br>
role here. That's obviously one of the most common cancers.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Too much body fat can influence cancer and cancer mortality a number of ways. It
<br>
increases the amount of estrogen in the blood, increasing the risk of cancers of
<br>
the female reproductive system. It increases the risk of acid reflux, which can
<br>
cause cancer of the esophagus. It raises levels of insulin, prompting the body
<br>
to create a hormone which causes cells to multiply.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Obesity also makes cancer harder to diagnose and treat. It's harder to see or
<br>
feel lumps and bumps, and some patients don't fit into CAT scanners, Mayer said.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They also may avoid regular doctor's visits, &quot;possibly because of their
<br>
appearance or they just shy away from physicians,&quot; he said.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;The morbidly obese are harder to operate on, harder to plan radiation therapy
<br>
for - often, they don't even fit into a radiation therapy machine,&quot; Mayer said.
<br>
He said it also is hard to decide the right chemotherapy dose for the obese,
<br>
because fat tissue sometimes absorbs the chemicals.
