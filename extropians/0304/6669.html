<p>The French are in better health than Americans with respect to heart
<br>
attacks, and probably also ischemic stroke. I'm not sure about their score
<br>
with respect to hemorrhagic stroke. 
<br>
<p>In one study I've seen, the French were found to eat more fruits and veggies
<br>
and fish and fowl than the Brits, presumably at the expense of fatty red
<br>
meats and grains. This could very well explain their good health in
<br>
paleodiet terms. Also, as you mentioned, their moderate but chronic
<br>
consumption of red wine very likely helps. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of course alcohol isn't part of the paleodiet either.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't be so sure of that! The French likely benefit from the
<br>
antioxidants (polyphenols) in red wine but this may be only part of the
<br>
story. Surprisingly, moderate alcohol consumption was almost certainly a
<br>
staple of the paleolithic diet. It's extremely likely that hominids have
<br>
been eating fermented fruits for millions of years. Also organisms in our
<br>
gut are producing alcohol constantly. In fact we've evolved an enzyme for
<br>
the specific purpose of metabolizing alcohol (called alcohol dehydrogenase,
<br>
if memory serves). The evidence suggests very strongly that the human genome
<br>
expects modest amounts of alcohol.
