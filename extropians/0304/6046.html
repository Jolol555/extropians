<em>&gt; (Hal Finney &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Trusted%20Computing%20(was%20Bad%20ideas...)">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...but any argument which includes the phrase &quot;the only reason would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be...&quot; is inherently somewhat weak.  Can we really be sure that is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *only* reason?  Given the vast possibilities for human motivation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity, and the tremendous diversity of human needs and desires,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we need to be extremely hesitant to claim that there can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be one possible motivation for an action.
</em><br>
<p>True enough.  There may be many motives for promoting TC, many of
<br>
I might even find admirable.  But I don't think it's out of place to
<br>
look at the past actions of some of those people and speculate that
<br>
their motives might not be what they say they are.
<br>
<p>Your mention of non-static content is important too. That, in fact,
<br>
is probably quite likely to become a popular medium, precisely because
<br>
static content is impossible to control.  But it also obviates the
<br>
need for any protection: if the product is a live interactive feed
<br>
from a server somewhere, then the server has no need to verify it on
<br>
the receiving end: the product itself is ephemeral, like a live
<br>
performance, and therefore easily excludable without TC.  The server
<br>
might want to distribute a trusted &quot;player&quot; app, but that app is
<br>
static content, and if they think they can control static content,
<br>
their business model is already flawed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or maybe someone just doesn't think it is right to take a version for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free when the artist who worked hard to create it is begging people not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;steal&quot; their content and to buy from the authorized distributor.
</em><br>
<p>People often buy authorized versions of things even when there's a
<br>
perfectly legal alternative, and business models built around that are
<br>
totally viable.  Those who prefer to download unauthorized things will
<br>
typically either do that or simply choose not to buy at all.  The only
<br>
gains a producer makes from protection technologies are among those
<br>
who would pirate if it were easy, but who will buy if it's hard.  All
<br>
evidence to date says that's a miniscule number, far less than the cost
<br>
of the technology to make it happen.  In real life, makipng piracy
<br>
easier has helped creators, not hurt them.  Who it hurts is publishers.
<br>
Again for reasons I've given elsewhere, I don't give a damn about
<br>
publishers.
<br>
<p>But that's an economic argument: business models based on control of
<br>
information ar not viable.  That's entirely separate from the ethical
<br>
argument over control of information in the first place, and I would
<br>
hold to the latter even if the numbers of the former were different.
<br>
<p>But in the end, you argue that people might still accept DRM even
<br>
if they we're forced to, and I'm not sure I can argue with that.
<br>
I'm just not sure that their doing so is really in their rational
<br>
best interest.
