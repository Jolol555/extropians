<em>&gt; Could we not extrapolate to a future where wars occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such a way that very little actual property damage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurs, most of the population is unaffected, and indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are unaware that a war occurred?  Could we be approaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dream future in which political leaders fight out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their differences and leave the rest of us to lead our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own lives in peace?  Finally, are we on the eve of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spike
</em><br>
<p>In a scenario where war is inevitable, I'd like to see a future where
<br>
everything was automated, so we just get robots and remote control mega toys
<br>
of various kinds slugging it out. The Geneva Convention could be altered to
<br>
make it a war crime to actually use human combatants, to harm civilians in
<br>
war, or to allow civilians to be placed in a situation such that they must
<br>
become casualties of war (you want to stop both the attack of civilians and
<br>
the use of civilians as human shields). 
<br>
<p>That's actually be fun to see on TV every night...
<br>
