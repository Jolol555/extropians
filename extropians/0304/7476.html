</em><br>
<p>Olive oil is not as rich in omega 3 as flaxseed oil or fish oil but it has a
<br>
better balance of 6 to 3 than most types of oil. I'm not aware that it
<br>
produces transfats when heated. Refs? In any case it tastes good and makes a
<br>
fine marinade when combined with red wine and spices. My idea for this
<br>
marinade came from a book by Drs. Michael Eades and his wife (she's also an
<br>
MD, but I don't recall her first name at the moment.) They've written two
<br>
books together, both about the benefits of paleolithic diets, called I think
<br>
_Protein Power_ and _The Protein Power Life Plan_. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought meat contained mostly saturated fat, olive oil is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mono unstaturated.
</em><br>
<p>Yes and yes. Olive oil is 72.5% MUFA. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought olive oil was mostly omega 9.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega 3 is found in other sources like flax seed oil.
</em><br>
<p>I am interested mainly in restoring a more natural ratio of omega 6 to omega
<br>
3. The best ratios come from flaxseed, canola and mustard seed, with ratios
<br>
of 0.24, 2.00 and 2.6 respectively, but to me they don't have the excellent
<br>
flavor of olive oil with its ratio of 13.1. This ratio is higher than I want
<br>
in my over-all diet, but it beats the ratios of more common non-paleolithic
<br>
cooking oils like corn oil, with its massively unhealthy ratio of 83. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder if adding omega 3 to meat after cooking it would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better for restoring the balance. 
</em><br>
<p>Might be. I often do that as well if the meat is too dry for my taste.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you reduce the carbs in your diet, you need to replace it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with fat for fuel, as I don't think protein is a clean buring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel. IMHO, the by products from excess protein could be harmful.
</em><br>
<p>I get plenty of other calories from fruits and vegetables. I make huge
<br>
salads with lots of vegetables, and eat lots of fruit for dessert and for
<br>
snacks. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I heard that half your fat intake should be saturated [as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from meat], the other half should be a a blend of unsaturated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fat [alpha linolenic, alpha linoleic, gamma lenolenic, etc.].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any comments appreciated.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a reasonable rule of thumb.
