<em>&gt; If you do not accept the argument from evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science that we are best adapted to a diet devoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of grain and dairy and legumes then obviously you won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept the notion that the burden of proof should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on those who advocate a deviation from the paleodiet.
</em><br>
<p>You have exactly nailed the flaw in this argument:  It only works if you
<br>
already believe in the theory.  It does not work if you do not believe in
<br>
the theory.  This is known as a non-falsifiable argument.  It is the same
<br>
logic that Christians use to &quot;prove&quot; the Bible by quoting scripture.  It
<br>
only works if you believe, and doesn't work if you don't believe.  As such,
<br>
it is not really a form of &quot;proof&quot; or &quot;evidence&quot; at all.  It is just a form
<br>
of preaching to the choir.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think that is especially unreasonable, Harvey. Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept the argument from evolution science?
</em><br>
<p>I don't accept or reject your conclusions.  I reject your methods of
<br>
choosing your position as the default and saying the burden-of-proof is on
<br>
someone else to prove you wrong.  I don't accept any unproven positions just
<br>
because they haven't been proven wrong yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And personally, I can't imagine anybody arguing *history*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting. This is also an infamous argument of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creationists in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debates with evolution scientists.
</em><br>
<p>I meant history as evidence of dietary superiority.  History is great
<br>
evidence that something has happened.  It is not very good evidence that
<br>
what happened was the best thing that could have happened.  Was the asteroid
<br>
that wiped out the dinosaurs the &quot;optimum&quot; event?  Just because evolution
<br>
takes a turn does not mean it is for the best.  I know evolution tends to go
<br>
toward survival of the fittest, but this is no guarantee that the result was
<br>
indeed &quot;best&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Macro-evolution (the evolution of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species) can't be true empirical science,&quot; they say, &quot;because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; macro-evolution has never been duplicated in a laboratory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's only an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument about historical evidence.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately macro-evolution is supported only by arguments about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical evidence. Do you take it as science nonetheless?
</em><br>
<p>Evolution of new species are too complicated to be duplicated in the
<br>
laboratory with twentieth century technology.  However, testing nutritional
<br>
diets is easy to test.  It is fully consistent to want nutritional studies
<br>
done.
