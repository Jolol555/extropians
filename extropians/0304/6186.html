<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Across the Middle East, people struggled to reconcile images of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; celebrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Iraqis with widely held suspicions about the United States' motives.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Indeed, I am sure some members of this list are stuggling to put a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;spin on this event as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Our motives were not to free the Iraqis.  At one time I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you admitted as much at least indirectly.  You have seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;believe the motive was WMD.  We found none.  So do the Iraqis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;dancing in the street say that our motives were other than what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they were or that the war was justified?  I don't think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I did not admit as much, I would freely do so now.  At no point in time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did I believe that freeing the Iraqi people was the US sole or primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation.  Frankly I dont care.  You seem really hung up on what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation is, try judging on actions instead of motivations.  We can never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really truly know what is motivating Bush anyway, or anyone for that matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so all we can really judge people on are actions, NOT motivations.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether bush tossed some chicken bones or weighed the options in depth with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advisors, the point is we are there and the Iraqi people are / will be free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cant you at least rejoice in the fact that 20 million people who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously living under the horrific oppression of a murderous tyrant are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now (or soon will be) free?
</em><br>
<p>I am sorry but we keep talking at cross purposes.  You seem to 
<br>
miss my point I probably seem to you to miss yours.  I care and 
<br>
very much what our motivations were and are as that is what will 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;leat to future actions and is the predictor of them.  I also 
<br>
care because I do not believe the utilitarian viewpoint that if 
<br>
things work out reasonably well then what we did along the way 
<br>
was automatically right.
<br>
<p>But I brought this up in this circumstance because I am 
<br>
astonished that a few Iraqis dancing in the street seems to be 
<br>
enough for some people to drop questions about what we did and 
<br>
why and what's next and believe it to be evidence that we 
<br>
obviously did the Right Thing (tm).
<br>
<p>The actions you want to judge instead of motivations?  The 
<br>
actions were repellent.  We just invaded a foreign country not 
<br>
at war with us and did so against UN and other international 
<br>
opinion.
<br>
<p>It is much, much too early to claim the Iraqi people will be 
<br>
free.  The most certainly are not free today.  They are under 
<br>
foreign occupation.
<br>
<p>I can't rejoice over something I do not yet know to be a better 
<br>
situation.  Sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yes, I believe a primary motivation was WMD, and the fact that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despotic west hating racist tyrant hadem and wanted more and wanted to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p><p>Then you believe things regardless of evidence.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say &quot;We found none&quot; I can only laugh.  As others have
<br>
<em>&gt; pointed out how silly this statment is, I wont simply repeat them.  
</em><br>
<p><p>No, they did not point out any such thing.  If you are going to 
<br>
be dishonest then this conversation is over.
<br>
<p>I will
<br>
<em>&gt; repeat something I said to you a while back on this very same point, we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ready have found WMD, in the 1994 inspections.  Thousands upon thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warheads, growth media, delivery systems, etc. etc. etc.  I believe your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to that was 'where did you hear that from' to which I (and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe Mike Lorrey) noted it came from Hans Blixs speech.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't think we did find those, certainly not today where 
<br>
it actually counts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of these weapon systems and delivery systems were not accounted for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that novel Saddam produced, which meant he still had them. 
</em><br>
<p>No, it does not.  Where exactly are they?  Are they right there 
<br>
and we still haven't found them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now on you will cease to say comments alluding to our lack of ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find WMD, when we all ready found them nearly ten years ago.
</em><br>
<p><p>We are concerned with today.  Is that so bloody difficult for 
<br>
you to understand?  If we found them rather than just hearing 
<br>
they were there ten years ago then we had inspectors there 
<br>
before we would have taken care of them, yes?  I cannot believe 
<br>
that you believe this huge stockpile was there, was proved 
<br>
conclusively to be there and we just let them sit on it for 10 
<br>
years.  I can't believe you believe they have it and that they 
<br>
did not use so much as one chemical weapon one time during this 
<br>
occupation of the country.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to figure out what happened to them now.  This is why Saddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'cooperation' was completely absurd, he could have simply put everything out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a parking lot and said 'here it is'.  Yet the media kept parroting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole 'we have yet to find any WMD' line, which as I have tried to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear, is a gross mis-representation, they should have been saying 'We still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dont know what happened to the missing WMD'  Had they been found in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place, the war may have been averted entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Is there any point where you will simply concede that there 
<br>
wasn't any of any significance?  What would it take for you to 
<br>
do that?
