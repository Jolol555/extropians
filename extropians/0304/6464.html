</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of many things I fancy about Greg is his candor.  (Psst - I'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checking him out in a few weeks on our scuba diving vacation. :-))
</em><br>
<p>I'm curious about the attraction of Scuba.  My sister, my father,
<br>
and his wife are serious Scuba fans. When they were first getting
<br>
into it I had a bout of Meniere's disease, so I begged off, figuring
<br>
my ears didn't need the extra pressure. But that's all gone now, so
<br>
I don't really have any more excuse, but I don't see enough benefit
<br>
either.  I'm not likely to learn anything new I couldn't learn from
<br>
books or films, the experience would be entertaining I suppose, but
<br>
probably not moreso than any number of other recreational activities.
<br>
So is it really worth the fairly significant risk of death?
<br>
<p>If danger is part of the attraction, why not do something that gives
<br>
a more intense sensation of danger with lower risk, like skydiving
<br>
or bungee jumping (my father and I did a jump from a railroad
<br>
bridge over Feather River canyon once--that was an experience I am
<br>
glad to have had but feel no compulsion to repeat)?
<br>
<p>So why Scuba?
<br>
