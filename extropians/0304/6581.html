<em>&gt;&gt;Is the question how much meat is healthy in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, that is not the question if the subject is Paleolithic diets. This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very important point. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real question is &quot;What is the diet to which we are best genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapted?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The assumptions underlying paleodiet theory are 1) the basic principles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary theory are correct (e.g., natural selection, adaptation) and 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern nutritional science is incomplete and fraught with contradictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g., the debates between conventional nutritionists about low-carb vs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-fat diets are not even close to resolution.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The conclusion then is that evolutionary science is a more reliable guide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making diet choices than nutritional science. For example if humans spent a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few million years without dairy and only 10,000 years with dairy then it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely that humans are not very well adapted to dairy. If the dairy industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagrees then they need to explain how we survived for approximately 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million years without dairy while having larger and stronger bones. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burden of proof is on them, because the *default* diet is natural and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paleolithic. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Uh, don't you need to examine the human body and what does and 
<br>
does not work optimally for health, longevity, energy levels, 
<br>
stamina etc.?
<br>
<p>Evolution will only fine-tune for a diet that is
<br>
a) avaliable;
<br>
b) sufficient to reach breeding age and a bit more to raise the 
<br>
young.
<br>
<p>Presumably (a) is much more flexible now and (b) is not nearly 
<br>
sufficient for our shared dreams and wishes.
<br>
<p>Evolution let to big brained creatures led to agriculture which 
<br>
led to such an increase in our numbers and health that we 
<br>
dominate the planet (among many other factors).  But this 
<br>
argument says little either about what is the optimal diet for 
<br>
our kinds of bodies in our kind of circumstances with our goals.
<br>
<p>I would much rather bet on nutritional science than some 
<br>
spurious guesswork about evolutionarily preferred diet.
