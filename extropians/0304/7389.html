<p>You can buy powdered Splenda and make your own artificially sweetened
<br>
drinks. I have a couple of boxes of it in my cupboard, next to a bag of
<br>
xylitol -- a natural sugar alcohol that has little effect on blood sugar.
<br>
<p>Also these days one can buy just about anything on the web. You could
<br>
probably buy any sucralose flavored product by the case and have it shipped
<br>
directly to your door-step, including Diet Rite.
<br>
<p>Splenda (w/sucralose) hasn't yet become a commercial hit like Nutrasweet
<br>
(w/aspartame), probably because the maker of aspartame (Monsanto, I think)
<br>
was early to market and tied up all the contracts with major food vendors.
<br>
It's true that diet drinks like Diet Rite are a little harder to find.
<br>
However you can force their hand a bit: a few years ago in the middle of an
<br>
extremely hot and humid summer during which I was doing a lot of heavy
<br>
yard-work, I bought practically every two liter bottle of Diet Rite Cola on
<br>
the shelves of my local major supermarket. There weren't many at first.
<br>
However after a few weeks I noticed that my friendly grocer had devoted
<br>
almost twice as much shelf space to Diet Rite Cola, probably just to meet my
<br>
personal demand for the product. (I no longer buy any; he's probably
<br>
wondering now what happened to his mystery Diet Rite fanatic. :)
<br>
<p>Last year I contacted the manufacturer of Splenda by telephone to inquire
<br>
about prices for mass quantities of pure sucralose. I was so convinced of
<br>
the superiority of sucralose vs other artificial sweeteners that I had an
<br>
idea to start manufacturing and selling my own line of sucralose sweetened
<br>
food products. I learned from the rep that I could buy large quantities of
<br>
pure sucralose for resale in other products only if they approved of my uses
<br>
for the product. I had some off-the-wall ideas in mind and decided not to
<br>
bother.
<br>
<p>Despite all these favorable opinions of mine regarding sucralose, my
<br>
personal health goals for this year include the avoidance of all artificial
<br>
sweeteners. They tend to lessen my appreciation for the healthy naturally
<br>
sweet treats of nature. There is nothing tastier or healthier than a handful
<br>
of fresh chilled berries, and they won't make you fat if you eat correctly. 
<br>
<p>It is a myth I think that artificial sweeteners do a lot to help people lose
<br>
weight. They might have some short term value but in the long term they only
<br>
help to feed the modern addiction to overly sweet foods. It is better just
<br>
to lose the addiction.
