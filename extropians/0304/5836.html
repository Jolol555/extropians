</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; paradox to suppose that it's a question of probability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary; if you accept at least one level of parallel worlds then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;probability&quot; is a word which refers to exactly this kind of branching. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why I analogized to many-worlds.  If I flip a quantum coin before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting in a car, and either many-worlds or open cosmology is correct, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then around half of the entities that are future histories of me get in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the car and end up at the grocery, while half of the entities that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future histories of me stay at home.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that *probability* does refer to the creation of
<br>
duplicates in the way that it does MWI fission.  Probability
<br>
refers to mutually exclusive outcomes.  But the heart of the
<br>
discussion concerning duplicates is that both outcomes occur,
<br>
and occur in the familiar everyday way.
<br>
<p>One explanation of how this is able to take place is, as Hal
<br>
points out, because probabilities sum to one while measures
<br>
over duplicates sum to multiples of one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just as in many-worlds theory, there is a 100% chance of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; split occurring, and in this split some of my measure definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes to &quot;Eliezer at grocery&quot; and some of my measure definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes to &quot;Eliezer at home&quot;, in two definitely existing parallel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds.  Therefore, my &quot;subjective probability&quot; of going to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grocery is |Eliezer-B|^2 and my &quot;subjective probability&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staying at home is |Eliezer-A|^2.  Both branches definitely exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  If in twenty minutes one million duplicates are to be
<br>
made of me in the Siberian wilderness, I will with great
<br>
alacrity grab my fur coat, even though the one staying home
<br>
won't need it.  Moreover, I will regard it as a moral certainty
<br>
that I'm about to need my coat.  Furthermore, the future version
<br>
of me who stays home will be flabbergasted;  &quot;Incredible!&quot;, he'll
<br>
say, &quot;this was a one in a million outcome!&quot;.  Likewise only as
<br>
a peculiar paranoid precaution (the kind of which we all sometimes
<br>
indulge in) will I grab my coat if a million duplicates of
<br>
me are to be made on tropical beaches and just one in Siberia.
<br>
Some of the ways that one's emotions go up and down about this
<br>
is illustrated in my story &quot;The Pit and the Duplicate&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/PitAndDuplicate.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/PitAndDuplicate.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps you have not sufficiently internalized this branching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspect of selfhood if you cannot understand why I would want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much of myself as possible to go into the best available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branch; a nonbranching transition to Disneyland is better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a branching transition to Disneyland, for the same reason that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a million dollars cash is better than a quantum lottery ticket.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, even in those million-to-one duplication events I just
<br>
described, I'd prefer all my duplicates to go to the preferred
<br>
event.  Yet if it's a choice between me *not* getting a duplicate
<br>
made, and having it made in an inconvenient location, I'll choose
<br>
the latter.  The ratio of outcomes is not the right way to look
<br>
at this---what is correct is the total run time I get, and that's
<br>
why probability also is not appropriate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That you *should* anticipate being in both places is demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by the possibility that later the memories conceivably could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; merged; at that point, it would be apparent to the future you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it had been a mistake not to anticipate both possibilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I *do* anticipate being in both places.  That's *why* I want a move rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a copy.  I *want* be in the grocery and I anticipate the frustration 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Eliezer who finds himself still at home.  When I snap my fingers I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should just go where I want, dammit!
</em><br>
<p>But the *moving* is inferior in most copy scenarios because you get
<br>
less run time.  Of course, I do agree that you'd *prefer* that two
<br>
Eliezers at the grocery supplant the one impatient hungry Eliezer at
<br>
home, but that's not the pertinent question when we are discussing
<br>
whether the original in an ordinary teleportation situation is to be
<br>
destroyed.
<br>
<p>In response to Hal's post you continued
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why should we renormalize probabilities for computationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent branches of many-worlds, and yet not renormalize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for ordinary duplicates?
</em><br>
<p>I think that you then go ahead to answer this question, perhaps
<br>
agreeing that we indeed should not renormalize for duplicates?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After the split, the duplicates will be two independent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are each worth One Person. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the original Eliezer, who did the splitting, is also only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth One Person - that there are two of him in the future does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not change this. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, then we should speak of the original Eliezer in the past tense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, when calculating his One Person's worth, we weight each of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer-A's and Eliezer-B's futures by 50% apiece, or if it's a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many-worlds branch, whatever their relative amplitude decrees.
</em><br>
<p>This is right in terms of the &quot;surprise factor&quot; that each must
<br>
experience because of the way our brains are wired, as in my
<br>
examples before.  But it is not right in the sense of how we
<br>
should appreciate what has actually happened.
<br>
<p>The MWI lies between two extremes, in my opinion.  Before MWI,
<br>
if someone I loved was killed by a meteorite, the loss was one
<br>
hundred percent.  After MWI, it's still tragic because I and the
<br>
others must live with this outcome, but I do have the intellectual
<br>
comfort/knowledge that it certainly did not happen in most worlds.
<br>
Lastly, if one of a million new duplicates I have is killed by a
<br>
meteorite, it's hardly worth mentioning compared to my great boon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have to do different calculations to find the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's future, the value of Eliezer-A's future, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of Eliezer-B's future.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure whether you are speaking of duplicates or MWI branching
<br>
here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When people branch you must calculate the future value for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *observer-moments* rather than *observers*.  The future value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Eliezer is the renormalized weighted sum of Eliezer-A and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer-B. [I agree this is true of MWI.]  On the other hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future value of Eliezer-A is the renormalized sum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer-A's futures.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I see.  In the latter you have each separate duplicate
<br>
doing his typical re-normalization.  Yes---this is what our
<br>
instincts require.  But in most duplicateion scenarios one
<br>
also has an opportunity to  understand the Truth of the
<br>
situation and to appreciate that one is also elsewhere
<br>
(to the greatest degree we are able).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I should buy a quantum lottery ticket in a many-worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe and win the lottery, I would not thereafter figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that my life had only 1/250,000,000th its former value, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though the happy event was only weighted at 1/250,000,000th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by my previous self.
</em><br>
<p>It may be that the key insight is for us to be less materialistic ;-)
<br>
and not treasure the money so much!  After all, winning the lottery
<br>
hardly makes nothing of the lives of all those others of you in the
<br>
MWI who didn't win.  But one must be very careful here, otherwise
<br>
one embraces the Suicide Lottery, kills oneself in every world where
<br>
one does not win, and &quot;renormalizes&quot;.  This tragic decision fails to
<br>
be optimal because the enormous loss of measure is not erroneously
<br>
not appreciated by the lucky branch guy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would just renormalize the futures in that branch.  [Yikes!]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that's just a guess.  I really wish I understood what was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with those complex amplitudes.  It seems to say reality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about measure in a different way than I am.  I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried to adapt, but...
</em><br>
<p>Yes ;-) though I'm not completely convinced I understand your
<br>
point here.  Perhaps it's your way of describing the strain I
<br>
have when *close calls* occur to me in RL, and on the one hand
<br>
am greatly relieved that I wasn't harmed, and yet on the other
<br>
realize that in MWI quantum mechanics, you can't &quot;beat the odds&quot;!
