I did a few spreadsheet calculations, involving the current minimum 
<br>
wage, the hours in a week, and the cost of rent in substandard housing 
<br>
in the area where I live.  Working full time at minimum wage, and 
<br>
without counting taxes or any other expenses (e.g., food, clothes, etc.) 
<br>
a persons would end up with less than $7 per day after paying their 
<br>
rent.  (I forget how much less, and I made several optomistic assumptions.)
<br>
<p>You might want to think about that, when you are recommending that the 
<br>
minimum wage be lowered or removed.  Effectively, it already has been.  
<br>
People can't avoid paying taxes, so they would actually end up in the 
<br>
hole for paying their rent at the end of a month, even with no other 
<br>
expenses at all.  (e.g., food, clothes, medicine.)
<br>
<p>Now actually the way people live through this is by stuffing an illegal 
<br>
number of people into one apartment.  So this means that they are at the 
<br>
mercy of any authority who has it in for them, and since they are easy 
<br>
targets there are many who take advantage.  And I forgot to include 
<br>
transportation.  Another necessity which must be paid, and can't be 
<br>
afforded.
<br>
<p>Your estimates and models are based on assuming that free choice is 
<br>
available.  This is in contradiction to the observed facts.  If you want 
<br>
to know why a disporportionate number of low income people turn to 
<br>
violent crime, look at the above and consider that desperation might be 
<br>
involved.  Or a reluctance to willingly sign themselves over to a life 
<br>
of slavery.  (Yes, it's a bad answer.  But desperation frequently yields 
<br>
bad answers.)
<br>
<p>And yes, I know individuals who have escaped from the trap.  This 
<br>
doesn't alter the fact that for the majority, it is real, present, and 
<br>
appearantly unavoidable.  If you strip hope from people, don't be 
<br>
surprised if they strip life or property from you.  It can be reliably 
<br>
predicted that this wouldn't help most of them much, but *you* wouldn't 
<br>
be there to know.
<br>
<p>I have never supposed that &quot;Homeland Security&quot; was mainly intended to 
<br>
protect us against foreigners.  I look at what they are doing, and 
<br>
observe who is mainly being observed, and I figure that where they are 
<br>
paying attention is where they intend to act.  Most of the powers they 
<br>
have been granted have nothing to do with stopping foreign terrorists, 
<br>
and a lot to do with controlling citizens.  Especially those who have 
<br>
been &quot;law abiding&quot;.  So I feel that the government is well aware that it 
<br>
is driving many citizens to the point of desperation, and is intending 
<br>
to be able to ride out the storm.  Like Napoleon as the Corporal of the 
<br>
Guard (I think he was still a corporal then), they will be able to draw 
<br>
a deadline, and kill anyone who crosses it.  I don't know how that bit 
<br>
of history will work out this time around, but if we live to see it, we 
<br>
will consider ourselves quite lucky if we live through it.
