<p>
Hal submitted an excellent post on how we might attempt to effectively
<br>
manage difficult or complicated discussions.
<br>
<p>I've thought for a long long time that Extropians could lead the way in
<br>
areas such as the following:
<br>
-Collaborative knowledge management,
<br>
-Rational and creative methods for defining and solving problems,
<br>
-Hyper-visualization of relationships between data,
<br>
-Effective, forward-moving discussion of philosophical issues
<br>
-Shared editable lists of resources such as books, technical references,
<br>
news.
<br>
<p>It seems to me the tools are available to get started, but we're not
<br>
effectively using them.  I'm a little baffled by the inertia, even among
<br>
leading-edge technophiles.
<br>
<p>Could it be lack of vision?  Are those who see and embrace this potential
<br>
still too few, even among extropians, to achieve the level of organization
<br>
necessary to proceed?  Do we lack examples?  Xanadu Project began in 1961
<br>
but never succeeded. Wikipedia, several collaborative blogs's and
<br>
newsletters already exist.  Given the preponderance of [*, Intuitive,
<br>
Thinking, *] personalities on this list I don't think forward-thinking
<br>
vision is lacking.
<br>
<p>Lack of time, skills, money? I know personally that time is limited, but I
<br>
see a large amount of time and effort expended on this list rehashing topics
<br>
already discussed.  It would be more effective, improve the signal to noise
<br>
greatly, and in my opinion be a lot more fun to contribute to building  and
<br>
refining a shared knowledge base than to repeatedly debate the same issues.
<br>
Such a growing knowledge base would exist separately from the ongoing
<br>
discussions of new topics and current events, and would provide an
<br>
invaluable reference to be linked into ongoing discussions.  A bootstrapping
<br>
approach to growing this knowledge base would show an apparently effortless
<br>
organic growth over time.  To the question of organizing the necessary
<br>
skills and minor cost of hosting, this is where the Extropy organization
<br>
*should* be able to help.
<br>
<p>Social dynamics impeding progress?  Could it be that some of us would like
<br>
to implement this vision, but we're held back by aspects of current human
<br>
nature?  Are there those among us who will put hundreds or thousands of
<br>
hours into personal web sites or posting to the list, but would not put a
<br>
tenth of that time into a similar, but collaborative effort?   Some possible
<br>
reasons:
<br>
- lack of recognition for individual contributions,
<br>
- damage to an open system by outsiders,
<br>
- concern by high-achievers of regression to the mean,
<br>
- lack of individual control of the overall direction of the project,
<br>
- resentment by high-contributors of low-contributors who share the system,
<br>
- unawareness or lack of appreciation of the synergetic benefits of
<br>
cooperative efforts.
<br>
All of these possible concerns appear to be readily addressable.
<br>
<p>There are many reasons why individuals participate on this list:  Sharing of
<br>
the leading-edge discoveries and thinking, refinement of our own thinking,
<br>
social interaction, the fun of debate and displays of prowess, and more.
<br>
All of these could be enhanced with the addition of a collaborative
<br>
knowledge base providing additive and synergetic growth and organization
<br>
along with a persistent group memory that is easily referenced.
<br>
<p>I think it's going to happen sooner or later due to the inexorable advance
<br>
of technology, but wouldn't it be fun to *participate*?
