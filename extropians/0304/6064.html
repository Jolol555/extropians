<p>Do you mean to imply that food is more expensive, and getting more expensive
<br>
all the time?  I find that hard to believe.  Considering we make more food
<br>
now than ever before in the world, and fewer people are starving than ever
<br>
before, and fewer people are actually farmers, I think the evidence
<br>
contradicts your assertion.  Even the UN acknowledges as much, as even the
<br>
poorest of the poor in the world consume 30% more calories today than they
<br>
did 30 years ago.  And the sole reason for that is because food is so cheap.
<br>
Lester Brown, one of the most vocal 'were all gonna starve' doomsayers has
<br>
been insisting for 30 years that *now* food prices will start to increase.
<br>
In 1974 he said &quot;Throughout most of the period since WWII, the world food
<br>
economy has been plagued by chronic excess capacity, surplus stocks, and
<br>
_low food prices_.  But emergine conditions suggest this era is ending...&quot;
<br>
In 1996, he said the same thing again, &quot;Clearly we are entering a new era.
<br>
An age of relative abundance is being replaced by one of scarcity&quot;  By early
<br>
2001 wheat was cheaper than it had ever been and the IMF's food price index
<br>
had dropped to the lowest value ever.  What is the evidence you have that
<br>
suggests food is getting pricier in an 'absolute' sense?
