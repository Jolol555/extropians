<p>Yes.  However, as with all aspects of aging, the best solution is
<br>
not to slow down the progression of the problem (by methods such as
<br>
stimulating protein recycling), but to *reverse* that progression.
<br>
In this case, our best bet is to find bacterial or fungal enzymes
<br>
that can break down lipofuscin and introduce them transgenically
<br>
with modifications to target them to lysosomes.  The same approach
<br>
can be used to treat atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases,
<br>
and macular degeneration -- all of these are caused by aggregates
<br>
of stuff that the lysosome lacks the enzymatic machinery to degrade.
<br>
See Trends Biotechnol 20:452 for details.  I will also be speaking
<br>
about such things at the Foresight Institute meeting in early May
<br>
and at the World Transhumanist Association meeting in late June.
