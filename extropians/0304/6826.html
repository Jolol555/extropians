<em>&gt; With something as serious and important as waging war on another country, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that something as simple as a popular vote on whether or not we go to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war could be effective, IF we were presented with all sides of the issue, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IF people cared enough to be that well informed. That way, we couldn't really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that the war wasn't decided by the people rather than by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration.
</em><br>
<p><p>I meant what in the current setup could have been done that was 
<br>
not done by the people obviously against this &quot;war&quot;?  We marched 
<br>
and wrote congress critters by the hundreds of thousands and 
<br>
millions and the war still went on.  It would be very nice if a 
<br>
war was put to the vote of all the people but this is not the 
<br>
case.  Even what the Constitution says is needed for declaring a 
<br>
war was circumvented.  So what could we have done differently 
<br>
and what can be done differently the next time around?
