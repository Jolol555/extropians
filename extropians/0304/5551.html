</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt; That show is appropriately titled &quot;The O'Reilly Factor.&quot; It's all about

what
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  O'Reilly is a godist, so at the outset he's intellectually
<br>
compromised (and that may be the biggest reason for his underlying
<br>
defensive/abusive demeanor) .  O'Reilly shows enormous disdain for
<br>
nontheists on his show (e.g., Annie Laurie Gaylor from Freedom from Religion
<br>
Foundation, Michael Newdow the physician/lawyer involved in the Pledge of
<br>
Allegiance case, and Amiri Baraka ... although the latter gave Our Charming
<br>
Host a sputtering fit which rendered O'Reilly - for a change - momentarily
<br>
speechless, ha!)
