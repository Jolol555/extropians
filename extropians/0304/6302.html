<p>Yes, and it might also explain the ongoing sexual revolution started in the
<br>
70's. Nurturing females would better appreciate males who share their
<br>
nurturing values, leading to the &quot;sensitive guy&quot; attraction. Sensitive and
<br>
nurturing male character traits might then might be passed on to future
<br>
generations.

<em>&gt; Since human babies have relatively large heads
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's a pretty bizarre idea, spike, but at the moment I can't think of any
<br>
way to refute it. 
<br>
<p>When I was a child in the first grade, my best buddy's big brother used to
<br>
tease me, calling me &quot;the little kid with the bobulous head.&quot; (I'm not sure
<br>
if &quot;bobulous&quot; is even a real word, but that's what my best friend's mean big
<br>
brother used to call me.) I had a huge head relative to my body size even at
<br>
age 6, and I was not a small child by any means. Since then my body parts
<br>
have evened-out, thankfully, though I still find it a bit difficult to find
<br>
hats and sunglasses that fit comfortably. :)
