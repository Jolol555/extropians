<p>It's worth noting that most surviving H-G cultures were the ones pushed into

marginal habitats, ones unusable by farmers or pastoralists.  If they seem to
<br>
eat a lot of meat, it might be because of a scarcity of plants.  The diet of
<br>
North American Indians might be a better gauge than that of Bushmen,
<br>
aborigines, or Eskimo.
<br>
<p>As for the aborigines, in _Triumph of the Nomads_ by Blainey, Mervyn Meggit is
<br>
cited as saying perhaps 70-80% of the bulk of the food eaten in tropical
<br>
Australia had been vegetables.  Also &quot;A man who spent half a lifetime with
<br>
aboriginals recalled long periods in which roots were the main food and meat
<br>
was almost a luxury.&quot;  On the other hand, where fish was plentiful it's
<br>
guessed that was a majority of the diet.  So, it varies a lot.  And technology
<br>
did change, both in hunting (spear throwers, fishhooks, nets, boats...) and
<br>
gathering (hey, we can eat that.)  Although I'd guess knowledge of plants was
<br>
earlier established in our homelands, vs. the Last Continent...

<p><em>&gt; difficulty of hunting with primitive weapons. As I mentioned, it is

<br>
Lack of signs of butchery or large-scale hunting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; extinction. This may have given impetus to the agricultural revolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hungry people had to find a way to survive.
</em><br>
<p>For agriculture, I prefer the view that rising sea levels did it.  Humans tend
<br>
to congregate on the coasts.  Give them a double whammy of climate change
<br>
(changing the climate foragers had been used to) and a rising sea pushing a
<br>
large percentage of the population back into the suddenly crowded hinterland
<br>
and you might have a situation forcing any incipient horticultural skills to
<br>
turn into full agriculture, where possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll find that Cordain article that you requested off-list, and post
</em><br>
<p>So, what do researchers *besides* Cordain think?  Are you citing a consensus,
<br>
or allying yourself with one side of a polarized academic debate?
