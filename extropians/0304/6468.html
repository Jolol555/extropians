<em>&gt;&gt; Justifying a pre-emptive strike without a smoking gun requires your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; audience to believe in your voodoo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I wait until your gun is literally smoking it's too late for me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm dead. If I see you pull out a gun and point it at me I'm going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do my damn best to get my gun smoking before yours. Is my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;audience&quot; happy about that? I don't care. Am I &quot;justified&quot;? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't care because I'm better than justified, I'm alive.  
</em><br>
<p>Not only that, but you're right. I, too, would pre-empt that threat with
<br>
everything I have. But when I want to do it with your money, you'll
<br>
probably need some convincing. Of course, if I'm in a position to take
<br>
your money by force, and spend it on pre-empting threats to me, then
<br>
you're screwed. But I bet you'll make a fuss about it. If I want you to
<br>
play along, to give me your money so I can protect myself, I'll have to
<br>
convince you I'm protecting you, too. I'd say &quot;This threat to me may
<br>
materialize into a threat to you, too.&quot; I'm probably right no matter
<br>
what the circumstances are. There is a chance, however vanishingly
<br>
small, that the Teletubbies will present a threat to you in the future.
<br>
Do you believe me? Do you trust me? Where's the evidence? How did I
<br>
arrive at this conclusion? If I want you to invest in my protection,
<br>
it's reasonable to give you a prospectus.
<br>
<p>Or is my voodoo good enough? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Today the USA has a reputation of Mr. Tough Guy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that might prove to be more useful.
</em><br>
<p>As a deterrent?
