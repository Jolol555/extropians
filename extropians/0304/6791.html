Another one of those small but important gems that slip under the radar in 
<br>
these troubled times;
<br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2952417.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2952417.stm</a>

<p><em>&gt;Ageing gene discovered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Scientists believe they have discovered the gene responsible for a rare 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condition which makes children age up to 10 times faster than normal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Children with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome (HGPS) usually die at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around the age of 13. There is currently no cure available
</em><br>
<p>Looks like it might have wider reaching consequences also;
<br>
<em>&gt;&quot;This is going to be very important in understanding the ageing process 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and this disease&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Professor Peter Clayton, Great Ormond Street Hospital
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;French researchers say pinpointing the gene responsible for HGPS will help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develop therapies for the condition, and even screening programmes which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could check to see if children have the defective gene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cell linings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They focussed on the LMNA gene. Mutations of the gene have been linked to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another condition called mandibulo-acral dysplasia, which shares some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characteristics of HGPS.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Researchers found just one tiny abnormality - a genetic mistake in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;segment of DNA which carries crucial information to a cell's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protein-construction site.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The LMNA mutation appears to affect the way the relevant information is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extracted from a gene so that the end of this segment is cut off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This means the Lamin A protein is not produced properly in some cells, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;although it production of Lamin C does not appear to be affected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The LMNA is a &quot;dominant&quot; mutation, so children who inherit a defective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;copy of the gene from either parent develop HGPS.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dr Nicolas Lévy of the Hôpital d'enfants de la Timone in Marseille, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;France, who led the research, said: &quot;Without knowing what caused this type 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of progeria, we had little idea how we might someday treat it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Identifying the gene responsible for the disease is a critical step 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward possible therapies.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Progeria is I believe one of the worst diseases I know of.  It's not only a 
<br>
killer of children, but a slow killer.  They get to see what it is they've 
<br>
been cheated out.  It's a tragedy for a child to die in an accident, but 
<br>
for them to have to go through 14 or 15 years of watching their youth slip 
<br>
away at 7-10 times the normal rate is horrific, and galling.
<br>
<p>This is a disease that as the Texans (apparently) say, &quot; It Needs Shootin' &quot;
<br>
<p><p>James...
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
