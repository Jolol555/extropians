These are calculations based on the mean, however.  Calculations based 
<br>
on the mode would be more illuminating.  One can project, however, that 
<br>
if the distribution of income has changed so that richer people have 
<br>
become richer, moderate people have almost maintained their position, 
<br>
and the poor have become much poorer, then the mode would reveal a very 
<br>
different trend than you are reporting.
<br>
And independant source (of, be it admitted, varying quality) do apprear 
<br>
to indicate that the distribution of income has changed in the manner 
<br>
that I proposed.  (Well, it's not happenstance.)
<br>
<p>More to the point, in my observation the number of homeless people has 
<br>
increased considerably and appearantly monotonicly, though not at a 
<br>
constant rate.  In a suburb you probably wouldn't see them.  When I 
<br>
visit suburbs *I* don't see them.  In the city they are inescapable, if 
<br>
not omnipresent.  So I have direct evidence that things are occuring in 
<br>
a manner that other evidence would lead me to predict.  (Again, 
<br>
unfortunately, biased.  I knew my observations before I accepted the 
<br>
theory.  But this bias is probably inescapable, except by someone raised 
<br>
in true isolation.)
<br>
<p>We don't need to visit a foreign country to find people whose government 
<br>
has abandoned them.  Some of the homeless people still have jobs.  But 
<br>
since they can't afford rent... well, rent plus first and last and 
<br>
damage deposit, it doesn't matter.  Then again, when you have policemen 
<br>
on welfare, because they can't otherwise afford housing on their salary, 
<br>
what can you expect.  Most of them won't keep their jobs.  If you don't 
<br>
have a place to store spare clothes, a place to sleep, and a place to 
<br>
shower, you don't tend to be able to keep a job.
