<em>&gt;Natasha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        By way of introduction, I'm a long-time lurker on the Extropians 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list. I have a recent interest in weight training and body building, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an emphasis on the health-improving aspects of the former. My job 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires about 180 days of travel per year, so finding a gym to use poses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real difficulties. This makes electronic muscle stimulator machines 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive to me. Such machines make no substitute for exercise, but they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weigh little and fit in a suitcase.
</em><br>
<p>There are some gyms that are national and international.  I have belonged 
<br>
to both World Gym (founded by Joe Gold of Gold's Gym) and Gold's Gym.  They 
<br>
are both now chains and Joe Gold has nothing to do with either 
<br>
chain.  However, the gyms are very good.  Thus, my first suggestion is to 
<br>
make a graph of the locations you travel and find out if there is gym that 
<br>
services these areas.  Then join!
<br>
<p>Second suggestion is to determine if you are staying in hotels, motels or 
<br>
people's homes when you travel. If it is hotels, then you can use the gyms 
<br>
in the hotels.  They are adequate.
<br>
<p>Third suggestion is to combine the first and second suggestions and to 
<br>
become more self-sufficient. This would require you streamlining your 
<br>
workout closet - purchase 3 workout outfits that are easy to wash and dry 
<br>
in the shower.  Pack all three on your trips.  Purchase an excellent pair 
<br>
of workout shoes and a heart rate monitor which you can strap on while 
<br>
doing aerobics.
<br>
<p>Decide which aerobic sport works best for your physique.  If it is running 
<br>
(which I do not recommend for anyone with prior sports injuries), swimming, 
<br>
cycling, roller blading, speed walking, walking, etc.  Also, decide what 
<br>
your body needs in order to become the body you want.
<br>
<p>If the body you want is lean and cut, then your diet will have a major 
<br>
influence on your goal setting.  If it is to bulk up, or lean down there 
<br>
are alternatives.  So, I'd have to know what your goal is and help you 
<br>
achieve it vis-a-vis diet and anaerobic.
<br>
<p>As far as weight machines for travelling, there are a few that are sold on 
<br>
TV that can pack easily in a suitcase.  Don't waste your money buying an 
<br>
electronic muscle stimulator.  Cutting your abs is not a difficult thing to 
<br>
do.  It just takes discipline.
<br>
<p>For abs, cut out fatty foods and large portions.  Shrink your stomach and 
<br>
drink plenty of water. Buy a bar that fits between doorways to do leg 
<br>
raises and also buy a mat to do crunches.  I use the crunch machine at the 
<br>
gym - 4 sets of 40 reps (slow and hold while flexing).  Then I do leg 
<br>
raises - working up to 1 set of 70 (slow).  The beauty of abs is that you 
<br>
need to work hard to get them and you will have a heck of a lot of respect 
<br>
for yourself for getting them!
<br>
<p>Bottom line, all you need is to get out and move.  Run or walk for 30 - 40 
<br>
minutes 5 days a week.  Work on abs 5 - 7 days a week. You do not need an 
<br>
electronic machine. Watch your diet and smile.
<br>
<p>I hope this helped.
