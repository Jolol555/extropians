<p>I first read this article when it appeared last year at Scientific American
<br>
online. At that time it also had a color graphic of the authors' proposed
<br>
improvement on the USDA food pyramid. Not sure why the graphic is missing
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>In any case in general I'm happy with the article. Any improvement on the
<br>
USDA foods pyramid is welcome!
<br>
<p>If you read it carefully you'll see their proposed food pyramid is a major
<br>
step toward a paleolithic diet rather than away from it. It suggests less
<br>
dairy and less carb, and more healthy fats such as those from fish. These
<br>
are among the most important revelations from paleodiet theory. The authors
<br>
are still missing a few points, imo, (for example regarding the
<br>
anti-nutrients in legumes like soy and the equivalency of fiber from fruits
<br>
and veggies vs grains) but I won't quibble. Progress is not something I want
<br>
to criticize.
<br>
<p>I see that article as evidence that nutritional science is finally catching
<br>
up to paleodiet theory.
<br>
<p>As for the authors' assertion that nutritionists deliberately oversimplified
<br>
their views originally in their recommendations regarding the current USDA
<br>
pyramid, I would say that, if true, it does not speak well for mainstream
<br>
nutritionists with respect to their communications to intelligent people
<br>
like those in this discussion group. Their approach might be good for
<br>
dealing with people at the seventh grade level, (the level at which most
<br>
popular literature is aimed), but for us I think it's just another reason to
<br>
be skeptical of any un-verified claims from mainstream nutritionists.
