<p>
<em>&gt; Greg's essay is deeply inspirational.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, absolutely.
<br>
<p>My own experience with Atkins: 
<br>
<p>I once followed Atkins religiously. I stayed in or near ketosis for nearly
<br>
two years. (For those who don't know, ketosis is a state in which the body
<br>
begins to metabolize fat for energy due to a shortage of carbohydrates.) I
<br>
lost so much weight that it eventually scared me. I am a stout 6'1&quot;, but I
<br>
dropped down to less than 170 lbs, far below my ideal weight of about 195
<br>
and less than I weighed in high school.
<br>
<p>Also I began to lose hair on my head. Convinced that I was balding, I began
<br>
using finasteride (Propecia) in an attempt keep my hair. I then noticed
<br>
something suspicious: my hair was not falling out in the normal pattern
<br>
typical of male pattern baldness. Instead it was falling out from all over
<br>
my head, from the sides and back as well as the top. I did some research and
<br>
learned that ketosis tends to suppress the thyroid, and that hypo-thyroidism
<br>
is associated with general hair loss. 
<br>
<p>That was enough for me. I abandoned Atkins and shifted to a Paleolithic
<br>
diet, which includes enough fruits and vegetables to stay well out of
<br>
ketosis. Within six months my hair was back and I was looking and feeling
<br>
better. 
<br>
<p>The paleo diet is also a relatively low-carb diet by virtue of the fact that
<br>
it does not include agricultural products of any kind. Also it does not
<br>
contain dairy products. Agriculture and animal husbandry are very recent
<br>
technologies on an evolutionary time-scale. The Paleolithic diet is the diet
<br>
to which we are genetically adapted. 
<br>
<p>The diet is very simple to follow. One need only keep one rule in mind:
<br>
<p>&quot;Eat only that which you could eat if you were naked in the forest with a
<br>
sharp stick.&quot;
<br>
<p>This limits one to meat, fish, fowl, eggs, fruits, vegetables and nuts.
<br>
Healthy.
<br>
<p>-Fred Flintstone
