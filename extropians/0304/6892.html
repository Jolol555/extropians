</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;unethical, unnatural, and so on.  
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>some others:
<br>
<p>Everyone takes the limits of his own vision for the limits of the
<br>
world.
<br>
-Arthur Schopenhauer
<br>
<p>Everything pleasant in life is either illegal, immoral, or fattening.
<br>
And anything that doesn't fit in those three categories causes cancer
<br>
in laboratory animals.
<br>
<p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
<br>
-Albert Einstein
<br>
<p>Everything that can be invented, has been invented.
<br>
-Charles H. Duell (Commissioner, US Patents Office, 1899)
<br>
<p>Faith: not *wanting* to know what is true.
<br>
-Friedrich Nietzsche
<br>
<p>Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.
<br>
-Lord Kelvin, president, Royal Society, 1895.
<br>
<p>I believe there is no source of deception in the investigation of
<br>
nature which can compare with a fixed belief that certain kinds of
<br>
phenomena are IMPOSSIBLE.
<br>
-William James
<br>
<p>I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God
<br>
who endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect
<br>
intended us to forgo their use.
<br>
-Galileo
<br>
<p>I would sooner believe that two Yankee professors lied, than that
<br>
stones fell from the sky
<br>
-Thomas Jefferson, after hearing reports of meteorites.
<br>
<p>If the whole world depends on today's youth, I can't see 
<br>
the world lasting another 100 years.
<br>
-Socrates
<br>
<p>It is apparent to me that
<br>
the possibilities of the aeroplane, which two or three years ago
<br>
were thought to hold the solution to the [flying machine] problem,
<br>
have been exhausted, and that we must turn elsewhere.
<br>
-Thomas Edison, 1895
<br>
<p>It is difficult to say what is impossible, for the dream of yesterday
<br>
is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.
<br>
-Robert Goddard
<br>
<p>Professor Goddard does not know the relation between action and
<br>
reaction and the need to have something better than a vacuum against
<br>
which to react. He seems to lack the basic knowledge ladled out daily
<br>
in high schools.
<br>
-1921 New York Times editorial about Robert Goddard's revolutionary
<br>
rocket work.
<br>
<p>So many centuries after the Creation, it is unlikely that anyone could
<br>
find hitherto unknown lands of any value.
<br>
-Spanish Royal Commission, rejecting Christopher Columbus' proposal to
<br>
sail west.
<br>
<p>Space travel is utter bilge!
<br>
-Sir Richard Van Der Riet Wolley
<br>
<p>The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances,
<br>
known forms of machinery, and known forms of force can be united in a
<br>
practicable machine by which men shall fly for long distances through
<br>
the air, seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the
<br>
demonstration of any physical fact to be.
<br>
-astronomer S. Newcomb, 1906
<br>
<p>Some have claimed that if moral knowledge is to have different origins
<br>
from knowledge of other matters, then moral propositions should not be
<br>
validly deducible from non-moral propositions. This seems to be the
<br>
intent of David Hume's famous dictum, in his Treatise of Human Nature
<br>
that it is fallacious to argue from 'is' to 'ought' or 'ought not'. To
<br>
quote: 
<br>
<p><p>In every system of morality which I have hitherto met with, I have
<br>
always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary
<br>
way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes
<br>
observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised
<br>
to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and
<br>
is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought,
<br>
or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the
<br>
last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new
<br>
relation or affirmation, it is necessary that it should be observed and
<br>
explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what
<br>
seems altogether inconceivable, how this relation can be a deduction
<br>
from others, which are entirely different from it.
<br>
<p>other references to examine...
<br>
<p>On the difficulties encountered by would-be forecasters throughout
<br>
history, see I.F. Clarke, The Pattern of Expectation, 1644-2001
<br>
(London: Cape, 1979).
<br>
<p>On the early history of the electric power industry, see Thomas Parke
<br>
Hughes, Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society,
<br>
1880-1930 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1983). 
<br>
<p>The most prominent critic of the “aeroplane’s” practical applications
<br>
in the early 20th century was a physicist named Simon Newcomb. See, for
<br>
example, his article, “The Prospect of Aerial Navigation,” North
<br>
American Review 187 (March 1908), 337-347.
<br>
<p>Brian W. Aldiss, Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction
<br>
(New York: Avon Books, 1986).
<br>
<p>This alleged '640k' quote from Gates is widely and gleefully repeated
<br>
in computing publications. See, for example, Ray Kurzweil, The Age of
<br>
Spiritual Machines (New York: Viking, 1999), 170.
<br>
<p>On early speculations over the future uses of aircraft, see Roger E.

revised edition (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994).
