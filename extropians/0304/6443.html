<em>&gt; &gt; So, what do researchers *besides* Cordain think?  Are you

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; academic debate? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've taken a side in the debate, for sure. However in my mind the debate is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over, except with respect to debating fringe-thinkers who still believe our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural diet is nearly or completely vegetarian. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who would argue that we are genetically adapted to a *grain* based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet are in my mind beyond the fringe and hardly worth the trouble of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debating. Some people will believe anything. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never seen any credible evidence that prehistoric cultures subsisted on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than ~30% animal based food sources. My own estimate as an amateur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researcher is perhaps a bit lower than Cordain's. In some of Cordain's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers, such as the one I quoted here, he estimates as much 75% of calories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from animal sources. I would guess about 45% to 50% based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preponderance of the evidence I've seen from all authors and researchers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But then Cordain is far more qualified than me and most other authors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make such estimations. Dr. Cordain has made it is his life project to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand paleolithic diets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I basically agree.  Or best diet would be based to a large extent on animal 
<br>
protein, perhaps primarly fish and shellfish, and some game meat (deer etc). 
<br>
Add some wild grains, some greens, some fruit, some tubers, etc.
<br>
<p>BTW, you do know that you are obsessed with this topic, right?
