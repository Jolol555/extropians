On Wed Apr 02, 2003 12:17 am Anders Sandberg queried:
<br>
<em>&gt; Just a quick question to the bright beings on this list: what is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite of antagonistic pleiotropy? AP is when a gene has a positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function in youth and a detrimental in old age. But what do you call a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gene that does the same thing all the time, but this function is good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in youth and bad in old age? Is it also called AP? It is the pleiotropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part that I am worried about, since the gene does not change behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any way.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm. I suspect that there isn't such a term in use because the 
<br>
opposite of antagonistic pleiotropy doesn't exist.
<br>
<p>There is also discussion that antagonistic pleiotropy itself doesn't 
<br>
exist either. (See footnote below)
<br>
<p>Pleiotropy:   One gene leading to many different phenotypic expressions. 
<br>
An excellent example of a gene with pleiotropic effects is the gene for 
<br>
myotonic dystrophy. Affected individuals can have one or more of a range 
<br>
of signs and symptoms including characteristic Christmas-tree like 
<br>
cataracts, myotonia, narcolepsy, testicular atrophy, frontal balding, 
<br>
mental retardation, and cardiac abnormalities, among others.
<br>
<p>It appears that most genes have pleiotropic effects and the terms 
<br>
positive and negative pleiotropy are commonly used by researchers.
<br>
<p>This is an especial concern for the FDA regarding biotec foods.
<br>
FDA regulations assume that pleiotropic effects will not occur when new 
<br>
genes are inserted into conventional foods such as corn or potatoes or 
<br>
wheat or soybeans. Therefore, FDA says, genetically modified crops are 
<br>
&quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to conventional crops.
<br>
A key issue is whether &quot;pleiotropic effects&quot; will occur when new genes 
<br>
are inserted into plants to give the plants desirable new traits. 
<br>
Pleiotropy means that more than one change occurs in a plant as a result 
<br>
of the new gene. For example, a gene that allows a plant to grow better 
<br>
under drought conditions might also make the entire plant grow smaller. 
<br>
The smaller size would be an unexpected &quot;pleiotropic&quot; effect.
<br>
<p>Hope this helps, BillK

<p><p>Reflections on an unsolved problem of biology: the evolution of 
<br>
senescence and death
<br>
William R. Clark, Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental 
<br>
Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, California, 90024
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
The evolutionary theory of senescence is based largely on principles 
<br>
outlined by Williams in 1957, and consists of two relatively independent 
<br>
parts. The first part builds on ideas first put forward by Medawar, 
<br>
Haldane and others, to explain how something as negative as senescence 
<br>
could have been positively selected in evolution, particularly since 
<br>
most animals in the wild do not reach an age where senescence is 
<br>
expressed. Williams proposed that the genes responsible for the negative 
<br>
effects of senecence (senescence effector genes) were fixed in evolution 
<br>
by a process he called antagonistic pleiotropy, wherein a subset of 
<br>
genes selected because they confer a reproductive advantage early in 
<br>
life may have harmful effects in the post-reproductive period; negative 
<br>
selection against these harmful effects fails because, as pointed out by 
<br>
Medawar, the force of natural selection declines with age. The 
<br>
evolutionary history of senescence-causing genes is seen as a 
<br>
nondirected accumulation of genes selected on a basis independent of 
<br>
senescence per se. In the second portion of his paper, Williams made a 
<br>
series of predictions about how the age of organisms at reproductive 
<br>
maturity, fecundity, lifespan and the timing of the onset of senescence 
<br>
would all interact in the life history of a species. These latter 
<br>
predictions, which do not depend at all on details of the mechanisms of 
<br>
selection of senescence effector genes, have been validated by numerous 
<br>
experiments over the past several decades. On the other hand, it has 
<br>
become increasingly evident that the senescence effector genes did not, 
<br>
as would be predicted by antagonistic pleiotropy, accumulate in a 
<br>
random, non-directed fashion in various species over evolutionary time. 
<br>
Rather, everything we know about these genes suggests they were present 
<br>
in eukaryotic founder cells shortly after, or even congruent with, the 
<br>
emergence of eukaryotes from their prokaryotic ancestors, and have been 
<br>
stringently conserved ever since. Complicated explanations of how 
<br>
so-called &quot;death genes&quot; may have evolved in eukaryotes are thus not 
<br>
required. It is suggested that the evolutionary theory of senescence 
<br>
should be focused on those evolutionary principles that have been 
<br>
validated experimentally, and that the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy 
<br>
be dropped from theories of the evolution of senescence.
