<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, I'll just go back to my former claim:  if you believe physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with all your heart, and so don't suppose that the particular atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that you are composed of have anything to do with who you are, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you won't mind teleporting, because the pattern of atoms will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the same after as before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is true.  I am not sure I know of anyone who objects to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleported in this manner.
</em><br>
<p>I was astonished early last year to learn that some highly
<br>
intelligent and thoughtful list members will not teleport.
<br>
That is, on my &quot;Seven Levels of Identity&quot;, they are at level
<br>
one or two.
<br>
<p>(The seven levels are
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
1.  Will travel by space warp, but won't permit disassembly of atoms.
<br>
2.  Will permit teleportation, but only if the same atoms are used.
<br>
3.  Will teleport, unless there is a delay.
<br>
4.  Will teleport, but finds backups to be useless.
<br>
5.  Finds backups acceptable, provided that they've had no run time.
<br>
6.  Anticipates future experiences of duplicates, but only one in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular.
<br>
7.  Logically, but not necessarily emotionally, anticipates all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiences of all duplicates past or future, near or far.
<br>
<p>and since I can't see how to reference Extropy posts from October,
<br>
I'll have to post the above list with explanations again soon.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The objections occur after the teleportation is complete and there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now two identical copies.  For a &quot;destructive copy&quot;, we then want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to kill one of the copies.  Is this act acceptable or not?
</em><br>
<p>I claim that this decision rests with owner of the resources,
<br>
perhaps just the owner of the atoms involved.  For example, if
<br>
someone came to me and wanted to be teleported to New York, and
<br>
insisted that he would permit me to gratify his wish only if I
<br>
also arranged for the destruction of the original, I would
<br>
reluctantly agree.
<br>
<p>But it *is* a dumb waste, isn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some people do not see a problem with this.  Others don't want either copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed.  This is the main objection to &quot;destructive&quot; copying.  It is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy operation, but the destruction operation that is disputed.
</em><br>
<p>The core problem is that most people do not realize that they
<br>
are both the original and the copy, in a peculiar way that
<br>
evidently we haven't been prepared by evolution to understand
<br>
intuitively.  Duplicates are self.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The decision whether it is &quot;acceptable&quot; to kill one out of multiple copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boils down to a philosophical question of ethics.  I don't think physics can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer this ethical question.
</em><br>
<p>That's right.  I would have to magically cross the is/ought
<br>
barrier to persuade my customer that there is no reason
<br>
whatsoever to demand the destruction of his original.  (The
<br>
fool probably is afraid that the original is going to go
<br>
home and sleep with his wife.  What is the emoticon for utter
<br>
exasperation?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question of whether each copy would allow themselves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die boils down to a question of personal choice.  I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics can answer this personal question of choice either.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, although I suspect that a totally consistent value system
<br>
would not be compatible with the result that an intricate and
<br>
rather marvelous assemblage of atoms (such as the original)
<br>
should be destroyed without a good reason.
