<p>
For many years I have always suspected there was a reason that
<br>
antioxidant vitamin supplements (Vit E, C, etc.) didn't extend
<br>
lifespan more.  I ran across hints that various oxidized molecules
<br>
such as superoxide or hydrogen peroxide might be used as signal
<br>
molecules and the genetic program was designed to keep them
<br>
within certain ranges.
<br>
<p>Well, now I finally have a concrete example of this.  Others on
<br>
the list may have been more aware of this but I was not so I'm
<br>
sharing it.
<br>
<p>These two articles from Science last week:
<br>
<p>Wood ZA, Poole LB, Karplus PA.
<br>
Peroxiredoxin evolution and the regulation of hydrogen peroxide signaling.
<br>
Science. 2003 Apr 25;300(5619):650-3.

<p>Woo HA, Chae HZ, Hwang SC, Yang KS, Kang SW, Kim K, Rhee SG.
<br>
Reversing the inactivation of peroxiredoxins caused by cysteine sulfinic acid formation.
<br>
Science. 2003 Apr 25;300(5619):653-6.
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12714748&amp;dopt=Abstract">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12714748&amp;dopt=Abstract</a><br>
<p>make things *much* clearer.
<br>
<p>It turns out there is a class of enzymes known as &quot;peroxiredoxins&quot; (which I didn't
<br>
even know existed back when I was &quot;into&quot; aging 7+ years ago) that are responsible
<br>
for keeping hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at low levels.  They have a well understood
<br>
catalytic mechanism.  In their normal mechanism they allow the H2O2 to &quot;oxidize&quot;
<br>
one of the cysteine amino acids in the enzyme (forming Cys-S-OH, which they gets
<br>
by a hydrogen attached to another cysteine (H-S-Cys) to produce water (HOH and a
<br>
disulfied bond Cys-S-S-Cys), then the enzyme is regenerated by a disulfide reductase
<br>
returning the cysteines to their original states.  One of the articles suggests
<br>
that this is the primary H2O2 management agent and that the glutathione/catalase
<br>
systems are only backups (that was an eye opener).
<br>
<p>At any rate, it turns out that when the cell wants to use H2O2 as a &quot;signaling&quot;
<br>
molecule, the overproduction of H2O2 can overwhelm the peroxiredoxins such that
<br>
the catalytic cysteine becomes &quot;over-oxidized&quot; (becoming Cys--S-OOH instead of -S-OH)
<br>
and ceases to function as an enzyme that can remove H2O2.  The cell has to do this
<br>
because if the peroxiredoxins eliminate all the H2O2 it cannot function as a signalling
<br>
molecule.
<br>
<p>This differentiates higher level organisms from bacteria where the peroxiredoxins
<br>
do not have the same structure and do not appear to use H2O2 as a signaling molecule.
<br>
<p>The bottom line from my perspective is that if the cell wants to use H2O2 as a
<br>
signaling molecule it will do so and taking all the Vitamin E and C in the world
<br>
isn't going to prevent that.  (Which isn't to say that Vitamin E might be
<br>
highly useful to keep cholesterol from becoming oxidized and contributing to
<br>
the formation of plaques).  It seems unlikely that antioxidants are going to
<br>
impact much on oxidative damage to DNA (and therefore cancer and some aspects
<br>
of aging).
