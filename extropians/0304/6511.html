<em>&gt; No, I don't think so. Look at Italy, Spain, and Great Britain, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example, for strong counter-examples.  I don't think that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the collective opinion depends on what is the government's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; official position. At least that how it looks to me on this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continent.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe saying 'depends on' is putting it too forcefully. I think 'varies
<br>
with' is at least testable. But, I don't have any particular reason to
<br>
believe it does other than the examples of the US, France, and Germany.
<br>
Your counter-examples challenge nicely. Nonetheless, the formation of
<br>
Maginot lines in public opinion seems reactionary. That is, even in
<br>
modern, Internet-penetrated, information-guzzling societies, governments
<br>
often set the agenda for debate. A string of a handful of controversial
<br>
decisions can paralyze the media for weeks or months on end as pundits
<br>
multiply like bacteria and attempt to excrete analyses of whatever issue
<br>
is the hot topic of the day. In the end, we're really no smarter than we
<br>
were before. Sometimes I wonder if issues get our attention because the
<br>
government has taken a side or because the issue itself deserves
<br>
attention. There's more to say on this, but I'll stop here. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, I had different experiences than you regarding German's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorable opinions about the U.S. government actions. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I lived in and around Heidelberg, working at Max Planck 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute Kernphysics Apr'98-Jan'03.).  While I usually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encountered favorable opinions regarding U.S.-the people, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opinions regarding U.S.-the government, were often 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative, especially after Bush came into office.
</em><br>
<p>You probably remember the tension a few years back when someone rumored
<br>
the Army's V Corps to be leaving Heidelberg, they were supposedly going
<br>
to close it down and move it somewhere further east. I think they closed
<br>
the base in Bad Kreuznach instead. But, during the last round of
<br>
closures it was interesting to see the pro-US business owners making
<br>
noise. With the best intent let me suggest that the Germans have a
<br>
better reason than most other countries and cultures to avoid conflating
<br>
a government with its citizens.       
<br>
