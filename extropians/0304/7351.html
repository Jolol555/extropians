</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aspartame; some people say it'll kill you (formaldehyde
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; datastorm? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes I've studied this in detail and debated it the numerous occasions. I
<br>
agree with Atkins that one should avoid aspartame (found in NutraSweet). It
<br>
is broken down into methanol (a poison), aspartate (a potential excitotoxin)
<br>
and the amino acid phenylalanine. Sucralose (found in Splenda) is a much
<br>
safer bet. Sucralose is a slight modification of the natural sucrose
<br>
molecule. (A couple of chloride atoms are used in place of, if I remember
<br>
correctly, carbon atoms, but otherwise the sucralose molecule is identical
<br>
to the natural sucrose molecule.) 
<br>
<p>Unlike sucrose, sucralose passes through the gastrointestinal tract about
<br>
90% undigested. As such it can't really do any harm, and one can hardly
<br>
argue that the chloride atoms should do harm anyway -- chloride atoms are
<br>
half of table salt (NaCl). And because of sucralose's extremly close
<br>
molecular similarity to sucrose it fools the taste buds and tastes almost
<br>
identical to sugar.
<br>
<p>One should also keep in mind that all powdered artificial sweeteners contain
<br>
natural sugars as well as articifial sweeteners. Typically they contain
<br>
dextrose and/or maltodextrin. The powders work only because the artificial
<br>
sweeteners they contain are much sweeter than natural sugar, such that much
<br>
less is needed for the same purpose.
