</em><br>
<p>Sounds right to me.
<br>
<p>In another thread I mentioned that it may have been consumption of animal
<br>
fats, especially fats from the brain and bone marrow, that allowed for the
<br>
massive explosion in brain size. The brain itself is mostly fat. Brain size
<br>
may have increased due to selection pressure for more intelligence in
<br>
combination with the increased consumption of DHA and other omega-3 fatty
<br>
acids from animal brains. 
<br>
<p>Our close relative the ape does not have a very large brain compared to homo
<br>
sapiens, which seems a bit puzzling (as in another thread here from the
<br>
past, &quot;Why not the Planet of the Apes?&quot;). After all apes do have a modicum
<br>
of intelligence. Why didn't natural selection pick up the ball and run with
<br>
it in apes, as it did in homo sapiens? The answer to this puzzle may be
<br>
simply that apes are vegetarians; they never ventured beyond the plush
<br>
forests and thus were never forced to learned how to scavenge and hunt for
<br>
the animal foods that would have provided them the raw materials necessary
<br>
for a larger brain.
