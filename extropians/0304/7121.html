<p>
These arguments always rely on the assumption that we are representative of
<br>
the most common state of intelligent life (in a general sense) because we
<br>
must be, probabilistically speaking.
<br>
<p>However, I don't think it can hold water. Look in from the outside; at any
<br>
period in the entirety of intelligent thought, all intelligent observers
<br>
must ask this question. Every observer will be outside norms in some way.
<br>
Using this argument, each such observer will draw an erroneous conclusion
<br>
about the future of the social universe, by assuming that he/she/it *must*
<br>
represent the most probable outcome in all cases.
<br>
<p>For example, I happen to be born as a white westerner in the 20th century,
<br>
with all the attendant privelage. Am I to conclude that the average
<br>
situation of all people is mine; most people live a life, and find
<br>
themselves in circumstances, similar to mine? I would be wrong; my
<br>
situation, the accident of my birth, is rather unusual and uncommon; it
<br>
seems improbable.

<em>&gt; Subject: Doomsday vs Diaspora
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a member of an intelligent species, born during an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unprecedented technology-driven population boom. It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinkable that my species could be the seed of a cosmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization capable of spreading indefinitely into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe. But if that happens, the future population of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the civilization born in this biosphere will be orders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magnitude greater than the number of all humans who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lived so far. This would place those of us alive now at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarkably early stage in the history of that civilization;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if one regards oneself as a random sample from that history,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this position is not just remarkably early but also extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely. One might therefore conclude that the future of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmic expansion is not to be, and that instead we are headed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for an irreversible population decline, cause unknown. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that scenario, the majority of humans that will ever live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is alive during the final population boom, and so we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after all view ourselves as historically typical members of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our species. (The majority of human history was spent on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; savannahs, but the population now is so much greater than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pre-agricultural one that the *numerical* majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all-humans-who-will-ever-live is urban ... in this scenario.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a version of the Doomsday Argument. If one pays
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to Earth alone, it is logically consistent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-contained. However, it seems that one also ought to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to regard oneself as a random sample from the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *cosmic* population of intelligent entities, and at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point the Diaspora Scenario of cosmic colonization becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant again. Let us assume that the average total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population, from start to finish, of a Diaspora civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about 10^9 times greater than that of a Doomsday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization. For average cosmic citizens (such as, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis, us) to find themselves in a Doomsday civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would imply that such civilizations are *at least* 10^9
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times as numerous as Diaspora civilizations. And in general,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one might say that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Validity of Cosmic Doomsday Argument (CDA) implies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Frequency of Doomsday civs &gt;= N * Frequency of Diaspora civs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   where N = (Typical Diaspora pop/Typical Doomsday pop)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a very simple observation, but I don't think I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen it anywhere in the Doomsday Argument literature. It would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be interesting to have a realistic value for N.
