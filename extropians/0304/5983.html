<p>The point, imo, is 'fidelity'.
<br>
<p>In 1993 [1] Bennett et al. defined the concept of quantum
<br>
teleportation, so. &quot; [...] we show how Alice can divide the
<br>
full information encoded in |phi&gt; into two parts, one purely
<br>
classical and the other purely non-classical, and send them
<br>
to Bob through two different channels. Having received
<br>
these two transmissions, Bob can construct an accurate replica
<br>
of |phi&gt;. Of course Alice's original |phi&gt; is destroyed
<br>
in the process, as it must be to obey the no-cloning 
<br>
theorem. We call the process we are about to describe 
<br>
teleportation, a term of science-fiction meaning to make
<br>
a person or object disappear while an exact replica
<br>
appears somewhere else.&quot; [2],[3]
<br>
<p>Now it can be shown [4] that, due to the no-cloning
<br>
theorem, we can get a *local* quatum trasfer or a 
<br>
*remote* quantum teleportation of one quantum
<br>
state, with a fidelity f &gt; 2/3, just if we destroy 
<br>
the original. It can be shown, also, that without
<br>
destroying the original, we can realize a *local* 
<br>
quantum cloning, or a *remote* quantum faxing,
<br>
of several copies (from 2 to n), but in the
<br>
fidelity range of 1/2 &lt; f &lt; 2/3.
<br>
<p>Thus, due to the linearity of quantum algebra,
<br>
and due to Heisenberg's relations, it seems very
<br>
difficult to reach, locally or remotely, by deterministic
<br>
or even by probabilistic means, a perfect xoxing, 
<br>
that is to say to have a perfect copy of a quantum state, 
<br>
or a perfect copy of an atom. 
<br>
<p>Btw, it seems possible to improve the fidelity factor
<br>
coupling entanglements (between systems) with 
<br>
relativistic movements (of these systems). But for
<br>
now it is just fiction.
<br>
<p>In Zeilinger's opinion within few years we could
<br>
teleport molecules. Polzik et al. already realized
<br>
entanglements between caesium gas clouds containing
<br>
(each) 10^12 atoms. But due to the (low) fidelity factor
<br>
it seems (to me) that in the future we could realize
<br>
an efficient polymorphism, faxing molecules up and down,
<br>
to the outer space.

<br>
<p>[3] THe no-cloning theorem, by Wootters and Zurek,
<br>
1992, states that no information can be cloned in
<br>
the case of a number of (quantum) states equal or
<br>
greater than 3. The proof goes, essentially, this way.
<br>
Let us have a cloning (xoxing) machine with an initial 
<br>
state |X_initial&gt;, a vacuum state |vacuum&gt;, a photon 
<br>
with a polarization which is a linear superposition 
<br>
like |ver&gt;+|hor&gt;. Due to linearity of quantum algebra,
<br>
it is not possible to get something like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|X_initial&gt;|vacuum&gt;(|ver&gt;+|hor&gt;) = 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= |X_after&gt;(|ver&gt;+|hor&gt;)(|ver&gt;+|hor&gt;)
