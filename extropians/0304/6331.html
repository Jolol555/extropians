<p>Strange thing about tomatoes: they are not truly natural (Paleolithic)
<br>
fruits. They did not exist in Europe or Africa until the original European
<br>
American explorers imported them. They did not exist even in Italy, despite
<br>
all the supposed spaghetti sauce in which we think Italians have always
<br>
drowned themselves.
<br>
<p>Tomatoes, especially when cooked, are known to offer some valuable health
<br>
benefits. But does their non-paleolithic origin carry some negative health
<br>
consequences as well? The answer is yes. Tomatoes are extremely rich in
<br>
glutamate, a known excitotoxin. Again more evidence that the human genome is
<br>
not adapted to non-paleolithic foods.
<br>
<p>By the way in my last post to Barbara I wrote about paleolithic humans
<br>
hunting the mastodon. I meant to call it the wooly mammoth. Small but
<br>
important difference.
