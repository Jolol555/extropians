</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure this will ever be true.  I personally have in front of me more
<br>
computing power, information retrieval, and global communications ability
<br>
than I ever dreamed possible when I was a kid.  I remember that one of my
<br>
wildest dreams was to actually have a computer in my own home when I grew
<br>
up.  Well, now I have much more than that.  But so does everyone else.
<br>
Instead of giving me a competitive advantage or a life of leisure, I now
<br>
work more hours per week than my parents ever imagined.  As we get more
<br>
power and capability, and as we get a better understanding of the universe,
<br>
we find more and more avenues of innovations so fast that we can't keep up.
<br>
<p>Most predictions of having plenty of time or resources are based on using
<br>
those massive future resources against today's to-do list.  When we actually
<br>
get to the future and achieve all those resources, we will have galactic
<br>
problems and issues and pressures which we never imagined today.  I doubt we
<br>
will have excess time or resources.  I believe that we will always be
<br>
pressured for more.  By the time we become immortal /and/ safe from
<br>
accidental death, we will be fighting the final death of our universe.
<br>
<p>Sorry to be so glum, but utopian theories will probably never materialize
<br>
unless we give up growth and expansion.  I'm not interested in a boring life
<br>
anywhere as long as there are still new frontiers to be explored.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, that's been the pattern so far.  In each century our ideas have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed so much that the most farsighted dreams of the preceding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century seem lame.  So I suppose that &quot;converting every bit of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the universe to more compute power&quot; may suffer the same fate. Somehow.
</em><br>
<p>This is my prediction as well.  My guess is that it will take more energy to
<br>
move a bunch of particles far away to capture other particles for our use,
<br>
that it becomes a losing proposition as the sphere of computronium grows
<br>
larger.  I think instead we will make due with localized computer resources
<br>
here and there that are just good enough for the specific tasks given to
<br>
them.  Whole planets will be converted to computers for some giant tasks,
<br>
but not every planet.  And who wants a computer that is far away or takes a
<br>
long time to communicate with?
