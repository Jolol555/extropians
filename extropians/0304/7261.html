<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;I was hardly first with that idea - it is inherent in the early

<em>&gt; extropian writings and the work of Ilya Priogogine. Open systems can use 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free energy to decrease their own entropy, and certain kinds of systems

</em><br>
<em>&gt; still a somewhat vague term even after more than a decade of debate in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the alife and complexity community).&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember reading Prigognine's small tome, which is hiding in plain site in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my bookshelf now. He might have been able to do the science of 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, that book was a fascinating disappointment. I remember trying 
<br>
to read it several times as a kid, but always failing. It felt 
<br>
like it should contain great secrets and insights, but everything 
<br>
I got out of it seemed obvious or just confused. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;My preliminary answer would be that in a finite region there can only be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a finite amount of complexity. But this could very well be an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponential function of the number of available states. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, back to Plato. If the Universe is infinite, so is available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge then; platonic forms and all that.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, that implies that there are patterns of arbitrary size to 
<br>
have knowledge about. If you have a finite past lightcone (= the 
<br>
things you can know about) then the amount of knowledge is bounded 
<br>
(but increasing).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Getting back to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original query by Jef; we need to ask if its easier to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity, then it is to use energy to travel? There may or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be theoretical limits to knowledge/complexity, but there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surely practical limits, if only temporary. There are limits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel speed, and the energy expended, but one goal may be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievable then the other. Right, now, in the very early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interplanetary Epoch, we don't know.
</em><br>
<p>I think Robert is right about the trouble of lugging around a 
<br>
civilization. Right now it would seem we could pack all of human 
<br>
knowledge plus some nanoassemblers into a suitcase, but by the 
<br>
time we have the tech to do that, the information will doubtlessly 
<br>
have increased far beyond what we can fit in. 
<br>
<p>To make more complexity, you need matter to store it in and energy 
<br>
to dissipate. The energy dissipation requirements are around kTln2 
<br>
per bit, so they can be fairly low. Moving that bit around in 
<br>
space requires either radiating a signal or sending the matter; in 
<br>
the first case you need to convert it into radiation sufficiently 
<br>
strong to be received far away, which is a rather serious loss 
<br>
over interstellar distances (maybe one could do a GPS like signal 
<br>
amplification scheme, but I don't think that gives you many orders 
<br>
of magnitude). Shipping the bit requires energy to accelerate it, 
<br>
and if you want it to go interstellar distances fast that means 
<br>
energy on the order of the rest mass. So it is easier to put 
<br>
information into matter locally than transmit it elsewhere. Which 
<br>
bodes ill for the interlibrary loans of the postsingularity world.
