<p><em>&gt; Exactly.  O'Reilly is a godist... Amiri Baraka ...

<p>One of the funniest things I've seen on television recently was the comedian
<br>
Dennis Miller's appearance on the O'Reilly Factor a few weeks ago. Miller
<br>
appeared on the show to take exception to O'Reilly's criticism that everyone
<br>
in Hollywood is too liberal (Miller is not a liberal, and he supports the
<br>
war). Miller obviously had his game plan well-prepared, and he was flawless
<br>
in its execution. He first buttered up O'Reilly with what appeared to be
<br>
sincere compliments and accolades, such that O'Reilly was glowing with pride
<br>
and off his defense, and then Miller suddenly SLAMMED him. I think O'Reilly
<br>
almost crapped his diapers. I almost did the same from laughing so hard.
