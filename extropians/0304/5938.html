<em>&gt; This is getting to the core idea.  Suppose that you had been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member of a small Indian tribe, say the Menominee, to be specific.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You grow up noticing that many people have a peculiar loyalty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Menominee, and even join in raids that you had opposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against other tribes.  You moreover note that many seem to value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the *existence* of the tribe in a way that transcended the particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of the tribe---that is, they value the traditions and mores
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Menominee, and that it was *not* though any allegiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to various abstract principles that command their loyalty to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribe.  Rather they feel that way about Menominee as members of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *group*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that you would have found this alien to your way
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Now, yes.  Hypothetically in some other then and there?  Who can 
<br>
say?  I can only speak from with a more modern here and now 
<br>
where I grew up with the ideals of liberty and a lot of 
<br>
self-determination in mulitple areas of life.  I did not grow up 
<br>
in one small tribe with little knowledge of other possibilities 
<br>
and little incentive to think more abstractly and to choose.
<br>
<p>But you might say I have similar depth of loyalty to 
<br>
philosophies, groups, circumstances that are copacetic to people 
<br>
like me and tend to produce and promote people like me.  So on 
<br>
an abstract level, that is a similarity to the member of the 
<br>
small tribe.
