</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies of MS software will be recognized as &quot;trusted for this machine&quot;.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there will be legal, rather than technical, requirements that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent you from using those tools to analyse their software.  (And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical restrictions that make it very difficult.)  The effect will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same, but the illusion of freedom will be less thoroughly disrupted.
</em><br>
<p>I generally don't use Microsoft software to create programs on 
<br>
even Windows machines except for the OS.  I usually code and 
<br>
debug under emacs, cygwin, Java or C++ or Python or Lisp/Scheme 
<br>
and tools like JSwat and Eclipse.  I don't see any need to use 
<br>
MS software in that loop and do not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, if I read the XP EULA correctly (IANAL), MS is already claiming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of any files created with it's programs (sort of... I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's claiming to own the contents), and it's claiming the right to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;add, copy, modify, delete, or remove&quot; any of them without notice to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owner of the system.  
</em><br>
<p>This is one of many reasons that I do not and will not use XP.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This was *probably* put in so that they couldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be sued when their auto-update system scragged a computer, but now that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's there it leads to all sorts of interesting interpretations.  E.g., 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that under the DMCA it's technically illegal to &quot;use a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumvention measure&quot; (e.g. Open Office) to evade the (sorry, I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember the language) to read your own files by anything by an MS 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program. 
</em><br>
<p>Which is of course absurd and should be laughed completely off 
<br>
the market.  The idea that my content is not mine to read and 
<br>
use in any way I see fit simply because I used an MS or other 
<br>
brand X tool to enter it is outrageous.  I stay away from any MS 
<br>
formats not already sufficiently useable with other tools as 
<br>
much as possible.  My content does not belong to MS.  It is one 
<br>
of the evils of DMCA to say or arguably imply otherwise.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is under my understanding of the XP license.  (I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own it, and wouldn't agree with it, and it's illegal for anyone to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce a copy for display, so all I have to go on are brief snippets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken out of context.  This means I could likely be wrong.  But I see no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to give them benefit of the doubt.  They've got a bad history to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live down.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is illegal to display a copy of a license?  Since when?  On 
<br>
what grounds would you be prosecuted if you did so?
<br>
<p>I agree with your conclusion wholeheartedly.
