<em>&gt; &gt; So what is there to support the Self Sampling Assumption?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's start with this example (I'm making this example up as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I write): 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You and 99 other people are standing shoulder to shoulder in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a line. Someone from behind the line places green or yellow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hats on the heads of everyone in the line, including you. You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and everyone else in the line are now sporting a hat, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none of you know which color of hat you have, and none of you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know the colors of the hats of others. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All you know is that 90% of the hats are green.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now someone asks you to guess the color of your own hat. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you guess green? Of course you would. You would reason 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that given that you are a random sample of the 100 people in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the line, and that given that 90% of the hats are green, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are very likely to be wearing a green hat. You made this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess using the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA). And you were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to make that guess.
</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting example, but can you think of one more
<br>
realistic?
<br>
<p>As far as this example goes, I would guess that I was wearing a green
<br>
hat if I had no other information whatsoever, but I would recognize
<br>
that it was an extremely weak guess.
<br>
<p>Why?  Because the distribution of hats is probably not random.  It
<br>
depends on the behavior of the person handing them out.  That person
<br>
may be giving yellow hats to all the bald men, and green hats to
<br>
everyone else, or using any other criteria.  If I knew that the person
<br>
handing out the hats was really doing so randomly, then green would be
<br>
a stronger guess.  But until I know what the distribution pattern is,
<br>
all of my guesses are weak.
<br>
<p>The same problem holds for the Doomsday Argument.  Whether or not a
<br>
species goes extinct is not random.  It depends upon qualities of that
<br>
species.  So any guess as to humanity's future based on an assumption
<br>
that a human Doomsday is random is going to be a very weak guess.  It
<br>
comes back to what Rafal and Harvey said in the other branch of the
<br>
thread - we just don't have enough information for DA to be useful.
<br>
<p>cheers,
