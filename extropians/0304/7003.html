<p><em>&gt; For sure! That is why we need a chemist or chemical engineer to validate this

</em><br>
<p>It isn't entirely implausable.  I'd like to see more about how the
<br>
chemistry works.  The &quot;offal&quot; it seems should consist of DNA, proteins and
<br>
fats.  Now the &quot;fats&quot; are easy since they are more or less C-14 to C-20
<br>
chains.  Though there are some glycerophospholipids at the ends of the
<br>
chains that one would need to break up.  So I could see a process that
<br>
converts them into &quot;oil&quot; (hydrocarbon chains).  But the proteins have an
<br>
N-H group derived from an amino (NH2) between every amino acid in the
<br>
protein chain.  Most cell membranes have a significant protein content
<br>
40-60%.  That is on top of the proteins that are not in the cell
<br>
membranes.  Resolving this would seem to require breaking the proteins
<br>
back into amino acids, stripping off the amino group and then reassembling
<br>
carbon chains. DNA is much more difficult.
<br>
<p>So either they are losing a lot of the material in the process
<br>
or there is some really fancy chemistry going on that isn't
<br>
immediately obvious.
<br>
<p>But the article does sound detailed enough that it isn't
<br>
completely unbelievable.
