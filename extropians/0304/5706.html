</em><br>
<p>Sure. I was all for centralised control of most things when I joined the
<br>
list. Now I understand and embrace individualist philosophy, which once upon
<br>
a time I did not. I still believe that there is a place for public goods of
<br>
many kinds, and for social services, which a pure market approach wont
<br>
address. I also am unconvinced that the market is the best way of doing
<br>
decentralised organisation (although I don't have a viable alternative, so I
<br>
am willing to roll over on that for now). 
<br>
<p>But a big change for me is to see the proper role of government as service
<br>
provider rather than as parent; that the individual should be responsible
<br>
for his/her life, not the state. It's a rather profound change in outlook,
<br>
and I'd attribute it almost entirely to the influence of the list.
