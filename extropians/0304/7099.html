<p><em>&gt; Perhaps what we need, then, is for someone to write &quot;The Extropic Good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Life: Living independently in an increasingly co-dependent world.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Maybe I should write about my experiences in the Sand Hills of Central
<br>
Texas
<br>
on an income that was low enough to avoid all federal income and self
<br>
employment (social security &amp; medicare) taxes. I had very fresh food,
<br>
electricity, running water, satellite TV, Internet service -- all the modern
<br>
conveniences, and money left over to buy books and best of all, time to read
<br>
them. Also got plenty of exercise without even thinking about it.
<br>
<p>I'm making far more money now, and it's nice to let the city water company
<br>
take care of repairing the purification system and pumps instead of having
<br>
to do it myself; but I can't say that my life now is better in every
<br>
respect.&quot;
<br>
___________________
<br>
<p>The irony of it all!  Now, you are really living an extropic good life -
<br>
healthy, beauty, $$, and happiness.  
<br>
<p>I just read a section of a book by a one of the A-4M Conference execs.  He
<br>
wrote a test that reveals the quality level of life a person is living and
<br>
how long he will live.  Sounds a bit dorky, but I took the test. The basics
<br>
really ring out loud and clear - do what you love, get a good night sleep,
<br>
stop worrying, have a animal companion (pet), a lover (not necessarily in
<br>
that order), money coming in, insurance, etc.
<br>
<p>I like the flush on the toilet much better than my retreat in the Colorado
<br>
mountains which had no taxes, water or toilet.  It was fun then, but this
<br>
is much more accommodating :-)
