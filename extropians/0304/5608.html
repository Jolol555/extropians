<p><em>&gt; I assume the term Anders was refraining from saying

<p>Olga continues
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As if links to Pat Buchanan, Phyllis Schlafly and Ann
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, they're not.  I don't consider any of those individuals
<br>
to be racists.  I do disagree with Pat Buchanan about a lot
<br>
of things.  But what is the worst thing your or the others
<br>
have found?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; how about this delectable morsel from the vdare.com site (regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 14-year-old boy in 1955 who was killed in the summer of 1955 for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;what would now be called sexual harassment of a white woman&quot;)?:
</em><br>
<p>Good.  Something specific.  I assume, Olga, that the following is
<br>
from that web site somewhere:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; VDARE.COM does not, as it happens, advocate lynching. But it cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; denied that Till was lynched for what would now be called the sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; harassment of a white woman.  And elementary math suggests that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; almost five decades since his death, up to 1.5 million white women may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been raped by blacks.
</em><br>
<p>Is this typical?  I *would* consider that racist.  After all,
<br>
where are the corresponding figures for black on black, white
<br>
on black and white on white?  Besides, from your link,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the story of the Emmett Till incident:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html">http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>I didn't see anything about &quot;sexual harassment at all&quot;.  Looked 
<br>
just like an old-fashioned lynching.
