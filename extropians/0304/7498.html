</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would *not* answer 1/3.
</em><br>
<p>Rafal replies:
<br>
<em>&gt; 1/2 ?
</em><br>
<p>The answer depends very much on your prior beliefs, as it should in a
<br>
good Bayesian problem.  What do you think the mathematician's motives
<br>
are in asking this question?  What might he have asked differently in
<br>
other circumstancs?  How equal-minded is he with respect to the sexes?
<br>
<p>Depending on the answers to these questions, I could see the answer
<br>
plausibly ranging between 1/2 and 1/3.
<br>
<p>The &quot;classic&quot; answer to this puzzle is 1/3.  The reasoning is that if
<br>
all we knew was that he had two kids, they could equally be girl-girl,
<br>
girl-boy, boy-girl, or boy-boy.  Once he tells you that at least one
<br>
is a boy, that elminates girl-girl, leaving the remaining three with
<br>
equal probability.  Therefore the chance that he has boy-boy is 1/3.
<br>
<p>The problem is that this reasoning assumes that he would pose the puzzle
<br>
in exactly these terms for any of the last three cases.  In particular,
<br>
if he has a boy and a girl, you have to assume that he would definitely
<br>
have said, &quot;...and at least one of them is a boy.&quot;  In other words,
<br>
you have to assume that he is a male chauvinist who views boys as more
<br>
important than girls.
<br>
<p>If on the other hand he is a sexual egalitarian, then if he had a boy and
<br>
a girl he might have said, &quot;...and at least one of them is a girl.&quot;  If we
<br>
assume that in those cases there was a 50-50 chance that he might have
<br>
said &quot;boy&quot; or &quot;girl&quot;, that gives us stronger reason to believe in boy-boy.
<br>
Only with boy-boy would he have certainly have said &quot;boy&quot;; with boy-girl
<br>
or girl-boy there was only a 50% chance he would have used that word.  This
<br>
reasoning leads to an overall chance for boy-boy of 1/2.
<br>
<p>Or you could make other assumptions; maybe he is more likely
<br>
to pose the puzzle if he does have two boys, since he knows that
<br>
mathematically-trained acquaintances will be likely to guess wrong.
<br>
In that case the probability might be even greater than 1/2.  It all
<br>
depends on your priors.
