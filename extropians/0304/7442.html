<p><em>&gt;&gt; If SSA is false then DA fails immediately, but then so do a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; common sense ideas that we take as obvious fact. And therein 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lies the rub.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what is there to support the Self Sampling Assumption?
</em><br>
<p>Let's start with this example (I'm making this example up as I write): 
<br>
<p>You and 99 other people are standing shoulder to shoulder in a line. Someone
<br>
from behind the line places green or yellow hats on the heads of everyone in
<br>
the line, including you. You and everyone else in the line are now sporting
<br>
a hat, but none of you know which color of hat you have, and none of you
<br>
know the colors of the hats of others. 
<br>
<p>All you know is that 90% of the hats are green.
<br>
<p>Now someone asks you to guess the color of your own hat. 
<br>
<p>Would you guess green? Of course you would. You would reason that given that
<br>
you are a random sample of the 100 people in the line, and that given that
<br>
90% of the hats are green, you are very likely to be wearing a green hat.
<br>
You made this guess using the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA). And you were
<br>
right to make that guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In particular, what is there to support the assumption that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are a random sample from a population that includes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *future* sentients not yet born?
</em><br>
<p>Okay, now imagine that 1,000,000,000 people will join the line at some
<br>
distant future time. Everyone will lose their hats at that future time, but
<br>
everyone will then be given new hats in the same ratio of green to yellow.
<br>
After those people are added and given hats you will be asked once again to
<br>
guess the color of your own hat. Someone asks you now (before the extra
<br>
people are added) if you plan to change your guess from green to yellow.
<br>
Will you change your guess? Of course not. 90% of all people ever to join
<br>
the line will have green hats. You will continue to abide by the
<br>
Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA) even despite the fact that most people 
<br>
in the sample are not yet born.
<br>
