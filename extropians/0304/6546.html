<p>It may be true that we 20th and 21st century humans are near to the height
<br>
of our paleolithic ancestors, thanks to advances in medicine and nutrition,
<br>
but the evidence is that farmers in general were much shorter than their
<br>
prehistoric ancestors at least until very recently. I'll need to find the
<br>
proper sources in the bibliography of Dr. Cordain's on book on paleodiets to
<br>
give you an academic reference, but here is what he says on page 42:
<br>
<p>&quot;The archeological record clearly shows that whenever and wherever ancient
<br>
humans sowed seeds, (and replaced the old animal-dominated diets), part of
<br>
the harvest included health problems. One physical ramification of the new
<br>
diet was immediately obvious: Early farmers were markedly shorter than their
<br>
ancestors. In Turkey and Greece, for example, pre-agricultural men stood 5
<br>
feet 9 inches tall and women 5 feet 5 inches. By 3000 B.C., the average man
<br>
had shrunk to 5 feet 3 inches and the average woman to 5 feet. But getting
<br>
shorter -- not in itself a health problem -- was the least of the changes in
<br>
these early farmers. Studies of their bone and teeth reveal that these
<br>
people were basically a mess. They had more infectious diseases, more
<br>
childhood mortality, and shorter life-spans in general. They also had more
<br>
osteoporosis, rickets, and other bone mineral disorders thanks to their
<br>
cereal based diets... Instead of the well-formed, strong teeth their
<br>
ancestors had, there were now cavities. Their jaws, which were formerly
<br>
square and roomy, were suddenly too small for their teeth, which overlapped
<br>
each other.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I've seen reference also to studies of mummies unearthed in ancient
<br>
(agricultural) Egypt. Ancient Egyptians were also a mess. 
<br>
<p>The point is this: if it is true that we are healthier today than we were in
<br>
pre-agricultural times, then it is true despite the modern diet -- not
<br>
because of it.
