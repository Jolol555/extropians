<p><em>&gt; Well, here I think the amazon review you mentioned did a

</em><br>
<p>Yes of course, the tendency to warfare and violence is part of human nature
<br>
then and now. Again I was objecting only to the idea that the naive hunting
<br>
of a species to extinction is evidence of that destructive nature. Are you
<br>
really suggesting Diamond thinks it is? Or are you stating that the amazon
<br>
reviewer was flatly mistaken to call it Diamond's view? I'm sorry your
<br>
message is not very clear to me in this respect.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Really if you think about it, this is a very extropian idea.  It's
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I can agree with this. (On the other hand memes should evolve faster
<br>
then genes, so I'd like to believe we've made at least some progress on this
<br>
score since the paleolithic. Unfortunately recent international news does
<br>
not seem to support my optimism.)
