<p>
As Extropians, I hope that we can strive to avoid falling into the same
<br>
tired patterns of debate which can be found in virtually every forum on
<br>
the net.  The recent argument about policy towards Iraq is a good example
<br>
of how not to conduct online debates, in my opinion.  We saw name calling,
<br>
we saw heated back-and-forth arguments, heavy drawing of ideological
<br>
lines, hardening of positions, all the typical side effects of hard
<br>
fought political battles.  These discussions took up a tremedous amount
<br>
of time and effort and largely monopolized this list for months at a time.
<br>
<p>And it wasn't even a particularly Extropian topic, except in the broad
<br>
sense that the politics of the future will affect many aspects of our
<br>
lives.  It's not like our discussions made any difference in the world.
<br>
No one involved in the U.N. debates or the national decision-making
<br>
apparatus checked to see what the Extropians thought.  We were just
<br>
blowing off steam, filling the world with more hot air.
<br>
<p>As I watched these arguments (they don't even really deserve to be
<br>
called debates - fights might be a better word), I kept wondering if
<br>
there couldn't be a better way, some approach which would incorporate our
<br>
Extropian values.  Even if the topics were not particularly Extropian,
<br>
couldn't we at least go about things in a distinctive way?  Could we do
<br>
something that said, this argument is among Extropians, people with a
<br>
certain unique perspective.  Could these threads of discussion acquire
<br>
traits which would distinguish them from the identical arguments about
<br>
Iraq which could be found all over the web?
<br>
<p>I don't have a full answer to this question, and I certainly didn't want
<br>
to raise the topic while everyone's blood was hot and their thinking
<br>
dulled by ideology.  But now things have calmed down a little, and I
<br>
think we could all look back at that frenzied period and consider how
<br>
we could have done better.
<br>
<p>We have had many discussions in the past on ways to understand the world,
<br>
mental toolkits which offer the possibility of reduced error and deeper
<br>
understanding.  E-prime, pancritical rationalism, meta-rationality, and
<br>
many other ideas have been discussed.  But in the face of the intensity
<br>
and vitriol of the recent arguments, it's hard to see how to begin to
<br>
apply such techniques.
<br>
<p>I'm thinking of something simpler.  It goes back to Eric Drexler's
<br>
advocacy in Engines of Creation of what he calls a Fact Forum,
<br>
<a href="http://www.foresight.org/EOC/EOC_Chapter_13.html">http://www.foresight.org/EOC/EOC_Chapter_13.html</a>.  This is a variation
<br>
on the invention of Arthur Kantrowitz which was dubbed a Science Court.
<br>
But it's a complicated procedure and requires an expert jury, a
<br>
judge/referee, and a fairly formal process.
<br>
<p>I also thought of Robin Hanson's paper on Futarchy, his proposal to
<br>
use an Idea Futures market to make predictions which would guide the
<br>
electorate as it set policies.  <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html</a>.
<br>
It too is a complicated system and not one we could incorporate.
<br>
<p>But all of these proposals start the same way, and it is this starting
<br>
point which I think would be a good step forward for us.  The idea
<br>
is simple: separate facts from values.  We see this in the title of
<br>
Robin's essay: &quot;Futarchy: Vote Values, But Bet Beliefs&quot;, and in the
<br>
title of Drexler's chapter: &quot;Finding the Facts&quot;.  These proposals, and
<br>
the Science Court, start with the premise that we must separate out our
<br>
disagreements on matters of fact from our disagreements about values,
<br>
about how we judge those facts.
<br>
<p>The theory is that when people disagree, there are two relatively distinct
<br>
components to the disagreement.  One part is their disagreement about
<br>
factual matters: facts in the past, present and future.  What happened
<br>
before?  What is happening now?  And if we take various actions, what
<br>
will happen in the future?  Based on their differing understandings of
<br>
the world, people will typically have many disagreements about factual
<br>
matters like these.
<br>
<p>Then, logically independent from factual disagreements, are differences
<br>
in values.  What situations are good?  What outcomes should we strive
<br>
to attain, and which ones should we avoid?  How much better is outcome
<br>
A than B, and how does that compare to the differences between C and D?
<br>
<p>We can all recognize that both components come into play to varying
<br>
degrees in disagreements.  Sometimes people may largely share values but
<br>
disagree strongly on a factual issue.  Other times people may expect
<br>
roughly the same factual state but disagree on whether that is a good
<br>
or bad result.  And sometimes they will disagree both on the facts and
<br>
on how to value them.
<br>
<p>The reason this decomposition can help to make for more productive
<br>
argumentation is that factual matters are, in principle, subject to
<br>
verification, while values are not.  Thinking about problems in this
<br>
way helps us to identify the areas where discussion can be productive.
<br>
There's not much point in trying to change someone's values.  Those are
<br>
generally relatively fixed, and while they may change to some degree
<br>
it is likely to be a slow process.  Factual differences are much more
<br>
amenable to argument and discussion.
<br>
<p>As I watched some of the Iraq debate, it was often very difficult
<br>
to identify which disputes were based on facts and which were based
<br>
on values.  Everything was all mixed together as the (roughly) two
<br>
ideological camps went at each other with every memetic weapon available.
<br>
I doubt that even the participants were aware in most cases whether
<br>
they were arguing facts or values, or whether their differences with
<br>
the other side were more in one category or the other.
<br>
<p>The lesson I take from this, and from people like Eric Drexler, Arthur
<br>
Kantrowitz and Robin Hanson, is that the first step in beginning a debate
<br>
ought to be identifying areas of factual dispute.  It might be that the
<br>
factual differences are much less than you think!  Or maybe there are
<br>
huge factual gaps, which suggests the hope at least that the argument
<br>
can come to some kind of conclusion.  In some cases it might even make
<br>
sense to set up an Idea Futures claim about a factual dispute, at the
<br>
online site for the Foresight Exchange game, <a href="http://www.ideosphere.com">http://www.ideosphere.com</a>.
<br>
This can give a relatively objective estimate of the likelihood of a
<br>
future outcome.  Maybe someday we'll even have real money Idea Futures
<br>
markets that could really help to pin things down.
<br>
<p>So that's my proposal for improving our argumentation.  Next time we
<br>
fall into the trap of ideological battle here, let's step back and ask,
<br>
what are the factual differences?  Let each side list the facts which
<br>
they see as most important.  Then they can identify areas of agreement
<br>
or (more likely) focus on where they disagree.  But at least they'll
<br>
be arguing about facts.  That opens up the possibility for many other
<br>
strategies for getting at the truth.  And we know that at least there
<br>
is a truth to get at, which isn't the case for value disagreements.
<br>
<p>I hope that the hostile tone of many of our recent discussions will
<br>
motivate us to look for a new way to manage disagreements.  As Extropians,
<br>
we shouldn't be satisfied with debates that are just like everyone else's,
<br>
on the same topics that everyone else is fighting about, and with the same
<br>
kinds of unproductive argumentation tactics.  We should try something new.
<br>
We could hardly do any worse than we have.
<br>
