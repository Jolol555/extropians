<p>I would strongly suggest *not* going there (in attempting to make sense
<br>
of this at this time).
<br>
<p>Yes the mitochondria produce free radicals -- this appears to be related
<br>
to the &quot;throughput&quot; of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [when it gets
<br>
backed up more free radicals get generated] -- but one of the life-extending
<br>
mutations in C. elegans involves insufficient Co-Q9 or Co-Q10 (so the
<br>
mitochondrial transport chains get backed up, do suffer reduced transport
<br>
capacity and perhaps greater free radical generation.  But this may be
<br>
offset by the reduced ATP generation (effectively CR).  But then in mammals
<br>
you have the uncoupling proteins (which serve to facilitate heat production and
<br>
would reduce the backup in the mitochondrial transport chains)  (I posted
<br>
extensively about this probably about a year ago).  But they might generate more free
<br>
radicals if the free radical production is an inherent part of the respiratory
<br>
glucose/oxygen consumption process.  (I.e. more heat == more free radicals).
<br>
But then the free radicals could be offset by anti-oxidants such as
<br>
estrogen or alpha-lipoic acid that may not be present in large quantities
<br>
in more primitive organisms.
<br>
<p>If one wades into this one is wading into one of the most complex
<br>
intellectual problems I'm aware of -- and given the state of our
<br>
knowledge base I personally don't think resolving it isn't going
<br>
to be pretty.
<br>
<p>Go relax on the beach -- let the grad students that actually
<br>
need to debate these things deal with it.
<br>
