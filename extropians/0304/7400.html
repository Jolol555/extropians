</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're from one machine or the other (you can never see balls 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that come later in number than you).  
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe the analogy breaks down for the reason you cite. All you
<br>
know initially is that 1) you are a ball, that 2) there are two sequences of
<br>
balls, one long and one short, and that 3) you come from one of those two
<br>
sequences. You look at your birth order and see that you are ball #4 in your
<br>
sequence. The question then is: &quot;Am I from the short sequence or from the
<br>
long sequence?&quot; 
<br>
<p>It is reasonable to conclude that you came probably from the short sequence,
<br>
because the probability of finding yourself to be the 4th ball in the long
<br>
sequence is small by comparison. 
<br>
<p>There is a key idea in my last sentence, that of &quot;finding oneself.&quot;  You
<br>
&quot;found yourself&quot; to be #4 in your sequence. Implicit in the idea of finding
<br>
yourself to be #4 is the assumption that *in principle* you could have found
<br>
yourself to have been any number in either sequence, i.e., that your
<br>
observation of your birth order is a random sample of birth order
<br>
observations taken from the population of observations from which yours is
<br>
drawn. This is the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA) upon with all of DA theory
<br>
rests. If SSA is false then DA fails immediately, but then so do a lot of
<br>
common sense ideas that we take as obvious fact. And therein lies the rub.
