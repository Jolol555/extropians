</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, they're not.  I don't consider any of those individuals

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>The word &quot;racist&quot; is a cliche, and is therefore useless as a tool for 
<br>
discussion of issues.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; how about this delectable morsel from the vdare.com site (regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the 14-year-old boy in 1955 who was killed in the summer of 1955 for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;what would now be called sexual harassment of a white woman&quot;)?:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Good.  Something specific.  I assume, Olga, that the following is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from that web site somewhere:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; VDARE.COM does not, as it happens, advocate lynching. But it cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; denied that Till was lynched for what would now be called the sexual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; harassment of a white woman.  And elementary math suggests that, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; almost five decades since his death, up to 1.5 million white women may 
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; been raped by blacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is this typical?  I *would* consider that racist.  After all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where are the corresponding figures for black on black, white
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on black and white on white?  Besides, from your link,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is the story of the Emmett Till incident:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html">http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I didn't see anything about &quot;sexual harassment at all&quot;.  Looked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just like an old-fashioned lynching.
</em><br>
<p><p>I am not sure what the incident discussed here is about, but vdare generally 
<br>
sticks its nose into socially taboo areas, such immigration (its main 
<br>
concern), multicultural diversity, race, etc.  That is what I love about 
<br>
vdare--they address issues that political correctness has deemed out of 
<br>
bounds for political discussion.
<br>
<p>Sheep can only lob pre-programmed ad homs.  Wannabe posthumans actively seek 
<br>
out discussion of important issues that society at large ignores.
