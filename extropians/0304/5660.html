<p>Ø The point needs to be made over and over that the pre-1989

<p><p>To which Damien Sullivan responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;No, the West thought it was fighting for its life. After 1991 it became 
<br>
clear
<br>
the Soviet Union was a paper tiger. Okay, a paper tiger with nukes, but its
<br>
economic power had been vastly overestimated.&quot;
<br>
<p>To dismiss the Soviet Union as &quot;a paper tiger&quot; is beyond insulting. I am 
<br>
astonished that someone that I must view as being quite intelligent (given 
<br>
your presence on this list) would so cavalierly dismiss the deaths of 
<br>
millions of people due to the direct and indirect actions of the Soviet 
<br>
Union. They or their proxy's actions within the borders of the USSR, East 
<br>
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Korea, Ethiopia and 
<br>
many other countries brought untold misery to hundreds of millions of people. 
<br>
It is not responsible to label the Cold War as a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; or any 
<br>
other such nonsense. The Soviet Union sought a world dominated by Communism, 
<br>
and did its best to inflict its brutal system upon as many people as 
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>&quot;And there wasn't that much fighting, more jockeying for status and 
<br>
influence.&quot;
<br>
<p>Given the conflicts which occurred in Afghanistan, Vietnam, Korea, Ethiopia, 
<br>
Greece, Angola et al, how much war and loss of life is required for there to 
<br>
be &quot;much fighting&quot; in your view?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The choice, as Max Plumm has eloquently explained, was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;tyranny&quot; in a developing country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but between &quot;pro-U.S. authoritarianism&quot; and &quot;pro-Soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarianism&quot; in those places. It's still an open
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I consider that unproven. Greece wandered between democracy and
<br>
authoritarianism.&quot;
<br>
<p>As I illustrated in my last post to you, it is highly dubious to suggest that 
<br>
Greece would've been capable of &quot;wandering between democracy and 
<br>
authoritarianism&quot; had the United States allowed the Soviet proxies in that 
<br>
country to emerge victorious in their civil war.
<br>
<p>&quot;Costa Rica has been democratic for a long long time.&quot;The rest of Latin 
<br>
America was having trouble with democracy since long before Communism; it's 
<br>
not clear what the latter had to do with anything.&quot;
<br>
<p>I must strongly disagree, if there is one thing that is crystal clear it is 
<br>
that a Communist system eliminates any chance at democracy. In regard to the 
<br>
struggles of Latin America with democracy, the same can be said of Africa, 
<br>
which is precisely why I have attempted to illustrate that the United States 
<br>
cannot be criticized for dealing with authoritarians during the Cold War. The 
<br>
vast majority of democratic experiments during this era failed. However, it 
<br>
should be noted that many that succeeded were allowed to prosper in large 
<br>
part because of actions by the United States.
<br>
<p>&quot;Apart from us helping to overthrow democratically elected left-leaning 
<br>
governments such as Allende.&quot;
<br>
<p>Despite our past decisions in Chile, which I explained in more depth in my 
<br>
last post, the people of Chile today do enjoy democracy, and have since 1988. 
<br>
As I've mentioned, the United States is the reason there is democracy today 
<br>
in South Korea and Taiwan. Please provide ONE example of where the Soviet 
<br>
Union brought or fostered democracy in its many proxies. Again, to simply 
<br>
dismiss that it is easy for us to have a better record abroad than the Soviet 
<br>
Union ignores the entire point of why the Cold War was waged.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh, India's another counterexample. Definitely still developing, but
<br>
democratic since independence, and leading the Nonaligned Bloc.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;Or Iran, which after 1979 was neither pro-US authoritarian nor pro-Soviet 
<br>
totalitarian.
<br>
Maybe getting some aid from the USSR, but mostly going its own theocratic 
<br>
way.&quot;
<br>
<p>How do these examples invalidate the Cold War? Neither the USSR, nor the 
<br>
United States, had infinite resources with which to wage their ideological 
<br>
conflict in every country of the globe. The Nazis did not conquer Zimbabwe 
<br>
before or during World War II, does that mean they were not seeking world 
<br>
domination? The goal of the United States in the Cold War was not to spread 
<br>
democracy in every nation (which would have been impossible), it was to 
<br>
prevent the spread of Communism. That being said, we still fostered and made 
<br>
possible the spread of democracy in places where it otherwise would not have 
<br>
occurred. That cannot be said for the Soviets, who willingly suppressed the 
<br>
spread of democracy in every instance.
<br>
<p>&quot;Lebanon was roughly democratic until the Syrians moved in, and possibly
<br>
Israel's interference didn't help either.&quot;
<br>
<p>You only aid my position with this example. The United States sent troops 
<br>
into Lebanon to &quot;prop up&quot; the democratically elected Chamoun government in 
<br>
1958. It was not until the 1970s when the Soviet proxies, the Syrians, 
<br>
entered that country that democracy was undone. But this gets to the heart of 
<br>
the matter. Do you suggest that the goals and aims of the democratic United 
<br>
States and Israel during the Cold War were of the same merit and validity of 
<br>
the totalitarian Soviet Union and Syria?
<br>
<p>&quot;I now consider the dichtomy not just unproven but rather dubious.&quot;
<br>
<p>In what sense? You have acknowledged that you agree with the assertion that 
<br>
democracies were the exception and not the rule of the Cold War world. And, 
<br>
to my knowledge, you have as of yet not illustrated where the Soviet camp 
<br>
spread democracy, nor proven that they did not willingly suppress it 
<br>
throughout the globe. I somehow doubt that the peoples of West Germany, South 
<br>
Korea, or Greece, among others, would share in your conclusion.
