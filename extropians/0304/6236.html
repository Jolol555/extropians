<em>&gt; We are finding evidence every day, much of which is reported in the US

</em><br>
<em>&gt; full of barrels labeled &quot;Mustard&quot; and &quot;Tabun&quot; is a slight smoking gun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finding an underground lab on the same site that UN inspectors had

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>True.  But the converse also applies.  Mike, when will you learn to stop
<br>
putting your foot in your mouth?  The U.S. has announced so many smoking
<br>
guns that later didn't pan out, that I am not sure why anybody would listen
<br>
to us anymore.  Your next sentence makes a lot more sense for everybody:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before shooting off at the mouth, I suggest you wait for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehensive report from the DoD. I expect they intend to lay it all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in one big report that will thoroughly discredit the UN as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institution capable of weapons monitoring.
</em><br>
<p>In reality, there is ample evidence on both sides of this debate, and none
<br>
of it is final yet.  I can't blame anybody on /either/ side for believing as
<br>
they do.  We are getting so much propaganda, spin, false stories, and
<br>
mistaken stories, that everybody on all sides are getting plenty of support
<br>
for their beliefs.  I really hope the U.S. does produce this final official
<br>
report showing specific smoking guns.  If we don't, we will never be trusted
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>(And many people, even on this list, don't tend to trust big governments
<br>
anyway.  It really is a change to see people saying that we have to trust
<br>
big government and that is wouldn't lie to us.)  The U.S. has set up a lot
<br>
of expectation for results, evidence and proof.  I hope we don't fail to
<br>
deliver or appear to have been lying to the entire world.  This gambit of
<br>
being the world's policeman will either go extremely well for the U.S.
<br>
politically, or will go very badly.  World opinion won't remain divided or
<br>
on the fence indefinitely.
