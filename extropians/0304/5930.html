Eliezer writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, even in those million-to-one duplication events I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; described, I'd prefer all my duplicates to go to the preferred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; event.  Yet if it's a choice between me *not* getting a duplicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; made, and having it made in an inconvenient location, I'll choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the latter.  The ratio of outcomes is not the right way to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at this---what is correct is the total run time I get, and that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why probability also is not appropriate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Total run time&quot; seems to break down very fast in the presence of either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MWI or an open cosmos - your total run time is apparently increasing at an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponential rate of 10^150 branchings per second, within which a mere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twofold duplication would scarcely be noticed, or else is simply infinite. 
</em><br>
<p>No, I calculate &quot;total run time&quot; under MWI to be the same as the
<br>
total measure of the worlds.  The branching-process is one thing,
<br>
but the term &quot;branching&quot;, although used by David Deutsch, sometimes
<br>
conveys to people the mistaken impression that new universes come
<br>
into being, rather than old universes merely becoming distinguished.
<br>
The phrase &quot;consider a group of identical universes&quot; occurs in David
<br>
Deutsch's 1997 book &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot; many times.  He uses this
<br>
as a starting point whereupon the &quot;group&quot; undergo different events.
<br>
(This causes no small number of quite sophisticated people to imagine
<br>
that this implies that some members of the group must have already
<br>
been different to begin with.)
<br>
<p>So whereas my run time does not increase over time, (starting from
<br>
a group of identical universes), it does increase incrementally for
<br>
each duplicate that gets made.  If there is just one original, then
<br>
the creation of a duplicate does double the run time I get.
<br>
<p>In MWI, on the other hand, my actual run time constantly (and sadly)
<br>
diminishes, for in some worlds I will not complete this sentence
<br>
either because the valley I live in will be destroyed by an Iraqi
<br>
nuclear explosion (oops, sorry, I know how sensitive you are about war-
<br>
related threads  ;-),  or because a certain lamp on a high bookshelf
<br>
will fall and knock me unconscious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I *do* anticipate being in both places.  That's *why* I want a move rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; than a copy.  I *want* be in the grocery and I anticipate the frustration 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Eliezer who finds himself still at home.  When I snap my fingers I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; should just go where I want, dammit!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But the *moving* is inferior in most copy scenarios because you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less run time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Less run time&quot; seems a remarkably fragile concept.  The *relative* amount 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of runtime *this version* of you gets determines the *relative* weighting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this present in your past self's future.
</em><br>
<p>That seems right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You should care which future versions of you get the most runtime.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I hope that the versions of me that finish this sentence without
<br>
the telephone ringing get the most run time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But how can you tell whether your present has a &quot;little&quot; or a &quot;lot&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of runtime?  As far as I can tell, you cannot.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, the only way that I can even imagine guessing is to wonder about
<br>
how probable my (or even our) existence is.  I'm especially worried that
<br>
my mother was the last of ten children, and my father was fifth of six.
<br>
Yet this is a complex topic, because the way I look at who I am, there
<br>
are tentacled and tailed versions of me in other worlds that nonetheless
<br>
have so much in common with me (recall the bizarre similarities of
<br>
identical twins) that we are the same person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This leads me to propose that &quot;runtime&quot; is a relative quantity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used in renormalization of futures, rather than an absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantity that applies to the present.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (And then he gave a quiet, mysterious smile.)
</em><br>
<p>And I answer in a knowing--yet perhaps partly sardonic--nod and grin.
<br>
<p>Lee
