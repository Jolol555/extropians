<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Middle%20east%20--%20was%20a%20couple%20of%20other%20things">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a> writes:  It is neither Islam nor even poverty itself that

<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this misses the vital part of the analysis.  I not only read 
<br>
the middle eastern papers, lurk on one of their lists, and listen to middle 
<br>
eastern friends that like living in our country, I have also stood and had my 
<br>
country cussed out as the great Satan by middle easterners living in our 
<br>
country -- I wanted to know what they were thinking, in detail.  It was 
<br>
painful but I listened.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubting that some or them (or even the majority) most 
<br>
sincerely hate us with a passion that is murderous.  The question is why?  Is 
<br>
that hatred rational in the sense that we have done something to provoke 
<br>
their response?  If we have provoked their response, what was it that we did?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My answer is that sufficient information is available in the form of 
<br>
English language editions of middle eastern newspapers for us to understand 
<br>
what is going on if we only seek out the papers and read thoughtfully.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They let slip their opposition to allowing Iraq to live out from under 
<br>
the sanctions.  Why would they want sanctions to stay in place a fellow 
<br>
Moslem nation?  They let slip that they predict that if the sanctions are 
<br>
lifted it will cost middle eastern countries one trillion dollars in oil 
<br>
revenues over the next few years.  They reveal that the Iraqis hated the 
<br>
middle eastern fighters that came to help Sadaam so much that they shot those 
<br>
fighters in the back on enough occasions to make the same fighters antsy as 
<br>
could be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last piece of the puzzle takes a judgment.  If you read their 
<br>
papers you will see a constant unrelenting drive to slant every news article 
<br>
into an anti American rant.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lee, of all the middle eastern countries I am told not one is a 
<br>
democracy but instead every one of those countries has a totalitarian 
<br>
government of one kind or another.  It is plain to see that the conduct of 
<br>
the US is dangerous to the continued existence of their dictatorships at 
<br>
least in their eyes.  It is also plain that the governments are whipping up 
<br>
the man in the street to hate the Americans.  But, to find that out you have 
<br>
to go read their papers and hear their story at the level at which they talk 
<br>
to the man in their streets.  Amara, not withstanding, this can be done 
<br>
easily.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we don't go observe then we are caught in an incestuous debate 
<br>
among ourselves.  Every exchange referring only to a previous exchange 
<br>
between members of our group.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I asked a couple of questions.  Have we provoked their 
<br>
response and if so in what way?  After study I have to conclude that by 
<br>
simply being who we are we have seriously threatened the continuance of the 
<br>
dictatorships.  And, the dictators have retaliated and are continuing to 
<br>
retaliate.  We have also failed to communicate with the man in their streets 
<br>
except through Hollywood's export and the imitation product of their home 
<br>
grown entertainment industry.  We are not getting our story told.
<br>
Ron h.
