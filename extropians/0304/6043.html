<p>Not like they've vastly different from us in that respect.  People are dying

in North Korea, and we do close to nothing.  People are dying throughout the

Third World due to lack of food, water, hygiene, or medicine, and we don't do
<br>
much.  Actually many European countries give higher percentages of their GDP
<br>
as foreign aid than we do, and most of that won't be military aid like ours
<br>
is, so possibly over the decades they've done more to save human life than we
<br>
have.  And arguably any rich country which let Third World products in without
<br>
tariffs would do even more for those countries; that wouldn't be either the US
<br>
or the EU, though it might be Australia or New Zealand.  (Canada? don't know
<br>
where it stands on primary production tariffs.)
<br>
<p>And some say much of Iraq's suffering in the past decades is due to our
<br>
sanctions.  I don't know what to think myself.  &quot;It's not us, it's Saddam!
<br>
The UN hasn't banned these things!&quot;  &quot;No, it just puts indefinite holds on
<br>
them, which amounts to the same thing.&quot;

<p>Nasty though his regime is, just what are the numbers associated with it?

Just what is the total amount of bloodshed, and how does it compare against

other things in the world?
