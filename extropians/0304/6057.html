<em>&gt; &gt; I've never seen a society getting richer that got (internally) worse.
</em><br>
<p>Incidentally, that was a throw-away line.  I'm still eager
<br>
to hear about counter-examples, but it does indeed seem to
<br>
me over humanity's 10,000 year history that increases in
<br>
wealth are strongly correlated with increases in humanitarianism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'd rather a country be run by rich hoodlums that by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; poor hoodlums (except for the unfortunate out-country effects).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the historical cases I know of, namely the West, the &quot;elite&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we are discussing here who makes all the money does so with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more moral laxity than animates the general person in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population.  Surely you don't believe that the rich got their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; money because they're evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the key question here is &quot;What do you mean rich?&quot;.  You certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't talking about the amount of money, or one could accomplish this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily with inflation.
</em><br>
<p>No, but there is indeed such a thing as wealth.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My definition of rich would be &quot;the ability of people to acquire the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools to accomplish projects without expending their life in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquisition&quot;.  That's a bit flakey, and needs much more precision, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if people can't do things, then they aren't rich.  If only a few can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose what to do, then the society isn't rich, though those few people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be.  etc.  Land and other tangible property thus enters into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equation as one of the tools that allows one to accomplish the works 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one intends.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's close to what I would say, and what I think economics
<br>
texts say to define wealth. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Considering &quot;money&quot; here is a bit of misdirection.
</em><br>
<p>Well, what was meant is wealth, and the rich within a society
<br>
are those who amass the most.  For individuals it's usually can
<br>
be equated to the amount of gold they could convert their wealth
<br>
into, though no strict definition of this kind works.  (Which is
<br>
the usual case, when anything outside of math or physics is being
<br>
discussed.)
