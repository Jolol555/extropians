<p>There is reasonable fear of warmth because it is likely to cause the sea 
<br>
levels to rise, and we tend to build our cities along waterfronts.  
<br>
(Check out the recent Scientific American article on New Orleans for 
<br>
something already a bit shocking.)  There is unreasonable fear of warmth 
<br>
because people are afraid of changes.
<br>
There is reasonable dislike of warmth because it will drive many species 
<br>
to extinction (because we have them walled into immobile enclosures).  
<br>
There is unreasonable dislike of warmth because people are accustomed to 
<br>
the weather as it is.
<br>
<p>The is unreasonable acceptance of warmth, because people don't 
<br>
understand that after the oceans get warm, we will enter an ice age.  
<br>
(The lag time between warming air and earth, and warming oceans leads to 
<br>
some rather spectacular instabilities in the climate.)  Time frame?  
<br>
Sorry.  I don't know.  I've seen and been convince by a popularization 
<br>
of the climate model made decades ago (so I can't even point you to a 
<br>
reference).  The basic idea is that warm oceans =&gt; increased evaporation 
<br>
=&gt; increased percipitation =&gt; (some event) =&gt; massive blizzards =&gt; 
<br>
glaciers =&gt; ice age? =&gt; cold oceans =&gt; decreased evaporation =&gt; 
<br>
decreased percipitation =&gt; (some event) =&gt; snowfields melting =&gt; warmth 
<br>
=&gt; warm oceans =&gt; ...
<br>
This loop is supposed to break when the tectonic plates shift to a new 
<br>
location.
