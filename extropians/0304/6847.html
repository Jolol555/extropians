due
<br>

stop

</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the beneficiaries of the law (as in unionized workers).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know what this BS about coordination is all about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I do see that you are pointing out that for a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of workers, their wages will go up if it's mandated some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, or they achieve it some way through bargaining.
</em><br>
<p>### You might want to read about the coordination problem at
<br>
<a href="http://william-king.www.drexel.edu/top/eco/game/game.html">http://william-king.www.drexel.edu/top/eco/game/game.html</a>.
<br>
<p>The &quot;queuing game&quot; is quite enlightening.
<br>
<p>Formation of an effective monopoly does increase the potential income of the
<br>
monopolist compared to a competitve equilibrium. This is uncontroversial, I
<br>
hope?
<br>
<p>Due to the coordination problem it is not possible for workers to form a
<br>
monopoly. A legislative intervention *forces* them to behave like a
<br>
monopolist, increasing their income, initially.
<br>
<p>There is a difference between a labor union (which improves workers'
<br>
bargaining position), and a minimum wage law, which limits the scope of
<br>
bargaining, but in the long run both have the same destructive results.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,
<br>
<em>&gt; if tomorrow Bush passed an emergency measure (that he somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had the power to do) that said every teacher in the U.S. was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get a 50% pay increase, then indeed every teacher would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make more money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the long run, due to lower productivity, both the workers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the businesses, and the customers suffer, but this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  But what about the following *immediate* effect:  if all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the janitors in the U.S. get their wages doubled overnight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then fewer janitors are *immediately* with jobs.  Likewise, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all unions were busted tomorrow (by equally magical fiat), then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total number of employed persons would *immediately* go up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right?
</em><br>
<p>### Not immediately in the latter situation. BTW, you don't need to &quot;bust&quot;
<br>
labor unions, merely abolish the laws that mandate their formation. Most
<br>
labor unions would go out of business pretty quickly.
