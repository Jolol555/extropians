<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Are you going to address housing and the other implied

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;necessities or just harp on your understanding of food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;abundances (but not necessarily food prices).  If I have no home

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;severely limited and per unit of nutrition much more expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Are you going to attempt to say that the cost of living in say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;1970 dollars has not risen and risen dramatically in the last 32
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;If he doesn't, I will. Life is much better and cheaper than it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;was in 1970, by the only measure that matters: amount of labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;for goods comsumed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Indeed, it is better today than it has been at *any* time in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; throughout human history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh huh.  Pls explain why most Americans have no savings, why two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earner households are the norm and considered nearly required,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why a house costs me much more as a percentage of income, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in areas not so expensive than when in my father's time although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I make 25 times more than he did.  Standard of living is NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better now according to the studies I have seen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>All the available studies and evidence indicates as much.  You speak only
<br>
from personal anecdotes, can you cite any of these studies you have seen
<br>
that indictates standard of living is higher than ever before?  And then
<br>
explain to me how that can possibly jive with the fact that EVERYTHING,
<br>
every commodity, is cheaper now (in real dollars, or as a value of
<br>
man-hours-worked) then it has ever been before (with, as Lee Corbin noted,
<br>
the exception possibly of housing)
<br>
<p>As for your quesitons,
<br>
<p>1) why most Americans have no savings
<br>
- Because they dont save money up.
<br>
<p>2) why two earner households are the norm and considered nearly required,
<br>
- because everyone thinks they need to have a 3500 sf house with 2 SUV's, a
<br>
3 car garage, a 5,000 snow blower in case it snows twice a year, a $3,000
<br>
riding lawn mower, a waverunner or snowmobile (or both) 2 dogs, perhaps a
<br>
cat, a nice white picket fence, a perfect green lawn, 800/month day care so
<br>
the other parent can work to pay for that day care and that big house, a
<br>
swimming pool, a hot tub, a house phone line or two, a cell phone or four,
<br>
high speed internet, and 50 million other things that many people feel they
<br>
can not do without.  The main problem is people do not spend within their
<br>
means any longer.  I, personally, think the primary reason for this is the
<br>
proliferation of Credit Cards.  Where people can easily buy with money they
<br>
do not have.  I constantly encourage my friends and family to curb spending,
<br>
or at least not increase spending at the same rate that income increases.
<br>
No one seems to like that idea though.  Imagine for a moment how much extra
<br>
spending money you would have it if you only had a 500sf apt, heat, hot
<br>
water, clean water, and food.  Then start taking in the items above, and
<br>
youll see why two earner households are the norm.
<br>
<p>3)why a house costs me much more as a percentage of income
<br>
- that, as we have noted, is a more complicated question.  There is no doubt
<br>
that just about *everything* is cheaper, in real dollars, today than it has
<br>
been in the past.  The possibly exception, recently, being housing and I
<br>
suspect that regulations and more specifically zoning have a significant
<br>
influence on this problem.  Houses in my area, for instance, a rural wooded
<br>
area of CT, must be some 300 ft away from the property line of any other
<br>
persons property to build at.  The more densely populated area I used to
<br>
live in had a similiar zoning restriction, but it was some 150 feet or.  My
<br>
friends father was actually forced to move his *shed* because it was too
<br>
close to the neighbors propery.  Similiar restriction I am reasonable sure
<br>
exist anywhere in the US where people want to build things.  These
<br>
restrictions are all arbitrary, and only serve to further reduce the amount
<br>
of available land and obviously raise the price of that land.
