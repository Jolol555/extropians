</em><br>
<p>The chemistry makes sense.  A turkey or any other animal
<br>
is essentially long chain hydrocarbons.  It isn't such
<br>
a big trick to convert one to another.  But keep reading:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The &quot;offal&quot; it seems should consist of DNA, proteins and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fats.  Now the &quot;fats&quot; are easy since they are more or less C-14 to C-20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chains...
</em><br>
<p>Ja.  We are oil.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...DNA is much more difficult.
</em><br>
<p>Nah, the amount of the cell that is DNA is negligible.
<br>
Most of it is protoplasm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So either they are losing a lot of the material in the process
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately obvious...  Robert
</em><br>
<p>It looks like this could be done, however it seems to be
<br>
asking the wrong question.  They propose turning turkey
<br>
guts into oil.  How much is the end product worth?  I googled
<br>
and found that crude closed today at 25 bucks a barrel.
<br>
159 liters to the barrel?  So oil is worth less than
<br>
16 cents a liter.  How many substances can you think of
<br>
that can be purchased so cheaply as oil?
<br>
<p>Turkey guts are already balanced with the right elements
<br>
and minerals to be used to feed living organisms, so the
<br>
stuff can be ground up and added to livestock feed, used as
<br>
fertilizer, or hell, even use it to feed shrimp on the many
<br>
prawn farms that are springing up.  I can't see converting
<br>
*anything* that might have some value into something that
<br>
comes out of the ground free.  Oil is so cheap it is holding
<br>
back alternative energy sources.
