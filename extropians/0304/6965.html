re: list of mail-order sources of range-fed and wild-game meat and omega-3
<br>
enriched eggs
<br>
<p>I've received several requests for this list in private e-mail so I thought
<br>
I would post it.
<br>
<p>Wild game is of course the most paleolithic. Range-fed meats come close. The
<br>
corn-fed hormone-injected beef from the local supermarket is least like the
<br>
meats upon which we evolved, though personally I'm usually content to buy
<br>
lean cuts and trim any fat. 
<br>
<p>I often marinate my steaks in virgin olive oil and red wine, sometimes with
<br>
some additional spices. I would consider using flaxseed or cornola oil in my
<br>
marinade, both of which are even better than olive oil with respect to the
<br>
omega 3/6 balance, but I like the flavor of olive oil and it's hard to argue
<br>
with the Mediterraneans who are so healthy on a diet rich in olives and
<br>
olive oil. There may be some as yet undiscovered compounds in paleolithic
<br>
olives that help to preserve health. The red wine adds more flavor, and
<br>
possibly some antioxidant properties if the polyphenols aren't destroyed by
<br>
the heat of cooking. 
<br>
<p>These chicken farmers below sell omega-3 enriched eggs, which are
<br>
significantly better than ordinary supermarket eggs but not exactly the same
<br>
as eggs from range-fed chickens. Some major supermarkets already carry
<br>
omega-3 enriched eggs for a little more than the price of ordinary
<br>
non-enriched eggs produced by the larger farmers. True range-fed chickens
<br>
eat mostly insects; their eggs and meat provide an indirect but palatable
<br>
way for the paleodieter to get some of the possible benefits of paleolithic
<br>
insect foods. I'm aware of people who eat only the eggs from their own
<br>
range-fed chickens but I'm not aware of any commercial sources for them.
