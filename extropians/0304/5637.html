Hubert writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanx Emlyn for this revealing quote of Hermann Goering:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot; [...] the people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; danger. It works the  same way in any country.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Goering was not thinking of a country in which there was
<br>
freedom of expression.  Why should he?  He had never known
<br>
one, and from his perspective, the democracies were &quot;has
<br>
beens&quot; proven not to work (e.g. the Weimar republic).  Quite
<br>
the contrary, he saw how successful were the regimes of Hitler
<br>
and Stalin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dirty old man, today he could easily take over the position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the resigned Richard Perle.
</em><br>
<p>You'll have to enumerate the sins of Richard Perle to
<br>
have even a chance of making this charge stick.  Goering
<br>
was a Nazi, a war criminal, and acceded to plans for
<br>
genocide.  So what has one Richard Perle done lately
<br>
to compare with that?   Your exaggeration is completely
<br>
symptomatic of how you are taking current events.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But Schweinebacke Goering forgot to mention one important thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brainwashing must also function on the homecoming level, where brides and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women and mothers burst into tears but do not accuse the war commander in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chief of having abused their sons but repeat the standardized clichés of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; praising their sons as heroes who have defended American borders some 8000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miles away,
</em><br>
<p>You cannot say that the American people have been brainwashed.
<br>
Of all the nerve.  What if I were to claim that the citizenry
<br>
of your country were the ones brainwashed?  Obviously, you
<br>
have no evidence whatsoever for your extreme claims.
<br>
<p>Moreover, it would even be incorrect to say that Hitler
<br>
brainwashed the Germans.  They read Mein Kampf.  They knew
<br>
what they were getting.  (Yes, it's true that they were not
<br>
aware of the death camps, and it's probably true that Hitler
<br>
could not have gotten away with that in peace time.)  The
<br>
policies that Hitler formulated in the 1930's were enthusiastically
<br>
endorsed by the German people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; put the blame for the deaths of their beloved on Saddam,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accentuate the necessity of unconditional support of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops, pray for them, be proud of America and ... of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course: ask God to bless America, some of them even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking of America as being female.
</em><br>
<p>If that's how the people feel, and you have a problem with
<br>
that, then blame the people, not their so-called &quot;brainwashers&quot;.
<br>
<p>I suspect that any nation that adopts policies not in line
<br>
with those advocated by one Hubert Mania you will deem to
<br>
have arisen through brainwashing, or some other kind of
<br>
unnatural development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the true embarrassing and disgusting climax of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brainwashing. Hermann Goering would have been proud of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving this peak of abusing his folks himself.
</em><br>
<p>Besides, aren't you thinking of Goebbels?  He was the
<br>
minister of propaganda, you know.  Goering was only
<br>
a mass murderer and Luftwaffe general.
<br>
<p>Please explain how a country with total freedom of the
<br>
press, almost total even in wartime, can be so &quot;abused&quot;
<br>
by its leaders as you claim.  If so, then how did Richard
<br>
Nixon ever fall from power?  Why is it that so many U.S.
<br>
government policies become unpopular among the people?
<br>
Or do you only invoke the claim of &quot;brainwashing&quot; selectively,
<br>
when it suits your purposes?
<br>
<p>Lee
