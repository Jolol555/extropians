<p>If you mean animal foods are more expensive then I won't disagree. People
<br>
have a right to save money at the expense of their health, but that is not
<br>
optimizing the diet.
<br>
<p>I notice that time and time again here on the extropian list that I have a
<br>
greater appreciation for the theory of evolution than many others. 
<br>
<p>I believe we are as perfectly adapted to a paleo diet as a giraffe is
<br>
perfectly adapted to eating the leaves from tall trees. In these threads,
<br>
however, few people are willing to grant that 4,000,000 years of hominid
<br>
evolution has optimized the human genome for a prehistoric diet.
<br>
<p>I recall similar objections in the thread about DNA and personality. I was
<br>
arguing that our DNA is integral to our personalities, while many others
<br>
were arguing otherwise. 
<br>
<p>There seems to be a general tendency among extropians to think that natural
<br>
selection is not efficient even over millions of years -- that our genome is
<br>
our enemy in need of being overcome by our powerful intellects, rather than
<br>
our friend in need of being seen as a partner in our development. I see a
<br>
tendency here to distrust nature in favor of the intellect, and yet it was
<br>
nature that gave us that intellect.
<br>
<p>Our intellects have very limited knowledge of proper diet. Many questions
<br>
remain unanswered. Nutritionists themselves cannot agree on proper diet.
<br>
They argue on television and at national health conferences. There is
<br>
however no way to argue with millions of years of evolution.
