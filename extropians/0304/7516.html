<em>&gt; I have faith in the *science* of evolution, yes.
</em><br>
<p>I find the concept of *faith* in *science* disturbing.  Science is
<br>
specifically designed to avoid the need for faith.  Utilizing faith breaks
<br>
the scientific method.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe it is well established that living organisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are best adapted to the environments in which they evolved.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  That is why I have a roof over my head, heat during the winter,
<br>
air-conditioning during the summer, use supplements, see a dentist, and do a
<br>
million other things to improve my status beyond my evolution.  I believe
<br>
this is the basis of being human or transhumanist.  I see no reason to
<br>
prefer a primitive default over modern improvements in any area of my life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you argue with a talking giraffe who told you that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought his long neck was for eating the leaves of tall trees? Would you
</em><br>
ask him if he was a Luddite if he insisted that the
<br>
<em>&gt; leaves of tall trees should be the main staple of his diet?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if he refused to eat the same leaves on the same tree lower down just
<br>
because they weren't high enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nutritional science, organic chemistry and other branches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the life sciences are only beginning to unravel the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full picture of human metabolism.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  Biology and nutrition have the fastest doubling time of current
<br>
extant knowledge than any of the sciences.  This has been the case for
<br>
decades.  Medicine and nutrition is one of the oldest sciences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example it has only been a few years since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutritionists discovered that vitamin C works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best in the company of bioflavonoids and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antioxidants.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  Dr. Jacques Masquelier isolated bioflavonoids as the citrus cofactor
<br>
for vitamin C in the late 1940's and early 1950's, and called it &quot;vitamin
<br>
P.&quot;  Research into the relationship between vitamin C and vitamin P go back
<br>
half a century.  I have old books from the '50s and '60s discussing
<br>
bioflavonoids.  There also were old theories from the '70s about a possible
<br>
&quot;vitamin I&quot; that combined vitamins A and E which helped vitamin C, which
<br>
later developed into an understanding of how antioxidant cofactors help each
<br>
other.  I don't know where you get the idea that these are recent
<br>
discoveries.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, alpha-tocopherol works best in the company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of gamma-tocopherol.
</em><br>
<p>This is not new or surprising either.  Again, there are old books discussing
<br>
the need for various tocopherols in the human diet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The vitamin supplements you buy today vs 30 years ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contain more of the ingredients found in natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paleolithic foods, not less.
</em><br>
<p>Like what?  Corn and wheat and soy derivatives?  Spirulina?  I see no reason
<br>
to think that modern nutrient pills lean more toward a paleo diet than to
<br>
typical nutritional knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Are you really a neo-Luddite in disguise?  I don't mean to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; funny or offensive here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I hardly even know what a Luddite is. :) I'm just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typical guy raised in the San Francisco Bay Area who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens to have spent the last five years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his life studying diet and nutrition and longevity.
</em><br>
<p>But you seem to trust &quot;traditional&quot; knowledge more than scientific
<br>
knowledge.  You seem to discount scientists input on nutrition and think
<br>
nature is better than science.  You also assume that nature is &quot;best&quot;,
<br>
ignoring the repeated complaints that evolution has never favored longevity.
<br>
You argue against modern factory farming, modern food production, modern
<br>
nutritional science, and anything else that conflicts with your traditional
<br>
diet they way it has been for thousands of years.  I can't imagine a more
<br>
Luddite position on diet than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Four millions years of evolution has optimized the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genome for surviving just long enough to reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree. This is why I'm happy to deviate from a natural diet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when there is sufficient evidence to do so. I start with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best of what nature can give me, and build from there.
</em><br>
<p>This seems to be the perfect reason for not wanting to stick to a paleo
<br>
diet.  Since I want to live a long time, and we are naturally evolved to die
<br>
young, I would seek to find as many ways to improve this diet as possible.
<br>
I would leave nothing to default chance without a scientific reason to do
<br>
so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way cholesterol and saturated fats should not be avoided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need some of each for optimal health. As with many things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderation is key.
</em><br>
<p>Any evidence?  Or is this just another unsupported assertion?  The body
<br>
makes its own cholesterol and saturated fat.  Neither is a required nutrient
<br>
that cannot be manufactured.  Neither has been associated with any
<br>
deficiency diseases of not eating enough.  There are essential fatty acids,
<br>
and healthy fats that are required by the body, but cholesterol and
<br>
saturated fats are not among these.
