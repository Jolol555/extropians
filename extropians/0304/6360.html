<p><em>&gt; I believe you're misinterpreting the idea behind the

</em><br>
<p>Not sure how you could say this, Barbara. Paleo diets were what they were. I
<br>
didn't invent them. And tomatoes were not a part of them anywhere on earth. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that a particular plant family
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or genus did or did not exist in Africa or Europe during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time pre-humans and humans were evolving into our present

</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy to eat. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not suggesting that you shouldn't eat your tomatoes. The benefits of
<br>
tomatoes probably outweigh the costs, especially if eaten in the company of
<br>
other antioxidant rich foods which serve to prevent excitoxicity. 
<br>
<p>I am however stating flatly that they were not part of the paleolithic diet.
<br>
Paleo purists should not eat them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another well-known member of the Solanaceae family (also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interestingly, known as the Nightshade family), Atropa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belladonna (deadly nightshade), was apprently around in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abundance when the human species was new, but that certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not mean you'd want to cook up a mess of the fruit for dinner.
</em><br>
<p>Yes of course not. I'm sure our prehistoric ancestors figured that much out
<br>
quite quickly. I imagine that two of the first words ever spoken were
<br>
&quot;edible&quot; and &quot;inedible.&quot;
