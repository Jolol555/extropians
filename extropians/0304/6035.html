aristocrats in Pre WWII Japan.  They weren't a myth.  Their members included 
<br>
generals (possibly admirals, but I must admit that I'm not even sure Japanese 
<br>
military made a distiction), but they were primarily politician.  And they 
<br>
weren't particularlly sub-rosa.  No more than equivalent current groups are.

(One may doubt how important such groups are, but denying that they exist is

unreasonable.)
<br>
<p>Charles,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is short of the full story.  The Black Dragon Society were 
<br>
reasonably close to the way you described them.  However you missed a couple 
<br>
of points.  They were successful in obtaining their goals and eventually seem 
<br>
to have pushed Japan into the misadventures that got them destroyed by the 
<br>
Second World War.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise the Black Dragon Society is a modern group claiming to be 
<br>
the true descendents of the Ninja groupss of yester year.  I understand they 
<br>
are a joke to the martial arts community.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult from the original comments to tell exactly which 
<br>
groups you were referring to.
