<p>Lee Corbin responds:
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that it is the deepest mistake I've been able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify in a decades-long examination of the identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradox to suppose that it's a question of probability.
</em><br>
<p>My opinion on this is uncertain, but at this point I am inclined to
<br>
agree with Lee that the many-worlds analogy is not as strong as it
<br>
might seem.  (In the following, I will use the term &quot;copies&quot; to refer
<br>
to both the original and the duplicate in a duplication scenario, or to
<br>
the versions of yourself which exist in separate many-worlds branches
<br>
after a MW split.)
<br>
<p>Being duplicated, so that there are two of you, A and B, is fundamentally
<br>
different from going through a many-worlds split, which results also
<br>
in two of you, A and B.  The difference is that your total measure
<br>
is twice as much in the duplication scenario as in the MW scenario.
<br>
This is a real, meaningful difference and it may be enough to justify
<br>
different decisions regarding these situations.
<br>
<p>For example, in the MW case, if you can bias the probabilities you
<br>
can shift more of your measure from B to A, decreasing B's measure and
<br>
increasing A's.  But in the duplication scenario that is not possible;
<br>
both of your copies have &quot;full&quot; measure, the same measure as what you
<br>
started with.  You can't increase the measure of either one (although you
<br>
can decrease one or both), while you definitely can do so in the MW case.
<br>
The ability to increase measure of one of A or B is a difference between
<br>
the two scenarios which may justify different actions.
<br>
<p>In the face of duplication technology, evolution may drive us to increase
<br>
the total measure of our copies, just as in the MW example (i.e. the
<br>
real world) it has driven us to act so as to maximize the total measure
<br>
of our copies.  (That last part is just the MW-specific way of saying
<br>
that evolution has taught us to maximize our probability of survival.)
<br>
If that happens, once copying becomes possible, we would strive to keep
<br>
all copies alive, and to make more whenever possible.
<br>
<p>I understand the pragmatic concern that the desire to get from one place
<br>
to another by a teleportation machine would be thwarted for the copy
<br>
that gets left behind.  You have to consider whether there wouldn't be
<br>
something useful that an extra copy of yourself could accomplish.
<br>
<p>But more practically, there will have to be some limits on the creation of
<br>
copies, else everyone could create new ones at a rapid and unstoppable
<br>
pace.  I think we have to assume that these limits, whether legal
<br>
or social or economic, would prevent the routine creation of copies.
<br>
In practice, then, you wouldn't face bizarre situations like teleporting
<br>
from one store to another on a shopping trip and leaving a frustrated
<br>
copy behind at each store.  It wouldn't make sense to create copies in
<br>
this way, for if it were so easy and cheap to create copies, and if it
<br>
were beneficial, you'd just create them all the time.  Therefore I think
<br>
teleporters would normally behave destructively, and copying would be
<br>
done at times and in situations which were specifically intended for
<br>
that purpose.
