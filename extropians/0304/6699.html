<a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Middle%20east%20--%20was%20a%20couple%20of%20other%20things">amara@amara.com</a> quotes: &quot;Brian, today with the Internet we have almost all 
<br>
the media of the world available to us. If we don't speak other languages it 
<br>
means little as English versions are readily available.&quot;  
<br>
<p>and then replies, &quot;You're joking, aren't you?&quot;
<br>
<p>Amara,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not knowingly joking.  Perhaps I was exaggerating but the fact 
<br>
remains there are a sufficient number of foreign language newspapers 
<br>
available in English on the Internet that a person need not remain childishly 
<br>
uninformed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one does not have to construct extensive theories 
<br>
explaining why America is hated in the Arab world when the Arab press is 
<br>
available in English.  A person can readily learn:
<br>
1.  That the press rabble rouses against us massively.  An Arab man in the 
<br>
street has no chance at all of forming an objective opinion of us.
<br>
2.  That by freeing Iraq and removing the sanctions we are going to cost the 
<br>
surrounding countries a trillion dollars, by their estimate, over the next 
<br>
few years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, we do have one means of communication to the Arab masses and it 
<br>
is working.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I walked into my favorite Pakistani grocery store and was greeted by 
<br>
the proprietor a sharp young entrepreneur.  He was watching a video while 
<br>
waiting for a customer.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commented that the movie looked like something out of Hollywood when 
<br>
I was a teenager.  His eyes flashed and he gave me a big grin.  He explained 
<br>
that the movie was a takeoff from Hollywood and said, &quot;America is popular all 
<br>
over the world, it is the best.&quot;  As he said this he was nodding at the 
<br>
screen.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked why?  He explained that the contents of the movie, the song, 
<br>
the dance, the styles and the conduct all represented America and that the 
<br>
middle eastern young adults all wanted America because that was freedom.  In 
<br>
that piece of frivoulous entertainment they saw an entire social contract and 
<br>
they wanted it for themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that where our diplomats and newsmedia cannot effectively 
<br>
represent us our movie industry does.
