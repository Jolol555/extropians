Eliezer S. Yudkowsky:
<br>
<p>I agree with you about burden-of-proof and a priori assumptions, Eliezer.
<br>
There was nothing in your last post that I find objectionable, other than
<br>
your blatant mischaracterization of my position.
<br>
<p>I am arguing *why* the paleodiet should be the default diet hypothesis --
<br>
not that everyone here must assume it merely on faith! See my arguments
<br>
against the dairy farmers in one of my very recent posts, for example, in
<br>
which I cite evidence from modern science that modern humans are not
<br>
well-adapted to dairy. See also my recent message to Harvey, in which I cite
<br>
evidence from modern science that grains and legumes contain lectins, known
<br>
to be allergens and possible causes of diseases.
<br>
<p>Below is another way to view the burden-of-proof question... this requires a
<br>
bit of imagination so please don't attack this argument for that reason
<br>
alone:
<br>
<p>Imagine for a moment that ill-health is the only health problem faced by
<br>
humans, i.e., that death does not happen, but near-death is an unpleasant
<br>
reality to be avoided. You were born 4,000,000 years ago, and since then you
<br>
have evolved in the same way that humans as a species have evolved in actual
<br>
reality. 
<br>
<p>In other words, imagine that your name is Mr. Hugh M. Species. 
<br>
<p>The year is ~12,000 B.C.
<br>
<p>For millions of years you've done fine on a diet of only lean meats, fish,
<br>
fowl, eggs, vegetables, fruits and nuts. This is the diet on which you were
<br>
raised and to which you are genetically adapted. Then, overnight, along come
<br>
the dairy and grain farmers. You awaken one morning to a Neolithic world in
<br>
which people are trying to foist dairy and agricultural products on you. 
<br>
<p>Would it not be unreasonable to ask those dairy and grain farmers to first
<br>
prove their case that these new-fangled foods are good for human health and
<br>
longevity? i.e, would it not be unreasonable to take the position that the
<br>
diet you've followed for millions of years is the default diet hypothesis in
<br>
need of being disproved?
<br>
<p>-gts
