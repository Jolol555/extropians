<p>Freitas has of course done it:

<a href="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Ch03_1.html">http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Ch03_1.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;The human body consists of ~7 x 10^27 atoms arranged in a highly
<br>
aperiodic physical structure&quot;
<br>
<p>If we demand that each atom be located with a precision of 100 pm
<br>
(a bit less than most bond lengths) that means we can locate them
<br>
with integers between 1 and 10^10. That means 3*34 bits to get each
<br>
position (I doubt we need velocities), and 5 bits for atom type. 
<br>
All in all, 7.49e29 bits. This is actually far more than than Egan's 
<br>
exabyte (by a factor of 8.12e10), but I guess that is because there 
<br>
is no packing of the data.
<br>
<p>Atom types are very unevenly distributed (~2/3 hydrogen, ~1/4
<br>
oxygen, ~1/10 carbon, 1% rest), so if we Huffman-code the atoms
<br>
H=0, O=10, C=110, the other = 111... we will gain a lot of bits. 
<br>
Just a simple spatial zip-like algorithm could compress this data
<br>
even better: most oxygen atoms are always found in close relation
<br>
to two hydrogen atoms, and hence the 321 bits of each water
<br>
molecule could be replaced with just a marker of molecule type,
<br>
location and orientation. There are ~5000 molecular types, and
<br>
these can also be Huffman coded. The win, if we assume the average
<br>
molecule to have ten atoms we go from 1070 bits per molecule to 134
<br>
(assuming 256 possible orientations for each Euler angle and on
<br>
average around 8 bits compressed molecule ID), a win of almost 90%. 
<br>
Larger molecules are probably best divided into smaller modules
<br>
like amino acids or functional groups. If we could repeat this kind
<br>
of chunking on larger scales (proteins, DNA, organelles) we could
<br>
probably win a lot more - collagen and actin fibers are eminently
<br>
compressible (IMHO). 
<br>
<p>Still, I think Egan did not think his polis citizens did lug around 
<br>
models of the glycin molecules in each cell in their little toe; 
<br>
most likely they relied on some standardized cell models or even 
<br>
higher level models as described in Permutation City. If we model 
<br>
the bodies with millimeter-precision voxel models we get around 
<br>
a billion voxels, and if each voxel has a megabyte of data we get 
<br>
just 10^12 bytes or 8e-7 exabytes. 
<br>
<p>Assuming a spatial subdivision scale of r, we have (1/r)^3 voxels 
<br>
each with I bytes of info. So the relation for having a exabyte 
<br>
description is 2^60=I/r^3. Using a one micron voxels, each voxel 
<br>
would have to contain about one byte. Maybe that is the basis for 
<br>
Egans guess.
