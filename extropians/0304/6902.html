<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 85'th update of my fly longevity experiments. Average
<br>
temperature was 20.3 C during this run. Since fly longevity is closely
<br>
tied to temperature, I've decided to use this to tie in the longevity
<br>
statistics in my own experiments, with those obtained by professionals
<br>
that publish in peer reviewed science magazines.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own experiments labour under several advantages. First, I use a
<br>
random selection of flies from one breeding bottle to populate any given
<br>
run. The average lifespan measured in my experiments is always going to be
<br>
less than the real average lifespan of the flies I use, as some of them
<br>
are already middle aged, at the start of a run. Second, professional
<br>
experiments are usually conducted under &quot;clean room&quot; conditions, so that
<br>
pathogens such as viruses exert little or no impact on fly longevity. My
<br>
own experiments are compromised by pathogens, so again average longevity
<br>
will be reduced. Third professional experiments use only one sex, and the
<br>
use of mixed sexes will reduce average longevity in experiments such as
<br>
mine.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximal longevity should be less sensitive to experiment conditions,
<br>
but will tend to increase as more flies are used in an experiment. I use
<br>
the Oregon R substrain of drosophila melanogaster, which is known to be
<br>
genetically unstable, so longevity statistics will vary with different
<br>
stocks. Overall I believe that the maximal longevity found in professional
<br>
experiments using large numbers of flies, under carefully controlled
<br>
temperatures, would serve as a useful benchmark for my own experiments.
<br>
(Mechanisms of Ageing and Development 5: 347-370 1976) will serve as my
<br>
benchmark reference source. Here maximal lifespan of Oregon-R flies was 61
<br>
days at 27 C, and 128 days at 21 C. Using a linear extrapolation, maximal
<br>
longevity (MAX) can be expressed as a function of temperature (T in
<br>
centigrade) as follows:
<br>
MAX = 61 days + (128 - 61)*(27 - T)/(27-21) = 363 - 11.2*T days
<br>
For the present experiment with an average temperature of 20.3 C, this
<br>
equation yields a reference maximal longevity of 136 days, which is
<br>
comfortably in excess of the observed maximum of 84 days for this
<br>
experiment. Control longevity at 57 days was very poor. Detailed results
<br>
are listed below.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My previous results indicated that high dose nicotinamide can be very
<br>
toxic. Recently it has been discovered that one of the mechanisms of
<br>
nicotinamide toxicity is SIR2 depletion via nicotinamide competition with
<br>
NAD. Here I check to see if NAD can ameliorate low dose nicotinamide
<br>
toxicity, as well as check out NAD and niacin independantly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present results suggest that both NAD and niacin (a precursor of
<br>
NAD) may be beneficial for old flies. The addition of NAD to nicotinamide
<br>
did increase longevity, but any conclusions regarding the the SIR2 mode of
<br>
nicotinamide toxicity may be premature, since NAD by itself acted to
<br>
increase longevity, and in any case the low dosages of nicotinamide used
<br>
were themselves not toxic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other results, both raw coconut juice, and the yellow dye material
<br>
annatto appear to be helpful. Annatto toxicity is known to be mediated by
<br>
riboflavin depletion, the possibility exists that an annatto/riboflavin
<br>
combination might yield better results. This idea is being tested in run
<br>
#90.
