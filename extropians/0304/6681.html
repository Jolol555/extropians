<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tunnel of Love: Sex in an MRI Scanner
<br>
Antoine Faix, a researcher in Montpellier, France, is one of those who have 
<br>
looked at what happens inside the body during sex. He and his colleagues used 
<br>
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to see how a woman's internal anatomy 
<br>
accommodates a penis in different sexual positions. In 1999, researchers in 
<br>
Holland published the first MRI pictures of couples copulating, but they 
<br>
observed just one position: the man-on-top, or &quot;missionary&quot; position. Faix 
<br>
went a step further. He got images of two couples having sex in the 
<br>
missionary position and in the rear-entry position. 
<br>
<p>He presented his findings in May at the annual meeting of the American 
<br>
Urological Association in Orlando, Florida. 
<br>
<p>&quot;You can really very clearly see that it's different, anatomically speaking, 
<br>
between the missionary and rear-entry position,&quot; Faix says. Indeed, the 
<br>
images are as clear as any illustration in Gray's Anatomy. 
<br>
<p>They show that in the missionary position, the penis -- which looks like a 
<br>
boomerang because much of it is rooted inside a man's body -- butts between 
<br>
the woman's bladder and uterus, lifting the bladder up and forward, and 
<br>
shifting the uterus up and back towards the spine. The Dutch researchers saw 
<br>
the same thing. But in the rear-entry position, the penis pushes on the 
<br>
cervix, causing the uterus to swing down so that it presses on the bladder. 
<br>
This is an entirely new discovery. 
<br>
<p>&quot;My goal now is to do ten, 15, 20 -- to see if it's only in these two 
<br>
couples,&quot; Faix says. &quot;It could be different with other couples.&quot; 
<br>
<p>He also wants to find out if the way organs shift in either sexual position 
<br>
has anything to do with orgasm. &quot;Maybe there are two kinds of vaginal 
<br>
stimulation,&quot; he says. The G-spot, said to be located on the wall of the 
<br>
vagina closest to the bladder, might be stimulated in different ways 
<br>
depending on how the penis bumps things around internally. Nevertheless, 
<br>
scientists still argue about whether the G-spot is a real source of sexual 
<br>
pleasure. Many women claim to have intense orgasms from G-spot stimulation, 
<br>
but some women don't seem to have a G-spot. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It would be great to get female orgasm inside,&quot; Faix says. &quot;It's one of my 
<br>
next goals.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Neither of the women in Faix's study reached orgasm. Both men ejaculated, but 
<br>
only after a long time, and one needed a dose of Viagra to stay erect. &quot;It's 
<br>
really very difficult to have sexual intercourse in this kind of machine,&quot; 
<br>
Faix says. After over an hour in the cramped MRI scanning tunnel, it's no 
<br>
surprise the women didn't reach orgasm. &quot;They were fed up,&quot; Faix says. 
<br>
<p>The Dutch researchers had the same problem with all but one of the couples 
<br>
they studied: a pair of acrobats. All eight women in the study had orgasms, 
<br>
but they described them as &quot;superficial.&quot; The researchers couldn't make out 
<br>
anything resembling a G-spot in any of the MRI pictures.
