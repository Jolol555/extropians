<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cant you at least rejoice in the fact that 20 million people who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; previously living under the horrific oppression of a murderous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyrant are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now (or soon will be) free?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sorry but we keep talking at cross purposes.  You seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miss my point I probably seem to you to miss yours.  I care and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much what our motivations were and are as that is what will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   leat to future actions and is the predictor of them.
</em><br>
<p>We do seem to be encountering some communication issues.  First off, let me
<br>
clarify what I was referring to when I was talking about motivations.  Refer
<br>
back to a previous post by Lee Corbin
<br>
<p><a href="http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::cWpQYksG-fnBh-WUYt-M1Ik-UH9MX1">http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::cWpQYksG-fnBh-WUYt-M1Ik-UH9MX1</a>

<br>
<p>He illustrates a general complaint that those supportive of this effort, and
<br>
other efforts including Vietnam, Korea, etc. often make.  He says of those
<br>
who might support efforts in Ruwands but not in Iraq &quot;Because taking over
<br>
Ruwanda to suppress genocide would not in any way advance the interests of
<br>
the U.S. in the world situation.&quot;  It is this manner I am speaking of.  If
<br>
the motivation of the US's action include *anything* that can be interpreted
<br>
as benefiting the US, then it is heavily criticized, it is *only* purely
<br>
altrustic actions that are every applauded, even if they are miserable
<br>
failures, and especially if they end up making things worse for the US.  I
<br>
find true altruism to be dispicable, deplorable, and anti-extropic (as it
<br>
requires the sacrficing of self for others)  Yet altruism is touted as a
<br>
high moral goal by collectivists and statists.
<br>
<p>It seems that in the case, the fact that it wasnt the primary motivation of
<br>
the US to free the Iraqi people is cited as a reason to not be joyous in
<br>
their freedom.  But since WWII ended, the US has done a lot of things that
<br>
were in its own self interest, (primarily stopping the spread of communism)
<br>
and as a result many nations are now democracies that would have not until
<br>
1989 otherwise.  As MaxPlumm pointed out, not a single country that become
<br>
communist post WWII turned into anything other than communist before the
<br>
fall of the soviet union.  However, many of the countries that we intervened
<br>
in eventually become democracies *way* before 1989.  The fact that making
<br>
these countries democracies was not our primary motivation in no way makes
<br>
our actions immoral, as the fate of the continued existence of the United
<br>
States (and freedom, progress, technological advnace and extropian memes)
<br>
depended on containing communism.
<br>
<p>This is obviously a statement that on many points you might disagree, as you
<br>
have noted your objection to the 'we were containing communism' line, but I
<br>
would be willing to investigate the US actions, incidence by incidence, post
<br>
WWII and then we can determine what choices the US had available to them, if
<br>
indeed they were forced to choose between a thug and a communist despot.  I
<br>
believe the place to start would be greece.
<br>
<p>I also
<br>
<em>&gt; care because I do not believe the utilitarian viewpoint that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things work out reasonably well then what we did along the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was automatically right.
</em><br>
<p>Nor do I, but in this case I obviously disagree with you that what we did to
<br>
get their was wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I brought this up in this circumstance because I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astonished that a few Iraqis dancing in the street seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough for some people to drop questions about what we did and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why and what's next and believe it to be evidence that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously did the Right Thing (tm).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is a piece of the evidence suggesting we did the 'Right Thing' Would
<br>
you consider it evidence suggesting we did the 'Wrong Thing'?  If All Iraqis
<br>
were dancing in the street, would you still not consider it evidence that we
<br>
did the 'Right Thing'  What portion of the Iraqi populace would be required
<br>
to have given their approval of the coalitions actions before,
<br>
hypothetically *you* conceeded that it was the right thing.
<br>
<p>This question, of course, ignores the motivation we had that were self
<br>
interest based, such as preventing the proliferation of WMD to terrorist
<br>
organizations, removing the worlds second largest energy supply out of the
<br>
hands of a murderous tyrant, etc.  Reasons I have gone over before in
<br>
previous posts, which have yet to be addressed on a point to point basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The actions you want to judge instead of motivations?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions were repellent.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree, of course, given the extraordinary restraint to avoid civilian
<br>
causalties.  I believe you were predicting civilian causalties in the
<br>
100,000's range.  In three weeks one of the worst tyrannical governments on
<br>
this planet was removed from power with fewer than 1,000 civilian deaths and
<br>
~100 (?) coalition deaths.  From these figures the actions were ones
<br>
deserving of praise.  Of course, you disagree with the action in the first
<br>
place, so you would find it repellent no matter its manifestation.
<br>
<p>We just invaded a foreign country not
<br>
<em>&gt; at war with us and did so against UN and other international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This point has been addressed at length, the previous Gulf War never ended,
<br>
and Iraq, the losing country and initator of aggression, violated the terms
<br>
of the cease fire, broke UN resolutions, which unaminously called for
<br>
complete disarmement with the threat of serious consequences, and did
<br>
everything it could to delay weapons inspections.  The United States,
<br>
additionally, does not require Internal agreement to defend itself, and the
<br>
UN is a body meant to help nations solve disagreements, it is not a world
<br>
governing body.  And in this particular case it failed to help the nations
<br>
involved solve their disagreement.
<br>
<p>Now, we keep repeating these two lines to one another, and getting nowhere.
<br>
We have a few options presented to us, 1) continue to repeat the same thing
<br>
to one another, getting nowhere 2) stop discussing this and 'agree to
<br>
disagree' 3) attempt to resolve this.  3) has been addressed a lot in the
<br>
past few days with a lot of good suggestions, including sperating values
<br>
from facts, agreeing on established facts, agreeing on deductions, and thus
<br>
agreeing on conclusions.  (as any good debate should) We can attempt this,
<br>
but it would probably require a lot of time and effort, but no doubt in my
<br>
mind both of our opinions will end up being changed in some manner.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is much, much too early to claim the Iraqi people will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free.  The most certainly are not free today.  They are under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign occupation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A foreign occupier that treets them with more freedom and respect than their
<br>
own government, by that definition, they are 'freer' and will continue to be
<br>
more and more so with each passing day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't rejoice over something I do not yet know to be a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.  Sorry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I dont see how you could consider the oppression and torture they
<br>
lived under *not* better than a coalition 'occupation'  considering they
<br>
will not be getting raped, gassed, tongues cut out, etc. etc, it will no
<br>
doubt be better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And yes, I believe a primary motivation was WMD, and the fact that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; despotic west hating racist tyrant hadem and wanted more and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you believe things regardless of evidence.
</em><br>
<p>And of course I could say them same of you.  And we could keep going back
<br>
and forth with these comments, or attempt to resolve the disagreement.  As
<br>
mentioned above, this will also require a significant amount of time and
<br>
effort, I am sure, on both our parts.
<br>
<p>There are a few facts that would be considered and be conceeded or rejected
<br>
upon investigation.
<br>
<p>1)Does (did) Saddam have any WMD?
<br>
&nbsp;1a) Define WMD
<br>
<p>2)Would Saddam use them aginst the US or allies if he could
<br>
<p>3)Is he a murderous west or US hating racist tyrant?
<br>
<p>etc. etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    When you say &quot;We found none&quot; I can only laugh.  As others have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pointed out how silly this statment is, I wont simply repeat them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, they did not point out any such thing.  If you are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be dishonest then this conversation is over.
</em><br>
<p>And I would say you are being dishonest.  But let me re-iterate the
<br>
responses you got to this statment, a statement I found absurd even to be
<br>
coming from someone I am in such utter idealogical disagreement.
<br>
<p>This started out with your statement
<br>
<p>&quot;You have seemed to believe the motive was WMD.  We found none.&quot;
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<p>&quot;Where is the WMD?  Show it to me.  We control the land. Where's the beef?
<br>
Why was it necessary to invade to find any if there was some to be found?
<br>
Are you claiming after all the inspections and all this effort coming up
<br>
empty handed that WMD really was a true reason we went in? The most likely
<br>
explanation for not finding it was that the
<br>
claims that these volumes of WMD existed were bogus to start with.&quot;
<br>
<p>1st, Ron H responded
<br>
&quot;We have had less than a month to search an area that I am told is the size
<br>
of California and all while a war is going on.&quot;
<br>
<p>2nd, Mike Lorrey responded
<br>
&quot;We are finding evidence every day, much of which is reported in the US
<br>
media. The defense department is taking samples and waiting for lab
<br>
confirmations before making any declarations, but finding a warehouse full
<br>
of barrels labeled &quot;Mustard&quot; and &quot;Tabun&quot; is a slight smoking gun. Finding an
<br>
underground lab on the same site that UN inspectors had 'inspected' that has
<br>
weapons grade plutonium in it, and finding a military transport with a
<br>
hermetic room for loading bio/chem payloads into artillery shells is a bit
<br>
of a smoking gun...I suggest you wait for a
<br>
comprehensive report from the DoD.&quot;
<br>
<p>Interjecting, I note that various news reports have indicated that the
<br>
United States and Coalition forces are taking great care in documenting a
<br>
'chain of ownership' or soemthing to that effect, including making sure
<br>
embedded reporters are present when things are found, internation labs test
<br>
anything found, etc. etc, the coalition forces are very aware that everyone
<br>
will suspect them of planting the evidence, as I am sure you are.  However,
<br>
I would note that not more than a week or so ago, the first pretty solid
<br>
evidence was found, ironically, by an NPR correspondent (whos interview I
<br>
heard) detailing the finding or wooden crates full of vials of verious
<br>
chemical and agents in an alleged Al Queda training camp, the very same camp
<br>
that Colin Powell was suggesting as evidence of a link between Saddam and Al
<br>
Queda.  Though I am not familiar with more recent news on this.
<br>
<p>Primarily, the War is not even over yet, its hardly reasonable to start
<br>
running around shouting 'see, they didnt find anything!!!' when most of the
<br>
forces are busy dodging bullets.  I understand your skepticism at finding
<br>
WMD (even if I disagree) but I think that your assistance that they should
<br>
have been found *all ready* is a bit absurd.
<br>
<p>Additionally...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repeat something I said to you a while back on this very same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ready have found WMD, in the 1998 inspections.  Thousands upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; warheads, growth media, delivery systems, etc. etc. etc.  I believe your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; response to that was 'where did you hear that from' to which I (and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe Mike Lorrey) noted it came from Hans Blixs speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I don't think we did find those, certainly not today where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it actually counts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You dont think we did find those?  Let me re-iterate that list again.
<br>
<p>- Iraq has failed to account for 26,500 artillery rockets used for
<br>
delivering nerve gas.
<br>
- Iraq has failed to account for 5,000 artillery shells filled with mustard
<br>
gas.
<br>
- Iraq has failed to account for more than 3,000 tons of chemicals used for
<br>
weapons.
<br>
- Iraq has failed to account for all of its weapons in its recent
<br>
declaration to the United Nations Security Council.  Omissions from the
<br>
declaration include:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;-Iraq did not account for, at a minimum, 216kg of biological agent growth
<br>
media- enough to produce:
<br>
&nbsp;-26,000 liters of anthrax- 3 times the amount declared.
<br>
&nbsp;-1200 liters of botulinum toxin.
<br>
&nbsp;-5500 liters of clostridium perfrigens- 16 times the amount declared.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq has disclosed manufacturing new energetic fuels suited only to a
<br>
class of missile that it does not admit to having.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq failed to respond to UN Special Commission requests for more,
<br>
credible, information about VX (nerve gas) production.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq has never adequately accounted for hundreds, possibly thousands of
<br>
tons of chemical precursors.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq has failed to account for nearly 30,000 empty munitions that could be
<br>
filled with chemical agents.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq provides no information about its mobile biological weapon agent
<br>
facilities.  Instead it calls them &quot;refrigeration vehicles and food testing
<br>
laboratories&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq has upgraded chemical reactors and production equipment at Falluja
<br>
II, one of Baghdad's principal production plants for chemical weapons prior
<br>
to the Gulf War.  Falluja II and other facilities now produce more chlorine
<br>
than is necessary for water treatment- evidence that chlorine is being
<br>
diverted for military purposes.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq has started building a new test stand facility clearly intended to
<br>
test long-range missile engines.
<br>
&nbsp;-Iraq has rebuilt a production facility for long-range solid fuel missiles
<br>
that was dismantled by the UN.
<br>
<p>So when you say &quot;I dont think we found those&quot; are you saying that you dont
<br>
think this list of items was ever found *in the first place* at the
<br>
inspections 10 years ago?
<br>
<p>When this List was referenced, you responded with
<br>
<p>&quot;Where precisely did you get this information?&quot;
<br>
<p>Which I noted at the time seemed to suggest you were ignorant of that
<br>
information at that time, which present doubts in my mind that you had come
<br>
to what (at least I) would consider an 'informed' decision.  Mike Lorrey
<br>
responded to you:
<br>
<p>&quot;Where millions of other informed citizens get it: cable news, the
<br>
newspapers, and the internet. Hans Blix stated these facts before the
<br>
Security Council (as did the US administration) after Iraq released its
<br>
Declaration to the UNSCOM.  There is in fact evidence of concealment in that
<br>
significant quantities of chemical and biotoxins known to be in inventory in
<br>
1998 are not accounted for in Iraq's most recent Declaration to the Security
<br>
Council. They have disappeared from the tally, and Iraq refuses to disclose
<br>
what happened to them. Just because someone hides something very well from
<br>
you does not mean it doesn't exist.  Iraq submitted to U.N. inspections in
<br>
February of 1991, after the Persian Gulf War. In doing so, they agreed to
<br>
end all weapons of mass destruction programs, however; in 1997, American
<br>
members of the U.N. Special Commision (UNSCOM) were expelled from Iraq. In
<br>
1998 Iraq temporarily withdrew cooperation, on grounds of their complaint
<br>
that the Inspection Teams were comprised of an unfair proportion of U.S. and
<br>
British members. In December, 1998, U.N. Special Commision determined that
<br>
Iraq was not fully complying, and removed all inspectors and officials from
<br>
Iraq. Iraq continued to reject new weapon inspections programs. In September
<br>
of 2002, on threat of &quot;dire consequences&quot;, Iraq unconditionally accepted the
<br>
return of U.N. weapons inspectors&quot;
<br>
<p>A few weeks later, I posted all of this to you, again, asking for comment.
<br>
Neither time this information was pointed out did it garner comment from you
<br>
beyond your initial &quot;Where precisely did you get this information?&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, it is clear that these weapons existed.  Where are they now is the
<br>
question?  It is a question that Saddam refused to answer.  Why might he
<br>
refuse to answer that?  Any ideas?  It would be pretty easy for him to show
<br>
they were destroyed if that actually had been destroyed, but that is not
<br>
what he did.  So either you believe that he did destroy them (given your
<br>
insistence that we will find no WMD) since that decleration, or they were
<br>
lost or destroyed at some other time.  Yet the simple fact remains, they
<br>
*were* there, and *now* are unnaccounted for.  Given the consistent behavior
<br>
of his regime, it seems the most likely explanation is that he was hiding
<br>
these from inspectors or international notice.  What do *you* think happened
<br>
to these items?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;  A significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; majority of these weapon systems and delivery systems were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accounted for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in that novel Saddam produced, which meant he still had them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it does not.  Where exactly are they?  Are they right there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we still haven't found them?
</em><br>
<p>Again, its absurd, the war isnt even over yet, and we are only three weeks
<br>
into it.  Give it a little bit of time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I hope from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now on you will cease to say comments alluding to our lack of ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; find WMD, when we all ready found them nearly ten years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are concerned with today.  Is that so bloody difficult for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to understand?
</em><br>
<p>I certainly understand it, but you cant be so concerned with today that you
<br>
forget yesterday existed.  WMD were found, and now they are unaccounted for.
<br>
If they are NOT found now, that could be a pretty scary development, as it
<br>
could mean they were all-ready distributed amongst terrorist organizations.
<br>
Is it so 'bloody difficult' for you to acknowledge reality, the reality that
<br>
the previous inspections found a LOT of WMD, which are now entirely
<br>
unnaccounted for?
<br>
<p>If we found them rather than just hearing
<br>
<em>&gt; they were there ten years ago then we had inspectors there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before we would have taken care of them, yes?  I cannot believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you believe this huge stockpile was there, was proved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusively to be there and we just let them sit on it for 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years.
</em><br>
<p>Hello, he kicked inspectors out.  It took the quick moving and quick
<br>
thinking UN TEN YEARS to actually do something about it, and that was
<br>
passing a resolution threatening serious consequences, 10 YEARS later!!!,
<br>
and then you and they condemn the coalition forces for actually following
<br>
through on UN threats, and, ironically, claiming they are going against the
<br>
UN.  I note this resolution was Unanimous by the security council.
<br>
<p>I can't believe you believe they have it and that they
<br>
<em>&gt; did not use so much as one chemical weapon one time during this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occupation of the country.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that is certainly possible, given the announcement of their only
<br>
ally, france, that they would join the coalition forces if any chemical
<br>
weapons were used.  Some Iraqi soldiers were donning gas masks for some time
<br>
as well, the US lead an intensive information campaign informing Iraqi
<br>
soldiers and commanders that if their unit took part in any chemical weapons
<br>
attacks they would be held accountable for crimes against humanity, they
<br>
also urged unit commanders and leaders to refrain from using such weapons
<br>
and threating them that they know who they are and what units they command.
<br>
But regardless, the fact that none were used does not prove they had none.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attempting to figure out what happened to them now.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why Saddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'cooperation' was completely absurd, he could have simply put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a parking lot and said 'here it is'.  Yet the media kept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parroting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole 'we have yet to find any WMD' line, which as I have tried to make

<em>&gt; &gt; clear, is a gross mis-representation, they should have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying 'We still
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; first place, the war may have been averted entirely.

<p>Certainly none of the statements you have presented.  If, after years of
<br>
searching, nothing is ever found, I may concede that Iraq did not have any
<br>
WMD, but it is possible they could have been funneled to terrorist
<br>
organisations.  Additionaly, stopping hussein before he developed nuclear
<br>
capabilities was of prime importance, as that WMD could kill far more
<br>
people.  Furthermore, the biggest threat is the growing animosity in the
<br>
Middle East against the post-industrialized west, that must be abatted, and
<br>
the best way to do that is creating a wealthy arab democracy in that sea of
<br>
tyranny and oppression.
<br>
<p>Is there any point in which you would concede there was WMD?  What would it
<br>
take for you to do that?
<br>
<p>Ok, now given the time I have put into the post and the fact that we dont
<br>
seem to be getting anywhere, and the fact that neither of us have any say in
<br>
this Iraq issue *anyway* I think we could use our time more valuable by
<br>
picking a particular point of contention, and examing it.  I dont think we
<br>
should do this with Iraq, as, again, the war is all-ready occuring and
<br>
nearly over, and time will prove it just or unjust.  Perhaps examing the
<br>
history of US foriegn policy would be a more valuable effort.
