</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        As I recall Lord Kalvan was in Analog.  How about the sequel?
</em><br>
<p>There was an excerpt published in one of the Baen/Pournelle
<br>
anthologies, I think one of his &quot;There Will Be War&quot; anths. The whole
<br>
book was published, I believe, in 1989, and I am unaware of any
<br>
serialization. The published excerpt I read depicted a Holy War
<br>
launched by Styphon's House against Great King Kalvan, where the
<br>
overwhelming numbers of the combined forces of the other four Great
<br>
Kings defeated Kalvan, though he and his entourage escaped to the wilds
<br>
of the North American plains while his castle exploded as it was taken
<br>
by the enemy. Agents of the Paratime Police, who had been studying the
<br>
accidentally transplanted Kalvan (he was originally a Pennsylvania
<br>
State Policeman in our timeline and a Korean War veteran) and this new
<br>
timeline, were captured by Styphon's House, which obviously is a big
<br>
security problem for the PTP.
<br>
<p>The Lord Kalvan story was originally, it seems, a story from his future
<br>
history, without a Lord Kalvan and with a separate world of human Great
<br>
Kings and Styphon's House (i.e. not a parallel earth), visited by human
<br>
space explorers who introduce democracy and constitutions as they help
<br>
Prince Ptosphes overthrow his enemies. John Campbell thought the idea
<br>
of parallel human evolution so abhorrent that he told Piper to rewrite
<br>
it as a Paratime story.
<br>
<p>I found that all of Piper's Paratime novels were very impressive, as
<br>
was his other future history series that depicted tens of thousands of
<br>
years of human history in space. I believe he was the inspiration for
<br>
Heinlein to eventually merge many of his stories into one contiguous
<br>
history. The one drawback of Piper's writing is that he seemed to hold
<br>
a belief that humankind originated on Mars, migrating to earth as their
<br>
environment became untenable. His Paratime Civilization was based in a
<br>
timeline where Mars never lost its atmosphere and dried up, and there
<br>
are minor comments alluding to such a theory in many different areas of
<br>
his writing.
<br>
<p>He was also, like Heinlein, a swordsman, and had a significant
<br>
collection of firearms and swords when he killed himself. His suicide
<br>
note I have always found to be rather typically dashing Piper, &quot;Sorry
<br>
about the mess, but if I were able to clean it up, I wouldn't have
<br>
left.&quot; He had been left penniless by an ex-wife who apparently married
<br>
him for an expensive Paris honeymoon, and his agent was so disorganized
<br>
that he never got around to sending Piper his royalty checks. By his
<br>
death he was reduced to shooting pigeons from his apartment window for food.
