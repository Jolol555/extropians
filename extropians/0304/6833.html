</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. I have, Harvey. Not only did I ace Stat 101, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also aced all the more advanced statistics courses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including &quot;Quantitative Methods and Research Design,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I took during in a Masters Degree program at Cal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State.

<em>&gt; I would like you show me how anything I wrote in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post was false.
</em><br>
<p>I think you covered the problem with your other post.  Apparently, I was not
<br>
the only one who misunderstood you.  It sounded to me like you were using
<br>
the default hypothesis as a way to avoid providing proof by pushing the
<br>
burden of proof onto those who disagreed with you.  Since you now point out
<br>
that you believe proof has been scientifically determined and that it was
<br>
the scientific studies that endorse your conclusions, I have no disagreement
<br>
with your methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Apparently I haven't made myself clear. I wonder how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many more times I will need to repeat myself on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular point. I've done so at least three times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here already with Harvey and others, in this thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in other diet-related threads populated by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same people.
</em><br>
<p>This is one of the reasons I am currently thinking about ways to &quot;fix&quot;
<br>
e-mail communications.  We often find ourselves repeating points, and having
<br>
points misunderstood by others.  I think it is because e-mail is not
<br>
structures or precise enough to make our points clear.  So jokes without
<br>
smileys are taken as serious.  Comments are taken as full-blown attacks.
<br>
Minor adjustments are taken as complete counter-arguments.  I know this
<br>
happens to everyone on all sides.  And while there is a tendency to blame
<br>
some people for this problems more than others, I think it is a universal
<br>
difficulty with the medium itself.
