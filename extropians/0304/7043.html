On the Rights of Those Not Yet Designed
<br>
Supertots And Frankenkids
<br>
<p>by Erik Baard
<br>
April 23 - 29, 2003
<br>
<p>(illustration: Glynis Sweeny)  
<br>
<p>he complete accounting of the human genome, a de facto guide for
<br>
building a person, met with predictable fanfare last week. Its
<br>
celebration marked 50 years since Francis Crick and James Watson
<br>
published their Nobel Prize-winning description of that iconic spiral
<br>
staircase, the double helix of DNA. 
<br>
<p>&quot;After three billion years of evolution, we have before us the
<br>
instruction set that carries each of us from the one-cell egg through
<br>
adulthood to the grave,&quot; Dr. Robert Waterston, of the International
<br>
Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, told a crowd at the National
<br>
Institutes of Health. 
<br>
<p>With this new knowledge comes new power, the ability to shape our
<br>
fundamental form—and, one day, to better it. Within our lifetime,
<br>
scientists say, we will see the advent of genetically enhanced human
<br>
beings, babies who might look like all the others in the nursery but
<br>
will grow up to jump higher, learn faster, live longer. Powerful and
<br>
privileged, they could also become a vulnerable minority, as much
<br>
subject to prejudice as primed for success. 
<br>
<p>On January 3, during the final, furious effort to sequence those 3.1
<br>
billion units of DNA, a federal court in Lower Manhattan handed down a
<br>
ruling that by some bizarre twist could serve as precedent for a
<br>
third-millennium Dred Scott decision. Judge Judith Barzilay of the U.S.
<br>
Court of International Trade decreed that intelligent characters with
<br>
&quot;extraordinary and unnatural powers,&quot; beings with &quot;tentacles, claws,
<br>
wings, or robotic limbs,&quot; &quot;highly exaggerated muscle tone,&quot; or
<br>
&quot;exaggerated troll-like features,&quot; are &quot;nonhuman creatures.&quot; Really. 
<br>
<p>That ruling, regarding a tax on comic-book toys, revealed a mindset that
<br>
doesn't bode well for the souped-up variants of human who could be
<br>
living shoulder-to-shoulder with your grandkids, or could be your
<br>
grandkids. They could very well be augmented with better genes and
<br>
robotic prosthetics or implanted chips, by choice or necessity. Will
<br>
they face an angry mob of normals when they start filling the roster at
<br>
Harvard? When they go to vote, will they be recognized as citizens? The
<br>
law has gone a lot further in banning their birth than in protecting
<br>
their rights. 
<br>
<p>Months before that court decision, Olympic officials and scientists
<br>
meeting in New York City resolved to bar genetically engineered athletes
<br>
from future competitions. And preferring phrasing that sounds
<br>
protective, the Council of Europe stated as far back as 1982 that &quot;Human
<br>
Rights imply the right to inherit a genetic pattern which has not been
<br>
artificially changed.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Watson, founding director of the National Center for Human Genome
<br>
Research, isn't part of that consensus. &quot;It's strange to say we've come
<br>
to a point where we don't want to improve things,&quot; he told the Voice.
<br>
&quot;It's against the main thrust of civilization's work.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Before we swallow an overweening sense of preciousness about the human
<br>
being, we should be mindful that our Constitution never defined what one
<br>
was. Rather than narrowing our sense of perfection to Leonardo da
<br>
Vinci's precisely proportioned Vitruvian Man, we might define ourselves,
<br>
for ourselves, according to values and qualities like intelligence,
<br>
empathy, compassion—regardless of outward form or inner tinkering. 
<br>
<p>The grand-père terrible of genetic research, Watson argues that &quot;nature
<br>
knows best&quot; is a delusional quagmire. Evolution, after all, is a messy
<br>
set of continual compromises designed to make do for the moment. There's
<br>
the wondrous human hand and the horrible human knee. In his new book,
<br>
DNA: The Secret of Life, Watson advocates genetic modification not just
<br>
to protect us from disease, but to make us smarter, too. 
<br>
<p>Other scientists foresee new, superior offshoots of our species spawned
<br>
by genetic blending with various flora and fauna. Leading lights in
<br>
these fields gathered at Boston University this month to sort it all out
<br>
in a symposium called simply &quot;The Future of Human Nature.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;Enough,&quot; says environmentalist author Bill McKibben in his new book of
<br>
that name, a jeremiad against such supposed technological sins. But
<br>
should SEE BAARD PAGE 36 
<br>
<p>fine-tuned babies and transgenic beings pop up among us anyway, he says,
<br>
&quot;I am certain the better angels of our nature will prevail and we will
<br>
treat them as we would anybody else.&quot; 
<br>
<p>His assessment, that we can hate the sin but love the product of it,
<br>
seems glib given our planet's track record of prejudice. Even children
<br>
of U.S. soldiers and Vietnamese women, so-called Amerasians, faced
<br>
severe discrimination in the land of their birth because the
<br>
circumstances of their conception carried a stigma of colonialism. And
<br>
the organic farming movement has denounced genetically modified
<br>
&quot;Frankenfoods.&quot; How much of a stretch is it to imagine that metaphor
<br>
coming full circle, stigmatizing people enhanced by those same
<br>
technologies? 
<br>
<p><p>The transgenic revolution is already here—fish genes have been spliced
<br>
into tomatoes to make them frost resistant, and jellyfish genes have
<br>
been used to make a fluorescent rabbit. Now imagine if the problem of
<br>
world hunger were eased by creating an even hybrid of human and plant,
<br>
people who could feed off sunshine. We'd all benefit from the reduced
<br>
demand for food, but &quot;would those individuals be protected by the
<br>
Constitution?&quot; asks Lori Andrews, director of the Institute for Science,
<br>
Law, and Technology at the Chicago-Kent College of Law and author of
<br>
Future Perfect: Confronting Decisions About Genetics. 
<br>
<p>&quot;These issues are already on the table. We're going to have to expand
<br>
the definition of man,&quot; she says. The pithiest conclusion to the dilemma
<br>
she cites came from an exchange between her students: &quot;If it walks like
<br>
a man, quacks like a man, and photosynthesizes like a man, then it's a
<br>
man.&quot; 
<br>
<p>It may sound like science fiction, but biotech's progress continues to
<br>
defy prediction. The HIV genome took years to sequence; SARS was done in
<br>
weeks. Human genetic enhancement is drawing closer—we've already
<br>
identified more than a thousand genetic markers for outcomes like Down's
<br>
syndrome. 
<br>
<p>The day is approaching when wealthy parents can pay to have markers
<br>
tweaked or added to bolster qualities like intelligence and athleticism.
<br>
But the rights of such unusual progeny are being curtailed before the
<br>
people even exist. The situation is one the X-Men, conceived as a
<br>
comic-book response to the civil rights movement in 1963 and returning
<br>
to movie theaters on May 2 with a plot centered on a repressive Mutant
<br>
Registration Act, could easily appreciate. &quot;Born with strange powers,
<br>
the mutants known as the X-Men use their awesome abilities to protect a
<br>
world that hates and fears them!&quot; reads their Marvel Comics tagline. In
<br>
the end, the X-Men were sold out by that very company. It was Marvel
<br>
subsidiary Toy Biz that persuaded Judge Barzilay of the heroes' &quot;other
<br>
than human&quot; status so it could reap reimbursements on taxes paid to
<br>
import action figures from China—the levy was higher on dolls, which
<br>
depict humans, than on other toys. 
<br>
<p>That might seem a trivial and unlikely basis for the question of what
<br>
makes us human, but as Andrews notes, &quot;Science looks forward, law looks
<br>
backward. Computer cases rest on what happened with books, and space
<br>
shuttle cases will look back to what was decided for horses and
<br>
buggies.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
--------
<br>
<p><p>The personal decisions that would accompany genetic enhancement are
<br>
frightening. How would you feel about your first child when the second
<br>
one comes bundled with upgrades? Could the younger sibling ever enjoy a
<br>
sense of real achievement, or would the kid forever wonder if that
<br>
three-minute mile had been written in before birth? &quot;I suppose if I were
<br>
the only one enhanced, I'd feel a bit of a cheat,&quot; Watson admits. Where
<br>
do you draw the line between risks and rewards? Changing the germ
<br>
line—those genes that will be passed onto future generations—must be
<br>
done ahead of the fetus's development, and so carries tremendous
<br>
potential for cascades of disaster. Somatic therapies—delivering genes
<br>
to a living person—have loosed cancers in test subjects. 
<br>
<p>Even in best-case scenarios, the questions are endless. Will genetically
<br>
enhanced people be held back by society, just as gifted students are now
<br>
woefully underserved? Should you have to pay insurance premiums inflated
<br>
by others whose parents lacked the foresight to eliminate disease genes?
<br>
How much privacy protection should such people have? Pity the
<br>
presidential candidate who must reveal that she's been enhanced by a lab
<br>
instead of a blue-blood pedigree. 
<br>
<p>Why should the DNA-boosted have to follow our usual strictures at all?
<br>
&quot;The minimum time you must invest to do a Ph.D. these days is something
<br>
like three years,&quot; says Princeton philosopher Peter Singer. &quot;But why
<br>
force someone to do it in three years when it can be done in three
<br>
months?&quot; Need a person with faster reaction times be stuck driving 55
<br>
miles per hour? 
<br>
<p>Social pressure may end up curbing wild-eyed genetic hubris, says
<br>
Princeton molecular biology professor Lee Silver. &quot;Parents want kids
<br>
like themselves, except maybe a little smarter,&quot; he says. &quot;Not beyond
<br>
the curve, but on the leading edge of the curve. I think this is all
<br>
going to happen very slowly, step by step. That's much more insidious,
<br>
of course.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The means to achieve GM babies are spreading, and if the practice ever
<br>
catches on, it'll be because parents are trying to keep up with the
<br>
Joneses. 
<br>
<p>Douglas Osheroff, a Nobelist for physics, opposes genetic enhancement on
<br>
principle. Instead of molecular manipulation, he favors providing a
<br>
stimulating environment, which as a Stanford professor, he could provide
<br>
in spades. But even he concedes, &quot;If it appeared that [my children]
<br>
would not be competitive unless they were engineered, I suppose I would
<br>
seriously consider this process.&quot; 
<br>
<p>So once created, what kind of reception would those kids get? Most
<br>
visions of genetic engineering—Gattaca, Brave New World—focus on the
<br>
danger of having a genetic über-class. These dystopian renderings
<br>
overlook one crucial fact: Time and again, mob rule has eliminated
<br>
elites, real or perceived. &quot;This could be another way privilege is
<br>
concentrated and the underclass will be angry,&quot; Watson says. &quot;The
<br>
underclass has always been angry, sometimes with good reason.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The raw meritocracy of the Olympics will segregate against GM humans,
<br>
even an athlete with a single GM grandparent, according to World
<br>
Anti-Doping Agency president Dick Pound. &quot;They can go and compete with
<br>
people who've had genetic enhancements,&quot; he says. But the Olympics have
<br>
always been a proving ground for genetics. Jesse Owens demolished Nazi
<br>
claims of a superior race in the Berlin games of 1936. And as Silver
<br>
notes, bicyclist Lance Armstrong has a heart 33 percent larger than
<br>
average. &quot;That's not just training,&quot; the biologist says. &quot;That's
<br>
genetics.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Pound freely acknowledges that these people didn't earn their genes any
<br>
more than would a person whose parents had them tweaked in a lab. &quot;No
<br>
matter what you do with a five-one Indonesian or Malaysian, you're never
<br>
going to make him a star NBA player. You're also not going to turn a
<br>
seven-two basketball player into a great badminton player,&quot; he says.
<br>
&quot;Just like athletes from developing nations with poor nutrition, those
<br>
were the cards they were dealt by chance. I don't look to sport to
<br>
resolve all of the inequities of the world.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Those sitting at the highest echelons of intellectual life say they'll
<br>
be more welcoming. Osheroff judged the most recent round of what's
<br>
widely regarded as the junior Nobels, the Intel Science Talent Search.
<br>
&quot;I believe that mental power is far more important than athletic talent
<br>
to humanity, and don't think that we would be likely to exclude
<br>
genetically engineered humans from such competitions as the STS,&quot; he
<br>
says, adding that he'd put his money where his mouth is. &quot;As far as my
<br>
not getting a Nobel Prize because an engineered human won one, I think
<br>
the issue is who has done work which is more deserving. The prizes
<br>
should be considered as drawing attention to major advances in science,
<br>
not something that confers instant genius on the recipients.&quot; 
<br>
<p>But in the shorthand of our culture, getting into Harvard does. &quot;There's
<br>
no dearth of quality, of brain power. Kids with 1600 SATs are a dime a
<br>
dozen now, thanks to prolonged coaching since eighth grade or seventh
<br>
grade,&quot; says Dwight Miller, senior admissions officer at the university.
<br>
The school looks for other intangibles to round out its classes, a
<br>
practice that could thwart a genetic pecking order. &quot;There are plenty of
<br>
arrogant people here already. We don't try to compound it. All of this
<br>
is diametrically opposed to genetic engineering.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Yet Harvard wouldn't limit the number of GM students it accepted. &quot;I
<br>
don't think it's written into the Constitution that one is guaranteed
<br>
the right to attend the college of one's choice. The last thing you're
<br>
ever going to hear Harvard say is there are quotas,&quot; Miller says. 
<br>
<p><p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
--------
<br>
<p><p>The trade-offs and ethical conundrums are enough to tie an anti-quota
<br>
Republican parent like Steve Sanford in knots. He's a successful
<br>
commercial artist and credits genetics for much of his ability, tracing
<br>
his lineage through talented artists and draftsmen directly back to
<br>
George Washington's portrait painter, Charles Willson Peale. His
<br>
daughter, Emily, recently won admission to two prestigious New York City
<br>
institutions, Stuyvesant High School and the LaGuardia High School of
<br>
Music and Art and Performing Arts. But what if she couldn't get into
<br>
Harvard because its ranks were filling with the offspring of parents who
<br>
could afford million-dollar enhancements? 
<br>
<p>&quot;I'd say that's definitely not fair—it's like being able to buy your way
<br>
out of conscription in the Civil War,&quot; her father says. &quot;There could be
<br>
riots, I think. Things could get out of control.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Then again, if he were having a new child in an era when designer babies
<br>
were common, he'd opt for enhancement if he knew it was safe and a
<br>
competitive necessity. But for the same reasons he wouldn't want her to
<br>
have bat wings genetically grafted on, he wouldn't want her to be so
<br>
intelligent as to be &quot;a freak, someone who can't socially relate to
<br>
other people. Being smart has its own rewards, but if you go too far the
<br>
kid will probably be lonely and maybe ostracized.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Sanford intuitively locks onto Lee Silver's powerful brake—that need to
<br>
connect. 
<br>
<p>Society has always been cruel to the unusually gifted. When asked what
<br>
enhancement she'd give a child, Mensa's American president doesn't
<br>
answer intelligence or immunity to cancer. &quot;Sure, I'd want my child to
<br>
have at least an average IQ, but if I had the opportunity to pick one
<br>
thing to enhance for a child I would probably pick physical
<br>
attractiveness,&quot; Jean Becker says. &quot;It opens doors to you. People like
<br>
physically attractive people. It's one thing that has been linked to
<br>
higher wages and an easier emotional life, and I don't know of any
<br>
research like that in terms of intelligence. I'm sorry to say that and
<br>
ashamed that in our culture it's true.&quot; 
<br>
<p>And maybe that'll be the end to which the free market drives biotech:
<br>
the quest for classic beauty under a microscope instead of a knife. Hey,
<br>
at least it would spare a few slots at Harvard.
