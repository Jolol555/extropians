</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, absolutely. My own experience with Atkins:

<em>&gt; I once followed Atkins religiously... -Fred Flintstone 
</em><br>
<p>Reading Greg's experience with dieting and
<br>
fitness gave me an idea regarding evolution via
<br>
mate selection.  I once remarked that humans may
<br>
be able to evolve more quickly than typical large
<br>
mammals because the mechanism of mate selection
<br>
is very powerful in humans.  Do let me expand on
<br>
that thought.
<br>
<p>In evolutionary terms, the human ecological niche
<br>
was constant for a long time.  Then we recently
<br>
we exploded out of Africa, drove the European
<br>
humans to extinction, fanned out over the planet
<br>
and very recently invented agriculture.  In the
<br>
past eyeblink, we suddenly have available to us
<br>
every high-fat food imaginable, in arbitrarily
<br>
large quantities, coupled with a newfound option
<br>
of being physically inactive.  Recall that food
<br>
itself is also evolving, ever selecting the more
<br>
irresistable varieties.  The result is the many
<br>
health problems we see today related to flab.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, one could argue that mate selection is
<br>
working to counteract the fact that we still have
<br>
the ability to store fat, even tho it is no
<br>
longer needed and is actually detrimental.  Slender
<br>
people carry a possible reproductive advantage, for
<br>
they might be preferentially chosen as mates.  Certainly
<br>
one would conclude that from looking at clothing ads.
<br>
<p>Here's the idea.  We have seen animal groups where
<br>
mate selection is dominated by female choice, such
<br>
as most birds, animal groups which selection is
<br>
dominated by male choice such as chimps, animal
<br>
groups in which mate selection is defeated altogether
<br>
by the alpha male keeping a large harem such as
<br>
in elephant seals.
<br>
<p>Insight: human groups have all of these subgroups.
<br>
In the technically advanced western world, mating
<br>
seems to be dominated by female choice (I am open
<br>
to suggestion or counterpoint here).  In what we
<br>
might call more primitive human societies, male
<br>
choice might be the driver.  There remain some human
<br>
societies that have harems and reproduction dominated
<br>
by the powerful and rich.  So unlike most animal
<br>
groups, humans have everything on the scale from
<br>
female selection to male selection and the
<br>
orthogonal scale: the intentional defeating of
<br>
mate selection as an evolutionary driver, all the
<br>
way over to the opposite of that, which is the
<br>
soon-to-come human ability to manipulate genes
<br>
for arbitrary characteristics, which would put
<br>
evolutionary change into high gear.
<br>
<p>In a society in which mate selection is driven
<br>
by female choice, would we not see a different
<br>
set of characteristics emerge than in a society
<br>
in which mate selection is driven by male choice?
<br>
<p>For instance: mammal females love and nurture
<br>
their babies.  For that reason, perhaps adult
<br>
males which maintain some juvenile characteristics
<br>
would enjoy a relatively greater appeal to the
<br>
female population.  This would explain why we
<br>
have the term &quot;boyish good looks.&quot;
<br>
<p>Since human babies have relatively large heads
<br>
with respect to their bodies, perhaps female-
<br>
choice societies would tend to evolve populations
<br>
with bulbous heads.  That is the best way I can
<br>
explain how humans came to have such enormous
<br>
brains, making us far smarter than is optimal
<br>
for mere survival, and far smarter than is optimal
<br>
for maximum reproduction.
<br>
<p>What I really want to do is develop software to
<br>
try to simulate genetic drift as a function of
<br>
mate selection, which I see as a far more important
<br>
driver of human evolution than survival selection.
