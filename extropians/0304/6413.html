OK. I've done a little more homework on the Lewisite thing. I spoke a bit 
<br>
muddily.
<br>
<p>Pace both Ms. Smigorodsky and Mr. Lorrey, I should not have used the word 
<br>
&quot;primitive&quot;--in this forum, it has a predictable dismissive flavor. That 
<br>
was not my intent. If a bloodyminded person could use chipped obsidian as a 
<br>
WMD, it would still be worth taking seriously. A ton of rocks or a ton of 
<br>
chlorine are both troublesome if distributed in a troublesome way. If a 
<br>
simpler substance can be manufactured in bulk more cheaply, any putative 
<br>
&quot;primitiveness&quot; could be a _feature_, not a bug. Lethality per gram is a 
<br>
concern on another axis (the Axis of Lethal, perhaps).
<br>
<p>Lewisite was evidently actually developed fairly late in WWI, too late to 
<br>
be fielded in that conflict.
<br>
<p>Lewisite gains some of its effect from the fact that it contains arsenic. 
<br>
So do some non-Green pesticides, which are still unhealthy for humans but 
<br>
have less of a prompt pain and vesicant effect. A better-safe-than-sorry 
<br>
field test kit might show a positive &quot;lewisite&quot; reading if it just looks 
<br>
for the arsenic. In that sense, Lewisite could be considered &quot;primitive&quot;, 
<br>
though a better word is welcome. Elemental? Elementary? :)
<br>
<p>By contrast, distinguishing high-level (1) Pu-239 (weapons-grade) samples 
<br>
from (2) other (reactor core/dirty bomb) Pu samples from (3) other nuclides 
<br>
seems non-primitive to me.
<br>
<p>Sorry for my contribution to any misunderstanding.
<br>

I am not here to have an argument. I am here as part of a civilization. 
Sometimes I forget.
