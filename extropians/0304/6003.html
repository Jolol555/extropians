</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point, imo, is 'fidelity'.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; Now it can be shown... that, due to the no-cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorem, we can get a *local* quantum transfer or a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *remote* quantum teleportation of one quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state, with a fidelity f &gt; 2/3, just if we destroy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original. It can be shown, also, that without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroying the original, we can realize a *local* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum cloning, or a *remote* quantum faxing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of several copies (from 2 to n), but in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fidelity range of 1/2 &lt; f &lt; 2/3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, due to the linearity of quantum algebra,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and due to Heisenberg's relations, it seems very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to reach, locally or remotely, by deterministic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even by probabilistic means, a perfect xoxing, 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but IMO the point is that perfect fidelity is
<br>
completely unnecessary.  Let us, fancifully, suppose
<br>
that the Atmosphere within the room where I am typing
<br>
this is to be considered an Operator that operates on
<br>
my physical body by bombarding it with many, many more
<br>
than 10^20 atomic strikes per second.  Suppose that
<br>
at the end of 1 microsecond, it transforms me from
<br>
|Lee&gt; to O|Lee&gt;, namely into a person not exactly the
<br>
same as I was before this microsecond bombardment.
<br>
(By the same token, I undergo vast changes internally
<br>
that we might suppose to be unaffected, as a first
<br>
approximation, by outside influences, and so metaphorically
<br>
at least is its own unitary transformation.)  
<br>
<p>The result is that within one microsecond I am transformed
<br>
into a completely different quantum state.  Yet I retain
<br>
my identity, and I do not consider such operations as 
<br>
identity-threatening.  Now quantum mechanics does allow
<br>
in principle that my state might be copied to some remote
<br>
location, but with an even smaller similar loss of fidelity.
<br>
So long as the loss in fidelity is less than I would experience
<br>
in a microsecond anyway, teleportation would create what
<br>
is for all practical purposes a physical duplicate, rife
<br>
with the philosophical consequences of interest.
