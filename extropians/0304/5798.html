<em>&gt; On Fri, 4 Apr 2003, Ramez Naam wrote (among some other things):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My first reaction is a bit skeptical.  Creatures with increased SOD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production don't act like CR creatures.  CR creatures are smaller and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have lower fertility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [many snips]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would strongly suggest *not* going there (in attempting to make sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this at this time).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes the mitochondria produce free radicals -- this appears to be related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the &quot;throughput&quot; of the mitochondrial respiratory chain [when it gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backed up more free radicals get generated] -- but one of the
</em><br>
life-extending
<br>
<em>&gt; mutations in C. elegans involves insufficient Co-Q9 or Co-Q10 (so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitochondrial transport chains get backed up, do suffer reduced transport
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity and perhaps greater free radical generation.  But this may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offset by the reduced ATP generation (effectively CR).  But then in
</em><br>
mammals
<br>
<em>&gt; you have the uncoupling proteins (which serve to facilitate heat
</em><br>
production and
<br>
<em>&gt; would reduce the backup in the mitochondrial transport chains)  (I posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensively about this probably about a year ago).  But they might
</em><br>
generate more free
<br>
<em>&gt; radicals if the free radical production is an inherent part of the
</em><br>
respiratory
<br>
<em>&gt; glucose/oxygen consumption process.  (I.e. more heat == more free
</em><br>
radicals).
<br>
<em>&gt; But then the free radicals could be offset by anti-oxidants such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estrogen or alpha-lipoic acid that may not be present in large quantities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in more primitive organisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one wades into this one is wading into one of the most complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual problems I'm aware of -- and given the state of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge base I personally don't think resolving it isn't going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be pretty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go relax on the beach -- let the grad students that actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to debate these things deal with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### I keep debating the related problem of mitochondrial mutations in PD
<br>
about once a day with my boss and other people, and I can only concur - we
<br>
know little, the system is complex, methods crude. But, we are moving
<br>
forward, step by infinitesimal step. I started recently working with a laser
<br>
capture microscope and we have some ideas about how to nail the mutations,
<br>
which we know simply *must* be there, but haven't been found, despite dozens
<br>
of people working on it.
<br>
<p>Give us a couple million $ and an extra sequencer or two, and we'll get
<br>
them. Guaranteed.
<br>
<p>No beach lounging for me :-)

<br>
<p>BTW, I agree with Mez's skepticism about the article I quoted.
