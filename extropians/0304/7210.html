<a href="mailto:mwiik@messagenet.com?Subject=Re:%20[WAR]:%20not%20about%20WMD">mwiik@messagenet.com</a> writes: To build its case for war with Iraq, the Bush 
<br>
administration argued that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, 
<br>
but some officials now privately acknowledge the White House had another 
<br>
reason for war â€” a global show of American power and democracy.
<br>
<p>Mike,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was entirely predictable that if we won in Iraq that the left wing 
<br>
would fall back regroup and go into its patented strategy perfected over the 
<br>
past 200 years.  Rethink, rephrase &amp;relabel, the shift from the concrete to 
<br>
the abstract.  The opening salvo is to fire so many convoluted salvos that no 
<br>
one will ever be capable of answering them all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just having General Gas Attack of Sadaam's Army threaten to gas us if 
<br>
we entered Iraqi territory was sufficient reason to believe Iraq had the WMDs 
<br>
to back up his threat.  The fact that he had gone to great lengths to evade 
<br>
UN sanctions to have Scud missiles with an illegal range was enough to 
<br>
justify our thinking he didn't intend arming them with water balloons.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice you quoted ABC news.  Mike, I am truly ashamed of you.  Any 
<br>
one of us that listened to ABC news during the war could have collected a 
<br>
pithier Anti-American statement from Peter Jennings than the one you used.  
<br>
For shame.
