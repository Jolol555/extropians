<p>People undergoing mystical experiences nearly always have this kind of
<br>
noesis experience of really knowing How Things Are. The drama may or may
<br>
not be there and there might be a personal God or just Reality present,
<br>
but the sense of Truth is very common. 
<br>
<p>This is actually what bothers me as a materialistic neuroscientist. We
<br>
have brain systems that tell us about the salience, familiarity and
<br>
likely the perceived truth of things. If these were simply made fully
<br>
active we would experience whatever we see or think as totally true and
<br>
beyond doubt (even the dualist explanation that truth is experienced
<br>
directly by the soul doesn't work, since the same argument could go for
<br>
the corresponding truth-detection system within the soul). People with 
<br>
temporal lobe epilepsy sometimes get these sensations. As Dostoevsky 
<br>
described it in _The Idiot_:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was thinking, incidentally, that there was a moment or two in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his epileptic condition almost before the fit itself (if it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occurred in waking hours) when suddenly amid the sadness,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spiritual darkness and depression, his brain seemed to catch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire at brief moments....His sensation of being alive and his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awareness increased tenfold at those moments which flashed by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like lightning.  His mind and heart were flooded by a dazzling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light.  All his agitation, doubts and worries, seemed composed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a twinkling, culminating in a great calm, full of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding...but these moments, these glimmerings were still
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a premonition of that final second (never more than a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second) with which the seizure itself began.  That second was,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of course, unbearable.'
<br>
<p>So if someone makes me experience this sense of total Truth, how am I to 
<br>
know it is real truth or just my hippocampus getting all excited? Even 
<br>
worse, while I can make this argument right now sitting in my office 
<br>
with no divinities around, if one would appear it seems likely that at 
<br>
least while that experience lasted I would be fully convinced regardless 
<br>
of my current doubts. 
<br>
<p>This makes me suspect that I would not (later on) find any divinity 
<br>
appearing in full majesty very convincing. To really be a convincing 
<br>
divinity it would have to convince me without any neurological dramas. 
<br>
<p>Just asking &quot;please grant me a bit of limited omniscience so that I can
<br>
think up a good question and understand the answer&quot; (which I consider to
<br>
be a very neat idea; a bit like the encounter with the eponymous entity
<br>
in Hamilton's _The Naked God_) wouldn't work, since I could always be
<br>
given an experience of having had indescribable experiences (now nearly
<br>
faded) and a very convincing but deep answer I almost but not quite
<br>
could remember.
<br>
<p>Maybe we are going about all this from the wrong direction, trying to
<br>
get a superbeing to demonstrate that it is the supreme super being. It
<br>
is far easier for it to demonstrate that it is merely a super being in
<br>
some practical sense (lift mountains, turn the sea to blood, solve
<br>
diophantine equations instantly). It is probably because we all here
<br>
seem to hail from the monotheistic cultural sphere. What questions would
<br>
you ask Pallas Athene or Thoth if they appeared to you?
<br>
