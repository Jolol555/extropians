<p>How do you know what they did not eat? I hope you aren't thinking they
<br>
didn't have the &quot;technology&quot;... eating grains or legumes requires nothing
<br>
Paleo people couldn't have done (not the dairy, though).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not disagree with this nor does it any way contradict paleodiet theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mesolithic was a short stage between the paleolithic and the neolithic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For millions of years prior, grains and legumes were not significant in the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Short is a relative term. But I see no reason to cut the Mesolithic off in
<br>
this regard - since it was mainly marked by improvement in hunting (bows
<br>
and arrows, dogs). Again, earlier people all the way back could have eaten
<br>
grains and legumes. All the more so where hunting was more difficult and
<br>
less rewarding (as became the case again in the proto-Neolithic Near East,
<br>
this time because of the decline of the megafaunua).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Archeological evidence of human remains show that paleo peoples were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthier than their neolithic progeny. This was discussed previously in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread about diet and evolution. 
</em><br>
<p>What evidence are you looking at? I must have missed all the references
<br>
in the previous part of the thread. Everything I have seen points in the
<br>
exact opposite direction.
