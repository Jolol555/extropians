Damien Sullivan:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Training and habits. This is why people don't want the military 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used for intra-US law enforcement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The military is trained to kill enemies.  That's their job.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The police are (hopefully) trained in apprehension with an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye to civil liberties and due process.  Asking soldiers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to behave with the (hoped for) sensitivity of police is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixing domains and risking the wrong reflexes.
</em><br>
<p>True. And it's a common lament among troops tagged to do just that. We
<br>
might break it down like this:
<br>
<p>1. Law and Order
<br>
2. Peace-keeping
<br>
3. Peace-enforcement
<br>
4. Combat
<br>
<p>Your local police force is suited for number 1. Add some specialized
<br>
units and they can be prepared for any number of localized threats
<br>
involving a handful of miscreants, armed or otherwise. Number 4 is the
<br>
domain of troops trained to sustain a long bloody conflict. But, it's 2
<br>
and 3 that are the problem. Peace-enforcement, in this taxonomy, would
<br>
be policing a population who wants to fight, kill, and otherwise
<br>
pillage, while peace-keeping is a little less hostile; the rivals are at
<br>
peace, but it's tenuous. It's not quite traffic cop duty, but it's not
<br>
quite combat. So, you mention the mixing of domains, but when I look at
<br>
it this way, the domains have to be mixed in some cases. I agree that a
<br>
combat soldier is no more fit for patrolling the suburbs than is a
<br>
suburban cop ready for combat. But these two extremes may not represent
<br>
all or even most of the situations where police are desired for one
<br>
reason or another. In such situations, it seems easier to teach a combat
<br>
soldier to treat a population with respect than to train a cop to
<br>
operate as a functioning member of a combat unit.
