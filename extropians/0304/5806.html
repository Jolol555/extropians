<p>Yes, I think this may be the origin of our disagreement.  Under my current 
<br>
formulation of ethics, I automatically renormalize any number of 
<br>
duplicates or many-world branches such that their total subjective 
<br>
probability from my current standpoint is 100%.  Why should we renormalize 
<br>
probabilities for computationally independent branches of many-worlds, and 
<br>
yet not renormalize them for ordinary duplicates?  After the split, the 
<br>
duplicates will be two independent people who are each worth One Person. 
<br>
But the original Eliezer, who did the splitting, is also only worth One 
<br>
Person - that there are two of him in the future does not change this. 
<br>
Instead, when calculating his One Person's worth, we weight each of 
<br>
Eliezer-A's and Eliezer-B's futures by 50% apiece, or if it's a 
<br>
many-worlds branch, whatever their relative amplitude decrees.  We have to 
<br>
do different calculations to find the value of Eliezer's future, the value 
<br>
of Eliezer-A's future, and the value of Eliezer-B's future.  When people 
<br>
branch you must calculate the future value for *observer-moments* rather 
<br>
than *observers*.  The future value of Eliezer is the renormalized 
<br>
weighted sum of Eliezer-A and Eliezer-B.  On the other hand, the future 
<br>
value of Eliezer-A is the renormalized sum of Eliezer-A's futures.  If I 
<br>
should buy a quantum lottery ticket in a many-worlds universe and win the 
<br>
lottery, I would not thereafter figure that my life had only 
<br>
1/250,000,000th its former value, even though the happy event was only 
<br>
weighted at 1/250,000,000th by my previous self.  I would just renormalize 
<br>
the futures in that branch.
<br>
<p>But that's just a guess.  I really wish I understood what was up with 
<br>
those complex amplitudes.  It seems to say reality is thinking about 
<br>
measure in a different way than I am.  I've tried to adapt, but...
