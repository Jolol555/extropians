<p><em>&gt; [Lee writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's perhaps hard to credit, but a lot of history  was created by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people who acted as a part of something larger than themselves;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who believed that they were a part of a nation, or who believed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they had a people.  I understand that this does not resonate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with some very strong individualists, for whom practically all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communal feeling is alien.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The writer John Taylor Gatto in his book Dumbing Us Down devotes a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time to discussing the differences between traditional communities with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong families and modern communities where the families are weaker and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community is more mobile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I feel very uncomfortable with the content of the book.  Not that Mr. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gatto doesn't present his thoughts convincingly but that I haven't heard any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion of his subject.  That makes me so uncomfortable because I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those differences are extremely important and imminently debatable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        When I was in Grad School I had one of the national experts for my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professor in sociology -- that was forty years ago and his name is long since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forgotten.  He spent some time detailing the characteristics of the northern 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle class family.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        As I recorded all his lectures I took the tape home and shared them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with my wife.  That sparked one of the most intense discussions of our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marriage.  In fact it may have ultimately ended our marriage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You see, we were middle class southerners and that is very different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the middle class northerner.  Because of the considerable inducements 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved we found ourselves becoming northerners and weren't sure at all that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we liked that.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, we have to distinguish the out of sort feelings that people
<br>
from extended family structures might feel as they become less
<br>
extended, and vice versa.  (Though I have to admit that Yankees
<br>
suddenly immersed in southern extended structures are usually
<br>
gratified by the experience---though they might react eventually
<br>
and yearn for more of their previous privacy.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Briefly the northern family is not nearly so much an extended family 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the southern one.  The northern family is also much more mobile.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't not have the support structure of the southern family.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   When I read what you wrote above, &quot; who believed that they were a part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a nation, or who believed that they had a people&quot; I hear the essence of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what Gatto is saying of the stable traditional society.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   When you write, &quot;I understand that this does not resonate with some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very strong individualists, for whom practically all communal feeling is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien&quot; you are simply describing a person without roots.  They are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualists because they have no community or a strong family.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and that is the direction that most people have been headed in
<br>
most developed countries in the past century.  We observed that when
<br>
we moved to southern California from Nebraska in the 1950s that people
<br>
had much less neighborhood life than before.  The Californians were
<br>
much more into fences, and didn't even have porches.
<br>
<p>What is germane to this discussion is which kind of life is more of
<br>
an ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy).  If a nation or a tribe or
<br>
just a group of people is to have a group identity that lasts longer
<br>
than a decade or two, or that outlasts the individual life times of
<br>
its members, then I do not believe that what you call the &quot;northern&quot;
<br>
or I'd call the more modern structures are ESS's.  That is one reason
<br>
why poorer peoples from around the world are demographically replacing
<br>
more &quot;modern&quot; ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Mr. Gatto also maintains that experts devising rules cannot construct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a community that has the closeness of the traditional society.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is well-known.  The record of the social planners from
<br>
Mr. Owen in the early 1800's all the way to Fidel Castro in the 
<br>
2000's is clear.  The most black and white examples are from the
<br>
War on Poverty.  (Poverty, of course, won.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        But let me go a step further.  I think this subject is particularly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate to Extropians.  The central question is shall we have a strong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community that achieves our goals or a weak one that is among the first to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crack when the singularity approaches?
</em><br>
<p>A &quot;strong community&quot;?  Extropians?  You have got to be kidding.
<br>
These are intellectual acquaintances for the most part, with
<br>
maybe a friendship here or there.  Only in fantasies can one
<br>
imagine extropians (or any other kind of anarchist/libertarian)
<br>
really prepared to make severe individual sacrifices for the
<br>
sake of the group.
<br>
<p>Patriotism, on the other hand, is exactly capable of that, and
<br>
that's why patriotism is an ESS for cultures, nations, and 
<br>
peoples.
