<p>I think I've already flamed it once on this list. What I have vivid 
<br>
memories of is that he got Piggy's glasses wrong. The denouement can't work 
<br>
if Piggy is farsighted, and his glasses can't be used to start a fire if 
<br>
he's nearsighted. I caught that, and considered that (as a young teenaged 
<br>
person, in the age group he was supposedly writing about) &quot;phony&quot;, as 
<br>
Holden Caulfeld used to put it--unpardonable in a book that's supposed to 
<br>
be about objective reality. The author got seduced by his wishes, much like 
<br>
his characters. I found that terribly ironic and threw the book across the 
<br>
room as soon as I figured out the story arc (the instant Piggy became 
<br>
useful).
<br>
<p>I'm willing to grunt and admit he had it right about superstition and human 
<br>
nature as he saw it, but that's as far as I'll go.
<br>
<p>You want a chastening view of human nature? ... Thomas Hardy's _Jude the 
<br>
Obscure_.
