<em>&gt; Perhaps one needs to consider that force, call it coercion, exists on a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; meter, but clearly offering bread to a starving man, but insisting that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he do something first counts a some degree of coercion.  And threatening 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a well armed man with a club does, also.  And screaming at a child.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this ranges must include everything up to words of praise for trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform correctly, and down to torturing someone to death for failing to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfy your whims instantly (without your bothering to inform them).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are all acts along a scale of coercion, though I can't place all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them in order.  Somewhere along that scale will be the billboards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is the scale continuous?  (Or essentially continuous to the limit of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human perception?)  Is it reasonable to pick one place along the scale
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, for practical purposes of building efficient legal systems it
<br>
is reasonable to distinguish strongly between physical harm including
<br>
involuntary death, and interactions where these elements are not
<br>
present. Additional distinctions are made, allowing definitions of
<br>
fraud, theft, and other crimes, using practical criteria of usefulness
<br>
in real-life conflict resolution and economic efficiency improvement,
<br>
but they do not invalidate the simple definitions on which successful
<br>
legal systems are based.
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p>, 
<br>
<em>&gt; and say &quot;Everything below this is unethical, everything above it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>### No, there is no simple dichotomy.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------- 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there are other components.  After someone has purchased an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive house with a magnificent view, is it his neighbor's right to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build a high fence?  How high?  This isn't coercion, but it's certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provokation.  So perhaps the model is too simple...
</em><br>
<p>### For the practical purpose of conflict prevention and resolution, the
<br>
idea of private property, with well-defined components adapted to local
<br>
situations, is very useful. 
<br>
<p>Specifically, the bundle of rights contained within a real property
<br>
title, can include clauses describing limitations on the height of
<br>
fences. Since real property is obtained freely, with knowledge of the
<br>
relevant rules, any outcomes in accordance with the law are not
<br>
coercive. Building a fence where not forbidden is not coercive, since
<br>
the neighbor did not purchase a right to forbid its construction. Owning
<br>
a right to forbid a fence is not coercive, since the fence builder
<br>
obtained a property without the right to build fences. As long as the
<br>
formation of the fence building rules (allowed/disallowed) occurs in
<br>
voluntary interactions not involving non-consensual threat of force,
<br>
fraud, or legal/economic monopoly, the system as a whole is
<br>
non-coercive, and will produce either specific outcome (fence/no fence)
<br>
in accordance with the preferences of the citizens. There will be towns
<br>
where fences are allowed, and towns without fences, with citizens freely
<br>
choosing between the two.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simple words and traditional concepts are more suited to understanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things quickly than to understanding them correctly.
</em><br>
<p>### Simple concepts, like self-ownership, reciprocity, free market, are
<br>
almost all we need to build good laws. In part because they define what
<br>
is correct.
