<em>&gt;&gt;Hmmm.  How is this *not* a frightening new chapter in US foreign

<em>&gt; I would say the US has justified the strike by *labeling* it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-emptive, and post 9-11 this was probably inevitable. When your enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is terrorism, you're fighting a method and not a person. But it's merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a trick of argument. This label reduces the amount of hard evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to bring the public on-board. The Bush Administration didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the incontrovertible facts so they said,  &quot;The threat may materialize,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we need to strike now.&quot; In the absence of strong evidence to convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people, pre-emption lets theories make up the difference. If it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frightening chapter of anything, it's a frightening chapter in US public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; militarism. In the weeks leading up to past wars (Desert Storm, Bosnia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kosovo, Somalia) the US public required factual evidence to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military action. Such was provided by the government and the media. Now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post 9-11, the public is willing to accept theoretical evidence (a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story). Post 9-11, can they be blamed? Maybe. But if there's any blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or credit to be had in this war, the Bush Administration gets only small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit of it in my mind. The US public is ultimately responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing the evidence offered. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they certainly can be blamed as the cure is as bad as the 
<br>
dieseae and is likely to lead to worse attacks of the disease. 
<br>
Also, the public settled a little too quickly on what evidence 
<br>
was available (some of it cooked up) in some of these earlier 
<br>
conflicts.  It is an unfortunate tendency of human beings to 
<br>
want to do something, even if it is not really helpful, when 
<br>
seriously agitated.
<br>
<p>I believe the Bush administration deserves much more blame than 
<br>
this as it has used terrorism to justify many invasive changes 
<br>
in the rights and freedom of the people both in practice and on 
<br>
paper.  It has declared perpetual war a la 1984 as a reality.  I 
<br>
agree the people should have screamed loud and long.  But then, 
<br>
how exactly would we have done that?  Millions of us marched. By 
<br>
the polls 60% preferred continued inspections to invasion before 
<br>
we went ahead.   What was it that could have been done that 
<br>
would have been heard and would have stayed the hand of the 
<br>
administration.  I really would very much like to know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Why should nations think twice about WMD when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;having real WMD is the only apparent deterrent to the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;preemptively attacking to prevent it?  Witness North Korea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't deter or prevent someone from getting WMD who already has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. But I understand your point. You're arguing that the case of North
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Korea shows that having WMD will bring the US to the table. Each country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must weigh the benefits and risks. On the one hand, a country may pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a secret WMD program, try to keep it secret, and risk an attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified as pre-emptive. Or they can give up the quest for WMD, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk not having them when needed. Which is the greater risk? The US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopes that by destroying Saddam Hussein and all of his cohort they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven that the risk of the former outweighs the risk of the latter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After all, it was the US claiming Saddam had non-nuclear WMD in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place and that didn't stop them. The current tally seems to be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nukes will deter the US, chemical and biological WMD will not.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I dislike being this cynical but I believe we attacked precisely 
<br>
because we were reasonably sure Iraq did not have substantial 
<br>
WMD.  Claims it did were a ploy to justify attack. Any country 
<br>
that does not have WMD can be targetted in the &quot;war on terror&quot; 
<br>
with impunity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Terrorism ia used to justify coming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;above board with a great number of foreign and domestic dirty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;tricks and increasing their thoroughness.  The threat is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;just to foreign peoples and government but to our own rights and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;freedom.  The government should be losing the faith of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;American people.  I am surprised its reputation does not appear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to he deteriorating more rapidly at home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am reminded of Tim May's 1996 essay _True Nyms and Crypto Anarchy_ in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which he identified his 'Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse' -- terrorism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child pornography, racism, and money laundering. He said these four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are and will continue to be used to justify restrictions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong encryption software, digital cash, anonymity, and data havens. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was clairvoyant beyond his predictions, it seems, as terrorism has now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been used as a part of the logic for war. But, you bring up a curious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissonance. 9-11 paved the way for a power-grab by the executive branch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarians and anarcho-capitalists it seems should be up-in-arms about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, yet many of the most outspoken support the war and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Administration. I think that freedom-loving people should be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous. Pre-emptive thinking is the first step on a slippery slope.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, very much so.
