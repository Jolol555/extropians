I hope Kamen has a success but am doubtful. Glance, if you will, at the May 
<br>
03 Discover Magazine's feature on a company now exploiting the chemistry of 
<br>
thermal depolymerization. It takes energy to convert garbage/waste/filth to 
<br>
energy or chem feedstocks, plastics; but not all that much. 500º and 15 
<br>
minutes seems to do the trick, and that ain't bad. I believe the economics 
<br>
are now comming into better focus (though with all this damn cheap Iraqi oil 
<br>
comming our way, who knows how the finances will turn out?

&lt;&lt;On the contrary, it would have a complementary place at eating
<br>
contests. Imagine that little Japanese guy who ate 50 hotdogs in 5
<br>
minutes. He is gonna need a hard core human waste disposal unit to
<br>
handle his post-contest ejecta.
<br>
<p>On a serious note, I do think it will catch on in any jurisdiction that
<br>
has water supply problems. California, for instance, which is
<br>
confiscating water from as far away as Colorado these days, would
<br>
certainly pass laws mandating use of toilets that use far less water.
<br>
Any island country/state with similar water management issues.
<br>
<p>The technology might also be used in agriculture to treat farm animal
<br>
waste before it reaches the watershed. Agriwaste is the biggest
<br>
pollution problem in the world, currently. It is the cause of the
<br>
pfisteria infestation in the Chesapeake, and is blamed for birth
<br>
defects and health problems with marine mammals around the world&gt;&gt;
