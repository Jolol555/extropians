</em><br>
<p>As some one who has had temporal lobe epilepsy I can confirm this. The
<br>
obvious thought (made many times) is that neurological disturbance of this
<br>
kind is the source of many religious experiences and visions, above all the
<br>
perception that one has been granted powers of prophecy. I vividly recall
<br>
the powerfull feelings of &quot;deja vu&quot; that were associated with grand mal and
<br>
also the way hearing or seeing something would suddenly trigger a
<br>
&quot;recollection&quot; of having &quot;seen&quot; or &quot;heard&quot; this in some kind of previous
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just asking &quot;please grant me a bit of limited omniscience so that I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think up a good question and understand the answer&quot; (which I consider to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a very neat idea; a bit like the encounter with the eponymous entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Hamilton's _The Naked God_) wouldn't work, since I could always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given an experience of having had indescribable experiences (now nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faded) and a very convincing but deep answer I almost but not quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could remember.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't this the way it usually seems to work? Happens with those wonderful
<br>
&quot;trips&quot; psychedelic substances can give you as well.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe we are going about all this from the wrong direction, trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a superbeing to demonstrate that it is the supreme super being. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is far easier for it to demonstrate that it is merely a super being in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some practical sense (lift mountains, turn the sea to blood, solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diophantine equations instantly). It is probably because we all here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to hail from the monotheistic cultural sphere. What questions would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you ask Pallas Athene or Thoth if they appeared to you?
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly right. The whole idea of a supreme being with the qualities
<br>
the three monotheistic faiths give it (omniscience, omnipotence etc)  raises
<br>
all sorts of difficulties whereas the notion of a superbeing with enormous
<br>
but not unlimited powers is much more comprehensible. Polytheism makes more
<br>
sense to me than monotheism. The gods in such religions have great powers
<br>
but are still limited by a basic law or fate and they can't do things that
<br>
are actually impossible. They also have particular abilities (so you'd ask
<br>
Ares for advice about conflict but Athena for natural knowledge). I think
<br>
our monotheistic heritage does affect our thinking in all sorts of ways and
<br>
how we think about very advanced beings (like the one in Hamilton's book) is
<br>
an example of this. Personally the question I want answering is what happens
<br>
to all of those socks that vanish from washing machines and why is it only
<br>
ever one half of of a pair that vanishes?
