Brendan stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Yes, they are.  The Savama are the same organization as the SAVAK,
<br>
who the CIA trained in the 50's and 60's.  The CIA toppled Mossadegh in
<br>
1953 and put the first Shah in power, in spite (and because) of the fact
<br>
that Mossadegh's popular support in Iran was almost ironclad.  When he
<br>
tried to nationalize oil production, we just wouldn't put up with it.
<br>
Homeboy had to go. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>There are other examples of US stupidity, yes indeed. Interference in 
<br>
Guatemala in the 1920's and the Philipines, Chile in the early 70's. But let 
<br>
me use the Wattenburg method: compared to who and compared to when? Are other 
<br>
powers on this planet so benevolent? France, the former Soviet Union, and the 
<br>
current Mother Russia? My understanding is that neither Mossadegh nor 
<br>
Allende's hands were clean of Soviet taint, that is to say; they were 
<br>
popularly elected, but they were players. They waltzed with Ivan and got 
<br>
screwed over by us, or US. That is the problem with being a player in this 
<br>
rough game. The stakes were high during the cold war, and it was no safe bet 
<br>
who would win. We used the tactics of our nemesis, and &quot;won&quot; that way 
<br>
sometimes.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The US doesn't tolerate democracy or stability in strategically critical
<br>
areas of the world.  We prefer to install violent, dictatorial madmen
<br>
who (we believe) we can control, thus keeping our hands nominally free
<br>
of the blood of the populace.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I believe that we like making money and trading with other countries and like 
<br>
stability in strategically critical areas of the world, because we like to 
<br>
make lots of money and travel. Because we liked stability so much, and are 
<br>
lazy, that we ignored the Al Qeida's and ignored the offenses of the Wahabbis 
<br>
&amp; Co. and lost 3000 people in one morning.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;But, as we approach the &quot;Singularity&quot; (still not clear on what that is,
<br>
exactly, or what form people on the list expect it to take), the density
<br>
of information is getting such that people with a clear head can't be
<br>
fooled into thinking that this isn't what's going on anymore.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Singularity, as I understand it, is when technology becomes powerful and 
<br>
complex enough to become self-aware, and have &quot;internal conversations with 
<br>
itself&quot; and become asymptotic in intelligence. Most on this list believe it 
<br>
will approach amazing and overwhelming transcendence, and maybe exterminate 
<br>
people 
<br>
(like in T¹  T²  and now T³) or in an act of magnanimity, help us out with 
<br>
our problems that are part of the &quot;human condition.&quot;  I am not sure if its 
<br>
happening or not, but my take on things is, the future ain't the future 
<br>
unless most of the architecture we dwell in, starts looking like something 
<br>
from 40's and 50's sci-fi mags and comic books.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Welcome to the conclusion of empire...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Sorry Bush ain't no Darth Sidious, and although Chirac looks like Yoda, he 
<br>
acts like Jabba.
