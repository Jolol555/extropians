<p>Brian, I'm a little unsure about your points #1 and #2 since I've
<br>
never seen any supporting literature on the assertions -- but as
<br>
far as #3 goes, I've got a working hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Macrophages are designed to kill bacteria, in particular with with an
<br>
&quot;oxidative burst&quot; (among other things).  This would induce the oxidation
<br>
of the lipids in the surrounding environment, esp. the lipids in the
<br>
bacteria.  So macrophages have a receptor for oxidized LDL's to clean up
<br>
the mess they produce.  But macrophages are also designed to detect and
<br>
migrate into tissues where viruses or bacteria are present (or there are
<br>
other immune system cells detecting the presence molecules that serve as
<br>
indicators for viruses or bacteria).
<br>
<p>I think what happens is that excess oxidized LDL activates the
<br>
macrophage program that says &quot;bacteria are present -- migrate into
<br>
the tissues&quot;, they then get into the arterial walls -- but there
<br>
are no further chemoattractants (bacterial or other immune system
<br>
cell cytokines) that tell them where to go further within the tissue.
<br>
Thus they remain stuck within the arterial walls and end up causing
<br>
the plaques that cause the problems we eventually see in athersclerosis.
<br>
<p>So the two solutions are to decrease total LDLs -- that is what low
<br>
fat diets are all about -- or increase antioxidants to protect the
<br>
LDLs from becoming oxidized (which prevents the macrophages from
<br>
improperly activating &quot;there be bacteria here&quot; program).  I suspect
<br>
the H-G/paleolithic diet had some combination of both of these.
<br>
If one looks at the modern Chimpanzee diet -- it is mostly, if not
<br>
completely fruit/other-vegi-products I believe -- if we evolved from
<br>
that base then we presumably would naturally have higher antioxidant
<br>
levels and lower saturated fat levels in our diet.
<br>
<p>Adapting to more modern levels of less fruit/more meat consumption
<br>
are probably incomplete from an evolutionary standpoint.  Its probably
<br>
only been 3-4 million years.  And the selection pressure on the
<br>
&quot;elderly&quot; has been very poor from a historic perspective.  The aging
<br>
Alpha males probably have a very high mortality rate due to fights/
<br>
accidents with their upcoming replacements.  Pressure to adjust the
<br>
genetic program to prevent heart disease probably doesn't have much
<br>
of a chance.
