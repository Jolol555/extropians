<p>Then you haven't seen the evidence. 
<br>
<p>There is evidence that hominids were eating large game meat as far back as
<br>
*2 million* years ago, though at the time we were scavengers rather than
<br>
hunters. Sites were discovered that suggest early hominids were crushing the
<br>
bones and eating the marrow of beasts killed by other predators. 
<br>
<p>I don't recall offhand the estimated date of the earliest evidence of
<br>
wide-spread hunting but I know it was hardly &quot;recent&quot; in evolutionary terms.
<br>
It is thought that Paleolithic humans in Europe actually hunted many species
<br>
into extinction, which may itself have helped to give rise to the
<br>
agricultural revolution out of sheer necessity.
<br>
<p>If you'll forgive me for saying so, your argument that Paleolithic diets
<br>
were not largely animal-based (which I define as 30% to 50% of calories) is
<br>
outdated. It's the last bastion of vegetarians and their kin who still cling
<br>
to the old argument that we were living in trees and eating oranges and
<br>
bananas until about 50,000 years ago.
