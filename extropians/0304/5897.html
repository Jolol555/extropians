Folks,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read the article Samantha recommended.  I found the following 
<br>
particularly interesting as I had never heard the term neo-con except on this 
<br>
list and by those of so-called liberal persuasion.  The article said, 
<br>
&quot;There's no official membership list, but some names are familiar: President 
<br>
Bush could be called one. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld was one of the first 
<br>
neocons, as was Vice President Dick Cheney. Powell has been at odds with 
<br>
Cheney and Rumsfeld from time to time, so he may not not consider himself 
<br>
one. Others are less well known, but influential nonetheless: Paul Wolfowitz 
<br>
is Rumsfeld's top deputy and, with Perle, has been an early and frequent 
<br>
supporter of war with Iraq; John R. Bolton is Undersecretary of State For 
<br>
Arms Control and International Security; Douglas J. Feith is Undersecretary 
<br>
of Defense For Policy; William Kristol publishes the Weekly Standard, 
<br>
reportedly a must-read in Cheney's office.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to people I regard as conservatives I can't recall ever 
<br>
hearing the term &quot;neo con.&quot;     Have I just missed something or is this a 
<br>
term made up by liberals?  In reading the article I gathered that no one 
<br>
describes themselves as a neo con either.  Is this true?
<br>
