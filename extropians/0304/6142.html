First, I'd like to begin by agreeing with your assessment of Bush's 
<br>
diplomatic abilities.  He doesn't seem to have done a very good job at all 
<br>
of getting international support/approval of this, and I think that many 
<br>
presidents could have done better.  I'm sure that there we will miss scores 
<br>
of opportunities to gain the approval of the Iraqis and help them towards 
<br>
an ideal democracy.  Our mismanagement might result in starvation.  Our 
<br>
soldiers might be prejudiced against Arabs.  Our leader's speeches might 
<br>
slander the efforts that the Iraqis make in bringing themselves towards 
<br>
democracy.  In short, we might do just as bad a job of occupying Iraq as we 
<br>
did of occupying Japan after WWII.
<br>
<p>As you might guess though, this doesn't mean I think that everything will 
<br>
turn out badly.  I don't trust Bush to do a good job either, but I do trust 
<br>
most Iraqis to be sick of wars and dictators, and they are the ones who are 
<br>
really going to have to put their country back together.
<br>
<p>For more information on post-war Japan, I'd recomend reading &quot;Embracing 
<br>
Defeat&quot; by John W. Dower.
