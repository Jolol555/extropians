<em>&gt; This past weekend I was asked the best question I've ever been asked
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanism is not just about technology, of course. But the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a good one even when looked at in broader terms. What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference, if any, between transhumanist thinking and rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking?
</em><br>
<p>My answer would be a bit like yours and Adrian's: it is a question about 
<br>
values rather than how we think rationally about them and the world. 
<br>
Desiring to enhance onself beyond everyday optimality implies a 
<br>
different cost-benefit estimation among our values than among 
<br>
non-transhumanists. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is transhumanism a moral philosophy? That is, does it apply moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles, deduce moral principles, or even recognize moral principles?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it is not a moral philosophy, then what is it? Is it a philosophy at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all? 
</em><br>
<p>Transhumanism as a word unfortunately seems to have a very wague
<br>
meaning, and IMHO it is important to distinguish between the core ideas
<br>
based on a continuation of the humanistic-enlighteniment project and
<br>
other forms. 
<br>
<p>The idea that the human condition can be enhanced is in itself morally
<br>
empty, just a statement and a definition of &quot;enhancement&quot; which may or
<br>
may not be viewed as desirable. Even when seen as desirable, allowed or
<br>
even obligatory there are few constraints on which moral principles this
<br>
can be combined with. This is where different kinds of transhumanism in
<br>
the wide sense diverge, and where I really think we would be better off
<br>
with a more narrow core definition to distinguish the combination of 
<br>
human enhancement and change with humanistic moral ideas of human 
<br>
dignity, reason, freedom etc from other forms. To some extend the 
<br>
transhumanist declaration does this, but it is hard to encompass the 
<br>
full complexity of these streams of thoughts into something short. 
<br>
Extropianism can be seen as a more well-defined subset within this core.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transhumanism and extropianism *do* seem to have a discernible roster of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values. These have evolved considerably since I first started reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about transhumanism in 1996. Or, more precisely, the descriptions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these values have evolved considerably. Of course values such as reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress, improvement, growth, etc., are not themselves unique to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, but in combination they do describe a unique way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about the universe. 
</em><br>
<p>David Friedman pointed out that libertarianism could not easily be 
<br>
compressed into a small set of axioms. Rather, it is a shared set of 
<br>
values and ideas which is more complex to express. I think the same goes 
<br>
for core transhumanism.
