<em>&gt;&gt; Perhaps I am being too pessimistic.  But it is part of the reason I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; opposed the war; the US government may have the sheer military might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to win, but I don't think that Bush has the competence to do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; good with a victory.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; No, I might call you biased and partisan but never pessimistic.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherever you got your viewpoint I admire your willingness to speak out.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, he was right the first time; calling Eliezer partisan is so far
<br>
from reality it's hardly worth rebuttal. It's clearly an artifact of
<br>
/your/ mind that calling the president an idiot somehow implies something
<br>
about his political affiliation when clearly it does nothing of the sort.
<br>
Even the fact that you call it a &quot;viewpoint&quot; speaks to your
<br>
interpretation, not what was said.
<br>
<p>And while I don't share his pessimism, I certainly do agree with his
<br>
concern that the present idiot-in-chief isn't ready to handle success.
<br>
However I believe, and hope, that wiser minds can prevail and turn
<br>
our symbolic victory today into something real and long-term.
<br>
<p>In particular, I'm glad the Brits are there.  They might have a bad
<br>
record as imperialist dogs, but right now that's what Iraq needs:
<br>
someone who is experienced in bringing order to a conquered people.
<br>
Hopefully they are now enlightened enough to then give them their
<br>
independence without the need of a revolution.
