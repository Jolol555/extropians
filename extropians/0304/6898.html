<em>&gt; Just saw the news when I was browsing some anarchist websites.

<em>&gt; Allegedly a fellow named Carllsin was busted by the SEC for insider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trading because he turned $800 into $350 million in a matter of weeks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fellow claims he isn't an insider trader, he is instead a time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traveller from 2250 AD.... offers the location of bin Laden if we let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him go...  Turns out, obviously, that it is an internet hoax. Expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the leftie communuts to continue to believe it four weeks after it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first broke wind. Apparently they don't check their facts even with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a pathetically weak story.
</em><br>
<p>The article was originally from the Weekly World News, the tabloid
<br>
which all the other tabloids are ashamed of.  Actually it's the only
<br>
one I sometimes buy because it's so funny, with the stories having no
<br>
acquaintance whatsoever with the truth.  You can see some examples at
<br>
<a href="http://www.weeklyworldnews.com">http://www.weeklyworldnews.com</a>.
<br>
<p>I can't find the time travelling trader story there now, but it was
<br>
discussed on slashdot where they linked to
<br>
<a href="http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html">http://tv.yahoo.com/news/wwn/20030319/104808600007.html</a>, which
<br>
occasionally reprints some juicy WWN tidbits in their gossip column.
<br>
Apparently the yahoo.com brand was enough to give the story a certain
<br>
amount of credibility, and it got reported as fact here and there.
<br>
<p>I'm amazed that you managed to put political spin on such a stupid story.
<br>
It's a good example of how an entrenched ideology forces you to interpret
<br>
everything through its narrow filter.  Refresh my memory... is Bigfoot
<br>
a Republican or a Democrat?
