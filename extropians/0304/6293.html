<p>I don't understand how you can say that breads and pasta hold up decently!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some veggies hold up even better, but getting

</em><br>
<p>Practically any vegetable is more nutrient-dense than any agricultural
<br>
product. As for getting all your calories from vegetables, I am not
<br>
suggesting a vegetarian diet! On the contrary I consider vegetarian diets to
<br>
be unhealthy (though still more healthy than the typical American diet). One
<br>
can obtain plenty of additional calories from meat, fish, fowl, eggs, fruits
<br>
and nuts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I would say those aborigines are better described as Neolithic rather

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions seem to range from &quot;lots of meat&quot; to &quot;lots of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;grains bad&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The aborigines you mentioned have learned to grind seeds to make flour,
<br>
which puts them on the cusp of Neolithic. Before long they will learn to
<br>
plant those seeds to provide food for the next season, if they haven't
<br>
already learned to do so, and this will put them squarely into the
<br>
Neolithic. 
<br>
<p>I've seen some vegetarian-leaning folks attempt to call their grain-based
<br>
diets &quot;Paleolithic,&quot; and quite frankly I consider them to be either very
<br>
misinformed or dishonest.
<br>
<p>I look to Loren Cordain, Ph.D., as the foremost authority on the subject of
<br>
paleolithic diets. Dr. Cordain is a professor in the Health and Exercise
<br>
Department at Colorado State University. Here for example is an abstract of
<br>
one of his recent research articles:
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT
<br>
<p>Cordain L, Eaton SB, Brand Miller J, Mann N, Hill K.
<br>
The paradoxical nature of hunter-gatherer diets: Meat based, yet
<br>
non-atherogenic.
<br>
Eur J Clin Nutr 2002; 56 (suppl 1):S42-S52.
<br>
<p>Field studies of 20th century hunter-gatherers (HG) showed them to be
<br>
generally free of the signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
<br>
Consequently, the characterization of HG diets may have important
<br>
implications in designing therapeutic diets that reduce the risk for CVD in
<br>
westernized societies. Based upon limited ethnographic data (n = 58 HG
<br>
societies) and a single quantitative dietary study, it has been commonly
<br>
inferred that gathered plant foods provided the dominant energy source in HG
<br>
diets.
<br>
<p>In this review we have analyzed the 13 known quantitative dietary studies of
<br>
HG and demonstrate that animal food actually provided the dominant (65%)
<br>
energy source, while gathered plant foods comprised the remainder (35%).
<br>
This data is consistent with a more recent, comprehensive review of the
<br>
entire ethnographic data (n = 229 HG societies) that showed the mean
<br>
subsistence dependence upon gathered plant foods was 32%, whereas it was 68%
<br>
for animal foods. Other evidence including: isotopic analyses of Paleolithic
<br>
hominid collagen tissue, reductions in hominid gut size, low activity levels
<br>
of certain enzymes, and optimal foraging data all point toward a long
<br>
history of meat based diets in our species. Because increasing meat
<br>
consumption in western diets is frequently associated with increased risk
<br>
for CVD mortality, it is seemingly paradoxical that HG societies, who
<br>
consume the majority of their energy from animal food, have been shown to be
<br>
relatively free of the signs and symptoms of CVD.
<br>
<p>The high reliance upon animal based foods would not have necessarily
<br>
elicited unfavorable blood lipid profiles because of the hypolipidemic
<br>
effects of high dietary protein (19-35% energy) and the relatively low level
<br>
of dietary carbohydrate (22-40% energy). Although fat intake (28-58% energy)
<br>
would have been similar to or higher than that found in western diets, it is
<br>
likely that important qualitative differences in fat intake, including
<br>
relatively high levels of MUFA and PUFA and a lower ù-6/ù-3 fatty acid
<br>
ratio, would have served to inhibit the development of CVD. Other dietary
<br>
characteristics including high intakes of antioxidants, fiber, vitamins and
<br>
phytochemicals along with a low salt intake may have operated
<br>
synergistically with lifestyle characteristics (more exercise, less stress
<br>
and no smoking) to further deter the development of CVD.
