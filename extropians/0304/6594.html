<p>Mez, you are dealing with the fundamental topic of &quot;genotyping&quot;
<br>
and gene &quot;penetrance&quot;.  Someplace I have a very thick file of
<br>
papers on these topics because we dealt with it at Aeiveos Sciences
<br>
Group for the Longevity Genotyping project.
<br>
<p>The short answer is that you aren't going to get a good answer
<br>
(at least to the questions the way you have proposed them).
<br>
<p>There are mathematical formulas that tell you how many individuals
<br>
you would need to genotype to identify the location of a gene
<br>
if you know how much of the &quot;trait&quot; the gene contributes and
<br>
how &quot;penetrant&quot; it is.  For complex traits, e.g. longevity
<br>
(or intelligence) it is likely that the number of genes
<br>
contributing is high and the penetrance may be low -- so
<br>
you need a *lot* of genotypes to get statistical significance.
<br>
That isn't to say it is impossible -- but it is way beyond the
<br>
study scale that one requires to isolate common genetic diseases.
<br>
My gut feeling would be that you need thousands to tens of
<br>
thousands of individuals rather than hundreds (which is what
<br>
will usually suffice for diseases where there are founder
<br>
effects).
<br>
<p>If you want to discuss this more, you may want to email me offlist
<br>
as its a fairly specialized topic.
