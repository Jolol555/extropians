</em><br>
<p>Uh, look at the world.  List some surviving H-G cultures: 
<br>
Kalahari Bushmen: desert.  Australian aborigines: mostly desert.  Mbuti
<br>
pygmies: tropical jungle, feared by the local farmers.  Eskimos: tundra or
<br>
pack ice.
<br>
<p>The North American Indians would be a big exception, but it depends on what we
<br>
mean by surviving: I don't think there's much left now to study.  And a lot of
<br>
the ones in better areas did practice light agriculture.  Estimating the food
<br>
eaten by tribes before 1900 say depends a lot on the accuracy of the observer,
<br>
and trusting them to not have overlooked women's work, or to have been overly
<br>
impressed by male hunting, is more trust than I have.  Again, the ones we can
<br>
actually study now are in desert, jungle, or tundra.
<br>
<p>Do you actually doubt this?  I thought this was an obvious fact of the subject
<br>
-- farmers and herders, whatever their health, had much larger populations
<br>
with which to sweep into any area suitable for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If they seem to eat a lot of meat, it might
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in habitats where plants are scarce. The bottom of the food chain can exist
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, the Eskimos would be an obvious actual example.  A theoretical one might
<br>
be where the plants tend to be inedible, so you have to eat the desert lizards
<br>
instead.  As it happens the aboriginal diet could swing from mostly meat to
<br>
mostly plant, even in the desert, so I'm not going to push this point.
