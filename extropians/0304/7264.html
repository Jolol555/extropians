<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Hal Finney
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sent: Saturday, April 26, 2003 1:10 PM

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought I'd write about my own experiences with the Atkins 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet. I've been on it almost two weeks.  Coincidentally I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; began just a few days after Greg Burch's post about it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although I had decided to try it a few days earlier after a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend told me about his success with the diet.
</em><br>
<p>I should check in, since as of yesterday, I've reached my target weight:
<br>
225 pounds (I'm 6'6&quot; -- 198 cm for the Euros).  Recall that my
<br>
motivation was our upcoming quasi-extropian scuba trip (Max and Natasha
<br>
are joining a large group of my friends and clients in Cozumel) -- we're
<br>
leaving in 4 days, and this morning I tried on my wet suit.  Damn!  I
<br>
look like a balding Batman!  Seriously, I've lost 31 pounds in two
<br>
months.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So what are the results?  Well, there's good news and bad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news.  The good news is that I've lost a lot of weight.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today I was 187, down about 8 pounds in 12 days.  I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of that is water weight; the diet acts as a diuretic and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going through a lot of water.  I lost half the weight in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first three days!  But it still gives you a psychological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lift to see initial results.  And breaking through the 195 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pound barrier I'd been fighting with for so long was a great feeling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bad news is that I haven't felt that good.  After about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two days I started getting headaches and feeling an upset 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stomach, with not much appetite.  This is supposedly because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ketosis is kicking in as the body has used up its store of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carbs and now has to digest fat. The book said this would go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away and I would feel full of energy. Well, the headaches 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have gone away but I don't have that much energy. My workouts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not quite as hard.  Generally I feel somewhat listless, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'm slow to warm up, although once I get going I can work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at pretty much the same level as before.  The one positive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference is that I literally feel light on my feet.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid weight loss is noticeable in the soles of my feet as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walk, they feel the lessened pressure.
</em><br>
<p>My experience was much the same.  The first week to ten days brought on
<br>
some very odd feelings, along with rapid water-weight loss.  (As to the
<br>
latter, be sure to drink LOTS of water!)  Thereafter, the weight loss
<br>
wasn't quite as rapid, and came in waves -- I'd lose a pound or more a
<br>
day, then plateau for 2-3 days, then the weight loss would increase
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>I HAVE experienced an over-all loss of energy and also had the same
<br>
experience of warming up slowly.  In the evenings I have felt very
<br>
&quot;flat,&quot; and think I may well have noticed some lack of mental sharpness
<br>
and quickness, as well -- perhaps due to the lack of glucose in my
<br>
system.  However, all of this was offset, as you've experienced, by
<br>
weighing less.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It's possible that if I increase my carbs somewhat I'll start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to feel more energetic.  Atkins recommends doing a very low 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carb diet, less than 20 grams per day, for the first two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeks, then gradually increasing the carbs and seeing how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your weight loss goes.  My main concern is the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triathlon, but that isn't until August.  I need to be at full 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy by then.  Hopefully I will be able to do that by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing carbs, without falling back into my old eating habits.
</em><br>
<p>Having hit my target weight, my plan is now to return to a much more
<br>
normal diet.  Next week, I'm planning on eating a substantial fraction
<br>
of the tortillas, beans and rice on the island of Cozumel.  This
<br>
shouldn't cause that much weight gain, since diving even in tropical
<br>
waters burns a LOT of calories.  After that, I plan on slowly increasing
<br>
the carbs in my diet until they're up to a level that will provide
<br>
energy but hopefully not pack on the fat the way I did for the last four
<br>
or five years.
