<p>
It took their own papers to prove it, but a writer and historian who is
<br>
transcribing their papers has found that what &quot;Living the Good Life&quot;
<br>
authors Helen and Scott Nearing claimed in their books and what
<br>
actually occured in their real 'good life' are definitely not
<br>
consistent.
<br>
<p>The modern luddite world relies on a 'back to nature' philosophy born
<br>
of the folk, beatnik, and hippie movements. This philosophy of romantic
<br>
acadianism and mysticism found inspiration in the work of the Nearings,
<br>
first published in 1954, who claimed that you could abandon modern city
<br>
life and 'get back to nature'. They claimed you could because they
<br>
claimed that they had actually done it.
<br>
<p>Their book, &quot;Living the Good Life: How to Live Simply and Sanely in a
<br>
Troubled World&quot;, claimed to detail their life of 20 years in Winhall,
<br>
Vermont on an unclaimed farm. They first moved there in 1932 from new
<br>
York City. She in her 20's, he in his 40's, they built a complex of
<br>
stone buildings there and claimed to be living a life of frugal
<br>
subsistence and organic gardening. They made money from maple sugaring,
<br>
and broke their days into four hour chunks of 'bread work', personal
<br>
time and social/community activism.
<br>
<p>Historian Greg Joly says it wasn't quite that way. &quot;The way they
<br>
presented it in 'Living the Good Life' is different from how they lived
<br>
it,&quot; he says, &quot;They had a lot more help than they give credit to.&quot;
<br>
<p>While they weren't the only 'back to the landers' of the era, their
<br>
book, the first of many they wrote, stood out because it provided
<br>
detailed instructions for the average city slicker to leave city life
<br>
behind and strike out into the wilderness, forging a new life of
<br>
frugality. &quot;They described a very pragmatic, step-by-step process, as
<br>
opposed to purely a narrative story,&quot; Joly says.
<br>
<p>As he studied the Nearings, though, the boyhood image he had formed of
<br>
them, developed over a life of trying to replicate his own &quot;Good Life&quot;,
<br>
jarred with what he found. Their portrayal of an ascetic life was
<br>
supplemented by family money on both sides, which they failed to detail
<br>
or even mention in their books.
<br>
<p>Helen Nearing's papers, for example, show that the couple spent three
<br>
to four months a year for a decade at their small cold water flat in
<br>
New York City, something that wasn't mentioned in their early writings.
<br>
Helen also bought a brand new truck every year with family money. &quot;I
<br>
heard that from some of the natives up here, I thought it was just sour
<br>
grapes, but Helen's diary lists the new trucks.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Nearings also gave the impression that they made a living growing
<br>
blueberries after they moved from Vermont to Maine in 1952 to start
<br>
another homestead. It turns out that Scott Nearing's gardening notebook
<br>
shows that they only made money off blueberries for one year.
<br>
<p>Joly and his wife live in Jamaica, Vermont, in an off-grid homestead of
<br>
20 acres. They heat their home with wood and grow much of their food.
<br>
They still find that his wife must work a full time job as a teacher in
<br>
order to make ends meet. &quot;It just isn't possible to homestead with the
<br>
template the Nearings presented, because they never addressed the issue
<br>
of income,&quot; Joly explains.
<br>
<p>For those wondering at this authors own knowledge, I grew up here in
<br>
the Upper Valley of the Connecticutt River, between Vermont and New
<br>
Hampshire. I've worked on farms, milked cows, pruned orchards,
<br>
collected maple sap, and tended vegetable gardens. My father started a
<br>
&quot;Victory Garden&quot; in the early 1970's partly for economics and partly
<br>
because of the Cold War. We kids were responsible for weeding,
<br>
maintaining, and harvesting a garden covering about 1/4 to 1/3 acre.
<br>
Mom and dad canned that which was not consumed by the end of harvest.
<br>
So much so that we still had jars of beets and pickles in the basement
<br>
for many years later (not that we'd want to eat them by that point). To
<br>
this day, I still have zero interest in even having decorative plants
<br>
in my residence...
<br>
<p>As we saw in last year's PBS series &quot;Frontier House&quot;, living the
<br>
luddite life has it's drawbacks and limitations. It also has a tendency
<br>
to be 'nasty, brutish, and short', in ways that are quite often glossed
<br>
over and overlooked by those who hate technology so...
