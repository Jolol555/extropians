<em>&gt;   Are you going to attempt to say that the cost of living in say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1970 dollars has not risen and risen dramatically in the last 32 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years?
</em><br>
<p>The issue is not the cost of living by itself, but the cost of living
<br>
compared to income.  Both have increased due to inflation.
<br>
<p>The way to get an objective measure is to use constant dollars.
<br>
These are dollars adjusted by the consumer price index, which reflects
<br>
price changes in a typical package of consumer expenditures.  The CPI
<br>
takes into consideration increases in costs of food and housing, as well
<br>
as clothing and the other things that people spend money on.
<br>
<p>So what your question boils down to is, has per-capita personal income,
<br>
measured in constant dollars, increased since 1970?  Luckily, the answer
<br>
is easy to find.  Looking at the Statistical Abstract of the United
<br>
States, at <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/01statab/income.pdf">http://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/01statab/income.pdf</a>,
<br>
table 647 shows per capita income in both current (i.e. the currency of
<br>
the time) and constant dollars.
<br>
<p>In then-current dollars, per capita income rose from $4,101 to $30,069
<br>
from 1970 to 2000.  Applying the inflation factor vs constant 1996 dollars
<br>
(not shown in the table but it can be calculated from other columns as
<br>
3.44 for 1970 and 0.94 for 2000) gives a constant-dollar per capita
<br>
income increase from $14,114 in 1970 to $28,121 in 2000.  Per capita
<br>
income has roughly doubled during the time period when inflation is
<br>
taken into consideration.
<br>
<p>In other words, the cost of living for a typical family is about half
<br>
as much today, relative to their income, as it was in 1970, just the
<br>
opposite of what you claimed.
<br>
