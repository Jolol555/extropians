<p>
I remember reading a science fiction novel which depicted a sort of
<br>
structured debate similar to what Harvey and Anders are describing.
<br>
I think it may have been Earthweb or David's Sling.  It was written
<br>
by one of the Drexleristas anyway.
<br>
<p>There was some kind of auditorium, I think with live debaters, and people
<br>
could add comments in text which would appear on screens, they could
<br>
fact-check each other and revise their opinions.  Highly rated questions
<br>
would get highlighted and float to the top of the screens where they
<br>
would be posed to the experts arguing the two sides, all in real time.
<br>
I think it was supposed to be a depiction of the idea of a Science Court.
<br>
<p>Does anyone remember how it worked?  Is it something we could experiment
<br>
with online?  I think our recent terrible failure to achieve anything
<br>
more than name-calling in political debate here demands a new approach.
<br>
