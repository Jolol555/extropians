<p>If 80% of other governments behave as Hussein's government did, we've
<br>
got a lot of campaigns to plan out. Putins statement was obvious
<br>
hyperbole (especially considering how short Russia is falling these
<br>
days under Putin, particularly in press freedoms).
<br>
<p>As I've stated before, there are nations around the world who have
<br>
ambitions for greater dominion/influence that they recognise will come
<br>
into conflict with the US some time this century. China is one example.
<br>
What many of these countries are doing now is an 'oh shit' realization
<br>
that the US mainstream is finally catching on that international
<br>
politics isn't some &quot;Kumbaya&quot; campside love-in. The UN is specifically
<br>
NOT used by most governments to expand freedom and improve human
<br>
rights, but to limit, obfuscate, and hinder such things.
<br>
<p>For example, Saddam's government actually had a Human Rights Ministry.
<br>
I am not joking. If you think that it's job was to improve the human
<br>
rights of Iraqis, you are smoking something. Another example is Libya
<br>
sitting on the UN Human Rights Commission. An absolute joke and a
<br>
farce.
<br>
<p>The hostility of many governments to the US is because they resent our
<br>
degree of influence, and especially worry that they are going to be
<br>
next on the list.
<br>
<p>I shall note that a poll this week of which countries Americans think
<br>
are our biggest enemies, there was Syria, North Korea, and in third
<br>
place, France. The funny thing about this is that I am absolutely
<br>
certain that those Frenchmen who heard of this result are uniformly
<br>
offended that they were not number one.... ;)
