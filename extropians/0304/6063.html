<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not like they've vastly different from us in that respect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People are dying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in North Korea, and we do close to nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Besides billions in aide, I guess thats close to nothing.  In any case, the
<br>
US tried to do something about 1 murderous dictator and was criticized by
<br>
the appeasing liberal world for doing something about said government which
<br>
it could be argued posed a credible threat to US civilians.  North Korea
<br>
doesnt really pose a threat to the US in the same manner Hussein did, but I
<br>
wish we rolled right in thier and disposed *that* murderous dictator as
<br>
well,  given the horrific conditions in North Korea which I have repeatedly
<br>
posted.  Of course, the US would just be called colonialist, imperialist,
<br>
arrogant, etc.
<br>
<p>People are dying
<br>
<em>&gt; throughout the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third World due to lack of food, water, hygiene, or medicine, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much.
</em><br>
<p>Again, when we try to oust the murderous oppresive governments that *cause*
<br>
the vast majority of these issues, we get nothing but criticism.
<br>
<p>Actually many European countries give higher percentages
<br>
<em>&gt; of their GDP
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as foreign aid than we do, and most of that won't be military aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like ours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, so possibly over the decades they've done more to save human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life than we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.
</em><br>
<p>I guess you cant count the millions of lives that were saved by preventing
<br>
the spread of murderous communism.  Preventing the change of South Korea to
<br>
communism alone surely saved millions of laves from starvation and execution
<br>
as enemies of the state, and surely saved the entire south korean populace
<br>
from enslavement.
<br>
<p>And arguably any rich country which let Third World
<br>
<em>&gt; products in without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tariffs would do even more for those countries; that wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the EU, though it might be Australia or New Zealand.
</em><br>
<p>On that I agree, depending of course if said third world country actually
<br>
allowed its own people to acquire wealth and own property, which many do
<br>
not, instead of lining the pockets of despotic rulers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And some say much of Iraq's suffering in the past decades is due to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sanctions.  I don't know what to think myself.  &quot;It's not us, it's Saddam!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The UN hasn't banned these things!&quot;  &quot;No, it just puts indefinite holds on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, which amounts to the same thing.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Those are UN sanctions, and were imposed after the incident and Halabja was
<br>
brought to light by the Iranian govermnent.  I should note that the kurdish
<br>
controlled north saw none of the problems that Saddam's controlled southern
<br>
parts saw, including the attrocious infant mortality rates, and the North
<br>
was under the same sanctions as the south.  Additionally, no one has the
<br>
*right* to be a dictator, not even Saddam, and as such he is morally
<br>
culpable to anything that happens to his people in response to his shitty
<br>
dictatorial actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; in the U.S./U.K. actions in Iraq.  I think it is a combination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of fear of WMD falling into the hands of terrorists and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what happens if we invaded another country on the grounds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WMDs and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't find any?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, *if* the French or the Germans or the Russians, *really*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believed in minimizing bloodshed we would have seen them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pressing for the removal of Saddam through some peaceful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nasty though his regime is, just what are the numbers associated with it?
</em><br>
<p>Conservative estimates, as mentioned before, suggest 200,000 deaths at the
<br>
hands of Saddam's Regime, not counting military deaths.  North Korea, by
<br>
comparison, sees some 1 to 2 million deaths from starvation every year,
<br>
while its field and factories remain empty, it recieves billions in
<br>
international aide, and maintains a standard army of 1 million, with
<br>
artillery cannons perpetually aimed at Seoul.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just what is the total amount of bloodshed, and how does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compare against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things in the world?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Considering you seem to be criticizing this attempt to do something about
<br>
'things in the world' I dont see how pointing out how little we have done to
<br>
stop other 'things in the world' can be used as an implied reason not to do
<br>
something about this particular attrocity.  Thats sort of like 'Why bother
<br>
arresting this mugger, you arent aresting all of them'
