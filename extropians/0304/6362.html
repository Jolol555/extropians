<em>&gt; When will you learn that I stopped considering your opinion
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; grade plutonium were reported in anything I saw.  I suspect if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something like this was found it would be front page news.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think they were found then give us the urls to see them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oruselves.   Otherwise take it elsewhere.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there were a lot of these report on CNN and elsewhere.  The only
<br>
problem is that the follow-up tests always showed that they were not
<br>
chemical weapons or plutonium.  People who believe there are weapons of mass
<br>
destruction tend to remember all these findings.  People who don't believe
<br>
there are weapons of mass destruction tend to remember all the negative
<br>
tests.  In the end, both sides remember clearly reports that supported their
<br>
side.  Either way, it is too early to tell, and preliminary tests aren't
<br>
accurate anyway.  The real answer will come weeks or months down the road.
<br>
We either will find a smoking gun, or there will be no smoking gun.
<br>
<p>(Or as usual in these conspiracy theories, we will have missiles that go
<br>
slightly over their range allowance, or precursor chemicals that might be
<br>
used to make something else, or witnesses that think they saw something
<br>
which is long gone, etc....  And everybody will think the evidence supports
<br>
their side.)
