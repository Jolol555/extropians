<p>Devon -- I'm not sure whether you are speaking about an actual
<br>
reference here or &quot;methods&quot; -- could you please qualify?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i think that one of the most important things any child can learn

</em><br>
<p>I think Devon is right on the mark here.  One can't drive a car
<br>
until one learns what the steering wheel, brake pedal and accelerator
<br>
pedal do.  So too one would presume with the brain.
<br>
<p>So introducing them to a working theory of the brain as early
<br>
as possible seems like a good idea.  I would cite William Calvin's
<br>
work (<a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/">http://www.williamcalvin.com/</a>) as a really good place to
<br>
start unless something better comes along to displace his ideas.
<br>
Dawkins and E.O. Wilson might also be good uplifting foundation
<br>
materials.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As well, it would do well for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in applied behavioral technologies; NLP, Somatics, bio-electricity, etc . .
</em><br>
<p>I might be a little more careful here.
<br>
<p>I've read the books on NLP and view it as quite interesting but I
<br>
would like to see some scientific studies that &quot;prove&quot; it.  With
<br>
respect to somatics, I have little knowledge though I may have
<br>
encountered it in some modified forms before, but it also seems
<br>
to need some more verification.  I'm not sure what is meant by
<br>
&quot;bio-electricity&quot; but one has to be careful -- while neurons
<br>
certainly work on electrical principles such terms can easily
<br>
push undiscriminating people over into the realm of crystals,
<br>
angels, hobbits and leprechauns.
