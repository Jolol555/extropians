<p><em>&gt; Aw come on Spike. Let's treat the topic with a bit more nuance than that,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's so puzzling? If we're really undergoing a &lt; coff &gt; spike of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; startling proportions in temperature, whether anthropogenic or solar or
</em><br>
due
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; go haywire. Hotter here, colder there, but overall more turbulent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customary patterns thrown into chaos outside their historic stochastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ranges. If you're a wee animal, too bad--this is the state of nature. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're a human with Vastly expensive, delicate infrastructure in place,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ranging from coastal ports and cities to enormous established
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agricultural/pastoral/transport systems, you might be shit out of luck.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this could be abstractly beneficial, in the way that having legacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrial plant bombed out of existence can give the next generation a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quick leg up. But people don't usually welcome the kinds of droughts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; floods that are currently afflicting Australia, for example, no matter how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bracing for their character and how much it unsettles the encrusted order

<p>In other words, it's not warming so much as abrupt (relatively) change that
<br>
people don't like. The &quot;news&quot; in the original piece isn't news to historians
<br>
(and BTW the data is about as robust as historical evidence ever gets,
<br>
despite what some scientists would have you believe). What the record shows
<br>
is that climate change is good news for some, bad for others. So the
<br>
Medieval Climate Optimum was pretty good if you were a viking but disastrous
<br>
for Dutchmen as it led to the huge flood in the 12th century that drowned
<br>
two thirds of the low countries and created the Zuyder Zee (much of which is
<br>
still there). Not a lot anyone can do to prevent this though. Florida real
<br>
estate doesn't look like a good bet to me if you look back just 80 years to
<br>
the weather it experienced in the 1920s when it had a series of huge
<br>
hurricanes. Not so many condos and hotels back then.
