In a message dated 4/1/2003 1:00:13 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:natasha@natasha.cc?Subject=Re:%20A%20Weight-Training%20Question">natasha@natasha.cc</a> writes:  If the body you want is lean and cut, then your 
<br>
diet will have a major influence on your goal setting.  If it is to bulk up, 
<br>
or lean down there are alternatives.  So, I'd have to know what your goal is 
<br>
and help you achieve it vis-a-vis diet and anaerobic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ideal body I want is flexible and useful.  I was an amateur boxer 
<br>
and a distance runner of average height.  The last time I got into fighting 
<br>
weight, I was a lean, lean, lean 147 Lbs.  To give you some perspective on 
<br>
that in boxing that is a Welterweight.  The welterweight class is always a 
<br>
very busy class because the average guy that gets himself in really great 
<br>
shape comes in at about that weight class -- or perhaps at middle weight.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today at 68 years old I would not wish to be that light -- I get too 
<br>
ornery to even like myself.  &lt;VBG&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years I have lifted weights and beefed up a little.  But, 
<br>
but the most fun available has been Tai Chi.  Of all the ways of competing 
<br>
one on one it is the best.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, men and women can also spar equally in Tai Chi.  I know this is 
<br>
so because a gal in my age group that was not a top Tai Chi fighter cleaned 
<br>
my everloving plow.  She was above my class but not one of the really good 
<br>
ones.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I was not able to find time for class for very long.  
<br>
Tai Chi requires too much space to do comfortably at home so that is a non 
<br>
starter.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However China has another internal art called Pa Kua.  It is perfect 
<br>
in that it requires only about six feet of floor space that still leaves some 
<br>
extra room to swing the arms.  Pa Kua also provides tremendous opportunities 
<br>
for improving flexibility.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any comments, questions or snide remarks will be welcome.  &lt;G&gt;
<br>
