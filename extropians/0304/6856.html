No, there seems to be no other like Al Stewart. I think the reason that he 
<br>
had limited success in the 70's was the was music was pidgeon-holed back 
<br>
then, for easier marketing and promotion. A mix of folk (which was dead), 
<br>
pop, and 70's light rock. Kind of a melodic Dylan. Warren Zevon came in the 
<br>
same realm as Al Stewart, and was similarly limited. Curiously, I find 
<br>
Dylan's 70's and 80's lyrics and tunes (which nobody listens to) much better 
<br>
then the popular stuff he did in the 60's. It seems pretty easy to change the 
<br>
lyrics to Dylan and Al Stewarts songs, to an Extropian bent. This is like the 
<br>
&quot;filk-singing&quot; of so many science fiction fans.

<p>Spike noted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Al Stewart!  Spud, hes one of my all time faves.
<br>
I have all of his discs, even the ones that didn't
<br>
sell.  Love em all.  The lyrics are so deep and
<br>
intricate, the melodies eloquent.  The man was
<br>
a *stellar* example of the innovative music that
<br>
came outta the 70s alternative rock scene.  Is
<br>
there another like Al Stewart?
<br>
<p>Very curious that only two of his songs ever made
<br>
it high up on the pop charts, Year of the Cat and
<br>
Time Passages, both faaaar from his best work.
