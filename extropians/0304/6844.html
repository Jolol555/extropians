<em>&gt; Here is a brief explanation of the difference between animal proteins and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; veggie proteins.  Animal proteins are &quot;complete&quot; proteins in that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructed of aminos preformed into the exact ratios required to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flesh.  Therefore it is perfect for human consumption and direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utilization.  However, veggie proteins are &quot;incomplete&quot; proteins.  They do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not contain all the amino acids in animal flesh, but contain subsets of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;essential&quot; aminos.  The &quot;essential&quot; aminos are those that cannot be created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the body, but must be eaten.  Vegetarians then have to create other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;non-essential&quot; aminos out of the &quot;essential&quot; ones.  Then, vegetarians have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to assemble the aminos to create new proteins to be utilized in the body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the big difference between vegetarian protein sources and animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein sources.
</em><br>
<p>My understanding is that most proteins are broken down essentially all the
<br>
way into their constituent amino acids during the digestion process.  One
<br>
page I found that describes this process (not very authoritative though)
<br>
is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6100/1tamasAAproteins.html">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/6100/1tamasAAproteins.html</a>.
<br>
A few amino acids may still be bound together in pairs (dipeptides)
<br>
or triples (tripeptides) but most are broken down to singles.
<br>
<p>These amino acids circulate in the blood, and they are used to build
<br>
proteins in the cells which need them.  Some proteins do circulate in
<br>
the blood but I think these are mostly used for signalling and such.
<br>
Generally, proteins are built by cells at the point where they are used.
<br>
<p>Based on this, I wouldn't expect much difference between eating animal
<br>
or vegetable protein in terms of whether or where proteins are reused
<br>
or torn down.
