Robert Bradbury:
<br>
<em>&gt;Does anyone else on the list like Fiona Apple?
</em><br>
<p>She's great. Her first album was recorded when she was young (17?
<br>
19?). I was amazed by that because her music has the kind of 'soul'
<br>
(lyrics, emotion) that I've heard only from those musicians who have
<br>
had large life-altering emotional experiences. (Perhaps she did,
<br>
only earlier than the rest of us.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have really strange musical tastes -- I changed out the CDs in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer from Fleetwood Mac to Fiona Apple today. And have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;known to &quot;appreciate&quot; everything from Three Dog Night to the Blues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brothers to Russian pop music.
</em><br>
<p>I bought some more Bratsch when I was in France last week... (my favorite
<br>
band for the last few years)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.bratsch.com">http://www.bratsch.com</a>
<br>
<p>And another of my favorites: Happy Rhodes is touring ...
<br>
<p>Auntie Social Music
<br>
<a href="http://www.auntiesocialmusic.com">http://www.auntiesocialmusic.com</a>
<br>
<p>... in an unusual way.. From an email I received recently:
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
&quot;Dear Listener of Happy Rhodes music,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm writing to you to let you know that Happy is planning a tour in
<br>
support of her upcoming CD. A large part of this tour will be in the form of
<br>
House Concerts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who might not know, a house concert is a show that is given in
<br>
an individual's home. Folks who want to host a house concert, book it with
<br>
the performer and provide a cleared and preferably large room, where people
<br>
can comfortably watch a private performance from their favorite artists.
<br>
Usually, 100% of the proceeds go to the artist, assuming there are no
<br>
expenses for the homeowner.&quot;
<br>
---------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So I'm probably just strange.
</em><br>
<p>We could have an eclectic music tastes contest. I have not met
<br>
someone who has as strange (OK, eclectic) as me ...
