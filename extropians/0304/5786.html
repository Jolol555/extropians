<p><em>&gt; I would like some help with a model in which minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws would have a positive effect on the wealth of, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, then the lowest wage earners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I posit N entrepreneurs in country X where there exist M &gt;&gt; N
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (that is, M much greater than N) low-level workers.  In order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to become wealthy, an entrepreneur must enlist the aid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers in his enterprise.  Only entrepreneurs and workers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now it seems to me that if the numbers N and M are fixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e., no worker may become an entrepreneur) and M is larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the number of workers H that the entrepreneurs can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly use, then a minimum wage causes H people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receive more money than the H workers would receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise, supposing also that at least M-H workers receive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing in every case.
</em><br>
<p>I think the issue in this kind of analysis is how the number of employed
<br>
low-level workers, which you don't have a letter for but I will call E,
<br>
varies with the minimum wage.  Generally, with a higher minimum wage there
<br>
will be fewer workers employed, but the details of that generalization
<br>
will depend very much on the specifics of the case.
<br>
<p>With a low or no minimum wage, E would be at its maximum, which
<br>
corresponds to what I think you mean by H, &quot;the number of workers H that
<br>
the entrepreneurs can possibly use&quot;.
<br>
<p>With a higher minimum wage, there would probably be fewer people employed,
<br>
for several reasons: there may be some substitutability between people and
<br>
technology, so if people get more expensive, some work tasks will shift
<br>
to technology; expenses to produce products will be higher, so there
<br>
will tend to be fewer products consumed and so fewer people employed;
<br>
and some tasks just can't be done economically above a certain price,
<br>
so those jobs will be eliminated if the minimum wage is above that price.
<br>
<p>However, the degree of decrease in E as the minimum wage rises will
<br>
depend very much on the particulars.  In some cases, the factors above
<br>
may not be very significant.  There may not be technology to replace
<br>
the workers, and the product produced may have a high demand even if
<br>
its price increases, so there could still be high employment of workers
<br>
even with a high minimum wage.  In that case the minimum wage increase
<br>
would shift a higher portion of total income into the workers' pockets.
<br>
In other cases, increasing the minimum wage will end up hurting the low
<br>
paid workers by reducing employment.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how significant a factor it is whether workers can become
<br>
entrepreneurs.  I suppose that if the minimum wage is a net positive
<br>
to workers, then they would be less likely to take the risk of trying
<br>
to become entrepreneurs, while a minimum wage that hurts them would
<br>
encourage them to take the leap.
