</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>My casual rephrasing of William R. Clark's abstract to the effect that
<br>
antagonistic pleiotropy might not actually exist caused Ramez to leap to
<br>
the defence of the concept.
<br>
<p>Clark's full text is at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/downloads/evolution.html">http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/downloads/evolution.html</a>
<br>
<p>Clark was not denying the effect exists - as Ramez said the effect has
<br>
been noted many times.
<br>
<p>As Robert Bradbury said
<br>
<em>&gt; The typical concept of &quot;antagonistic pleiotropy&quot; is that something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is designed to help out early on but ultimately ends up being harmful.
</em><br>
<p>What I think Clark is saying is that the senescence genes are built-in
<br>
from the start.
<br>
<p>Selected Quotes -------
<br>
<p>The problem for evolution was how could aging have evolved when most 
<br>
animals die of accidental causes well before senescence begins to be 
<br>
expressed. How could a trait not expressed by the majority of members of 
<br>
a species be acted on by natural selection, and come to be fixed in the 
<br>
species as a whole?
<br>
<p>There are difficulties with that portion of the theory implying that 
<br>
senescence effector genes gradually accrued in different species over 
<br>
evolutionary time, in a random process not directed toward aging per se. 
<br>
The problem is that the senescence-related genes described so far do not 
<br>
behave that way at all. Recent genetic analyses have shown that the 
<br>
fundamental mechanisms of senescence, and the genes underlying them, are 
<br>
remarkably similar in virtually every eukaryotic organism studied, which 
<br>
is hardly consistent with a random, independent accumulation of 
<br>
late-acting harmful mutations over the evolutionary history of eukaryotes.
<br>
<p>End Quote ----
<br>
<p>That is why he is saying that &quot;antagonistic pleiotropy&quot; is not real. Not 
<br>
that the effect doesn't happen, because it does, but because the 
<br>
cause is built in to all species DNA.
