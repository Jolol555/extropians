<em>&gt; Harvey as gts tried to point out to you, historical evidence clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows some dramatic negative health changes
</em><br>
<p>I don't dispute this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; all while much of the first world population has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faithfully eaten what nutritional scientists claim is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safest diet - &quot;the food pyramid&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I was under the impression that &quot;the food pyramid&quot; was a USDA advertising
<br>
campaign to promote agriculture products, much in the same way that the
<br>
&quot;four food groups&quot; were intended to promote dairy and meat products.  I
<br>
don't know of any serious nutritional researcher who subscribes to the FDA,
<br>
RDA, USDA, or other government propaganda on these issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, I can understand the feeling of wanting to do your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research and come up with what you think is an even better way to eat than
</em><br>
the now
<br>
<em>&gt; almost-discredited food pyramid, but how can you be any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure that your ideas will turn out any better?  It seems like you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially going to experiment on yourself,
</em><br>
<p>No way.  My &quot;own research&quot; is into pre-existing scientific literature,
<br>
specifically experimental abstracts in biochemical libraries.  I am trying
<br>
to figure out what has been scientifically proven, not what popular culture
<br>
thinks nutritional science says.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can still supplement it with substances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seem to be well-proven to help extend lifespan.
</em><br>
<p>This is what I call a scientific approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; P.S. Can anyone show me some real proof that vegetarians live longer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some evidence mentioned at URL below says they don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/myths_truths/myths_truths_vegetarianism.html">http://www.westonaprice.org/myths_truths/myths_truths_vegetarianism.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>I hope you don't think that I would agree with any of these myths.  These
<br>
are all based on pseudo-science and religious teachings.  No nutritional
<br>
scientist would believe in any of this garbage.  What you seem to think of
<br>
as &quot;nutritional science&quot; is pop-culture arm-chair science and pseudoscience.
<br>
It has nothing to do with real science and scientists.  I have even crusaded
<br>
against some of these myths myself.  There are ZERO plant sources for
<br>
vitamin B12.  Vitamin A1 and beta-carotene are two different nutrients.
