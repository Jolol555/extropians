From: gts [mailto:<a href="mailto:gts_2000@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20evolution%20and%20diet%20(was:%20FITNESS:%20Diet%20and%20Exercise)">gts_2000@yahoo.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; It's extremely likely that hominids have been eating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fermented fruits for millions of years. Also organisms in our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gut are producing alcohol constantly. 
</em><br>
<p>Can you provide references for the two statements above?  I haven't
<br>
heard either of them before and would like to learn more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact we've evolved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an enzyme for the specific purpose of metabolizing alcohol 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (called alcohol dehydrogenase, if memory serves). The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence suggests very strongly that the human genome expects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modest amounts of alcohol.
</em><br>
<p>The liver enzymes involved in metabolizing alcohol also metabolize a
<br>
number of other compounds.  For example, they're important in the
<br>
metabolic clearing of GHB (which is part of the reason why combining
<br>
GHB and alcohol is dangerous).
<br>
<p>For that reason, I'd be cautious about over-interpreting the presence
<br>
of these enzymes as evidence for co-evolution of humans and alcohol
<br>
consumption.  That might be why the enzyme is there, or there might be
<br>
some other reason(s).
<br>
<p>Very interesting theory on prehistoric alcohol use though.  The
<br>
consensus among anthropologists is that every human culture yet
<br>
studied has used chemical or ritual means to intentionally explore
<br>
mental states (e.g., &quot;get high&quot;), so if there was some easy way for
<br>
our hunter-gatherer ancestors to extract alcohol from the environment,
<br>
it wouldn't be too surprising for them to find and make use of it.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
