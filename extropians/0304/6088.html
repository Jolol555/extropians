<p>### This is a fascinating thread in which I can't participate as much as
<br>
I want because of time constraints, but let me make one observation:
<br>
<p>Trusted computing could work even without a threat of force behind it
<br>
(in the sense of forbidding the use of non-trusted systems). There are
<br>
huge databases of content, which are too complex and fragile to exist in
<br>
a reliable and cheap manner on P2P networks. An example is the sum of
<br>
all biomedical literature available on Medline, including the full-text
<br>
articles. Trusted access points to this database would simplify selling
<br>
it to users outside of universities. Now, a person with an access point,
<br>
a camera pointed at the computer screen and a robot to type commands
<br>
could circumvent any DRM restrictions, and copy parts of the database
<br>
into non-trusted systems, but he could not provide on-demand access to
<br>
the full database (which is crucial to the scientist) without either
<br>
copying everything (impossible/expensive), or maintaining the trusted
<br>
access anyway. In this case, the owner of the database would have an
<br>
economic advantage over the bootleggers, and as long as the price of
<br>
trusted access is not unreasonably high, the market for bootleggers
<br>
would be quite limited. Trusted computing would enhance this economic
<br>
advantage.
<br>
<p>It would be very important in this case to maintain the &quot;fair use&quot;
<br>
provisions of current law and to extend them to P2P networks. They would
<br>
act as a check on the power of the database owner - if he decides to
<br>
increase prices too high, P2P networks could undercut him, but as long
<br>
as he remains price/hassle competitive (=the total burden of price +
<br>
inconvenience for his product is lower than for the P2P access), he
<br>
would stay in business. This would be a win to all sides, with built-in
<br>
non-governmental means of staying balanced. The copyright law would only
<br>
proscribe *commercial* abuse of protected data, giving enough of a
<br>
stimulus to produce it, but without the unrestricted monopoly that would
<br>
exist without P2P networks.
