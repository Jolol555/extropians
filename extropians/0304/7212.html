</em><br>
<p>I'm not arguing for the war in Iraq but be fair...
<br>
<p>It's not killing folks to show democracy is better.  It's removing
<br>
an oppressive dictatorship to give democracy a chance.  Killing
<br>
people is an sad side effect.
<br>
<p>In theory the show of force is a message to people who think in terms of
<br>
force.  A cynic could view it as a message from Washington to do what
<br>
we say or else.  But one could also view it as making an example of a
<br>
criminal to tell other criminals to clean up there acts or else.  I think
<br>
other
<br>
methods would have worked better but bottom line either Saddam
<br>
Hussein's regime had it coming or it did not.
<br>
<p>It does trouble me that governments (people) so seldom give their own
<br>
reasons for things.  Politicians tend to sell you on the features you want
<br>
to hear.  I can believe that Washington was concerned about WMD
<br>
and aggression from Iraq but not seriously concerned.  Liberating the
<br>
Iraqi people was an easier sell after the fact because so far the costs have
<br>
not been high to Americans.  That Washington mostly wanted to see a
<br>
democracy in Iraqi as an Arab example of a better system does not
<br>
bother me.  That oil and strategic concerns are a big part of the equation
<br>
does not bother me.  All in all either the war was predictably likely to be
<br>
a net win for the US, the world, and the Iraqi people or it was not.
<br>
<p>How much better if Washington had said:  Saddam is a son of a bitch
<br>
let's go take him out of power as a message to all of the other bastards
<br>
in the world.  It will be good for the Iraqi people.  Our businessmen
<br>
can make a profit.  Our soldiers can play with their toys.  The world will
<br>
be better off without him in power.  It may help the whole Middle East
<br>
situation.  Hell, it might even give Americans a moral boost.  Any
<br>
objections?
<br>
<p>As a libertarian I think the war would have been better funded by
<br>
voluntary contribution.  I think governments initiate force way to often
<br>
and are wasteful of resources.  Leaving that aside was it a good thing
<br>
for some group to remove Saddam Hussein and his government from
<br>
power?  Would the Iraqi people approve?  Will they be better off?
<br>
Is it something the US could afford?  Were there obviously better
<br>
things to work on?  I'm not so sure I was for the war but I'm not
<br>
sure it was a bad thing either.  Time will tell.
