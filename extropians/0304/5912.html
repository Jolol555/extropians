<p>I was going to make an ad hominem here, comparing Samantha's grip on
<br>
reality to that of Baghdad Bob. I think, instead, that her attitude
<br>
here reflects a common difference in attitude.
<br>
<p>I get generally categorized with conservatives, despite my many
<br>
libertarian opinions, but I think that this labelling occurs because I
<br>
share a neocon attitude about my opponents. 
<br>
<p>Liberals and left wingers, and their sympathizers, generally have an
<br>
attitude that their enemies and opponents cannot possibly have
<br>
benevolent intentions because they are inherently evil, wrong, and
<br>
stupid. They beleive that because libertarians like myself and neocons
<br>
tend toward beleiving in the value of self interest, that that is ALL
<br>
we value, that we cannot possibly have any fiber of altruism in our
<br>
beings, they cannot consider the idea that self sacrifice can serve
<br>
self interest.
<br>
<p>Conversely, libertarians like myself and many neocons have an attitude
<br>
about liberals and other left wingers like Samantha that they certainly
<br>
do have benevolent intentions, but that the policies they espouse to
<br>
achieve them are inherently evil, wrong, and stupid, SPECIFICALLY
<br>
because they reject the value of self interest as a goal of self
<br>
sacrifice.
