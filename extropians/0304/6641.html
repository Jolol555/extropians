<p>
I am currently studying nutrition.  I hoped it would be a quick review so
<br>
<p>that I could get onto more interesting things.  But the many claims and
<br>
<p>counter claims make me think it will take a while.  My current problem
<br>
<p>then is devising a nutritional study program.  I'm not out to do original
<br>
<p>research at this time.  My goal is to learn enough to make practical
<br>
<p>diet recommendations for myself and others in line with what is known
<br>
<p>by current scientific wisdom.  And then to keep up with nutritional
<br>
<p>science as it progresses.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I'll sketch out some ideas here and I hope some people will throw
<br>
<p>out some other ideas for me to consider.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I figure start with the most popular nutritional textbooks.  Popular books
<br>
<p>written by the most established nutritional experts working at the most
<br>
<p>established nutritional institutions also sound good.  If someone I think
<br>
<p>well grounded or who has a lot of nutritional training suggests other texts
<br>
<p>read those also.  Once familiar with the textbooks look at web sites,
<br>
<p>journals, etc.  Once I have a good sense of nutritional science look at
<br>
<p>nutritional theories and ideas from other established scientists.  After
<br>
<p>that have a look at popular books, journal articles, and just about
<br>
<p>anything someone who seems sensible suggests.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Once I read a bunch of stuff and thoroughly confuse myself I want to
<br>
<p>start over and compile a list of claims and arguments.  Some claims
<br>
<p>will be well supported (and usually I will have to go to good peer
<br>
<p>reviewed journals to see that they are actually well supported.  I can 
<br>
<p>also rely on reputation and chains of reputation once I establish
<br>
<p>someone's reputation with me).  The well supported claims will determine
<br>
<p>the parameters of my diet.  Other claims can compete with taste, 
<br>
<p>convince, etc. to fill out the rest of my diet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Ideas on how to learn nutrition, things to read, ideas, etc. would be
<br>
<p>appreciated.  Usually people do not add much to my posts but ideas
<br>
<p>are great seeds for other ideas so if you have any thoughts please feel
<br>
<p>free to share them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I only want to spend so long on nutrition.  I see nutrition, exercise, 
<br>
<p>mood and medical testing as the biggest sub-categories of health.  
<br>
<p>Nutrition is also important for caloric restriction which looks like 
<br>
<p>one of the most promising currently available anti-aging methods.  
<br>
<p>Aging, diseases, organized violence, poverty and some restrictions 
<br>
<p>on freedom, seem like the main risks to staying alive.  I am also 
<br>
<p>interested in productivity and capability enhancement  (collaboration, 
<br>
<p>wealth, intelligence, tools).  I mention all this stuff to show that I do 
<br>
<p>not have time to become a good nutritional scientist but want to find 
<br>
<p>and evaluate a number of experts who's advice is about as good as 
<br>
<p>it gets.
