<em>&gt; Jared Diamond disagrees with you.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read his books so I took a glance at the reviews of _The Third
<br>
Chimpanzee_ at amazon.com. The first review contains this interesting
<br>
passage:
<br>
<p>&quot;Having read the book _Ishmael_, by Daniel Quinn, a few years ago, I wonder
<br>
if Diamond's thinking could actually be improved by being combined with
<br>
Quinn's. Diamond suggests that, when prehistoric societies drove certain
<br>
animals to extinction, they were acting out a human tendency to be
<br>
destructive to our local environments that is simply horribly intensified
<br>
today. Quinn suggests that some of those prehistoric societies were not
<br>
particularly more destructive than other animals, and for the same reasons;
<br>
while other, more civilized societies had the tendency to be destructive
<br>
because of their cultures' inclinations, and passed this tendency on to us,
<br>
their cultural descendants.&quot;
<br>
<p>This comment is interesting to me for two reasons: first, I would disagree
<br>
adamantly with Diamond if he really suggests in his books that the hunting
<br>
of animals to extinction was a &quot;destructive tendency&quot; of hungry paleolithic
<br>
peoples who didn't know better, and second because I'm inclined to agree
<br>
with Daniel Quinn who believes civilized societies have often tended to be
<br>
more destructive than prehistoric societies. 
<br>
<p>Quinn by the way is popular among serious paleodiet purists who in some
<br>
cases try to make it a life-style as much as a diet.
