<p>Here's a little more in-depth description of what i mean. I apologize for
<br>
being so vague in my first message. I can provide further &quot;methods&quot; and
<br>
examples if you're interested Robert.
<br>
<p>excerpt taken with permission from LIARmag.com
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every child, in every culture is the inheritor of all the customs
<br>
and culture of its ancestors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We raise our children to be more of less like us. If we use toilet
<br>
paper, so do they. If we use our left hand to wipe, so do they. If we speak
<br>
English, so  d       do they. Italian, German Chinese, so do they.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We chose our title to remind people of the simple truth: We, every
<br>
single one of us, brainwash, train, hypnotize, mold our children to be part
<br>
of our local and preferred reality tunnels. This cultural hypnosis is so
<br>
ubiquitous, so pervasive, that for most people it is outside of their
<br>
awareness.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our title is intended to stimulate awareness that when it comes to
<br>
your children, you are the master who makes the grass green . . . or
<br>
whatever color you    choose. You are the brainwashing, kid training,
<br>
reality-artist responsible for establishing the foundation for your child's
<br>
reality. The fact is - every one of us and our children have been
<br>
brainwashed. The question is - how many of your programs are there with your
<br>
intention.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now people have feared and scoffed at brain technology and
<br>
programming. Our own most natural behaviors have been demonized and
<br>
condemned. Words like brainwashing and brain programming have been wholly
<br>
abused and misrepresented to the point where knowing how to use your brain
<br>
is considered odd by many people. But the brain is just misunderstood. It's
<br>
time to reclaim our language and our natural tendency to shape minds both
<br>
young and old. It's time to brainwash out in the open.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am brainwashing my child to use toilet paper.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am programming my daughter to be a Christian.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am hypnotizing my son to speak English.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of frankness does wonders for our understanding and
<br>
ability with our own brains. It keeps us aware of our responsibility in the
<br>
formation of our children and their worlds. It enables us to direct our
<br>
behavior with more honesty and intention. And it keeps us aware of the many
<br>
realities that exist.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; i think that one of the most important things any child can learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is how to operate themselves. How to use their neurology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Devon is right on the mark here.  One can't drive a car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until one learns what the steering wheel, brake pedal and accelerator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pedal do.  So too one would presume with the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So introducing them to a working theory of the brain as early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible seems like a good idea.  I would cite William Calvin's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work (<a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com/">http://www.williamcalvin.com/</a>) as a really good place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start unless something better comes along to displace his ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dawkins and E.O. Wilson might also be good uplifting foundation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materials.
</em><br>
<p>That's a really interesting site.
<br>
I also think that Jeff Leiken at www.mentorcounselor.com has some wonderful
<br>
ideas regarding children and mentoring the young.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As well, it would do well for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parents to be well-versed (or have someone someone else who is
</em><br>
well-versed)
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in applied behavioral technologies; NLP, Somatics, bio-electricity, etc
</em><br>
. .
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might be a little more careful here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've read the books on NLP and view it as quite interesting but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to see some scientific studies that &quot;prove&quot; it.
</em><br>
<p>With regard to &quot;proving&quot; NLP it gets very tricky. This is for many reasons.
<br>
First of all you have to decide what &quot;it&quot; is that you are proving in the
<br>
first place.
<br>
For example, is it that Language has an influence on the functioning of the
<br>
neurology as the name imples (Neuro Linguistic Programming). This seems
<br>
easily enough provable with some personal experimentation.
<br>
Or, is it to prove that there are definite semantic forms within each
<br>
language both at deep and surface structural levels? In this case there are
<br>
entire fields dedicated to the study. Such as semantics.
<br>
If the proof that your seeking is that people have internal images, if you
<br>
don't want to rely on your own internal experience than it will take a while
<br>
before science has the capability to measure the visual modality - although
<br>
there is significant study to demonstrate how visual cognition functions.
<br>
Also, for the more scholarly structure of NLP you can see Robert Dilts
<br>
extensive work.
<br>
But in general the concept of &quot;proof&quot; really begins to break down when you
<br>
are studying the implicit tool with which we interact and &quot;create&quot; the world
<br>
every day.
<br>
I have had very good results with the NLP technology both personally and
<br>
with clients and business.
<br>
<p>So, let me say that i wholeheartedly agree with you and i think that we need
<br>
to begin to use the tools we have and organize them. Pragmatically.
<br>
What does each system of consciousness offer us in terms of tools and
<br>
technology. How do they work in-time not as thoughts about thought but as
<br>
practical applied behavioral technologies.
<br>
<p>In this way i think that NLP is one of the more profound and informative
<br>
models of human functionality of any i've seen.
<br>
<p>In the realm of consiousness it seems that experience is the best teacher
<br>
because reality it may be, as Robert Anton Wilson says, &quot;not only weirder
<br>
than we think but weirder than can think.&quot; So the best tactic seems to me to
<br>
just get right in there and do it.
<br>
<p>What all of this brings us back to is the concept of learning how to learn;
<br>
of learning how the human system functions, and beginning to use it and
<br>
explore/exploit its potential - not in theory but in reality.
<br>
<p>The disciplines i suggested are to my experience some of the most powerful,
<br>
functional and accessible of the behavioral technology that exists.
<br>
They are only a small tasting of whats out there. They are also a group that
<br>
lends itself to the integration of the many behavioral technologys. They
<br>
provide useful and understandable language that helps to build communication
<br>
to previously disparite theories and bodies of knowledge. As we begin to
<br>
more intentionally integrate and utilize the models of consciousness
<br>
available to us within a larger and more unified discipline we bring more
<br>
pragmatism, fallibility, and good scientific method to all of our study (and
<br>
use) of human consciousness.
<br>
<p><p>With
<br>
<em>&gt; respect to somatics, I have little knowledge though I may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encountered it in some modified forms before, but it also seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to need some more verification.  I'm not sure what is meant by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;bio-electricity&quot; but one has to be careful -- while neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly work on electrical principles such terms can easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; push undiscriminating people over into the realm of crystals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angels, hobbits and leprechauns.
</em><br>
<p>in terms of somatics again i think the proof is in the experience. As for
<br>
&quot;bio-elecricity,&quot; i mean that in many ways, but for now that's keep it to
<br>
the bio-electric field which is a proven portion of the world whether that
<br>
proof be taken from the ayurvedic, homeopathic or allopathic systems.
<br>
<p>For me the interest in teaching children outside of traditional educational
<br>
systems is to teach them how their nervous system functions and how they can
<br>
use themselves best in everything they do.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Devon
