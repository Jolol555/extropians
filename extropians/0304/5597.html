</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't, and thats the point.  It wouldn't even
<br>
matter, since all I am asking for is a good illusion.
<br>
<p>Consider Joss Palmer in Contact (loooove that movie,
<br>
one of the rare instances where the film was better than
<br>
the book, better because it has such feeling, rare in
<br>
the science fiction genre).  Palmer more or less
<br>
acknowledges that his belief is based on an overwhelming
<br>
feeling that he once had, an emotional experience.  When
<br>
Dr. Arroway has her experience with the father-imitating
<br>
alien, she too realizes that her entire adventure
<br>
could have been an elaborate halucination, yet still
<br>
she comes to believe that the others are out there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your pals let you down for your own good.
</em><br>
<p>Granted, however I was a good churchman, and will
<br>
freely admit that I was in many ways a happier person
<br>
during those years in which the god-illusion was still
<br>
firm.  I never had any problems with the strict rules
<br>
of the church, didn't feel them overly restrictive, and
<br>
I miss that religion feeling.  Of course there is no
<br>
going back.  The extropian philosophy is a meager
<br>
substitute in some ways, but it has the advantage
<br>
of dealing with pysical reality, of having objective
<br>
truth to it.
<br>
<p>Interesting note: perhaps you have heard me mention
<br>
my favorite book, Goedel Escher Bach, the Eternal
<br>
Golden Braid, by Hofstadter.  In 1980 I read in that
<br>
work about self referencing paradox.  I realized that
<br>
the objective truth value of my religious belief
<br>
system was completely unverifiable since it was
<br>
entirely based on self reference.
<br>
<p>One good objective, non-self-referencial piece of
<br>
evidence was all I asked of religion, and none
<br>
could be provided, even if I were willing to settle
<br>
for a halucination.
