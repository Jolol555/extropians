<em>&gt; &gt; I didn't invent this notion.  The idea is an outgrowth of

</em><br>

<p>It seems like a pretty strange idea that the neo-cortex would have evolved
<br>
just to fill up space in a newly oversized skull. There'd have to be simpler
<br>
ways to do that (like some spac-filler). The brain is a bit complex, after
<br>
all. It seems like a silly idea to me.
<br>
<p>I have this weird notion that intelligence turned out to be a massive
<br>
competitive advantage, especially long term in making the organism more
<br>
adaptable. It seems to me that everything about humans is tuned to the
<br>
service of a general intelligence; fingers instead of claws, a mouth evolved
<br>
for speaking rather than devouring; a body which can travel pretty much
<br>
anywhere, while being pretty mediocre in any terrain; no fur, because
<br>
clothing is more immediately adaptable. The human form is a jack of all
<br>
trades, master of none; it just has to be minimally proficient in any
<br>
conceivable arena, and let the extraordinary mind think of ways to overcome
<br>
lack of specific physical competitiveness.
<br>
<p>I'm just making that up, but it's always seemed obvious to me (often an
<br>
indicator of being wrong). So is it wrong?
