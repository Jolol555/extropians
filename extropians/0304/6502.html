<p><em>&gt;I've resisted weighing in on this thread, but I think there are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couple important point to make about human adaptation to the paleo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) Paleolithic humans had a life expectancy of around 18 years.  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because they were adapted to a certain diet doesn't mean that it's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;healthiest diet for those who want to live much longer lifespans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It's important to note that this is an estimated mean life expectancy.  
<br>
Infant mortality would have accounted for a lot of that.  There's no 
<br>
evidence that the maximal lifespan has gotten any longer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) Related to point 1: Evolution selects for traits that maximized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survival to reproduction, total lifetime fertility, and little else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Selection ceases after last age of reproduction.  Selection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progressively weaker as less of the population is alive.  Since we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe that only about 10 - 15% of the paleolithic population made it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to age 40, and few of those survivors were reproducing, evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory tells us very little about what's healthy for humans past that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;age.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Evolution is a lot less perfect, and more inclusive than your first 
<br>
approximation.  The memory of the tribe, i.e. the elders, was a very 
<br>
important element in survival.  This is true even for animals that don't 
<br>
have language.  With the introduction of language it becomes even more 
<br>
true.  The elders remember that sometimes winters are difficult to live 
<br>
through, so just because it's been easy for the last few years doesn't 
<br>
mean you shouldn't prepare.  That when you are crossing this dessert, 
<br>
there is usually a spring behind that hill, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3) Humans are adapted to an environment with no antibiotics, no basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sanitation, minimal artificial heating and cooling, etc...   However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each of those innovations has dramatically increases life expectancy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Humans are also adapted to an environment involving living in small 
<br>
groups in an area where one encounters those outside the local family 
<br>
group (tribe) rarely.  And to a basically nomadic lifestyle (well, 
<br>
roaming over their territory in a path that took most of a year to 
<br>
complete).  In such a lifestyle antibiotics and sanitation aren't as 
<br>
useful as they might be thought.  Clothing, itself, is an artificial 
<br>
heating and cooling mechanism, and it seems to have been one of the 
<br>
earlier inventions (skin capes, at least).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So basically I don't see much value in pointing out that we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionarily adapted to a particular diet.  That might mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something or it might not. I put more faith in large scale studies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a more modern environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The value is limited largely because we are so recently evolved as a 
<br>
species.  Our very dentition, however, is shaped by prepared foods.  (It 
<br>
allows teeth to be smaller and more delicate.)  It's not clear that the 
<br>
chemical adaptations have proceeded at the same speed.  Perhaps we would 
<br>
be better off living on a diet of fruit, bugs, and occasional mice, 
<br>
squirrels, or gophers.  But I doubt it.  Still, there's much to be said 
<br>
for avoiding MacDonald's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Those studies indicate that regular cardiovascular exercise, moderate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;caloric consumption, low consumption of refined sugar, low consumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of saturated and oxidized fats, and high consumption of fruits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vegetables, and whole grains are all associated with higher life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expectancy.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mez 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Sounds both reasonable and unpleasant.  (The exercise, mainly... the 
<br>
rest, except for &quot;moderate caloric consumption&quot;, I already do.)
