<p>&lt;&lt; But imagine
<br>
&nbsp;moving just a little bit into a very likely future, where a
<br>
&nbsp;weapon technology exists that would make it possible for a
<br>
&nbsp;single person or small group to create and deploy a weapon that
<br>
&nbsp;would cause major damage to an entire country without warning.
<br>
&nbsp;If a person existed that were clearly mentally ill, had a
<br>
&nbsp;history of violence, had the means to deploy such a weapon, and
<br>
&nbsp;a clearly expressed irrational hatred for a certain people, I
<br>
&nbsp;would hardly blame those people for eliminating that clear
<br>
&nbsp;danger to their very existence at a lower level of threat--
<br>
&nbsp;say, proof that he had negotiated to buy materials for that
<br>
&nbsp;weapon--rather than waiting for a devastating loss. &gt;&gt;

<p>Where's Dr. Evil when ya really need him?!?  LOL (sorry, couldn't resist!)
