No offense Eliezer but I think people respond to gts because his arguments
<br>
are more interesting.  To me you are mostly saying go read the literature.
<br>
At this point go read the literature is my personal next step but it was
<br>
gts's
<br>
less rigorous arguments that got me to that step.  It is my feeling that gts
<br>
is
<br>
not mounting a convincing scientific argument but I don't expect him to.  I
<br>
don't really see a point to further discussion (other than having fun, which
<br>
I may)
<br>
because I assume that scientific papers and books will make better arguments
<br>
than gts.  Don't get me wrong your voice adds weight to the Paleodiet idea
<br>
but the point of discussion here is to raise interest and suggest that there
<br>
is
<br>
proof to be had.  I don't expect anyone to fully replicate the arguments
<br>
here.

<em>&gt; &gt; I'm glad to see another paleo-guy in this thread. I think that makes
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2.5 of us, where Eliezer seems to be the .5 :) (I'm still not clear
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what Eliezer really thinks, given that he keeps disagreeing with me even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; while I keep trying to agree with him :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't mind me.  Just being precise.  I count the right conclusion for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong reasons as a loss.  Specifically, I object to the way you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to claim the paleodiet is an a priori null hypothesis, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than an experimentally supported *new* null hypothesis.  A priori, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is nothing in particular to distinguish &quot;eat what your ancestors ate&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;eat what tastes good&quot; as evolutionarily motivated hypotheses.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensive research has shown that violation of ancestral invariants is bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for you, such as, e.g., eating ice cream, which mixes sugar and fat and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messes up your insulin appetite regulation mechanism.  You can't eat a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole stick of margerine.  Your body will scream &quot;Enough!&quot;  But mix lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fat with lots of sugar - which you almost never find in ancestral foods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - and you can eat a whole quart of ice cream.  It tastes good, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaks the engineering assumptions.  Is it bad for you?  Yes.   Does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taste good?  Yes.  Is it in the ancestral dietary range?  No.  So if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulate enough examples like these, you eventually conclude from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *investigation*, and not a priori argument, that the paleodiet is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; null hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've also noted a disturbing tendency for responders in this thread to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack the weakest arguments for the paleodiet - that means *yours*, gts -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than the strongest arguments, or those arguments which appear in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the literature.  In other words, gts, you're using an argument which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much weaker than necessary - I'm not sure why - and people who, for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odd reason, want to argue about this, are responding to you, instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading the literature.  Note that nobody is bothering to respond to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts, only yours.  This is because your posts are easy and fun to attack,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they use the weakest possible argument for a correct conclusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In my view the paleodiet is, however, still the base diet upon which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should formulate an optimal diet. Again, it's a question of
</em><br>
burden-of-proof.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As I see it, any deviation from the paleodiet needs to be justified by
</em><br>
solid
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because of the empirical regularity with which past deviations have turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to be negative.  *Not* because of a priori considerations.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paleodiet took its fair turn in the burden-of-proof barrel *and now it is*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good null hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trying to argue the a priori plausibility of paleodiet theory, without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citing the supporting evidence, is, in fact, a worthless argument.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go on providing a worthless argument for paleodiet theory, the skeptics in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this thread will go on arguing it to the exclusion of all other points
</em><br>
raised.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Accept that the burden of proof rests on paleo, then answer it.
