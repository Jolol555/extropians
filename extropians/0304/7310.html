<p>Study: Tea sharpens body's defense against germs
<br>
<p>By Paul Recer, Associated Press, 4/21/2003 17:05
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) A wee cuppa tea may help keep the doctor away.
<br>
<p>A new study finds that tea boosts the body's defenses against
<br>
infection and contains a substance that might be turned into a drug to
<br>
protect against disease, researchers say. Coffee does not have the
<br>
same effect, they say.
<br>
<p>A component in tea was found in laboratory experiments to prime the
<br>
immune system to attack invading bacteria, viruses and fungi,
<br>
according to a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
<br>
Sciences released Monday.
<br>
<p>A second experiment, using human volunteers, showed that immune system
<br>
blood cells from tea drinkers responded five times faster to germs
<br>
than did the blood cells of coffee drinkers.

<p>Same topic from the BBC:
<br>

<br>
<p>Tea helps fight off infections
<br>
<p>Drinking tea may prime the immune system to fight infections and even
<br>
cancer, researchers have said.
<br>
<p>The drink contains particular chemicals which are also present in some
<br>
bacteria, tumour cells, parasites and funghi.
<br>
<p>Because these are present in tea, the body is exposed to them so it
<br>
can build up a defence against them if it comes up against them as
<br>
part of a disease.
<br>
<p>The chemicals are called alkylamine antigens.
<br>
<p>US researchers looked at the effect of the antigens on gamma-delta T
<br>
cells in the immune system, which act as a first line of defence
<br>
against infection.
<br>
<p>Human gamma-delta T cells were exposed to an alkylamine antigen.
<br>
They were then exposed to bacteria to simulate an infection.
<br>
<p>Those cells which had been &quot;primed&quot; fought back against the bacteria,
<br>
by multiplying up to 10 times and secreting disease-fighting
<br>
chemicals.
<br>
<p>Cells which had not previously exposed to an alkylamine antigen showed
<br>
no significant response to the simulated infection.
<br>
<p>Tea versus coffee
<br>
<p>The researchers from Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical
<br>
School in Boston and the University of New Hampshire, Durham, then
<br>
looked to see if the results were replicated in tea drinkers.
<br>
<p>They asked volunteers to drink either five small cups of black tea or
<br>
coffee daily for up to four weeks.
<br>
<p>Green and black teas contain an alkylamine antigen and its precursor,
<br>
L-theanine, but coffee does not.
<br>
<p>After two weeks, gamma-delta T cells from tea drinkers were better
<br>
able to produce disease-fighting chemicals, but coffee drinkers were
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>The researchers say this suggests that drinking tea can promote a
<br>
strong immune response, in addition to other known health benefits.
<br>
<p>Tenuous
<br>
<p>Dr Emma Knight, science information officer at Cancer Research UK told
<br>
BBC News Online: &quot;The potential health benefits of tea have been
<br>
discussed for many years, primarily focusing on its anti-oxidant
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p>&quot;This study suggests that the nation's favourite drink might offer yet
<br>
another, unforeseen, benefit to our health.&quot;
<br>
<p>She added: &quot;It builds upon previous research, published in 1999, which
<br>
showed that these molecules could help immune cells grown in the
<br>
laboratory fight infections.
<br>
<p>&quot;The researchers now have early results suggesting that alkylamines in
<br>
tea might be able to boost our natural immune responses to infections.
<br>
<p>&quot;Intriguingly, some cancers also contain alkylamines, opening up the
<br>
possibility that exposure to these molecules could help our immune
<br>
systems fight cancer.
<br>
<p>&quot;This link is currently very tenuous and further research is needed to
<br>
address the role of these molecules in cancer.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bill Gorman, executive director of the Tea Council, said the research
<br>
was added evidence of the benefits of drinking tea.
<br>
<p>He said: &quot;Next to water, tea is the most consumed beverage in the
<br>
world, and as a result, has attracted an enormous quantity of research
<br>
over the years.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is a huge body of scientific evidence showing that tea can make
<br>
a significant contribution to a healthy lifestyle, and in particular,
<br>
in the areas of cardiovascular health and dental hygiene&quot;.
<br>
<p>But he added: &quot;As with all science, there is some way to go before
<br>
conclusive proof is established, but the message emerging for the
<br>
scientific research into tea is very encouraging indeed.&quot;
<br>
<p>The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy
<br>
of Science.
