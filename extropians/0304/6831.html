</em><br>
<p>Suddenly the sanctions have gone from killing 5000 children a month
<br>
to being funny.  Russia is against removing the sanctions for only
<br>
one reason: sticking it to the U.S.  When an &quot;accommodation&quot; is reached,
<br>
presumably the Russians will get a bigger piece of the pie by playing
<br>
hardball.
<br>
<p>Samantha, are you really sure that you favor lifting the sanctions
<br>
now (as your comment above indicates)?  At the present time, this
<br>
would help the U.S.  Or have I heard wrong?
