<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Such as one where one person owns all the land?  Or would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; redistribution there still be a violation of the sacred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rights of property?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's exactly the right question, and it was the one asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by a number of American administrations in the 1950s - 1980s,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when they were doing whatever they could---hang preconceptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and ideology---to keep nations in Latin America and Africa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from falling into the hands of the Russians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In some cases they were doing all they could to keep the nations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the hands of the nations' own people and their duly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elected representatives.
</em><br>
<p>For what motive?  That is, in your model of reality, what would
<br>
the motive of the U.S. have been to avoid having the land fall
<br>
into the hands of a nation's own people?
<br>
<p>From earlier postings, I get the feeling that you just believe
<br>
U.S. foreign policy to be intrinsically wicked, so that it would
<br>
of course immediately follow that it would have as its first
<br>
priority the detriment of the people, which ignores incentives,
<br>
and is a dumb reading of history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not believe that all of this was only about keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Russians from grabbing these countries. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, then, which country's land distribution would you
<br>
like to discuss first?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I especially do not believe when our policies did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become more hands-off after the fall of the USSR.
</em><br>
<p>Please provide an example.
<br>
<p>Lee
