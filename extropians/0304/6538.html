<em>&gt; &quot;On a hunter-gatherer diet it is very nearly impossible to get

</em><br>
<p>On a hunter-gatherer diet it is very nearly impossible to get the
<br>
levels of micronutrients that I consume in my once a day vitamin.
<br>
Does that mean they're bad?
<br>
<p>On a hunter-gatherer diet it's very nearly impossible to consume
<br>
antibiotics.  Should I stop using them if I have an infection?
<br>
<p>If my examples are off the mark, then how do you differentiate good
<br>
examples vs. bad ones?
<br>
<p>Our hunter-gather ancestors frequently died of *famine*.  They had
<br>
much higher levels of physical activity than is the norm for today.
<br>
They were at radically greater risk of death from infectious diseases
<br>
than we are.  They virtually never experienced heart disease, cancer,
<br>
or stroke because they were almost all *dead* before the age at which
<br>
those became risk factors.  75% of them were dead by age 18!  So this
<br>
line of argument about what they're adapted to eating is interesting,
<br>
but its relevance to humans in the modern world is murky, at best.
