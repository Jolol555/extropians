Lee,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I didn't say, or imply, that the number was dishonest; 
</em><br>
<p>You did here in your last sentence:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Actually, [gts] claimed 94%. According the USDA Food and Nutrition
</em><br>
Information Center, 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; an 84g serving of what they call &quot;Turkey, all classes, light meat,
</em><br>
roasted&quot; has 132 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; calories, 2.7g of fat, and 25.12g of protein, which would make calories
</em><br>
from protein just
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; over 80%. I'm not sure how whatever product he's calling &quot;lean turkey
</em><br>
breast&quot; compares to 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what the USDA was measuring, but it wouldn't surprize me if such a
</em><br>
product could be
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; produced that pushed the number up to 94%. It would probably be more
</em><br>
honest to quote
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the 80% figure.
</em><br>
<p>As I've written, a lot of people don't care for the fatty dark meat or the
<br>
fatty skin, so I think it was perfectly honest for me to quote the figure
<br>
for the skinless turkey breast of the most flavorable and appealing kind of
<br>
turkey (fryer-roaster). And the discussion was specifically about *lean*
<br>
meats.
<br>
<p>In any case we're getting side-tracked here by trivial issues. 
<br>
<p>Pound for pound, lean meats like skinless turkey breast are the richest
<br>
natural sources of essential protein-grams. I think we can all agree with
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>-gts
