From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky [mailto:<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=RE:%20evolution%20and%20diet%20(was:%20FITNESS:%20Diet%20and%20Exercise)">sentience@pobox.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; The way Paleo diet theory works is that you make sense of the human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metabolism by assuming that it evolved to fit a Paleolithic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet, then you feed that metabolism whatever makes it work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best, whether or not that constitutes a Paleolithically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic food supply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Think of it as a two-cycle step:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Early humans adapt toward metabolisms making better use of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available paleolithic diet.  I.e., metabolism optimized for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Modern humans deduce which modernly possible diet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides the best fuel for the evolved metabolism.  I.e., diet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimized for presented metabolism.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.  My skepticism remains and is focused on
<br>
the concept of optimization.
<br>
<p>Optimized for what?  For rapid growth?  For least energy used in
<br>
breaking down the food?  For greatest free glucose to feed the brain?
<br>
For largest energy supply to hunt and fend off predators?  For longest
<br>
life in our ancestral environment?  For longest life today?
<br>
<p>These things are not necessarily compatible.  A caloric restriction
<br>
diet probably slows human aging but would almost certainly have been
<br>
fatal in prehistoric times due to its side effects and increased
<br>
vulnerability to famine.  
<br>
<p>A red meat and refined sugar based diet would have been fantastic for
<br>
our paleolithic ancestors - lots of calories, rapid growth, lots of
<br>
protein for building muscle and healing wounds, lots of glucose to
<br>
fuel the brain.  Since our paleolithic ancestors almost all died off
<br>
during childhood or early adulthood, they would never be affected by
<br>
the high rates of diabetes and heart disease that come from such a
<br>
diet.  For modern humans, heart disease is the number one killer.
<br>
<p>Here's another example - one of the more promising genes found to slow
<br>
aging in drosophila is the INDY gene.  Fruit flies with a mutant copy
<br>
of INDY live almost twice as long as genetical normal fruit flies and
<br>
have normal vigor, behavior, fertility, etc...  The only downside we
<br>
know of today is reduced fertility at low food levels.
<br>
<p>How does the INDY gene mutant work?  It makes metabolism *less
<br>
efficient* by mucking up a carboxylase cotransporter.
<br>
<p>So again, I'll say that optimizing a diet for our evolved metabolism
<br>
is not necessarily going to produce health, longevity, or fitness
<br>
benefits.
