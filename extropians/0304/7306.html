<em>&gt; Who thinks that we should &quot;choose something nutritionally sound, like a

<p>Did you misread the page? You seem to be quoting from the examples of 
<br>
bad dietary advice. Certainly there are things on that site that reduce 
<br>
its credibility, but I mainly provided the link because it was one of 
<br>
the first things I googled up. If you poke around you can find more 
<br>
scientific reports of enhanced endurance athlete results when training 
<br>
on high fat diets. There are also many historical examples of pioneers 
<br>
in North America for example who performed very long edurance feats 
<br>
while eating high fat foods like the indian pemmican product.
<br>
<p>All I'd like to do is point out that there remains a fair contingent of 
<br>
people, including around 2 million people in Poland currently (&quot;Optimal 
<br>
Diet&quot;), Eskimos and plains indians of the past, etc. who seem to live in 
<br>
amazingly good health while on high fat diets. Most research I've seen 
<br>
on this subject generally suffers from serious flaws, and I think it's 
<br>
worth going back and re-examining the currently accepted beliefs about 
<br>
fat intake just as we also are re-examining our beliefs about carbs and 
<br>
what really causes many degenerative/older-age diseases.
