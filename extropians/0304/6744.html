<p>An argument is made by some that the extinction of the megafauna in
<br>
Australia coincided with the arrival of humans, and that this is not a
<br>
coincidence. On the one hand, perhaps climate change drove both events. On
<br>
the other, perhaps the newly arrived humans did not *destructively hunt
<br>
them all down and kill them*. Rather, they set fires that accidentally
<br>
ripped through the dry landscape and destroyed the prevailing ecology quite
<br>
quickly, zapping the larger marsupials. This evolved eventually into a
<br>
commensal arrangement of firestick farming or landscape management
<br>
developed across millennia, sustaining the emergent ecological balance;
<br>
with the arrival of Europeans two centuries ago this was interrupted, the
<br>
regular burn-offs stopped, leading to appalling conflagrations today (akin
<br>
to those that devastate wealthy Californian zones that once burned more
<br>
frequently). The trouble with this second model, it seems to me, is that
<br>
lightning strikes set plenty of fires anyway, so there must have been a
<br>
climatic change newly conducing to widespread tinderbox conditions.
