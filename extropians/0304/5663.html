<p>To which Samantha responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;Actually, there is some argument that the situation was never 
<br>
quite so much like that as US intelligence and defense 
<br>
communities claimed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then please provide this argument or some links to it.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;But it sure was great for justifying a lot 
<br>
of nasty things.  Of course, post 1989 we didn't exactly change 
<br>
our spots.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, please provide some substantiation for this claim (Cold War and 
<br>
beyond) rather than rhetoric.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They devoted 14% of their GNP to military uses, but would
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The choice, as Max Plumm has eloquently explained, was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;tyranny&quot; in a developing country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but between &quot;pro-U.S. authoritarianism&quot; and &quot;pro-Soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarianism&quot; in those places.  It's still an open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question even today whether democracy is at all possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This is a gross simplification that I doubt very much was the 
<br>
case in most of the things we were involved in.&quot;
<br>
<p>If that is your belief, than illustrate that it is a gross simplification.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is hard to 
<br>
see how it had anything to do with most our actions outside of 
<br>
Cuba in Central America or with any of our actions in Latin 
<br>
American countries or with most of our actions in the MidEast 
<br>
except for Afghanistan.&quot;
<br>
<p>Please elaborate on specific actions if you are going to take such a hostile 
<br>
and critical stance against US intervention abroad.
<br>
<p>&quot;The fight against communisum moved out 
<br>
of the McCarthy era into our foreign policy as justification for 
<br>
all things.  Communist were doubtless considered to be behind 
<br>
anyting anywhere that wasn't going quite as we wished it to go.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>This is simply absurd. Churchill's &quot;Iron Curtain Speech&quot; occured in 1946, and 
<br>
our heavy aid to the Greek Royalists against the Communists began in 1947, 
<br>
before the McCarthy era picked up sufficient steam. Where specifically in 
<br>
your view did we inappropriately blame Communism and the Soviet Union? I find 
<br>
it difficult to believe you would say that was the case in Greece, Cuba, 
<br>
Korea, Indochina, or Afghanistan, the major fronts of the Cold War. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;We really shouldn't believe such rhetoric as &quot;we were 
<br>
fighting communism and that is why we did all these things&quot; 
<br>
without a lot of careful examination.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then engage in an examination of the record, something that you have been 
<br>
consistently unwilling to do. It is not appropriate to take such a stance and 
<br>
then make &quot;hit and run&quot; comments such as this one.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
