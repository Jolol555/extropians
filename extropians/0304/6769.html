<em>&gt;  &gt; But forbidding a below-minimum wage contract does not make the poor

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  contrary, as &gt; evidenced by current levels of unemployment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Regardless of one's ideology, &gt; minimum wage laws are irrational,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  whether you want to benefit the rich or &gt; the poor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  As far as I'm aware there's no substantial empirical evidence linking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  unemployment with increases in the minimum wage, if there were such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  strong effect as you suggest I'd expect such data to be easy to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by. Certainly blaming the current economic downturn on the minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  wage is foolish, several steps sillier than the choice of words you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  call me on below.
</em><br>
<p>### Of course, the current depression is not due to minimal wage laws (maybe
<br>
to some minimal extent), however, it is a reliable observation that limits
<br>
on the freedom of contract in employment tend to correlate with
<br>
unemployment, all else being equal. This is observed in Germany, for
<br>
example. Also, minimum wage laws have their most pernicious impact on the
<br>
very people they are supposed to help - the unskilled or young workers.
<br>
While introducing a minimum wage law doesn't necessarily greatly increase
<br>
the total level of unemployment, it does increase the difficulty in finding
<br>
a job at the lowest level.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But I do want to be clear I'm sympathetic to your position - it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  well be, in the final analysis, the minimum wage is simply not a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  useful tool for achieving the kind of ideological objective I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  outlined in my previous post. I might add &quot;irrational&quot; is a loaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  term, that we disagree doesn't necessarily mean I'm foaming at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mouth: One could look at the minimum wage as a legislative mechanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for mitigating the enormous transaction costs inherent to collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bargaining. (I liked Damien Sullivan's remark on this point further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  up this thread very much.)
</em><br>
<p>### I do think that our goals are very much in synch.
<br>
<p>I do not think that legislation lowers transaction costs, except if it
<br>
imposes requirements of disclosure of information on the parties involved.
<br>
Any other limitations are likely to be destructive (but this is a whole
<br>
complex subject).
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  One point to be clear about though, and one that often doesn't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  taken seriously enough in this sort of abstract argument from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  principle, is that while a particular policy tool might not be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ideal choice from the perspective of an armchair theorist, it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be the only one which is politically achievable. Even if we were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agree the minimum wage is an inefficient means of achieving a goal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  one might still support it because it's here, it does some good, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the superior alternatives aren't going to happen. If you actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  want to talk about the real world, you've got to deal with what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and not what should be: I'd trade the minimum wage for a negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  payroll tax in an instant, but as a practical matter it's foolish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  let the good be the enemy of the just-about-adequate.
</em><br>
<p>### Taking the easy way is not in the long run going to result in good
<br>
outcomes, I think. If &quot;politically achievable&quot; means allowing large groups
<br>
of people to avoid taking responsibility for their actions (as in shifting
<br>
the financial burden of supporting the poor to a small group of businesses),
<br>
then it is better not to achieve. In the long run, removing the economic
<br>
feedback loops from political decisions will lead to catastrophes, as always
<br>
when incompetent users remove built-in safety measures from e.g. steam
<br>
engines and nuclear reactors.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Also, the use of &quot;dignity&quot; as a general catch-phrase to bolster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  one's &gt; ideology is manipulative. No nice person would oppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;dignity&quot;, and this is &gt; why so many want to twist the meaning of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the word to sell the pet project. &gt; There is nothing undignified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with sharing an apartment with others (as I do, &gt; to save money). If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can do it, the janitors can do it as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But that's the whole point of rhetoric, to make such a compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  case no reasonable, nice person could possibly disagree!
</em><br>
<p>### Which is why the piercing intellect always ruthlessly tears rhetoric
<br>
tricks apart, to let the truth shine in its glory! :-)
<br>
<p><p>------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What I mean by dignity is open to discussion, it's an admittedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  vague concept: I live in Manhattan where you can barely find a *room*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in a shared apartment for less than $1000 a month: If the woman who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cleans my place has to take the train in I don't see that as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  great insult to the rights of man. I would like her to be able to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to the doctor when she gets sick though, or get her teeth fixed if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  they start to hurt, and maybe even take her kid to a movie and buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  some popcorn every once in a while. Does that give you a better sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  what I'm getting at?
</em><br>
<p>### Now, this is also know as &quot;basic needs generosity&quot; (except the movie and
<br>
popcorn), a concept I very much agree with. Apparently the vast majority of
<br>
humans (all the nice ones) agree that BNG for the deserving poor is a
<br>
fundamental duty of all of us, unfortunately, these good intentions
<br>
frequently get perverted when it comes to paying for them, and the political
<br>
system allows little tricks to be used (&quot;I voted for Democrats!&quot;) instead of
<br>
genuinely discharging this duty of solidarity.
