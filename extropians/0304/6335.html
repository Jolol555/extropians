<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't understand how you can say that breads and pasta hold up

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I look at the labels and do the math and get decent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Practically any vegetable is more nutrient-dense than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agricultural product.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, definitely. 
</em><br>
<p>Okay then, that's all I mean. Breads and pasta, including whole breads, just
<br>
can't hold a candle to real natural foods like fruits and vegetables and
<br>
meats and nuts. Breads and pasta are ~50% carb (i.e., ~50% sugar) and
<br>
compared to other carb containing foods like fruits and veggies they have
<br>
practically no redeeming qualities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you have to get calories too.  
</em><br>
<p>As I stated in my previous post, I am not suggesting that anyone expect to
<br>
obtain every calorie from vegetables. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link between saturated fat and heart disease seems pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong, so I'd be careful with the meat and fowl.
</em><br>
<p>If you cut out the dairy fat then the saturated fats in lean meats and
<br>
poultry are not a problem.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And I'm on a budget.  Grains and beans are cheap.  
</em><br>
<p>I won't argue that point. The cheapness of grains is unfortunate; it's one
<br>
reason that America is currently experiencing an epidemic in obesity and
<br>
type II diabetes. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look, my main objection is people acting as if grains are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empty calories. They're not. 
</em><br>
<p>Okay, but you'll have to grant me this much: if the term &quot;empty calories&quot;
<br>
has any meaning beyond simple sugar then grains are it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The aborigines you mentioned have learned to grind seeds to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; flour,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not flour, breaking up seed cases.
</em><br>
<p>That's flour.
<br>
<p>Seeds are not digestible. Smashed seeds are digestible. Items indigestible
<br>
in their natural state are by definition not paleolithic. 
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that our true paleolithic ancestors were not exactly the
<br>
sharpest tools in the shed. We did however nevertheless inherit their genes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I speak of the Okinawans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have more (and more active) nonagenarians than anyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and who eat a lot of rice.  White rice, even.  But they also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat lots of fish and vegetables and drink lots of green tea
</em><br>
<p>Right. Good thing for them that they eat fish and veggies and drink green
<br>
tea.
