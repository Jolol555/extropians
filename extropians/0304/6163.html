<p>No, I certainly don't regret the way the last election went, at least with 
<br>
regards to foreign policy (the primaries on the other hand...).  I think 
<br>
that going to war was actually the right move, and that yes, the 
<br>
cooperation of the French could never have been had.  On the other hand, 
<br>
I'm sorry that we weren't able to get the Canadians on board with us, and I 
<br>
think that there have been several presidents in the last century that 
<br>
could have managed it.
