<p>1A is approximately possible using nanobot sensing at
<br>
the cellular/atomic level -- I'm not sure that you
<br>
can make it perfect.
<br>
<p>1B is probably possible with a destructive readout of
<br>
the state of a cryonically suspended individual.
<br>
<p>Not proposed is 1C -- in which you may do a destructive
<br>
readout but at the same time reassemble the original.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about these two scenarios:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2A: Do a duplication and leave the original intact
</em><br>
<p>This seems surprisingly close to 1A done with the nanobots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2B: Don't do a duplication, just leave the original alone
</em><br>
<p>Then you are dead, dead, dead.  Do nothing to develop a
<br>
distributed replicated intelligence and eventually your
<br>
hazard function catches up with you.
<br>
<p>Now, as I think Harvey pointed out there are some creative
<br>
approaches to this that involve a gradual evolution and perhaps
<br>
distribution of your intelligence that would not involve
<br>
outright copying.  So teleportation and immortality are not
<br>
&quot;strongly&quot; linked -- but one has to be very clever about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I've never heard anyone expressing a sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;duplication imperative&quot;, a feeling that any missed opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicate would be as bad as destructive duplication.
</em><br>
<p>I would assert that non-duplication is much worse than destructive
<br>
duplication.  Individuals are information containers -- potentially this
<br>
information (their experiences) might save future human lives (and their
<br>
information). It seems likely that *if* this information is preserved in
<br>
some way that in the future that we will develop the methods to read-out
<br>
and distribute this information so that others may benefit from it.
<br>
<p>To allow the destruction of information that might be of benefit
<br>
is certainly unextropic and perhaps immoral.
<br>
<p>If the only option is &quot;destructive duplication&quot; then I would consider
<br>
it highly responsible for all extropians to consider it as an option.
