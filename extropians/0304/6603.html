<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20GOV:%20US%20Reputation%20(RE:%20Arab%20World%20Stunned%20by%20Baghdad's%20Fall)">samantha@objectent.com</a> quotes: If I wait until your gun is literally smoking 
<br>
it's too late for me, I'm dead. If I see you pull out a gun and point it at 
<br>
me I'm going to do my damn best to get my gun smoking before yours. Is my 
<br>
&quot;audience&quot; happy about that?
<br>
I don't care. Am I &quot;justified&quot;? I don't care because I'm better than 
<br>
justified, I'm alive.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then responds, &quot;Do you care that you are alive as a lawless bully that 
<br>
very well may have just killed other people for no reason whatsoever?  Is 
<br>
that life of the kind you want to live?
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the most amazing response I can imagine.  If John waits until 
<br>
he is shot then you can claim he has no right to defend himself because the 
<br>
conclusion that he is about to be killed is also pre-emptive.  Then when John 
<br>
is dead it is too late and you can claim that he shouldn't take a life anyway 
<br>
because it is too late for him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why when under the treat of death or serious injury it is the 
<br>
person being threatened that makes the decision as to where to draw the line. 
<br>
&nbsp;Even a court only asks that he make the same decision a reasonable person 
<br>
would.
