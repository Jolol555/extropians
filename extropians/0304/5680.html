</em><br>
<p>Are you sure that a hallucination would be sufficient for you? 
<br>
As one who is subject to occassional mystical experiences I ask 
<br>
the question.  In my experience such things are quite 
<br>
overwhelming and very difficult to not take as big T Truth.  But 
<br>
they are ultimately not convincing to the intellect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A loose paraphase of an Arthur C. Clarke comment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says that any contact between two civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of vastly different technological ability is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive to the less advanced.  Perhaps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aliens (gods) are not talking on purpose.  spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, if we are talking about God vs some other more advanced 
<br>
species which had no real creative role in this mess I think we 
<br>
are talking about something a bit different than what A.C. had 
<br>
in mind.  Any being claiming to be the Creator is subject to 
<br>
questions about why this type of universe, why this much 
<br>
suffering, why the silent routine, to what end and so on.  Since 
<br>
most of the world's people have claimed to believe in such a 
<br>
being and still do, I doubt that being forthcoming (to say the 
<br>
least) would be terribly destructive.
