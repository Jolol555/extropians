<p>That's one defensible answer for a Bayesian.
<br>
<p>The classic form of the brainteaser runs as follows.  You meet a 
<br>
mathematician, who says he has two children.  You ask &quot;Is at least one of 
<br>
your children a boy?&quot; and the mathematician answers yes.  In this case, of 
<br>
course, the chance that the remaining child is a girl is 2/3.
<br>
<p>If you meet a mathematician who just happens to remark &quot;At least one of my 
<br>
children is a boy&quot;, it is obvious that he is trying to pose the above 
<br>
brainteaser.  We can suppose a prior 1/4 chance that he has two boys, a 
<br>
prior 1/4 chance that he has two girls, and a 1/2 chance that he has a 
<br>
boy-girl or girl-boy pair.  If he has two boys, he must pose the 
<br>
brainteaser by saying &quot;At least one of my children is a boy.&quot;  If he has 
<br>
two girls, he must pose the brainteaser by saying &quot;At least one of my 
<br>
children is a girl.&quot;  We suppose that if he has a mixed pair, he is 
<br>
equally likely to pose the question one way or the other.  If the 
<br>
mathematician says &quot;At least one of my children is a boy&quot;, the 
<br>
probabilities to consider are p(.25)*p(1) and p(.50)*p(.50).  So it is 
<br>
equally probable that the mathematician's other child is a boy or a girl.
<br>
<p>But if I encountered this situation in real life, I'd guess around an 80% 
<br>
chance that the mathematician had a mixed pair.  Why?  Because the 
<br>
mathematician knows that the mixed pair is the &quot;correct&quot; answer, and would 
<br>
be less likely to choose this problem as a good illustration if that were 
<br>
not actually the case...
