<p><em>&gt;     I want also to point out that the Shiite cleric Khoei who was murdered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Iraqi's, and whom the USA backed (according to the news), was not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend to the USA.  The USA has a history of supporting and empowering new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leadership (e.g. Qadhdhafi of Libya) over their predecessors and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these new leaders turn out to be very poor choices. I am afraid that the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going to make such a mistake again in Iraq. The USA support of Khoei is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fueling my fears.
</em><br>
<p>What would be the attributes of a &quot;good&quot; choice, and why
<br>
do you think that it's possible for any choice to create
<br>
a situation in Iraq that would meet with our hopes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     I saw or read in the news a few days ago that Khoei supported the USA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is just not true. Khoei, according to information from the same news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources, simply told his followers not to interfere. However, this is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping with very strict Muslim tradition. He would not support the USA by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking his followers to kill other Muslims; most especially not to fight on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the side of the satanic USA.  I believe, based on my many years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience with the Muslim community, that if Khoei had been in power in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place of Hussein, then we would find that he was as anywhere from as open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and loving as Ayatollah Khamenei to as sweet and charitable as Bin Laden.
</em><br>
<p>Is there anyone you know of, or any group, that you hope
<br>
gains power there?

<p><em>&gt; My point is that Japan's stable democracy and freedom are not
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; censorship and price-control-induced food shortages.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it could have been better.  But historically they should
<br>
be given credit, IMO, because all earlier occupations that I
<br>
know of would have been much harsher.  This is all the more
<br>
remarkable since by 1946, the cold war wasn't really in full
<br>
swing, and none of the liberality of the occupation can be
<br>
attributed---as so much was to be just a few years hence---
<br>
to fighting the U.S.S.R.
