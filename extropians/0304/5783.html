<p>
When I teleport, I want to anticipate a 100% subjective probability of 
<br>
being where I'm going, not a 50% subjective probability of being where I'm 
<br>
going.  I therefore want to be moved, not copied.
<br>
<p>When I teleport, I prefer a &quot;destructive&quot; move to a nondestructive copy 
<br>
for the same reason that, given many-worlds theory, I'd rather have a 
<br>
million dollars in cash than buy a lottery ticket based on quantum-random 
<br>
information.  There may be a 100% probability that *at least one of my 
<br>
branches* wins the lottery, but I want to anticipate a 100% *subjective* 
<br>
probability of having the money.  Similarly, when I teleport, I prefer a 
<br>
&quot;destructive&quot; move to a nondestructive copy because I want to anticipate a 
<br>
100% probability of the &quot;reward&quot;, in this case, being in the place I want 
<br>
to be.
<br>
<p>I don't really regard the move as &quot;destructive&quot; because if a pattern goes 
<br>
from time T to time T+1 through a series of causal interactions that 
<br>
involve interim storage on a hard drive, that's no more and no less 
<br>
continuity of pattern than the physical state of my body at time T+1 being 
<br>
determined by the unitary evolution of quantum mechanics from my physical 
<br>
state at time T.  It's *all* quantum mechanics.  The hard drive is quantum 
<br>
mechanics too.  Does it matter how many interactions there are?  What 
<br>
matters is just that you have a set of conditional probabilities which, 
<br>
applied in sequence, arrive at a developed pattern P2 for time T+1 which 
<br>
echoes the history of pattern P1 at time T.
<br>
<p>It certainly doesn't matter &quot;which&quot; particles you use.  You can't possibly 
<br>
understand, say, Bose-Einstein statistics, and not realize that.  Having 
<br>
photon A at position X and photon B at position Y is not just a state 
<br>
*indistinguishable* from B at X and A at Y, it is a state *identical* to B 
<br>
at X and A at Y, the *same state*, *exactly*, which is why we add the two 
<br>
complex probability amplitudes for ending up in that state.
