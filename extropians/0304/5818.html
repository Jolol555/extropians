E.S. Yudkowsky, in replying to H. Finney stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Yes, I think this may be the origin of our disagreement.  Under my current 
<br>
formulation of ethics, I automatically renormalize any number of 
<br>
duplicates or many-world branches such that their total subjective 
<br>
probability from my current standpoint is 100%.  Why should we renormalize 
<br>
probabilities for computationally independent branches of many-worlds, and 
<br>
yet not renormalize them for ordinary duplicates?  After the split, the 
<br>
duplicates will be two independent people who are each worth One Person. 
<br>
But the original Eliezer, who did the splitting, is also only worth One 
<br>
Person - that there are two of him in the future does not change this. 
<br>
Instead, when calculating his One Person's worth, we weight each of 
<br>
Eliezer-A's and Eliezer-B's futures by 50% apiece, or if it's a 
<br>
many-worlds branch...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I don't mean this post to become a book review, but this author's works 
<br>
dovetail precisely with this thread, and thus, caught my interest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In engineer and science fiction writer, Wil McCarthy's books,* the 
<br>
characters 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are limited on scope to a single universe, but &quot;Faxing&quot; using quantum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teleportation  is the technological that is operational. Using 
<br>
something like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeilinger's quantum teleportation; people are &quot;backed up&quot; as they 
<br>
travel at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lightspeed, using this technology. If someone perished between faxes, 
<br>
(travel) a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residual copy is then generated and the person is brought back to 
<br>
life, sans the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days weeks or months since the original version was last &quot;faxed.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some slight  philosophical reflection, on a 
<br>
transportation system
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that disintegrates (kills) its passengers; resurrects a copy at the 
<br>
destination 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point, on whether it is the same individual, the same personality, 
<br>
the same 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul? There is reference in McCarthy's novels to a Fax War in the 
<br>
distant past
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(copies battling for ownership)?
<br>
<p>Would, that the human species had such a dilemma as faxing/duplications!
<br>
Faxing also solves all medical issues, because if someone is seriously 
<br>
injured, or ill; the solution is to send the patient through the fax at one 
<br>
end, set the controls to delete the illness or injury, and a fresh copy pops 
<br>
out the other end, healthy. In essence, most people in McCarthy's works are 
<br>
immortal. 
<br>
<p>The duplicates lives on with the intact memories and experiences of the 
<br>
damaged or deceased original, save that they are fully healthy and young. 
<br>
Yes, there are more than one copy allowed in McCarthy's solar system, but I 
<br>
haven't seen how he resolves the grab for resources, identify, legality, or 
<br>
validity.
