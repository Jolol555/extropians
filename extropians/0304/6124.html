<p>There's a lot of spin you can put on some cheering crowds.  I'll
<br>
try to take a realistic view, although it's probably just the kind
<br>
of &quot;negative spin&quot; you had in mind.
<br>
<p>You need to consider that there is a selection effect going on.
<br>
Those population parts that welcome the Coalition troops will cheer
<br>
publically.  Those that don't will stay out of sight.  Just how
<br>
much of the overall population is happy with the turn of events is
<br>
difficult to tell.
<br>
<p>Undoubtedly there are a lot of people who want to make sure they
<br>
are visibly on the right (i.e. victorious) side.  I would like to
<br>
remind you that a few weeks ago there were still large crowds
<br>
cheering very convincingly for Hussein and the Baath regime and
<br>
chanting against the US.  It would be very interesting to learn how
<br>
large the overlap is between those and the ones now displaying the
<br>
reverse sentiment.
<br>
<p>Some media reports have been trying to give the ongoing looting a
<br>
political spin, seeing it as an expression against the fallen regime.
<br>
Somehow I suspect more base motivations.
<br>
<p>What I find _far_ more telling than scenes of questionable public
<br>
jubilation is that there was only token resistance offered to the
<br>
occupation of Baghdad.  Clearly the Iraqi forces and local population
<br>
were overwhelmingly unwilling to die for Fuehrer and Vaterland.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I didnt see any Iraqi people protesting their own liberation!!!
</em><br>
<p>There actually were a few, according to the news in this part of
<br>
the world.
