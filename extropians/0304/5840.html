<p><em>&gt; You're missing the very complex part of the model that shows how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenue an entrepreneur can generate per employee.  Personnel are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest cost in almost all businesses. You are also missing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxation cost of enforcing a minimum wage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That and workers never becoming entrepreneurs is silly.  It's a dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equilibrium at best, and the number of entrepreneurs is all over the map
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with legislation, cost of money, industry you have in mind, etc, etc...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but my goal is to find the minimum number of assumptions,
<br>
(and if possible to minimize their implausibility), that would
<br>
enable anyone to think that minimum wage is a good idea.

<p><em>&gt; Generally, with a higher minimum wage there will be fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers employed, but the details of that generalization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will depend very much on the specifics of the case.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; With a higher minimum wage, there would probably be fewer people employed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for several reasons: there may be some substitutability between people and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, so if people get more expensive, some work tasks will shift
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to technology;
</em><br>
<p>So I can begin to list the (faulty) assumptions that cause some
<br>
people to support minimum wage laws.
<br>
<p>1. Higher minimum wage does not eliminate the existence of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs due to advances in technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; expenses to produce products will be higher, so there will tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be fewer products consumed and so fewer people employed;
</em><br>
<p>2. There is no supply and demand relationship affecting the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value of worker efforts, (and hence their retainability)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and some tasks just can't be done economically above a certain price,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so those jobs will be eliminated if the minimum wage is above that price.
</em><br>
<p>3. Jobs are givens: in black and white terms, society needs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to perform and will perform a job X, or it will not
<br>
<p>(Hal also mentions situations in which his three factors would
<br>
not necessarily apply.)
