</em><br>
<p>I think the hypothesis mentioned by Eliezer is a perfect diet hypothesis for
<br>
a world in which modern technologies like animal husbandry and agriculture
<br>
do not exist. Until recently it was the diet plan to which homo sapiens were
<br>
best adapted. It worked well for millions of years. However the picture
<br>
changed drastically when Old McDonald had a Farm, e i e i o. 
<br>
<p>I really like your post, I William Wiser. It shows a sincere interest in
<br>
human diet, as opposed to just an interest in argument for argument's sake.

<p><em>&gt; I saw a book by Loren Cordain recently.  The bibliography
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked nice.  
</em><br>
<p>I have Cordain's book. The bibliography is probably the best part of it. I
<br>
must say I am a little disappointed by the book itself. Loren Cordain Ph.D
<br>
is in my opinion a brilliant scientist. I was very well acquainted with his
<br>
academic research papers about paleodiets prior to buying his book, and was
<br>
disappointed by the fact that his book is so rudimentary. I'm sure this is
<br>
because his publisher diluted his real thoughts to make them understandable
<br>
to John Q. Public in order to make his book more commercially successful. I
<br>
have exactly the same problem with the book by Dr. Gerald Reaven of Stanford
<br>
University. Dr. Reaven has done some incredible work in the field of
<br>
diabetes and Syndrome X. He's published dozens of revolutionary papers in a
<br>
major medical journals, but unfortunately his book is a joke.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One could as easily theorize poor plant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absorption if you eat dairy products.  
</em><br>
<p>Yep. A friend of mine on another health-related discussion list reminded me
<br>
of this just yesterday. In his words:
<br>
<p>&quot;One potentially &quot;bad&quot; thing not mentioned regarding bovine dairy is the 
<br>
ratio of calcium to phosphorous.  Human bones and therefore human dietary 
<br>
requirement is a ratio of 2:1 Calcium to Phosphorous.  Bovine milk is 2:1 
<br>
in favor of phosphorous.  Without supplemental calcium, most of the dairy 
<br>
intake of calcium is useless as it is excreted with the phosphorous in the 
<br>
body's attempt to strike the right balance.&quot;
