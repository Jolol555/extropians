There may be a serendipitous result of human-caused air pollution. That is, a 
<br>
reduction in the harmful impact of a greenhouse effect. Jerry Pournelle once 
<br>
speculated that perhaps all the pollution was holding a new Ice Age in 
<br>
abeyance, but that is not what the following article is claiming. Still, its 
<br>
along the same track as what Pournelle mused about.

<p>&lt;&lt;During the past few years, Chuang and colleagues including Joyce Penner 
<br>
(now at the University of Michigan), Keith Grant, Jane Dignon, Peter Connell, 
<br>
Daniel Bergman, and Douglas Rotman have used Livermore’s TeraCluster2000 
<br>
multiparallel supercomputer and the resources of the National Energy Research 
<br>
Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to model 
<br>
how anthropogenic aerosols affect global and regional climate. The researchers
<br>
’ simulations show in unprecedented detail how aerosols are partially 
<br>
offsetting the effect of global warming and changing the properties of 
<br>
clouds. In some industrial regions, the generation of aerosols from fossil 
<br>
fuel combustion and biomass (forest and grassland) burning may be as 
<br>
important to climate change as greenhouse gases. Also, climate changes caused 
<br>
by aerosols vary significantly by season and by region.
<br>
The research team belongs to the Atmospheric Chemistry and Aerosols Group, 
<br>
part of the Atmospheric Science Division of Livermore’s Energy and 
<br>
Environment Directorate. The team’s advanced simulations, whose findings have 
<br>
been corroborated by field measurements at different geographical locations, 
<br>
build on Livermore’s expertise in aerosols, climate, chemistry, and 
<br>
supercomputer simulations. The research has received funding from the 
<br>
Department of Energy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
<br>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Laboratory Directed 
<br>
Research and Development. The work also contributes to fulfilling the goals 
<br>
of the federal government’s National Aerosol Climate Interactions Program, an 
<br>
interagency effort created last year.
<br>
Chuang explains that aerosol concentrations from natural sources, such as 
<br>
volcanoes, sea spray, and desert dust storms, are believed to have remained 
<br>
generally steady over the past century. However, like greenhouse gases, 
<br>
anthropogenic aerosols have increased markedly since 1950. Based on satellite 
<br>
data, models, and information on urban and agricultural activities, 
<br>
scientists believe anthropogenic aerosols currently contribute about half of 
<br>
the total submicrometer-size aerosols in the atmosphere. Most of the 
<br>
anthropogenic aerosols are sulfates and carbonaceous compounds produced by 
<br>
the burning of fossil fuels and biomass....&gt;&gt;
