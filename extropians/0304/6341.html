<p>I'm completely lost as to what you're saying.  From all I've heard, foreigners
<br>
tend to not hate American people, just our foreign policy actions, which
<br>
considering we're supposed to be a democracy is arguably giving us more credit
<br>
than we deserve.  You'd seemed to be accusing them of being ungrateful for the
<br>
aid we give their gov't which they may or may not see.  What I gather is that
<br>
they see our gov't supporting their gov't as well as Israel, and have opinions
<br>
based on that.  Visiting Americans are another and friendlier thing.

<p><em>&gt; to the latest news reports, the Israel government is offering to remove

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&quot;Remove some settlements for peace&quot;, which we've heard before, while they
<br>
continue building a fence separating farmers from their lands.  Very
<br>
pessimistic, I'd say.
