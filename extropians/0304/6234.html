<p>
Those who know me off-list are aware that I'm no paragon of extropian
<br>
purity when it comes to my own personal fitness.  Slothful and
<br>
vice-ridden, I've often thought that if Max and Natasha were the
<br>
poster-couple for &quot;the extropian lifestyle,&quot; I must be the &quot;before&quot;
<br>
picture.  Well, among my other flaws, I'm vain, so recently I have had
<br>
to come face-to-face with the consequences of my bad habits.  Partly at
<br>
my urging, Max and Natasha got scuba certified last year and, now that
<br>
they've moved to Texas, we're about to go on our first dive trip
<br>
together in Mexico.  There's nothing more disgusting than a fat,
<br>
middle-aged bald guy in a wet suit.  Of these, the thing most under my
<br>
control is my weight, so a couple of months ago, when we decided on the
<br>
date for our dive trip, I decided I'd try to do something about my
<br>
physical condition.
<br>
<p>Six years ago or so, when I was about to turn 40, I went through another
<br>
&quot;crisis&quot; -- deciding that I would lose weight and try to get into shape.
<br>
And I did: On my 40th birthday I was in the best shape I'd been since I
<br>
was 25, with a flat stomach and at least a little muscle on my
<br>
otherwise-pear-shaped frame.  But I paid a price for the latter,
<br>
especially.  Going to the gym without guidance -- and pushed by vanity
<br>
and the looming four-oh -- I overdid the weight training.  I have
<br>
arthritis (how bad, I only learned later), and ended up hurting myself
<br>
in a number of ways.  By the time I was 41, many of my joints were
<br>
wrecked.  The chronic pain I found myself in worked as a steady
<br>
disincentive to exercise, and my trips to the gym ended up becoming less
<br>
and less frequent.  I got into a bad pattern: Infrequent workouts in
<br>
which I'd lift too much, hurting myself again, which kept me away from
<br>
the gym for longer and longer periods.  My professional work also became
<br>
more time-consuming so that, three or four years ago, I just stopped
<br>
going to the gym. Meanwhile, my poor eating habits kept putting the
<br>
pounds on.  By this last New Year, I was as weak as a kitten, still had
<br>
lots of joint pain and had gained 40 pounds.  All of this combined to
<br>
create a constant, nagging feeling of what I can only call self-loathing
<br>
that undermined my confidence on just about every level.
<br>
<p>Three things have changed and, as a result, I've experienced an amazing
<br>
turn-around.  First, the new class of &quot;Cox-2 inhibitor&quot;
<br>
anti-inflammatories are now on the market and my arthritis pain is all
<br>
but a thing of the past.  I couldn't take the old kind of
<br>
anti-inflammatories because they caused me intense nausea.  If, like me,
<br>
you've got joint and connective tissue problems and haven't tried the
<br>
new anti-inflammatories -- do it.  I take Vioxx every day now and am
<br>
essentially pain-free, a major and positive change in my life.
<br>
<p>Second, I got a very good coach to teach me how to exercise without
<br>
hurting myself and who has developed a workout regime for me that looks
<br>
sustainable.  The friend who took me under his wing is ten years older
<br>
than me, so he knows the challenges of middle-aged fitness (and also
<br>
happens to have been a former member of the Israeli national basketball
<br>
team, so he's a life-long athlete who really knows what he's doing).
<br>
The key has been to accept the limitations that age and my arthritis
<br>
impose on me and work around them.  I had to suck up my pride and accept
<br>
that during the first month or so I was lifting very little weight and
<br>
able to do only very limited duration sessions on aerobic exercise.  I
<br>
learned that the important thing is to tire my muscles without stressing
<br>
my joints, so we did a &quot;12-10-8-10&quot; regime, in which I did 12 reps with
<br>
very low weight then, after a short rest, did 10 reps of the same
<br>
exercise with a slightly increased weight, and so on.  This is a PERFECT
<br>
pattern for basically starting &quot;from scratch&quot; as I was and building some
<br>
basic muscle strength from almost nothing.  
<br>
<p>A second crucial lesson I've learned is that doing the exercises with
<br>
the proper form is essential to getting the exercise you need without
<br>
hurting yourself.  Back when I was doing things without guidance I was
<br>
jerking too much weight, stressing my back, neck, legs and elbows all
<br>
the time.  Now I've learned that you can isolate the muscle group you
<br>
want to exercise and keep stress off the parts of your body that can
<br>
easily be hurt.  I'm now lifting more than twice the weight I was when
<br>
we started two months ago, and have had NO joint pain at all -- NONE.
<br>
This is nothing short of miraculous to me and has been proof to me that
<br>
doing things RIGHT beats doing things with just EFFORT every time.
<br>
There are now many exercises I'm doing that I could not do AT ALL just
<br>
two months ago.  And all of this has been achieved with just TWO ONE
<br>
HOUR WORKOUTS PER WEEK.  I'm flat amazed and owe a deep debt of
<br>
gratitude to my friend who showed me this relatively simple formula.
<br>
<p>Finally, I've been on a fairly radical Atkins-type diet for six weeks
<br>
and, as of this morning have lost TWENTY POUNDS in that time.  Now I
<br>
know that there's still some controversy about the low-carb,
<br>
high-protein Atkins formula, but I don't feel like I've done any harm to
<br>
myself at all and the results are clear.  The first week or so was
<br>
pretty tough: I just LOVE sugary, carb-heavy sweets and my libertine's
<br>
personality is apt to over-indulge in such things all the time.  But
<br>
once I got through a period of withdrawal (during which I felt like
<br>
ripping someone's arm off every time I saw a cookie) -- this lasted
<br>
about a week, it became much easier and, being able to basically gorge
<br>
on protein as much as I liked -- which I have done without shame -- made
<br>
it easier.  Once your metabolism kicks into ketosis, fat starts to just
<br>
melt away.  This element of the diet is very important, since getting
<br>
visible results is an important psychological factor.  I can weigh
<br>
myself every day and almost every day see some impact.  A belt I'd just
<br>
about busted out of is now on its last notch -- in the good direction.
<br>
Suits I haven't been able to wear in three years are now part of my
<br>
wardrobe again -- if not exactly in the latest style.
<br>
<p>The combination of all these factors having dramatic results in a short
<br>
time is nothing short of astonishing to me: Being twice as strong, being
<br>
pain-free and carrying 10% less weight has made me feel like I've been
<br>
transformed into some kind of superman: I walk lighter and feel much
<br>
better. Even without the sugar and carbohydrates in my diet, I have more
<br>
energy as a result.  Given that many in our group have sedentary
<br>
&quot;brain-worker&quot; lifestyles and a survey of any EXTRO meeting reveals a
<br>
good deal of extra poundage and not enough lean muscle, I thought I'd
<br>
share this story.  If I can do it, anyone can.
