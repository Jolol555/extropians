</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also an UZI.  And you weigh 5 times what he does, and are 3 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times as tall.  And that's still underestimating the mis-match.
</em><br>
<p>How well you are armed is entirely irrelevant. Lets take your example.
<br>
The punk brandishes the knife and snarls at you. You brandish the UZI
<br>
and say &quot;Okay, punk, are you sure you want some of this? You'd better
<br>
turn that knife over, you might hurt somebody with it.&quot;
<br>
Instead, the idiot raises the knife and charges, screaming &quot;You have no
<br>
UZI, I am invicible, I will disembowel you to the gates of hell!!&quot;
<br>
Are you telling me that you would stand right there, no matter what you
<br>
are armed with, and just let the punk stab you? Hell no. You'll kneecap
<br>
him and take his knife away.

<em>&gt; During the middle-ages the great crime that the Christians charges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Muslims with was the burning of the Library at Alexandria.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't do it, but they were blamed anyway.  (It did happen while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were in charge, soon after the conquest of Alexandria.)  Now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bagdad's library wasn't as significant, but it wasn't minor.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially if Arabic is you native tongue.  Whatever our reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was, it's now worse.  That we didn't do it isn't going to cut much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ice.  We were in charge, and didn't do anything to stop it or put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the fire, or even collect the scraps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of parchment that flutter out on the flames.
</em><br>
<p>The Library of Alexandria has burned a number of times. It burned in
<br>
the time of the Ptolemies, during the Roman Empire, several times, most
<br>
notably around the time that the Hellenic philosopher/mathematician
<br>
Hypatia was flayed alive with abalone shells by a mob of Coptic
<br>
Christians (arabs all).
<br>
<p>Any time you mix dried and aging paper with oil or gas lanterns, you
<br>
are asking for a bonfire.
<br>
<p>The library also burned a couple times while under Muslim control, and
<br>
at least once under the torch of the Crusaders.
<br>
<p>It is so typically arab that all the looting of Iraq is being done by
<br>
Iraqis, and they have nothing to say for themselves except &quot;Why don't
<br>
you stop us from doing this to ourselves?&quot;
<br>
<p>Freedom is about personal responsibility. Now that Iraqis are free, it
<br>
is their responsibility to take responsibility for their own property
<br>
as well as their own actions.
