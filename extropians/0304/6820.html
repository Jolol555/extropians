<p>
My guess (and this is only a guess) is that protein is hard to digest.  It
<br>
is hard on the kidneys and it is hard on the body.  I believe that the
<br>
Atkins diet works because the body finds it easiest to burn carbs, then fats
<br>
are second, and protein last.  Eliminating carbs causes the body to start
<br>
burning fats.  Protein is only broken down and used by the body as a last
<br>
resort.  It wouldn't surprise me if cutting back protein (not to deficiency
<br>
levels) caused longevity.  Eating more proteins than necessary puts an extra
<br>
burden on the body without any added benefit.
<br>
<p>I will even go further and state that I am deliberately avoiding trying to
<br>
gain muscle mass or bulking up on a heavy weight lifting regime.  I think
<br>
this pushes the metabolism into high gear, increases the appetite and
<br>
associated oxidative damage, and is very hard on the body because it
<br>
constantly builds up and tears down muscle.  Pushing a faster metabolism
<br>
produces short-term results, but ages the body faster.  It increases cell
<br>
replication, pushes against the Hayflick limit faster, wears out bones
<br>
faster, increases replication errors and potential cancers and cumulative
<br>
injuries.  I consider such heavy programs to be the opposite of calorie
<br>
restriction, and in this case, the opposite of protein restriction.
<br>
<p>All foods and digestion is hard on the body.  Everything has its drawbacks
<br>
and should be used in moderation.  That is why many fad diets work.  You can
<br>
pick almost anything to cut out of your diet and find wonderful health
<br>
benefits by avoiding too much of it.  The problem is that we can't avoid
<br>
everything.  Fasting may be the healthiest thing for the body until you
<br>
starve to death.  Calorie restriction may be the healthiest diet until you
<br>
cut back too far.  Instead of radical elimination of a single
<br>
macro-nutrient, I prefer moderate levels of carbs, fats and proteins,
<br>
choosing the healthiest versions of each and avoiding the unhealthy versions
<br>
of each.  This seems more reasonable in all areas and less radical or
<br>
experimental in any one particular area.
