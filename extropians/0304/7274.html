<p>
Thought i would add another diet, or rather, less of a diet, and more of a
<br>
common sense eating rules. Dr. Bob Arnot, who i think was actually
<br>
broadcasting from Iraq recently, is actually a medical correspondent. He
<br>
wrote 2 books I have read, both good. In particular his diet book really
<br>
helped me ~4 years ago and ever since.
<br>
<p>In particular, he does not really advocate any radical answers, he just sort
<br>
of puts together some common sense things that our grandparents probably
<br>
knew, but that Marketing people and science journalists, have unprogrammed.
<br>
<p>Control your blood sugar level, keep it pretty level by NOT eating many
<br>
carbs like bread, pasta, rice, potatoes etc. Do eat legumes like beans (but
<br>
not too quickly or flatulence!). Lots of fiber, especially soluble fiber.
<br>
Eating the way they eat in some third world countries is good, processed
<br>
food is bad. Unprocessed food is harder in general, you chew it longer, it
<br>
fills you up more, it digests slower, staying in your digestive tract
<br>
longer. Since it digests slowly, it does not make you blood sugar spike, and
<br>
therefore your insulin does not kick in, so you feel energetis all the time.
<br>
<p>The beauty is that this is very do-able. It does not require really unique
<br>
foods or crazy diets that make you crave things and feel hungry or weird. It
<br>
is mostly common sense, once you read it, you understand why Americans are
<br>
so obese, everything is processed and carbo loaded. I need to re read it
<br>
again as I have forgot some of the things he says, but every time I eat, I
<br>
try to make small adjustments. I add a little oat bran to cereals, I get
<br>
cereals with fiber or add oat bran to them. I am not afraid of meat, in fact
<br>
i love meat, and some fat too. These are not too bad. I eat more vegetables
<br>
all the time. I add soybeans to my soups or other things. I have many frozen
<br>
vegetables, which are very healthy as they are often frozen in the field,
<br>
that I add to many things I cook.
<br>
<p>The only downside, and I alluded to it iearlier is beans. They are an
<br>
important aspect of this diet. I turned my friend on to this book a few
<br>
years ago. She read it, and ate a buncha beans everyday for a couple days
<br>
then went on a 3 day yoga retreat. When she came back on Monday i saw her
<br>
and she passed gas. BAD gas - noxious fumes for sure. evil. worst in the
<br>
world. She said all weekend she was passing gas in yoga poses. Silent
<br>
killers. It must have been brutal. I imagine being all relaxed and streched
<br>
out and smelling those bombs. She has stinky gas for a couple months but in
<br>
general it has gotten much better as she has bred the bacteria to digest
<br>
that. There is also beano, a gas stopper you can take with meals if that is
<br>
a problem. I laugh to myself all the time over that one.
<br>
<p>I think news media and science is to blame for much of this. My grandparents
<br>
lived to 90+ years, they ate gruel, and knew it was good. Scientists said
<br>
pasta is good for a runners diet, journalists publicized this. Everybody
<br>
started eating pasta. Pasta does not exist in nautre! But anyways, that is
<br>
another story.
<br>
<p>Another good book, by the way is Dr. Dean Edell's book Eat Drink and be
<br>
Merry. He also advocates moderation and such. Dr. Dean should run for
<br>
president, he has  a radio show that is very good and pragmatic.
<br>
<p>I cannot say much about the Atkins diet, except i like meat and fat, it
<br>
sates me for long periods of time. But i think too much meat is bad, we have
<br>
flat molars designed for hard grains. And sharp teeth for ripping meat. But
<br>
we do not have a little hole for spagetti!
