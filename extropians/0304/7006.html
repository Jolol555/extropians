<p><em>&gt; nuclear genes, usually present in only two copies, achieve large protein

</em><br>
<p>This may be true -- though I'd like to see some data on what
<br>
regulates the mRNA degradation in eukaryotes.  I'm reasonably
<br>
certain that in bacteria (prokaryote) mRNAs are recycled fairly
<br>
rapidly so they can change state more quickly than eukaryotes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you transfer the mtDNA to the nucleus and set the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear-encoded mtRNA polycistronic transcript to a high copy number (by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stabilizing it in the cytoplasm), you should be able to make the same amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of protein as made from the 10,000 mtDNAs currently present in our cells.
</em><br>
<p>Here I'm not so sure -- any context I've seen polycistronic mRNAs
<br>
discussed it is always in prokaryotes.  I don't think I've ever
<br>
encountered polycistronic eukaryotic mRNAs.  But one can get the
<br>
same effect with multiple gene copies as is the case with the
<br>
ribosomal (rDNA) or transfer (tDNA) genes (which produce (rRNA &amp; tRNA).
<br>
That is common in the larger eukaryotic genomes.
<br>
<p>Polycistronic for those who don't know means that RNA polymerase
<br>
transcribes a single messenger RNA (mRNA) with multiple genes on
<br>
the same RNA strand.  It is useful for sets of genes one wants
<br>
to operate in conjunction with each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know if there is an increase in the mutation rate at highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcriptionally active loci (where the sense DNA strand indeed has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pulled open for the RNA to be synthesized), but this couldn't be a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutation rate than what you have in the mtDNA now, with all mitos actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recycling their DNA about every two weeks
</em><br>
<p>At normal body temperatures, if you have two single-strand breaks on
<br>
opposing strands (due to intermediate stages of DNA repair processes
<br>
derived from various types of DNA damage) in a DNA strand at separations
<br>
from 8 to 18 base pairs (depending on the GC:AT composition) then the
<br>
DNA will &quot;melt&quot; producing a double strand break.  At fever temperatures
<br>
the separation distance increases slightly.  During transcription
<br>
I believe RNA polymerase effectively melts DNA over a larger distance
<br>
still (dozens of base pairs?) so one could get a double strand break
<br>
from single strand breaks located at even larger distances.
<br>
<p>So I would say that yes -- highly transcriptionally active loci would
<br>
be more likely to accumulate mutations since they are more likely
<br>
to incur double strand breaks which produce sequence corruptions
<br>
if they are repaired by the non-homologus end-joining (NHEJ) DNA
<br>
repair pathway.
<br>
<p>[Side note -- this conversation has been quite useful with respect
<br>
to my ideas on a &quot;Grand Unified Theory of Aging&quot;.]
<br>
<p>I agree with Rafal that the nuclear mutation rates should be lower
<br>
than the mitochondrial mutation rates.  I would expect there ought
<br>
to be data in PubMed on this.
<br>
<p>Robert
