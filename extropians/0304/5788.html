<p><em>&gt;&gt;SPACESHIP TRAVEL TO ANOTHER UNIVERSE THROUGH A BLACK HOLE may be highly 
</em><br>
improbable, but it cannot be ruled out, according to a new analysis that 
<br>
explores the idea of &quot;hybrid singularity.&quot; As science fiction fans know, 
<br>
anyone who wishes to fall into a black hole and re-emerge at some distant 
<br>
location or even an another universe would have to go through a forbidding 
<br>
region inside the black hole known as a &quot;space-time singularity.&quot; 
<br>
Traditionally this means negotiating a region of infinite density exerting 
<br>
destructive, tide-like distortions on any &quot;extended object&quot; such as a 
<br>
spaceship, molecule, or anything that is not truly point-like. Physicists now 
<br>
suspect this picture is incomplete and that a second and potentially milder 
<br>
type of singularity might exist. Known as a &quot;Cauchy horizon singularity,&quot; it 
<br>
would impart only finite tidal distortions on extended objects. The kinder, 
<br>
gentler singularity should only develop when a regular stream of matter or 
<br>
energy falls into the hole. Previous analyses have considered only streams 
<br>
that were brief bursts. But long-duration &quot;non-compact&quot; streams of radiation, 
<br>
like the cosmic microwave background, can also fall into the black hole. In a 
<br>
more comprehensive analysis that takes these &quot;non-compact&quot; sources into 
<br>
account, Lior Burko of the University of Utah (<a href="mailto:burko@physics.utah.edu?Subject=Re:%20Travel%20Through%20Black%20Holes">burko@physics.utah.edu</a>) 
<br>
explores how a black hole's interior is affected by such infalling radiation. 
<br>
If the non-compact sources are weak, Burko shows, a hybrid singularity forms: 
<br>
a strong sector (inevitably destructive) and a weak sector (finite tidal 
<br>
distortions). Conceivably, a spaceship entering through the weak sector could 
<br>
travel unscathed to another part of space-time. If the perturbations due to 
<br>
non-compact sources are large, however, Burko shows that the singularity ends 
<br>
up being strong, and destructive, everywhere in the black hole. Whether black 
<br>
hole singularities in our universe are strong-only or hybrid in nature 
<br>
depends on incompletely known cosmological parameters (such as the expansion 
<br>
rate of the universe and the nature of dark energy). Several factors may 
<br>
ultimately rule out the possibility of hyperspace travel. They include: (1) 
<br>
the possibility that &quot;weak&quot; sectors may still be much too hazardous for 
<br>
travel; (2) overwhelming effects on the black hole from actual non-compact 
<br>
sources and (3) a working theory of quantum gravity, which may reveal other 
<br>
factors that rule out hyperspace travel. But for now, Burko says, the 
<br>
possibilities are open. (Burko, Physical Review Letters, 28 March 2003) &lt;&lt;
