<p>People aren't concerned about hundreds or thousands of years notice.  They're
<br>
concerned about decades notice.  Or sea levels rising now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; something else Im not seeing?  Is there concern about

</em><br>

<p>Yes, concern about wild species.  The existence of warm-adapted species
<br>
doesn't change the extinction of cooler species, or local disruptions.
<br>
Species don't necessarily move that fast, and the warm-adapted ones can be in
<br>
trouble if the climate changes in other ways (rainfall.)
<br>
<p>There's fear about malaria spreading.  There's fear about drought in the
<br>
breadbaskets of the world.  There's fear about shutting off the Gulf Stream
<br>
<p>Above all there's fear not just of change to a system we've adapted fairly
<br>
well to but of unprecedentedly fast change.  (And even if it's utterly
<br>
unprecedented, do we want to live through such a disruption if we can avoid
<br>
it?)
<br>
<p>The way I put it is: we're burning all the CO2 sequestered in the
<br>
Carboniferous.  Do you want to live in the Carboniferous?  Do you want
<br>
tropical conditions everywhere?  I sure don't.  And the sun's output is higher
<br>
now than it was then, too.
<br>
<p>Oh, there's also fear of a runaway greenhouse effect and turning into Venus.
<br>
The fear may or may not be misfounded, but it's a fear some people have.
<br>
<p>Dismiss the people who have these fears as paranoid fools (or Lee's people
<br>
conspiring to destroy capitalism), and they'll just dismiss you as
<br>
short-sightedly blind fools who don't want to face unpleasant facts,
<br>
especially if those shake your market faith.
