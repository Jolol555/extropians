<p><em>&gt; (Harvey or gts or someone may want to confirm this).
</em><br>
<p>I haven't time to follow this thread closely (I'm
<br>
breaking many social graces even to be online at all
<br>
during this Easter weekend during which I am not at my
<br>
own home) but I see above that I have been mentioned,
<br>
so I thought I should scratch up a quick reply.
<br>
<p>I scanned the messages here thus far and I'm a little
<br>
confused. The original message by Reason pointed to an
<br>
article at www.longevitymeme.org, which pointed in
<br>
turn to an article at LEF, which comes from
<br>
NewsRx.com. That article is about the possible
<br>
life-extension benefits of restricting one or more of
<br>
three specific amino acids. The title of the LEF
<br>
article itself is &quot;A methionine restricted diet may
<br>
cause prolongation of life.&quot; The two other amino acids
<br>
mentioned as AA-restriction candidates are cysteine
<br>
and tryptophan.
<br>
<p>Am I looking at the right article? Perhaps not.
<br>
However if I am looking at the right article then why
<br>
is no one here discussing the properties of
<br>
methionine, cysteine or tryptophan? 
<br>
<p>I have often argued (not here at ExI, but rather on
<br>
other discussion lists devoted entirely to health and
<br>
longevity, some which I manage or moderate) that any
<br>
amino acid (AA) considered individually should be
<br>
considered as something near to a pharmaceutical drug.
<br>
The FDA made a similar argument in its attempt some
<br>
years ago to regulate them, and while I oppose the 
<br>
regulation of AA's I don't think the FDA was too far
<br>
off the mark in its arguments. I am inclined to give
<br>
some validity to the FDA's argument because the body
<br>
expects to receive AA's as part of complete protein
<br>
molecules in the company of other AA's and because
<br>
each AA has unique activities in the body. It's a bit
<br>
of a stretch to say that individual AA's are &quot;natural
<br>
foods,&quot; given that no animal can consume individual
<br>
AA's in a natural diet. It follows also then that a
<br>
major restriction in the diet of a single AA might
<br>
also have near-drug-like effects, and that the
<br>
individual properties of the restricted AA could be
<br>
very important. 
<br>
<p>But I see discussion here only about the general
<br>
restriction of amino acids -- nothing about what might
<br>
happen if we restrict one or more of the specific AA's
<br>
mentioned in the LEF article. (Again, am I looking at
<br>
the wrong article?)
<br>
<p>Concerning the three AA's mentioned:
<br>
<p>Cysteine can act as a neurotoxin (&quot;excitotoxin&quot; to be
<br>
more precise), at least when present in large
<br>
quantities. This raises the possibility that
<br>
restricting cysteine might help to preserve the
<br>
nervous system and thus help to extend life-span. 
<br>
<p>Methionine is one of only a few sulphur containing
<br>
AA's. Perhaps restricting intake of sulphur-containing
<br>
AA's has relevance to life-extension. 
<br>
<p>Tryptophan is a precursor to 5-HTP, which is in turn a
<br>
precursor to serotonin in the brain. It tends to be a
<br>
mild sleep-agent and can help fight depression. Some
<br>
studies show that depletion of tryptophan can trigger
<br>
psychological depression, and perhaps this type of
<br>
depression also works in physical ways similar to
<br>
calorie restriction. 
<br>
<p>These are only thoughts off the top of my head, but
<br>
they are the kinds of ideas I would be investigating
<br>
more closely if I had time right now to investigate
<br>
this subject in detail. 
<br>
<p>Hope this helps.
