<p><em>&gt; There's a very obvious third argument, which is that a

</em><br>
<p>Not really, in my view.
<br>
<p>This goes to a problem with meanings that I think has stymied my
<br>
communications with several people here in these diet threads. Unless we are
<br>
including unnatural supplements and medicines in the definition of diet, it
<br>
is in my view a logical and scientific mistake to make a distinction between
<br>
the terms &quot;optimally healthy diet&quot; and &quot;diet to which one is best adapted.&quot;
<br>
To me these terms are synonymous. The optimally healthy diet, whatever it
<br>
might be, is *defined* as the diet to which one is best adapted. 
<br>
<p>Similarly, nutrient-rich foods are not good for us for the reason that
<br>
nutrition scientists tell us so. Rather, nutrition scientists tell us they
<br>
are good for us for the reason that they have discovered them to be the
<br>
foods to which are best adapted. Scientists don't dictate nature. They
<br>
discover it.
<br>
<p>And there is still much remaining to be discovered by nutrition science. I
<br>
don't presume to know more than mother nature. This is why I look first to
<br>
evolution science to guide my diet, and why I demand solid scientific proof
<br>
to justify any deviations from the diet upon which my species evolved.
