There are a few other science fiction books we often talk about here.
<br>
One is Marooned in Realtime, Vernor Vinge's novel that most clearly
<br>
discusses his concept of the Singularity and gives something of a feeling
<br>
of what it might have been like.  Other Vinge novels include A Fire
<br>
Upon the Deep, fantastically imaginative, and A Deepness in the Sky,
<br>
set in the same universe.  I'm also looking forward to his next novel,
<br>
which will supposedly be an expanded version of his short story Fast Times
<br>
at Fairmont High, a near-future setting with lots of neat technology.
<br>
<p>Another series we often reference is the one Mike Lorrey mentioned,
<br>
Iain M. Banks' novels of the Culture.  Unfortunately these stories never
<br>
stick with me so I can't remember what happens in most of the books.
<br>
<p>Greg Egan has written a couple of novels we talk about.  Diaspora has
<br>
lots of wild ideas, showing an interaction between a recognizable
<br>
human culture and humans who have converted themselves into super-fast
<br>
AI brains living in an abstract virtual reality, then segueing into an
<br>
exploration of a 5 dimensional universe.  His earlier novel, Permutation
<br>
City, also explored some unique ideas about virtual living.
<br>
<p>I recently enjoyed The Golden Age, by John C. Wright, which is just out
<br>
in paperback in the past couple of weeks.  It shows a diverse future
<br>
community with humans normal and enhanced, plus super-intelligent AIs,
<br>
all in a hard-core libertarian society.  The sequel is supposed to come
<br>
out next month.
<br>
<p>You might also take a look at <a href="http://www.extropy.org/shop/index.html">http://www.extropy.org/shop/index.html</a>
<br>
which has these and some other fiction books listed.  If you buy through
<br>
those links you benefit the Extropy Institute.
