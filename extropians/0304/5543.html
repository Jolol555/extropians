</em><br>
<p>Ironically, I have filtered out Ron's posts for some time.  So 
<br>
without Greg's response there would have been zero chance of my 
<br>
answering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Ron, mine, the Mikes, and many other posters determination to fully have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the record of the United States analyzed and the positive (and negative)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we happen to be Americans.
</em><br>
<p>Such a least is not terribly relevant to whether this particular 
<br>
war is just or not. Which was the very subject I was speaking 
<br>
about.  It is not important to me right now to go off in some 
<br>
sidetrack of persuading some people that I fully appreciate all 
<br>
the good things they appreciate about this country.  I have 
<br>
nothing I need to prove there in order to speak on subject.  In 
<br>
point of fact I have a very fine appreciation of the really good 
<br>
aspects of this country and its intended (although not very well 
<br>
practiced) form of government.  I have a deep appreciaiton of 
<br>
how much is working here as well as a great deal of frustration 
<br>
with how much is needlessly and dangerously broken.  But again, 
<br>
this is a sidetrack from the subject at hand which is whether 
<br>
this war is justified.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Not acknowledging what has been done in the world to free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people from oppression, tyranny, and intolerance because of arbitrary deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ingrained disdain based on what some might consider half truths and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misconceptions is unacceptable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If our current actions are about nothing of the kind except in 
<br>
rhetoric then such an exposition is irrelevant to judging said 
<br>
actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     If we do not follow from lessons learned that proved positive, we can have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no chance of progressing into the future and end up stumbling blindly into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Generally, yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   That some people have absolutely nothing positive to say of the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States is deplorable.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  But this is not the point right now.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedoms that each and every human enjoys on this
<br>
<em>&gt; planet (those fortunate enough to enjoy some) can all be attributed to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree to the United States. Yet some insist that merely because the US (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other country) is powerful and in a dominant world position, than it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad,  or &quot;might makes wrong&quot;, in huMania's words. This position too is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable in any form to many on this list, and the record of the United 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States as compared to other major world powers, most notably the Soviet Union 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Nazi Germany, is a necessary part of illustrating why the position of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;might makes wrong&quot; is not appropriate in all cases.
</em><br>
<p>You are over-simplifying the real objection.  Which is the 
<br>
public text, speech and actions that we intend to use our might, 
<br>
right or wrong, to remold the world to our liking whether or not 
<br>
that is what is best for or desired by the people of the 
<br>
countries to be molded.  There is nothing democratic or free 
<br>
about changing people's home country to what you might prefer 
<br>
regardless of their own wishes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I will say again that I feel in some cases Greg's objections are legitimate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since I do not consider (and have repeatedly said on this forum) that all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign policy decisions made by the United States have been the correct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones. But regarding  the question repeatedly posed to Samantha and others, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his objections are totally off the mark. The most important reason for this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that Samantha has never adequately answered that question in the many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times Matus, Ron, I or anyone else have asked it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Because it is utterly irrelevant to the question at hand and I 
<br>
have much better things to do than jump through arbitrary hoops.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Illustrating that the United States helped foster and make possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy in Taiwan, Greece, South Korea, Japan, etc. is not &quot;holding up a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogan&quot;,  nor blind 'americanism'  it is illustrating facts that cannot be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously debated, in addition to pointing out that the United States foreign 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy is not the empty and bankrupt vessel some claim it is, ESPECIALLY when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is compared to other major world powers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Samantha's  positions are totally predicated on a belief that the US has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistently supported dictators at the expense of democracy abroad.
</em><br>
<p>This is absolutely false.  Retract it immediately.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; She has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never satisfactorily explained where all these democracies would have come 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from, or why hosts of democratic experiments failed in the third world of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; '50s, '60s, and 70s, without the slightest hint of Cold War geopolitical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence, and why not one Soviet proxy became a democracy while it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated by the USSR, while a great many proxies of the United States did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed develop lasting and stable democracies. It is completely legitimate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Ron to ask that she back up what many would consider a flawed position 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with more than &quot;the history is out there.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, I am not going to punch your pet tarbaby.
