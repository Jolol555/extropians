Talking and writing about visceral - here I mean anatomic truths - reactions
<br>
to the US war lords appears to be a violation of good taste to some people
<br>
who cold-bloodedly accept suffering and death on both sides. To me it is
<br>
clearly this behaviour, this indignation about dirty words that shows the
<br>
whole perversion. Puking - dirty, dirty! - is suddenly labeled as bad taste
<br>
and the lowest level of communication. Maybe it is really a cultural gap
<br>
between the US and Europe, but I grew up with literature and art that
<br>
deliberately and elaborately gets to visceral - this time of course
<br>
physically *and* metaphorically - descriptions that offer blatant images.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>&quot;U.S. warlords&quot; you say?  From my point of view the term is &quot;U.S. military defenders of human rights.&quot;  Hubert, try to think of all the people who will be saved every year from torture, murder and rape (a form of torture) when the U.S. and British forces overthrow Saddam's sadistic regime.  
<br>
<p>Very sadly, sometimes for a time humanity must endure suffering and death to stop a far greater evil.  This is what is going on now.  To want to stop all wars of this nature would be a horrible disservice to oppressed and violated people everywhere.  It is not being cold-blooded, but simply being realistic in the sense that at times a high price must be paid to cut a cancer out of the human body politic.
<br>
<p>he continues:
<br>
Okay, all I ask for, Greg, is: please do not establish the scissors of self
<br>
censorship in our brains. I will gladly label my postings as contributions
<br>
that will not attack *members of  this list* because of their pro war
<br>
feeling but mails that might contain rude and dirty words in the eyes and
<br>
ears of those who are pro war. All people have to do is put my name
<br>
in their kill files or delete my postings.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I do totally agree with you regarding censorship.  I think just properly labeling a post should be enough.  Oh, by the way, don't call me &quot;pro war&quot;, instead call me &quot;pro justice&quot; because the Iraqi people in time will be among the big winners here.
<br>
<p>It will simply to take time for you and others to see the rightness of this cause.  Then again, even when Iraq is a beacon of democracy in a region full of tyrannies you will probably find reasons to quibble.
