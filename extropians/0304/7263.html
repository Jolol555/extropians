Hmm, that implies that there are patterns of arbitrary size to 
<br>
have knowledge about. If you have a finite past lightcone (= the 
<br>
things you can know about) then the amount of knowledge is bounded 
<br>
(but increasing).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It would be wondrous indeed, if it was theoretically possible to revover, 
<br>
even a large part of the data from a light cone!
<br>

<br>
Shipping the bit requires energy to accelerate it, 
<br>
and if you want it to go interstellar distances fast that means 
<br>
energy on the order of the rest mass. So it is easier to put 
<br>
information into matter locally than transmit it elsewhere. Which 
<br>
bodes ill for the interlibrary loans of the postsingularity world. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I wonder if at some point, centuries from now, X crosses Y and advances in 
<br>
computing, that we see today, have run aground on Moore's Law, and humanity 
<br>
or what we have evolved into, views fast transportation, as the way forward? 
<br>
It may be then that the attraction of the great emptiness, called the 
<br>
Universe becomes more tempting, rather then daunting. The future of the sun 
<br>
and the solar system becomes disconcerting to our descendants; and they start 
<br>
getting the survival meme of migration for safety. The economics of such an 
<br>
attempt may also coincide with advances in space tech, since economics is in 
<br>
fact, not the science of scarcity of goods and services, but the perception 
<br>
of such a scarcity. Once freed from the perception that space travel is 
<br>
expensive, or that the return is not worth the expense, post humanity might 
<br>
then take wings, of an interstellar variety.
