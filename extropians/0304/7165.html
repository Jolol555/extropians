<p>The late Dr. Atkins, who passed away just about week ago, recommended that
<br>
people on the &quot;maintenance&quot; version of his diet eat some carb, approx 50-100
<br>
grams per day, enough to stay just at or slightly above the level of
<br>
ketosis. 
<br>
<p>I don't recall anything in Atkins' theory that addresses the question of
<br>
when weight loss should stop. I think his theory allows for differences in
<br>
metabolism between individuals, and suggests that one should add a little
<br>
more carb if weight drops too low. However I can relate my own experience:
<br>
as I mentioned early in this thread I followed Atkins' recommendations for
<br>
nearly two years. In my case the weight loss seemed to stop or slow
<br>
dramatically, but only after I had lost an unreasonable amount of weight. I
<br>
was at least 15-25 lbs below my ideal weight when I decided finally to
<br>
switch to a paleodiet more rich in carbs from fruits and vegetables. 
<br>
<p>One of the side-effects of ketosis is loss of appetite. This, I think, is
<br>
one of the primary reasons that some people including me can lose so much
<br>
weight on ketogenic Atkins-style diets. I know that in my case my appetite
<br>
diminished dramatically. 
<br>
<p>The Atkins diet turns into a good approximation of the paleodiet when one
<br>
eliminates the fatty dairy products and adds plenty of healthy paleolithic
<br>
fruits and vegetables. The fruits seems like candy to me at the time.
<br>
<p>I no longer believe the Atkins' diet is optimal. I believe in fact that it
<br>
is unhealthy. On the other hand I do believe that for many people it is a
<br>
step in the right direction vs the typical high-fat, high-carb American
<br>
diet.
