Damien opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;From all I've heard, foreigners
<br>
tend to not hate American people, just our foreign policy actions, which
<br>
considering we're supposed to be a democracy is arguably giving us more 
<br>
credit
<br>
than we deserve. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Buzz! Sorry wrong answer. If you really buy into the notion that &quot;we hate 
<br>
your government, not you!&quot; then you may have been nodding off over the last 
<br>
year and a half. Hating a government doesn't apply when it people that are 
<br>
attacked. And yes, this is consistant when you consider that governments 
<br>
aren't imported from Mars, they are always recruited from the populace. So 
<br>
let us both be consistant that when we attack a government, we are also 
<br>
attacking a people. Otherwise, there would be no civilian body count or 
<br>
colateral damage. Chirac has said it, as well as that German fellow on the 
<br>
list. You may buy into that claim, but I do not. Me bad.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&quot;Remove some settlements for peace&quot;, which we've heard before, while they
<br>
continue building a fence separating farmers from their lands.  Very
<br>
pessimistic, I'd say.
<br>
<p>-xx- Damien X-) &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, sometimes good fences make for better neighbors, or at least less 
<br>
violent encounters, if one removes the likelihood of encounters. For a 
<br>
real-world example, look to the Nato enforcement of ethnically cleansed 
<br>
regions of the Balkans. Why is there no massacres happening like there was, 
<br>
why did the Serbs depose Milosevic? 
<br>
<p>In part because peoples who hate each other are physically separated. No 
<br>
suicide bombers getting in, means no deaths, unless they are recruited from 
<br>
Arab towns in Israel, which has been and is being attempted by Hamas, and the 
<br>
PA's Al Quds division. If such farmers, as you noted, have already sent their 
<br>
son's in as Shaheed, who will receive 72 virgins etc., then spearation seems 
<br>
necessary, because nothing else would work.
