</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Terry Colvin posted MRC's report card on media coverage of the war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right on this list. Fox scored best with a B+. ABC had a D+.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Media Research Center is not a neutral source.  It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group established specifically for, in their own words, &quot;Documenting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exposing and Neutralizing Liberal Media Bias.&quot;  They are against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective news reporting, and praised FOX news for &quot;rejecting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard liberal idea that objective war news requires an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indifference to whether America succeeds or fails.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Read that last line again!  They reject the idea that objectivity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires the news reporter to be indifferent to the story being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reported.
</em><br>
<p>Actually what you said and they said are two entirely different things,
<br>
but generally get conflated by lefties.
<br>
<p>A reporters job is to report the facts. It is not to present all sides
<br>
or opinions of an issue as equally valid. If the facts demonstrate that
<br>
one side or opinion is stupid, wrong, ludicrous, foolish, false,
<br>
fraudulent, etc. it may be left to the consumer to reach that
<br>
conclusion or a reporter may engage in analysis if it is labeled as
<br>
such.
<br>
<p>Lefties in the media think that objectivity demands that they always
<br>
present the anti-American view as more valid than the pro-American
<br>
view. That they present anti-American propaganda as factual reportage
<br>
and pro-American as inherently flawed, biased, and subject to criticism
<br>
and mockery.
<br>
<p>We now know that left wing media like CNN deliberately skewed their
<br>
reportage in exchange for access. We also now know that mideastern
<br>
media outlets were paid cash by Saddam for positive spin. While Fox was
<br>
reporting accurately the American advance into Bagdad, less than 1/4
<br>
mile from the Information Ministry, al Jazeera TV was reporting the
<br>
claims of the Info Minister as fact.
<br>
<p>We see that self confessed liberal cheerleaders in the network media
<br>
like Peter Jennings and Dan Rather were reporting falsehoods
<br>
specifically because they put more credence in biased foreign sources
<br>
than in embedded American sources. They repeatedly presented a picture
<br>
of Iraqi liberation as more difficult than it was, with more opposition
<br>
than there was, and with more resistance from civilians than there was.
<br>
They continue to refuse to cover the high degree of civilian support
<br>
for American liberators that continues to this day, so much so that
<br>
locals involved in the formation of a new government are more
<br>
pro-American than Iraqi exiles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They deliberately choose the news that they want to report based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on how it makes America appear.  They praise FOX for &quot;correctly&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (their words) portraying U.S. military efforts as successful, while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blasting ABC when it &quot;indulged anti-war protesters with free war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>ABC went further than that, it claimed that the protesters represented
<br>
the majority grassroots sentiment in the US, when reality was the exact
<br>
opposite. They claimed that protests attracted more protesters than
<br>
there actually were, and they reported all violent clashes with police
<br>
as caused by law enforcement, when the fact is that the same
<br>
provocateurs in the anarchist movement we've been documenting here in
<br>
the luddite movement were also involved in assaulting police from
<br>
behind march lines..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their grading system is directly proportional to how well a news 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agencies sticks to the party line and refrains from presenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissenting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoints.  This kind of government-controlled media scares me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no matter whose favorite political party is in power.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't aware that MRC or FOX were government controlled in any way.
