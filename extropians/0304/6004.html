Steve Davies writes
<br>
<p>What the record shows
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that climate change is good news for some, bad for others. So the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Medieval Climate Optimum was pretty good if you were a Viking but
</em><br>
disastrous
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for Dutchmen as it led to the huge flood in the 12th century that
</em><br>
drowned
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; two thirds of the low countries and created the Zuyder Zee (much of
</em><br>
which is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still there).
</em><br>
<p>Lee asks
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How quickly did the inundation occur?  I'm wondering if it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be quite easy for the Dutch today to prevent something similar.
</em><br>
<p>It happened overnight (in 1153 if my memory is correct) as the result of a
<br>
huge storm that smashed though the existing coastline. The Dutch today
<br>
obviously have more tricks up their sleeve but you need to realise rising
<br>
sealevel isn't the acute problem. It's rather the threat of much more
<br>
frequent extreme weather events (100 year storms) which can cause massive
<br>
floods, especially if combined with something like a high tide, backing up
<br>
of the Rhine and Maas. Sure they can defend against such a risk but at very
<br>
high capital cost.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not a lot anyone can do to prevent this though. Florida real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; estate doesn't look like a good bet to me if you look back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just 80 years to the weather it experienced in the 1920s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when it had a series of huge hurricanes.  Not so many condos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and hotels back then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, why not ;-)  Just get the government to declare it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disaster area, and the owners don't really run any risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Putting aside hurricanes for a moment, and assuming that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Florida gets privately owned, then could the rise in sea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level be so slow as to permit owners to build walls to hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back the sea?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Of course, but as I said the problem isn't rising sea levels, at least not
<br>
in Florida (it would be in the Maldives) but the increased probability of
<br>
major hurricanes. So I think there will be a political move to give special
<br>
protection to Florida property owners. With Florida being such an important
<br>
state politically it might just happen:)
