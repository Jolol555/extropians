</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, there is *that* particular kind of unfairness
<br>
(dying early).  But &quot;getting your money back later, with
<br>
profit!&quot; is the key characteristic of any pyramid scheme,
<br>
and it does work, except for those who are still owed 
<br>
when the whole thing crashes.
<br>
<p>But let's suppose that (a) people don't die early, and (b) 
<br>
one particular Western country (e.g. the U.S.) never crashes.
<br>
In this case, can we really say that the pyramid scheme
<br>
enriched anyone?
<br>
<p>I doubt it.  Here is a semi-proof:  suppose that the scheme
<br>
by which government seizes the money of the young and 
<br>
immediately transfers it to the old appears in dollar terms
<br>
to pay the old more than it cost them in turn when they were
<br>
young.
<br>
<p>If this assumption is true, then it means that (1) the money
<br>
properly invested would yield less, and (2) society is better-
<br>
off in the forced transfer of resources, despite the weakening
<br>
of incentives for both younger and older people.
<br>
<p>I find both assumptions unlikely.  The first is unlikely 
<br>
because it discourages savings and investment, and has the
<br>
same drawbacks that usually attend artificial distortions
<br>
of the natural economy that governments are so fond of.
<br>
It also discourages the cultivation of prudence in a society.
<br>
<p>The second is also telling, IMO.  Older people who are very
<br>
possibly still able to contribute to an economy are &quot;paid off&quot;
<br>
not to work, and younger people, known for their short time
<br>
horizons, see less reward for their labor.  (This really becomes
<br>
a strong factor when it finally requires more and more workers
<br>
per retiree to keep the scheme going.)
