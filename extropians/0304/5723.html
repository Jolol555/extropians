<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin claims of teleportation:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;if someone had ten experiences of that, I'm sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;he or she would come around to agreeing with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a really rotten basis for deciding whether something is the case or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.  If Lee had ten experiences of whatever Samantha goes through during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her mystical union with the divine, he might well be convinced that he'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been in contact with deity.  He'd be wrong, almost certainly, but hey. 
</em><br>
<p>Very good point.  I have overestimated the utility of experience
<br>
to be a reliable guide to behavior.  Unfortunately, I now no longer
<br>
have a good understanding of exactly when experience can be trusted,
<br>
or is advisable to obtain, thanks to you.  ;-)
<br>
<p>At first one might say of a particular person's spiritual beliefs,
<br>
&quot;well, those are not publicly verifiable, so let's throw those
<br>
out---they're unscientific&quot;.
<br>
<p>But then, what about the &quot;experience of being addicted to X&quot;, where
<br>
X is some substance such that if you sample X then nothing else is
<br>
ever important to you again besides sampling more X?
<br>
<p>So now it's &quot;if (a) the experience is publicly verifiable and
<br>
open almost to anyone, and (b) the experience does not noticeably
<br>
alter you, then undergoing the experience is a good guide as to
<br>
its value&quot;, but that's getting pretty unwieldy.
<br>
<p>So, I'll just go back to my former claim:  if you believe physics
<br>
with all your heart, and so don't suppose that the particular atoms
<br>
that you are composed of have anything to do with who you are, then
<br>
you won't mind teleporting, because the pattern of atoms will be
<br>
the same after as before.
<br>
<p>Lee
