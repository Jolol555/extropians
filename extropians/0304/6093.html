</em><br>
<p>What you say is true.  However, one key issue is how
<br>
&quot;truly abundant&quot; the economy is.  In fact, one could
<br>
possibly measure an economy's abundance, relative to
<br>
what most participants in said economy find to be an
<br>
acceptable standard of living, as the percentage of
<br>
people who must labor in productive manners - or
<br>
possibly of available person-hours that must be spent
<br>
in such labor - to support the acceptable standard of
<br>
living.  Certainly, this percentage has been dropping
<br>
throughout history, despite the standard rising, but
<br>
it is still over 50% (or over 20%, if you count by
<br>
person-hours, excluding the third of the day lost to
<br>
sleep).
<br>
<p>The problem comes when people try to rationalize
<br>
actions in the present based on the assumption of this
<br>
percentage being, say, 10%, when in fact it is much
<br>
higher.  Lowering standards of living would decrease
<br>
the percentage, but this is not an acceptable solution
<br>
to most people.  Of course, it is human nature to want
<br>
to be in the percentage that does not have to work.
<br>
The best course of action seems to be to attempt to
<br>
lower the percentage, no matter what it is, rather
<br>
than to assume the percentage is already low and
<br>
proceed from there.  Standards of living do rise over
<br>
time, dragging this percentage up if no innovations
<br>
come up to match it (which rarely if ever happens),
<br>
but a significantly drastic increase in productivity
<br>
can significantly lower this percentage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;From a strictly utilitarian point of view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no better off for having had another Super Bowl,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposed to having spent the same money (as spent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; player's salaries, advertisements, et cetera) on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; researching bionics that could give any human the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strength and dexterity of the best football
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Society has been aware that this choice could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for many years now, and see what choice it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every time; clearly, strict utilitarianism for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater good is not the guiding mindset.  (Whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is rightly so is another debate, but I'd say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is their choice to make.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Society&quot; is not something alive than can choose. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection of individuals.
</em><br>
<p>True.  I was using &quot;society&quot; as shorthand for the net
<br>
effect of the decision of the majority of individuals.
<br>
(Not just 50%, either, but the kind of majority that
<br>
invokes, &quot;quantity has a quality all its own&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is not a danger of active mischief, but merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neglect of that which needs to be done, that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; felled capitalism's alternatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What needs to be done in a society of abundance? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isn't it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever some of the people find interesting and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruitful/entertaining/etc to do? Do you believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would find any such things important and interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do them?  Do you believe that would be true of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or most of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people on this list?
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant.  Capitalism's alternatives, to date, have
<br>
not existed in societies of abundance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Capitalism as we know it rests on a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the relationship between human wants and resources. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In areas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where that relationship becomes seriously modified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we know it may not be a reasonable choice.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly, why charge a price for that which is nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abundant without serious depletion or even net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use?  Particulary if doing so actually decreases the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that which is in question?  Why impose this model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no gain and actually loss in doing so?
</em><br>
<p>Again, that is assuming we are presently in a society
<br>
of abundance.  We are not, yet.  Capitalism is a good
<br>
balance for the society we are in.  If and when we
<br>
reach a society of true abundance, then perhaps we can
<br>
abandon capitalism - but not until then.
<br>
<p>In the mean time, peoples' time continues to be
<br>
valuable, so the price is an incentive for people to
<br>
spend their time coming up with the ideas in the first
<br>
place.  It is not a choice between charging for info
<br>
versus having the info produced for free, but between
<br>
charging for info versus having the info available to
<br>
no one under any circumstances (free or paid).
<br>
<p>Again, the best way to attain the goal of alternatives
<br>
to capitalism is to first put us into a society of
<br>
abundance.  To assume that we already are there and
<br>
act as if we were is to fail.  But once we are there,
<br>
the objections to these alternatives will melt away.
