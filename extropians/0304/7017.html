In a message dated 4/20/2003 10:42:20 PM Central Standard Time,               
<br>
<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20LUDDISM:%20&quot;Good%20Life&quot;%20debunked">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a> writes: A lot is hidden in the phrase \&quot;to make ends        
<br>
meet\&quot;.                                                                       
<br>
Now even the American Indians found their standard of living to be greatly    
<br>
enhanced by steel knives that almost never wore out, and other \&quot;high-tech\&quot;  
<br>
accouterments.                                                                
<br>
<p>Allegedly, there is another advancement that has came along to complicate the 
<br>
discussion.  Supposedly, with the advent of Agro-forestry, farm ponds, cell   
<br>
phones, home generated electricity and modern transportation it is possible   
<br>
or becoming possible to live on acres of unimproved weeds and woods that come 
<br>
close to feeding a family with very little involvement in labor.  In this     
<br>
scenario people have the privilege of living in a scenic setting, of getting  
<br>
an assist in their cost of living and still have enough time to go out and    
<br>
work at a profession.  I am told the tax collector has difficulty finding     
<br>
much to tax.                                                                  
<br>
<p><p>Quite true. I would delineate between trying to live a Luddite 'Good Life'
<br>
versus living an extropic one. I certainly would prefer the latter over the
<br>
former in any context. Everything you suggest is of the latter model.
<br>
<p>Perhaps what we need, then, is for someone to write &quot;The Extropic Good
<br>
Life: Living independently in an increasingly co-dependent world.&quot;  While
<br>
Damien's, and others, writing has brought extropic ideas to the rest of the
<br>
world very effectively, nobody I know of has actually written a step by step
<br>
instruction book for living extropically to compare with this Luddite tome...
