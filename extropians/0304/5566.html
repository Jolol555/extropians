historical (determined, probablistic, random, or chaotic).

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh well, here's a bit from THE ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL. I probably posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this last time around, but it might provide some chewy nuggets:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ============
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A discourse, in general terms, is a kind of local communication field which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arises in the unexplored linguistic gap between the realms of langue and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parole. Discourse, that is, has some of the characteristics of a language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, as a competence at a high level of abstraction, which yet arises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the performative speech acts which mediate the day-to-day exercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of power and knowledge. Perhaps each discourse, in as much as it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specified, is a slice through the polysemous jangle-jungle of conflicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meanings which become attached (through conflicts, and the pressure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novelties of every kind) to each human utterance or inscription.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let us look briefly at some of the typical moves in that variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discourse theory which is an offshoot of Althusserian Marxism, as discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a survey by Diane Macdonell (1986). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Typically enough, Macdonell's attempted redemption of Althusser ascribes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the relativist, constructivist commonplaces of discourse theory to what she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls his `radical breakthrough' (p. 13). Suddenly, after the 1969 essay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses', intellectuals in the French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communist Party were urged to see that superstructural social phenomena
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like families, religions and education (now `ISAs') might be as causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant as brute `relations of economic production'. Is it unfair of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to belittle  Althusser's discovery as a commonplace? Has not theory, under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his influence, opened our understanding of the self to unprecedented voids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of uncertainty? Not altogether unprecedented. Consider that much-debunked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsificationist Karl Popper, on the topic of subjectivity: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &quot;It seems to me of considerable importance that we are not born as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selves, but that we have to learn that we are selves; in fact we have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn to be selves....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &quot;I suggest that a consciousness of self begins to develop through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medium of other persons: just as we learn to see ourselves in a mirror, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the child becomes conscious of himself by sensing his reflection in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mirror of other people's consciousness of himself.&quot; (Popper and Eccles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1977, pp. 109-10)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Popper's figure of the mirror is not a sly appropriation of one of theory's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorite tropes. As he points out, it goes back at least to Adam Smith
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1759: The Theory of Moral Sentiments) who `puts forward the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society is a &quot;mirror&quot; which enables the individual to see and to &quot;think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his own character, of the propriety or demerit of his own sentiments and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conduct, of the beauty or deformity of his own mind&quot;, which suggests that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it were &quot;possible that a human creature could grow up to manhood in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solitary place, without any communication with his own species&quot; then he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not develop a self' (cited in Popper and Eccles, p. 111). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While not precisely gleaming with dark Lacanian opacity, this bourgeois
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classic is not very far from the celebrated entry via Alice's Looking Glass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Symbolic Order, and Althusser's construction of subjecthood via the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of `hailing' or `interpellation' by another. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The difference, of course, lies in the sustained Althusserian attack on any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `human nature' which might be considered necessary to underpin the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectiveness of any process of interpellation. As Terry Eagleton says, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ineffective to baptize a badger (Eagleton, 1983, p. 118; he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing Austin and illocutionary acts). In much the same way, it is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ineffective to interpellate a chair, or even a computer (although often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough I find myself doing so). Althusser, of course, was aware of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flaw in his case and attempted to correct it by what seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-evidently a vacuous re-definition:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &quot;[I]deology hails or interpellates individuals as subjects. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology is eternal, I must now suppress the temporal form in which I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented the functioning of ideology, and say: ideology has always-already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpellated individuals as subjects, which amounts to making it clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that individuals are always-already interpellated by ideology as subjects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which necessarily leads us to one last proposition: individuals are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always-already subjects.&quot; (Althusser, 1984, pp. 49-50)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The sole sense which can be made of this - Althusser says it `might seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradoxical' (p. 50), and he is right - is that individuals are genetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predisposed to take the imprint of culture. We are `primed' to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpellated. Now as it happens (it could have been otherwise; we might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been social insects) the kind of pre-formation this is lends itself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experience of inner consciousness, self-motivation, whether this be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valorized as `individual initiative' or stigmatized as `original sin',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `bourgeois illusion', or the clamor of Maya.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
