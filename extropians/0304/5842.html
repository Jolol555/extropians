<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand the pragmatic concern that the desire to get from one place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to another by a teleportation machine would be thwarted for the copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that gets left behind.  You have to consider whether there wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; something useful that an extra copy of yourself could accomplish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### In other words, suicide is a way of leaving places you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to be in, copying might be a way of reaching places you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to reach, and a combination of the two achieves both objectives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See, this is the problem with *not* renormalizing your probabilities. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suicide eliminates your measure.  Copying divides your measure.  Moving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfers your measure.  These are three different events.
</em><br>
<p>Something's not right here, because it seems to me that moving
<br>
obtains from letting delta t approach zero in copy+suicide 
<br>
scenarios.  In other words, just as in operating systems and
<br>
disk transfer operations, moving is often tantamount to copy
<br>
plus erasure.
<br>
<p>So, since erasure (or suicide) *does* decrease measure in the
<br>
many-worlds, what could be amiss?  I think that the answer is
<br>
that in the copy+suicide (i.e. move) case, no suicide really
<br>
takes place---the data is read into memory, the bits on disk
<br>
cleared, and the bits replaced elsewhere with the memory 
<br>
zeroed.  But, frustratingly, this just &quot;moves&quot; the problem to
<br>
the first point at which the data was copied from disk into
<br>
memory!
<br>
<p>So here must be the answer:  the initial copying (whether it's
<br>
operating systems or teleporters we're talking about) occurs
<br>
when the subject is first scanned.  In MWI-speak, this doubles
<br>
the measure of the subject!  The clearing of the disk bits (or
<br>
elimination of the original), then restores the many worlds
<br>
measure back to what it was---and the interval of time between
<br>
these operations can be made as close to zero as desired.
<br>
<p>Philosophic continuity is also preserved by regarding *moving*
<br>
as *copying+suicide*.
<br>
<p>(Has anyone seen my notion---philosophic continuity---or anything
<br>
like it in print?  The definition is:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of events or outcomes is &quot;philosophically continuous&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if tiny differences in timing of processes results in tiny
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differences in preference.
<br>
<p>This was inspired by the abortion debate.  If an egg is destroyed
<br>
10^-2 seconds before a sperm has reached it, then according to
<br>
some people the deaths involved is 0.  Yet if the egg is destroyed
<br>
10^-2 seconds after a sperm has reached it, then they believe that
<br>
the number of deaths involved is 1.  This holds true no matter how
<br>
small epsilon, i.e., 10^-2 is made, because there has to be an
<br>
instant (according to some theologies) in which a unit soul is
<br>
transferred to a living being, and destruction following that transfer
<br>
is a murder while destruction before that transfer is relatively
<br>
harmless.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Spin-up may be decomposable into a superposition of |left&gt; + |right&gt;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as many other possible bases, but actually detecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle moving up is not like detecting it moving left, then right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |move&gt; may be decomposable into a superposition of |copy&gt; + |suicide&gt;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but &quot;move&quot; is still not &quot;copy&quot; plus &quot;suicide&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the way that superposition arises in most of these considerations
<br>
is that at some point in time the superposition decoheres, right?  (A
<br>
good answer to this should occur in a new thread.)  That is, the only
<br>
difference I know of between collapse of the wave function and decoherence
<br>
is that the latter does not eliminate outcomes, but just reduces their
<br>
measure (keeping the total constant).
