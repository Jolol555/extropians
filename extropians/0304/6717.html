An important side note, however, is that the flour that was used was 
<br>
whole grain flour (probably stone ground) so that it would have provided 
<br>
many more vitamins and minerals than a non-enriched white flour based bread.
<br>
Also, &quot;Mannah from Heaven&quot; was something else.  Something that can be 
<br>
found by those knowledgeable about the desert, and which won't keep.  
<br>
The hypothesis that I've heard was that it was either bugs, or some part 
<br>
of or extrusion from bugs.  (Think of honey-dew ants before rejecting 
<br>
this out of hand.)  Now *that's* a paleolithic diet.
