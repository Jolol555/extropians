<p>I have in front of me the Kiplinger Tax Letter, Dated Nov 8, 2002.  It says:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;High Incomers are paying an even larger share of income taxes than in past
<br>
years, according to the new IRS data from tax returns for 2000, the most
<br>
recent set it has analyzed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top 1% of filers paid 37% percent of all income taxes, up from 36% the
<br>
year before.  But they made just 21% of the total adjusted gross income.  An
<br>
AGI of at least $313,400 was needed to be classified in the top 1%.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top 5% paid 56% of the total income taxes, and made 35% of all AGI.
<br>
The each had an income of $128,300 or more.  The upper 10% of all filers,
<br>
those with an AGI of at least $92,100 bore 67% of the income tax burden.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom 50% of filers paid just 4% of income taxes in 2000.&quot;
<br>
<p>While I am opposed to progressive taxes, (and involuntary taxation for that
<br>
matter) if we are going to have both, then I have a suggestion.  Why not
<br>
just elimate that bottom 50% of wage earners from the income tax, I mean,
<br>
c'mon!  It would amount to a 4% tax cut to income tax revenue, some of which
<br>
would be negated by how much would be saved by the IRS only dealing with 140
<br>
million people instead of 280 million.  Any politician who proposed this on
<br>
a presidential ticket could get 140 million votes.  This would be a
<br>
particularly wise move for republicans in congress to present, as the
<br>
overall change in the tax burden is minimal (or nill if a 4% budget cut is
<br>
associated with the relief for the bottom 50% of wage earners) and Democrats
<br>
will have a significant thing to whine about wiped off their agenda.  Though
<br>
they still may cry 'those tax cuts only benefit the rich' if any further
<br>
cuts occur.
