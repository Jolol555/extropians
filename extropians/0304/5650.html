From my point of view the term is &quot;U.S. military defenders of human rights.&quot;  Hubert, try to think of all the people who will be saved every year from torture, murder and rape (a form of torture) when the U.S. and British forces overthrow Saddam's sadistic regime.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>US warlords is quite adequate to describe Rummy and company. 
<br>
&quot;Defenders of human rights&quot; is not descriptive of invading a 
<br>
country on spurious grounds for reasons that have nothing to do 
<br>
with defending anyone's rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very sadly, sometimes for a time humanity must endure suffering and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death to stop a far greater evil.
</em><br>
<p>What evil is that?  Who says it is justified in this particular 
<br>
case?  There are mamny fine arguments that it is not in the 
<br>
least justified and that this is an act of aggression on our 
<br>
part.  We are talking about the invasion and occupation of Iraq 
<br>
by the US, occupation for an indefinite time-period, and only 
<br>
involving those US-picked Iraqis that we deign to have as mere 
<br>
advisers.  In exactly what way is this liberation from tyranny?
<br>
<p>In exactly what way will this act lead to an improvement in the 
<br>
attitudes toward the US in the region?  In what way will it lead 
<br>
to less terrorism?  In what way is the deterioration of US 
<br>
citizen rights under Patriot and other Acts conducive to 
<br>
&quot;defending human rights&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  This is what is going on now.  To want to stop all wars of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature would be a horrible disservice to oppressed and violated people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everywhere.  
</em><br>
<p>The USSR used to make the exact same argument about &quot;liberating&quot; 
<br>
various oppressed people.  It is a popular excuse for aggression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not being cold-blooded, but simply being realistic in the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of the human body politic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The highest cost will be paid to cut out the cancer that is 
<br>
bloating the body of the US beyond all recognition and infecting 
<br>
all the world with a lop-sided chop logic justifying any and all 
<br>
aggression if we can claim oppression of others, any semblance 
<br>
of threat to ourselves, or warm-hearted sharing of the &quot;American 
<br>
Way&quot; whether they are free to admit they want it or not.
<br>
