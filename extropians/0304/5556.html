WARMONGER EXPLAINS WAR TO PEACENIK (Author Unknown)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;PN: Why did you say we are we invading Iraq?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: We are invading Iraq because it is in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violation of security council resolution 1441.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country cannot be allowed to violate security
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;council resolutions.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But I thought any of our allies, including Israel,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were in violation of more security council
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolutions than Iraq.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: It's not just about UN resolutions. The main point
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that Iraq could have weapons of mass destruction,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the first sign of a smoking gun could well be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mushroom cloud over NY.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: Mushroom cloud? But I thought the weapons inspectors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said Iraq had no nuclear weapons.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Yes, but biological and chemical weapons are the issue.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But I thought Iraq did not have any long range
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missiles for attacking us or our allies with such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: The risk is not Iraq directly attacking us, but rather
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorists networks that Iraq could sell the weapons to.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But couldn't virtually any country sell chemical or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biological materials? We sold quite a bit to Iraq in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eighties ourselves, didn't we?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: That's ancient history. Look, Saddam Hussein is an evil
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man that has an undeniable track record of repressing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own people since the early eighties. He gasses his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies. Everyone agrees that he is a power-hungry
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lunatic murderer.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: We sold chemical and biological materials to a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power-hungry lunatic murderer?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: The issue is not what we sold, but rather what Saddam
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did. He is the one that launched a pre-emptive first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strike on Kuwait.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: A pre-emptive first strike does sound bad. But didn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our ambassador to Iraq, Gillespie, know about and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green-light the invasion of Kuwait?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Let's deal with the present, shall we? As of today,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq could sell its biological and chemical weapons to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Qaida. Osama BinLaden himself released an audio
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tape calling on Iraqis to suicide attack us, proving
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a partnership between the two.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: Osama Bin Laden? Wasn't the point of invading
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan to kill him?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Actually, it's not 100% certain that it's really Osama
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bin Laden on the tapes. But the lesson from the tape
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the same: there could easily be a partnership
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein unless we act.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: Is this the same audio tape where Osama Bin Laden labels
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saddam a secular infidel?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: You're missing the point by just focusing on the tape.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell presented a strong case against Iraq.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: He did?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Yes, he showed satellite pictures of an Al Qaeda
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poison factory in Iraq.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But didn't that turn out to be a harmless shack in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of Iraq controlled by the Kurdish opposition?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: And a British intelligence report...
<br>
&nbsp;PN: Didn't that turn out to be copied from an out-of-date
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graduate student paper?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: And reports of mobile weapons labs...
<br>
&nbsp;PN: Weren't those just artistic renderings?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: And reports of Iraqis scuttling and hiding evidence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from inspectors...
<br>
&nbsp;PN: Wasn't that evidence contradicted by the chief weapons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inspector, Hans Blix?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Yes, but there is plenty of other hard evidence that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot be revealed because it would compromise our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;security.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So there is no publicly available evidence of weapons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of mass destruction in Iraq?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: The inspectors are not detectives, it's not their JOB
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to find evidence. You're missing the point.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So what is the point?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: The main point is that we are invading Iraq because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolution 1441 threatened &quot;severe consequences.&quot; If we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not act, the security council will become an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant debating society.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So the main point is to uphold the rulings of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;security council?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Absolutely. ...unless it rules against us.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: And what if it does rule against us?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: In that case, we must lead a coalition of the willing to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invade Iraq.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: Coalition of the willing? Who's that?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Britain, Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain, and Italy, for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;starters.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: I thought Turkey refused to help us unless we gave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them tens of billions of dollars
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Nevertheless, they may now be willing.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: I thought public opinion in all those countries
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was against war.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Current public opinion is irrelevant. The majority
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expresses its will by electing leaders to make
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decisions.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So it's the decisions of leaders elected by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;majority that is important?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Yes.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But George B-
<br>
&nbsp;WM: I mean, we must support the decisions of our leaders,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however they were elected, because they are acting in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our best interest. This is about being a patriot.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the bottom line.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So if we do not support the decisions of the president,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are not patriotic?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: I never said that.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So what are you saying? Why are we invading Iraq?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: As I said, because there is a chance that they have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons of mass destruction that threaten us and our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allies.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But the inspectors have not been able to find any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such weapons.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Iraq is obviously hiding them.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: You know this? How?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Because we know they had the weapons ten years ago,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they are still unaccounted for.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: The weapons we sold them, you mean?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Precisely.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But I thought those biological and chemical weapons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would degrade to an unusable state over ten years.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: But there is a chance that some have not degraded.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So as long as there is even a small chance that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such weapons exist, we must invade?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Exactly.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But North Korea actually has large amounts of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usable chemical, biological, AND nuclear weapons,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND long range missiles that can reach the west
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coast AND it has expelled nuclear weapons inspectors,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND threatened to turn America into a sea of fire.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: That's a diplomatic issue.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So why are we invading Iraq instead of using
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diplomacy?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Aren't you listening? We are invading Iraq because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we cannot allow the inspections to drag on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indefinitely. Iraq has been delaying, deceiving,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and denying for over ten years, and inspections
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cost us tens of millions.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But I thought war would cost us tens of billions.
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Yes, but this is not about money. This is about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;security.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: But wouldn't a pre-emptive war against Iraq ignite
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radical Muslim sentiments against us, and decrease our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;security?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Possibly, but we must not allow the terrorists to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the way we live. Once we do that, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrorists have already won.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So what is the purpose of the Department of Homeland
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security, color-coded terror alerts, and the Patriot
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act? Don't these change the way we live?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: I thought you had questions about Iraq.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: I do. Why are we invading Iraq?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: For the last time, we are invading Iraq because the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world has called on Saddam Hussein to disarm, and he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has failed to do so. He must now face the consequences.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So, likewise, if the world called on us to do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something, such as find a peaceful solution, we would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have an obligation to listen?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: By &quot;world&quot;, I meant the United Nations.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the United
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: By &quot;United Nations&quot; I meant the Security Council.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the Security
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Council?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: I meant the majority of the Security Council.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the majority of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Security Council?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Well... there could be an unreasonable veto.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: In which case?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: In which case, we have an obligation to ignore the veto.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: And if the majority of the Security Council does not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support us at all?
<br>
&nbsp;WM: Then we have an obligation to ignore the Security
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Council.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: That makes no sense:
<br>
&nbsp;WM: If you love Iraq so much, you should move there.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or maybe France, with the all the other cheese-eating
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surrender monkeys. It's time to boycott their wine and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheese, no doubt about that.
<br>
&nbsp;PN: I give up.
