<em>&gt; How is it that Muslims (of several varieties) are looting in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place? One of the claims often made in favor of nasty Islamic countries is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that `at least people respect your property'; you can leave your bag
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unattended and nobody will touch it, etc. Images of thieves' hands cut
</em><br>
off.
<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe this restraint, if it's ever existed, is not internalized, but
</em><br>
merely
<br>
<em>&gt; a prudent response to the threat of authorities with a thousand eyes. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe an event of this magnitude is a cultural singularity where the usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values go on the blink. Maybe it's situational, and people feel they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just reclaiming what was stolen from them by the thugs in charge. (But one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hears of hospitals filled with injured and dying being looted.)

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, I have to say that this surprises me to read. I think Ramez can
<br>
answer best since he is from Egypt if I heard correctly. However, I will say
<br>
something about this since I spent many years of my life with Muslims, and
<br>
have visited and traveled in Libya and Egypt.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised because I never knew that Islamic countries had the
<br>
reputation of being a place where people respect your property. It certainly
<br>
isn't what I have experienced at all. In fact, the attitude of the people
<br>
reminds me a lot of post-communist Poland (sorry raf). I did not find that
<br>
people will respect you or your property UNLESS you are somehow 1) in a
<br>
higher social status that is apparent to them or 2) somehow connected
<br>
presently to them socially. In other words, when they think they can get
<br>
away with it, they do it. They are quite commonplace humans. Oh, if you are
<br>
in a mosque, no one will touch your stuff. That would just be wrong.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In public, in Egypt, men will fondle women of all ages and sizes, people
<br>
push, shove, and steal from each other, and it is all quite normal. I never
<br>
tried putting my bag down, but the Egyptian woman I was with kept tight hold
<br>
on hers and a hawk eye all around us. I believe if given the chance, our
<br>
bags would have walked off without us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scenes of looting I see in Iraq currently are not surprising to me.
<br>
The people are not benefiting from a democracy or a free market. People live
<br>
very modestly for the most part. If A has a hammer, A wants to keep it; it
<br>
belongs to A no matter how he came to have possession of it. If B takes A's
<br>
hammer, B wants to keep it; it belongs to B. Both A and B feel no one has
<br>
the right to take the hammer from them. However, C-Z feel that who ever has
<br>
the hammer should share, since that is only fair, until C has the hammer,
<br>
and you see where it goes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How it goes in Saudia I have no idea, it is one country I will never
<br>
visit. I would imagine that there the threat of appendage separation would
<br>
cut down on theft. The womens' situation there is different as well.
