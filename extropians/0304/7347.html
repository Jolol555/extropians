<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is the shuttle that screwed that it is no longer safe to put 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in it???
</em><br>
<p>That's the Big Question.  Answering it in any precise way is impossible,
<br>
which makes the cumbersome, politically-driven process of recertifying
<br>
the shuttle for manned flight so difficult.  The over-all STS system is
<br>
so complex that it's really not possible to make accurate statements
<br>
that it's &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;not safe.&quot;  
<br>
<p>The question of safety has to be considered in the context of mission.
<br>
If timing and cost for shuttle flights weren't crucial, it could
<br>
probably be considered very safe, indeed.  But with its role in the ISS
<br>
program, timing and cost ARE central.  NASA is now irretrievably
<br>
committed to flying STS on time and a lot.  Given the number and
<br>
complexity of subsystems involved, this pushes operational costs through
<br>
the roof.  When pressed into the schedule demanded by ISS construction
<br>
and maintenance, the effort/cost curve goes near vertical well short of
<br>
the 100% safety point.  That's the problem.
<br>
<p>The maddening reality of politics drives manned space enthusiasts to
<br>
despair at this point of the analysis.  Based on my reading and
<br>
analysis, I firmly believe that for the recurring cost of just four or
<br>
five shuttle flights (i.e. a couple of $billion), a much safer and more
<br>
reliable crew transfer system could be developed.  But doing this would
<br>
require much more political will than can be mustered.  The STS was
<br>
intentionally designed to have as broad and diverse a political
<br>
constituency as possible, in order to ensure its survival during the
<br>
lean years of the 1970s when it was developed.  This is a case of a
<br>
brilliant political strategy from an earlier age that has visited a
<br>
curse on our time.  Unfortunately, no one inside NASA can exercise the
<br>
kind of policy courage that would be required to allocate the funds, and
<br>
no one outside NASA (i.e. higher up in the Bush administration) has the
<br>
vision to make doing it a high enough political priority to exercise the
<br>
power to make it happen.
<br>
<p>Thus the problem ...
