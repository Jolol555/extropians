<p>Our biosphere is pretty uninteresting to species that can construct
<br>
anything constructable.  Is an intelligent species developing around
<br>
a star that happens to have a hot-giant in close orbit around their
<br>
sun (if such species can develop in such a solar system) going to
<br>
focus its attention on communicating with us or focus their attention
<br>
on dismantling the gas giant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dangerous civilizations in our vicinity may be reactive rather

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There aren't any &quot;threats&quot; to a distributed replicated intelligence
<br>
(like a Matrioshka Brain) except perhaps a black hole.  The only
<br>
weapon they would care about would be intertial weapons -- someone
<br>
throwing a *lot* of matter at them.  But it requires one *huge*
<br>
amount of matter to deal with something that masses 10^25 to 10^27 kg
<br>
and is distributed over a volume of space from 30 AU to 3 light years
<br>
in diameter.
<br>
<p>Just like Angel -- you can't kill it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, worse than to be hated is to be ignored...
</em><br>
<p>They have better things to do.  I just read Egan's &quot;The Plank Dive&quot;
<br>
last night.  Didn't understand much of the black hole stuff but
<br>
thought the transmission of a human &quot;entity&quot; in an exabyte of
<br>
information was great.
<br>
<p>Previously I had thought this would be impossible.  An exabyte
<br>
is 10^18 bytes which is a zettabit (10^21 bits).  To even begin
<br>
thinking about this one has to learn how to modulate a carrier
<br>
of X-rays (10^18 Hz) to Gamma-rays (10^20 Hz) to carry a zettabit.
<br>
That did not look like an easy task to do in a short period
<br>
of time (SciFi authors get to ignore some of these more complicated
<br>
details with a little hand-waving).
<br>
<p>But, if one used digital encoding of femtosecond (10^-15 sec) laser
<br>
pulses (~10fs is about the best we can do now) *and* used an array
<br>
of such lasers to send the pulses accurately synchronized with
<br>
each other (because the setup takes much longer than the pulse),
<br>
then it does appear that you could transmit an zettabit in less
<br>
than a month -- using current technology it could take anywhere
<br>
from 6-12 months.
<br>
<p>So if ETI are communicating they are likely doing it at high pulse
<br>
rates (which almost all detectors we now use are unlikely to
<br>
detect for say OSETI).  In addition it seems possible, if not probable,
<br>
that the frequencies may be high (UV to gamma) where we aren't
<br>
currently listening.  Finally, they aren't going to be sending
<br>
these data streams at us -- all we will see is the spread of
<br>
the lasers if we happen to be along the line of sight between
<br>
them and someone they are sending the data to.
