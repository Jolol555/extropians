I just want to say how impressed I am that Aubrey de Grey has joined the list.  I unfortunately did not get to attend the most recent Alcor Conference, but friends told me his talk was one of the best given.
<br>
<p>About Dr. de Grey from the Alcor Conference site:
<br>
received his BA, MA and PhD degrees from the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, where he is currently a research associate. His main research areas are the role and etiology of oxidative damage in mammalian aging, including both mitochondrial and extracellular free radical production and damage, and the design of interventions to reverse the age-related accumulation of oxidative and other damage.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>About his topic at the conference:
<br>
Engineering negligible senescence: rational design of feasible, comprehensive rejuvenation biotechnology 
<br>
<p>We now have a detailed understanding of where and how our natural maintenance and repair systems fail to work indefinitely, and also a large arsenal of tools that can potentially be used to improve them. Hence, we can at last approach the goal of extreme life extension with a hard-headed, engineering frame of mind. I have recently joined with several noted biogerontologists to explore how extreme life extension (&quot;negligible senescence&quot;) can be engineered in the foreseeable future. In this talk I will describe the components of our proposed strategy, with emphasis on the two areas in which I am most heavily involved (mitochondrial mutations and lysosomal aggregates). 
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I wish this research scientist were given the chance to make good on his statement quoted in Cryonics Magazine (paraphrased here) &quot;with 100 million dollars and ten years I could lay the foundation for human immortality.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is just the price of one Hollywood summer movie, or one or two military aircraft!  And the benefits from such research would go on forever.  I hope in some way he can find the funding he seeks.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John Grigg
