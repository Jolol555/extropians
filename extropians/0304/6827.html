</em><br>
<p>I agree with almost everything Harvey said [esp. that which I snipped]
<br>
but would comment on the above segment.
<br>
<p>The problem with this is that you end up dead, dead, dead.
<br>
We are facing a cascade of technological developments,
<br>
including whole genome engineering to allow genome augmentation,
<br>
followed by whole genome replacement (using robust molecular
<br>
nanotechnology) followed perhaps by uploading.  The question
<br>
we face is &quot;How do we get ourselves to the time when we can
<br>
surf each of these transitions?&quot;
<br>
<p>So, I agree with the &quot;moderate&quot; perspective.  *But* if there are
<br>
&quot;masked&quot; genetic programs that can be invoked to significantly
<br>
expand &quot;healthspan&quot; then I think one should seriously look at
<br>
them.  CR is one such program that seems to be relatively intact
<br>
(in terms of improving health &amp; aging measures) in the primate
<br>
studies currently being done.  Selective protein restriction
<br>
may be another such program.
<br>
<p>It may be the case that selective PR is an easier diet to adhere
<br>
to than CR -- in which case it might help many more people extend
<br>
their healthspans allowing them to &quot;surf the waves&quot; (cited above).
<br>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there have only been limited studies
<br>
done with PR.  And it may also be very difficult to separate the
<br>
effects of CR from PR.  But aging is a complex process it makes
<br>
complete sense (to me) that one might extend longevity by:
<br>
(a) reducing calories and therefore oxidative damage to DNA;
<br>
and
<br>
(b) increasing protein recycling and lowering the abundance of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inefficient/malproductive proteins damaged by oxidation,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carbonylation, thiolation, nitrosylation, deamidation, etc.
<br>
<p>Trying to separate these effects at the experimental level
<br>
(if they both result in extended healthspan) may be *very*
<br>
difficult.
<br>
<p>So -- one needs to make decisions as to whether one wants to
<br>
believe the &quot;theories&quot; and act on them.  If one waits for the
<br>
&quot;proof&quot; it may arrive too late.
<br>
