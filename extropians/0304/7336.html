</em><br>
<p>Well, it seems they've also had a lot of help from Russia too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is the LM as safe as, say, the Ariane? If not, the fact that

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ariane 4 seems fairly reliable for an ELV.  Ariane 5 is another story.
<br>
Guess what?  Ariane 4 is no more and they're only launching 5s now,
<br>
IIRC.
<br>
<p>Now, I don't doubt the Chinese aren't using different standards than the
<br>
ESA.  Also, the ESA seems to NOT be in the business at all of manned
<br>
launches and, IIRC, has no plans for them.  China wants desparately to
<br>
be in that business.
<br>
<p>Also, unlike, say, the Soviet and US programs at a similar stage, China
<br>
can benefit now from the knowledge already gained and pretty much made
<br>
public.  Circa 1961, no one knew about almost all the aspects of manned
<br>
spaceflight.  42 years later, there's a lot more knowledge -- including
<br>
just the trivial knowledge that it can be done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Since at this point the Chinese manned space program
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is all about national pride and international prestige, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; seems to me that CNSA has as much incentive to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; safe as NASA does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or the Soviet Union? I seem to recall that there was at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one manned Soviet mission that never made the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers specifically because it was fatal. I have also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard rumors that the Chinese already had a manned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flight that turned out similarly.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is today's context.  If the Chinese publicize the launch --
<br>
which they seem to want to do -- then it will be monitored.  Even if
<br>
not, this is not 1961.  There are plenty of information sources on what
<br>
the Chinese are up to once they launch.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying this will keep them honest or that their intentions are
<br>
noble, but they don't have the kind of lid the Soviets had during the
<br>
1960s on their space program.
<br>
<p>Later!

<p>&quot;Some works have a wholeness, and are endowed with a precise and
<br>
original literary image; characters are drawn in unfathomable depths;
<br>
the composition has an extraordinary capacity for enchantment, and the
<br>
book is indivisible; through the pages comes the astonishing, unique
<br>
personality of the author: books like that are masterpieces, and only
<br>
someone who is actually indifferent both to fine prose and to the cinema
<br>
can conceive the urge to screen them.&quot; -- Andrei Tarkovsky
