<em>&gt; &gt; If you are a Libertarian I suggest you go back and review the

<em>&gt; party back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when the movie Deliverance came out. The basic philosophy hasn't

<em>&gt; changed a

<em>&gt; &gt; whit and a pre-emptive attack is still an allowable defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree totally. If Iraq posed an immediate threat to us we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been within our rights to attack. What this thread is about, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements about such a threat coming from the administration were a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tissue of lies. So, there was no threat, and apparently not any WMD 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either, and it appears some administation officials have now said as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much to ABC.
</em><br>
<p>As has been mentioned here, Media Research Center has documented the
<br>
heavily anti-war bias of ABC, which included broadcasting much
<br>
disinformation and anti-war propaganda, misrepresentation of
<br>
battlefield conditions and US progress, misrepresentation of Iraqi
<br>
public opinion, use of ex-generals who were uniformly wrong in their
<br>
predictions of the war (which explains why they are ex-generals),
<br>
extensive coverage of anti-war demonstrations, claims that these
<br>
demonstrations represent US public opinion even when polls show a
<br>
nearly 80% preference for the war.
<br>
<p>I would put any claim by ABC about what &quot;some adminisration officials
<br>
have now said&quot; at about the same credibility level of, say, what the
<br>
Volence Policy Center or Brady Campaign has to say about gun rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only reason a majority of the american people supported the war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is because americans will support their country at war. The polls I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw prior to the launching of hostilities seemed to indicate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; americans would support the war given a U.N. mandate. Remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those polls?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and those polls were taken before French duplicity became
<br>
apparent. Since that time, France is now ranked in the top five
<br>
countries most hostile to the US, according to public opinion. We've
<br>
found documents in Iraq showing that France had given it classified
<br>
material shared with it by the US, as well as transcripts of private
<br>
conversations between Chirac and Bush.
<br>
<p>What do the polls say the US public thinks of the UN now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there was no threat then this was an aggressive war and a war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime. (Some may say the last war never really ended, and argue the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rightness of it legalistically, which is fine). But there was no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat.
</em><br>
<p>Latest news on CNN is that, 40 miles north of Tikrit, a missile site
<br>
has been found with mobile labs, dozens of drums containing blister and
<br>
nerve agents, all protected behind berms, along with documents and the
<br>
highest quality gas masks available.
<br>
<p>Canadian news also indicates that a crewman of a ship bound for Canada,
<br>
which is now impounded in Nova Scotia, had an Egyptian crewman on it
<br>
who has succumbed to what appears to be anthrax. It will be interesting
<br>
to see what unofficial cargos may be found on board.
