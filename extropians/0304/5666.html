On Wed, 2 Apr 2003, Ramez Naam, commenting on my discussion of iron
<br>
retention/management in the human body wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This may also be an example of something that was adaptive during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of human evolution but has become less so in the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps -- it would be useful to study the few remaining primitive
<br>
cultures to learn whether they (a) accumulate iron at the rate
<br>
of steak eating individuals in affluent cultures; and (b) whether
<br>
they lose iron at higher rates (due to accidents).  Conclusions
<br>
about (b) may be difficult because humans have eliminated most
<br>
of the larger predators from the planet -- we do not have the
<br>
hazard function (even in more primitive cultures) that we once had.
<br>
<p>The next time I have an opportunity to speak with Steve Austad
<br>
I will try to remember to raise these points with him -- he is
<br>
perhaps most qualified to consider these topics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've heard it theorized (maybe even by you, Robert?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that humans in ancient times had lower iron consumption (less meat)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and greater iron loss among males (more bleeding from accidents and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence).
</em><br>
<p>I have speculated about this in the past so I might be the source.
<br>
But it could be developed independently by individuals familiar
<br>
with the complexity of iron management in the human body.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a result, the negative effects of extremely high iron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrations in the body were never experienced.
</em><br>
<p>Yes -- so &quot;antagonistic plieotropy&quot; might be context sensitive
<br>
(i.e. are we talking about &quot;ancient&quot; or &quot;modern&quot; humans).
<br>
That adds significantly to the complexity of the discussion.
<br>
(Obviously things like fat and calorie management become
<br>
significant here -- we (at least in developed nations) are
<br>
not in the same situation our ancestors were with respect
<br>
to these nutrients.  So the genetic programming for their
<br>
management is highly likely to be suboptimal (at least
<br>
in the environments we currently live in).
<br>
<p>R.
