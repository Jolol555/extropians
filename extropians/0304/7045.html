Stargate has some pretty nice androids.  Reese shows the dangers of
<br>
replicating nanotech and bad orders; she made some toys and told them to go
<br>
multiply and survive.  Years later the Asgard are fighting for their lives
<br>
against these things.  The second appearance of the upload-robots of SG-1 in
<br>
&quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; was pretty effective, too, from robot-Jack's &quot;Hey George!&quot;
<br>
(George Hammond being Jack's CO -- but the robot isn't in the chain of
<br>
command, hee hee) to the other two robot's stoicness in the face of torture.
<br>
Being fairly accurate replicas they could feel pain, but they could also
<br>
maintain an impassivity I doubt the biological originals could have.
<br>
<p>Otherwise they were nice for acting largely like their originals, although I
<br>
guess that was mostly reflected by Jack.  Between him fighting with himself
<br>
and Major Carter getting along with her alternate universe self we have a nice
<br>
demonstration that some people will be able to copy and cooperate and others
<br>
really won't get along with themselves.
<br>
<p>The entity from the system of energy beings who are vulnerable to radio waves
<br>
was kind of cute too.  Of course it was played by Amanda Tapping, so there's
<br>
interference there.
<br>
<p>There's always the Culture, of course.  Hard for me to pick out a single AI at
<br>
the moment, though.  I guess others have done a better job at spelling out why
<br>
they pick a favorite, e.g. emotionality (showing it's independent of
<br>
substrate) or I guess just pathos (Hal).  I keep hoping some TV show will show
<br>
the robots multiplying and self-modifying and being quirkily contemptuous of
<br>
'death' without being evil.  Instead they keep getting killed off.  The
<br>
Buffybot on &quot;Buffy&quot; got resurrected a couple of times but seems to have been
<br>
abandoned upon Buffy's return.
<br>
