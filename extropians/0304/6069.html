<p>I think what you are saying here is a dishonest rhetorical 
<br>
trick.  Our reason for invading Iraq is no more regime change 
<br>
than it is benefitting the people of Iraq than it is WMD.  So to 
<br>
now act as if regime change and therefore an attack on 
<br>
government is the sole or the real motive sufficiently to say we 
<br>
were only attacking a government seems quite inaccurate to say 
<br>
the least.  We want control of that region for economic and 
<br>
geo-political reasons.  We also want to send a message to other 
<br>
countries to toe our line.  There is a lot more going on than an 
<br>
attack on a particular government and a lot more suffers the 
<br>
consequences than just the government.  When a country is 
<br>
invaded the entire country is invaded including the homes, peace 
<br>
and safety of the people of that country.  To pretend otherwise 
<br>
is dishonest.
