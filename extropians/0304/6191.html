<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron h says that america reacted because there was reasonable proof that
<br>
USA was threatened, There has never been reasonable proof that Iraq was a
<br>
threat to the states,sometime Ron h, s   blind patriotism is beyond
<br>
belief.Regards Brian Booth
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Booth says that america shouldnt react because there was no
<br>
reasonable proof that the USA was threatened.  There has always been
<br>
reasonable proof that Iraq was a threat to the states.  Sometimes Brian
<br>
Booth's blind anti-americanism is beyond belief.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian, I hope this post illustrates the futility of your post.  Many
<br>
people consider thier to be a significant deal of evidence showing that Iraq
<br>
is a threat to *the people* of the United States.  Many of those people
<br>
qualified to make those decisions are also privy to a lot more information
<br>
than you are.  But even so, unless you refute the facts that the conclusion
<br>
stems from, then your comments serve to do nothing except preach to the
<br>
choir.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Dickey
