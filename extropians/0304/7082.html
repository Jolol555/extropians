Ron h noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Spike,
<br>
       Did I miss something?  Oil is selling for $25/barrel and they claim to 
<br>
<p>be able to recover it from a scrap product for $10 to $15 a barrel.  That 
<br>
sounds like an economic winner.
<br>
Ron h. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Again, this relates to my comment that the whole analysis of this process, 
<br>
which seems to be based on water being used for hydration, rather than the 
<br>
traditional dehydration, typified in thermal depolymerization. I also 
<br>
commented that we need a chemist or chemical engineer, and an economist to 
<br>
judge viability. The article also went on to not how many carbonaceous 
<br>
materials could benefit from this depolymerization, including oil and coal. 
<br>
The process is a winner even if it can co the trick at 25.00 bangers a 
<br>
barrel, as Ron is noting. However, this method, if workable, is also a waste 
<br>
removal dynamic, in which methane extracted could power the entire plant. The 
<br>
concept, if acting as stated, is an old idea, with a slightly upgraded 
<br>
synthesis track. We need experts to determine viability.
