</em><br>
<p>Again, I'm relating the paleodieter's perspective. If you do not accept the
<br>
argument from evolutionary science that we are best adapted to a diet devoid
<br>
of grain and dairy and legumes then obviously you won't accept the notion
<br>
that the burden of proof should be on those who advocate a deviation from
<br>
the paleodiet. 
<br>
<p>I don't think that is especially unreasonable, Harvey. Do you accept the
<br>
argument from evolution science? It is about 4 million years of evolutionary
<br>
history vs about 10,000 years since the dawn of agriculture. According to
<br>
calculations by Dr. Boyd Eaton, a specialist in dietary anthropology, 99.99
<br>
percent of our genetic makeup was formed prior to the advent of dairy and
<br>
agriculture. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And personally, I can't imagine anybody arguing *history* as evidence.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. This is also an infamous argument of the creationists in their
<br>
debates with evolution scientists. &quot;Macro-evolution (the evolution of new
<br>
species) can't be true empirical science,&quot; they say, &quot;because
<br>
macro-evolution has never been duplicated in a laboratory. It's only an
<br>
argument about historical evidence.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately macro-evolution is supported only by arguments about
<br>
historical evidence. Do you take it as science nonetheless?
