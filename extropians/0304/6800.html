<p>Alex, you don't need to go overboard on this -- I think the WHO has a
<br>
set of published measures that help prevent infection (things like
<br>
washing hands frequently, don't touch your face, etc.).
<br>
<p>Now that we have the genome sequence most major medical facilities
<br>
should have a test within a few weeks, or perhaps a month or more
<br>
(worst case) based on using PCR to amplify and detect the genome.
<br>
Its a little tricky to develop a test since the coronavirus genomes
<br>
are +stranded RNA (vs. -stranded RNA or DNA) so common PCR methods
<br>
(for DNA) have to modified somewhat.  [PCR for those who don't know,
<br>
stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction and it is a way to &quot;amplify&quot;
<br>
genomic sequences so one has enough information to look at.  Kerry
<br>
Mullis won a Nobel prize in chemistry in 1993 for its development.]
<br>
<p>Also, the figures I have seen seem to be putting the fatality rate
<br>
at between 3-4%.  It isn't clear to me whether that is greater than
<br>
influenza (percentage wise), but in terms of deaths, influenza wins
<br>
hands down (something like ~30,000+ deaths a year in the U.S. vs.
<br>
0 for SARS so far).
<br>
<p>Influenza is an orthomyxovirus whose genome is based on 8 pieces
<br>
of -stranded RNA.  The fact that it has 8 pieces of RNA allows
<br>
it to mix and match with other orthomyxoviruses in various
<br>
animals (not an uncommon situation for humans to get infected
<br>
with various orthomyxoviruses from animals on farms) so it
<br>
varies from year to year -- that is why one needs to be
<br>
revaccinated every year.  So influenza is much more dangerous
<br>
than SARS -- its just that the media are hyping SARS right now.
