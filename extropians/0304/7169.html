Clever marketing!
<br>
<p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/djus/030423/1108001165_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/djus/030423/1108001165_1.html</a>
<br>
<p><p><p>Earlier Wednesday, Imax and Warner Bros., a division of AOL Time Warner Inc. 
<br>
(NYSE:<A HREF="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=aol&d=t">AOL</A> - <A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/n/a/aol.html">News</A>) , announced that the second and third chapters of &quot;The 
<br>
Matrix&quot; trilogy, to be released in the spring and fall, will be 
<br>
digitally-remastered using Imax DMR - a technology that upgrades live-action 
<br>
35mm films into the Imax experience.
<br>
<p>Imax has said that the simultaneous release of first-run Hollywood event 
<br>
films in its theaters is the &quot;holy grail&quot; for the company, and it's something 
<br>
investors have been anxiously anticipating for some time.
<br>
<p>Although &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; will open in Imax theaters two or three weeks 
<br>
after its general release May 15, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; will open Nov. 5 in
<br>
&nbsp;both conventional and Imax cinemas, marking the first time that a 
<br>
live-action Hollywood film is released concurrently in both large- and 
<br>
standard-sized formats, known in the industry as a day-and-date release.
<br>
<p>Richard Gelfond, co-chief executive of Imax, said the deal is a &quot;watershed 
<br>
event&quot; for the company, as securing &quot;The Matrix&quot; sequels begins to answer 
<br>
Imax customers' questions about content.
<br>
<p>He explained that ensuring a steady supply of content from the studios, 
<br>
especially commerical Hollywood blockbuster films, is an integral part of the 
<br>
overall business strategy - selling Imax theater systems. The other component 
<br>
is the development of a product that will lower the costs to exhibitors of 
<br>
installing an Imax system in their multiplexes, which has already been 
<br>
accomplished with the Imax MPX system, announced in February.
<br>
<p>'A Visual Spectacle'
<br>
<p>Gelfond said that &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies met all of the criteria for the first 
<br>
Imax DMR day-and-date release. &quot;It's a visual spectacle, it has the kind of 
<br>
soundtrack that will take advantage of our 12,000-watt sound system,&quot; he told 
<br>
Dow Jones. &quot;And most importantly, they're really the franchise movies of the 
<br>
year. There wasn't a better film than The Matrix, and in fact, we got a 
<br>
little lucky that there were two of them.&quot;
<br>
<p>He said Imax had been negotiating with Warner Bros. for the third installment 
<br>
only, but when certain executives saw the tests, they were so impressed by 
<br>
the &quot; visual splendor&quot; that it turned into a two-picture deal.
<br>
<p>Unlike the Imax DMR releases last year of &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode 
<br>
II - Attack of the Clones,&quot; &quot;The Matrix&quot; films won't have to be shortened, as 
<br>
Imax reel units can now support film lengths of 150 minutes.
