<p>Then why does the 'poorest segment' recieve 30% more calories today than
<br>
they did 30 years ago if they have 'less money with which to buy that food'
<br>
?
<br>

<p>Certainly not like starving to death does.  If, in the future, things are so
<br>
crowded that we only get 500sf each, I wont find it as deplorable as you
<br>
might if those people living in 500sf apartments have heat, hot water,
<br>
sanitation, and food, something which some 30 - 80% of the worlds population
<br>
doesnt have, depending on which variables you consider.  Of course, 200
<br>
years ago 100% of the population did not have these things.
<br>
<p>So, to answer your question, if someone has food, health, heat, hot water,
<br>
clean water, and adequate sanitation, but they live in a 500sf apt instead
<br>
of a 3500 sf house, I'll play them the worlds smallest violon in empathy.  I
<br>
wont consider it a drastic reduction in 'standrad of living' as say, no food
<br>
or basic medical care might be a reduction in standard of living.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience rent exceeds food expenditures, often by a lot.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; urban rents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been increasing rapidly in many places.  Live elsewhere?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the jobs?
</em><br>
<p>The fact that rent exceeds food expenditures could very well be true, given
<br>
the facts I mentioned.  That we make more food and its cheaper than ever
<br>
before, and land is a definate finite resource.  However, the cost of living
<br>
is not so clear clut when things like regulation, zoning, politics, et al
<br>
are factored into the equation.  If we could build any type of building
<br>
anywhere (most liberatarians are opposed to zoning) and as close to another
<br>
building as we want, as long as that building meets safety requirements
<br>
(demanded either by your government or your local private anarchocapitalist
<br>
regulatory inspection firm) would we be seeing the drastic rising in living
<br>
costs?
<br>
<p>Additionally, all indictators suggest that population growth will stop
<br>
around 2015 - 2020, I believe it was, at around 12 billion.  Thus more
<br>
effecient building and construction methods will play a more important role
<br>
in reducing the cost of living arrangements.
