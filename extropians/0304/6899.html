<p><em>&gt; Bromelain: Is a proteolytic digestive enzyme that can enhance absorption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of protein. It  also affects protein turnover
</em><br>
<p>It might help with digestion in some cases, although I don't think most
<br>
people need help in that area.  However bromelain is itself a protein
<br>
and will be broken up in the digestive system just like all the others.
<br>
Orally consumed bromelain will get into your body to do anything to
<br>
protein turnover.  As far as the rest of your system is concerned,
<br>
it's just a source of amino acids like all other proteins.
