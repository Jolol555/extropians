<p>Yes, in fact I offered another one in a message to you in the other doomsday
<br>
thread that you started. Here it is again...
<br>
<p>...The SSA does not itself seem unreasonable to me. It is defined thusly:
<br>
&quot;Every observer should reason as if she were a random sample from the set of
<br>
all observers in their reference class.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Put simply, why should you assume that your observation of any particular
<br>
phenomenon should be different from anyone else's? For example when you do a
<br>
statistical test on a coin to determine if the coin is fair, you assume that
<br>
your observation of the coin's flips is a random sample of coin flip
<br>
observations taken from the population of all possible coin flip
<br>
observations of that coin that might be taken by all possible humans; i.e.,
<br>
you assume that your observations are a random sample from the set of all
<br>
observers in your reference class with regard to that coin, where your
<br>
reference class is &quot;humans&quot; or &quot;intelligent beings.&quot; If you don't make that
<br>
assumption then you cannot say that your analysis of the coin is meaningful
<br>
to other humans.
<br>
<p>We cannot speak meaningfully to one another about probabilities unless we
<br>
all assume that our observations are not unique to our individual
<br>
identities. In other words, we must assume your observed sequence of
<br>
coin-flips would have been just as likely to have been observed by me or by
<br>
anyone else who might have performed the same test on the same coin at the
<br>
same time. This is to say, as per the SSA, that we should each reason as if
<br>
we are random samples from the set of all observers in our reference class.
