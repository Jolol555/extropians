</em><br>
<p>Actually, given that you have no knowledge of any such non-random rules the
<br>
hat-giver might be following, your best guess is still green and for the
<br>
same reasons I outlined in my last message. It is in your best interest to
<br>
assume the hats are distributed randomly, even if you suspect they are not.
<br>
Any deviation from the SSA would tend to weaken your guess.
<br>
<p>For example if you are bald, and you have a hunch that bald guys tend to get
<br>
yellow hats, then you would weaken your guess by guessing yellow (unless of
<br>
course your hunch was based on solid evidence, but it isn't).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I knew that the person handing out the hats was 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of my guesses are weak.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. You know only that 90% of the hats are green. Given that you
<br>
must make a guess with your limited knowledge, your best guess is that you
<br>
are wearing a green hat. It's your strongest guess, regardless of the
<br>
distribution. To put this another way, any unknown non-random distribution
<br>
is as likely to favor green hats for you as it is to favor yellow hats for
<br>
you.
