<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The KKK calls  blacks and Jews scum, and they are no more correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are in calling the KKK scum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I were to say &quot;Hey gts, what do you think about the KKK?&quot; is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inconceivable that you would reply &quot;They're scum&quot;; and should I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of you if you did?  Personally I feel it is perfectly correct, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are scum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find such emotional outbursts understandable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but inaccurate.  The name-calling does nothing more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than connote the emotional state of the speaker.  Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we to suppose that there is such a thing as &quot;emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctness&quot;?  From many others' posts on this list, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that about sizes it up.
</em><br>
<p>Describing such by their right names is not 'an emotional outburst'.
<br>
What is wrong with name calling anyways? My name is Mike. You call me
<br>
Mike, you are name calling. I doubt very much that anybody on this list
<br>
would ever say &quot;David Duke is an okay fellow to hang out with, it is
<br>
just his opinions I despise.&quot; Does anybody claim that Jeff Dahmer had
<br>
any socially redeeming qualities? That Kim Jong Il is just a
<br>
misunderstood son of an overachieving father? That Saddam is just the
<br>
obvious result of an abusive childhood?
<br>
<p>While most people of many different opinions are generally of
<br>
benevolent intent toward their fellow man, even those I disagree with,
<br>
there are people who are seriously deficient in various qualities that
<br>
make one a rational, compassionate, logical, non-evil human being.
<br>
<p>Similarly, just as there are individuals who are inherently evil, there
<br>
are also individuals who are, despite being entirely benevolent of
<br>
intent, entirely dingbats in their thought processes toward applying
<br>
such intents to reality, or in perceiving the reality around them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One has to be &quot;emotionally correct&quot; when denouncing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racism, Communism, or Hitler, else in some quarters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's thought that one is pushing a wicked agenda of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind, and that probably one secretly is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascist, commie, or racist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That Joseph Stalin was a murdering, vicious dictator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Soviet Union is pretty close to being fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But to say that he was filthy animal, or a scumbag,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is nothing more than name calling, and I, for one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't applaud it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If the name does not accurately reflect the individual being described,
<br>
it is rightly improper. But if it accurately describes the individual,
<br>
then the quack desribes the duck.
