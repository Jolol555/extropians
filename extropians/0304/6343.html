<p>
Permit me to observe, in PCR style:
<br>
<p>Mr. Lorrey spoke boldly about barrels of poison agents. Field determination 
<br>
of the exact composition of chemical agents is AFAIK still very difficult. 
<br>
I don't know about any container labeling, nor have I heard reliable 
<br>
reports of same. One odd thing about a recent report of chemicals found was 
<br>
that Lewisite appeared present--this came as a surprise to me and I am 
<br>
suspecting a false positive on some other thing, like a pesticide; Lewisite 
<br>
was kind of primitive even in WWI.
<br>
<p>However, about the radiation find--
<br>
<p>There is a report that two separate instruments operated by two separate 
<br>
operators (both, I believe, Marines) showed dangerously elevated rad counts 
<br>
at a famous nuke research establishment called al-Tuwaitha, in some cases 
<br>
many meters away from entrances or enclosures. The original report was by a 
<br>
Pennsylvania newspaper's embedded reporter. FOX News picked it up and ran 
<br>
with it. To my knowledge, little new information has emerged since then.
<br>
<p>I hope you can Google from there: nav to www.foxnews.com, find the article, 
<br>
get the newspaper name, google that with al-Tuwaitha and plutonium. 
<br>
Whatever you think of FOX News, it was a plain old newsie who was on the 
<br>
scene first, not some rep of a glaringly hi-viz right wing mouthpiece.
<br>
<p>I don't know what, if any, methodology is employed to claim an isotope ID 
<br>
in the field. Off the top of my Boy Scout Atomic Energy Merit Badge, I 
<br>
doubt that many man-portable field threat analysis kits contain the kind of 
<br>
gear, such as multichannel rad spectral analyzers, neutron counters... 
<br>
which I'd think one would want to have available to make that 
<br>
determination. As you probably know, Pu is an alpha emitter, so that might 
<br>
be easily ruled in or out by using something field-available such as an 
<br>
alphaelectrometer paired with a gamma counter. You ought to be seeing a 
<br>
high reading on the first, and a low reading on the second--*IF* Pu's the 
<br>
major constituent. If there are a hodgepodge of isotopes present, I'd think 
<br>
ya gotta get a sample to the good gear (say, in Tennessee, or that the NEST 
<br>
folks trot around with) to figure it out.
<br>
<p>The available report suggests that some zones at many yards from an 
<br>
entrance are putting out something like a rad per minute or more (that's my 
<br>
Fermi number based on the &quot;start throwing up after three hours' exposure&quot; 
<br>
quote). That's pretty darned high level, but says nothing per se about the 
<br>
constituents.
<br>
<p>It is quite possible that the contamination was done purely as a 
<br>
confounding red herring--it silently hurts those who encounter it, draws 
<br>
attention, commits scarce Coalition resources, slows further inspection 
<br>
past the contamination, and there's a possible PR payoff if the Coalition 
<br>
forces overreact or misreport.
<br>
<p>It is also not inconceivable that the contamination was caused by looters 
<br>
or clueless Coalition forces. I think the latter is not very likely, since 
<br>
al-Tuwaitha was known as a nuke site, and that should have been part of 
<br>
every concerned Coalition team's briefing--treat it like a potential rad 
<br>
minefield--send the NBC threat evaluation specialist in first.
<br>
<p>I have no doubt that some will claim, or are claiming already, that the 
<br>
contamination was the result of Coalition or &quot;Zionist&quot; skullduggery.
<br>
<p>More information is needed. The specific report of weapons-grade Pu might 
<br>
have been smoke-blowing. That having been said:
<br>
<p>*It is far from impossible* that this was deliberately done as an act of 
<br>
war, by elements or agents of the Baathist government, or even that the 
<br>
contamination is related to the tranport of warhead or &quot;dirty bomb&quot; 
<br>
ingredients. And *if* poison gas counts as a WMD (and I'm not sure it makes 
<br>
the cut-off), then don't lethal levels of nuclear contaminants 
<br>
intentionally released to cause harm?
<br>
<p>Not fighting, just asking.

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; We are finding evidence every day, much of which is reported in the US

</em><br>
<em>&gt; When will you learn that I stopped considering your opinion worth taking
