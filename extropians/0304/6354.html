<p>I believe you're misinterpreting the idea behind the &quot;Paleolithic Diet.&quot; The
<br>
fact that a particular plant family or genus did or did not exist in Africa
<br>
or Europe during the time pre-humans and humans were evolving into our
<br>
present form implies little about whether or not that species is healthy to
<br>
eat. Tomatoes are members of the Solanaceae family. Although the genus
<br>
Lycopersicon ( containing various species of tomatoes) originated in South
<br>
America, there were numerous members of the Solanaceae family in Africa and
<br>
Europe during Paleolithic times, most of which are poisonous, some of which
<br>
are good as food (Solanum macrocarpum, for example).
<br>
<p>Another well-known member of the Solanaceae family (also, interestingly,
<br>
known as the Nightshade family), Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), was
<br>
apprently around in abundance when the human species was new, but that
<br>
certainly does not mean you'd want to cook up a mess of the fruit for
<br>
dinner.
