On Thu, 3 Apr 2003, Adrian Tymes wrote, commenting on
<br>
whether we can ever &quot;change minds&quot;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes.  Granted, it is almost always in contexts where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new information brings different values to the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system of deductions, rather than where the system of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deductions was itself changed, but it has happened.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, yes -- I will grant the &quot;minds change in the face
<br>
of overwhelmingly superior knowledge&quot;.  I could bury
<br>
one in minutia regarding computer architectures and
<br>
genes involved in aging.  Eliezer could bury us in
<br>
the details of developing an evolved AI.  Greg in the
<br>
complexity of the fine points of international law,
<br>
Max in fine points of significant philosophical positions,
<br>
Anders in the details of how certain subsegments of the
<br>
brain contribute to &quot;intelligence&quot;, Amara on the numerous
<br>
fine details on the distribution of *dust* in our solar
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>That is one of the things that makes the ExI list so
<br>
interesting.  If you have been around even a little while
<br>
one knows when to defer to greater expertise.
<br>
<p>So, ok, I will grant this point (see I'm changing my mind) --
<br>
in the face of a huge body of evidence that you don't know
<br>
what you are talking about and it is clear that other
<br>
contributers might be much more well informed -- Extropians
<br>
do indeed &quot;change their minds&quot;.  So we capture back the
<br>
&quot;rational thinking&quot; vector.  (That at least is a step
<br>
in the right direction.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, I had been thinking cryonics was horribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive, doomed to remain accessible only to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idle rich; the facts, I have learned, are otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Ok -- a good example to cite.  You were under misimpressions
<br>
and conversations on the the list provided new education
<br>
that caused you to re-evalueate some previous conclusions.
<br>
(I'll grant a &quot;change of mind&quot; card to this.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The emotional debates tend to be unproductive, yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stick to the facts, and you may convince people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stick to emotions, and you mainly preach to the choir.
</em><br>
<p>Now this may be an important observation (it goes back
<br>
somewhat to Greg's recent comments I think).
<br>
<p>How do we promote discussions based on &quot;facts&quot; (or perhaps
<br>
qualify them when the facts may be open to debate)?
<br>
<p>This may get very hard -- even considering the relatively neutral
<br>
topic of cosmology -- recent articles have created questions about
<br>
everything from the shape (and lifetime) of the universe to cosmic
<br>
ray particle densities.  If one can't count on the &quot;facts&quot; of the
<br>
universe itself -- what &quot;facts&quot; can you count on?
<br>
