Not really.  Trusted computing can be designed to do just what you say.  
<br>
The question is, who is designing it, and do you trust them to act in 
<br>
your best interest.  So though it can act as you say, it also has many 
<br>
other modes of action, and under the control of a (the) major software 
<br>
vendor, moving to a mode where more control resides with the OS vendor 
<br>
has obvious benefits.  So people are expecting that the be the mode.
<br>
<p>Note:  I expect the original mode to be relatively &quot;open&quot;, in that you 
<br>
are able to override the default actions.  But a gradual shift to modes 
<br>
where this becomes more and more difficult is to the obvious advantage 
<br>
of the Signing Authority.  This would lead in a period of less than a 
<br>
decade in only the Signing Authority being able to allow programs to run 
<br>
on &quot;your&quot; computer.  The techniques for accomplishing this are clearly 
<br>
laid out, though the original specs don't talk about using them.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we could depend on the good will and fairness of the Signing 
<br>
Authority, but I have my doubts as to the wisdom of that.  As to the 
<br>
&quot;open area&quot;, that can be eliminated with a simple ROM chip, that 
<br>
contains the needed activation code for the CPU, and is encrypted.  Even 
<br>
ROT13 would do, since there is clear dependance on legal measures to 
<br>
prevent replacements.  (But the early indications are that it might be 
<br>
serialized on the chip.)
<br>
<p>There is no technical reason that this hardware couldn't also run other 
<br>
operating systems, but it isn't really to the benefit of the signing 
<br>
authority to permit this to be at all easy.  So there would probably be 
<br>
licensing agreements with various manufacturers that would make this 
<br>
difficult to impossible.  (Note:  the technical measures are acting as 
<br>
facilitating mechanisms, not as requiring that matters head in this 
<br>
direction.)
<br>
<p>So there's no technical reason that &quot;Trusted Computing&quot; shouldn't be 
<br>
trusted.  And there are still very good reasons.
