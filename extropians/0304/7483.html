<p>Note that my point about empathy is for your own benefit, not on behalf
<br>
of some mystical moral imperative. Also, is slaughtering wild animals for
<br>
livestock the most empathetic behavior you could imagine toward them? It
<br>
might be a movement in the right direction (albeit impractical), but
<br>
flawed on at least one end. I don't necessarily have a better plan of
<br>
action for wild animals - although I note that not all of them are
<br>
violently predated. My vegetarianism is usually explained in reference to
<br>
domesticated animals, most of whom would be kept regardless of whether or
<br>
not they were killed for food (cows for milk, chickens for eggs).

<p><em>&gt; Humans are thrown into the world as natural omnivores. If I have any moral

</em><br>
<p>Nature has no design :) I certainly wouldn't bother someone who ate meat
<br>
in order to survive (I don't even bother meat-eaters at all in real life,
<br>
unless they tilt at vegetarians). But most people I know don't need to eat
<br>
meat to survive. They eat far beyond survival needs, artifically-processed
<br>
food that is promoted by the culture. It's all a massive exercise in lack
<br>
of thoughtfulness. On the other hand, you do seem to have been very
<br>
thoughtful about your diet, but vegetarians like me include an aesthetic
<br>
dimension yours is lacking. (Your aesthetic emphasizes following Nature,
<br>
which I have critiqued to pieces in my own thinking... Nature isn't
<br>
leading us anywhere, except to certain death and suffering...)
