<em>&gt; One of many things I fancy about Greg is his candor.  (Psst - I'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checking him out in a few weeks on our scuba diving vacation. :-))
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I'm curious about the attraction of Scuba.  My sister, my father,
<br>
and his wife are serious Scuba fans. When they were first getting
<br>
into it I had a bout of Meniere's disease, so I begged off, figuring
<br>
my ears didn't need the extra pressure. But that's all gone now, so
<br>
I don't really have any more excuse, but I don't see enough benefit
<br>
either.  I'm not likely to learn anything new I couldn't learn from
<br>
books or films, the experience would be entertaining I suppose, but
<br>
probably not moreso than any number of other recreational activities.
<br>
So is it really worth the fairly significant risk of death?&quot;
<br>
___________
<br>
The sensation is fantastic.  Going deep into the water is like going into a
<br>
different environment. I like attempting to communicate with sea life and
<br>
to explore different rock formations, etc.  Night diving is fabuluos if the
<br>
moon is not too bright.  There is also a unique sense of partership with
<br>
your dive buddy.  You rely on each other and you learn to communicate in a
<br>
different way than on land.
<br>
<p>It seems that if a diver is conscientious about diving, the rules, dept,
<br>
time, etc. that he or she is pretty safe.  I have no desier to go into
<br>
caves or dive in very deep waters (over 100 ft.) or do dangerous diving.  I
<br>
want to enjoy the tropics and in California, teh kelp forest.
<br>
<p>I am not knowledgeabel about ear problems.  Greg is an expert, so he can
<br>
advise you on this.
<br>
____________
<br>
<p>&quot;If danger is part of the attraction, why not do something that gives
<br>
a more intense sensation of danger with lower risk, like skydiving
<br>
or bungee jumping (my father and I did a jump from a railroad
<br>
bridge over Feather River canyon once--that was an experience I am
<br>
glad to have had but feel no compulsion to repeat)?&quot;
<br>
_______________
<br>
<p>Danger is definitely not part of the attraction for me.  I can't speak for
<br>
Max, but I am sure that if it was a &quot;dangerous&quot; sport, Max would not do it
<br>
either.  Skydiving and bungee jumping see more dangerous.  I can't skydive,
<br>
as much as I really wold love to, because of my knees adn neck.
<br>
<p>I like down hill skiing.  Taht is a real thrill for me.  Yet, even with
<br>
skiing, I no longer hot dog ski and avoid mogels.
<br>
<p>Scuba diving, when following the rules and diving with a buddy, is not a
<br>
very dangerous sport.  Ear problems are a danger though.
<br>
<p>best,
<br>
Natasha
