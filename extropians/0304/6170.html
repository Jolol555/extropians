<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Across the Middle East, people struggled to reconcile images of
</em><br>
celebrating
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Iraqis with widely held suspicions about the United States' motives.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Indeed, I am sure some members of this list are stuggling to put a
</em><br>
negative
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; spin on this event as well.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Our motives were not to free the Iraqis.  At one time I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you admitted as much at least indirectly.  You have seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe the motive was WMD.  We found none.  So do the Iraqis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dancing in the street say that our motives were other than what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were or that the war was justified?  I don't think so.
</em><br>
<p>If I did not admit as much, I would freely do so now.  At no point in time
<br>
did I believe that freeing the Iraqi people was the US sole or primary
<br>
motivation.  Frankly I dont care.  You seem really hung up on what the
<br>
motivation is, try judging on actions instead of motivations.  We can never
<br>
really truly know what is motivating Bush anyway, or anyone for that matter,
<br>
so all we can really judge people on are actions, NOT motivations.  But
<br>
whether bush tossed some chicken bones or weighed the options in depth with
<br>
advisors, the point is we are there and the Iraqi people are / will be free.
<br>
Cant you at least rejoice in the fact that 20 million people who were
<br>
previously living under the horrific oppression of a murderous tyrant are
<br>
now (or soon will be) free?
<br>
<p>And yes, I believe a primary motivation was WMD, and the fact that a
<br>
despotic west hating racist tyrant hadem and wanted more and wanted to use
<br>
them.  When you say &quot;We found none&quot; I can only laugh.  As others have
<br>
pointed out how silly this statment is, I wont simply repeat them.  I will
<br>
repeat something I said to you a while back on this very same point, we all
<br>
ready have found WMD, in the 1994 inspections.  Thousands upon thousands of
<br>
warheads, growth media, delivery systems, etc. etc. etc.  I believe your
<br>
response to that was 'where did you hear that from' to which I (and I
<br>
believe Mike Lorrey) noted it came from Hans Blixs speech.  A significant
<br>
majority of these weapon systems and delivery systems were not accounted for
<br>
in that novel Saddam produced, which meant he still had them.  I hope from
<br>
now on you will cease to say comments alluding to our lack of ability to
<br>
find WMD, when we all ready found them nearly ten years ago.  We are
<br>
attempting to figure out what happened to them now.  This is why Saddam's
<br>
'cooperation' was completely absurd, he could have simply put everything out
<br>
in a parking lot and said 'here it is'.  Yet the media kept parroting the
<br>
whole 'we have yet to find any WMD' line, which as I have tried to make
<br>
clear, is a gross mis-representation, they should have been saying 'We still
<br>
dont know what happened to the missing WMD'  Had they been found in the
<br>
first place, the war may have been averted entirely.
