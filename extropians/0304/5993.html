<p>Historically speaking, the nuclear family model (monogamous heterosexual
<br>
&quot;parent units&quot; and their 2.+ kids, with the male working to support the
<br>
female for all or part of the time while nurturing young 'uns) is a
<br>
relatively recent one.  Yet, our (U.S.) society is biased to the needs of
<br>
that nuclear family model, and subtly (sometimes not so subtly) penalizes
<br>
family units built on a different model (a parent who may choose to rear a
<br>
child without a partner, as in the case of males - heterosexual or not - who
<br>
are now finally able to adopt whether or not they're married, or females who
<br>
opt to go the sperm bank route).  Ever hear of the term &quot;broken family?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Broken family&quot; is used to describe any family not fitting that historically
<br>
new but already old model (due to the influence of The Pill, other
<br>
scientific advances in birthing options, and the maturation of our society -
<br>
sadly, the latter mainly due to birth of recent antidiscrimination laws,
<br>
born after a difficult labor evidenced by a lot of kicking and screaming).
<br>
<p>If one penalizes children right from the get-go by insinuating ... ohhhhhh,
<br>
this Johnny or that Mary come from a &quot;broken family,&quot; ohhhhh ... why wonder
<br>
if they may have a difficult time of it?
<br>
<p>As a society we will have to wend our way through this period of transition,
<br>
and concentrate on what can be done to benefit all children - not just the
<br>
ones from the approved family model.  The costs may indeed be tremendous for
<br>
a time, but the benefits may be even more tremendous eventually - and for
<br>
everyone concerned.  In any case, the new emerging mores due in large part
<br>
to to new emerging technologies have opened up many options for people - and
<br>
that's good.  Like it or not ... we AREN'T going back to the old economic
<br>
systems and the daddy-mommy-junior-sis+tuna-casserole-for-dinner &quot;lifestyle&quot;
<br>
(although the latter will surely remain as one option).
