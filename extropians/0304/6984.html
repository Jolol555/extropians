<p>Thanks Hal. Yes, I do remember that thread here now that you mention it.
<br>
Because of your intelligent and negative review of the book in the first
<br>
message of that thread I decided not to read the book or the thread. I
<br>
figured then that I would never read the book.
<br>
<p>It might still be an entertaining read, however. I'll probably read it
<br>
eventually despite what appear to be some valid criticisms by you and
<br>
others. Besides, my girlfriend says I *must* read it. In this case I think I
<br>
should do as I am told. I would very much like to engage my very bright but
<br>
non-extropian girlfriend in a debate about nanotech as she understands it.
