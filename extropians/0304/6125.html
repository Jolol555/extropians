<p>That's a case of damned if you do, damned if you don't.  Traditonally,
<br>
if you were importing from a Third World country, you were accused
<br>
of exploitation.  Now if you don't, you are accused of starving
<br>
their economy.  As usual, I wonder whether it's the same people who
<br>
level opposite accusations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what happens if we invaded another country on the grounds of WMDs and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't find any?
</em><br>
<p>Well, any WMDs were supposed to be well hidden.  It is entirely
<br>
unrealistic to assume that these--if they exist--will be found
<br>
immediately.  And the way it looks, much of the documentation the
<br>
Iraqi government may have had is being carried away or going up in
<br>
flames.  It may take months to come to any definitive conclusion
<br>
regarding the presence of chemical/biological/radiological weapons.

<p><em>&gt; Nasty though his regime is, just what are the numbers associated with it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just what is the total amount of bloodshed, and how does it compare against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things in the world?
</em><br>
<p>A million for the Iraq-Iran war plus a couple of hundred thousands
<br>
for other occasions.
<br>
<p>The ongoing Kongo civil war is said to have killed ~3 million over
<br>
the last four years.
<br>
<p>Malaria is killing a million each year, tuberculosis twice that.

I have an appointment with my doctor about hepatitis A/B shots on
<br>
Monday...
