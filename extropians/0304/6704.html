<em>&gt;&gt; Perhaps you are right.  Of course, the only way to get the right to

<p>I was perhaps a bit too exterme.  You will probably always be able to 
<br>
run &quot;non-trusted&quot; programs, if you jump through enough hoops.  And 
<br>
almost certainly any that you create on your machine using registered 
<br>
copies of MS software will be recognized as &quot;trusted for this machine&quot;.  
<br>
But there will be legal, rather than technical, requirements that 
<br>
prevent you from using those tools to analyse their software.  (And 
<br>
technical restrictions that make it very difficult.)  The effect will be 
<br>
the same, but the illusion of freedom will be less thoroughly disrupted.
<br>
<p>Also, if I read the XP EULA correctly (IANAL), MS is already claiming 
<br>
ownership of any files created with it's programs (sort of... I don't 
<br>
think it's claiming to own the contents), and it's claiming the right to 
<br>
&quot;add, copy, modify, delete, or remove&quot; any of them without notice to the 
<br>
owner of the system.  This was *probably* put in so that they couldn't 
<br>
be sued when their auto-update system scragged a computer, but now that 
<br>
it's there it leads to all sorts of interesting interpretations.  E.g., 
<br>
I believe that under the DMCA it's technically illegal to &quot;use a 
<br>
circumvention measure&quot; (e.g. Open Office) to evade the (sorry, I can't 
<br>
remember the language) to read your own files by anything by an MS 
<br>
program.  This is under my understanding of the XP license.  (I don't 
<br>
own it, and wouldn't agree with it, and it's illegal for anyone to 
<br>
produce a copy for display, so all I have to go on are brief snippets 
<br>
taken out of context.  This means I could likely be wrong.  But I see no 
<br>
reason to give them benefit of the doubt.  They've got a bad history to 
<br>
live down.)
