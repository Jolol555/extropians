<em>&gt;&gt;I am not sure that the U.S. government will be trusted,

<em>&gt;&gt;many years (I am guessing for a generation).

<em>&gt; I wonder if the list would like to consider this question: Given that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States *has* damaged its reputation, what was its reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to start, and what is its reputation now? I don't think it's obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the US's current reputation is any worse than the original.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my mind, the claim that this administration has opened a frightening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new chapter in US foreign policy is a claim that may be overstated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Pre-emption' is nothing more than lawyer's sleight of hand. It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discursive trick used to justify an already agreed-upon course of action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-hoc. It is a claim to have predicted the future with enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainty to justify intervention, and the prediction is not replicable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by anyone else because threat model is classified or based on classfied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence. Justifying a pre-emptive strike without a smoking gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires your audience to believe in your voodoo. The US knows this, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not the right to pre-empt threats they care about. It's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *reputation* for pre-emptive thinking -- the serious consideration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelming responses even when the threat is inchoate -- that the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is cultivating. In the end, the US calculates that achieving this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation in the eyes of the international community will have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterrent effect. Terrorists will lose governmental support, nations may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think twice about pursuing WMD, and so on. But in the end, it's just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterrence, tried and true.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Hmmm.  How is this *not* a frightening new chapter in US foreign 
<br>
policy?  We have struck preemptively so it is not just a matter 
<br>
of posturing.  Why should nations think twice about WMD when 
<br>
having real WMD is the only apparent deterrent to the US 
<br>
preemptively attacking to prevent it?  Witness North Korea.
<br>
<p>I think the US has greatly damaged its reputation ever since the 
<br>
1950s with its clandestine programs to topple and/or control 
<br>
foreign governments.  But the preemptive strike business and the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mass repudiation of treaties and the blanket attack on alleged 
<br>
terrorists and supporters of terrorist and seizure of all 
<br>
assetts at home and abroad without due process is a new and very 
<br>
dangerous deterioration.  Terrorism ia used to justify coming 
<br>
above board with a great number of foreign and domestic dirty 
<br>
tricks and increasing their thoroughness.  The threat is not 
<br>
just to foreign peoples and government but to our own rights and 
<br>
freedom.  The government should be losing the faith of the 
<br>
American people.  I am surprised its reputation does not appear 
<br>
to he deteriorating more rapidly at home.
