<em>&gt;Is this a speculation of yours, or are you relating something

</em><br>
<p>I would recommend Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ for a close
<br>
look at the hunter-gatherer lifestyle including the current state of H-G
<br>
peoples. I think Diamond would agree with Sullivan here. 
<br>
<p>Futhermore, the diet of modern hunter-gatherers cannot be said to
<br>
closely mirror that of our paleolithic ancestors simply by virtue of the
<br>
fact that millenia of agriculture coupled with millenia of importing and
<br>
exporting staple crops, have created enormous, extremely hardy grains
<br>
and roots which now grow wild almost everywhere. The wheat, corn,
<br>
barley, rice, soy, and potatoes of our ancestors were paltry, sickly
<br>
things, with a fraction of the nutritional value of modern wild foods.
<br>
If you want an extropian diet, instead of trying to figure out what
<br>
ancient humans ate (they only lived to be 30 anyway) consider the foods
<br>
of the greatest Western civilizations. A Mediterranean diet is not just
<br>
tasty as hell, but olives, breads, leafy greens, fish, red wine, and
<br>
tons of garlic have been the staples of Mesopotamia, North Africa, and
<br>
Southern Europe for a very long time. On a personal note, this diet has
<br>
likely contributed to the fact that several of my ancestors lived beyond
<br>
a century. Take it or leave it, but it has served me quite well.
