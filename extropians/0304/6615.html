<em>&gt; My point is that in *all* human cultures prior to the last few

</em><br>
<em>&gt; death that we see today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be specific, heart disease, cancer, and stroke combined made up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 80% of deaths in the US last year.  They likely made up less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 10% of deaths in any pre-industrial society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's what this tells us:  the causes of death we now face have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost &quot;invisible&quot; to evolution until just the past few centuries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why I'm dubious that an evolutionary perspective can tell you a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole lot about what kind of diet is going to best stave off heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease or cancer - because heart disease and cancer were virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-existent in human populations until very recently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Here is quote from an old 1950's diet book I was browsing:
<br>
<p>&quot;In 1921 coronary thrombosis was a rarity and accounted for only 746 
<br>
male deaths in Britain. In 1956 the figure was 45,000. It is still going 
<br>
up.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now I don't have figures in front of me, but I would bet that if you 
<br>
calculated the percentage of people over, say, 50 years old who suffered 
<br>
heart attacks in 1921 compared to the percentage in 1956 and beyond you 
<br>
might find a large difference. So I don't believe the argument that we 
<br>
are only seeing this huge rise in that set of diseases because we are 
<br>
living longer is accurate. In 1920 people over 50 simply _did not_ 
<br>
suffer from heart attacks very often at all. Something changed in just a 
<br>
few short decades to make this a much more common event, and so far 
<br>
science has not figured it out.
<br>
<p>It very well could be due to dietary changes- most of which were shifts 
<br>
away from eating traditional/natural foods. There also are some theories 
<br>
that the war we wage on bacteria and other food borne illnesses may also 
<br>
have serious drawbacks... some pathogens actually may have beneficial 
<br>
side effects. Again though, this idea has not really been explored well 
<br>
by scientists even though there is plenty of evidence that traditional 
<br>
cultures used pathogens on purpose to improve their lives.
