<em>&gt; What does follow, however, is that he knows his 4,000,000 year old
</em><br>
paleodiet
<br>
<em>&gt; is the best starting point from which to derive his optimal diet. Indeed
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; is the only starting point, as this is the diet he is currently consuming
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; the time the dairy and grain farmers arrive on the scene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider a more extreme hypothetical to make my point more clear: instead
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; dairy and grain farmers, along come Neolithic &quot;gasoline farmers&quot; who want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him to start drinking gasoline with each meal. Our man Mr. Hugh M.
</em><br>
Species,
<br>
<em>&gt; being an educated man with a rational mind, knows better than to drink
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gasoline without first seeing solid scientific evidence that foods from
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; gasoline farmers are worthwhile additions to the diet. He is skeptical of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the gasoline farmers' claims because 1) he accepts the theory of evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and because 2) he knows he did not evolve on a diet containing gasoline.
</em><br>
He
<br>
<em>&gt; therefore asserts (just I would) that the burden-of-proof is on those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocate a gasoline diet. If the gasoline farmers can't rise to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge by offering solid scientific evidence in favor of gasoline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption then our man won't add gasoline to his diet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the same position I think moderns should take regarding any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-paleo food. Where is the evidence that milk and cheese add anything to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health and longevity? There is none. Likewise with agricultural products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is nothing healthful about these foods that can't be obtained from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more nutrient-dense paleo foods.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but they are yummy and cheap.  Grains, legumes, and dairy
<br>
have been in clinical trials for 10,000 years with no proven side
<br>
effects when consumed in moderation (well a little gas but...).
<br>
If millions of people had been eatting gasoline for thousands of
<br>
years with no obvious ill effects I would give it a try.  And if I
<br>
liked it...  After all this testing the burden of proof really is on
<br>
people saying not to eat grains, legumes and dairy.
<br>
<p><p>I suppose Mr. Hugh M Species would like other species to try
<br>
it first.  For all I know he did start by testing it on his animals.
<br>
Ants and cockroaches approve too.  Species wise grains and
<br>
<p>legumes have been a big win.  Culture wise grain and legume
<br>
eaters have thrived.  They seem to have out competed those who
<br>
<p>did not consume grains and legumes.  Dairy seems to be optional.
