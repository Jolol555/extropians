<p>We know what they did *not* eat and that is the primary determinant of the

paleodiet. We know they did not eat dairy, grains or legumes in any
<br>
significant quantity. We also know they *did* eat meat.

<p><em>&gt; the remains of the period. Many of the things &quot;paleodieters&quot; 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neolithic because they had been gathered in the Mesolithic 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I do not disagree with this nor does it any way contradict paleodiet theory.
<br>
The mesolithic was a short stage between the paleolithic and the neolithic.
<br>
For millions of years prior, grains and legumes were not significant in the
<br>
diet.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Secondly, our paleolithic ancestors, though they managed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive by the Darwinian standards of managing to reproduce, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were hardly what we would call &quot;healthy&quot;. They had short 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifespans and their bodily remains evidence numerous diseases 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and malconditions. 
</em><br>
<p>Archeological evidence of human remains show that paleo peoples were
<br>
healthier than their neolithic progeny. This was discussed previously in the
<br>
thread about diet and evolution. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The history of hominids is one that bounces back and forth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between carnivory, herbivory, and omnivory, like a lot o 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that of mammals in general. That implies to me that our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies are actually probably very flexible about diet. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite flexible, I agree. However the flexibility of our diet does mean
<br>
that just any diet is optimal.
