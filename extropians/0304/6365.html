<p><p><em>&gt; Permit me to observe, in PCR style:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reports of same. One odd thing about a recent report of chemicals found
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; that Lewisite appeared present--this came as a surprise to me and I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspecting a false positive on some other thing, like a pesticide;
</em><br>
Lewisite
<br>
<em>&gt; was kind of primitive even in WWI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;^^^^ According to a book I have on hand on Chemical and Biological warfare,
<br>
Lewisite is &quot;arguably one of the most important CW agents&quot;. and &quot;In later
<br>
stages of World War I, a great effort was made to speed up production at a
<br>
factory near Cleveland, Ohio, but the plant was completed only shortly
<br>
before the war's end. Approximately 150 tons of Lewisite were shipped to
<br>
Europe by the time of the Armistice, but the agent was never used in battle,
<br>
and the supplies were unceremoniously dumped into the ocean&quot;. and
<br>
&quot;Historical evidence has pointed to use of Lewisite by Japanese Imperial
<br>
troops against China during World War II...&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lewisite acts similarly to mustard: &quot;with Lewisite the skin commences
<br>
to redden at the end of 30 minutes; then erythema increases and spreads
<br>
rapidly&quot;.
