I had this post earlier, but suspect, not that my moniker iniated kill-files 
<br>
(which is ok by me) but that the title Penis may have wound up getting nuked, 
<br>
because of the fine work of Faux sexual potency peddlers, flooding our 
<br>
emails.
<br>
<p>C'mon People! This is a very transhumanist-Extropian accomplishment or step. 
<br>
What are you looking at? Its in Revelations, People!  ( 8-| ] or New 
<br>
Scientist, same thing.

<p>Tissue engineers grow penis - with feeling 
<br>
17:00 29 April 03 NewScientist.com news service 
<br>
Tissue engineers who recently demonstrated penis replacement in animals have 
<br>
now
<br>
added a vital missing component - nerve cells.
<br>
&quot;The nerve cells are very important - they are responsible for all the 
<br>
sensory
<br>
function,&quot; says Anthony Atala, at Boston Children's Hospital. &quot;In order to do
<br>
complete [penile] replacements we need to make sure all of the parts are 
<br>
there,
<br>
including the nerves.&quot;
<br>
In September 2002, Atala and his colleagues replaced missing chunks of penis 
<br>
in
<br>
live rabbits with tissues grown in the lab. But the replacement penile 
<br>
tissues
<br>
consisted only of muscle and endothelial cells, which were inserted alongside
<br>
intact nerve cells. Their new work is the first time that penile nerve tissue
<br>
has been regenerated. 
<br>
&quot;This is exciting and extends their work logically in several directions,&quot; 
<br>
says
<br>
reconstructive surgeon Hunter Wessells of the University of Washington School 
<br>
of
<br>
Medicine in Seattle.
<br>
The regeneration of nerves is an important step towards one day creating
<br>
engineered replacement penile tissue for men who have lost parts of the penis
<br>
following prostate cancer surgery or an accident, or to enhance the genitals 
<br>
of
<br>
children born with abnormalities.
