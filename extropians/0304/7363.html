<p>Right, this is what I'm saying. Herbivorous mammals of all kinds tend to
<br>
have massive gastrointestinal tracts (GIT's) relative to their body size. A
<br>
brief trip to the local zoo will show this to be true. Giraffes are another
<br>
fine example that comes to mind. They have long necks to reach the leaves
<br>
and immense GIT's to digest them. 
<br>
<p>Meanwhile straight carnivores like leopards tend to have relatively sleek
<br>
mid-sections. 
<br>
<p>Omnivores like homo sapiens fall in between.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I don't remember monkeys or chimps needing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy fruits and such. 
</em><br>
<p>Go to the zoo next weekend and take another look at the (non-human)
<br>
primates: most of them do in fact have large GIT's and bloated mid-sections,
<br>
relative to humans. Gorillas are not the only primate with a large gut,
<br>
though perhaps because of their large over-all size one tends to notice them
<br>
more. Take a look at the baboons, as a perfect example, and of course the
<br>
chimps as well. The bellies of lower primates tend to protrude outward
<br>
because of their large GIT's (not because of fat as is the case for their
<br>
homo sapien visitors at the zoo :)
