<em>&gt;&gt;The reason for the new system is pretty much as they

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Conrad told me then, the only likely solution that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;will enable a high-tech civilization to survive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;long-term is universal surveillance.  Check out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;flood of &quot;tranparency&quot;  sites that have recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;emerged, following Brin's book.  Same idea.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;alternative - that there is no solution - resolves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Fermi's hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess the website that I am part of would have to be one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; websites!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is <a href="http://www.universaltransparency.org">http://www.universaltransparency.org</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I have obviously given this great thought, and I think that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably some midway point that would work. For example, one of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible implementations would be a society where there was great Universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transparency wherever there are advanced technologies like nano or biotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even some easier techs. But from there, we could have refuges where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy was respected to different levels. For example, a commons where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone enters and is checked at the door, like nightclubs today where they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have metal detectors. Inside this common area, most anything goes, the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are liberal, and there are places where there are no cameras. Perhaps we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would live in apartments that have a private room that we can take nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into that could be weaponized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As often is the case, both sides will probably need to compromise. Privacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocates have to realize that privacy can be abused, transparency advocates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the general public (like 80% of Americans, who have &quot;nothing to hide&quot; )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to appreciate that privacy is not just used to hide illegal things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I think that if laws were rewritten to decriminalize and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destigmatize sex, drugs, gambling and other personal choice issues, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency would be much easier to implement. Of course, the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration is moving in the other direction, so that is not too good a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sign! Even if these laws were rewritten, there are other reasons for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy, or other concerns that need to be addressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The main problem I see it today is that privacy advocates are not willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give an inch on privacy, but whether we like it or not, the police state is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming. Rather than fight it, we should work to make it fair and just, as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a train that we cannot stop, nor should we as it serves a purpose, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch Terrorists etc.
</em><br>
<p><p>If the police state is coming &quot;whether we like it or not&quot; then 
<br>
universal transparency (universal surveillance) has serious 
<br>
problems as you partially touched upon.  These include:
<br>
<p>1) It will not be universal in that the powers that be will not 
<br>
be subject to it.  Look how easily the current US administration 
<br>
threw out or ignores many existing oversight laws.
<br>
<p>2) There is no clear way to force compliance, especially on the 
<br>
part of government;
<br>
<p>3) Universal surveillance = Universal Enforcement/Control - 
<br>
there is no way to &quot;opt out&quot; of bad law if surveillance is 
<br>
total.  There is no way to do an uprising against an unjust 
<br>
government as it will be seen and squashed in its weak/early 
<br>
stages so
<br>
<p>4) Universal surveillance = universal stagnation - besides the 
<br>
above the laws will most likely be made by powered interests 
<br>
and/or the people and/or arbitrary doctrines (theocracy anyone). 
<br>
Universal surveillance would be workable only if all humans, at 
<br>
least all decision makers were enlightened.  This is clearly not 
<br>
the case and not doable.  Given democracy + universal 
<br>
surveillance the result is a lowest common denominator effect of 
<br>
allowed behavior.  Any group that fears any change/innovation 
<br>
and can sway the deciding parties gets to dictate to all.  Where 
<br>
will radical innovation and change come from in such a state?
<br>
<p>There is nothing &quot;fair and just&quot; about a police state.  Not ever.
