<p>That's the clue. Gelernter is an observant Orthodox Jew, I understand. See.

e.g. in Commentary, 2002:

m=judaism
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What is Judaism? The main topics are familiar: God and man; the people
<br>
Israel; Torah and mitzvot, or
<br>
&nbsp;divine commands; prayer, the Sabbath, and the yearly cycle of sacred
<br>
ritual. The great themes of Jewish
<br>
&nbsp;history are likewise familiar: exodus and liberation, chosenness and
<br>
revelation, exile and redemption,
<br>
&nbsp;community and peoplehood. But some of Judaism's most important themes are
<br>
unfamiliar, because, like
<br>
&nbsp;musical phrases or fragrances, they can only be described imperfectly in
<br>
words.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What is Judaism? It is one continuous sacred text, founded on the written
<br>
Torah (or Bible) and the
<br>
&nbsp;spoken Torah (or Talmud), continuing through several millennia's worth of
<br>
discussion and commentary
<br>
&nbsp;laid in translucent leaves over the foundation. One generation's work of
<br>
study and understanding never
<br>
&nbsp;obscures, only colors, the previous generation's. Israel developed its
<br>
religion by successive glazes. You
<br>
&nbsp;are always catching glimpses--as if you were a scuba diver gazing downward
<br>
at submerged ancient
<br>
&nbsp;cities--of older worlds beneath the surface. But you swim not in water but
<br>
in voices: the Lord's voice
<br>
&nbsp;upon the waters of Psalm 29; the voice of the shofar, in which mankind
<br>
addresses its most urgent
<br>
&nbsp;messages to God; the still, small voice that the prophet Elijah hears on
<br>
Mt. Horeb; the dark voice of
<br>
&nbsp;Jewish history, the &quot;voice of your brother's blood&quot; crying out from the
<br>
earth; and the intertwined voices
<br>
&nbsp;of unbridled joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the
<br>
bride--the sound of God's presence
<br>
&nbsp;in the universe.
<br>
<p>Evidently that sound tells us not to meddle in things Man was not meant to
<br>
know or do.
<br>
<p>Sigh.
<br>
