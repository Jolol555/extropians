I suspect very strongly that you are wrong.  If I have read the specs 
<br>
correctly, it could easily &quot;loose&quot; documents.  And also create documents 
<br>
that could not be read after a certain date, more than so many time, if 
<br>
some particular file (key) were changed.  Etc.  It could be very useful 
<br>
to those who wanted to create documents that could only be read under 
<br>
certain specified conditions.  (Well, so could many other techniques.  
<br>
Nothing new here, really.)  So to me it looks more like the opposite of 
<br>
what you are claiming.
<br>
<p>I haven't yet seen any advantage to the &quot;owner&quot; of the hardware.  
<br>
&quot;owner&quot; is in quotes, because I don't think that you can really be 
<br>
considered to own something that you can't use.  Unless, that is, you 
<br>
think that a new way of rendering your documents unreadable is desireable.
<br>
<p>What is does do is create an really nifty way for some company that 
<br>
sells a OS (or other software) to rig things you that if you don't 
<br>
upgrade your software at the appropriate time, not only can you not read 
<br>
them on your computer, but you can't read them on any other, either.  
<br>
But then a certain software company is already essentially claiming to 
<br>
own any documents that you create using their software, if you actually 
<br>
read the EULA.  So it's not your documents that you can't read.  And 
<br>
it's already illegal to distribute or use any &quot;circumvention&quot; measure.
