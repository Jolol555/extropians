<p>Pasadena institutions meet at
<br>
the intersection of art, science, and engineering 
<br>
<p>A collaboration between two Pasadena institutions -- California Institute
<br>
of Technology and Art Center College of Design -- is investigating new
<br>
aesthetic possibilities at the intersection of art, science, and
<br>
engineering. 
<br>
<p>Organized by Caltech's National Science Foundation (NSF) Center for
<br>
Neuromorphic Systems Engineering (CNSE) and Art Center's Alyce de Roulet
<br>
Williamson Gallery, the project connects six contemporary artists with the
<br>
knowledge and technology resources of CNSE. The results of this year-long
<br>
collaboration will be documented in NEURO, an exhibition and publication
<br>
scheduled to commence on both campuses in April, 2003. 
<br>
<p>At CNSE, scientists and engineers are working to translate our
<br>
understanding of biologic systems into a new class of electronic devices
<br>
that imitate the ways humans and animals sense and make sense of the world.
<br>
The ultimate goal of CNSE researchers is to enable the machines of the
<br>
future to interact with, learn from, and adapt to their environment with a
<br>
flexibility equivalent to that of living creatures. The Center's work is
<br>
cross-fertilized by researchers in a wide variety of fields, including
<br>
systems neurophysiology, psychophysics, computational neurobiology,
<br>
microelectronics and micromachining, optoelectronics, learning theory and
<br>
pattern recognition, control, locomotion, sensory-driven autonomous
<br>
behavior and systems. The main testbeds of the center are human-machine
<br>
interfaces, autonomous vehicles and neuroprosthetics. 
<br>
<p>According to Center director and Caltech Professor Pietro Perona, &quot;The
<br>
National Science Foundation encourages us to make our science and
<br>
technology accessible to everyone. Through the work of talented artists we
<br>
can reach people who may feel intimidated by our scientific lingo. We also
<br>
hope to be able to look at our work with new eyes: artists can provide us
<br>
with fresh insight into the meaning of what we do.&quot; Perona, whose
<br>
investigations are in human vision, has studied the way in which artists
<br>
organize visual material as part of his research. 
<br>
<p>At Art Center, Williamson Gallery director Stephen Nowlin has emphasized
<br>
the common borderlines of art and science through a decade-long series of
<br>
crossover exhibitions. Artists who use digital and interactive technology
<br>
in their work have been featured in such shows as &quot;Digital Mediations&quot;
<br>
(1995), &quot;Telematic Connections&quot; (2001), and &quot;GHz: The Post-Analog Object in
<br>
L.A.&quot; (2002), while the subject of mathematics was surveyed in Charles and
<br>
Ray Eames' &quot;Mathematica&quot; (2000) and astronomical observations by
<br>
artist/astronomer Russell Crotty formed the gallery's contribution to the
<br>
2001 city-wide &quot;Universe&quot; festival. 
<br>
<p>Says Nowlin, &quot;Science and technology are undermining many of our
<br>
established social and intellectual conventions, and as a result human
<br>
culture is moving toward new definitions and opportunities, as well as
<br>
dilemmas. Such a nexus of change always beckons artists, and the
<br>
collaborative nature of this project will combine contemporary science and
<br>
art into works that are uniquely about and of this new century.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
<p>Worldwide, a number of institutions have begun to embrace the work of
<br>
artists whose departure from the tenets of 20th Century modernism is marked
<br>
by their employment of new computer-based technologies and, in particular,
<br>
by sensory modes that allow spectators and artworks to interact. Some of
<br>
this &quot;media art&quot; received its first level of support from computer
<br>
trade-shows, and was only slowly acknowledged in art museums and
<br>
educational institutions. Now, a number of museums and galleries are
<br>
recognizing that just as art changed drastically in response to the
<br>
Industrial Revolution and scientific discoveries at the end of the 19th
<br>
Century, so too is art changing as a function of the startling developments
<br>
leading from the late 20th century's digital revolution to 21st century
<br>
science. Beyond technology itself, artists are engaging with newly emerging
<br>
social and intellectual implications as science questions many of
<br>
humankind's fundamental perceptions and conventions of thought. 
<br>
<p>To accommodate this new art, hybrid institutions have begun to emerge such
<br>
as ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany, ARS Electronica Museum, in Linz, Austria, the
<br>
InterCommunication Center (ICC) in Tokyo, Eyebeam in New York, and
<br>
Hexagram, in Montreal, all institutions that merge the study of culture and
<br>
technology with new developments in art and science. And, as noted in the
<br>
March/April 2002 issue of &quot;Museum News,&quot; the journal of the American
<br>
Association of Museums, Art Center's Williamson Gallery is among a handful
<br>
of &quot;early adopter&quot; institutions that have embraced the enterprise of
<br>
art/science/technology, including also New York's Guggenheim Museum, the
<br>
Whitney Museum of American Art, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and
<br>
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. 
<br>
<p>While largely the product of affordable computer-based technologies that
<br>
are also dramatically affecting worldwide change, the current art/science
<br>
interface is preceded by a longer history, one extending at least to the
<br>
late 1960s and the worldwide Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.)
<br>
movement originated by artist Robert Rauschenberg and engineer Billy
<br>
Kluver. Caltech had its own version of E.A.T. in the early 70s, and was
<br>
host to a number of artist/scientist pairings. In a sense, the NEURO
<br>
project is a return to that moment of inspiration from over thirty years
<br>
ago, when it was acknowledged that a spark of unexpected creativity can
<br>
result for both art and science if each discipline is encouraged to
<br>
stimulate the other. 
<br>
<p><p>NEURO is supported in part by the Engineering Research Centers Program of
<br>
the National Science Foundation under Award Number EEC-9402726, through the
<br>
Center for Neuromorphic Systems Engineering at the California Institute of
<br>
Technology. 
<br>
<p>Williamson Gallery exhibitions are funded in part by grants from the
<br>
Pasadena Art Alliance and The Virginia Steele Scott Foundation.
