<em>&gt; Harvey and Lee raise some very interesting points vis-a-vis whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleportation has to use the same atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Lee then said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was astonished early last year to learn that some highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent and thoughtful list members will not teleport.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is, on my &quot;Seven Levels of Identity&quot;, they are at level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My conclusion is that Harvey &amp; Lee know different sets of people.
</em><br>
<p>It could be.  I don't think that I have heard anybody on the Extropians list
<br>
claim that we need to retain our same atoms to retain identity.  I think
<br>
this is a common misunderstanding that one side assumes for the other side.
<br>
Does anybody claim this viewpoint for themselves?
<br>
<p>The soul references are similar.  I have seen both sides explain why the
<br>
&quot;other&quot; side must believe in a soul to explain their objection.  But I don't
<br>
know anybody who claims this view for themselves.
<br>
<p>I think there is a lot of misconceptions about what the &quot;other&quot; side thinks.
<br>
Most of the arguments in this debate prove something that the other side
<br>
doesn't care about.  It argues against points the other side doesn't
<br>
believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think one problem with these levels is that they seem to presume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the retention of the current concept of an &quot;individual&quot;.  In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jupiter Brain or a Matrioshka Brain one's &quot;individuality&quot; may become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so interconnected with the &quot;collective&quot; that it becomes relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult or impossible to teleport an individual at all.
</em><br>
<p>This is where semantics comes in.  We are facing new situations that have
<br>
never occurred before.  Questions about identity, individualism, and the
<br>
like beg the question of what these terms mean when copies, backups,
<br>
distributions, and collectives are possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee continues:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I claim that this decision rests with owner of the resources,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps just the owner of the atoms involved.  For example, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone came to me and wanted to be teleported to New York, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; insisted that he would permit me to gratify his wish only if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also arranged for the destruction of the original, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reluctantly agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But it *is* a dumb waste, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, not if its Lee -- one copy is *completely* sufficient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :-)
</em><br>
<p>Sufficient for what?  One copy of Lee is sufficient to continue the
<br>
situation of having one Lee.  But after you have made two copies of Lee,
<br>
there are more possibilities.  Two copies can go in two directions and do
<br>
more things.  Two Lees are better than one.  Now that we have these
<br>
additional possibilities, destroying one Lee is a loss.  Going back to one
<br>
Lee reduces the mobility of Lee, the total brain matter of Lee, the number
<br>
of hands Lee can use, the number of places Lee can visit concurrently, etc.
<br>
<p>Saying that the one Lee at the end is equivalent to the one Lee at the
<br>
beginning ignores the additional Lee in the meantime.  It is like saying I
<br>
have no children now, I can produce children, kill them, and everything ends
<br>
up like it was before.  Some would claim that nothing is lost, but once
<br>
these individuals exist, it is a loss when they cease to exist.
<br>
<p>The real question seems to boil down to whether anyone would value a
<br>
duplicate copy.  Many people seem to be assuming that after there is one
<br>
Lee, another Lee is useless.  I don't share that view.  I would love to be
<br>
able to duplicate myself and have an exact copy with my viewpoints and
<br>
history to help me work on my projects.  I would greatly value additional
<br>
copies as useful persons.  A loss of any of these after they were created
<br>
would be a loss.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The core problem is that most people do not realize that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are both the original and the copy, in a peculiar way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evidently we haven't been prepared by evolution to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intuitively.  Duplicates are self.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep.  This is the heart of the problem.  We just don't have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frame of reference for dealing with copies of ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.  :-)
<br>
<p>I keep insisting that I agree that after a copy operation, both copies are
<br>
&quot;me&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; am both copies.  I still don't want any of &quot;me&quot; killed.  I
<br>
would no more want a copy destroyed just because it is a duplicate, than I
<br>
would give up one of my arms on the theory that I already have another one.
<br>
I can do more with more copies.  You are assuming that I don't believe the
<br>
other copy is &quot;me&quot;, which is why I won't suicide my original.  But even when
<br>
I agree, it does not change my position.
