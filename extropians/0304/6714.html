<p>I don't follow where this one was hypocrisy.  
<br>
&quot;Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, vice director of
<br>
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the war
<br>
crime is determined by what the soldier does as well
<br>
as what he wears.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Seems reasonable enough, if you're dressing like the
<br>
locals, then slaughter them:  war crime.  If you dress
<br>
like them, and obtain information, espionage.  Right? 
<br>
And I suppose one could dress like them, and try to
<br>
spurn a revolution which is traitorous, or perhaps try
<br>
to free some captives, which is heroic.  And so on.
<br>
<p>Of course we can't fully know which standard covert US
<br>
troops represent, but that falls under the old adage,
<br>
&quot;who will guard the guards&quot;, an entirely different
<br>
issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. In northern Iraq, U.S. forces set up bases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools, while the Pentagon continues to ... well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know the rest.
</em><br>

<br>
<p>This of course I'd agree is hypocritical.  And I
<br>
wonder why mention &quot;near a prominent Christian
<br>
church&quot;?  They did they same thing on all the major
<br>
media outlets when in [Basra?] they bombed a building
<br>
where Fedayeen were supposed to have been meeting, and
<br>
raved how with accuracy the Christian church nearby
<br>
was left untouched.  I also recall another mention of
<br>
a Christian church being unharmed although it wasn't
<br>
touted nearly as much as the first so I don't recall
<br>
the context.
