</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't believe it has been shown to do so.. at least to my satisfaction.

<em>&gt; I don't see any problem with the conclusions in that article: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;As to why the Western-style of diet might increase colon cancer risk, Fung
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said it might be a combination of factors. Processed meats and red meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooked at high temperatures contain chemicals that can increase cancer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk,...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is exactly my point. &quot;Processed meats and red meat cooked at high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperatures contain chemicals that increase cancer risk.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it is all circular logic. The study itself did not control that 
<br>
one variable. Rather it simply showed that eating a &quot;Western-style diet&quot; 
<br>
consisting of many other potentially damaging types of food raised the 
<br>
risk of colon cancer. If you looked at that other beyondveg link I sent, 
<br>
the table from that study showed a probably decreased risk of colon 
<br>
cancer in those who cooked their food the most.
<br>
<p>So IMO the whole HCA thing is likely overblown, possibly even 
<br>
nonexistent in terms of a health threat. I think something more 
<br>
interesting is this article in the May issue of LEF magazine regarding 
<br>
how overcooked foods are higher in AGEs (&quot;glycotoxins&quot;), and a study 
<br>
published last November showing how eating foods high in AGEs may 
<br>
increase their levels in your body along with an increase in 
<br>
corresponding inflamation response.
<br>
<p>Even with that though there is some tradeoff... limiting fats and meats 
<br>
from your diet to avoid this new problem will mean you will find 
<br>
yourself eating carby foods more likely to generate glucose spikes in 
<br>
your blood which in turn also help generate higher amounts of 
<br>
glycotoxins. It appears the perfect diet is still elusive....
