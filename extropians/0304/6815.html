Concerning the important role of laboratory testing in
<br>
helping us understand proper diet:

</em><br>
<p>Actually that is what I mean by the paleodiet 
<br>
being the null or default hypothesis. To those like
<br>
you and me who see validity to the idea that the
<br>
healthiest foods are paleothic foods because we are
<br>
best adapted to those foods, the paleodiet appears to
<br>
be a good working hypothesis, and should be considered
<br>
the null hypothesis which must be rejected in any
<br>
statistical test about diet. This would mean that the
<br>
the &quot;burden of proof&quot; would indeed be on those
<br>
researchers who would like to formulate and test any
<br>
hypothesis that deviates from the default paleodiet
<br>
working hypothesis.
<br>
<p>This is just basic Stat 101. Perhaps Harvey
<br>
understands the idea also, and is objecting to the
<br>
&quot;burden of proof&quot; concept simply because it might seem
<br>
offensive in a verbal debate with someone who has no
<br>
knowledge of statistics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's not playing  burden-of-proof tennis, 
</em><br>
<p>Burden-of-proof tennis is exactly what scientific
<br>
researchers do. It is what fuels scientific progress.
<br>
Most scientists are not paid well; other than the
<br>
simple pursuit of knowledge their motivation in life
<br>
is to obtain prestige amongst their peers in academia.
<br>
Prestige comes from publishing papers that establish
<br>
themselves as researchers who successfully advance
<br>
scientific knowlege by formulating, testing, and
<br>
validating new competing hypotheses that reject old
<br>
working (null) hypotheses. The most successful and
<br>
reputable researchers glady take the statistical
<br>
burden-of-proof upon their shoulders while also
<br>
remaining *experimentally* unbiased and objective.
<br>
<p>An exception to hypothesis-testing research is
<br>
&quot;exploratory research,&quot; which is not an attempt to
<br>
support or reject any particular hypothesis. Much of
<br>
the medical research we see in databases like Medline
<br>
is exploratory research. People who've forgotten or
<br>
who never took Stat 101 commonly misinterpet such
<br>
studies. Probably you and Harvey know the difference
<br>
but for those who don't know I'll make up a simple
<br>
idealized example of exploratory research:
<br>
<p>Researcher Jones wonders what adding large amounts of
<br>
Nutrient A to the diet of rats will do to 20 various
<br>
blood parameters related to health, and decides to do
<br>
some exporatory research. For a period of 30 days he
<br>
adds large amounts of Nutrient A to the diet of 50
<br>
rats and the same amount of a placebo substance to the
<br>
diets of 50 control rats. At the end of 30 days he
<br>
measures 20 blood parameters of interest in all 100
<br>
rats. Parameter #4 is found to have increased by a
<br>
statistically significant degree in the rats on the
<br>
high Nutrient A diet, such that the difference in
<br>
Parameter #4 vs the control rats is different with
<br>
statistical significance p &lt; .05 (meaning that there
<br>
is only a 5% or lower probability that the means of
<br>
the parameter in the two populations from which the
<br>
samples were taken are actually the same, i.e., that
<br>
we can say with 95% confidence that the seemingly
<br>
large difference is not just due to sampling error).
<br>
He then reports this seemimgly amazing result in a
<br>
major medical journal. 
<br>
<p>A common mistake is to conclude from Jones' research
<br>
that adding Nutrient A to the diet of rats is likely
<br>
to cause an increase in Parameter #4.
<br>
<p>As any statistician knows, no such conclusion can be
<br>
made, because the exploratory researcher did not FIRST
<br>
explicity define both 1) a null hypothesis, and 2) a
<br>
competing hypothesis concerning the effects of
<br>
Nutrient A on Parameter #4. 
<br>
<p>To draw any conclusions, another study must be
<br>
performed in which these two hypothesis are defined
<br>
explicitly prior to the experiment. For example
<br>
reseacher Smith, a subscriber to that same medical
<br>
journal, might read about reseacher Jones' exploratory
<br>
research concerning Nutrient A. Intrigued by Jones'
<br>
results he might then decide to find grant money to
<br>
perform the critical experiment to determine if
<br>
Nutrient A actually causes an increase in Parameter
<br>
#4. He will perform an experiment similar to Jones'
<br>
experiment, with the critical difference being that he
<br>
will first define precisely the hypothesis he is
<br>
testing. He must define two hypotheses:
<br>
<p>The Null Hypothesis: 
<br>
&quot;Nutrient A has no effect on Parameter #4.&quot;
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>The Competing Hypothesis: 
<br>
&quot;Nutrient A causes Parameter #4 to increase.&quot;
<br>
<p>His study will be hideously biased unless he defines
<br>
both these hypotheses explicitly *before* conducting
<br>
the experiment.
<br>
<p>The reason we cannot rely on Jones' exploratory
<br>
research is that he measured 20 parameters without
<br>
first defining the null and competing hypotheses for
<br>
any particular one of them. Statistically speaking if
<br>
the 20 parameters are more or less independent random
<br>
variables then the probability is that about 1 of the
<br>
20 parameters (5% of them) should have deviated enough
<br>
to have been found statistically significant at the
<br>
95% confidence level just by pure random chance alone.
