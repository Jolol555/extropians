<em>&gt; Hard to say -- I'm not that familiar with either the AD or PD

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>### The debate on whether protein aggregation is causal in AD and PD is
<br>
raging as we speak. I am on the side of doubters, and I think misaggregation
<br>
merely amplifies other problems, mainly the accumulated mtDNA mutations.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Recently it turned out that APP has a direct toxic effect on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mitochondria, and mutant alpha-synuclein has also been implicated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; diminished mito function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could see some strange protein aggregation function clogging up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitochondrial transport proteins -- APP is only a few dozen amino
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acids I think.  The mitochondrial transport proteins have to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty darn large pore sizes to get all of the mito proteins inside.
</em><br>
<p>### There are four different mitochondrial protein transport systems. Quite
<br>
complex, yes.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that is the case -- or some other process degrades mitochondrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function then it seems likely that one will get either a shortage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ATP (that's bad for protein synthesis *and* breakdown) or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the production of more free radicals (though improper protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function)
</em><br>
<p>### Indeed, there is diminished complex IV activity in AD (discovered by my
<br>
boss, Davis Parker), and increased production of free radicals, although I
<br>
do not know if diminished levels of ATP have been observed as well.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Also, are protein aggregates in AD and PD really lysosomal, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cytoplasmic (or even extracellular)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A think APP starts out cytoplasmic but is supposed to get exported to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the cell membrane or even outside the cell but a lot can happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutant proteins on the way to the forum.  E.g. if the mutation is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the signal sequence controlling transport and ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destination things could get really screwed up. [I think I've heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; George Martin state that there is a polymorphism in the signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence (not perhaps a &quot;mutation&quot; per se) of the Werner's Syndrome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein -- that might have a very interesting effects by impacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rate of transport of the newly synthesized protein into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nucleus and therefore the quantity available impacting the rates of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA copying, transcription, etc. (it isn't fully clear I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly when and where the WS protein is functioning) and further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downstream the overall &quot;rate&quot; of aging.]
</em><br>
<p>### I meant some scepticism as to the usefulness of improving the digestion
<br>
of protein aggregates by lysosomes. AFAIK, AD and PD are not really
<br>
lysosomal disorders, although in PD there is indeed some impairment of the
<br>
proteasome.

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Is there any indication that lipofuscin is indeed causally involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in cell death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not so sure it is &quot;cell death&quot; -- sufficient #'s of double strand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaks will activate the apoptosis progam (and human cells are a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less tolerant of double strand breaks than mouse cells -- perhaps a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major reason they get cancer sooner even though they have many fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells).
</em><br>
<p>### Apoptosis is a final common fate for a number of processes. The
<br>
apoptosis we observe in PD cybrids is not related to double strand breaks.
<br>
Same applies to apoptosis in intact tissue, although the process as only
<br>
recently been observed.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cell death *is* part of the process -- those cells that decide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergo apoptosis had better be replaced by stem cells -- otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are just going to fade away.  I suspect there is a delicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance between underactive stem cells -- so you don't heal as fast,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradually lose functional capacity, etc. and overactive stem cells --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially posed to turn into various forms of cancer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The data, for at least many cell types, I believe suggests that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lipofuscin accumulates with age -- thus the recycling ability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lysosomes containing lipofuscin (or perhaps cytoplasmic lipofuscin)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumably declines and the cells may compensate by making more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lysosomes -- thus the cells fill up with lysosomes containing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lipofuscin (or perhaps merely lipofuscin itself).  This is supported
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the fact that the cells effectively lose water content with age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (more lipofuscin, more lysosomes = less water). So if the cells are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling up with lipofuscin/lysosomes there is less and less space for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mitochondria that you need to generate the energy the cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires -- thus &quot;Energy Catastrophe&quot;.  The increasing density of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell probably also slows down transport processes to the cell surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or protein export.  That certainly has to have some negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences.
</em><br>
<p>### PD and AD cybrids have impaired mito function despite never having any
<br>
of the lipofuscin transferred during their production, so it appears that
<br>
the basic defect is in the mitos themselves, although one cannot exclude the
<br>
possibility that lipofuscin makes the whole situation worse.

<em>&gt; I had the mtDNA-transfer to the nucleus idea probably 7-8 years ago. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't remember whether I came up with it. It may have come from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical paper that I read.  Aubrey de Grey I think figured it out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently and has worked on it a bit more and I think he thinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its a bit tricky because the human mtDNA proteins that are currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still in the mtDNA are a bit hydrophobic and so transport and getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them across the membranes may be difficult.

</em><br>

<br>
<p>Mitochondria import from the cytoplasm the vast majority of proteins and
<br>
some RNAs. Although there exists extended knowledge concerning the
<br>
mechanisms of protein import, the import of RNA is poorly understood. It was
<br>
almost exclusively studied on the model of tRNA import, in several
<br>
protozoans, plants and yeast. Mammalian mitochondria, which do not import
<br>
tRNAs naturally, are hypothesized to import other small RNA molecules from
<br>
the cytoplasm. We studied tRNA import in the yeast system, both in vitro and
<br>
in vivo, and applied similar approaches to study 5S rRNA import into human
<br>
mitochondria. Despite the obvious divergence of RNA import systems suggested
<br>
for different species, we find that in yeast and human cells this pathway
<br>
involves similar mechanisms exploiting cytosolic proteins to target the RNA
<br>
to the organelle and requiring the integrity of pre-protein import
<br>
apparatus. The import pathway might be of interest from a biomedical point
<br>
of view, to target into mitochondria RNAs that could suppress pathological
<br>
mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Yeast represents a good model to elaborate
<br>
such a gene therapy approach. We have described here the various approaches
<br>
and protocols to study RNA import into mitochondria of yeast and human cells
<br>
in vitro and in vivo.

Rescue of a mitochondrial deficiency causing Leber Hereditary Optic
<br>
Neuropathy.[comment].
<br>
Annals of Neurology. 52(5):534-42, 2002 Nov.
<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
A G to A transition at nucleotide 11778 in the ND4 subunit gene of complex I
<br>
was the first point mutation in the mitochondrial genome linked to a human
<br>
disease. It causes Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, a disorder with
<br>
oxidative phosphorylation deficiency. To overcome this defect, we made a
<br>
synthetic ND4 subunit compatible with the &quot;universal&quot; genetic code and
<br>
imported it into mitochondria by adding a mitochondrial targeting sequence.
<br>
For detection we added a FLAG tag. This gene was inserted in an
<br>
adeno-associated viral vector. The ND4FLAG protein was imported into the
<br>
mitochondria of cybrids harboring the G11778A mutation, where it increased
<br>
their survival rate threefold, under restrictive conditions that forced the
<br>
cells to rely predominantly on oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.
<br>
Since assays of complex I activity were normal in G11778A cybrids we focused
<br>
on changes in ATP synthesis using complex I substrates. The G11778A cybrids
<br>
showed a 60% reduction in the rate of ATP synthesis. Relative to
<br>
mock-transfected G11778A cybrids, complemented G11778A cybrids showed a
<br>
threefold increase in ATP synthesis, to a level indistinguishable from that
<br>
in cybrids containing normal mitochondrial DNA. Restoration of respiration
<br>
by allotopic expression opens the door for gene therapy of Leber Hereditary
<br>
Optic Neuropathy

<br>
<p>Actually, only two mt proteins have *not* been found in the nucleus in one
<br>
organism or the other. Possibly the reason for stability of the mtDNA in
<br>
evolution is not the protein import problem, but the difference in the
<br>
nuclear and mito genetic code. Even if your cyt b gene is transferred to the
<br>
nucleus (as happened many times, even in humans, as shown by nuclear mito
<br>
pseudogenes), it will be transcribed into a non-functional protein because
<br>
the interpreting machinery (the tRNA code) is different.
<br>
<p><p>----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The short summary is that there are a number of ways to tackle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this problem.  The pain in the rear end problem that we really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to solve is what the heck in the mitochondrial transport
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chain is generating the free radicals in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every time I hear a talk on this topic it gives me a headache
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to the complexity.
