<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Originaly I was referring to Egypts non-military aide, but I did not relay
<br>
as much as I did not, at the time, have the time to dig up the information.
<br>
So are you agreeing than the Egypt is the single biggest reciepient of
<br>
non-military aide?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>And, as Brendan neglected to note; the receipient of the &quot;greater&quot; amount 
<br>
isn't having its populace howling in the streets against America. I suspect 
<br>
that the receipient of the greater amount also doesn't have a government 
<br>
controlled press either :-)  Talk about money down the tubes. We help feed 
<br>
them and they still hate our guts; which sadly is probably how the iraqis 
<br>
will do unto us also. Talk about gratitude, sigh! 
<br>
<p>The main reason we went into Iraq (me thinks) is not oil, nor liberation, but 
<br>
effectively defanging a regime who was likely (in the opinion of many, not 
<br>
all) to secretly pass-off some biological goodies to Al Qeida, or some other 
<br>
happy team, which would, in the fullness of time, find use against American 
<br>
civilians.
