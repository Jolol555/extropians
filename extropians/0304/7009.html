<p><em>&gt; ### Do you think that protein aggregation is causative in sporadic AD

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it turned out that APP has a direct toxic effect on mitochondria, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutant alpha-synuclein has also been implicated in diminished mito
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function.
</em><br>
<p>It's still very unclear what the major pathogenic process is in AD or
<br>
PD, but the various aggregates seem to be the only options, because
<br>
nothing else has been identified that changes in affected cells (either
<br>
with age or faster in the disease than in normal aging).  The effect on
<br>
mitochondria is interesting, but basically I think that we can be sure
<br>
that these aggregates are bad for us, so let's get rid of them, rather
<br>
than wasting time worrying about precisely how they're bad for us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, are protein aggregates in AD and PD really lysosomal, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cytoplasmic (or even extracellular)?
</em><br>
<p>In AD, the Abeta aggregates (plaques) are extracellular but can be made
<br>
lysosomal by vaccination (Elan's work, etc).  Vaccination makes microglia
<br>
engulf (endocytose) bits of plaque.  It thereby becomes lysosomal.  As
<br>
for tau (tangles) in AD and alpha-synuclein in PD, the evidence that it
<br>
is lysosomal is limited but positive: see eg Neurosci Lett 284:187 or Mol
<br>
Cell Neurosci 18:702.  It would be very surprising if it weren't, because
<br>
the stuff is clearly accumulating to the detriment of the cell.  In some
<br>
neurodegenerative diseases there seem to be nuclear aggregates, but that
<br>
is very much the exception.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Atheromas are not aggregates of lysosomally indigestible material, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving cellular digestion is not likely to be of help.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  First, plaques develop from foam cells, which are macrophages
<br>
that have endocytosed modified LDL in the artery wall and failed to
<br>
digest it all, which is why they became foam cells.  Second, in a mature
<br>
plaque there is a constant influx of new macrophages that enter it for
<br>
the purpose of breaking down the core, and they engulf bits of it, but
<br>
they can't break it down so they die and become part of the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there any indication that lipofuscin is indeed causally involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell death?
</em><br>
<p>The in vitro evidence is now quite compelling -- see recent papers by
<br>
Brunk and Terman.  In vivo evidence is still rather lacking.  Currently
<br>
I'm more focused on the age-related diseases (above), for this reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, I agree that the best way of fighting aging is reversing it by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic engineering (once you get it to work). I like your idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transferring mtDNA-encoded function to the nucleus. Any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information on this project?
</em><br>
<p>It's going very well in terms of the underlying science but it badly
<br>
needs more funding.  The most important recent advance is the cloning
<br>
of four genes from Chlamydomonas that are mt-coded in animals but
<br>
nuclear in Chlamydomonas.  These genes have undergone subtle changes to
<br>
make the proteins slightly less hydrophobic (hence more importable),
<br>
and we should be able to emulate those changes (in all our 13 mt-coded
<br>
proteins, not just those four).

<p><em>&gt; First you have to get genetic engineering *cheap* and *fast) (that I'm

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No need here, really -- the hydrophobicity problem can be studied in
<br>
vitro quite efficiently enough with existing technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I had the mtDNA-transfer to the nucleus idea probably 7-8 years ago. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't remember whether I came up with it. It may have come from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical paper that I read.  Aubrey de Grey I think figured it out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently and has worked on it a bit more and I think he thinks its a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit tricky because the human mtDNA proteins that are currently still in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mtDNA are a bit hydrophobic and so transport and getting them across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the membranes may be difficult.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, many people have thought of this independently (it's not a very
<br>
hard idea to think of!).  The first work was in the mid-80s in yeast, by
<br>
Nagley's group.  Therapeutic relevance was suggested by Lander and Lodish
<br>
in 1990.  Hoeben was the first to suggest it for aging (in 1993).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think he has some possible work-arounds -- do a PubMed search for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers over the last 3-4 years or send him an email.
</em><br>
<p>Trends Biotechnol 18:394 and Antiox Redox Sign 3:1153.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the nucleus being a safer place than the mitochondria may be why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans such a small mt Genome -- someone (perhaps *you*?) needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write a paper comparing the human, elephant and whale (bowhead or blue)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mtDNA to each other to see if they &quot;solved&quot; this problem the same way.
</em><br>
<p>No, no point -- elephants and whales have so vastly lower a specific
<br>
metabolic rate that they don't need better maintenance machinery than
<br>
us in order to live longer.  (This is not to say that oxidative damage
<br>
is the only thing that matters in aging, of course, only that it affects
<br>
everything.)  Give me the $50m, I could spend it much better than that...
<br>
<p>Also, a genetic code disparity (UGA encoding STOP in the nucleus but
<br>
tryptophan in the mitochondria) has been present since animals diverged
<br>
from fungi (~1 billion years) and has totally prevented any gene transfer
<br>
in that time -- all animals encode exactly the same 13 protein in their
<br>
mtDNA.  That's a trivial thing to solve by biotechnology but completely
<br>
impossible for evolution.  (There is no code disparity in plants, which
<br>
has allowed Chlamy to do more.  Hm, but it didn't do it in order to live
<br>
longer.... Evolution is smart, but it has very different goals than us!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alternate ideas I've thought of is intracellular bacteria engineered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce the modified mtProteins or even souped up to produce and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; export ATP in high volumes (essentially recreating the mitochondria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with lesser free radical generation properties).
</em><br>
<p>Rather harder than modifying 13 genes....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process might be more robust mtDNA repair -- right now its pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimal compared to the nucleus (something like 120+ nuclear DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repair proteins).
</em><br>
<p>No - reversal or obviation of damage is what we need, not retardation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The short summary is that there are a number of ways to tackle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this problem.  The pain in the rear end problem that we really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to solve is what the heck in the mitochondrial transport
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chain is generating the free radicals in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every time I hear a talk on this topic it gives me a headache
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to the complexity.
</em><br>
<p>Progress is being made here -- we now know roughly where in Complex
<br>
I and precisely where in Complex III the superoxide is made.  But
<br>
making a modified enzyme that makes less (a) is probably very hard
<br>
and (b) only retards aging, doesn't reverse it, so we might as well
<br>
focus on a proper solution (nuclearising the genes).

<p>It's not the maintenance and repair.  The idea is that mtDNA mutations
<br>
would carry on happening but they wouldn't matter, because the same
<br>
proteins would be coming in from the cytosol.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I find it hard to see how this

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; time at that locus, which can't be a good look for DNA.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't a problem.  Nearly all our mitochondrial proteins are encoded
<br>
in the nucleus already.  The cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery
<br>
just works really fast compared to the mitochondrial one, so the cell
<br>
has no trouble making enough of most of these proteins from just two
<br>
copies of the gene.  The mt-coded ones aren't present in any greater
<br>
abundance than the nuclear-coded ones.
