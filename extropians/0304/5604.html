</em><br>
<p>I have no such compunction: vdare.com is crap.
<br>
<p>As if links to Pat Buchanan, Phyllis Schlafly and Ann Coulter aren't enough,
<br>
how about this delectable morsel from the vdare.com site (regarding the
<br>
14-year-old boy in 1955 who was killed in the summer of 1955 for &quot;what would
<br>
now be called sexual harrassment of a white woman&quot;)?:
<br>
<p>VDARE.COM does not, as it happens, advocate lynching. But it cannot be
<br>
denied that Till was lynched for what would now be called the sexual
<br>
harassment of a white woman. And elementary math suggests that, in the
<br>
almost five decades since his death, up to 1.5 million white women may have
<br>
been raped by blacks.
<br>
<p>This is the story of the Emmett Till incident:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html">http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory/early-civilrights/emmett.html</a>
<br>
<p>It seems curious that in the example above from the vdare.com site a &quot;white
<br>
woman&quot; is emphasized.  Why didn't the writer simply say &quot;what would now be
<br>
called sexual harrassment of a woman?&quot;
<br>
<p>This is not just crap, but seriously sick crap.
