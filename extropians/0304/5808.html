burdened so, will attempt to reduce the payout, e.g. by substituting

mechanized labor, stopping to patronize businesses which have to increase

prices to comply with the transfer demands, and the total amount 
<br>
redistributed to the poor will be greatly reduced.
<br>
<p>Rafal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the 60s and 70s I went through a number of these campaigns 
<br>
either through raising the minimum wage or through raises given as a result 
<br>
of collective bargaining.  BTW, in my experience bargaining goes on 
<br>
informally even in the absence of a formal bargaining agent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, in my experience, the reality was slightly different than 
<br>
what you described.  Mechanization seems to go on constantly and does not 
<br>
have much or any relationship to minimum wage.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is always some slack in any system and, in my 
<br>
experience, there will be enough to cover any increase in the minimum wage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happens?  When the increase in the wages occurs management 
<br>
will calculate how much the increase is costing them.  Management then tells 
<br>
its industrial engineers and production supervisors to eliminate that much 
<br>
labor.  The designated individuals go into the production area and start 
<br>
investigating who they can cut out of the work force.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the productivity level in the factories I have seen, it was 
<br>
never very difficult to eliminate enough labor to keep the total payroll at 
<br>
the same level.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me give you what I consider a more intelligent viewpoint. 
<br>
&nbsp;Suppose a modern factory splits its manufactory costs this way.
<br>
Labor           20%
<br>
Material       40
<br>
O'head         40
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now different factories will vary somewhat but those numbers should do 
<br>
for ball park numbers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition let me tell you the most productive factory I was ever in 
<br>
was Ford Motor Company.  My boss and I estimated that Ford was operating at 
<br>
70 (my boss) to 80% productivity.  At the low end of the scale companies 
<br>
frequently operated at an estimated 40 to 50%.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose you decide you have to cut labor 10% to pay for a payraise?  
<br>
If you look at the numbers above you can see you will only cut 2% from the 
<br>
manufacturing dollar.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, pretend you cut labor 10% and then instead of firing your 
<br>
junior workers you find ways to produce &amp; sell 10% more.  In that case you 
<br>
will pickup a per unit saving of 20% in the overhead assigned per unit.  That 
<br>
is equal to 4% in the manufacturing dollar.  Of course we are assuming that 
<br>
overhead is fixed and is relatively independent of throughput volume.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figuring here on the back of my envelope I will lose the savings in 
<br>
labor as that is lost due to the payraise.
<br>
Ron h.
