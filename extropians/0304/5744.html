</em><br>
<p>Yes. I became a libertarian rather than strongly apolitical (which was
<br>
my teenage creed), and realized that ethics does indeed matter (rather
<br>
than being a game for philosophers). I can't point to any particular
<br>
post that caused that change since it was rather the effect of
<br>
participating in the discourse and having to defend my arguments with
<br>
good reasoning. So maybe I didn't change my mind, but I rather grew up.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Memes are selfish -- they presumably have self-preservation
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &quot;change&quot; someone elses mind?  Perhaps a way of looking
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is completely futile -- i.e. it is *never* going to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles from the get go -- in turn it violates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rational thinking&quot; and &quot;self-direction&quot; principles --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why engage in arguments (discussions) that you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope of winning?  [Key point being that winning requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people shifting meme-sets and they (the meme-sets) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going fight to the death to prevent that.]  Are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the list discussions taking place under principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fantasy (i.e. that one can ever change another persons'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mind&quot; -- e.g. in effect &quot;execute&quot; a meme-set they may have.)
</em><br>
<p>How fiercely will you defend your opinion about the melting point of 
<br>
lead or the number of genes involved in photosynthesis? Most likely you 
<br>
are not attached to those opinions at all, and would gladly change them 
<br>
if you got better information. Similarly for a lot of more contentious 
<br>
issues; it might take a lot of examples and evidence, but over time you 
<br>
would change your mind. There might be memes that are so fiercely 
<br>
embedded that we cannot change them at all (since we ignore all attempts 
<br>
to do so), but there is plenty of good things to discuss and learn 
<br>
anyway. 
<br>
<p>The point of a mailing list is not to create a memetic monoculture with 
<br>
the best memes, but to allow memes to spread, recombine, compete and 
<br>
evolve into new memes.
