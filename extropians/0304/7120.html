<p><em>&gt;   Validity of Cosmic Doomsday Argument (CDA) implies that

<em>&gt;   Frequency of Doomsday civs &gt;= N * Frequency of Diaspora civs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   where N = (Typical Diaspora pop/Typical Doomsday pop)
</em><br>
<p>That's an interesting point.  I think I may have seen it before although
<br>
perhaps not expressed in such clear mathematical terms.  We discussed a
<br>
paper a few months ago, <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/physics/0302071">http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/physics/0302071</a>, which
<br>
expressed a similar idea in a more qualitative way:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is clear that there is some nonzero probability for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;civilization to survive early threats to its existence (nuclear war,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asteroid impact, etc.). Such a civilization might go on to spread
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;across its galaxy. It could endure for millions of years and contain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a huge number of individuals. We will refer to such civilizations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as long-lived. On the other hand, some civilizations will succumb to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existential threats and so be short-lived. What will be the fraction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of each?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the fraction of long-lived civilizations is tiny, nearly all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individuals will belong to them, and furthermore will live late
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their civilizations when most of the individuals live. That,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;however, is not the circumstance in which we find ourselves. Instead,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we find that we live either in a short-lived civilization or very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;early in a long-lived one. While we do not have a clear idea of how
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long to expect civilizations to last, when we take into account our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumstances, we should clearly update our ideas in favor of a much
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;larger chance for civilizations to be short-lived (Carter unpublished;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leslie 1996 p. 231). Thus unless we previously thought that long-lived
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;civilizations were much more likely, we should now think that almost
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all civilizations will be short-lived - a sort of universal doomsday.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if it has been mentioned here, but fans of the Doomsday
<br>
Argument might want to know that Nick Bostrom has published a book on
<br>
that argument and the many related concepts, Anthropic Bias: Observation
<br>
Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy, available from
