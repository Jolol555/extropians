Lee said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moreover, a number of bad laws have worsened the prospects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the poor, and have increased inequality.  Zoning ordinances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now used to prevent growth and thus to cordon off &quot;good&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas so that poorer people cannot move there.  Thus over time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cities become less homogeneous compared to, say, 1900.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Quite right but don't you mean *more* homogeneous and less heterogeneous?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Britain got richer in the enclosure movement, with tenants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being kicked off the land for sheep farming; the tenants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would probably have words about it not getting internally worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The land was communally owned, not privately, and it was becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a worse disaster each year for the people living there (they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not tenants as such, yet).  This, of course, is what is referred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to as &quot;the tragedy of the commons&quot;.  When the land became privately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owned, it turned out not to be theirs.  (Surprise, surprise---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zoning in the 18th century---the rich get to exclude the poor.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In any case, the conditions in the cities to which they moved,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as atrocious as they are to us, were probably better than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrific conditions from which they came.
</em><br>
<p>I can't let that pass without correcting it. Firstly the chronology is up
<br>
the spout. Enclosure of arable land (and converting of much upland areas for
<br>
pasture in the process) took place mainly in the fifteenth and early
<br>
sixteenth centuries and didn't require Enclosure Acts. Secondly, the land
<br>
that was enclosed in the eighteenth century (almost entirely pasture) was
<br>
*not* owned in common. There is still several million acres of &quot;common land&quot;
<br>
in Britain and every square foot of it is privately owned. &quot;Common land&quot; in
<br>
English law is privately owned land where the owner does not have the right
<br>
to exclude others from access to the land i.e. there is a public right of
<br>
access (in the 18th century this included the right to graze livestock). The
<br>
Enclosure Acts were not put through by landlords against the wishes of their
<br>
tenants. On the contrary, the Acts resulted from petitions which were signed
<br>
and drawn up by all of the people with an interest, including the tenants.
<br>
The procedure used meant that you had to have the tenants' agreement because
<br>
if they objected the cost of the Act would become prohibitive. In the long
<br>
run the landlords, along with the larger tenants, got most of the gain in
<br>
the shape of increased land values but in the shorter term a large part of
<br>
it went to smaller tenants. The undoubted losers were landless labourers who
<br>
lost their access rights. Sorry to go on, but this is a classic case of how
<br>
arguments about the present are distorted by bad history. The narrative of
<br>
enclosure that you both use is the one put forward by the Hammonds in the
<br>
1900s, which no historian has taken seriously since the 1960s.
