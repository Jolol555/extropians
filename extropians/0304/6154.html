<p><em>&gt; OK.  Now that we've clarified details... Yes, for certain definitions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil, I believe that more than a minor part of the &quot;elite&quot; earned their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fortune through evil.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's true.  But what I am saying is that they don't
<br>
appear to be SFAIK more evil than the general run of the
<br>
population.  For every bit of corruption at high levels,
<br>
you also at the same historical time find IMO comparable
<br>
flaws at lower levels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here we are talking more about deceit than force 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or fraud, but those also played a part.  Consider,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pick a particularly well documented example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trans-continental railroads.  The particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing they were building was a very worthwhile 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction, but the financing of it involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable chicanery, political manipulation, etc.
</em><br>
<p>And this was *entirely* the fault of the government.
<br>
It was widely, and erroneously (and to this day)
<br>
believed that government subsidies were necessary
<br>
to get anything going.  Quite the reverse is true.
<br>
<p>Yes, Fulton did invent the steamboat, but then the
<br>
stupid governments gave him monopoly power on rivers
<br>
until a famous supreme court decision went against
<br>
him.  True wealth was created by Commodore Vanderbilt,
<br>
who defied the government monopoly, and succeeded 
<br>
finally in driving those companies that bribed the
<br>
politicians out of business.
<br>
<p>Same thing for the railroads.  While, yes, the Union
<br>
Pacific and Western Pacific made record time, they
<br>
made terrible railroads, because they never intended
<br>
to profit from the roads themselves.  They wanted the
<br>
government subsidies, which paid by the mile.  On the
<br>
other hand, James Hill built the Northern Pacific,
<br>
and, since he intended for it to be a profitable line,
<br>
it went slower and didn't use government money.  It
<br>
*didn't* eventually go bankrupt.
<br>
<p>So the problem, as is so OFTEN the case, was compulsion
<br>
(the use of force) either via taxation---a form of 
<br>
stealing---or by making laws restricting freedom (as
<br>
in the case of granting monopolies).
