<p>
While I believe intake of saturated fats and cholesterol should be kept to
<br>
very modest levels, by eliminating dairy and by eating only lean meats, I do
<br>
not believe either should be eliminated entirely from the diet. Both were
<br>
present in modest quantities in the diets upon which we evolved. 
<br>
<p>The article cited by Brian supports my case but Harvey points out correctly
<br>
that the same website hosts some rather strange pseudoscience. 
<br>
<p>Below is one reason that modest amounts of cholesterol are needed in the
<br>
diet. This is one of several studies that show people with low cholesterol
<br>
are more prone to depression and suicide.
<br>
<p>Cholesterol is the precursor to most hormones, a fact which might help
<br>
explain associating between low cholesterol and depression. Low testosterone
<br>
and low DHEA, for example, are both associated with depression (the former
<br>
in men, the latter in both men and women). Cholesterol is a metabolic
<br>
precursor to both of these hormones. 
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
<p>Further evidence for low serum cholesterol and suicidal behaviour.

<br>
OBJECTIVE: To examine for a relationship between serum cholesterol and
<br>
suicidal behavior. METHODS: Patients admitted after an overdose (N=120) were
<br>
compared with controls (N=120) for their serum cholesterol levels. RESULTS:
<br>
Patients who had overdosed had significantly lower serum cholesterol levels
<br>
than controls (mean+/-S.D. 171+/-31 vs. 196+/-30 mg/dl, P&lt;0.0001).
<br>
CONCLUSION: These results add to a grouping literature reporting that low
<br>
serum cholesterol is associated with suicidal behavior.
