<p>WHY have we seen no sign of extraterrestrial civilisations? If they have 
<br>
arisen elsewhere in the Milky Way, they are likely to be millions or even 
<br>
billions of years ahead of us, which should have given them plenty of time to 
<br>
spread to every corner of the Galaxy - including our corner. 
<br>
<p>In his highly entertaining and thought-provoking book, Where is Everybody, 
<br>
Stephen Webb sets out a host of possible solutions to the so-called Fermi 
<br>
paradox, famously posed by the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi. He could have 
<br>
given us 500 but he settled for just 50. 
<br>
<p>His answers? The ET signal has already arrived but is hopelessly lost in the 
<br>
data. ETs are here and they call themselves Hungarians (probably a long-shot, 
<br>
that one). We are in a virtual-reality &quot;planetarium&quot; engineered to present us 
<br>
with the illusion that the Universe is devoid of intelligent life. Or ETs are 
<br>
us, a logical consequence of the idea that our planet was &quot;seeded&quot; by 
<br>
primitive life from space. It's a game we can all play, which is half the 
<br>
fun.
<br>
<p>Webb sadly confesses that the only solution that makes sense to him is that 
<br>
we really are alone. Personally, I prefer Arthur C. Clarke's more upbeat 
<br>
explanation: &quot;I'm sure the Universe is full of intelligent life - it's just 
<br>
been too intelligent to come here
