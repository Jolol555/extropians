</em><br>
<p>There is certainly a selection effect, but it is likely more complex. 
<br>
The XNTX dominance on the list seems to be one of the few statistically 
<br>
significant examples of this. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would seem to relate closely to ExI principle 7:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Rational Thinking&quot; -- if one cannot think &quot;rationally&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then how can one choose to &quot;change&quot; ones mind?
</em><br>
<p>Bu on the other hand transhumanists in general and we on this list 
<br>
doesn't seem to be that more rational about our lives or ideas than any 
<br>
other group of well-educated intellectual people. We have shared ideas 
<br>
and views to a great extent which makes us overlook the stupidity and 
<br>
irrationality sometimes hidden in our midst (I admit it, it happens all 
<br>
the time that I find myself accepting an argument that actually isn't 
<br>
very strong because it agrees with everything else I think I know or 
<br>
value).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This then relates to the question of whether we are anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near having the computer/AI technology to determine whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are making rational arguments? (I'd like to browse the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Javien Forum with those as priority messages.)  If we aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close to having the computer understand such arguments can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we get away with Bayesian filtering methods to do at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some fraction of the job?
</em><br>
<p>Many arguments' validity hinge on so many other things that they
<br>
probably cannot be regarded as rational or not, even when supported by
<br>
evidence. As an example, take the recent metastudies showing that the
<br>
early middle ages was a warm period and the climate is shifting back
<br>
towards this state, possibly without link to greenhouse emissions. These
<br>
studies hinge on hundreds of other studies, which in turn are based on
<br>
research of shifting quality and methods of different applicability.
<br>
Some may complain about the uncertaintites of limnological data, others
<br>
might worry about how much we can trust the individual researchers in
<br>
the metastudies and the studies they build from. So using these
<br>
metastudies as an argument for something is equivalent to basing the
<br>
argument on a huge pile of assumptions or bayesian priors. Which we do
<br>
all the time of course, chunking all these priors into worldviews and
<br>
bad everyday reasoning (&quot;Greenpeace always inflates their numbers&quot;/&quot;That
<br>
study was founded by Evil Corporation&quot;/&quot;Professor Knödlerbach is usually
<br>
right about this kind of things&quot;).
<br>
<p><p>I would love to build a graphical computer-aided system for building
<br>
rational arguments, even if they were lacking in the depth or complexity
<br>
we see in ordinary discussions. It would be great to use as a skeleton
<br>
for building scientific theories or thinking about what to research
<br>
right now.
