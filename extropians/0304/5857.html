<p>Middle Ages were warmer than today, say scientists 
<br>
By Robert Matthews, Science Correspondent
<br>
(Filed: 06/04/2003) 
<br>
<p><p>Claims that man-made pollution is causing &quot;unprecedented&quot; global warming have 
<br>
been seriously undermined by new research which shows that the Earth was 
<br>
warmer during the Middle Ages.
<br>
<p>From the outset of the global warming debate in the late 1980s, 
<br>
environmentalists have said that temperatures are rising higher and faster 
<br>
than ever before, leading some scientists to conclude that greenhouse gases 
<br>
from cars and power stations are causing these &quot;record-breaking&quot; global 
<br>
temperatures.
<br>
<p>Last year, scientists working for the UK Climate Impacts Programme said that 
<br>
global temperatures were &quot;the hottest since records began&quot; and added: &quot;We are 
<br>
pretty sure that climate change due to human activity is here and it's 
<br>
accelerating.&quot;
<br>
<p>This announcement followed research published in 1998, when scientists at the 
<br>
Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia declared that the 
<br>
1990s had been hotter than any other period for 1,000 years.
<br>
<p>Such claims have now been sharply contradicted by the most comprehensive 
<br>
study yet of global temperature over the past 1,000 years. A review of more 
<br>
than 240 scientific studies has shown that today's temperatures are neither 
<br>
the warmest over the past millennium, nor are they producing the most extreme 
<br>
weather - in stark contrast to the claims of the environmentalists.
<br>
<p>The review, carried out by a team from Harvard University, examined the 
<br>
findings of studies of so-called &quot;temperature proxies&quot; such as tree rings, 
<br>
ice cores and historical accounts which allow scientists to estimate 
<br>
temperatures prevailing at sites around the world.
<br>
<p>The findings prove that the world experienced a Medieval Warm Period between 
<br>
the ninth and 14th centuries with global temperatures significantly higher 
<br>
even than today.
<br>
<p>They also confirm claims that a Little Ice Age set in around 1300, during 
<br>
which the world cooled dramatically. Since 1900, the world has begun to warm 
<br>
up again - but has still to reach the balmy temperatures of the Middle Ages.
<br>
<p>The timing of the end of the Little Ice Age is especially significant, as it 
<br>
implies that the records used by climate scientists date from a time when the 
<br>
Earth was relatively cold, thereby exaggerating the significance of today's 
<br>
temperature rise. 
<br>
<p>According to the researchers, the evidence confirms suspicions that today's 
<br>
&quot;unprecedented&quot; temperatures are simply the result of examining temperature 
<br>
change over too short a period of time.
<br>
<p>The study, about to be published in the journal Energy and Environment, has 
<br>
been welcomed by sceptics of global warming, who say it puts the claims of 
<br>
environmentalists in proper context. Until now, suggestions that the Middle 
<br>
Ages were as warm as the 21st century had been largely anecdotal and were 
<br>
often challenged by believers in man-made global warming.
<br>
<p>Dr Philip Stott, the professor emeritus of bio-geography at the University of 
<br>
London, told The Telegraph: &quot;What has been forgotten in all the discussion 
<br>
about global warming is a proper sense of history.&quot;
<br>
<p>According to Prof Stott, the evidence also undermines doom-laden predictions 
<br>
about the effect of higher global temperatures. &quot;During the Medieval Warm 
<br>
Period, the world was warmer even than today, and history shows that it was a 
<br>
wonderful period of plenty for everyone.&quot;
<br>
<p>In contrast, said Prof Stott, severe famines and economic collapse followed 
<br>
the onset of the Little Ice Age around 1300. He said: &quot;When the temperature 
<br>
started to drop, harvests failed and England's vine industry died. It makes 
<br>
one wonder why there is so much fear of warmth.&quot;
<br>
<p>The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the 
<br>
official voice of global warming research, has conceded the possibility that 
<br>
today's &quot;record-breaking&quot; temperatures may be at least partly caused by the 
<br>
Earth recovering from a relatively cold period in recent history. While the 
<br>
evidence for entirely natural changes in the Earth's temperature continues to 
<br>
grow, its causes still remain mysterious.
<br>
<p>Dr Simon Brown, the climate extremes research manager at the Meteorological 
<br>
Office at Bracknell, said that the present consensus among scientists on the 
<br>
IPCC was that the Medieval Warm Period could not be used to judge the 
<br>
significance of existing warming.
<br>
<p>Dr Brown said: &quot;The conclusion that 20th century warming is not unusual 
<br>
relies on the assertion that the Medieval Warm Period was a global 
<br>
phenomenon. This is not the conclusion of IPCC.&quot;
<br>
<p>He added that there were also doubts about the reliability of temperature 
<br>
proxies such as tree rings: &quot;They are not able to capture the recent warming 
<br>
of the last 50 years,&quot; he said.
