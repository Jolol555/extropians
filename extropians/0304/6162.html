<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Such as one where one person owns all the land?  Or would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;redistribution there still be a violation of the sacred
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;rights of property?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;That's exactly the right question, and it was the one asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;by a number of American administrations in the 1950s - 1980s,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;when they were doing whatever they could---hang preconceptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;and ideology---to keep nations in Latin America and Africa
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;from falling into the hands of the Russians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In some cases they were doing all they could to keep the nations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;out of the hands of the nations' own people and their duly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;elected representatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For what motive?  That is, in your model of reality, what would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the motive of the U.S. have been to avoid having the land fall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the hands of a nation's own people?
</em><br>
<p>Simple.  If it was not in our economic and geo-political 
<br>
interest to have them be independent and sometimes uncooperative 
<br>
with us we sometimes apparently decided to oust their duly 
<br>
elected government.  I am not making this up.  Do you want 
<br>
chapter and verse quoted?  It is not up to me to say why we did 
<br>
this.  Especially since I don't understand the &quot;why&quot;.  I simply 
<br>
point out that we did do this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;From earlier postings, I get the feeling that you just believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. foreign policy to be intrinsically wicked, so that it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course immediately follow that it would have as its first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priority the detriment of the people, which ignores incentives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is a dumb reading of history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is an exceedingly dumb reading of what I have said.  Like I 
<br>
say, I did not make this up.  I am going on vacation starting 
<br>
tomorrow but if you want a list of such events, just say the word.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I do not believe that all of this was only about keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the Russians from grabbing these countries. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, then, which country's land distribution would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to discuss first?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Land distribution?  Do you want to reduce our actions 
<br>
interfering with other countries to only that issue?  Why?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I especially do not believe when our policies did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;become more hands-off after the fall of the USSR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It may be a week before I get to go into detail on this and some 
<br>
other current issues as I hope to not be around computers much 
<br>
for about 7 days or so.
