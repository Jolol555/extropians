<p>Casteneda was, I think, an example of a &quot;novelist&quot; (or philosopher, or
<br>
whatever you wanna call him) whose ideas were a potpourri of emerging
<br>
memes, which he harvested, molded into just the right format,  and
<br>
served them up at just the right time to the general public.  And got
<br>
rich off of it.
<br>
<p>Another  writer who came along about 20 years or so later and did much
<br>
the same thing was Whiteley Streiber.  He harvested all those UFO
<br>
memes floating around ot there and molded them into just the right
<br>
framework of quasi-fictional, quasi-autobiographical pseudo-religion,
<br>
which he served up in the bookstores. And got rich, too.
<br>
<p>Of course, Streiber was the superior craftsman, by far. 
<br>
<p>I don't keep up with fiction anymore, but I imagine there are a few
<br>
writers out there right now trying to come up with the next
<br>
collective-pop-consciouness pseudo-religion.  Look for elements of
<br>
genetic engineering (of course, Strieber already tapped that vein a
<br>
bit, and was he ever prescient on that score).
