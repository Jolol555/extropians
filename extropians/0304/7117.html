</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and sheep that infest so many islands denuded of trees,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bushes, and much of everything else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is also a behaviorist view of animal psychology. &quot;It doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they might think,&quot; say the behaviorists, &quot;It only matters what they do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Animal nature is defined by what they do in and to their environments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of their conscious subjective intentions.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>I have no argument whether or not Jared Diamond ought to be viewed
<br>
as having behaviorist tendencies.  His tremendous book, &quot;Guns,
<br>
Germs, and Steel&quot; is, of course, the pre-eminent geographical
<br>
determinist treatise of our times.
<br>
<p>In a sense, that's obvious:  animals on different continents
<br>
evolve to different ends, and so did people.  In the shorter
<br>
term, culture behaves as *identity*:  even if the ultimate
<br>
causes of culture and genes are geographic, for the short
<br>
term, culture possesses a kind of inertia and provides identity.
<br>
<p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig3/long1.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig3/long1.html</a>
<br>
(which is mostly about Iceland).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diamond is best known for his 1997 book Guns, Germs, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steel: The Fates of Human Societies, which argues that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history is determined primarily by geographical rather
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than cultural factors; he applies a similar analysis here,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintaining that the Icelanders' radically decentralized
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political system was forced on them by Iceland's scanty
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supply of natural resources, leaving them &quot;too poor even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to afford a government.&quot; (Oh, for such poverty!) In short,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law of Iceland was not the product of its inhabitants'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own ideas and values, but was in effect selected for them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the nature of their physical environment. 
<br>
<p>See the identity tie-in?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But didn't the Icelanders choose that environment because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were hostile to centralized power back home?  And
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't the structure of their legal system reflect that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very hostility?  Diamond can hardly ignore these facts,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he minimizes their importance: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Having emigrated to Iceland in order to be independent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the growing power of the Norwegian king, Icelanders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wanted minimal government anyway, and that attitude let
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them make a virtue of the necessity imposed by their poverty.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Icelandic cultural attitudes were causally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant to the outcome; although the system the Icelanders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ended up with was to their liking, they would have ended up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with much the same system whether they liked it or not.
<br>
<p>Then he says a little later
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diamond's geography-is-destiny approach to history deserves
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our skepticism in any case.  The world is full of bleak,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhospitable, resource-poor regions whose inhabitants scratch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out a meager living; but how many such regions have left us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cultural legacy comparable to medieval Iceland's?  Diamond
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would do well to heed philosopher R. G. Collingwood's dictum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that history is ultimately determined not by nature, but by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what human beings make of nature. 
<br>
<p>And suddenly we're right back (IMO) to free will vs. determinism.
<br>
To those who are well informed, however, I would suggest that what
<br>
is at issue here is the length of the causal chain.
<br>
<p>(To illustrate, consider the following example:  the Israelis are
<br>
far less successful than the people around them in terms of birthrate
<br>
and piety, but more successful in economics, agriculture, and warfare.
<br>
How far back does the actual determinism reach?  One generation, if
<br>
you asked Skinner, perhaps ten if you asked me, and perhaps fifty
<br>
if you asked someone who believed that the genes determine *everything*.)
