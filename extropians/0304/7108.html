Eliezer S. Yudkowsky:
<br>
<p>You did not answer my question, Eliezer.
<br>
<p>Would Mr. Hugh M. Species in 12,000 BC have been acting unreasonably if he
<br>
asked the new dairy and grain farmers to prove their case that their
<br>
new-fangled foods were healthy additions to the diet? Please answer this
<br>
important question.
<br>
<p>You might agree with me that yes, this burden-of-proof demand was
<br>
reasonable, but then go on to claim that the demand is no longer valid given
<br>
that ~14,000 years have passed since the advent of dairy and agriculture.
<br>
However in that case the burden of proof then shifts logically to you to
<br>
show that we have evolved to such a degree that bread and milk add something
<br>
to human health vs other more nutrient-dense paleolithic sources of
<br>
calories. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For millions of years you've done fine on a diet of &quot;things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that taste good&quot;, following the decision rule of, if two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foods are available, preferring to eat the one that tastes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best.  Suddenly you awaken one morning to find paleodiet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorists claiming that this evolved instinctive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple rule no longer works 
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think sweet and fatty foods taste good? 
<br>
<p>Surely it is because paleo humans were always in a near desperate search for
<br>
much needed calories needed to survive. Paleo humans who liked the taste of
<br>
high-carb and high-fat foods tended to survive and multiply, and so we
<br>
moderns are left with their legacy: the reward circuitry in our brains is
<br>
activated by the taste of fat and sugar. Modern farmers have profited from
<br>
this at our expense by over-indulging us with the excessive quantities of
<br>
non-paleolithic sweet and fatty foods that activate our neural reward
<br>
circuitry.
