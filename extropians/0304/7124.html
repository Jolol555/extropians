<p><em>&gt; For example, I happen to be born as a white westerner in the 20th century,

</em><br>
<p>And yet, if everyone reasoned that way, most people would be right.
<br>
Most of them would say, I was born as a poor Chinese or Indian peasant.
<br>
And indeed, that is the most common circumstance for a human being today.
<br>
<p>Just because a statistical argument doesn't work in every case is no
<br>
reason to reject it.  If you flip 100 coins, you expect about 50 heads.
<br>
That is a valid argument even though some people will see many more
<br>
or fewer.
<br>
<p>In the same way, assuming that one is a relatively typical human being
<br>
will be correct for the majority of human beings, who are by definition
<br>
relatively typical.  You personally are an exception; you are like the
<br>
person who flips coins and gets 100 out of 100 heads.  I won't claim
<br>
that the exception proves the rule, but at least it fails to invalidate
<br>
it.
