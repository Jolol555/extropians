Quoth Michael Dickey:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; $1.3B is not a &quot;tie&quot; with $1.98B.  That's a 52.3% difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well Brendan, thanks for the Math lesson. I am fully aware that 1.9 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.3B are not a 'tie' however, my first suggestion of 12 billion was quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off, and the difference between 1.9 and 1.3 billion compared to 12 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a insignificant enough as to be considered a 'tie' for the context of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; discussion.  But we all welcome further information on this list, so
</em><br>
thanks
<br>
<em>&gt; for spending more googling time digging up more accurate figures than I
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; being kind enough to relay them to us.
</em><br>
<p>You're welcome.  :-)  I figured it was a good opportunity for my first
<br>
post, since I was interested in the figures, and people on the list
<br>
didn't seem to be aware of them.  The research was pretty enlightening.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I do not think your insult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disguised as a nitpick was neccessary.  But thats just my 2c.
</em><br>
<p>Please don't put words in my mouth, it wasn't an insult.  Do you seriously
<br>
think that numbers on the same order of magnitude should be considered
<br>
&quot;tied?&quot;  Would $1.3B and $8B be a &quot;tie&quot; as well?  The word &quot;tie&quot; was a
<br>
significant mischaracterization of the numbers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aid to Israel in 2003 will be $2.1B.  And $12B is over 3x the US'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; total foreign military aid allocation.  Damien is conflating total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foreign aid figures with foreign military aid figures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Originaly I was referring to Egypts non-military aide, but I did not relay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much as I did not, at the time, have the time to dig up the
</em><br>
information.
<br>
<em>&gt; So are you agreeing than the Egypt is the single biggest reciepient of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-military aide?
</em><br>
<p>Again, this mischaracterizes the numbers.  Egypt will be
<br>
the largest recipient of US economic aid for the FIRST
<br>
TIME in 2003.  Israel's economic aid has historically been
<br>
about 1.4x Egypt's.  According to the US state department,
<br>
(<a href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/9190.pdf">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/9190.pdf</a>), there has been
<br>
a 7/10 (Egypt/Israel) ratio between total aid to Israel and Egypt from
<br>
1979 through the present.  By a wide margin, Israel is the top recipient
<br>
both of military and combined military/economic aid.
<br>
<p>The reason Egypt's aid will be larger (by a narrow margin, $19M) this year
<br>
is as follows.  At Israel's request, we are decreasing their economic
<br>
aid by $120M/yr and increasing their military aid $60M/yr over the next
<br>
ten years.  Simultaneously, by our OWN volition, we are decreasing Egypt's
<br>
economic aid to match.  And we're not increasing Egypt's military subsidy.
<br>
So, starting in 2003 (and continuously until both their subsidies hit 0?),
<br>
Egypt's economic aid package is marginally larger than Israel's, yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's cute that people think this isn't about oil, economy and empire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its cute that people think this IS about oil, economy, and empire.
</em><br>
<p>What would your reading of these numbers be, in re: of our foreign policy
<br>
interests in the Middle East?  I'm interested in what you think about
<br>
that last paragraph above.
