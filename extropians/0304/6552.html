<p><em>&gt; So IMO the whole HCA thing is likely overblown

<p>Possibly, and possibly not. The jury is still out on HCA's. I'll agree
<br>
completely that the evidence from nutrition science is so far inconclusive.
<br>
<p>Again I want to emphasize that paleodiet theory rests on evolution science,
<br>
not nutrition science. We know with a high degree of confidence approaching
<br>
certainty that fire-cooking was not an important part of the diet of early
<br>
hominids. The only real question is whether it arose far enough in the past
<br>
that we can say safely that we are genetically adapted to HCA's.
<br>
Conservative paleodieters prefer not to take their chances, so they prepare
<br>
their meats in ways that minimize the risks.
<br>
<p>My own view is that HCA's are carcinogenic but that they might be rendered
<br>
safe or safer in diets rich in antioxidants. This would not mean however
<br>
that I think we are actually adapted to them. Like AGE's, they have no food
<br>
value and may present a risk to health. 
<br>
<p>It's a bit like my argument about tomatoes: non-paleolithic tomatoes are
<br>
very rich in glutamate, which in excess can cause nervous system damage. Is
<br>
it safe nevertheless to eat a lot of tomatoes? Do the known benefits of
<br>
tomatoes (e.g., lycopene) outweigh the risks of eating a non-paleolithic
<br>
food known to be rich in a known excitotoxin? I think the only honest answer
<br>
is &quot;Probably, but then perhaps not.&quot; No one really knows. We do however know
<br>
with complete certainty that our prehistoric ancestors did not eat tomatoes,
<br>
which places tomatoes in the &quot;dubious&quot; category alongside HCA's from
<br>
fire-cooking.
<br>
<p>Below is some evidence that suggests we are not adapted to HCA's. I offer it
<br>
not as conclusive proof, but rather to show that it should be a matter of
<br>
concern.

<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
Dietary intake of heterocyclic amines, meat-derived mutagenic activity, and
<br>
risk of colorectal adenomas.

<br>
Meats cooked well-done by high temperature techniques produce mutagenic
<br>
compounds such as heterocyclic amines (HCAs), but the amounts of these
<br>
compounds vary by cooking techniques, temperature, time, and type of meat.
<br>
We investigated the role of HCAs in the etiology of colorectal adenomas and
<br>
the extent to which they may explain the previously observed risk for red
<br>
meat and meat-cooking methods. In a case-control study of colorectal
<br>
adenomas, cases (n = 146) were diagnosed with colorectal adenomas at
<br>
sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and controls (n = 228) were found not to have
<br>
colorectal adenomas at sigmoidoscopy. Using a meat-derived HCA and mutagen
<br>
database and responses from a meat-cooking questionnaire module, we
<br>
estimated intake of 2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline
<br>
(DiMeIQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx),
<br>
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and mutagenic
<br>
activity. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using
<br>
logistic regression adjusting for several established risk factors for
<br>
colorectal adenomas or cancer. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval; P
<br>
for trend test) fifth versus first quintiles are: 2.2 (1.2-4.1; P = 0.02)
<br>
for DiMeIQx; 2.1 (1.0-4.3; P = 0.002) for MeIQx; 2.5(1.1-5.5; P = 0.02) for
<br>
PhIP; and 3.1 (1.4-6.8; P = 0.001) for mutagenic activity. When the three
<br>
HCAs were adjusted for the other two, only the trend for MeIQx (P = 0.04)
<br>
remained statistically significant. When we tried to disentangle the
<br>
relative contribution of the three HCAs from the meat variables, we found
<br>
that MeIQx remained significantly associated with risk even when adjusted
<br>
for red meat but not vice versa. When MeIQx and well-done meat were analyzed
<br>
in the same model, the risks were attenuated for both. Mutagenic activity
<br>
from meat remained significantly associated with increased risk even when
<br>
adjusted for intake of red meat or well-done red meat, whereas the red meat
<br>
and well-done red meat associations were no longer significant when adjusted
<br>
for total mutagenic activity. In conclusion, we found an elevated risk of
<br>
colorectal adenomas associated with high intake of certain HCAS: Further,
<br>
mutagenic activity from cooked meat consumption, a measure that integrates
<br>
all of the classes of mutagens, was strongly associated with risk and
<br>
explained the excess risk with intake of well-done red meat.
