Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<em>&gt;I am not familiar with the history of the use of MDMA in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychotherapy.  I know that MDA was originally quite successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the treatement of alcoholism, which is what it was designed for.
</em><br>
<p>I'd have to pull out my copy of PIHKAL and look, but some words on
<br>
its use in psychotherapy might be described in that book.
<br>
<p>Following a paper trail with Dr. Lester Grinspoon might shed some light,
<br>
as well:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.maps.org/dea-mdma/pdf/0006.PDF">http://www.maps.org/dea-mdma/pdf/0006.PDF</a>
<br>
Testimony of Dr. Lester Grinspoon, comparing the decision to schedule
<br>
MDMA to the scheduling of LSD, halting potentially beneficial research,
<br>
and discussing MDMA's promise in therapy, April 18, 1985
<br>
<p>Grinspoon: &quot;MDMA appears to have some of the advantages of LSD-type
<br>
drugs without most of the corresponding disadvantages&quot;
<br>
<p>This web page shows an interesting chronology, by the way:
<br>
<p>Documents from the DEA Scheduling Hearing of MDMA, 1984-1988
<br>
<a href="http://www.maps.org/dea-mdma/">http://www.maps.org/dea-mdma/</a>
<br>
(I was especially surprised to see Nathaniel Branden on that list,
<br>
against MDMA)
<br>
<p>and a summary of the results:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/dll/mdma_scheduling_history.htm">http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/dll/mdma_scheduling_history.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Note this part:
<br>
&quot;The medical community fired back. Lester Grinspoon, an associate
<br>
professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School sued the DEA,
<br>
seeking to invalidate MDMA's Schedule I status.[6] The federal
<br>
circuit court that heard the case succinctly summarized the
<br>
competing arguments: &quot;The [DEA] Administrator reads &quot;accepted
<br>
[medical use]&quot; to mean that the FDA must have approved the drug for
<br>
interstate marketing. Dr. Grinspoon, on the other hand, prefers to
<br>
interpret &quot;accepted&quot; as meaning that the medical community generally
<br>
agrees that the drug has a medical use and can be used safely under
<br>
medical supervision.&quot;[7]

<br>
<em>&gt;Sorry, but I knew the original researcher.  It was first created

</em><br>
<p>Cool. We knew some of the same people.
