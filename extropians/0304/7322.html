<br>
<p>It's one of those strange coincidences... I just started Atkins on the 25th,
<br>
and only just saw these messages today. I'll describe my experience so far,
<br>
including a wrinkle which I didn't expect...
<br>
<p>I'll begin by saying that I've never been on a diet in my life, and haven't
<br>
needed to. Arguably I probably still don't need to, but I am starting to
<br>
noticably gain a little weight, so I've been wondering about it for a while.
<br>
Then my wife started this diet last week, and wanted some support, so I
<br>
thought &quot;hey, how bad can it be&quot;?
<br>
<p>Good and bad, actually. I'm firmly in the induction period (2 weeks
<br>
basically of meat, eggs, and some salad and vegies, and pretty much nothing
<br>
else). I've been on an almost vegetarian diet, mostly because my
<br>
mother-in-law, who lives with us, is vegetarian, so it's easier. I've never
<br>
really eaten a lot of meat anyway, even as a kid.
<br>
<p>Suddenly, I'm the monster of meat. This is a really counterintuitive diet,
<br>
all about fat. btw, someone recently said that it isn't necessary to eat
<br>
lots of fat on the Atkins diet; actually, it is. In his book, he
<br>
specifically recommends against diet products, not only because they often
<br>
contain sugar (which is outlawed), but because not consuming enough fat will
<br>
cause this diet to not work.
<br>
<p>I have had really bad sugar cravings. My house is full of fresh fruit and
<br>
chocolate and lollies (kids &amp; easter will do that). It's pretty hard. But
<br>
I've coped with that by consuming a fair amount of saccarin sweetened stuff,
<br>
and pretending it's sugar (grimace).
<br>
<p>The real kicker though, has been a totally unexpected one.
<br>
<p>A constant in my life since I had my first child (7 years ago) has been
<br>
coffee... well, caffeine addiction, actually. I drink vast amounts of strong
<br>
brewed coffee, go through patches of regular headaches, long term increased
<br>
anxiety, tension. Nasty stuff. But it is really hard to break the habit;
<br>
just to cut down I usually reduce my intake by 1 cup per week, which is slow
<br>
enough to not bring on caffeine withdrawal headaches.
<br>
<p>Now this is a problem with Atkins, because apparently caffeine messes with
<br>
blood sugar levels; you aren't supposed to drink any coffee. I though I'd
<br>
pretty much have to ignore this; cut it down a little, but really there's no
<br>
way I could cut it out just like that, is there?
<br>
<p>On the *second* day, I drank 1 cup of coffee all day, and felt fine. I
<br>
didn't want any more. I was really worried that this was a time bomb waiting
<br>
to go off, but the idea of coffee grossed me out.
<br>
<p>Yesterday, I drank 2 cups, the second one only because I went to a party
<br>
where I couldn't drink the champagne :-( sugar.
<br>
<p>Today, I'm writing this in the morning, I've had no coffee. None! I might go
<br>
make a decaf now, basically my morning coffee is a ritual that I've missed
<br>
this morning and feel like catching up on. But caffeine dependency... where
<br>
the hell did it go???
<br>
<p>I've always had sugar in my coffee, and I'm wondering whether this could all
<br>
be about blood sugar/insulin? Coffee with two sugars is probably a nightmare
<br>
for that; now that things are supposedly stabilised (though I feel weird as
<br>
all crap), I just don't want it.
<br>
<p>Certainly I noticed some time ago that my impending headaches could
<br>
sometimes be stopped via massive consumption of fatty foods (KFC, better
<br>
than ibuprofen!).
<br>
<p>One other thing; my wife has been having a really hard time on this diet;
<br>
she says she feels like she did when she was morning sick, which can't be
<br>
good. Apparently some people do have a bad reaction to it. As for me, well I
<br>
feel weird, not bad not good but strange. Losing coffee is a giant plus,
<br>
though, so I'll stick induction out if only for that. The real test will be
<br>
to see if I can stay off coffee; as a programmer, who needs to be able to
<br>
concentrate in that particularly singular way demanded by long coding
<br>
stretches, I have depended on coffee as a stimulant. So I've quit it before,
<br>
but ended up going back to it. But we'll see...

transhuman vision seems truly difficult to realise).
