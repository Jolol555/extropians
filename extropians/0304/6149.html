<p>Given your other views, I'm not suprised. Your problem is that you are
<br>
viewing the rest of the world as if they all view the world the same
<br>
way as you. They don't. Especially the muslim world does not.
<br>
Particularly the Arab world does not. In the arab world, force is
<br>
respected, compassion is spit upon.
<br>
<p>The current events bear this out. The outrage current in the muslim
<br>
world today about our victory over Hussein is not so much that we won,
<br>
though there is shock at that, it is disgust at Saddam for putting up
<br>
such a pathetically weak resistance to the infidels. For that, people
<br>
slap his face with the soles of their shoes. They feel humiliated.
<br>
<p>It is really wrong to keep claiming that our policy in Iraq is a policy
<br>
of pre-emption. It makes you look foolish. Any thinking person
<br>
understands that Iraq violated, repeatedly, the cease fire agreement
<br>
that stopped the first Gulf War (but did not end it, contrary to
<br>
popular belief). Thus, our actions are simply a reinstatement of
<br>
hostilities at a higher level (since we have been regularly attacking
<br>
SAM and other sites on a regular basis for the last 12 years).
<br>
<p>As for pre-emption itself, it is exceedingly foolish to think that any
<br>
thinking person would have any other policy in a world where WMD are
<br>
becoming easier and more affordable for any tin pot thug to get ahold
<br>
of. One just does not let such threats exist if one expects to keep
<br>
one's job (or get reelected), especially in the post 9/11 world.
<br>
<p>Like the Roman wars against Carthage, Americans simply do not tolerate
<br>
attacks on the homeland, especially with sneak attacks of elephants
<br>
(airliners into skyscrapers) through the back door. The muslim world
<br>
will have its technological soil sown with salt if need be to prevent
<br>
another 9/11. America will do what it takes to prevent this from
<br>
reoccuring. It seems our solution is to sow muslim soil with democracy,
<br>
the very freedom that muslim dissidents have been clamoring for.
<br>
They'll get their freedom, and if they use it, like Iran, to sponsor
<br>
more anti-western terror, they'll get spanked down again.
