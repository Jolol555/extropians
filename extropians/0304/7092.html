On Tue, 22 Apr 2003, Adrian Tymes, responding to my comments
<br>
on the costs of genetic engineering wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hmm.  Correct me if I'm wrong, please, but none of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above sounds fundamentally difficult to manufacture.
</em><br>
<p>Some is and some isn't.  The plastic consumables are't
<br>
difficult to manufacture one just tends to need lots of
<br>
them.  The enzymes needed to manipulate DNA need to be
<br>
of very high quality so those are more expensive.  One
<br>
may pay several hundred dollars for a very small tube
<br>
of enzymes (a few ml).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which means, in theory, if one had a large marget of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would-be genetic engineers, one could set up efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass production of all of these components, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the consumables and enzymes.  The main reason they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost so much now is that the effort to set up initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing has to be amortized among a limited set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of customers.
</em><br>
<p>In part I'd agree.  There are probably only of the order
<br>
10's of thousands of molecular biologists in the world.
<br>
We might be up into the 100's but certainly not millions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is that it isn't cheap *right now*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this correct?
</em><br>
<p>In large part -- if you had many more working in the field
<br>
you would get more manufacturers and innovations, patent
<br>
expiration &amp; competition would tend to bring the costs
<br>
down.
<br>
<p>You have to keep in mind how many &quot;specialty&quot; items various
<br>
types of research requires.  The various reagent manufacturers
<br>
all (perhaps 3-5 significant ones) all have catalogs that
<br>
are an 1-2 inches thick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, then it would seem one of the more efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways to solve the problem would be to document some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple examples of the type of engineering you'd like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make cheap - basically, recipes that others could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow - and give them away.
</em><br>
<p>There are several major books one can by on &quot;protocols&quot;
<br>
of various types of molecular biolgy, recombinant DNA
<br>
manipulation, cell biology, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Good point.  One could, say, engineer or find a host
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimized for replication of virii; this would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant cost, but one-time.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that people are working with perhaps
<br>
half-a-dozen viruses for gene therapies for various
<br>
reasons -- each needs a &quot;specialized&quot; cell for
<br>
production.  So its hard to get the demand to develop
<br>
such cells until we start having situations where
<br>
we are doing 10's of thousands of gene therapies.
<br>
That will be hard because of the problems we've
<br>
had getting gene therapies to work and the regulatory
<br>
overhead of setting up such trials.  I think we've
<br>
only had in the clinics or under development a
<br>
thousand or so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Typical virii are much smaller than typical cells, no?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, would it be possible to pass the solution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; containing both virus and cells, through a filter with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small enough pores that only the virus could fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through?
</em><br>
<p>Actually much of the time the viruses are &quot;absorbed&quot; by
<br>
cellular processes normally involved in the transport of
<br>
various molecules/proteins.  That is why viruses tend to
<br>
be tissue specific -- they have adapted to make use of
<br>
naturally occuring receptors.
<br>
<p>You are correct in that the viruses must be filtered out
<br>
for any therapeutic applications.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If limiting copies/overwrites would be difficult, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps it might be easier to ensure that overwrites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be harmless?  Say, design the virii such that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if one infects an already infected cell, it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely knock out the previous copy and replace it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Which is why I use the term &quot;overwrite&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this would require &quot;site-specific integration&quot;.
<br>
We know of only 1 virus currently that manages this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; True, but then you face the problem of integrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these secondary nuclei into existing cells, putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one secondary nuclei into each cell instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple in one cell and none in its neighbors, making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure they divide when they rest of the cell divides,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; et cetera.  It seems, on first glance, that by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time you solve those problems you'd wind up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something very much like a non-self-reproducing virus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway.
</em><br>
<p>The *difference* is that with secondary nuclei (SN) you can
<br>
carry at least 600 genes, perhaps as many as 4000.
<br>
With viruses you are limited to probably 200 or even
<br>
6-50 probably in most viruses currently (all gene
<br>
theapies I've seen I believe are only attempting
<br>
a single gene).
<br>
<p>You can also make the secondary nuclei (SN) programs
<br>
complex enough that they could detect the other SN
<br>
and regulate their own copy number.  Making them
<br>
divide based on the normal division signals would
<br>
not be difficult.  Getting them to separate properly
<br>
is what is difficult -- even normal eukaryotic cells
<br>
don't manage to separate the replicated chromosomes
<br>
properly each time.
<br>
<p>But most cells in the body do not replicate -- at least
<br>
not frequently.  Really only the stem cells and the
<br>
entire Red blood cell/White blood cell systems do so.
<br>
So one could receive substantial benefits from such
<br>
architectures before one solved the replication
<br>
problem.
