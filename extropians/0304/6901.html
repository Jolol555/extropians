Mike Lorrey summed it up:
<br>
&lt;&lt;As we saw in last year's PBS series &quot;Frontier House&quot;, living the
<br>
luddite life has it's drawbacks and limitations. It also has a tendency
<br>
to be 'nasty, brutish, and short', in ways that are quite often glossed
<br>
over and overlooked by those who hate technology so...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The con artists you mentioned in the Nearing article (The Nearings) no doubt 
<br>
saw the failure of the economy, and it was a failure (circa 1932) as a good 
<br>
idea to have everyone become self-sufficient. My late father, always a New 
<br>
York city lad, saw farmers as wise, because they could grow their own food 
<br>
during the great depression, they never went hungry. He never saw how many 
<br>
hungry farmers there were because they couldn't keep their land, because of 
<br>
debt, or couldn't affording to fertilize their crops, or couldn't feed their 
<br>
livestock, etc.
<br>
<p>Greater self sufficency is not a bad goal, if one goes into it with their 
<br>
eyes open and not as a luddite (19th century romantic?) 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Joly and his wife live in Jamaica, Vermont, in an off-grid homestead of
<br>
20 acres. They heat their home with wood and grow much of their food.
<br>
They still find that his wife must work a full time job as a teacher in
<br>
order to make ends meet. &quot;It just isn't possible to homestead with the
<br>
template the Nearings presented, because they never addressed the issue
<br>
of income,&quot; Joly explains.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, the Ludds need to realize &quot;its the economy, stupid&quot; and their back to 
<br>
the land mentality, is best exemplified by Kampouchea's Pol Pot and Khmer 
<br>
Rogue mass murders. Are the Nearings the same as Pol Pot? No, the Nearings, 
<br>
far as we know, were not totalitarians, and were not statists. Good article 
<br>
though.
