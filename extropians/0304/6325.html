<em>&gt; &gt; For instance: mammal females love and nurture

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; males which maintain some juvenile characteristics
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have the term &quot;boyish good looks.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>From what I've observed, gay males generally relish &quot;boyish good looks&quot; more
<br>
than females.  In spite of all the progress that has been made since the
<br>
&quot;sexual revolution&quot; - it seems to me that far too many heterosexual females
<br>
are still primarily attracted to prestige, money, fame, power.  Why else
<br>
would young females hang out with the likes of The Donald, Hugh Hefner and
<br>
Woody Allen? (to cite just a few examples).  For females it seems that looks
<br>
count somewhat, but not as much as status; for males, it may be just the
<br>
opposite.  Many exceptions abound, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, and it might also explain the ongoing sexual revolution started in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; 70's.
</em><br>
<p>You're right - and the sexual revolution (a revolution in every sense,
<br>
mainly due to the advent of The Pill and IUD) will be &quot;ongoing&quot; ... that's a
<br>
good word for it.  Procreation and sex - although still riding a tandem
<br>
bicycle on many outings - have been liberated from having to travel on the
<br>
same path or even going in the same direction.
<br>
<p>Nurturing females would better appreciate males who share their
<br>
<em>&gt; nurturing values, leading to the &quot;sensitive guy&quot; attraction. Sensitive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nurturing male character traits might then might be passed on to future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generations.
</em><br>
<p>Bill Nye likes to say &quot;Science rules,&quot;  and I think science will eventually
<br>
have better (i.e., more predictable) results with &quot;passing&quot; character traits
<br>
to future generations ... whether they be humans, transhumans, or what have
<br>
you.
