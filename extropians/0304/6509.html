In a message dated 4/15/2003 12:20:58 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:Artillo5@cs.com?Subject=Re:%20GOV:%20US%20Reputation%20(RE:%20Arab%20World%20Stunned%20by%20Baghdad's%20Fall)">Artillo5@cs.com</a> writes: 2. &quot;Clear and present danger&quot; or &quot;actual threat&quot; is 
<br>
when that guy shows you that he's armed (means) AND reaches for his gun 
<br>
(intent). Both of these criteria must be met in order for a defense to this 
<br>
&quot;actual threat&quot; to be justified. So if you see a police officer with his 
<br>
sidearm in plain view, he obviously has the means to impose an &quot;actual 
<br>
threat&quot;, but not the intent.
<br>
<p>Artie,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that is all true.  But street logic sees it a little different.  
<br>
This guy is a known thug that is a sadist (see CNN's confession) and he has 
<br>
been making threats of massive violence.  We called a police officer to throw 
<br>
him out of a 3rd parties home, got his agreement to allow himself to be 
<br>
searched in exchange for not destroying his army, and after 12 years we have 
<br>
seen nothing but evasion, threats, and more sadism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime by lurking on a middle eastern site, reading Al 
<br>
Jazeera and the Jordan Times we know that the middle east strongly opposes 
<br>
disposing Sadaam and returning Iraq to the world oil market because they 
<br>
think it will cost them a trillion dollars over the next few years.  We also 
<br>
know the people of Iraq didn't want Sadaam because from those sources report 
<br>
volunteers from other middle eastern countries complaining about the Iraqi 
<br>
shooting them in the back while they were trying to fight the Americans.  We 
<br>
also know the European countries that were complaining were making a fat 
<br>
profit selling Sadaam the tools of war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a person with any street smarts would conclude that you really 
<br>
are as clean as the new fallen snow and don't know diddly about the ulterior 
<br>
motives of those around you -- but that instead you are parroting the 
<br>
opinions passed on to you by those that do have both inside knowledge as well 
<br>
as a very vested interest.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to sound so harsh but if you use the sources I have listed, to 
<br>
hear the other side, I think you will also come to the reallization that your 
<br>
good intentions have been used to take advantage of you.
<br>
