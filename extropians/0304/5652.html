<em>&gt; The point needs to be made over and over that the pre-1989
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world was a LOT DIFFERENT than now.  The West was fighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for its life against the Soviet play for world domination.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there is some argument that the situation was never 
<br>
quite so much like that as US intelligence and defense 
<br>
communities claimed.  But it sure was great for justifying a lot 
<br>
of nasty things.  Of course, post 1989 we didn't exactly change 
<br>
our spots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They devoted 14% of their GNP to military uses, but would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have devoted much more than that if they'd been capable of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The choice, as Max Plumm has eloquently explained, was never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;tyranny&quot; in a developing country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but between &quot;pro-U.S. authoritarianism&quot; and &quot;pro-Soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarianism&quot; in those places.  It's still an open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question even today whether democracy is at all possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a gross simplification that I doubt very much was the 
<br>
case in most of the things we were involved in.  It is hard to 
<br>
see how it had anything to do with most our actions outside of 
<br>
Cuba in Central America or with any of our actions in Latin 
<br>
American countries or with most of our actions in the MidEast 
<br>
except for Afghanistan.  The fight against communisum moved out 
<br>
of the McCarthy era into our foreign policy as justification for 
<br>
all things.  Communist were doubtless considered to be behind 
<br>
anyting anywhere that wasn't going quite as we wished it to go. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really shouldn't believe such rhetoric as &quot;we were 
<br>
fighting communism and that is why we did all these things&quot; 
<br>
without a lot of careful examination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;power corrupts&quot; in the usual formulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's suppose that the neo-cons get their way in the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few U.S. elections, and that after Iraq, other anti-Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyrannical regimes are also subjugated.  Moreover, along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the worst fears of many, let's suppose that American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hegemony in the world continues to grow.  What is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability in this case that the corruption of which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak will develop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Corruption isn't already pretty obviously present in US 
<br>
political and financial elites?  Really?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will it be different from 1945?  It is not thought that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S., in most areas of the world the single superpower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really got out of control then.  Frankly, unless there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big change in the nature of the American people, I can't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the United States will become aggressive or imperial any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So Bush's speech about us maintaining our dominance over all the 
<br>
rest of the world in perpetuity and considering it our right and 
<br>
duty to strike and even strike preemptively anywhere we believe 
<br>
our safety and interests to be threatened is not aggressive or 
<br>
imperial in any way?  What exactly would agressive and imperial 
<br>
look like then?  I wouldn't want to overlook it in my confusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;You know, if we were sufficiently bigger than anyone else, we could have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;more to spread extropian ideals and more to inhibit them than anyone else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with a net effect of spreading but a real inhibitory effect as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, then it remains to be spelled out by anyone up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge:  in what ways has U.S. economic and military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hegemony during the last *fifteen* years resulted in anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian tendencies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  Attempting to outlaw stem cell research could become 
<br>
universal, the religious right forcing various positions such as 
<br>
anti-abortion universally today, the US patent craziness killing 
<br>
many lines of research and development worldwide, the US backed 
<br>
IMF scheme leeching the developing world of wealth and 
<br>
possibilities to add to or participate in creating an extropic 
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>My greatest worry is that our pattern of aggression and tanking 
<br>
economy fuels ever more reaction and terrorism which fuels ever 
<br>
more agression and shredding of rights at home and increasing 
<br>
downward economic spiral as well.  At some point I would not at 
<br>
all be surprised by many nations valuing some other currency 
<br>
much more centrally than the dollar.  Which would make our 
<br>
economic woes much worse as we owe some of those nations 
<br>
trillions in debt. Quite honestly there is a real possibility 
<br>
that what this country is doing today could lead directly to 
<br>
this species not making it past its post-industrial stage.  Or 
<br>
do y'all think you will have the personal freedom and financial 
<br>
health necessary to create say an FAI or continue to optimize 
<br>
your life expectancy, personal computational environment and 
<br>
capabilities if the economy continues to tank, security comes 
<br>
before freedom and innovation, and one-sided total government 
<br>
surveillance becomes the norm?  Frankly I do not see how.
