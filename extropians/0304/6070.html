</em><br>
<p>So what if that is the case?  Do we need these people having 
<br>
some kind of forced (if they want to eat) make work in order to 
<br>
have all that we need in a truly abundant high tech economy? 
<br>
No, by definition.  People eventually get bored.

<p><em>&gt;&gt;From a strictly utilitarian point of view, humanity is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Society has been aware that this choice could be made

</em><br>
<em>&gt; every time; clearly, strict utilitarianism for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater good is not the guiding mindset.  (Whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is rightly so is another debate, but I'd say it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is their choice to make.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Society&quot; is not something alive than can choose.  It is a 
<br>
collection of individuals.  Individuals can certainly choose 
<br>
inefficient and outdated ways of doing things in very different 
<br>
and new circumstances.  That is fine as long as they cannot 
<br>
significantly impose their choice on others.  Often the new is 
<br>
not chosen simply because most people do not understand that our 
<br>
new circumstances bring new possibilities to choose among.  Most 
<br>
of us get caught flat-footed using unexamined assumptions that 
<br>
are no longer [fully] valid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not a danger of active mischief, but merely of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neglect of that which needs to be done, that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felled capitalism's alternatives.
</em><br>
<p>What needs to be done in a society of abundance?  Isn't it 
<br>
whatever some of the people find interesting and 
<br>
fruitful/entertaining/etc to do? Do you believe that no one 
<br>
would find any such things important and interesting enough to 
<br>
do them?  Do you believe that would be true of you or most of 
<br>
the people on this list?
<br>
<p>Capitalism as we know it rests on a series of assumptions about 
<br>
the relationship between human wants and resources.  In areas 
<br>
where that relationship becomes seriously modified capitalism as 
<br>
we know it may not be a reasonable choice.  Perhaps more 
<br>
clearly, why charge a price for that which is nearly infinitely 
<br>
abundant without serious depletion or even net increases with 
<br>
use?  Particulary if doing so actually decreases the value of 
<br>
that which is in question?  Why impose this model where there is 
<br>
no gain and actually loss in doing so?
