<em>&gt; I think you covered the problem with your other

</em><br>
<p>Good! 
<br>
<p>Of course you're right about the difficulties of 
<br>
communicating online, especially when those 
<br>
communications start to get a little technical. I hope
<br>
<p>you find a way to fix the problem. We'll see now if 
<br>
Eliezer also understands me. Strange thing about my 
<br>
dialogue in this thread with Eliezer is that I have 
<br>
agreed with virtually every word he's written in every
<br>
<p>post about paleodiet theory, and yet from his last 
<br>
post to me he apparently does not believe I agree with
<br>
<p>him. I hope that problem is also corrected from my 
<br>
reply to him.
<br>
<p>By the way I aced Quantitative Methods and Research
<br>
Design during my graduate work primarily because of my
<br>
term project. My project was a sophisticated software
<br>
program for handicapping pro football. Though the
<br>
professor couldn't have known it at the time, except
<br>
perhaps intuitively, my statistical algorithm was so 
<br>
good that it went on to pick the two Superbowl teams, 
<br>
and the winner of the Superbowl, in the sixth week of 
<br>
the season. It did so by collectively analyzing almost
<br>
<p>every football statistic imaginable for every game and
<br>
<p>for every team over a five year history, and in some 
<br>
very unique ways. The program was so complex that it 
<br>
took almost half an hour to compute the answer to any 
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>The funniest thing is that I was working intensely on 
<br>
my football handicapping project well before I ever 
<br>
enrolled to take the course. I was working on the 
<br>
project for simple pleasure, because I'm one of those 
<br>
rare birds who actually likes statistics (heck I 
<br>
don't even like football). I would have completed my 
<br>
personal project in exactly the same way regardless of
<br>
<p>whether I was enrolled in the course or not. In effect
<br>
<p>I aced the course simply because quantitive methods 
<br>
and research design happened to be my current hobby at
<br>
<p>the time.
<br>
<p>Another similar personal project of mine was beating 
<br>
the Nevado casinos at blackjack. Back in the early 
<br>
80's I was barred from playing cards at six Nevada 
<br>
casinos. But that's another long story and I won't 
<br>
bore you with it. Enough about me.
<br>
<p>If you aren't already doing so, I suggest you drop 
<br>
your vegetarian-like diet and start eating other 
<br>
healthy paleolithic foods! &lt;trying to the keep the 
<br>
discussion on-topic&gt;
