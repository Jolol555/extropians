a cheap fast diagnostic would be very beneficial. Just like when yer
<br>
antivirus program tells you a file is infected, that really helps. Chyina
<br>
though is not known for Quality Control and Transparency. I think if there
<br>
is a weak spot in the World right now, it might be China. They pack em in
<br>
their cities and they spit alot. Seriously, I live in San Francisco, chinese
<br>
culturally spit, never understood why they hock up big loogies and launch
<br>
them on the street, never thought it was hygenic, maybe the bubonic plague
<br>
our ancient ancestors had stopped them. But I digress.  On the other hand
<br>
they wear masks alot which we have never done, but not sure if masks really
<br>
help much.
<br>
<p>A rapid diagnostic would be great. Any delay to help scientists to
<br>
understand more about it would be good. It may take Martial law to do that
<br>
in some cases. If scientists can find a drug to make even a small difference
<br>
that may really help. Nobody knows yet what the denominator is in
<br>
virulaence. Thinking of how to telecommute for 3 -6 months would help. I
<br>
think alot more will be known in 3-6 months. Chinese cities are very crowded
<br>
and I think that really does not help.
<br>
<p>Good luck to us all,
<br>

Subject: SARS: Strategies
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As some here know, I have in the last few years made a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reorientation of a significant part of my business to East Asia in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general and China in particular.  The outbreak of SARS has begun to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an impact on my personal business plans and promises to have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing effect into the foreseeable future.  As a result, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally keenly interested in the prospects for successfully addressing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  I confess that I haven't been able to read the list very closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while discussion of SARS has begun here, so I'm hoping to elicit a new,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focused discussion that I can follow in detail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My question is this: What are the best strategies for addressing SARS in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the short, intermediate and long terms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Getting input from knowledgeable people here on the List can be a real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value to me, and I really appreciate it.
