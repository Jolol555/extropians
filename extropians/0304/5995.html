<p>
There's an annoying review in this month's Wired magazine by David
<br>
Gelernter of a book called Enough by Bill McKibben, opposing the ideas
<br>
of genetic engineering, designer babies, and posthumans.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/play.html?pg=3">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/play.html?pg=3</a>
<br>
<p>Gelernter is probably best known for being a victim of the Unabomber.
<br>
In what is perhaps a strange, virtual version of Stockholm Syndrome,
<br>
here he is advocating views which are very much in keeping with Ted
<br>
Kaczynski's view of the world.  In this glowing review (he even refers
<br>
to the book's writing as &quot;luminous&quot;), Gelernter can't say enough about
<br>
the horrors of genetic technology used to improve health and intellectual
<br>
and physical vigor, nor call supporters of the technology too many names.
<br>
<p>&quot;Arrogance&quot;, &quot;crime against humanity&quot;, &quot;control lust&quot;, &quot;naked nihilism&quot;.
<br>
Even James Watson, mockingly called &quot;His Eminence&quot;, is given disparaging
<br>
treatment, his quote taken out of context.  Gelernter concludes by
<br>
giving a vote of confidence to the Bible as a guide to the difficult
<br>
technological choices ahead.
<br>
<p>It's sad to see the continued reliance on name calling and emotional
<br>
pandering among opponents to radical change.  These kind of arguments give
<br>
us nothing to engage or address in terms of adding to the understanding of
<br>
these complex and difficult issues.  They close down discussion instead
<br>
of opening possibilities for dialog.  I hope that we can do better as
<br>
we go forward.
<br>
<p>Hal
