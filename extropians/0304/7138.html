Rafal said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Since our data on either the likelihood of spontaneous life emergence, or
<br>
the future of average sentient interest development, or the actual
<br>
cumulative extinction risk for a civilization of our type, are woefully
<br>
inadequate, the optimist and the pessimist will reach their conclusions
<br>
according to their predilections, while the Bayesian will not conclude
<br>
anything at all, aside from the need to search for new knowledge and to
<br>
carefully incorporate it in his reasoning. ,&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not in favor of considering the search for extra terrestrial 
<br>
intelligence, the focus of a mathematician, nor even a philosopher. It is, 
<br>
however, the focus of the astronomer. Astronomy seems to indicate an early 
<br>
cosmos, one that is under 15 billion years old, to be a cosmos that is ladden 
<br>
with gamma ray bursters, and comet and meteor strikes. As activities cool 
<br>
down, multicelluar life arises, and develops, and through natural evolution, 
<br>
and a lot of time, produces intelligence. With intelligence, we have 
<br>
technology. Why not just consider this early universe, as one that is too 
<br>
much the frying pan, too much in harms' way for intelligence to develop?
<br>
<p>To parapharse Lord Arthur C. Clarke, in the his work, The Lost Worlds of 
<br>
2001, we are, like the aliens in the novel, set against the after-glow of 
<br>
creation, facing a lonely universe. Fits the bill anyway. We have our work 
<br>
cut out for us, as a species, and a trans species, awaiting their birth from 
<br>
our genes and our brains. But that's where the fun is! Mayhaps, we get to 
<br>
help re-shape reality, or at least, our little corner of it.
