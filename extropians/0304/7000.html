Not exactly.  He's an anthropologist using a fictional form for 
<br>
reporting on field studies.  (Or at least that's where he started.  I 
<br>
never got past the second volume, but properly interpreted he's making 
<br>
accurate, though not literal, statements about the relationship between 
<br>
the known and the unknown.  Somewhat interesting, but not really very 
<br>
deep unless you are asserting that this is the view of one group of 
<br>
people [they were supposed to be field notes].)  I understand that he 
<br>
was a student of Garfinkle in UCLA, and was a bit surprised by the 
<br>
popularity of the fictional version.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;To quote Robert Anton Wilson,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Reality may not only be weirder than we think, but weirder than we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;think.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not only stolen by Wilson but mangled. The original famous quip (by J. B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;S. Haldane decades earlier) was:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;`The universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*can* suppose.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That was intentional, and you were expected to recognize the 
<br>
paraphrase.  (It is, as you justly note, famous.)  If you take Wilson at 
<br>
face value, you are misunderstanding him.  He deeply admires James 
<br>
Joyce, esp. Finnegan's Wake.  As a result, he tries to make everything 
<br>
multi-ordinal.  I fequently feel that he goes a bit beyond optimum in 
<br>
this direction, but that's my aesthetic.  If you look at all carefully, 
<br>
you will find a large number of &quot;mangled&quot; quotes.  This is an attempt to 
<br>
represent the mind as a  processing of culture.  It is intentionally not 
<br>
a perfect mirror, as the mind does not create a perfect reflection of 
<br>
culture.  And it intentionally contains a large percentage of &quot;famous&quot; 
<br>
ideas.  That is the mind acting as a mirror of culture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&quot;If you think you know what the hell's going on, you're probably full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;s***&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you think people can turn into birds and balls of light, you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*definitely* full of shit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
OTOH, there may well be ideas which are best expressed via that 
<br>
metaphor.  (I don't know the context, but if you are referring to either 
<br>
Castenada or Wilson, suspect that metaphor rather than an attempt to 
<br>
depict physical reality is what's going on.)
