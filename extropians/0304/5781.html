On Sat, 5 Apr 2003, Harvey Newstrom commenting on my comments on copies wrote:
<br>
<p>(Oh Harvey -- you raise a host of complex issues which is why I suppose
<br>
I hang out on this list).  Its going to be a toss-up today whether you
<br>
or Anders get the prize for creating the most worthwhile stuff to talk
<br>
about (though he was delivering abstracts so its not clearly an original
<br>
work product).
<br>
<p>First,
<br>
<em>&gt; What happens to one copy may not happen to the other copy.
</em><br>
<p>Oh but you can't assume this.  If I can make 1000 copies of RJB
<br>
I think I might be quite tempted to produce a collective mind
<br>
(it is essential to beat the hazard function -- repeat after me
<br>
&quot;distributed replicated intelligence&quot;).  The logical step beyond
<br>
that is a highly interconnected &quot;distributed replicated intelligence&quot;.
<br>
<p>Once one can do this all of the information and experiences become &quot;shared&quot;.
<br>
Now this becomes somewhat problematic since if there are 1000 copies
<br>
of me, someone somewhere is probably experiencing an orgasm with
<br>
a fair amount of frequency and that is going to make it rather
<br>
difficult for the other minds in the collective to get some
<br>
productive work done.  So some filtering seems likely.  Then one
<br>
gets into whether the sender or the receiver is doing the filtering.
<br>
Very complex problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As such, they each have a different point-of-view.
</em><br>
<p>Only limited by the degree to which they are restricting input.
<br>
An &quot;individual&quot; can break itself off from the &quot;collective&quot; but
<br>
as soon as it does that it is dooming itself to mortality.
<br>
No way out of this box (at least that I've seen yet).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Making a duplicate copy does not change the point-of-view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original.
</em><br>
<p>Hard to say -- it depends on ones &quot;beliefs&quot; with respect to
<br>
the original.  If I'm reading/recalling the postings correctly
<br>
I think Harvey/Lee might assert this but Damien might not.
<br>
This comes up in &quot;The Saga of the Cuckoo&quot; -- ones perspective
<br>
on cost-free copying becomes a little jaded if one suspects
<br>
the fate of the copies isn't very pretty.
<br>
<p>That is a key issue that Lee and I (and others) need to focus
<br>
on if we get this teleportation paper written.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The original point-of-view still grow old and dies or is destroyed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the destructive copy scenario.
</em><br>
<p>No. Provided one doesn't create more copies faster than your
<br>
information capacity expands there is no reason to lose any
<br>
old/original &quot;point-of-views&quot; -- it gets into precisely the
<br>
problem that many people face today with their computers --
<br>
(&quot;Which of these files do I no longer need any more and can
<br>
be deleted?&quot;).
<br>
<p>(I'm assuming the &quot;destructive&quot; copy isn't really &quot;destructive&quot; --
<br>
after all if you can reassemble a copy of the original someplace
<br>
else you can reassemble the original where they were disassembled
<br>
and that if you can do this disassembly/reassembly that the
<br>
concepts of growing old and death are obsolete.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That point-of-view never is modified to achieve immortality.  It is only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newly created point-of-view that experiences immortality.
</em><br>
<p>This seems to assume there is never a collective intelligence
<br>
that does not need to be copied/teleported to achieve &quot;immortality&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may &quot;remember&quot; being mortal in that we have programmed it with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy of all the memories from the original, but it never actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced them.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, now I think you are treading on very thin ice -- attempting to
<br>
differentiate &quot;memories&quot; from &quot;experiences&quot;.  If the molecular
<br>
reassembly is &quot;identical&quot; how can these be differentiated (other
<br>
than in the mind if one happens to know one is a replicant?).
<br>
<p>An experience *is* a memory I don't see one escaping from that easily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One is mortal and is never saved.
</em><br>
<p>If one does not form a distributed replicated intelligence one is
<br>
mortal.  End of discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One is immortal and was never in danger.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but there are *different* forms of distributed replicated
<br>
intelligence(s) that one may adopt -- this has significant affects
<br>
on how one thinks, acts, accumulates knowledge, experiences, etc.
<br>
<p>The dominant choices may significantly effect the direction of the
<br>
evolution of our civilization.  They are not trivial choices.
<br>
