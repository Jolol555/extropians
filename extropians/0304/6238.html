Mike Lorrey writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And while I don't share his pessimism, I certainly do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agree with his concern that the present idiot-in-chief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isn't ready to handle success.
</em><br>
<p>I'm continually appalled at the negative &quot;cult of personality&quot;
<br>
on this list.  Evidently most people think that Bush runs the
<br>
government entirely on his own, as a sort of telepathic slaver
<br>
over all the millions of government functionaries.  No matter
<br>
how many times the entrenched bureaucrats in the various
<br>
departments are referred to, nor no matter how many times the
<br>
president's advisors (Rumsfeld, Rice, Powell, etc.) and their
<br>
staffs are referred to, it just doesn't matter:  the refrain
<br>
is always the same:  George Bush doesn't have the I.Q. to do
<br>
the job (whether it's &quot;managing&quot; the economy, or &quot;conducting&quot;
<br>
foreign affairs).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However I believe, and hope, that wiser minds can prevail and turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our symbolic victory today into something real and long-term.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd pit any one of Bush's crew against the entire combined IQ of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-war Hollywoodites.
</em><br>
<p>Mike, it's pretty useless.  These references to Bush's crew fall
<br>
upon deaf ears.  Those who have a low opinion of George Bush's
<br>
personal characteristics are determined to perceive all of U.S.
<br>
policy as an extension of that particular mind and will.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In particular, I'm glad the Brits are there.  They might have a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; record as imperialist dogs, but right now that's what Iraq needs:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone who is experienced in bringing order to a conquered people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hopefully they are now enlightened enough to then give them their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; independence without the need of a revolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British experience in bringing order to conquered people usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved lots of executions, imprisonments, and forced exile.
</em><br>
<p>How sure are you that such were not necessary in the 19th century
<br>
when dealing with primitive populations?  A lot is made in the
<br>
discussions right now about how well it went in Japan and Germany
<br>
after the war, even though they were vastly less appreciative of
<br>
what the invaders had accomplished.
<br>
<p>Well, the reason is extremely simple:  Iraq far more closely
<br>
resembles the 19th century nations that Britain administered
<br>
than it does Japan or Germany, whose citizens were already
<br>
quite used to working together in a modern society.  How much
<br>
looting took place in Frankfurt after allied liberation?
<br>
<p>The looting will stop only when the five or ten of Iraqis
<br>
inclined to take personal advantage of the situation are
<br>
fearful of drastic punishment.  The enlightened leaders of
<br>
the West are not capable of providing that level of fear,
<br>
and a repressive civilian authority sooner or later will
<br>
be established.  (Hopefully sooner, and hopefully far less
<br>
repressive than Saddam's regime had been.)
<br>
<p>As for the title of this thread, I do not believe that there
<br>
are any &quot;predictable stupidities&quot; concerning the present 
<br>
situation.  The only thing close to predictable is the continued
<br>
naivety of many people who think that the situation is simple,
<br>
&quot;if only&quot; people of noble intentions and good character were
<br>
in charge in Washington.
<br>
<p>Lee
