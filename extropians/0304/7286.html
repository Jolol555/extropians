</em><br>
<p>I guess one common source of errors is data from different times. GNP
<br>
and population changes. Measuring land mass is also surprisingly
<br>
nonconstant. In coastal areas it can change quite a bit. Even worse, it
<br>
often depends on how you count, and many economic and population 
<br>
estimates are just estimates - which can be heavily biased by 
<br>
governments and organizations selecting the &quot;right&quot; way of measuring (or 
<br>
just selecting a particular approach with no real intent).
<br>
<p>And people copy bad statistics. Bjorn Lomborg did a good job of showing 
<br>
just how skewed environmental statistics could be by selective 
<br>
re-telling, and once you have a dramatic statement like &quot;We are losing 
<br>
forest at the rate of X football fields per second&quot; or &quot;We only use 10% 
<br>
of our brains&quot; they rapidly spread. Scientific papers commonly refer to 
<br>
other papers the authors have never read, but copy the references to 
<br>
from other papers. And so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What can be done about this? Is there programs that could either change the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; info or tell the page/page owner that the info is wrong. Is this something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will be around until AI can deal with it?
</em><br>
<p>If you have a particularly specific or bad factoid, you could always 
<br>
search for it and email pages with it. It could even be automated, but 
<br>
you would likely be spamming people just referring to it (a search for 
<br>
&quot;we only use 10% of our brains&quot; gave 211 hits on google, and all hits on 
<br>
the first page debunked it). A more specific number &quot;China GNP 4389 
<br>
billion&quot; might work better, but it is still error-prone. 
<br>
<p>I wonder if AI could deal with it either. As discussed below, many 
<br>
statements are semantically fuzzy. I might say an erroneous number on a 
<br>
page, but the exact number doesn't matter (&quot;Even if China has billions 
<br>
of citizens, it doesn't make it a democracy&quot; - China does not have more 
<br>
than 2 billion inhabitants, but that doesn't change the meaning of the 
<br>
reasoning). The AI must understand such loose usage, and when the writer 
<br>
is stupid or writes confusedly (perhaps in a second language) it can be 
<br>
practically impossible to deal with it.
<br>
<p>I am reminded of Babbage's letter to Tennyson: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi879.htm">http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi879.htm</a>
<br>
<p>However, a system like the semantic web could make attempts to use 
<br>
information deliberately and exactly more manageable. Also, by stating 
<br>
sources for everything debugging of data can be done. If we had good 
<br>
tools for writing such pages, then I think automated factcheckers could 
<br>
be used at least to point out that certain facts are contentious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do search engines work so screwed up? I just know basic programming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could someone explain to me why there are all these problems?
</em><br>
<p>In what way are they screwed up? 
<br>
<p>I get the impression you want them to produce correct and 
<br>
relevant information. But how do you tell them what is correct and 
<br>
relevant? It is not a programming problem, it is a problem definition 
<br>
problem. And the things we as users want are usually extremely ill 
<br>
defined. 
<br>
<p>Looking at my latest google searches, the first six are attempts at 
<br>
finding a particular website by using variations of its title. Then 
<br>
there is a name of a historical person that I wanted to understand a 
<br>
reference to. Then a search for &quot;billion trillion&quot; to remind myself of 
<br>
which is which in British and American english. Then there is a search 
<br>
for a newspaper I was interviewed in. Then several book titles, where I 
<br>
was looking for price estimates and reviews. And a search for another 
<br>
journal, where I used a word in the title I knew would produce a correct 
<br>
hit. 
<br>
<p>Now look at this from the perspective of the search engine. The first
<br>
group was trying to match a title or header consisting of fairly common
<br>
words. The second is a search for a name, which ideally should give a
<br>
bio or homepage. Then there was a search for two terms that should occur
<br>
together, but there was no indication of what kind of page was wanted -
<br>
it was just implicit that I wanted one with a linguistic comparision. 
<br>
The newspaper search consisted of little more than &quot;biotechnology
<br>
journal&quot;, and should have brought up journals with the literal name
<br>
&quot;Biotechnology&quot; rather than biotechnology journals (it wasn't a very
<br>
precise search). The book title searches had a common context
<br>
(considering buying them), so I wanted only certain kinds of pages - but
<br>
how could the engine know? And finally I asked for a very common word
<br>
(&quot;Register&quot;) because I knew it would dig up &quot;The Register&quot; - but from
<br>
the search engine point of view I might have been looking for the
<br>
National Register, where to register, the registers of the Z80 processor
<br>
or a registrar.  And things get even worse when someone searches for
<br>
&quot;How do I make bar graphs in matlab with error bars?&quot; - unless there is
<br>
a page with that sentence it is hard to separate it from pages with
<br>
Matlab manuals listing both bar graphs and errorplots. 
<br>
<p>To sum up, even this kind of simple keyword-based searching is awfully 
<br>
messy. I'm amazed by the skill of the people of Google and similar 
<br>
places in making their engines able to dig up roughly the right pages. 
<br>
But we need engines that can really search for semantics, and not just 
<br>
clear semantics like &quot;What is the GNP of China?&quot; but also unclear and 
<br>
confused semantics like &quot;Journals with a biotech name that interviewed 
<br>
me&quot;. That is a programming challenge.
