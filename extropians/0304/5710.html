<p>Evidently not sufficiently!  You're still responding to some

of these posts!  ;-)

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; curious as to who lines up in the &quot;teleportation&quot; line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and who lines up in the &quot;get your arm broken 10 times&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing like reality to test a hypothesis.
</em><br>
<p>To be truthful, a number of people indeed *would* get in the
<br>
&quot;break your arm ten times&quot; line, because they'd see the other
<br>
line as certain death.
<br>
<p>There should be three (3) cases where you are given the
<br>
experience whether you like it or not.  (Credit for prior
<br>
experience is given---if you have teleported before, you
<br>
don't have to, and if you have suffered bodily pain before,
<br>
you can choose not to get your arm broken.)
<br>
<p>I think that since teleportation is a new technology,
<br>
if you teleported three times, some little instinct in
<br>
you would say &quot;Well, that didn't hurt so much.&quot;  And
<br>
when you went on with a lot of silly verbalization (&quot;Well,
<br>
I have to remember that I'm not the same person any more&quot;),
<br>
even your body would rebel.
<br>
<p>Worse, if some people whose ethics are below mine get hold
<br>
of the Extro 13 operation, people might continually have
<br>
their atoms exchanged by machinery hidden in the walls, so
<br>
that in effect one is duplicated 10^4 times per second.
<br>
<p>Or we might just hold Extro 13 at L5, and the only way to
<br>
go there is to teleport.  Think it would be a large, or a
<br>
small, get together?
<br>
