</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I guess the website that I am part of would have to be one of those

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is <a href="http://www.universaltransparency.org">http://www.universaltransparency.org</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, I have obviously given this great thought, and I think that there
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably some midway point that would work. For example, one of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible implementations would be a society where there was great
</em><br>
Universal
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transparency wherever there are advanced technologies like nano or
</em><br>
biotech
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or even some easier techs. But from there, we could have refuges where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; privacy was respected to different levels. For example, a commons where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone enters and is checked at the door, like nightclubs today where
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have metal detectors. Inside this common area, most anything goes, the
</em><br>
laws
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are liberal, and there are places where there are no cameras. Perhaps we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would live in apartments that have a private room that we can take
</em><br>
nothing
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into that could be weaponized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As often is the case, both sides will probably need to compromise.
</em><br>
Privacy
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advocates have to realize that privacy can be abused, transparency
</em><br>
advocates
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the general public (like 80% of Americans, who have &quot;nothing to
</em><br>
hide&quot; )
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have to appreciate that privacy is not just used to hide illegal things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I think that if laws were rewritten to decriminalize and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destigmatize sex, drugs, gambling and other personal choice issues, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transparency would be much easier to implement. Of course, the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; administration is moving in the other direction, so that is not too good
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sign! Even if these laws were rewritten, there are other reasons for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; privacy, or other concerns that need to be addressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The main problem I see it today is that privacy advocates are not
</em><br>
willing to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; give an inch on privacy, but whether we like it or not, the police state
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coming. Rather than fight it, we should work to make it fair and just,
</em><br>
as it
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a train that we cannot stop, nor should we as it serves a purpose, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; catch Terrorists etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the police state is coming &quot;whether we like it or not&quot; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal transparency (universal surveillance) has serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems as you partially touched upon.  These include:
</em><br>
<p>An alternative to a police state is Anarchy by many gods. This might be the
<br>
worst of all possible options. When each of us can kill a million people
<br>
with technology in an instant, people will beg for order.
<br>
<p>In terms of a police state, this can happen in many different ways, from
<br>
rather fair to totalitarian. I actually advocate a police state where the
<br>
police are all of us, rather than the government. The power of Transparency
<br>
is distributed as much as possible, so as to not allow one small group to
<br>
control everything. I think the term police state and concept are at one end
<br>
of the spectrum . I would advocate a self policed system with liberal
<br>
attitudes towards self expression, freedom, and some privacy, but with
<br>
extreme prejudice towwards those that would kill or try to opress others.
<br>
Ideally, and realistically, I think a system could occur that allows
<br>
individuals to do many things that they choose as long as they do not
<br>
directly harm others. I live in San Francisco where self expression is
<br>
probably the highest anywhere in the world, this occurs becuase of a
<br>
constitution that protects individuals.
<br>
<p>So I am not advocating a &quot;police state&quot; rather a self policed distributed
<br>
democracy witha strong constitution perhaps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) It will not be universal in that the powers that be will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be subject to it.  Look how easily the current US administration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threw out or ignores many existing oversight laws.
</em><br>
<p>We do not have Universal Transparency now, we have more than most countries,
<br>
but much less than could be possible. The trend clearly is towards
<br>
transparency and distributed power. We are more free than our ancestors of
<br>
200 years ago, and they are better than 1000 years ago. Thereality of today
<br>
should not stop us from progressing forwards.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) There is no clear way to force compliance, especially on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of government;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Perhaps,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Universal surveillance = Universal Enforcement/Control -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no way to &quot;opt out&quot; of bad law if surveillance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total.  There is no way to do an uprising against an unjust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government as it will be seen and squashed in its weak/early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stages so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The goal as I see it is to create a government that is as just as possible.
<br>
I doubt any system could be 100% effective, so a brutal government, even
<br>
with great powers of surveillance would be a target of many powerful gods
<br>
attempting to destroy it. America is more just than most countries, so even
<br>
today while many of its citizens have great power, few attempt to destroy
<br>
it. Governments do not atomatically have to be coercive and oppresive. A
<br>
benign government that tries to spread good will to all, and stop
<br>
terrorists, would probably suffer less attacks (and therefore be more fit)
<br>
than a government with bad laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) Universal surveillance = universal stagnation - besides the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above the laws will most likely be made by powered interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or the people and/or arbitrary doctrines (theocracy anyone).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universal surveillance would be workable only if all humans, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least all decision makers were enlightened.  This is clearly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case and not doable.  Given democracy + universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surveillance the result is a lowest common denominator effect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed behavior.  Any group that fears any change/innovation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and can sway the deciding parties gets to dictate to all.  Where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will radical innovation and change come from in such a state?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Decision makers are often more enlightened than the rest of the public. Not
<br>
all decision makers, but many. Even though it appears that there is a bit of
<br>
a theocracy right now, there are many republicans who would probably give
<br>
their lives to prevent an American Theocracy. I have some friends who served
<br>
in the Military, they put their lives on the line for Truth Freedom and the
<br>
American way (or is that Superman), at any rate, they are NOT Christian
<br>
warriors.
<br>
<p>I have a great concern that the present or future administration will try to
<br>
persecute people who are involved in sex and drugs. However, I think that it
<br>
would be tough if more transparency and honesty occured, becuase then we
<br>
would see that our leaders did these things as well (Republicans are into
<br>
BDSM much more than democrats!). Larry Flint forced transparency on the
<br>
Government.
<br>
<p>Radical innovation needs to be controlled! It has gotten us this far, put
<br>
just like a tree or animals growth, there usually is some phase of
<br>
maturation. Radical innovation is equivalent to uncontrolled growth =
<br>
cancer. There is enogh labs and people working on innovation today that it
<br>
needs little help to continue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is nothing &quot;fair and just&quot; about a police state.  Not ever.
</em><br>
<p>A semi fair and semi just tranparent democracy is better than the
<br>
alternative, a world of anarchy, where individuals hold the power of killing
<br>
in their hands. I like Government in some ways, police have come to my
<br>
rescue when other threatened me with violence.
<br>
<p>The main question I ask myself is &quot;How do we protect ourselves from weapons
<br>
of mass destruction&quot;? The main answer I come up with involves more
<br>
surveillance, it can be a police state, enforced on us, or it can be a self
<br>
policed system with as much justice as possible while still providing
<br>
security.
