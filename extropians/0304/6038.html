<p>
I think that much of the information floating around about Trusted
<br>
Computing technology is incorrect or misleading.  I first learned about
<br>
this stuff last year when some of the early alarmist reports came out.
<br>
I studied the TCPA spec, bought a book on TCPA, and I've learned what
<br>
I could about Microsoft's Palladium, although there has been less
<br>
information about that.
<br>
<p>Let me explain what is Trusted Computing (TC) and basically how it works.
<br>
The idea is to set up a computer so that a third party not sitting in
<br>
front of it can trust how it will behave.  This does not mean that the
<br>
third party owns the computer or has complete control over it.  It means
<br>
that he can become convinced that the computer is going to behave in a
<br>
predictable way.  That means in practice that he can be convinced about
<br>
what program it is going to run, and that the program has a certain
<br>
immunity to having its code or data inspected or changed.
<br>
<p>Let's talk about uploads for a moment before I go into detail about TC.
<br>
Suppose you were an upload, and were about to transfer your program to
<br>
a remote system.  You'd be putting yourself at the mercy of the owner
<br>
of that system, wouldn't you?  Suppose he turned out to be malicious,
<br>
and wanted to inflict pain, or turn you into a slave.  How could you
<br>
protect yourself against that?
<br>
<p>TC is how.  You'd need to gain assurance that the remote computer was
<br>
running a standard, well-understood and well-behaved program that would
<br>
receive your data and run it unmolested.  You would need to *trust* the
<br>
remote computer to behave in a *specified manner*.  That is precisely
<br>
the mission statement for Trusted Computing!
<br>
<p>Now I'll say more about how TC works.  As I said, the goal is to be able
<br>
to assure a remote system that a particular program is running and that
<br>
the program can protect itself and its data.
<br>
<p>The way this is achieved is via some secure hardware associated with the
<br>
computer, which has a few functions.  One is that the hardware can take a
<br>
&quot;fingerprint&quot; (a cryptographic hash) of software which will use the secure
<br>
functionality.  This fingerprint can be used in a couple of ways.  First,
<br>
it can be reported via a cryptographic signature to remote machines.
<br>
This is what allows the remote machines to be convinced about what program
<br>
is running - because they learn the digital fingerprint of the software.
<br>
And second, this fingerprint can be used to &quot;lock&quot; (encrypt) data, such
<br>
that the data can only be decryped by the same program running with
<br>
the same fingerprint.  No other program, or no altered version of this
<br>
program, can decrypt the data.
<br>
<p>Two points follow from this, which I will explain further in a moment.
<br>
The first is that this suffices to achieve many of the goals of TC,
<br>
including protection of sensitive content, digital rights management, and
<br>
more immunity to viruses.  And the second is that it is *not* necessary
<br>
for Microsoft or anyone else to approve or limit the programs which can
<br>
run in this trusted mode.  Microsoft cannot shut down programs or delete
<br>
files off of trusted computers.  There is no need for them to have this
<br>
ability in order to achieve the goals of trusted computing.
<br>
<p>The way in which this functionality achieves the goals of TC is by
<br>
letting third parties know what program is running.  Keep in mind that
<br>
this doesn't mean they can snoop on your system arbitrarily; rather,
<br>
your programs can prove to remote servers what is running, by asking
<br>
the secure hardware to send a cryptographically signed message that
<br>
describes the fingerprint of the running program.  This allows, for
<br>
example, a content server to only download content to programs that it
<br>
trusts to handle the content reliably.  It allows a government security
<br>
agency to similarly require that, say, email is only exchanged between
<br>
secure email programs, because each one can check what program is running
<br>
at the other side and refuse to connect to it.
<br>
<p>Another app might be for an online game, the server can make sure that
<br>
each user is running a &quot;legal&quot; game client and not one that cheats.
<br>
Auction services could use similar technology.  Likewise for SETI@Home
<br>
and similar semi-competitive distributed computing efforts, which have
<br>
been plagued by cheaters.  This could also be a foundation for more
<br>
commercial forms of distributed computing, where sensitive calculations
<br>
could be farmed out to end-user computers, and the distributors would
<br>
have greater assurance that users couldn't get access to the data that
<br>
they were being paid to process, or falsely claim that they were owed
<br>
for work they hadn't done.
<br>
<p>As far as viruses, the idea is that once a program has locked some data,
<br>
if a virus comes along and infects another program, it won't be able to
<br>
get access to the data.  Even if it infects the same program that locked
<br>
it, that will change its fingerprint and so not even that program will
<br>
be able to get at the data.  This won't stop viruses but it could limit
<br>
the damage they could cause.
<br>
<p>For the second point above, the claim that only Microsoft-approved code
<br>
will run, note that all that is necessary is for the TC hardware to be
<br>
able to take a hash of the program, and to report it.  Programs that use
<br>
this functionality do not have to be signed by Microsoft or anyone else.
<br>
Even though we may call these &quot;trusted&quot; programs, they don't have any
<br>
special powers.  The sense in which they are &quot;trusted&quot; is that they can
<br>
get their hashes reported elsewhere, so that those people can decide
<br>
whether to trust them.
<br>
<p>There is no central party who decides which programs are trusted.  Rather,
<br>
each application area, even each individual user, would ultimately decide
<br>
whether to trust a program for a particular purpose.  And these judgements
<br>
are made with respect to programs running on *other people's* computers.
<br>
I would get to decide whether I want to trust a program running on your
<br>
computer for some purpose, and vice versa.  Sony would get to decide
<br>
whether to trust a program running on your computer for downloading
<br>
its music catalog.  Maxis would get to decide whether to trust the Sims
<br>
software running on your computer for connecting to its game server.
<br>
<p>Each computer makes its own decision about who to trust.  It's not
<br>
Microsoft, for indeed, the potential scope of this technology is so
<br>
large that it would hardly be possible for Microsoft to decide for each
<br>
program whether or not it was in some sense &quot;trustworthy&quot;.  They want this
<br>
to be used in a big way.  Having to do a code review for each program
<br>
would increase their costs enormously, would open them up to liability,
<br>
and is completely unnecessary in order to achieve the properties of
<br>
Trusted Computing.
<br>
<p>Based on my understanding of the technology, there is no need to fear
<br>
that uploads running on a Palladium system would imply that Microsoft
<br>
&quot;owned&quot; all the people and could kill them at any time.  The ability
<br>
to take a secure fingerprint of a program does not imply the ability to
<br>
kill the program!  TC as I understand it is a technology for information
<br>
protection, not for destruction.  It allows applications to extend trust
<br>
to remote systems, and to save their data immune from molestation by
<br>
other programs.
<br>
<p>Obviously the story I have told here is very much at odds with what
<br>
you will have heard about TCPA/Palladium/NGSCB elsewhere on the net.
<br>
I can't really account for that discrepancy.  I don't understand why my
<br>
reading of the technology's properties and capabilities is so different
<br>
from everyone else's.  It's possible that there are non-public documents
<br>
which paint a much more sinister picture.  All I can say is that based
<br>
on the public information, TC works as I have described it here.
