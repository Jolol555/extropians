<p><em>&gt; &gt; Which, iirc, led to the establishment (or possibly just a period of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I actually created it [the exi-freedom list] a while prior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Shoutout at the ExI Corral, and did invite those of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the anti-G*n side to participate there, with only the caveat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they had to only speak facts and truth (few, if any,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takers, from that side).  What ended the problem of gun-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic list pollution [sic], though, was the departure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one very serious anti-gun troll from the Extropians list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who I have since determined does have the connections I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspected him of having back then.
</em><br>
<p><p>Okay---standing back a long way from that, how does it come
<br>
to pass that anyone can become SO VERY passionate in an
<br>
email debate?  Didn't you once say that someone had written
<br>
1200 posts, or something, and targeted certain persons?
<br>
<p>There have been times when I've been weirdly extreme myself
<br>
(though not to that extent).  We even have at the present
<br>
time one or two people, I think, who have taken it upon them-
<br>
selves to bombard the list with posts as a part of their
<br>
&quot;cause&quot;.  Knowing full well that your words might apply to
<br>
yourself as well as me, do you nonetheless now, from a
<br>
relatively detached vantage point have any understanding
<br>
of the phenomenon?
