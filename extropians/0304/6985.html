Seems like such a formula would be easy to spin in the other direction.
<br>
Luddites warning of technological risks but secretly involved in nasty plots
<br>
for their own greedy purposes.  Technologies hero obviously smart but
<br>
not listened to.  Just in time some disaster is averted by the technology
<br>
heroes using the feared technology.  Luddites are incidentally killed due
<br>
to their own stupidity (or grudgingly accept new technology).  Seems like
<br>
I have seen a few movies like this.  But someone might do well by
<br>
specifically copying Chrichton's style.
<br>
<p>I like some of the Luddite ideas.  They provide a balance to our enthusiasm.
<br>
Some people just will not form opinions until they have seen it spun both
<br>
ways.  Perhaps Ludites are necessary for rapid progress.  As for bad
<br>
science (or other factual discrepancies) in fiction, oh well, it happens.
<br>

Subject: Prey (was RE: Fiction Books)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The book is bloody awful. It's the horrid Chrichton combination of
</em><br>
hideously
<br>
<em>&gt; bad plot that only seems plausible/non-contrived to people who know SFA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the subject matter (ie: practically everyone), combined with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly readable style that makes it impossible to stop reading once
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; begin (like watching daytime soaps).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's the worst of intellectual junk food masquerading as a banquet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it's much worse than that. Chrichton is an arch-luddite. I've read
</em><br>
Prey
<br>
<em>&gt; and Timeline recently (yes I'm an idiot), and his standard plot seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Startup technology company has a big idea. They develop it in secret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Enough detail is laid out about the technology, and the background, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince the lay reader that Chrichton knows his stuff. So the reader may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel free to accept that he/she is reading Truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - We get to see the detail of the secret labs in which the technology is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even now being operated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - All technology is fundamentally bad, and corrupting. Tech company top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; execs are corrupted and turn out to be the bad guys, this is hinted at
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; the start (although is it really necessary... after all, it's obvious,
</em><br>
isn't
<br>
<em>&gt; it?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - So the technology, which had some excellent promise, ends up having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential to Destroy Everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The story unfolds, and we find the true evil in the tech company's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach - a combination of hubris, greed, and lack of due care.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The hero, who has known all along that this technology is too dangerous
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; tinker with, and been marginalised by all and sundry as a naysayer, now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes control. &quot;We must stop it before it is too late&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - At this point, the superficial attempt at a consistent plot based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual science goes directly out the window.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Cue killer monsters, showdowns with evil tech execs, smaller explosions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits of roof falling in, and the heroes saving everyone just in time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Evil tech exec's base/headquarters explode, likely with them inside. Or,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they get their come-uppance in some other horrible but ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just-desserts implying way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Epilogue - whew, we did it just in time. See, technology X is really
</em><br>
bad,
<br>
<em>&gt; well, all technology is really bad, really.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - End of screenplay (I mean book).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Prey&quot; is a novel of monumental stupidity. Chrichton absolutely twists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; himself in knots, combining really interesting stuff - nanotech
</em><br>
replicators,
<br>
<em>&gt; distributed agent software, evolutionary algorithms - and melodramatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil tech execs to come up with... Raptors. His take on nanotech gone
</em><br>
wrong
<br>
<em>&gt; are nanotech swarms that behave like killer dinosaurs: they replicate,
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; hunt in packs, they even behave exactly like predatory killers (because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's how they were programmed, but gosh, they are evolving even smarter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tactics!). And, wow, was I ever surprised when it turned out that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotech macro-critters were reproducing by consuming mammalian flesh! Oh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dear!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will note that Chrichton sold the rights to the movie of Prey before
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; book was published (indeed, before it was written I'll wager). The book
</em><br>
(and
<br>
<em>&gt; Timeline) read like they were written to a cynical formula (technology
</em><br>
gone
<br>
<em>&gt; bad, symptomatic of the evils of the modern world), designed solely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeal to the uninformed as a movie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Timeline annoyed me in a different way; it's just so boneheaded that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unbelievable. Granted, the timetravel in the novel is just an excuse to
</em><br>
put
<br>
<em>&gt; modern characters in the 14th century and play knights (I wonder why no
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; ever thought of that before), but really. This is a novel where the tense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; climax plays out as the people in the present day rush to fix their time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine apparatus in time, before the people in the past run out of time
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; can't come back. We get to see lots of parallel stuff - This is what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening Now, in the past; this is what's happening Now, in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a race against time, across time. If only they had a f*cking time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine! Cretinous. The guy is not a sci-fi writer's scrotum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may have noticed that I'm pretty pissed off with Chrichton and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novels. The reason is that he is a thriller writer, masquarading as a
</em><br>
sci-fi
<br>
<em>&gt; writer, masquerading as a serious science writer. The implication at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times is that Chrichton has researched his material, and that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel/movie is a serious warning to the people about the dangers of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hidden new technologies. We must stop them all before it's too late! And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people believe this bastard, who I am betting couldn't actually give two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shits about technologies like cloning, genetic manipulation, nanotech, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (saints preserve us) pseudo time travelling through the quantum foam. He's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hit on a formula that will continue to make him an extremely rich man, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all it requires is to publish dangerously, often deliberately misinformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novels one after the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I'm overreacting. It's just that, when I see mention of cloning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thylocine, or stem cell research, or Dolly the sheep, I can usually count
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; a reference to Jurassic Park. People believe this crap. Our lives are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affected by it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next time you hear of someone who could benefit from stem-cell
</em><br>
technologies,
<br>
<em>&gt; except that progress hasn't been what it should, what with banning of part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or all of it across the western world, think of Jurrassic Park, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chrichton. And ponder what effect Prey, the movie, will have on this world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I think I'll boycott it, and rent an old copy of Superman,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead.

<em>&gt; &gt; My girlfriend just last night finished the fiction book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; _Prey_ by Michael
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Crichton. While reading it over the last week or two she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spoke to me in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; general about the suspenseful &quot;white knuckle&quot; situations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the plot. She's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; raving about it now. She says that given her knowledge of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interests I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; must read it immediately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The book is about some sort of nanotech experiment gone wrong.
