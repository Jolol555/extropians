<em>&gt; (gts &lt;<a href="mailto:gts_2000@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20evolution%20and%20diet">gts_2000@yahoo.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this is exactly the kind of comment that differentiates those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are interested in diet from those like you who seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested [in] arguing just for argument's sake.
</em><br>
<p>In the long run, refining the methods by which we acquire and evaluate
<br>
information are far more important than how we happen to fuel our
<br>
present form; but of course I am interested in that as well for the
<br>
short-term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is /mountains/ of evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the health benefits of dairy, grains, and beans, and gts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knows this as well as anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I do not know this, Lee. There is no evidence that I've seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that dairy, grains and legumes are healthy additions to the diet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given that one must subtract paleo foods from the diet in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to add them,...
</em><br>
<p>I agree with that statement, which has nothing to do with what I said.
<br>
I said that there were mountains of evidence for the health benefits
<br>
of dairy, grains, and legumes, and there are. You are correct that if
<br>
I add your additional &quot;given&quot;, then most if not all of those studies
<br>
fall. But I find it interesting that you think adding that condition
<br>
produces more valuable data, because the condition assumes paleo diet
<br>
as a baseline, which is exactly what we're trying to establish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you disagree then don't be an ass: just post your evidence.
</em><br>
<p>As I said, I don't disagree with your statement: it merely has nothing
<br>
to do with mine, and isn't as reliable a metric as you seem to think
<br>
it is.  It should hardly be necessary for me to support /my/ statement
<br>
that dairy, grains, and legumes have health benefits: we've all heard
<br>
them for years. But just to be fair, here's a few I happened to grab
<br>
in five minutes of googling around the USDA (yes, they all fail to
<br>
meet /your/ standard, but that's what we're trying to make sense of):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of the American Dietetic Association, 2002
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teens who didn't drink milk at all fell short of the daily
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommended Dietary Intake of vitamin A and three minerals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;essential for healthy bones--calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of the American College of Nutrition, 2002
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans who eat meals high in carbohydrate (particularly whole grains)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consume less fat, carry less fat on their bodies, and achieve more of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the daily recommended intakes for essential nutrients.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer, Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, 2000
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whey and soy protein in the diet may help guard against breast cancer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Regional Research Center, 1999
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rice bran, wheat bran may have cancer-protective effects similar to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oat bran when processed properly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Western Human Nutrition Research Center, 2002
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New moms who eat more carbohydrates in relation to fats during the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months they are breastfeeding may have higher levels of leptin in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their blood, which may help prevent retention of extra weight.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of Nutrition, 2001
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estrogen-like compounds in soybeans may reduce hot flashes and vaginal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dryness and increase bone density in women after menopause.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy protein lowers men's cholesterol.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of Pediatrics, 2001
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calcium-fortified cereals improve kids' calcium absorption without
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harming iron absorption.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of Pediatrics, 2000
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teens who reported diets rich in fiber (including whole grains and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beans) and low in total fat consumed more vitamins and minerals and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less total cholesterol and saturated fat than their peers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, 1999
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japanese diets, on average, contain about 10 times more soy than North
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American diets, and the Japanese have a lower incidence of cancer and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart disease. This study shows that the nutrient genistein may play a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part by helping to regulate cell communication.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center, 1999
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soy sterols lower cholesterol even more than low-fat diet.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;ARS Sugarbeet and Bean Research Unit, 1999
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bean coats contain the same anti-oxidants credited with cancer- and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart-disease fighting properties of red wine, fruits, and vegetables.
