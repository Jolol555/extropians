<p>Yes: the first batch of retirees who got money from the system without having

(or taken out of the labor pool) in the Depression.

<p>I have seen claims that the eldest segment of the population has gone from
<br>
being among the poorest as a whole to being the richest.  I think I may have
<br>
been this from anti-SS people.  Note this would include the admission that
<br>
most people after a lifetime of work were still pretty poor.

<p>You find your first assumption unlikely because it would discourage saving and
<br>
investment?  Isn't that like believing in God because the alternative is
<br>
emotionally unappealing?
<br>
<p>One thing about SS is that while the yield might be less, it's more secure.
<br>
Society has developed a certain unwillingness to see starving old people, even
<br>
if they 'earned it' through bad luck in the stock market.
<br>
<p>Paul Krugman occasionally has interesting things to say about the total amount
<br>
of savings in the economy.  I'll try to come with something on the spot.
<br>
<p>Say there's S money going into SS, which might otherwise go into the stocks
<br>
and bonds markets.  The money either turns around going out to someone else,
<br>
or else gets parked in US bonds.  Which reduces the amount of money the US
<br>
gov't must borrow from outside, thus reducing the interest rate on the debt,
<br>
which after all has to be paid by the taxpayers.  So there's less explicit
<br>
yield on the SS money, but it's lowering taxes as well.  Perhaps these effects
<br>
cancel out?  And if all the SS money were going into the stock market, but the
<br>
gov't still needed to borrow X money, it'd raise interest rates to attract the
<br>
money.  Raising taxes, as I said, but also leading to the conclusion that the
<br>
total amounts invested in stocks and bonds respectively may be the same with
<br>
or without SS (the same in each scenario, not the same as each other.)
