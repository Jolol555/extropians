True, North Korea seems to be even worse.  OTOH, Cuba isn't -- it's

repressive, but I have't heard claims of murder.  And in 1950 we couldn't know

how bad North Korea would turn out to be.  So we accepted mass murder by our

we treat Cuba.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More broadly, the 31-page document asserts American dominance as the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lone superpower - a status no rival power will be allowed to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;challenge.          
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it provides a reason the world should accept this state of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affairs: the expansion of peace and more freedom. A Pax Americana will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be &quot;in the service of a balance of power that favors freedom.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics are already describing the new strategy as arrogant and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dangerous - a far cry from the tone of humility in foreign affairs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promised in President Bush's inaugural address.
<br>
<p>In the service of the war on drugs, and pressure against abortion or cloning

rights?

It's not liberal paranoia, it's the National Security Strategy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fall of the Soviet Union. Perhaps you would disagree, but I would then ask 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you provide some examples in which Communist regimes willingly gave up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power prior to the fall of the USSR.
</em><br>
<p>Technically East Germany, in 1989, although that took USSR forbearance; the
<br>
USSR proper didn't fall until 1991.
<br>
<p>And, you know, the Soviet Bloc did fall.  We contained it, but we didn't push
<br>
it over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; United States. The decision by our government to support the tyrannical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pinochet regime can and should be rigorously debated. However, it should be 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the coup President Allende was found dead inside the           
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presidential palace. Whether he was killed or whether he killed    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, we'll never know. In the regime of terror that ensued,       
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousands of people were killed. Many more simply 'disappeared'.      
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firing squads conducted public executions. Concentration camps and  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;torture chambers were opened across the country. The dead were buried 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in mine shafts and unmarked graves. For 17 years the people of Chile
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lived in dread of the midnight knock, of routine 'disappearances', of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudden arrest and torture. Chileans tell the story of how the musician
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victor Jara had his hands cut off in front of a crowd in the Santiago
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stadium. Before they shot him, Pinochet's soldiers threw his guitar at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him and mockingly ordered him to play.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, following the arrest of General Pinochet in Britain,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousands of secret documents were declassified by the US government.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They contain unequivocal evidence of the CIA's involvement in the coup
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as the fact that the US government had detailed information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the situation in Chile during General Pinochet's reign. Yet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kissinger assured the general of his support: 'In the United States as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you know, we are sympathetic to what you are trying to do', he said,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We wish your government well'.
<br>
&nbsp;-- Arundhati Roy in the Guardian
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will certainly strenuously argue with your contention if need be, but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would first ask if you seriously believe that the Mullahs are in anyway 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vulnerable to losing their 24 year grip on power through this &quot;democracy&quot; you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest is present in Iran.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I do.  I follow news in Iran somewhat regularly.  Reformists have been
<br>
elected -- in fact, dominate the legislature.  Students protest.  People are
<br>
tired of theocracy and poor economy, and have some room for saying so.  And if
<br>
you're a woman you're much better off there than in Saudia Arabia or
<br>
Afghanistan.  Dress code, yes, but also the ability to pursue politics and
<br>
professions.
