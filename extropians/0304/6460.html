<p>I don't know if the President's decisions were 'right and proper'. I
<br>
don't even know if such terms have any rigorous definition when applied
<br>
to geopolitical events. I don't know what the President knows. But, very
<br>
few people would argue that threats to their lives and well-being should
<br>
be allowed to multiply. The 'hawks' have a more inclusive view of these
<br>
threats than the 'doves'. A national security strategy that includes
<br>
pre-emption as a justification for intervention can be said to be
<br>
'hawkish' in this sense as it broadens the definition of threat to
<br>
include threats that have not yet materialized. Some people don't buy
<br>
that a possible future threat is a threat now. Some people do. And some
<br>
are in the middle. Regardless of where you or I stand, this broadening
<br>
and narrowing of definitions for the sake of the outcome, or for a
<br>
political end, is a lawyer's game. For some people to believe X is a
<br>
threat, there must be hard evidence, and theory is not enough. For some
<br>
people to believe that X may be a threat in the future, less evidence is
<br>
required, and a good theory may be enough. The doctrine of pre-emption
<br>
offers soothsaying as a way to bridge the gap between the available
<br>
evidence and the desired outcome.
<br>
<p>(Summing-up amidst charges of being academic...) It will eventually fall
<br>
to academics (which I am not) to review the theories propounded as
<br>
rationales for pre-emption.
