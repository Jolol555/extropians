</em><br>
<p>My argument is pretty much entirely aesthetic. But that doesn't
<br>
necessarily make it &quot;personal preference&quot;, either. I have a feeling that
<br>
aesthetic principles tend to be quite similar across large numbers of
<br>
human beings. Lots of people obviously have the ability to appreciate
<br>
animals - one look at our culture tells us that. Many people just
<br>
arbitrarily stop caring about animals when it interferes with an activity
<br>
(eating meat) that is a nearly universal meme in the society and
<br>
considered impossible to break (and the connection between
<br>
store-packaged meats and real-live animals is heavily suppressed in the
<br>
minds of many people).
<br>
<p>The &quot;anthropomorphizing&quot; critique is flawed because nonhuman animals *do*
<br>
have many characteristics in common with humans, not surprising given our
<br>
common evolutionary history. But again, many people deny evolution, and
<br>
many people also deny that humans are a type of animal.
<br>
<p>It's not *too* mysterious to guess that getting shot or throat-slit is not
<br>
in the top 10 of a deer or cow's daily activities, it seems to me the
<br>
burden of proof is on those who argue that animals are just robots that
<br>
don't feel pain or care about what happens to themselves. 
<br>
<p>The food chain, the chain of living things, is a continuous spectrum of
<br>
sentience and intelligence, from humans fading down into things like
<br>
nematodes and algae, which are so little sentient or intelligent that most
<br>
people do not use those terms to describe them. It's a judgment call where
<br>
you stop eating - whether you eat humans and everything else, or whether
<br>
you eat only nonhuman animals, or just chicken not beef, or fish and not
<br>
chicken, or insects but not fish. It ought to be a judgment at least
<br>
partially based on what you know, or can reasonably infer, about the food
<br>
source's value to you and the aesthetic consequences of eating it. Is one
<br>
grasshopper different enough from another that eating it removes a unique
<br>
and precious source of value in the world? Does it feel enough that
<br>
killing it and eating it would bring enough trauma into the world to
<br>
disturb your sense of your own self-efficacy? I tend to think the more
<br>
value we can keep in the world, the better, and the less
<br>
suffering and destruction we can cause, the better. But there are often
<br>
other considerations...
