<br>
you are recommending that the minimum wage be lowered or removed.  
<br>
Effectively, it already has been.  People can't avoid paying taxes, so they 
<br>
would actually end up in the hole for paying their rent at the end of a 
<br>
month, even with no other expenses at all.  (e.g., food, clothes, medicine.)
<br>
<p>Charles,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an old joke that goes, &quot;I was born in the night, but it 
<br>
wasn't last night.&quot;  Well, you and I have disagreed in the past many times 
<br>
but it wasn't this time.&quot; &lt;G&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating trying to take a raise that was received in the 
<br>
past away from people.  I am saying that proposals to wage the minimum wage 
<br>
in my experience in manufacturing are so cynical as to be unconscionable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what I see happening:
<br>
1.  The new wage is passed, the politician gets good press for his 
<br>
humanitarian impulses.  Anyone against the increase gets castigated in the 
<br>
press.  Actually this phase is totally a win-win from a strictly political 
<br>
point of view.  The one side gets kudos for being humanitarian, the other 
<br>
side gets kudos from its supporters for standing up for the right.
<br>
2.  The business owners tells their supervisors, etc., to cut out enough 
<br>
labor to pay for the raise.  They do so and as these things are done by 
<br>
seniority the ones that lose their jobs are the ones at the bottom that were 
<br>
supposed to get the raises -- they don't, they get unemployed.
<br>
3.  The unions that supported the increase in the minimum wages wait until 
<br>
the next bargaining round and point to the new minimum wage as justification 
<br>
for an increase.  After all skilled labor has to maintain its differential 
<br>
with the minimum wage and unskilled labor.  They like the increase because 
<br>
they win also.
<br>
4.  Finally an up tick in the business cycle comes along so a few people are 
<br>
hired at the new minimum wage.  However in my mind it is questionable that 
<br>
they win either.  My best guess is that the new labor is more highly 
<br>
qualified than the labor that was released because of the earlier raise.
<br>
