<p>
Harvey and Lee raise some very interesting points vis-a-vis whether
<br>
teleportation has to use the same atoms.
<br>
<p>I think Harvey may have said:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think this is true.  I am not sure I know of anyone who objects to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teleported in this manner.
</em><br>
<p>And I think this was assuming the atoms didn't matter -- it was
<br>
the organizational pattern of the atoms that was important.
<br>
<p>I think Lee then said:
<br>
<em>&gt; I was astonished early last year to learn that some highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent and thoughtful list members will not teleport.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, on my &quot;Seven Levels of Identity&quot;, they are at level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one or two.
</em><br>
<p>My conclusion is that Harvey &amp; Lee know diffferent sets of people.
<br>
<p>Lee then added a *very* useful hierarchy -- that should get written
<br>
up so we don't have to rehash these topics every year or so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (The seven levels are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Will travel by space warp, but won't permit disassembly of atoms.
</em><br>
<p>Space warp is &quot;magic physics&quot; at this point in time so I think we can
<br>
set it aside until Amara, Anders or GTS come up with some more &quot;wierd&quot;
<br>
papers out of the LANL preprint archive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  Will permit teleportation, but only if the same atoms are used.
</em><br>
<p>Very hard (bordering on highly improbable) -- you have to turn matter
<br>
into energy, transmit it across a distance then convert it back into
<br>
matter.  If possible it seems likely to be *very* expensive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.  Will teleport, unless there is a delay.
</em><br>
<p>Can't get around the delay unless you intend to violate speed-of-light
<br>
constraints.  (So seems to lead back to the &quot;magic physics&quot; realm.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  Will teleport, but finds backups to be useless.
</em><br>
<p>That is plain stupid and equivalent to signing ones own death
<br>
certificate -- I asserted this at Extro3 -- one needs distributed
<br>
replicated intelligence to survive the natural (or even engineered)
<br>
hazard function.
<br>
<p>Now how one connects, utilizes, activates, etc. the &quot;distributed&quot;
<br>
intelligence remain open questions (and one people may have personal
<br>
preferences about).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5.  Finds backups acceptable, provided that they've had no run time.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, this seems reasonable assuming some type of upload or teleportation
<br>
(atomic pattern copying) technology becomes feasible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6.  Anticipates future experiences of duplicates, but only one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     particular.
</em><br>
<p>It seems hard to &quot;anticipate&quot; future experiences.  It seems to suggest
<br>
that one can predict the future and that seems unlikely.  I think this
<br>
point needs reframing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7.  Logically, but not necessarily emotionally, anticipates all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     experiences of all duplicates past or future, near or far.
</em><br>
<p>One obviously (if one adheres to speed-of-light limits) has a problem
<br>
with the availability of data to &quot;reintegrate&quot; the experiences of
<br>
duplicates in &quot;real-time&quot;.
<br>
<p>I think one problem with these levels is that they seem to presume
<br>
the retention of the current concept of an &quot;individual&quot;.  In a
<br>
Jupiter Brain or a Matrioshka Brain one's &quot;individuality&quot; may become
<br>
so interconnected with the &quot;collective&quot; that it becomes relatively
<br>
difficult or impossible to teleport an individual at all.
<br>
<p>How many people on the list would deny themselves the opportunity
<br>
to have &quot;instant&quot; access to the knowledge base of the other list
<br>
members?  Hell -- I'd seriously consider standing in the line
<br>
to have my arm broken ten times to get high bandwidth access
<br>
to many list members knowledge bases.  Once we open up that door
<br>
our current concepts of &quot;individual&quot; are going to become somewhat
<br>
&quot;fuzzy&quot; (IMO).
<br>
<p>Lee continues:
<br>
<em>&gt; I claim that this decision rests with owner of the resources,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps just the owner of the atoms involved.  For example, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone came to me and wanted to be teleported to New York, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insisted that he would permit me to gratify his wish only if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also arranged for the destruction of the original, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reluctantly agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it *is* a dumb waste, isn't it?
</em><br>
<p>No, not if its Lee -- one copy is *completely* sufficient.
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The core problem is that most people do not realize that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are both the original and the copy, in a peculiar way that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidently we haven't been prepared by evolution to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitively.  Duplicates are self.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  This is the heart of the problem.  We just don't have a
<br>
frame of reference for dealing with copies of ourselves.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Damien could provide a summary of the SciFi literature
<br>
that has attempted to deal with this in some way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (The fool probably is afraid that the original is going to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home and sleep with his wife.  What is the emoticon for utter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exasperation?)
</em><br>
<p>Oh, with &quot;copies&quot; you are into much more complex problems than
<br>
that -- who has the right/obligation to go to ones job in the
<br>
morning, who is contractually obligated to make the mortgage
<br>
payments, etc. etc.  It is a *REAL* mess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, although I suspect that a totally consistent value system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be compatible with the result that an intricate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather marvelous assemblage of atoms (such as the original)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be destroyed without a good reason.
</em><br>
<p>Not clear Lee -- the problem is that &quot;assembling&quot; (or disassembling)
<br>
atoms is now difficult.  But my read of what it seems like robust
<br>
nanotech enables is that it need not be that way (there are limits
<br>
but it seems like they involve ability to deliver energy and remove
<br>
heat).  But the probable rates would make most individuals eyes
<br>
pop out of their heads.  So the &quot;value&quot; of an individual (as
<br>
a physical entity) becomes much lower.  It is the information
<br>
content (as a description of a pattern of atoms) that is valuable.
<br>
<p>It is a very different world and I don't think most people are
<br>
anywhere near ready to deal with it (emotionally).
<br>
