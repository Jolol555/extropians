<p>
LC&gt;&gt; between the American people and its government, you then totally
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ignore that very distinction by implying that we are somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; attacking the world's people instead of their governments.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
DS&gt; But do the people under the governments we attack make that distinction?
<br>
<p>That's a good question; if they do, then the cost of pissing them off
<br>
may well outweigh the benefits to be achieved by the war, and that's
<br>
a valid argument worth pursuing.  But we can be clear and honest that
<br>
we are talking about the perceptions of the people whose government we
<br>
are attacking while still not buying into that perception ourselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; or imply that that we are attacking the people under them is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dishonest and detracts from reasoned discourse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, governments don't get killed, people get killed.  That's one thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll consider.  And if they feel some ownership of their government, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loathe the idea of American invasion even more, they'll feel attacked.
</em><br>
<p>Governments do get replaced, and yes, sometimes that requires killing
<br>
the people who created and supported that government.  And some of those
<br>
people, like conscripted soldiers, were unwilling participants, that's
<br>
true.  But we still have to be clear that we are making the distinction,
<br>
and the distinction does exist.
<br>
<p>I'll even concede that benefiting the people of Iraq is probably not
<br>
our major motivation for removing its government.  After all, there are
<br>
other despots--even such monsters as Pol Pot, who made Hussein look like
<br>
a boy scout--who we did not choose to remove.  But even with all that
<br>
conceded, it is still a dishonest rhetorical trick to say that we are
<br>
in fact attacking the people of Iraq, when we are doing no such thing.
