MaxPlumm Said:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; All of these accusations are to some degrees true. However, I do not see
</em><br>
any perspective given to &gt;&gt; any of these judgments you have passed. For
<br>
instance, the United States &quot;propped up&quot; the regime of &gt;&gt; Syngman Rhee in
<br>
South Korea in 1950. Rhee was certainly an authoritarian and a thug.
<br>
<p>To which Damien sullivan responded:
<br>
<em>&gt; And in 1950 we couldn't know how bad North Korea would turn out to be.  So
</em><br>
we accepted mass murder
<br>
<em>&gt; by our ally
</em><br>
<p>You miss the point entirely.  1st off, at no point in history do we know
<br>
exactly how the future would turn out, however, everyone was pretty
<br>
confident that communism sucked and democratic capitalism did not.  Whether
<br>
history would prove them to be true was yet unknown, but it did in fact
<br>
prove them so.  Considering more than 30 million chinese died in the
<br>
cultural revolutions there, the fewer cultural revolutions the better. 2nd,
<br>
as Max is trying to emphasize, it was not a choice between mass murder of
<br>
2,000 people and NO mass murder, it was a choice between mass murder of
<br>
2,000 people and mass murder of 2 MILLION people.   To criticize the US for
<br>
supporting a thug but not appluaud it at preventing the enslavement and
<br>
murder of millions of people is rediculous.
<br>
<p>I invite you to read Christopher Hitchens description of North Korea.
<br>
<p>Liberal Author Christopher Hitchens calls North Korea 'The Worst of the
<br>
Worst', it is the worst possible combination of absolute despotism,
<br>
totalitarianism, and state failure. It is a living example of the nightmare
<br>
portrayed in Orwells 1984 and predicted result of runaway nationalization in
<br>
Rand's Atlas Shrugged, he says of North Korea -
<br>
<p>&quot;All films, all books, all newspapers and all radio and television
<br>
broadcasts are about either the Father or the Son[Kim Jong Il]. Everybody is
<br>
a soldier. Everybody is an informer. Everybody is a unit. Everything is
<br>
propaganda...Children are drilled to think of Japanese and Americans, in
<br>
particular, as monstrous...The old justification for the Stalinist
<br>
forced-march system was that at least it led to development. But even in
<br>
Pyongyang, the capital city which is reserved for approved citizens, one can
<br>
see that this excuse doesn't work. Neither does anything else; the place is
<br>
stalled and hungry and subject to constant blackouts. There are no cars on
<br>
the streets; there is no construction except of tawdry shrines to the Holy
<br>
Family. A very small window of dollar bribery has opened up in recent years,
<br>
but there's nothing to buy and no black market. Corruption at the leadership
<br>
level is exorbitant, with palaces and limos and (a special obsession of Kim
<br>
Jong Il's) megalomaniacal movie projects...I saw people scavenging
<br>
individual grains from the fields and washing themselves in open sewers. On
<br>
the almost deserted roads, animals do a good deal of the hauling. Domestic
<br>
pets are nowhere to be seen. Perhaps most have been eaten, for the fact is
<br>
that North Korea is a famine stat...Nobody knows the death toll-the best
<br>
guess is between 1.5 and 2 million-but in addition a generation of
<br>
physically and mentally stunted children has been &quot;fathered&quot; by the &quot;Dear
<br>
Leader.&quot; Well-attested rumors of cannibalism have filtered across the border
<br>
to China, where a Korean-speaking minority has lately been augmented by
<br>
refugees so desperate that they will risk shooting in order to brave the
<br>
river. A system where you can't live but you can't leave is the definition
<br>
of hell...deserted towns, empty factories, wandering and neglected children
<br>
and untilled fields...the country's once productive coal mines have been
<br>
allowed to flood, and that there are no pumps that can be brought to bear&quot;
<br>
(from -<a href="http://www.chosunjournal.com/worst.html">http://www.chosunjournal.com/worst.html</a>)
<br>
<p>The latest estimates are that the state has killed 2 million people in the
<br>
recent famine. This would make it the worst state killing since Cambodia in
<br>
the 1970s. It would push the total killing by the communist regime since its
<br>
origin to about 4 million people, making communist North Korea the 6th
<br>
greatest killer since 1900.
<br>
<p>Now compare North Korea with South Korea, which started with similiar
<br>
populations nearly identical climates, land area, people, and culture. Yet
<br>
South Korea, which embraced capitalism and democracy at the end of the
<br>
Korean War is now the 11th largest economy in the world, a bustling hub of
<br>
progress and growth which recently hosted the Olympics. North Korea, on the
<br>
other hand, embraced massive statism, it is the only full fledged communist
<br>
state intact, its people are desperately poor and millions have starved to
<br>
death, while factories and fields remain unused and empty it receives
<br>
billions in international aide while maintaining a standing army of 1
<br>
million with artillary constantly aimed at South Korea's capital. A truly
<br>
sad state of affiars.
<br>
<p>If the United States had not supported a 'totalarian thug' which murdered
<br>
2000 of his own people, All the people of South Korea, which numbers 48
<br>
million today, would be living under the same horrific hellish conditions,
<br>
where every year is 1984, that the people of North Korea live under.
