<p>Agreed, though the Eskimo environment is certainly a special case. If
<br>
Eskimos could reach beneath the ice to eat sea plants then they would
<br>
certainly do so. 
<br>
<p>The high percentage of animal calories in the Eskimo diet is actually strong
<br>
evidence that humans are well adapted to paleolithic diets rich in animal
<br>
fats and animal proteins. I recall reading about two anglo scientists who
<br>
lived with the Eskimos (or with some other people near the northern polar
<br>
cap) for more than a year. They subsisted entirely on meat. Surprisingly,
<br>
they were in perfect health upon their return home. One might think they
<br>
would have at least shown evidence of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), but
<br>
such was not the case.
