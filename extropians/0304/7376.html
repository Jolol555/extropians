<p><em>&gt; What is amazing here is that we all seem to agree on the problem,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though how to solve it leads inevitably to contentious debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can go to the mountaintop, as it were, making of himself a Stalin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for a while) and ponder the remaking the world in a better image. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything will be fine and dandy (after the initial 100 days of terror, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course). One can think in realpolitic and ignore the individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality on the ground (as in, for example, dead Iraqi children).
</em><br>
<p>Am I to suppose that that was just an accidental example?
<br>
<p>That is: that the probability was 1/2 the example might
<br>
have instead turned out to be &quot;tortured and dead Iraqi
<br>
political prisoners over the last decade&quot;?  ;-)
<br>
<p>Yes, the words &quot;remaking the world&quot; should indeed inspire
<br>
caution, if not extreme skepticism.  If we learned anything
<br>
in the 20th century, it was that societies, economies, and
<br>
nations are too complex at this time for humans to &quot;remake&quot;.
<br>
(I really used to shiver when Hillary spoke about remolding
<br>
society; I could infer that the idea was for her to be the
<br>
&quot;re-molder&quot;, and I would be one of the &quot;re-moldees&quot;!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can ignore libertarian and extropian approbations against violent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercion, or Founding Fathers' disdain of foreign entanglement; after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, those Founders didn't face nano or bio driven world-Armageddon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios. Morality must take a back seat to reality, eh?
</em><br>
<p>What is the role of such principles (and memes) in our thinking?
<br>
When do we verge on hyper-rationality by sticking to principle?
<br>
If some genius has a black and white answer to these questions, I
<br>
will be the first to embrace him as the philosopher of our age.
<br>
(Anders---you want to give it a try!?   ;-)
<br>
<p>So far as I know, dismissals like &quot;morality must take a back
<br>
seat to reality&quot;, or &quot;compromised principles are not principles&quot;
<br>
are both too far from reality (to echo the inspired poetry of
<br>
our departed, but beloved, Iraqi Minister of Information).
<br>
<p>But let's take the libertarian prescription advocating that
<br>
one never be the first to initiate force.  I think that most
<br>
people on this list have a fairly good idea of what is meant;
<br>
it's an ideal.  It supplies, among other things, the idea
<br>
that taxation is theft.  But few libertarians, to my knowledge
<br>
embrace an anarchism so profound that they won't support any
<br>
taxation at all.  Nonetheless, the principle serves to moderate
<br>
our thoughts about when taxation is appropriate.  You might say
<br>
that it &quot;biases&quot; the discussion in the way that electronic
<br>
components can be electrically biased.
<br>
<p>Now then.  We round up the most committed libertarians we
<br>
can find, and put them in the usual Martian colony, where
<br>
they prosper freely engaging in trade with each other and
<br>
so forth.  Finally one is born who has a psychotic streak
<br>
and who tries to beat up and kill people from time to 
<br>
time.  Each time he does so, he's punished.  But now he's
<br>
in his hut making a sharp and deadly spear.  What to do?
<br>
Could this band of libertarians rouse themselves for a
<br>
pre-emptive strike?  It seems to me that they should hesitate
<br>
(though not twelve years), and then go ahead.  It had to be
<br>
clear in their minds what was at stake, so to speak.
<br>
<p>So if a couple of the roused libertarians go into that
<br>
guy's hut, break the proto-spear, shove it you-know-where,
<br>
and then really kick the crap out of him, how much does
<br>
their world change?  What kind of precedent has been
<br>
established?  What was the alternative?
<br>
<p>How ever you answer these questions you'll answer our larger
<br>
ones.
<br>
<p>Lee
