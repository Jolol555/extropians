<em>&gt; SMART HEURISTICS: GERD GIGERENZER [3.31.03]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What interests me is the question of how humans learn to live with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty. Before the scientific revolution determinism was a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal. Religion brought about a denial of uncertainty, and many people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their kin or their race was exactly the one that God had favored. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also thought they were entitled to get rid of competing ideas and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that propagated them. How does a society change from this condition into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which we understand that there is this fundamental uncertainty? How do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid the illusion of certainty to produce the understanding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything, whether it be a medical test or deciding on the best cure for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular kind of cancer, has a fundamental element of uncertainty?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Introduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Isn¹t more information always better?&quot; asks Gerd Gigerenzer. &quot;Why else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would bestsellers on how to make good decisions tell us to consider all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces of information, weigh them carefully, and compute the optimal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferably with the aid of a fancy statistical software package? In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics, Nobel prizes are regularly awarded for work that assumes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people make decisions as if they had perfect information and could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the optimal solution for the problem at hand. But how do real people make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good decisions under the usual conditions of little time and scarce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information? Consider how players catch a ball‹in baseball, cricket, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soccer. It may seem that they would have to solve complex differential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equations in their heads to predict the trajectory of the ball. In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players use a simple heuristic. When a ball comes in high, the player
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixates the ball and starts running. The heuristic is to adjust the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed so that the angle of gaze remains constant ‹that is, the angle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the eye and the ball. The player can ignore all the information necessary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compute the trajectory, such as the ball¹s initial velocity, distance, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angle, and just focus on one piece of information, the angle of gaze.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gigerenzer provides an alternative to the view of the mind as a cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimizer, and also to its mirror image, the mind as a cognitive miser. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that people ignore information has been often mistaken as a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrationality,and shelves are filled with books that explain how people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routinely commit cognitive fallacies. In seven years of research, he, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his research team at Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, have worked out what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes is a viable alternative: the study of fast and frugal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision-making, that is, the study of smart heuristics people actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make good decisions. In order to make good decisions in an uncertain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, one sometimes has to ignore information. The art is knowing what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn¹t have to know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gigerenzer's work is of importance to people interested in how the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind actually solves problems. In this regard his work is influential to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychologists, economists, philosophers, and animal biologists, among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others. It is also of interest to people who design smart systems to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems; he provides illustrations on how one can construct fast and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frugal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategies for coronary care unit decisions, personnel selection, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;My work will, I hope, change the way people think about human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says. &quot;Human rationality cannot be understood, I argue, by the ideals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omniscience and optimization. In an uncertain world, there is no optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution known for most interesting and urgent problems. When human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fails to meet these Olympian expectations, many psychologists conclude 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mind is doomed to irrationality. These are the two dominant views 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and neither extreme of hyper-rationality or irrationality captures the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essence of human reasoning. My aim is not so much to criticize the status
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quo, but rather to provide a viable alternative.&quot;
