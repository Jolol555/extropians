<em>&gt; &gt; the short, intermediate and long terms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the short term one has to do what is already being done.  Wear masks
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>To expand on these personal strategies if you are in an effected region:
<br>
<p>1.  Most important is to wash hands obsessively, especially before and
<br>
after using restrooms.  Use disposable towels to dry hands, and use them
<br>
to open door leaving.  Consider bringing antiseptic handywipes for
<br>
occasions when handwashing is not available.
<br>
<p>2.  Avoid touching face, mouth, eyes, etc.  especially after shaking
<br>
hands, using doors, touching public surfaces.  Avoid shaking hands, but it
<br>
is probably not worth offending anyone to do so.  A little extra personal
<br>
space, again if it won't offend anyone, won't hurt. 
<br>
<p>3.  A mask, rated N95, might be worth wearing in confined areas such as
<br>
aircraft.  N95 masks are readily available at hardware and drug stores for
<br>
as little as $1 each.
<br>
<p>4. Avoid crowds such as theatres, restaurants, public transportation.
<br>
Taxis and room service, but again probably not worth it if it interferes
<br>
with your business.
<br>
<p>5.  If you must visit a severely effected area, such as a hospital, wear
<br>
mask, gloves, follow the rules carefully.  Do not violate any quarantines.
<br>
<p>6.  If anything other than supportive care (such as antivirals) starts
<br>
looking successful, and business takes to to an effected area without good
<br>
medical care (rural China as opposed to Toronto), consider meeting with
<br>
your physician to put together a travel kit of medications.  Many people
<br>
do this now when visiting impoverished areas, bringing their own sterile
<br>
needles and such since local standards of medical hygiene can leave
<br>
something to be desired.
<br>
<p>7.  Don't panic.  Chances of you visiting an effected area and catching
<br>
SARS are still pretty low...but this may be subject to change.
<br>
<p>8.  I am not a doctor, this isn't medical advise, etc.  Just my own take
<br>
on the situation.
