</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, good.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; However such statements are not themselves part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of any valid logical argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I couldn't disagree with you more. Saying they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scum is PART of a valid logical argument, it is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.
</em><br>
<p>If the object of your argument is to judge the moral
<br>
character of other people, (to &quot;play God&quot; as some
<br>
might say), then sure, it can be a &quot;conclusion&quot; of
<br>
sorts. 
<br>
<p>You might argue with a Nazi:
<br>
<p>1) Moral people believe and act according to maxims a,
<br>
b, and c.
<br>
<p>2) Those like you who believe and act according to
<br>
Nazism do not act according to maxims a, b and c.
<br>
<p>3) Therefore those who like you who believe and act
<br>
according to Nazism are not moral and may be defined
<br>
as &quot;scum.&quot;
<br>
<p>This argument does nothing however to actually prove
<br>
the critical assumptions inherent in 1) or 2). 
<br>
<p>Valid logical arguments must have both 1) logical
<br>
consistency and 2) valid premises. 
<br>
<p>The loyal Nazi would disagree with your assumption in
<br>
1) and perhaps also in 2). He would object to your
<br>
argument, stating that it is logical but not valid;
<br>
that you had failed to first prove your premises. And
<br>
he would be correct, logically speaking.
<br>
<p>As I understand it, you were lambasted by your fellow
<br>
extropes at one time for calling another extropian a
<br>
&quot;blithering idiot.&quot; If that is so, then it was because
<br>
your assumptions were not widely accepted here as
<br>
true, and/or because your statement was perceived as
<br>
just downright *rude*. 
<br>
<p>It is quite possible to be perfectly logical and also
<br>
perfectly rude. Such things happen occasionally (none
<br>
of us are perfectly rational, non-emotional beings)
<br>
and when they do an apology is usually in order. 
<br>
<p>There is nothing rational about violating the rules of
<br>
social etiquette, and one might argue that intentional
<br>
violations of those rules are in fact irrational, in
<br>
that they usually back-fire if one's intention is to
<br>
convince others of the validity of one's views.
<br>
Rudeness generally does not earn anyone brownie points
<br>
in the credibility category.
<br>
<p>It's true that 2+2 does not equal 5, but calling those
<br>
who believe otherwise &quot;blithering idiots&quot; is not going
<br>
to help the math professor interested in furthering
<br>
his career.
