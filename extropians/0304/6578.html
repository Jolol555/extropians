<p><em>&gt; In any case, focus on the notion of evolution having two

<p>I'm not convinced that either of these mechanisms are fundamental. Maybe you
<br>
should define them better so that I might understand your POV. 
<br>
<p>As I see it, regardless of what we might want to happen in our minds in or
<br>
out of the local singles bar, in the long run the only real natural
<br>
selection process is for procreation -- not survival. Those gene lineages
<br>
most likely to find willing mates would be most likely to pass their genes
<br>
to future generations. 
<br>
<p>With respect to traits like intelligence as measured by IQ, I'm thinking
<br>
that in the final analysis it makes little difference whether mate-selection
<br>
is male or female driven. Both sexes should want only that their offspring
<br>
to be &quot;intelligent&quot; enough to create and rear more offspring. I bracketed
<br>
intelligence in the previous sentence because intelligence in these terms
<br>
might have nothing to do with IQ scores. Promiscuous and sexy people who
<br>
know intuitively how to strut their stuff to attract a sexual mate would be
<br>
very &quot;intelligent&quot; in evolutionary terms, even if they were never capable of
<br>
graduating high school.
