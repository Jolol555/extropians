At 09:00 PM 4/5/03 -0500, Harvey was excited by an RJB post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You are also in the running to get the prize for creating the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worthwhile stuff to talk about!  (I forgot to ask what the prize was.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hope it is a pre-paid teleportation ticket of the kind you are describing.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Read further to see where you have triggered me to clarify my position
</em><br>
<em>&gt;versus destructive copies.  Your version of the process may resolve my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;objections!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; First,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; What happens to one copy may not happen to the other copy.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Oh but you can't assume this.  If I can make 1000 copies of RJB
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think I might be quite tempted to produce a collective mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (it is essential to beat the hazard function -- repeat after me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;distributed replicated intelligence&quot;).  The logical step beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that is a highly interconnected &quot;distributed replicated intelligence&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Once one can do this all of the information and experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; become &quot;shared&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Wow.  This is an intermediate copy/transfer scenario.  If the two brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could really work in conjunction to control both bodies with one mind, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would raise some new possibilities. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but not exactly *new*. Let's see. &lt; dragging up file of THE SPIKE &gt;:
<br>
<p>=========
<br>
<p>Can we find some case where duplication has no distressing consequences?
<br>
Suppose all twins were born perfectly telepathic, so that each experienced
<br>
what the other did. If one of the two died, would that really matter? You
<br>
might grieve today if one of your arms were amputated, but you wouldn't
<br>
think that you'd thereby lost one of your selves... That analogy doesn't
<br>
quite work, because even telepathic twins are differently situated as
<br>
visible persons in space, and the loss of one body would surely devastate
<br>
the other locus of their shared consciousness. Still, it undermines simple
<br>
views about identity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what if everyone were given a cloned double, with whose brain-states
<br>
he or she slowly became redundantly resonant... Sorry, it doesn't work.
<br>
It's hard to retain empathy for the subjects of these thought games. Vernor
<br>
Vinge, who's spent a great deal of time on these problems of the Spike,
<br>
went some way toward exploring the experience of a shifting group-mind in
<br>
his novel A Fire Upon the Deep. In such a disseminated consciousness, made
<br>
up of wolf-like individuals, some modules can die and get replaced by
<br>
different individuals entirely. The character of the ensemble would alter,
<br>
but a core of identity of the group-mind/bodies might prevail. Or so Vinge
<br>
claims.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line, I conclude, is that physical and general brain-process
<br>
continuity support our current sense of continuing identity. They allow us
<br>
to believe that the person who wakes up tomorrow is the same one who went
<br>
to sleep tonight. What of awakening after ten years in a coma? Nobody
<br>
denies that this case is deeply traumatic, but still we assume that the
<br>
same person has woken up. Waking after half the brain is removed to
<br>
forestall death by cancer? No one denies that this case is even more deeply
<br>
troubling. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look-- Even if I can't tell the difference between you and your
<br>
perfect clone, you surely can, as they strip your brain down. 
<br>
<p>================
<br>
<p>This last point was also made amusingly in Harvey's fine, caustic post
<br>
about the `duplicate' on Mars.
