<p>
This factoid comes from <a href="http://www.lactose.co.uk/intolerance/">http://www.lactose.co.uk/intolerance/</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Around 95% of Asians have lactose intolerance. 75% of Blacks and 50% of
<br>
Mediterranean people also have lactose intolerance.&quot; 
<br>
<p>If these stats are correct then the majority of the homo sapiens are not
<br>
adapted to dairy. This suggests very strongly that even those of us who show
<br>
no symptoms are not yet fully adapted.
<br>
<p>Personally I enjoy the taste of dairy products, and like the majority of
<br>
Caucasians of European descent my body shows no obvious symptoms that I am
<br>
not adapted to them. I am not lactose intolerant, per se. However I do not
<br>
believe that my body actually expects dairy as part of my diet. 
<br>
<p>If my genes could speak, I would guess that if I were to add dairy products
<br>
back to my diet they would say something like this: &quot;Damn! There he goes
<br>
again! We have an emergency change of plans! Ramp up the production of
<br>
lactase! Send some extra help to the gastrointestinal tract for the
<br>
digestion of casein! It's time once again to devote energy and resources to
<br>
things we really ought not be doing!&quot; 
<br>
<p>The situation is of course much worse for people with clinical lactose
<br>
intolerance. In their case the genes are incapable of handling the stress
<br>
from this non-paleolithic food. Milk-sugar (lactose) does not get broken
<br>
down into simpler sugars, causing gastrointestinal distress, and/or milk
<br>
protein (casein) is not digested which also causes gastrointestinal
<br>
distress. In some cases there is an allergic reaction.
