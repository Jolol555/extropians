In a message dated 4/30/2003 12:08:10 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Coming%20World%20Police%20System">samantha@objectent.com</a> quotes apparently Phil Osborn: The reason for the new 
<br>
system is pretty much as they have stated it, but a little more radical.  
<br>
Basically, they accept Conrad Schnieker's hypothesis about the exponentially 
<br>
rising curve of cheap weapons of annihilation - binary viruses, etc., which 
<br>
Conrad, one of the originators of &quot;nanotechnology&quot; as a focused movement and 
<br>
theory, stated in the late '70's. 
<br>
<p>Phil seems to express the underlying thought convictions of some people on 
<br>
this list.  I wonder if this approach including transparency will pass the 
<br>
test of Occams razor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9-11 the guys used box cutters.  I am told that an ingenuous person 
<br>
could find weapons even today -- but one major factor has changed.  Before 
<br>
9-11 the smart people knew the way to handle a hijacker was to surrender, let 
<br>
him fly you to Cuba and enjoy the ride.  Now we know that isn't true and we 
<br>
have an entirely different paradigm.  I seriously doubt if three or four guys 
<br>
with box cutters would get very far in taking over an airplane today.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, universal surveillance has some serious flaws.  As fast as 
<br>
we could install the system the bad guys would be out there subverting it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand if you read the sites I have given you, you will 
<br>
find an excellent analysis by Russian intelligence analyzing what is going 
<br>
wrong around the world.  They seem to think the trouble spots of the world 
<br>
are those places that were formerly Soviet clients.  If you read Barnett's 
<br>
analysis (found on line) from the March Esquire you will find that him and 
<br>
the Russians agree on which countries are the problem spots.  In other words 
<br>
there is a well established set of theories that agree on the problem and on 
<br>
the solution.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you agree with DeSoto then the solution is much less expensive than 
<br>
installing a universal surveillance system.  In fact, DeSoto says that 
<br>
sufficient capital exists in each of the 3rd world countries to lift them 
<br>
into modernity.  He also suggests how to get this done through the existing 
<br>
political systems.  He has demonstrated that his changes are politically 
<br>
attainable.  Surprise, surprise, politicians love doing things that are 
<br>
politically popular and get them reelected.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, anyone that bothers to get on line and reads the English 
<br>
language editions of middle eastern newspapers will find that it is the 
<br>
dictators of those countries that are keeping the terrorists stirred up.  
<br>
