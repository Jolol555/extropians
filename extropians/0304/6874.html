<p>This is going to be *very* tricky -- you have to tell most of cells
<br>
in the body to enter a CR state but you have to tell the appetite
<br>
sensing mechanisms in the brain that you *aren't* CR.

<p>Real fixes are probably going to require biobots or nanobots.  Until we
<br>
have them we will just be in postponement mode.

<p><em>&gt; If neither has happened in a decade from now, I, for one, will be

</em><br>
<p>I'm guessing we will probably have biobots before we really understand
<br>
enough to program them to help deal with the problem.  We really need
<br>
the elephant and bowhead (or blue) whale genomes and we aren't likely
<br>
to get those until late in the decade.  And we probably will not get
<br>
nanobots for 20 years minimum.
