</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory tells us very little about what's healthy for humans past that

<em>&gt; age.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Humans are adapted to an environment with no antibiotics, no basic

<p>This is not how Paleo diet theory works.
<br>
<p>The way Paleo diet theory works is that you make sense of the human 
<br>
metabolism by assuming that it evolved to fit a Paleolithic diet, then you 
<br>
feed that metabolism whatever makes it work best, whether or not that 
<br>
constitutes a Paleolithically realistic food supply.
<br>
<p>Think of it as a two-cycle step:
<br>
<p>1)  Early humans adapt toward metabolisms making better use of the 
<br>
available paleolithic diet.  I.e., metabolism optimized for presented diet.
<br>
<p>2)  Modern humans deduce which modernly possible diet provides the best 
<br>
fuel for the evolved metabolism.  I.e., diet optimized for presented 
<br>
metabolism.
<br>
<p>Step 2 is not necessarily going to reproduce the diet found in step 1, BUT 
<br>
there will be major similarities; a lot of modern diets will be &quot;bad&quot; 
<br>
because they casually violate invariants that our metabolism treats as 
<br>
engineering assumptions; and nothing about the human metabolism makes a 
<br>
damn bit of sense unless you understand step 1.
<br>
<p>Given the number of dietary problems that result from violating ancestral 
<br>
invariants, and the incoherence of modern dietary science, it makes sense 
<br>
to be cautious.
