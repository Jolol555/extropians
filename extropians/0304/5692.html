</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be God's creation?  I guess you're safe from theism because this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; looks like a clearly impossible hoop to jump through.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Does not follow.  God could be the framework, or could be outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; framework, or whatever it is the theologians insist on.  The only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; requirement for consilience is that the explanation be consistent. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Physics is consilient with biology, for example, and physics is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; lifeform among other lifeforms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So what does a purported creator being consistent with the creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; look like?  Or is that not the criteria you would use?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An example of inconsistency is the assertion that God predates all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics and existence, yet contains complex dynamic structure, and
</em><br>
<p>This isn't an inconsistency if one understands instead that the gods, 
<br>
being the foundation of mind, exist before the mind exists, and 
<br>
therefore were present before the mind started observing.  And since 
<br>
they are the foundation of mind, whenever one tries to create a new 
<br>
concept, some pre-verbal (usually pre-conscious, but that's a bit 
<br>
undefined) god is activated to manifest the idea.  It removes time from 
<br>
the centerpoint of consciousness, but then that's consistent with what 
<br>
the &quot;deep psychologists&quot; have found.  &quot;I&quot; is a quite abstract creation, 
<br>
and can't be an early part of the creation of mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; behaves in an anthropomorphic fashion, showing emotions that are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signature of sustained natural selection in a game-theoretical context.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this I believe to be a mistake.  People always try to make 
<br>
something unknown into something familiar, so they tell stories that 
<br>
cause the gods to appear as if they were people, but this doesn't 
<br>
connect with their reality, and most gnostics of whatever persuasion, 
<br>
and even most who were only liberal theologicians, would agree with this. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The simplest explanation for memes containing such assertions is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are the confabulations of storytellers who lacked the scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge and investigative mindset to detect the inconsistencies in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own stories, and simply made stuff up that sounded good to them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while transparently ridiculous from the view of later centuries.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is conceptually possible that despite such storytelling having a clear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and consilient explanation as fiction, there is nonetheless some even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler explanation under which it is true.  But I am not holding my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breath. 
</em><br>
<p>There's the fiction, and then there's the reality.  Both exist.  But the 
<br>
reality doesn't look much like the fiction, because the &quot;numenous&quot; 
<br>
qualities don't translate into the story form at all well, but they are 
<br>
what makes the visitations significant, not the pedestrian events that 
<br>
occured.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, the successive theological rationalization of such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confabulations farther and farther away from the original unpalatable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictions has produced a great deal of extremely vague spirituality.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This vague spirituality allows people with moderate levels of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific literacy to deceive themselves without believing things so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blatantly ridiculous that they would lose their self-respect.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such defensive rationalization is not any more likely to be correct, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor will the new fictions produced be able to fool anyone with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher level of scientific knowledge or less eagerness to be deceived.
</em><br>
<p>I've certainly run into that.  But this isn't evidence that this is all 
<br>
that exists.
