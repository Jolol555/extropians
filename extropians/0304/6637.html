It's
<br>
<em>&gt; a question of who has the burden of proof.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>I think the default of most people, scientist, and nutrition scientists is
<br>
the
<br>
<p>status quo.  In order to recommend action especially action that changes the
<br>
<p>dietary habits of many people some level of proof is required.  My personal
<br>
<p>default is whatever I happen to do and like.  In order to change eating
<br>
patterns
<br>
<p>I require good evidence (or personal whim).  I developed this system many
<br>
<p>years ago to deal with the large number of health claims I encounter.
<br>
<p><p><p>When I first heard the paleodiet idea it sounded like nonsense but after
<br>
<p>seeing folks argue for a few days I think it is an interesting theory.  The
<br>
<p>idea that what our ancestors ate during the Paleolithic period is an
<br>
especially
<br>
<p>good base diet for modern humans could provide a wealth of experimental
<br>
<p>ideas for nutritional scientist (if they have not already looked in that
<br>
direction).
<br>
<p>However, it is just a theory.  It could go wrong in many ways, some of which
<br>
<p>have been brought up in this thread.
<br>
<p><p><p>What was the paleo diet?  Was there one diet or many?  How similar is our
<br>
<p>metabolism to theirs?  How adaptable is that metabolism?  What did their
<br>
<p>diet optimize?  What do we want to optimize?  Are paleo foods even available
<br>
<p>and practical?  What do we actually know from nutritional biochemistry and
<br>
<p>nutritional studies of humans?  How does what we know match up with common
<br>
<p>diets, established nutritional recommendations, and paleo diet theory?  Lots
<br>
of
<br>
<p>unknowns makes it hard to guess the right answers.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am curious what knowledgeable paleodiet proponents think of caloric
<br>
<p>restriction.  It also seems to me that animal nutrition ought to come into
<br>
<p>this discussion.  What diets are good for mammals?  What diets are good
<br>
<p>for primates?  What diets are good for primates closest to humans
<br>
<p>(orangutans, bonobos, chimpanzees and gorillas are in the same family
<br>
<p>(Pongidae))?  The concept of biochemical individuality also seems worth
<br>
<p>mentioning.
<br>
<p><p><p>It seems to me that if a theoretical paleo diet does not violate any proven
<br>
<p>nutritional principals it's a fine thing for some group of people to try and
<br>
<p>compare to other diets.  Agriculture for group survival looks like a rather
<br>
<p>successful experiment but that does not mean it can not be improved on
<br>
<p>by individuals.  I think any diet theory would get trumpeted by good
<br>
<p>experimental or biochemical data though.  Are there any populations that
<br>
<p>eat close to a paleo diet available for monitoring?
<br>
<p><p><p>Maybe a tug of war between ten paleo diet advocates and and ten devotes of
<br>
<p>the current food pyramid would be the best way to decide the argument in the
<br>
<p>mean time.  :)
