<em>&gt; &gt; OTOH, I found this rather reasonable, (dare I say it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanist?) interview with Crichton online.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.readersread.com/features/michaelcrichton.htm">http://www.readersread.com/features/michaelcrichton.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He is not ignorant about current technologies, and seems in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this interview to be rather in favour of them. Now I'm confused.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Crichton is a pretty intelligent guy, If you find this article in favor of
<br>
advancing tech but note his book is generally negative, perhaps he does not
<br>
feel his book will have any affect on public opinion or the future course of
<br>
tech anyway, or that it even might have a positive effect.
<br>
<p>I think the negative comments on this list give too much credit to the
<br>
ability of popular fiction like this to truly sway public opinion.  Ask your
<br>
non-extropic girlfriend if she finds the doom and gloom fiction books to be
<br>
accurate representations of likely future scenerios.  I doubt anyone is
<br>
rushing to ban geological research after viewing &quot;The Core&quot; It seems most
<br>
movies (and stories) seem to be about a overcoming a trial that befells the
<br>
protagonists.  Very few books dont have some this kind of competition theme
<br>
to them.  I think the majority of the public fully acknowledges this, and
<br>
the huge fears about this book swaying public opinion dont give enough
<br>
credit to the intelligence of the average person.  There can be a lot said,
<br>
in fact, to the claim that Crichtons book would make more people aware of
<br>
nanotech who otherwise would not be.  After someone finishes that book, is
<br>
it more likely their first thought would be &quot;Agh! We have to ban any
<br>
research on this stuff&quot; or &quot;fun story,  this nanotech stuff sounds
<br>
interesting&quot;
<br>
<p>Just my 2c
