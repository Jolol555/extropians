</em><br>
<p>Ja I think so, but I see where you are going with
<br>
this argument.  The halucination would need to be
<br>
a really good one, like Dr. Arroway's, with lotsa
<br>
feeling and insight.  It would need good qualia.
<br>
Whatever that is.  {8^D
<br>
<p>The god I could be convinced of is a Bradburian
<br>
god (Robert, not Ray), an advanced lifeform that
<br>
had mastered nanotech and interstellar travel, a
<br>
wispy nanobot arm of a distant MBrain.  I don't know
<br>
what it would take to convince me of an Old-Testament-
<br>
style yahwey or allah who creates universes.  A lot
<br>
more than even a good or repeatable halucination
<br>
methinks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, if we are talking about God vs some other more advanced species 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which had no real creative role in this mess I think we are talking 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ja, and that is why I found the god-experience in
<br>
Contact so very satisfying.  The advanced alien
<br>
who imitated Dr.Arroway's father was so humble,
<br>
yet still so technologically capable, while never
<br>
claiming to be universe creators.  That last part where
<br>
he said &quot;We don't know who built it,&quot;  that really got
<br>
me.  One would hafta love the guy.  Or thing.
<br>
<p>I could be convinced that somewhere in the stellar
<br>
neighborhood, something like that exists, since it
<br>
would be explainable via evolution: an advanced,
<br>
perhaps humanlike species managed to merge intelligences
<br>
the way humankind is struggling to do today.  This
<br>
primitive planet is standing on the threshold, perhaps
<br>
only fifty to a couple hundred years from spawning a
<br>
god.  Could we really be the very first planet since
<br>
the Big Bang to get this far?
