hits:

<p><p><em>&gt;The problem in the 20s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and 30s was that everyone was so poor they couldn't even live as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large families, much less alone.  
</em><br>
<p><p>Yeah, that was indeed a problem.  And the blood of people who are
<br>
mostly dead now was spilled then to help solve that little problem.
<br>
Of course there were other factors.....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The minimum wage did nothing at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to fix that problem; indeed, it probably delayed recovery.
</em><br>
<p><p>And your evidence? I provided some (see above)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The point of my question is this: why, if a person living with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parents or roommates or some other cheap arrangement wishes to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a job that supply-and-demand happens to make worth less than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amount he'd need to live on his own do we think it's &quot;right&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tell him that he isn't allowed to take that job?
</em><br>
<p>Because that is the essence of collective bargaining when you have
<br>
multiple &quot;owners.&quot;  For example, suppose you and I and 10 other people
<br>
own a property.  
<br>
4 owners are rich and they would rather wait until the price rises
<br>
some more, say 1 year from now.  
<br>
<p>4 other owners who are middle class would rather sell 6 months from
<br>
now when the price has risen only slighly. 
<br>
<p>4 owners who are starving would rather sell now.
<br>
The time of sale then is subject to compromise and negotiation, e.g.,
<br>
the property is sold 6 months from now.
<br>
<p>When it comes to minimum wage, we also have the high end of net worth
<br>
(they do not want any minimum wage).  Also, those who are not in the
<br>
high end, but who  fancy themselves in the high end Real Soon
<br>
Now...they also are against the minimum wage.
<br>
<p>And we have the middle class who think it does not affect them at all.
<br>
<p>And we have the working poor who BENEFIT DIRECTLY from the minimum
<br>
wage.
<br>
<p>And we have the third world illegal immigrants, whom it hurts.
<br>
<p>Again, a process of negotiation ensues, theoretically....
