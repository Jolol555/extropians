<em>&gt; I've never seen any credible evidence that prehistoric cultures subsisted on

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers, such as the one I quoted here, he estimates as much 75% of calories

</em><br>
<p>Isn't it likely that the diets of prehistoric people varied tremendously
<br>
from season to season and even from day to day?  (And from place to
<br>
place?)  Some days they'd get lucky and find meat; some days they'd
<br>
get really lucky and find a lot of meat; then there would be dry spells
<br>
where they'd have to subsist on other foods.  Some seasons game would
<br>
be plentiful and rich; others it would be rare and/or of poor quality.
<br>
<p>You can crank all this variability down and come up with a figure like
<br>
45% or 75% of calories from animal sources, but how meaningful is that?
<br>
The truth is that early diets were controlled by season and circumstance.
<br>
People did not have the choice that we do every day as to what food
<br>
to eat.  They ate what was available.
<br>
<p>In those circumstances, humans had to evolve to be able to tolerate a
<br>
wide variation in diets, from periods of no meat to periods of almost
<br>
100% meat.  No doubt somewhere in that continuum is an optimal point
<br>
(different for each person actually!).  But you're not going to find it
<br>
out by averaging food consumption over the year or over a lifetime for
<br>
some particular prehistoric culture.
