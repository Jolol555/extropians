<em>&gt; Oh, definitely.  But you have to get calories too.  And the link between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saturated fat and heart disease seems pretty strong, so I'd be careful with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the meat and fowl.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have time currently to do much more than skim this 
<br>
list, but I would like to chime in here and give my opinion that based 
<br>
on some reading I've been doing lately I am beginning to believe that, 
<br>
along with the &quot;food pyramid&quot;, the &quot;lipid hypothesis&quot; is also going to 
<br>
end up being absolutely wrong. In fact, just like how all the refined 
<br>
carbs the food pyramid advised us to eat likely ended up causing 
<br>
rampaging obesity/diabetes/etc. in the US population, not getting enough 
<br>
natural saturated fats while eating likely harmful manufactured 
<br>
polyunsaturated and other fats is likely also causing multiple diseases. 
<br>
Some of these manufactured fats are likely carcinogenic/toxins, and many 
<br>
are pro-oxidants.
<br>
<p>If you actually go and look at the &quot;research&quot; purporting to show 
<br>
negative effects of saturated fats you find that for the most part the 
<br>
studies have such poor design/implementation that they are essentially 
<br>
worthless. In some cases it is so bad you wonder if they were trying on 
<br>
purpose to achieve a particular result. In fact this trend of very poor 
<br>
experimental design seems to run rampant through pretty much all areas 
<br>
of nutritional research. It appears that based on some jumping to 
<br>
conclusions and poorly done experiments a consesnsus formed early on 
<br>
among most scientists regarding the idea that &quot;fat is bad&quot;, etc. Is it a 
<br>
coincidence that a lot of scientists in this area are backed by funds 
<br>
from the manufactured food industry? Why is it that in the early 20th 
<br>
century there were only a few thousand heart attacks in the USA, but 
<br>
later on when we began eliminating natural forms of fat from our diet 
<br>
and replacing it with manufactured fats and other foods that we suddenly 
<br>
had a crisis on our hands?
<br>
<p>What I can certainly also say however is that this area is so complex 
<br>
and nowhere near fully understood that no one can yet say for sure what 
<br>
is the best way to eat. We certainly would have better info at this 
<br>
point though if more people would have broken away over the last 30+ 
<br>
years from the &quot;regime&quot; of the lipid hypothesis and performed more 
<br>
independent research IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I'm on a budget.  Grains and beans are cheap.  (I miss Trader Joe's and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole wheat pasta which wasn't a price ripoff.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I've read the experiences of some people who have switched to eating a 
<br>
more primitive, high fat diet, and not only are things like liver, other 
<br>
organ meats, and high fat foods fairly cheap but they find that eating 
<br>
plenty of fat makes you naturally desire to eat less. So it ends up 
<br>
being not that expensive at all. Obviously if you do it the way many 
<br>
Atkins Dieters do and just eat filet mignon and other expensive forms of 
<br>
high protein meat you will have a different experience, but I don't 
<br>
think this is the meat with the best nutritional value- especially 
<br>
corn/grain fed meat.
<br>
<p>P.S. For those who say calories are calories are calories, I would say 
<br>
two things: 1) it has been shown that your GI tract can absorb fully 
<br>
100% of the protein and carbs you eat, but only can absorb fats at the 
<br>
rate of around 12 to 15 grams per hour. So there is a limit to how many 
<br>
fat calories you can absorb in a given time. 2) now that there are 
<br>
finally some studies going on comparing alternate diets with the &quot;low 
<br>
fat paradigm&quot; it appears that many of them show people lose 
<br>
significantly more weight on various low carb/high fat diets even when 
<br>
eating the same or higher amounts of calories.
<br>
<p>P.P.S. Three other interesting ideas worthy of researching: 1) normal 
<br>
cholesterol is actually an antioxidant and actual proof showing that 
<br>
moderately high (300 combined or below) levels of it has any negative 
<br>
effect on cardio health is extremely lacking. In fact, people with too 
<br>
little of it are more likely to have health problems. 2) studies appear 
<br>
to show that saturated fat consumption has no bearing on the amount of 
<br>
atherosclerosis detectable in post-mortem studies. In fact in areas such 
<br>
as Japan that are perceived to eat healthier diets they actually suffer 
<br>
more of this disease as they get older. 3) more recent research is 
<br>
beginning to show that what actually causes heart disease is an 
<br>
inflammation process, which actually has little if any relation to the 
<br>
particular fats and cholesterol that most doctors and individuals in the 
<br>
USA currently believe is the cause. What causes this inflammation is a 
<br>
very interesting topic...
