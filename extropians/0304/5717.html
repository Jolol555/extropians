<p>Yes.  I changed my mind a few times since I've been here.  There 
<br>
were positions I expounded and was called on that on further 
<br>
reflection and following leads given here I decided I was either 
<br>
mistaken about or my view was not balanced.  The latest place 
<br>
where I believe my view was not balanced was due to the 
<br>
persistence of some folks that I look at what the US has done 
<br>
both for the good as well as the bad.  After 9/11, I started 
<br>
looking for why people in many parts of the world might be that 
<br>
angry with the US.  What I found shocked and sickened me.  I was 
<br>
like many here in not being very aware of the dark side.  But in 
<br>
seeing that I lost sight of some of the good as well.
<br>
<p>Gaining more balance, something that is in progress and not 
<br>
completed or likely to be as long as I'm still thinking, does 
<br>
not persuade me this war is any more correct.  But I was out of 
<br>
balance.
