<p>
(I am reaching my eight-posts-per-day limit, so this is off-list.)
<br>
<p>You wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; The only way I know of currently to activate these pathways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to remove some of the essential amino acids from the diet.
</em><br>
<p>Should this read &quot;non-essential&quot; amino acids?
<br>
<p>&quot;Essential&quot; aminos are those that cannot be synthesized in the body from
<br>
other aminos and must be eaten in the diet.  &quot;Non-essential&quot; aminos are
<br>
those that can be synthesized in the body from other aminos and do not have
<br>
to be eaten in the diet.
<br>
<p>I think eliminating some &quot;non-essential&quot; aminos in the diet would lead to
<br>
more synthesis of new aminos from other aminos and the synthesis of new
<br>
proteins.  Eliminating &quot;essential&quot; aminos would cause a deficiency that the
<br>
body could not recover utilizing other aminos.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only way I know of currently would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be to live on a diet biased towards beans or corn.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both of these may be deficient in one or more of the essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amino acids (Harvey or gts or someone may want to confirm this).
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  They are not totally deficient in any one, but there is a definite
<br>
limiting factor where some are represented at much higher levels than
<br>
others.  Beans and corn are both &quot;incomplete&quot; proteins which can be combined
<br>
together to form &quot;complete&quot; proteins, but the body would have to put them
<br>
together.  (Nutritional labels only show the &quot;complete&quot; protein portion.
<br>
The &quot;incomplete&quot; portions are not reported.  Combining beans and corn will
<br>
result in more complete protein being available to the body than the sum of
<br>
the two protein labels would indicate.)
<br>
<p>I just posted some comments that my veggie diet might have this side-effect
<br>
of creating more new proteins, and I am intrigued about this PR idea.  I am
<br>
not sure if the protein restriction is reducing the amount of protein the
<br>
body can produce, or if it avoids the condition of excess proteins being
<br>
available that are not needed.
