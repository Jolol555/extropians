</em><br>

<p>Perhaps some media mogul should create a &quot;Military News&quot; channel for your
<br>
liking. The cable news market seems to be able to find a way to fill every
<br>
possible market niche (The History Channel, the Discovery Channel, etc,
<br>
etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that FOX makes a secret of its intentionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right-winged biased editorials, but in general the network offers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; almost nothing from the &quot;other side.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, O'Reilly, who you hate, ALWAYS has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition on for every issue debated. 
</em><br>
<p>But he seldom invites guests who aren't easy and juicy targets for the
<br>
right, and then he barely gives them an opportunity to present their views.
<br>
That show is appropriately titled &quot;The O'Reilly Factor.&quot; It's all about what
<br>
Bill O'Reilly thinks, and to hell with anyone who disagrees.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Max More's experience on Crossfire is representative of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that show (and it is) you are entirely wrong. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about More's experience on Crossfire. It's unfortunate that
<br>
neither the left nor the right are especially sympathetic to
<br>
extropianism/transhumanism. I'd wager More would be treated even worse on
<br>
FOX.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Regarding Neil Cavuto's scathing ad hominem attack on the professor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at FOX: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll note here that you don't seem to be quoting anything the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; professor said in his letter to Cavuto. Such is evidence of bias.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Excuse me, Mike, but neither did Cavuto. I don't have any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information about the professor's supposed letter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you should have watched the show as it was originally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadcast. I did, and Cavuto did, in fact, read the letter on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually I did watch the show as it was originally broadcast. And checking
<br>
the transcript at www.foxnews.com, yes I do see that you're right that
<br>
Cavuto quoted an excerpt from the professor's letter. The portion of the
<br>
letter as quoted however contained only the professor's complaint that
<br>
journalists like Cavuto should not be so biased and a rather unpleasant
<br>
accusation that Cavuto &quot;had no right having a show.&quot; The professor's
<br>
complaint was arguably objectionable, and I don't blame Cavuto for
<br>
disagreeing and defending himself, but the professor's letter did not
<br>
contain anything approaching the level of the slanderous epithets and
<br>
scathing vitriolic in Cavuto's childish response.
