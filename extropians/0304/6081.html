</em><br>
<p>Quite frankly I prefer to speak only on things I know of and have a
<br>
reasonably decent understanding of, is that so wrong?  Perhaps if others on
<br>
this list made an effort to do that more, the single to noise ratio on this
<br>
list would be a litter more preferable.
<br>
<p>I could of course reply to you 'are you going to address or concede the
<br>
point that food is obviously more abundant and cheaper than ever before?'
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If I have no home
<br>
<em>&gt; or cooking facilities the types of food I can buy are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; severely limited and per unit of nutrition much more expensive.
</em><br>
<p>Again, the blame of the oppresive tyrannical governments that control most
<br>
3rd world nations, not the fact that we dont have enough cheap nutritious
<br>
food.  Governments, I might add, that you tend to disagree with the US
<br>
removal of.    But let me ask you this, which would you rather have
<br>
<p>1) enough food to survive and no house
<br>
2) a house but starve to death.
<br>
<p>I think the choice is clear, the fact that even the poorest of the poor in
<br>
the worst countries get 30% more calories today than they did 30 years ago
<br>
is clearly an extropic starting point.  1st, lets keep people from starving
<br>
to death, THEN lets give them a warm place to sleep.  But to do either of
<br>
these at any reasonable rate, you must get rid of the murderous despotic
<br>
governments that rule and enslave these people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Are you going to attempt to say that the cost of living in say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1970 dollars has not risen and risen dramatically in the last 32
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That being said, Ill comment on it since you are so concerned with what I
<br>
think of the cost of residence. Though I have not investigated this in
<br>
depth, I find it somewhat reasonable to assume that it may be increasing,
<br>
given land and property are probably the most definitely finite resource
<br>
around.  Where other resources get cheaper as we are able to produce and
<br>
acquire them better, and we dont look to be running out of them anytime
<br>
soon, land is a different story.  There is only so much land on the coast of
<br>
California, so that land will necessarily get real expensive.  Similiarly
<br>
there is only so much reasonably buildable land as well, so it stands to
<br>
reason as the amount of buildable land decreases, costs increase.  The
<br>
growing number of regulations imposed on building requirements certianly
<br>
helps to raise this cost dramatically as well.  However, technology has also
<br>
enabled costs of construction to continually decrease, but when buying
<br>
propery, its the land that is the biggest cost of the acquisition typically.
<br>
The only thing I can see to change this trend is more available land, which
<br>
would either mean less regulations on building (heights and distances
<br>
between buildings and such) or water based floating platforms, underground
<br>
dwellings, or cheap access to space.
<br>
<p>But, I would challenge  your assertion that 'cost of living' has increased
<br>
'dramatically' in 1970 dollars in the last 32 years.  Assuming cost of
<br>
living includes food, clothing, housing, etc, I would wager it has decreased
<br>
primarily because 1) food, clothing, etc have decreased so much and 2)
<br>
people in densely populated areas just live in smaller places.  But I would
<br>
welcome any evidence you can provide to support your claim.
