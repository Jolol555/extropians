Here's something from the CR Society list. They've chewed this topic over
<br>
before, apparently.

<p>The subject of Methionine Restriction, the primary topic of this article,
<br>
has been discussed several times recently on the CR list, with much more
<br>
rigor than it appears to have been in the extropian thread, thanks mostly to
<br>
our man Michael Rae.  Here is a link to a very interesting thread on the
<br>
subject (found using an archive search of &quot;methionine&quot; with the author field
<br>
containing &quot;cadvision&quot; (MR's internet service provider):
<br>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/9ya6">http://tinyurl.com/9ya6</a>

<br>
<p>where Michael expresses optimism on the possibility of life extension via
<br>
methionine restriction, but also recommends *against* trying it for now -
<br>
too risky.
<br>
<p>But later, in the following post, he seems to have tempered his optimism. In
<br>
it he points to evidence posted to sci.l-e by Steve Herris that methionine
<br>
restriction might be a form of &quot;crypto CR&quot; - i.e. works by reducing food
<br>
intake of animals:

<br>
<p>In short, it appears the met-restricted animals were *offered* as much food
<br>
as the AL fed controls.  But as a result of lifelong met-restriction, their
<br>
growth was stunted.  As a result of their stunted growth they likely ate
<br>
less food than their AL brethren (despite being offered as much), and may
<br>
have garnered the benefits of CR through this reduced food intake.
<br>
<p>These discussions were took place at least 6 months ago, and perhaps Michael
<br>
has more to say about the subject of methionine restriction now.
