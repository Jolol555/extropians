Keith points out the great site
<br>
<p><em>&gt; www.WeLoveTheIraqiInformationMinister.com
</em><br>
<p>and it's a pity that anyone with that much talent can't
<br>
at least get his own talk show.  My favorite quote was
<br>
from Jean-Pierre McGarrigle:
<br>
<p>&quot;In an age of spin, al-Sahaf offers feeling and authenticity. His message is consistent -- unshakeable, in fact, no matter the
<br>
evidence -- but he commands daily attention by his on-the-spot, invective-rich variations on the theme. His lunatic counterfactual
<br>
art is more appealing than the banal awfulness of the Reliable Sources. He is a Method actor in a production that will close in a
<br>
couple of days. He stands superior to truth.&quot;
<br>
<p>but al-Sahaf's parting shot to us all:  &quot;You are too far from
<br>
reality&quot;, must come a close second.
<br>
<p>On a more serious note, Keith also writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect that al-Sahaf was charged with preserving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam's honor in the Arab community and for the history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books, and Al-Jazeera's lack of complicity was unexpected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not a little offensive.  To be sure, Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aristocratic society boasts similar memes.  There's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ESS there somewhere, I fathom.
</em><br>
<p>An off-list correspondent has brought to my attention that I began
<br>
using the term &quot;ESS&quot; (Evolutionarily Stable Strategy) as if it
<br>
were /wrong/ Evolutionarily Successful Strategy /wrong/.
<br>
<p>ESS is a term perhaps first used by John Maynard Smith in
<br>
his book &quot;Evolution and the Theory of Games&quot;.  My familiarity
<br>
with the term comes from Axelrod's work in the late eighties
<br>
---probably many of you are familiar with the &quot;Tit-for-tat&quot;
<br>
results, and the issues concerning whether or not a society
<br>
can be invaded by strangers who have different strategies for
<br>
cooperation or defection.
<br>
<p>Some time in the last five years I have began loosely using
<br>
the term to refer to what is merely a &quot;successful strategy&quot;
<br>
for a subgroup or subspecies, or a memeplex, which waxes
<br>
dominant within its larger group.  Sorry for the confusion.
<br>
The term ESS should be used only in the narrower sense.
<br>
<p>Lee
