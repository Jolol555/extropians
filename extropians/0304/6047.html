<p><em>&gt; Today, David Rocci was convicted and sentenced to five months in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jail and a hefty fine for selling Xbox mod chips, which are used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumvent the encryption technology that makes them only run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approved games.  You need such a chip to install Linux on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Xbox, for example.  This is exactly the kind of world I fear, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws intended &quot;to promote the progress of science and the useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arts&quot; are in fact used to physically seize and imprison prople for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inventing and selling a device that makes the hardware you paid for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more useful.  This action, and others like it (such as the arrest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dmitri Sklyarov) are utterly unconcionable in a free society, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will ultimately retard the very progress they claim to promote.
</em><br>
<p>This is a big topic and I don't have room to go into it now.  I agree
<br>
that the current intellectual property laws are highly problematic.
<br>
Nevertheless I see many unanswered questions in how things would work
<br>
if we get to where there is no IP protection.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; My question is simple: how will TC technology fit into a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alongside what I consider to be basic, fundamental human rights:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely, the right to use, modify, combine, destroy, and otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tinker with anything you own and any knowledge in your head for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any purpose you desire?
</em><br>
<p>I agree that these are desirable capabilities.  But I see other rights as
<br>
superceding them: the right to self-ownership; the right to contract; the
<br>
right to make agreements and bind yourself to them.  You have the right
<br>
to promise to keep secrets!  Whether it is holding private a confidence
<br>
revealed by your lover, or agreeing not to make copies of a downloaded
<br>
Disney movie, you have the right to promise to limit what you will do
<br>
with information.  Trusted Computing can be an integral part of those
<br>
kind of promises (well, the downloads, anyway).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In the examples you've given, trusted machines send encrypted IDs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hashes of code back to servers.  What would prevent someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from building a machine to falsify those reports so that he could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run something the third party didn't want him to (but presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally acquired)?  Nothing technical that I can see; even if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took the strongest precautions (which it doesn't appear they are),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might still involve only cracking some encryption, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly feasible.  The only thing to prevent this, then, is law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Force.  TC will be utterly useless without laws to enforce the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a creator of content has the right to control what you can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with /your/ legally-purchased machine and /your/ legally-acquired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, just because he's the one who found or created that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information first. 
</em><br>
<p>Nothing prevents anyone from doing it in theory, least of all the law,
<br>
because you can hack your own machine in the privacy of your home.
<br>
The only thing that would prevent it in practice is that it might be a
<br>
lot of work, and future versions will make it even more work.  There is a
<br>
cryptographic key generated in the secure hardware that is designed never
<br>
to leave the chip.  There are techniques to pull data out of chips, but
<br>
they require expensive laboratories.  And there are some other possible
<br>
hacks I've seen mentioned, like substituting dual-ported RAM so you can
<br>
peek at memory, or maybe trying to induce faults in the secure hardware
<br>
and get it to leak some data.  No doubt we will see an ongoing battle
<br>
between hackers and &quot;data hiders&quot; just like in the satellite TV market.
<br>
<p>The initial goal of the TC technology isn't to stop all hacking, but
<br>
to get away from the situation we are in today, of point-and-click
<br>
unauthorized file sharing.  Then down the line, it's possible that
<br>
security can be improved.  I go back to Drexler's sealed assembler lab
<br>
as a model for how to put something in a black box where nobody can poke
<br>
at it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sure, there are probably some useful things enabled by TC.  But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they require abandoning basic human rights, they're not worth it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As they say, Mussolini made the trains run on time.  OK, so TCPA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might get me more music or movies than I might otherwise.  But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the price is paying tribute to Disney for the privilege to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my movie on my machine only on /their/ terms, I'll pass.
</em><br>
<p>Even if TC had nothing that I considered useful, I would still support
<br>
marketing efforts to try out the technology.  Maybe other people will
<br>
find it useful.  And if not, it will fail in the marketplace.  What I
<br>
object to is the preemptive judgement that TCPA/Palladium are evil and
<br>
should be opposed.
