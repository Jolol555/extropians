<p><em>&gt; Harvey as gts tried to point out to you, historical evidence

<em>&gt; out here there was a very dramatic rise in heart disease (especially

</em><br>
<p>I've been meaning to address this question of the recent blossom in the 20th
<br>
century of certain diseases before I run away for the Easter weekend...
<br>
<p>In the early to mid 1900's nutritional scientists started to blame saturated
<br>
fat for heart disease. While such concerns are not totally without merit, it
<br>
triggered an irrational fear of natural animal-based food products and
<br>
inspired the explosion in highly unsaturated high omega-6 vegetable oils
<br>
(worsening the already unhealthy Omega-6/Omega-3 balance), extremely
<br>
unhealthy man-made trans-fatty acids (which make cell membranes less
<br>
permeable), and high-carb highly glycemic processed foods that bill
<br>
themselves as &quot;low-fat&quot; (which place a strain on the pancreas leading to
<br>
diabetes and other associated diseases including heart disease). As Brian
<br>
notes, it also led to the USDA high-carb grain-based &quot;food pyramid&quot;. The
<br>
food pyramid in turn led to feeding school children junk food for their
<br>
school lunches. Kids in public schools started eating things like pizza and
<br>
high-fructose corn syrup sodas for lunch. Those kids are now adults but the
<br>
current generation of kids are still eating the same garbage. Many of their
<br>
parents feed them the same kinds of foods for breakfast and dinner, having
<br>
been brain-washed by the supposed wisdom of government sponsored nutrition
<br>
science. 
<br>
<p>These factors have placed us further away from the natural paleodiet than
<br>
ever in the past. Since then we've seen an explosion in certain types of
<br>
heart disease, obesity, type II diabetes, syndrome X (a pre-diabetic
<br>
syndrome marked by insulin resistance) and other health problems. 
<br>
<p>We are very fortunate that medical science has in many respects kept pace
<br>
with the problems that come from poor diet. Were it not for the tremendous
<br>
advances in medical science over the last century I think Americans would be
<br>
in danger of extinction. :-)
