<em>&gt;&gt;Ramez I was talking about a specific form of heart disease

<em>&gt; Sorry, I should have caught that.  Interesting.  I'm tempted to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is just a classification issue, with the likelihood of calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something a heart attack rising over time more quickly than the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incidence of heart attacks.  However, I honestly don't have the data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to support that opinion.  It does seem rather odd.  Time for more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;From what I've read it appears to be a completely new heart problem, 
<br>
which was first spotted I think somewhere in the second half of the 
<br>
1800's. I think they were advanced enough then with autopsies and such 
<br>
that they had a decent grasp of common heart conditions which AFAIK were 
<br>
always slow lingering long term diseases ending in heart failure. MIs 
<br>
are a completely different animal and have clearly much different and 
<br>
sudden symptoms and deaths. At any rate, I too would like to know why 
<br>
they apparently jumped so much from 1930 to the mid 50's.
<br>
<p>Even though the death rate from MIs and other heart disease has been 
<br>
decreasing for the past few decades, this is exclusively due to better 
<br>
treaments we have developed for the symptoms. In terms of the indidence 
<br>
of heart disease, I believe it is still rising.
