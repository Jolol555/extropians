I missed U.S. tv news coverage except a snippet of CNN International here and
<br>
there while overseas in Thailand and Cambodia from 27 March through 19 April.

<p><p>MRC Alert: Special Report 'Grading TV's War News'
<br>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt once observed, &quot;It is not the critic who counts, not the one
<br>
who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might
<br>
have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the
<br>
arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives
<br>
valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great
<br>
enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who,
<br>
if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at
<br>
least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with
<br>
those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.&quot;

&nbsp;MRC Special Report. &quot;Grading TV's War News: Fox News Channel and Embedded
<br>
&nbsp;Reporters Excelled, While Peter Jennings and Peter Arnett Flunked.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;As promised yesterday, below is the Executive Summary of the report by Rich
<br>
&nbsp;Noyes, Director of Research at the MRC, and myself, Brent Baker, the MRC's
<br>
&nbsp;Vice President. But first, the list of grades and assessments we issued:

<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;END List of Grades
<br>
&nbsp;Now, the text of the Executive Summary for the April 23 Special Report:
<br>
&nbsp;While it only lasted about three weeks, the second Gulf War was an
<br>
&nbsp;unqualified success. But what about TV coverage of the war? While the media
<br>
&nbsp;covered many aspects of the war fairly well-reports from embedded
<br>
&nbsp;journalists were refreshingly factual and were mostly devoid of
<br>
&nbsp;commentary-television's war news was plagued by the same problems detected
<br>
&nbsp;during previous conflicts: too little skepticism of enemy propaganda, too
<br>
&nbsp;much mindless negativism about America's military prospects, and a
<br>
&nbsp;reluctance on the part of most networks to challenge the premises of the
<br>
&nbsp;anti-war movement or expose its radical agenda.
<br>
&nbsp;Media Research Center analysts watched the war on ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN
<br>
&nbsp;and the Fox News Channel. Here are their grades for each network's
<br>
&nbsp;performance, followed by ratings for the best and worst network anchors,
<br>
&nbsp;Baghdad reporters and embedded correspondents:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grading the Networks: Fox News Channel (B) and CBS News (B-)
<br>
&nbsp;received the best grades for war coverage that correctly portrayed the U.S.
<br>
&nbsp;military effort as successful. FNC aided viewers by rejecting the standard
<br>
&nbsp;liberal idea that objective war news requires an indifference to whether
<br>
&nbsp;America succeeds or fails. Day after day, CBS's Pentagon reporter David
<br>
&nbsp;Martin gave the most accurate overview of the war's progress, although
<br>
&nbsp;others at CBS, such as Lesley Stahl, exhibited a tendency for unwarranted
<br>
&nbsp;second-guessing. FNC's final grade suffered after Geraldo Rivera disclosed
<br>
&nbsp;the location and mission of the 101st Airborne with whom he'd been traveling.
<br>
&nbsp;In contrast, ABC received a near-failing grade (D-) for knee-jerk negativism
<br>
&nbsp;that played up Iraqi claims of civilian suffering, hyped American military
<br>
&nbsp;difficulties and indulged anti-war protesters with free air time. One ABC
<br>
&nbsp;reporter (Chris Cuomo) even promoted anti-war leftists as &quot;prescient
<br>
&nbsp;indicators of the national mood,&quot; even though polls showed most Americans
<br>
&nbsp;supported the war.
<br>
&nbsp;Many of the same correspondents appeared on both NBC and MSNBC, so the
<br>
&nbsp;networks were graded as a team (C+). Both generally offered solid, factual
<br>
&nbsp;coverage, especially from their strong embedded reporters, but their anchors
<br>
&nbsp;weren't as strong as those on FNC and CBS, and both were marred by their use
<br>
&nbsp;of Peter Arnett as a Baghdad reporter. Like ABC, CNN's coverage (C+) was
<br>
&nbsp;tainted by unwarranted negativity and inordinate amount of coverage of
<br>
&nbsp;anti-war groups, although these weaknesses were offset by a stronger pool of
<br>
&nbsp;embedded reporters and more skeptical coverage of the Iraqi regime.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grading the Anchors: All of the network anchors received high
<br>
&nbsp;grades except for the highly tendentious Peter Jennings, who played up any
<br>
&nbsp;defeatist angle he could find. Five days before Baghdad fell, Pentagon
<br>
&nbsp;reporter John McWethy warned, &quot;This could be, Peter, a long war.&quot; Jennings
<br>
&nbsp;felt vindication: &quot;As many people had anticipated.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;Dan Rather's impressions of a successful U.S. drive to Baghdad were more
<br>
&nbsp;accurate than Jennings's pessimism, while NBC's Tom Brokaw, ever the steady
<br>
&nbsp;hand, usually struck a middle ground between the two. On cable, CNN's
<br>
&nbsp;daytime anchor Wolf Blitzer was solid and fair; nighttime anchor Aaron Brown
<br>
&nbsp;was more equivocal and self-conscious. On the war's third day, MSNBC's Brian
<br>
&nbsp;Williams unfortunately compared our precision bombing with the citywide
<br>
&nbsp;destruction wrought by the Allied bombing of Dresden in World War II, but he
<br>
&nbsp;rejected the same analogy in a later report. Fox's Brit Hume provided an
<br>
&nbsp;excellent one-hour summary of the war each night, while Shepard Smith kept
<br>
&nbsp;the spotlight on the battlefield and Fox's embedded correspondents.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Embedded Reporters: These reporters excelled when they acted as
<br>
&nbsp;the viewers' eyes and ears in Iraq. NBC's David Bloom, in his innovative
<br>
&nbsp;Bloommobile, was the star of the group, offering hours of riveting live
<br>
&nbsp;coverage of the Third Infantry's historic drive toward Baghdad, including a
<br>
&nbsp;powerful sandstorm that turned day into night. CNN's Walter Rodgers narrated
<br>
&nbsp;hour upon hour of armored troop movements, often under enemy fire, without
<br>
&nbsp;straying from his &quot;just the facts&quot; style, while FNC's Greg Kelly provided
<br>
&nbsp;gripping footage of the U.S. Army's devastating first thrust into Baghdad.
<br>
&nbsp;On the other hand, ABC's Ted Koppel spent his time pontificating as if
<br>
&nbsp;he-not the vast military force that surrounded him ? was the real star.
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Forget the easy victories of the last twenty years; this war is more like
<br>
&nbsp;the ones we knew before,&quot; he announced at the end of Nightline on March 24.
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;Telling you if and when things are going badly for U.S. troops, enabling
<br>
&nbsp;you to bear witness to the high cost of war, is the hard part of our job,&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;he promised viewers, &quot;We'll do our very best to give you the truth in the
<br>
&nbsp;hope and the belief that you can handle it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Baghdad Reporters: Until the Iraqi dictatorship ran away April
<br>
&nbsp;9, Baghdad-based reporters were controlled by the Ministry of Information.
<br>
&nbsp;Given the impediments to accurate reporting, networks should have used such
<br>
&nbsp;reporters sparingly. Instead, ABC gave a great deal of time to the
<br>
&nbsp;uncorroborated stories of civilian suffering which freelancer Richard Engel
<br>
&nbsp;reported. While he was still under the watchful eye of Iraqi minders, on the
<br>
&nbsp;April 2 World News Tonight, Engel highlighted the claim that the U.S. had
<br>
&nbsp;bombed a &quot;maternity hospital.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;National Geographic Explorer's Peter Arnett, who was heavily used by MSNBC
<br>
&nbsp;and NBC before he was fired, was the most outrageously biased Baghdad
<br>
&nbsp;reporter. On March 26, days before he went on Iraqi TV to bolster Saddam's
<br>
&nbsp;spin, Arnett twice told those watching NBC's Today of Iraqi claims that the
<br>
&nbsp;U.S. had used &quot;cluster bombs&quot; to kill dozens at a Baghdad marketplace, a
<br>
&nbsp;claim later rebutted by NBC's Pentagon reporter Jim Miklaszewski. Arnett's
<br>
&nbsp;servile approach to the Iraqis was in stark contrast to the New York Times's
<br>
&nbsp;John Burns, who phoned in several reports to CBS. Burns did his best to
<br>
&nbsp;expose the Iraqi propaganda.
