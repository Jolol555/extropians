Spike, 
<br>
<p>Your inspired rewriting of these classic song lyrics produced a great post! : )  I would actually like to see a musically inclined list member do the song for our listening pleasure here.
<br>
<p>I have to admit listening to the song as a teenager, and getting a big nihlistic kick out of it! lol  &quot;Yeah, you're all going to get what you deserve!&quot;  
<br>
<p>You say an actual cat wrote and sang the song? Wow!  I am surprised I didn't hear more about this amazing animal.  A post responding to yours said he had to switch to Christian music to succeed in music, but I would think Christians would consider a songwriting and singing cat to be satanic!  
<br>
<p>If only the religion of Bast were still going strong, he would have been the next Michael Meow Jackson.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John        
<br>

&gt;I saw a PBS program on folk music, which was very good.
&gt;A cat named Barry McGuire did a song called Eve of
&gt;Destruction, which was kinda catchy but with a terribly
&gt;negative outlook.  Written nearly 40 years ago, it was
&gt;about the middle east exploding, nuclear weapons dooming
&gt;us all, basically about the whole world falling into a
&gt;morass from which extrication is impossible.  Well, I
&gt;do not share that view.  So I rewrote the words a bit
&gt;to modernize the song.  It has the same tune and meter
&gt;as before, for those of you who know the 1964 version,
&gt;and it goes like this, in the key of B:
&gt;
&gt;Eve of Construction
&gt;
&gt;The modern World
&gt;It is explodin'
&gt;Technology ragin'
&gt;Our children codin'
&gt;The tyrannized people
&gt;Will soon be votin'
&gt;You don't believe in tech
&gt;But what's that computer you're totin'
&gt;And pretty soon we'll have
&gt;our brains uploadin'
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;But you tell me over, and over, and over again my friend
&gt;Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;Don't you understand what I'm tryin' to say
&gt;Can't you feel the optimism I'm feelin' today
&gt;If Eliezer is right, there's no need runnin' away
&gt;The Singularity will save
&gt;We've dug our last grave
&gt;When we knock out the aging gene
&gt;It'll be the immortal scene
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;And you tell me over, and over, and over again my friend
&gt;Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;The concept's so rad
&gt;It's better than copulatin'
&gt;I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'
&gt;I can't twist the truth
&gt;It knows no regulation
&gt;Handful of senators can't pass legislation
&gt;Luddite marches alone can't bring frustration,
&gt;When human respect is integratin'
&gt;This future world
&gt;Is just awaitin'
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;And you tell me over, and over, and over again my friend
&gt;Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;And think of all the talent there is in Red China
&gt;All the money to be made in Taxifornia
&gt;Ah you may leave here for four months in space
&gt;And when you return it's a different place
&gt;Ragin' science and technology
&gt;The pride of the human race,
&gt;You can now freeze your dead with no tears on your face
&gt;With nanotech coming, the future holds them a place.
&gt;
&gt;.
&gt;
&gt;But you tell me over, and over, and over, and over again my friend
&gt;You don't believe we're on the eve of construction
&gt;No, no, you don't believe we're on the eve of construction
&gt;
&gt;
