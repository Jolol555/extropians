<p>
I have come up with a new paradox in Special Relativity.
<br>
<p>I was explaining a typical thought experiment to an
<br>
acquaintance in order to convey why mass increase
<br>
occurs.  You have two bowlers
<br>
on the different spaceships who have their bowling
<br>
alleys aligned and perpendicular to their relative
<br>
motion.  If you believe in time dilation (for which
<br>
there is a very standard TE), then it happens that
<br>
when one bowler &quot;measures&quot; the mass of the other
<br>
bowlers ball (as it collides with his), he must conclude
<br>
that that slow moving ball on the other ship is pretty
<br>
massive.
<br>
<p>Anyway, it occurred to me that this TE was all about
<br>
*inertial* mass, and that I didn't have a TE that was
<br>
about gravitational mass.  So here it is.  Fortunately,
<br>
it can be explained without any math, but I do include
<br>
some math at the bottom of this email.  The trouble is
<br>
that its conclusion is apparently opposite to the
<br>
predictions of SR!
<br>
<p>Okay, so you are approaching a solar system at speed v
<br>
in your rocket ship, and you see a planet orbiting a
<br>
star.  You are traveling perpendicularly to the plane
<br>
of the orbit of the planet.  So imagine that the planet
<br>
is orbiting the star like the tip of a minute hand is
<br>
orbiting the center of a clock on the wall, and you are
<br>
walking towards the clock straight on.
<br>
<p>Now because physical processes happen in that solar
<br>
system in your frame of reference more slowly than they
<br>
do in the that solar system's frame, you observe that
<br>
the planet is moving around its star not very fast.  In
<br>
fact, judging from the usual mass of that kind of star,
<br>
its amazing how slowly that planet is revolving about it.
<br>
<p>So using some typical formulas, you calculate the mass
<br>
of the star, and find it to be rather picayune.  But
<br>
hold on!  Special relativity predicts that your measurements
<br>
of the star should make it *more* massive, not less.  Paradox!
<br>
<p>Anyone see a resolution to this?
<br>
<p>(Since Einstein had troubles incorporating gravity into special
<br>
relativity, I'm hopeful that this is a very meaty paradox
<br>
indeed, and shows the need for GR!)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. In order to calculate the mass of the star, note that
<br>
the acceleration of the planet can be obtained from Newton's
<br>
gravitational formula and also from the formula for centrifugal
<br>
force.  When we set these equal, we obtain  v^2/r = GM/r^2,
<br>
or r = GM/v^2.  The paradox then consists of reckoning that
<br>
since the radius of the orbit is unaffected by your motion
<br>
(it's orthogonal to it, after all), it's a constant:  so
<br>
the mass of the star is proportional to the square of the
<br>
velocity of the planet around it.  Since the velocity in
<br>
your frame is so puny, the mass is puny, but it should be
<br>
magnified, not reduced, according to SR!  (Sorry about the
<br>
variable v:  here it means the orbital speed of the planet,
<br>
not your relative velocity to the whole system as usual,
<br>
which should be referred to by another variable, say nu.)
