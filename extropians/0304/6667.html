</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; My notion is that in general, the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanism of mate selection leads to a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; positive feedback mechanisms, whereas survival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; selection more often leads to negative feedback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; mechanisms.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure I can agree with this, spike.  Judging by the fame and fortune
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of women like Marilyn Monroe, and by her marriage to the late baseball star
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Joe DiMaggio, I think it's safe to say that many modern men are inclined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mate with women like her. Is this going to lead to positive feedback from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modern mate selection?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm, Im not sure what to make of your Marilyn Monroe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.  I think you are fearing that in modern times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mentally deficient have a reproductive advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over their mentally adequate counterparts.  Of this I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to agree, however this has little to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival of the species, for humans are currently faaaar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter than optimal for maximum reproduction, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In any case, focus on the notion of evolution having two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinct mechanisms, survival selection and mate selection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the latter of which may be thought of as survival selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the genome level.  I am interested in trying to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations of evolution sophisticated enough to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if survival selection leads to negative feedback loops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereas mate selection leads to positive feedback loops.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this is true, does it matter if a mating is female-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice dominated or male-choice dominated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marilyn's dumbness was an act, by the way.
</em><br>
<p>Have any thoughts on whether unattractive people will tend
<br>
to become more represented proportionally over time?  Mostly
<br>
just prurient interest on my part.
<br>
<p>As for evolution occurring at the present time, one needs
<br>
selection as well as variation, and presently any woman
<br>
appears to be able to have as many children as she wants.
<br>
I haven't concluded anything about this yet, but it doesn't
<br>
sound good.
