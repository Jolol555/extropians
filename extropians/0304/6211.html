Think of how supply - demand works.  If there's more demand for a house, 
<br>
then the price of a house goes up.  Government controls have limited 
<br>
impact here.  If prices are controlled, then substandard housing can be 
<br>
sold until the decline in the quality of the area decreases demand 
<br>
sufficiently.  If prices aren't controlled, then the price will rise 
<br>
until it is satisfied.
<br>
<p>Now consider what happens when something is generating a large number of 
<br>
jobs near a small amount of housing.  Either the price of that housing 
<br>
will rise incredibly, or some means will be found to allow people from a 
<br>
wider area to reach the source of jobs.  This is the simple case of a 
<br>
&quot;company town&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now consider that there are five sources of jobs surrounded by a certain 
<br>
amount of housing, with a time cost to reach the job for each unit of 
<br>
distance.   This requires a complex dynamic programming model.
<br>
<p>Now consider that other things are important:  neighborhood character, 
<br>
schools, libraries, gardening clubs...
<br>
Each person ends up with a different optimum house, but there are a 
<br>
large number of &quot;nearly optimum&quot;.  But if there are a large number of 
<br>
people desiring them, we are back to the &quot;Supply &amp; demand&quot; situation, 
<br>
with the addition of a large cost for finding a good choice.  So the 
<br>
price goes up.  The harder it is to find the &quot;sufficiently good&quot; house, 
<br>
the more the price goes up, because the costlier it is to find a compeitior.
<br>
<p>But the amount of living space around a souce of jobs is limited.  So if 
<br>
the source supplies a very large number of jobs, there will be more 
<br>
demand than can reasonably be satisfied at any price that people (on the 
<br>
average) can pay.  At this point more expensive/less desireable 
<br>
solutions, like apartment houses, began to appear.
<br>
<p>Choices made by governments do have many effects, largely on the quality 
<br>
of life.  But the demand is nearly inelastic, so they don't have much 
<br>
effect on the price/quality.  Until one starts reaching the limits of 
<br>
elasticity.  Signs of that are people without housing, etc.  I haven't 
<br>
been particularly impressed by ANY of the solutions to what to do at 
<br>
that point.  Archologies sound better than most plausible choices, but I 
<br>
really doubt that they would be the idealized structures portrayed by 
<br>
Soleri or Niven&amp;Pournelle.  The feudal government, however, seems all 
<br>
too likely.  I just find it quite unlikely that it would continue 
<br>
benevolent beyond the first generation.  (Still, that might get us to 
<br>
the singularity.)
