<em>&gt; The time has come for chickens to set a bold new goal in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space.  There can be no progress without a goal. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chicken space program, begun so brilliantly with Apollo 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its associated programs, has spent most of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequent twenty years floundering without direction. We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need a central overriding purpose to drive our space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program forward. At this point in history, that focus can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only be the chicken exploration and settlement of Mars.
</em><br>
<p>Imagine the delivery charge to get Kentucky Fried Chicken on Mars...
<br>
<p>Going Further:
<br>
<p>The Iraqi Information Minister:
<br>
&quot;We have no guided chickens! A chicken did not cross the road into
<br>
Kuwait! I do not know why we fired one there. If the spineless American
<br>
imperialist dogs attempt to enter Bagdad, they will commit suicide at
<br>
the hands of our Fedeyeen Saddam Chickens, which are trained to cross
<br>
the road to blow themselves up on American military check points. No,
<br>
those are not Syrian Chickens, though many good muslim chickens from
<br>
around the Chicken World have volunteered to help defend the
<br>
BirdBaathist Party and the Iraqi people against the invaders.&quot;
<br>
<p>Iraqi Science Minister General Mohammad al Saadi:
<br>
&quot;We have no Chickens of Mass Destruction, I know nothing about such
<br>
Chickens, we have not had them for many years. Those were not Chickens
<br>
of Mass Destruction you saw running across the road, they are a
<br>
Hollywood special effects stunt fabricated by the evil Bush regime.
<br>
Such chicken stunts are typical of Americans, and beneath the
<br>
capabilities of a superpower. I spit on the Bush regime and throw my
<br>
shoes at Mr. Bush.&quot;
<br>
<p>Defense Secretary Rumsfeld:
<br>
&quot;There are people who think the chicken crossed the road, there are
<br>
people who think it didn't, and there are people who think the chicken
<br>
is still in the road somewhere, dazzled by the headlights, and there
<br>
are people who just don't know. I am of the latter opinion, I have no
<br>
conviction about the issue until we are able to affirm by observation
<br>
and DNA testing of the chicken to determine if he actually was the same
<br>
chicken that was on the original side.&quot;
<br>
<p>President Bush:
<br>
&quot;The chicken, being chicken, is obviously a cowardly evildoer. His
<br>
running across the road is a sign. A sign of his cowardliness and
<br>
viciousistic disregardation of the liberties of people. People who are
<br>
trying to freely drive down the road to freedom, to be free.&quot;
