Lee Crocker:

<em>&gt;&gt;I'm curious about the attraction of Scuba.

<p><em>&gt;If you like getting up close and personal with the untamed world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ocean rocks.
</em><br>
<p>I spent 34 years living on or next to the Pacific ocean (My family
<br>
lived on a boat in Hawaii during my childhood for part of those
<br>
years). The ocean literally rocked! My recent years being landlocked
<br>
were not easy for me, so I'm happy to be back near a body of water
<br>
(Mediterranean). Even though the Mediterranean cannot be called an
<br>
ocean, I've verified (last weekend!) that there are indeed waves,
<br>
and the sea life in the Mediterranean is fantastically diverse.
<br>
<p>I walked along here last weekend, some parts reminded me of the
<br>
California Coast... but different ..... seagulls, boats, waves,
<br>
1000-year-old abbeys, cliffs, pine trees, villas, focaccia, and
<br>
rosemary:

<p>One can learn about the Ligurian coast  and other sea life  of
<br>
bodies-of-water here, not being in the water: (this aquarium rivals
<br>
that of the Monterey Bay Acquarium.. Europe's best, I think)

<p>The aquarium is presently showing a 3D animation &quot;Krakken&quot; of the
<br>
work of the paleontologist D. Dixon, attempting to answer the
<br>
question: &quot;If one could look at sea life 10 million years in the
<br>
future, what would it look like?&quot;

<p><em>&gt;Although I don't dive, I spend several hours a week (at least on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good weeks!) surfing. That experience suggests to me that divers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might, like surfers, find great appeal simply in spending time in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ocean. It offers great beauty; I enjoy gazing at the waves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sky while I'm waiting for waves. It also offers thrills; only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;short distance from homes and roads, I find myself in a wild place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Last time out, for instance, a dolphin surfaced near my board.

<p>---------------------------------------------------
<br>
a couple of my favorite ocean descriptions of life:
<br>
---------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>&quot;... the Water Genie told Haroun about the Ocean of the Streams of Story,
<br>
and even though he was full of a sense of hopelessness and failure the
<br>
magic of the Ocean began to have an effect on Haroun. He looked into
<br>
the water and saw that it was made up of a thousand thousand thousand
<br>
and one different currents, each one a different color, weaving in and
<br>
out of one another like a liquid tapestry of breathtaking complexity;
<br>
and [the Water Genie] explained that these were the Streams of Story,
<br>
that each colored strand represented and contained a single tale.
<br>
Different parts of Ocean contained different sorts of stories, and as
<br>
all the stories that had ever been told and many that were still in
<br>
the process of being invented could be found here, the Ocean of the
<br>
Streams of Story was in the fact the biggest library in the universe.
<br>
And because the stories were held here in fluid form, they retained
<br>
the ability to change, to become new versions of themselves, to join
<br>
up with other stories and so become yet other stories ...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Salman Rushdie, _Haroun and the Sea of Stories_, (London, 1990),
<br>
pp. 71-72.
<br>
<p>----------------
<br>
<p><p>&quot;I stood once in midstream, balanced on a rock. A scarlet leaf fluttered,
<br>
spiraled down. I watched it, became a wind-blown leaf, swayed, fell into
<br>
the water with a giant human splash, then soddenly crawled out, laughing
<br>
uproariously.
<br>
<p>The process of daily living is often intense and whimsical. The joy of it,
<br>
and the compassion, we can share, but in pain we are ultimately alone.
<br>
The only real antidote is inside. The only real security is not insurance
<br>
or money or a job, not a house and furniture paid for, or a retirement fund,
<br>
and never is it another person. It is the skill and humor and courage
<br>
within, the ability to build your own fires and find your own peace.
<br>
<p>On a solo trip you may discover these, or try to build them, and life
<br>
becomes simple and deeply satisfying. The confidence and strength remain
<br>
and are brought back and applied to the rest of your life.&quot;  &quot;
