</em><br>
<p>Watch out because many of the low carb specialty products have hidden 
<br>
carbs. They are using a loophole in labeling requirements whereby &quot;sugar 
<br>
alcohols&quot; do not have to be counted as carbs. Beware of maltitol, etc.
<br>
In many people this can trigger an insulin response... see below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bad news is that I haven't felt that good.  After about two days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I started getting headaches and feeling an upset stomach, with not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much appetite.  This is supposedly because ketosis is kicking in as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the body has used up its store of carbs and now has to digest fat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The book said this would go away and I would feel full of energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the headaches have gone away but I don't have that much energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My workouts are not quite as hard.  Generally I feel somewhat listless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I'm slow to warm up, although once I get going I can work at pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much the same level as before.  The one positive difference is that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literally feel light on my feet.  The rapid weight loss is noticeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the soles of my feet as I walk, they feel the lessened pressure.
</em><br>
<p>Carefully note the times of day that you feel the symptoms. Do they come 
<br>
within a certain timeperiod after a meal? If your previous diet was 
<br>
heavily carby, your body may be used to producing large amounts of 
<br>
insulin, and it may hypothetically be overreacting to your new meals and 
<br>
causing low blood sugar. Something to ponder at least... and it will be 
<br>
interesting to see if your body adapts better over time. When you do eat 
<br>
carbs, try not to hit &quot;your limit&quot; all in one meal. The goal should be 
<br>
to prevent any serious insulin spikes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's possible that if I increase my carbs somewhat I'll start to feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more energetic.  Atkins recommends doing a very low carb diet, less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 grams per day, for the first two weeks, then gradually increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the carbs and seeing how your weight loss goes.  My main concern is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first triathlon, but that isn't until August.  I need to be at full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy by then.  Hopefully I will be able to do that by increasing carbs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without falling back into my old eating habits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Are you eating enough fat? If you eat a low-carb, low-fat diet, then you 
<br>
are just going to get too much protein, some of which will just get 
<br>
converted into glucose. Not only will this potentially slow weight loss, 
<br>
but it isn't going to help your insulin situation either. I have read 
<br>
some studies lately that say for endurance events it is better to train 
<br>
on a high fat diet since this may improve your body's ability to burn 
<br>
fat during the race for energy. Perhaps your cells are still just too 
<br>
used to not having to burn fat for energy? They literally may have to 
<br>
add on some more mitochondria... takes time. Another benefit is that 
<br>
your cells will likely increase their insulin sensitivity the longer you 
<br>
keep to a low-carb high-fat diet... which also I believe has been show 
<br>
as a major goal for athletes to strive for. Then just a couple days 
<br>
before the race also do some carb loading for an extra little kick to 
<br>
help with any really high exertion periods.
