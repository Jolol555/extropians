Subject: Re: Climate:Cool&amp;Warm
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; ...rising sealevel isn't the acute problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; It's rather the threat of much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; frequent extreme weather events (100 year storms)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; which can cause massive floods, especially if combined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; with something like a high tide, backing up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; of the Rhine and Maas.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Not a lot anyone can do to prevent this though. Florida real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; estate doesn't look like a good bet to me if you look back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just 80 years to the weather it experienced in the 1920s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; when it had a series of huge hurricanes.  Not so many condos
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and hotels back then.
</em><br>
<p>I vaguely remember reading an article or 2 on this subject from a
<br>
libertarian oriented magazine that made the additional point that most
<br>
building in coastal regions subject to storm damage used to be either light
<br>
structures meant to be replaced if swept away or damaged or reinforced
<br>
buildings meant to survive.
<br>
<p>With the advent of subsidized flood insurance, people could get loans for
<br>
building a lot more regular housing in flood prone areas.
<br>
<p>I'm all for voluntary charities helping the victims of disasters.
<br>
But government subsidy of flood insurance encourages people to build in
<br>
flood prone areas.
<br>
<p>I would favor letting people build on their shorefront property, but not in
<br>
favor of subsidizing their flood insurance. Without subsidized insurance, I
<br>
don't think as many people would get loans to build standard housing in
<br>
areas likely to be damaged by coastal storms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just get the government to declare it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disaster area, and the owners don't really run any risk.
</em><br>
<p>This was said in jest, I think.
<br>
Shielding people from the consequences of their actions is frequently
<br>
counterproductive.
<br>
<p>It seems so bogus to tax us all so some can build right in flood prone
<br>
areas. Then the inevitable 100 year storm comes every 5 years and they just
<br>
rebuild because they are covered by insurance. Even a one time buyout or
<br>
other arrangement to phase out the flood subsidy would be preferred, IMHO.
<br>
<p>Otherwise many people argue that since they are subsidizing the insurance,
<br>
the public should have cheap beach access, development should be nil or
<br>
managed by the gov, or other erosion of private property rights.
