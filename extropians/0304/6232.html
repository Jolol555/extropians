I have noticed on the list that anybody who critisizes american foreign policy is immediately branded anti American, I think people from the states must realize that America like many other countries ocassionally make a foreign policy clanger. I notice that Micheal  Dickey says that there are people more in the know than I am that Iraq was a threat to the states,well the war is almost over and up to yet no WMD have been found and before the war started there were several other countries that investigated what threat Iraq posed and they came to the conclusion that Iraq was no international threat. I think after the first Gulf  war Iraq was so humbled  that the Saddam regime  kept a low international profile because of the fear of the war that has just occured.

<p>Ron h says that america reacted because there was reasonable proof that USA was threatened, There has never been reasonable proof that Iraq was a threat to the states,sometime Ron h, s   blind patriotism is beyond belief.Regards Brian Booth

Brian Booth says that america shouldnt react because there was no reasonable proof that the USA was threatened.  There has always been reasonable proof that Iraq was a threat to the states.  Sometimes Brian Booth's blind anti-americanism is beyond belief.  
<br>
Brian, I hope this post illustrates the futility of your post.  Many people consider thier to be a significant deal of evidence showing that Iraq is a threat to *the people* of the United States.  Many of those people qualified to make those decisions are also privy to a lot more information than you are.  But even so, unless you refute the facts that the conclusion stems from, then your comments serve to do nothing except preach to the choir. 
<br>
Regards, 
<br>
Michael Dickey
