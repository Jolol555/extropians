<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Far more than in the past, the current Arab conflict is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; The most dramatic losers so far:... and CNN.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Winners: FoxNews, who got it pretty much right.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What exactly are you talking about? Harvey Newstrom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am referring to the admission by the head of CNN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the news agency suppressed negative information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Saddam for years in exchange for access.  That
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Site?  I am wondering why the head would admit this. The 
<br>
possibilities that come to mind are:
<br>
<p>1) it is true and CNN isbeing press to the wall with proof this 
<br>
was so by some party;
<br>
2) it is true and the head is stupid;
<br>
3) it is false but CNN was well persuaded to claim so.
<br>
<p>If (1), then who would be interested in proving such a thing? 
<br>
Surely not the administration as CNN has been a good and 
<br>
obedient news service to many administrations.  So who?
<br>
<p>I would doubt (2) as I would not expect the head to have arrived 
<br>
at that position out of stupidity.
<br>
<p>On (3) I am not sure what is to be gained by this unless it is a 
<br>
retrofitting of history as recorded by media to support a darker 
<br>
picture than that history does support.
<br>
<p>On the balance I am leaning toward (3) as most probable.
