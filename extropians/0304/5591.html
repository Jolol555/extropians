<p><em>&gt; Points I'd make: the influence of the US is larger than the actions of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government.  I'd say the major part of any American influence toward democracy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is simply from existing, and from saturating the world with our popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, and being so big that everyone has to pay attention to us.  When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have arrested people in other countries screeching for their Miranda rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know we've done something good.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's a good point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you look at government action it's much less rosy.  Sure, we're better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the Soviet Union.  That doesn't take much.  (And for the record, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviet bloc seemed to have better education than we do.)  We've also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overthrown elected governments, propped up dictators, trained death squads,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and turned a blind eye to abuses by our allies.
</em><br>
<p>The point needs to be made over and over that the pre-1989
<br>
world was a LOT DIFFERENT than now.  The West was fighting
<br>
for its life against the Soviet play for world domination.
<br>
They devoted 14% of their GNP to military uses, but would
<br>
have devoted much more than that if they'd been capable of it.
<br>
<p>The choice, as Max Plumm has eloquently explained, was never
<br>
between &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;tyranny&quot; in a developing country,
<br>
but between &quot;pro-U.S. authoritarianism&quot; and &quot;pro-Soviet
<br>
totalitarianism&quot; in those places.  It's still an open
<br>
question even today whether democracy is at all possible
<br>
in Iraq.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The freedoms that each and every human enjoys on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; planet (those fortunate enough to enjoy some) can all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be attributed to some degree to the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They can also be attributed to some degree to Great Britain which spawned us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to France which spread Revolutionary values throughout Europe.
</em><br>
<p>This is also true, and does need to be acknowledged.  But
<br>
speaking of the last century alone, as uncomfortable as it
<br>
may be for some to acknowledge, the aforementioned role of
<br>
the U.S. was exceedingly beneficial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;power corrupts&quot; in the usual formulation.
</em><br>
<p>Let's suppose that the neo-cons get their way in the next
<br>
few U.S. elections, and that after Iraq, other anti-Western
<br>
tyrannical regimes are also subjugated.  Moreover, along
<br>
with the worst fears of many, let's suppose that American
<br>
hegemony in the world continues to grow.  What is the 
<br>
probability in this case that the corruption of which you
<br>
speak will develop?
<br>
<p>Will it be different from 1945?  It is not thought that
<br>
the U.S., in most areas of the world the single superpower,
<br>
really got out of control then.  Frankly, unless there is a
<br>
big change in the nature of the American people, I can't see
<br>
how the United States will become aggressive or imperial any
<br>
time soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Democracy and freedom are quite extropic, and thus the United States has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; done more to spread EXTROPIAN ideals than any other nation in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is not nationalism or blind patriotism, it is a statement of fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an observation based in reality.  To assert otherwise is intellectually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dishonest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know, if we were sufficiently bigger than anyone else, we could have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more to spread extropian ideals and more to inhibit them than anyone else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a net effect of spreading but a real inhibitory effect as well.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, then it remains to be spelled out by anyone up to the
<br>
challenge:  in what ways has U.S. economic and military
<br>
hegemony during the last *fifteen* years resulted in anti-
<br>
extropian tendencies?
