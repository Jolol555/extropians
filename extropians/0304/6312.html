I think Nick Bostrom found this small article on the Saturday April 12 NY 
<br>
Times science section, and sent it to the Everything List. I shall provide a 
<br>
URL for those, so inclined.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/12DAVI.html?pagewanted=2">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/12DAVI.html?pagewanted=2</a>
<br>
<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;At the same time, the multiverse theory also explains too much. Appealing 
<br>
to everything in general to explain something in particular is really no 
<br>
explanation at all. To a scientist, it is just as unsatisfying as simply 
<br>
declaring, &quot;God made it that way!&quot;
<br>
<p>Problems also crop up in the small print. Among the myriad universes similar 
<br>
to ours will be some in which technological civilizations advance to the 
<br>
point of being able to simulate consciousness. Eventually, entire virtual 
<br>
worlds will be created inside computers, their conscious inhabitants unaware 
<br>
that they are the simulated products of somebody else's technology. For every 
<br>
original world, there will be a stupendous number of available virtual worlds 
<br>
— some of which would even include machines simulating virtual worlds of 
<br>
their own, and so on ad infinitum.
<br>
<p>Taking the multiverse theory at face value, therefore, means accepting that 
<br>
virtual worlds are more numerous than &quot;real&quot; ones. There is no reason to 
<br>
expect our world — the one in which you are reading this right now — to be 
<br>
real as opposed to a simulation. And the simulated inhabitants of a virtual 
<br>
world stand in the same relationship to the simulating system as human beings 
<br>
stand in relation to the traditional Creator.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Comment: Hmmm. This sounds like a job for Jurgen Schmidhuber!
