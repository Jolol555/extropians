Those are social gains, I admit.  But the costs have been tremendous.

My wife is a music teacher, and she reports that the ability of students 
<br>
to learn is quite strongly related to whether or not the mother is 
<br>
working (as other than a mother).  Women who choose to be childless have 
<br>
benefited a lot, and those who needed to escape an abusive 
<br>
relationship.  Otherwise, I'm not at all sure.

<p><em>&gt;Krugman traces a lot of socioeconomic relative decline to falling productivity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth rates.  Productivity grew at about 3% in the fifties and sixties, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1% since then.  I think the message was that Ricardo's Iron Law of Wages, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some similar analysis by Marx, were perfectly valid in the static equilibrium.
</em><br>

I think it has more to do with the changing distribution of wealth.  It 
<br>
seems to me that the proportion of the country's wealth controlled by 
<br>
the top 1% of the population (in wealth) has more than doubled.  And the 
<br>
same, to a lesser degree, for the top 10%.  But I must admit I don't 
<br>
know anywhere to find reliable measures for this.
