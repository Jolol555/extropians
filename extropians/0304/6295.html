Brendan Coffey:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've been reading extropians for about... 2yr?  Something like that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here goes my first post...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm kind of alarmed at how I see figures of US foreign military aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being factually confused and contextually misrepresented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From <a href="http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/aid_db.htm">http://www.fas.org/asmp/profiles/aid_db.htm</a> :
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FMF Budget Request FY 2001:  Total budget request:  $3.54 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Budget request for Israel: $1.98 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Budget request for Egypt: $1.3 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $1.3B is not a &quot;tie&quot; with $1.98B.  That's a 52.3% difference.
</em><br>
<p>Well Brendan, thanks for the Math lesson.  I am fully aware that 1.9 and
<br>
1.3B are not a 'tie' however, my first suggestion of 12 billion was quite
<br>
off, and the difference between 1.9 and 1.3 billion compared to 12 billion
<br>
is a insignificant enough as to be considered a 'tie' for the context of the
<br>
discussion.  But we all welcome further information on this list, so thanks
<br>
for spending more googling time digging up more accurate figures than I and
<br>
being kind enough to relay them to us.  However, I do not think your insult
<br>
disguised as a nitpick was neccessary.  But thats just my 2c.
<br>
<p>The US's
<br>
<em>&gt; aid to Israel in 2003 will be $2.1B.  And $12B is over 3x the US'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total foreign military aid allocation.  Damien is conflating total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign aid figures with foreign military aid figures.
</em><br>
<p>Originaly I was referring to Egypts non-military aide, but I did not relay
<br>
as much as I did not, at the time, have the time to dig up the information.
<br>
So are you agreeing than the Egypt is the single biggest reciepient of
<br>
non-military aide?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's cute that people think this isn't about oil, economy and empire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Its cute that people think this IS about oil, economy, and empire.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are correct, it appears I was off by a factor of ten, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Egypt getting around 1.2 billion, which about ties it with Isreal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My apologies, still waiting for my nueral upgrades, momentary lapses of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason should be reduced then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
