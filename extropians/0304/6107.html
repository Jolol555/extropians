<p><em>&gt; &gt; (Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=RE:%20Help%20with%20a%20Minimum%20Wage%20Model">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Are you going to address housing and the other implied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessities or just harp on your understanding of food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abundances (but not necessarily food prices).  If I have no home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or cooking facilities the types of food I can buy are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; severely limited and per unit of nutrition much more expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Are you going to attempt to say that the cost of living in say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1970 dollars has not risen and risen dramatically in the last 32
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If he doesn't, I will. Life is much better and cheaper than it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was in 1970, by the only measure that matters: amount of labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for goods comsumed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, it is better today than it has been at *any* time in the past
<br>
throughout human history.  Everyone is living longer, fuller, healthier
<br>
lives with more free time today than at any point throughout human history.
<br>
I am sure you know this, but I think it is a point not emphasized enough
<br>
today as we are overun by doom and gloom naysayers in our culture of fear.
<br>
<p>Take my favorate example, for instance, farming.  In 1650 some 98% of the
<br>
worlds entire population farm, making just enough food for themselves.  They
<br>
worked long, back breaking days laboring in the fields from sunrise to
<br>
sunset.  There was no free time for art, poetry, music, science, or
<br>
progress, let alone any effort to bring about a singularity, you spent your
<br>
entire existence toiling away just to stay alive, and died around 35 - 40
<br>
years old.  By 1850, it was some 80% of the population farmed, by 1910, with
<br>
the advent of nitrogen fertilizers and the recognition of the value of
<br>
mechnization, rapid changes took place.  In that year, probably som 70% of
<br>
people farmed, but by 1950 it was more like 30%.  Today fewer than 2% of the
<br>
entire world farms, and we produce more food at less cost than ever before.
<br>
Which means through technology, today your average farmer does the work of
<br>
some 100+ farmers of a century ago.  Amazing.  And now that we dont have to
<br>
toil away in fields all day, we have time for hobbies, for nurturing
<br>
interests in things that make life better, longer, and more enjoyable.
<br>
'Retirement' did not even exist 60 years ago.  We now spend more time
<br>
learning and in retirement than we do working, at least in the post
<br>
industrialized west, and current trends show this will eventually spread to
<br>
all people.
