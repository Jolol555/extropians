<em>&gt; &gt;For millions of years you've done fine on a diet of only lean meats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fish, fowl, eggs, vegetables, fruits and nuts. This is the diet on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which you were raised and to which you are genetically adapted. Then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;overnight, along come the dairy and grain farmers. You awaken one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;morning to a Neolithic world in which people are trying to foist dairy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and agricultural products on you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Would it not be unreasonable to ask those dairy and grain farmers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;first prove their case that these new-fangled foods are good for human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;health and longevity? i.e, would it not be unreasonable to take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;position that the diet you've followed for millions of years is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;default diet hypothesis in need of being disproved?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For millions of years you've done fine on a diet of &quot;things that taste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good&quot;, following the decision rule of, if two foods are available,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferring to eat the one that tastes the best.  Suddenly you awaken one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning to find paleodiet theorists claiming that this evolved instinctive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple rule no longer works and must instead be replaced with a much more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex and conscious decision process.  Would it not be unreasonable to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask these paleodiet theorists to first prove their case that this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new-fangled decision rule is good for human health and longevity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paleodiet theory is one of exactly *two* accidental hits I can think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the precautionary principle.  In all other cases I know of, &quot;the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way is the good way&quot; has rarely been a good heuristic once matters get to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of there being an argument at all.
</em><br>
<p>It's worse than that--even his imaginary story isn't really helpful.
<br>
The fact is, Mr. Hugh M. Species did not do &quot;just fine&quot; on fish, fowl,
<br>
etc. In fact, he was probably near starvation most of the time, and
<br>
just managed to reproduce once or twice before dying in his twenties
<br>
of disease or injury. That started to change with agriculture. One
<br>
can certainly argue that eliminating starvation alone is the only cause
<br>
of that benefit, and that nutrition actually decreased, but that has
<br>
to be shown rather than assumed. It is true that it was statistically
<br>
unlikely for him to have acquired adaptations to those agricultural
<br>
products that were unlike his former foods during that time, and he
<br>
certainly did acquire adaptations to the foods that were available to
<br>
him (and by accident those like them), so that certainly suggests that
<br>
learning what those foods were is a worthwhile thing to investigate.
<br>
But as you say, the argument is no less weak for happening to support
<br>
a good conclusion.
