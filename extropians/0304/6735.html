<em>&gt; This comment is interesting to me for two reasons: first, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would disagree adamantly with Diamond if he really suggests 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in his books that the hunting of animals to extinction was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;destructive tendency&quot; of hungry paleolithic peoples who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't know better, and second because I'm inclined to agree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Daniel Quinn who believes civilized societies have often 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tended to be more destructive than prehistoric societies. 
</em><br>
<p>Diamond's thinking on this topic is quite consistent with the vast
<br>
majority of anthropological data.  Quinn's thinking sounds like an
<br>
echo of the &quot;noble savage&quot; and &quot;peaceful hunter-gatherer&quot; myths that
<br>
were promulgated a few decades ago but are now discredited.
<br>
<p>Animals in the wild will hunt their prey to extinction if conditions
<br>
allow.  Primitive humans were no different.  Only with the rise of
<br>
agriculture did the notion of preserving animal lines for future food
<br>
arise.
<br>
<p>For corroborating data see Stephen Pinker's _The Blank Slate_ or look
<br>
up the work of Donald Brown on &quot;Human Universals&quot;.  Also consider
<br>
reading Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ - it presents a truly vast
<br>
amount of evidence for Diamond's positions, so much so that I found
<br>
myself saying &quot;enough!  I believe you now!&quot; many times while reading
<br>
the book.
