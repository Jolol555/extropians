<p>It isn't really clear.  The virus seems to have a &quot;now you see it, now
<br>
you don't&quot; aspect to it.
<br>
<p>See: Virus Proves Baffling, Turning Up in Only 40% of a Lab's Test Cases
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/science/24INFE.html?pagewanted=print">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/science/24INFE.html?pagewanted=print</a>
<br>
<p>There are a number of possibilities:
<br>
1) It is mutating over time and the normal tests they use to identify
<br>
it (which I presume are Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify
<br>
the genome will not work every time) -- this will put it in a class
<br>
like HIV (but possibly spread through air droplets or fecal matter).
<br>
<p>2) That it isn't really caused by a coronavirus at all and they haven't
<br>
really identified the causitive agent yet.
<br>
<p>3) That some people have a natural immunity to it (since some show
<br>
infections but no symptoms).
<br>
<p>In the short term one has to do what is already being done.  Wear masks
<br>
where appropriate, follow quarantine rules, etc.
<br>
<p>Now, on the TV this morning I heard comments to the effect that most of
<br>
the people who have died are either elderly or otherwise immunocompromised.
<br>
This only makes sense and implies that most people do not really need
<br>
to be fearful (as Anders points out).
<br>
<p>In the short term the answer is to take reasonable precautions to avoid
<br>
it.  In the intermediate term the answer is to push the science a little
<br>
bit harder.  In the long term the answer is to develop a vaccine and
<br>
rapidly provide it to health care workers in SARS wards, general hospital
<br>
workers, the families and co-workers of SARS patients, and move outward
<br>
from there.
<br>
<p>Its always important to keep in mind influenza kills (to my best very
<br>
rough guess) around 600,000 people a year [1] while SARS if it continues
<br>
at its present rate will only kill perhaps 500 people this year.
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>1. Assuming influenza kills ~30,000 people/yr in the U.S. and extrapolating
<br>
to the world population.  The number of 600,000 may be somewhat lower
<br>
because in many countries of the world a different diseases/conditions
<br>
may kill you before you become old enough (and immunocompromized enough)
<br>
that influenza can kill you.
