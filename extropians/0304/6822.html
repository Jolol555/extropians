<p><em>&gt; No, that *would* be just playing burden-of-proof

</em><br>
<em>&gt; any evidence 
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, that is NOT my &quot;sole justification.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Apparently I haven't made myself clear. I wonder how
<br>
many more times I will need to repeat myself on this
<br>
particular point. I've done so at least three times
<br>
here already with Harvey and others, in this thread
<br>
and in other diet-related threads populated by the
<br>
same people.
<br>
<p>The evidence is clear that paleolithic foods are more
<br>
nutrient-dense and healthier than non-paleolithic
<br>
foods, and this evidence comes not only from
<br>
archaeology but also from entirely outside of
<br>
paleodiet theory, directly from nutritional science
<br>
itself. As I wrote to Harvey, I shouldn't need to
<br>
remind anyone interested in nutritional science that
<br>
the literature is replete with evidence that
<br>
paleolithic foods are among the healthiest foods
<br>
available. Who with any basic knowledge of nutrition
<br>
can argue that fish, lean meats and poultry, fruits,
<br>
and vegetables are not among the healthiest and most
<br>
nutrient-dense foods in existence? And that foods like
<br>
ice cream, pizza, candy, milk-shakes, bread, and
<br>
pancakes have by comparison very little food value?
<br>
These basic ideas should not really be a matter for
<br>
debate here, I would think.
<br>
<p>I was agreeing with your *entire* paragraph at the top
<br>
<p>of this post, including and especially your words
<br>
&quot;especially because there are now enough 
<br>
specific cases of modern diets being detrimental 
<br>
because of violating ancestral invariants that I 
<br>
would, indeed, tend to take as the *new* working 
<br>
assumption that the ancestral diet is better until 
<br>
proven otherwise.&quot;
<br>
<p>What I'm trying to convey here is this: when you say
<br>
as you did above that you would... 
<br>
<p>&quot;tend to take as the *new* working assumption that the
<br>
ancestral diet is better until proven  otherwise&quot; 
<br>
<p>...you are saying precisely what I am also saying.
<br>
<p>I restate the exact same idea in statistical research
<br>
terms:
<br>
<p>&quot;I tend to think paleodiet theory is the null
<br>
hypothesis which needs be disproved by some competing
<br>
hypothesis, as opposed to being one of those competing
<br>
hypotheses.&quot; 
<br>
<p>As for so-called &quot;Burden of proof table tennis,&quot; I
<br>
really don't see what the problem is. Burden of proof
<br>
is not some kind of dreaded term to be avoided. It is
<br>
an emotionally neutral idea. It does not alone imply
<br>
that either side is right or wrong. It's merely an
<br>
artifact of statistical research. For scientific
<br>
progress to take place, someone must compare and
<br>
discredit the null hypothesis by providing proof that
<br>
a competing hypothesis better explains the empirical
<br>
data. 
<br>
<p>In terms of paleodiet theory testing, the experimental
<br>
setup would look like this:
<br>
<p>Definition: &quot;'Optimal Diet' causes a, b and c.&quot; (where
<br>
a, b and c are some measurable parameters of good
<br>
health and longevity agreeable to both camps.)
<br>
<p>The Null Hypothesis:
<br>
&quot;The Optimal Diet is Paleolithic.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Competing Hypothesis:
<br>
The Optimal Diet is paleolithic except with respect to
<br>
adding [insert non-paleo item(s) here] and/or removing
<br>
[insert paleo item(s) here].
<br>
<p>If a test on humans showed that the health parameters
<br>
associated with the competing hypothesis were
<br>
healthier than those from the null hypothesis, with
<br>
statistical significance &gt; 95%, then we would reject
<br>
the null hypothesis and accept the competing
<br>
hypothesis. 
<br>
<p>This has already been done successfully, for example,
<br>
with respect to adding non-paleo antibiotics. The
<br>
tests were not directly against the paleodiet but few
<br>
would dispute that they pertain also to the paleodiet.
