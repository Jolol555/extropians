<p>
Caffeine upregulates cAMP, which may help prevent apoptosis by, if I
<br>
remember correctly, upregulating Brain Derived Growth Factor (BDGF).
<br>
Upregulation of cAMP is thought to be part of the mechanism by which
<br>
caffeine and most antidepressants lead to increased volume of the
<br>
hippocampus.
<br>
<p>As to why caffeine might not work alone: caffeine also has a
<br>
vasoconstrictive effect which in ischemic stroke would be very undesirable,
<br>
but this effect might be offset by the vasodilator and anti-platelet
<br>
aggregation effects of ethanol. 
<br>
<p>Epidemiological studies suggest very strongly that moderate alcohol
<br>
consumption (one or two drinks per day) increases life-expectancy in humans.
<br>
<p><p>Ethanol is also thought to have some mild antioxidant properties taken
<br>
alone, which may or may not contribute to increased life-expectancy. 
<br>
<p>Among other things ethanol acts as an antagonist at certain subtypes of the
<br>
NMDA receptor, which would in theory inhibit the massive excitotoxic damage
<br>
that normally occurs in the hours following ischemic stroke.
<br>
<p>Just my speculations.
<br>
<p>Reminds me: I attended traffic school a few weeks ago to take care of a
<br>
speeding ticket. The retired state trooper told us that drinking coffee
<br>
before driving drunk only makes one into a wide-awake drunk-driver. Perhaps
<br>
I'll write to inform him that it may also offer protection against the
<br>
damage caused by ischemic stroke. :)
