<em>&gt; &gt; However, I still have a few problems with the Paleo diet theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1.  Why are beans left out?  I don't buy the part about not being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to soak them.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2.  Why are grains left out?  Same thing.  Everyone seems to admit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that grains grew wild all over the place.
</em><br>
<p>The simple explaination is that grains and beans just didn't grow wild
<br>
all over the place as we imagine. The bean and grain species we are
<br>
used to are the result of several thousand years of directed evolution,
<br>
breeding specifically for large fruit size and quantity. Their
<br>
paleolithic ancestors just didn't produce that much fruit and no fruit
<br>
of the size we are used to. Because of this, paleolithic people didn't
<br>
invest much time into gathering these specifically because the energy
<br>
payback was so meager.
<br>
It was only when some individuals got the bright idea of selecting
<br>
grains from the most fruitful plants to grow in isolation that the long
<br>
process of domestication occured. The development of this technology
<br>
spelled the end of the paleolithic era.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Speaking of not having bowls, this Paleo Diet seems to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that everything needs to be cooked using an open flame.  Modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge tells us that this is the worst way to cook foods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially meats.  
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily. Pit cooking techniques are paleolithic in nature and
<br>
do not result in the charring that generates the carcinogenic compounds
<br>
moderns are so afraid of. Ever been to a new England clam bake or
<br>
Hawaiian pig roast? That is non-carcinogenic paleolithic cooking.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4.  I agree that humans are naturally omnivores, eating meat and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vegetables. But the meat-eating seems a bit exaggerated. It is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obvious or proven that the ancient ancestors ate huge amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meat every day.  They probably had meat a few times per week, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foraged for nuts, berries, and vegetables the rest of the time. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Their diet was mostly vegetarian every day, with boosts of meat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occasionally. 
</em><br>
<p>I beg to differ. Anthropologists have developed evidence that
<br>
neanderthals ate a 90% meat diet, where cro-mags ate about 60% meat,
<br>
depending on habitat.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The studies of hunter-gather cultures I've seen suggest that HG
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumed as much as 60% or more of their calories from animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they did not eat animals every day. Keep in mind that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calories from fats and organs as well as from muscles. A single wooly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammoth could feed a small tribe for several weeks.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and paleolith proponents are 'down on vegetarianism', as Harvey
<br>
says, specifically for energy and power reasons. Look at any
<br>
vegetarian. Most are waif thin. Only the most disciplined are able to
<br>
maintain any sort of significant muscle mass. Imagine such individuals
<br>
trying to take on a sabre tooth or cave bear, trying to track a woolly
<br>
mammoth or red deer for days, then having the energy to haul the kill
<br>
by hand over miles of rough and hostile terrain, fighting off
<br>
scavenging packs of hyenas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5.  Speaking of vegetarianism, most of the complaints against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vegetarianism have nothing to do with modern day.  First of all, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone isn't a total vegan, meaning they also eat milk, dairy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eggs, then they are not missing out on all the animal-only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nutrients. Plus, we have supplements today. Any modern person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taking a well rounded supplement won't have any of the deficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems. Plus, we can mass produce food in ways never available 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before.  
</em><br>
<p>Outside of lactose intolerance being an indicator that dairy was not a
<br>
common paleolithic food group. With modern supplements, yes, you can
<br>
make up for shortfalls in the vegan diet that way, but what is the real
<br>
uptake? I was under the impression that the uptake of supplements was
<br>
rather poor. It is also kinda dishonest, much like my article on how
<br>
the Nearings cheated on their &quot;Good Life&quot; with inherited wealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Maybe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ancients couldn't mass produce tofu enough for their diet, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corner grocery store can.  Most of the anti-vegetarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stuff I read here is aimed at theoretical diets that don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exist any more, or aimed at pseudo-scientific claims that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have nothing to do with a life-extensionist diet that avoids meat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is basically a nutritional science based approach to &quot;designer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diets,&quot; and while I don't reject nutrition science out of hand, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I'm a LEF member and a customer), I also believe nutrition science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is incomplete and fraught with contradiction. 
</em><br>
<p>But that isn't the point, either. The point of living a paleolithic
<br>
diet is to live healthfully without modern interventionist techniques
<br>
like supplements, caloric restriction, body building and aerobic
<br>
training. It naturally avoids foods which the human animal did not
<br>
evolve to eat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 6.  I agree totally with the part about ancient lean meats being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much healthier than the fatty meats we produce today. That is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; part of the reason I am vegetarian, and part of the reason I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't eat a lot of meat to duplicate the Paleo diet. Modern meat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is dangerous, fatty stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. I have a list of about 20 sources of natural range-fed and wild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game meats and eggs that ship by mail-order. Let me know if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like it. Range-fed and wild game meat is much leaner, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper balances of important fats like omega-3 and 6, whereas farm-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fed beef is overly fat and overly rich in omega-6 from the high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omega-6 non-paleo corn upon which it is raised.
</em><br>
<p>Watch out. I have found that many of the so-called 'range fed' meats
<br>
are stall fattened with corn for several months prior to slaughter.
<br>
While I don't mind eating these once in a while, if I cannot obtain
<br>
truly wild meat, I will eat naturally lean meat like fish, turkey,
<br>
ostrich, emu, buffalo, etc.
