<em>&gt; I don't understand how you can say that breads and pasta hold up decently!
</em><br>
<p>Because I look at the labels and do the math and get decent numbers.  Some
<br>
multi-grain bread here would give 80g of protein and 160% of fiber, plus 100%
<br>
of iron and lots of various B-vitamins.  Some conventional pasta would give
<br>
70g of protein and 90% of fiber.  Like I said, they're not complete foods, but
<br>
they're not horrible.  Eat a bit less, eat an orange and a carrot, or some
<br>
broccoli, and you're doing pretty well, or better than lots of sugar-fed
<br>
Americans.  Calcium shortage, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Practically any vegetable is more nutrient-dense than any agricultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product. 
</em><br>
<p>Oh, definitely.  But you have to get calories too.  And the link between
<br>
saturated fat and heart disease seems pretty strong, so I'd be careful with
<br>
the meat and fowl.
<br>
<p>And I'm on a budget.  Grains and beans are cheap.  (I miss Trader Joe's and
<br>
whole wheat pasta which wasn't a price ripoff.)
<br>
<p>Look, my main objection is people acting as if grains are empty calories.
<br>
They're not.  Maybe Wonderbread is close to it, but there's more to the world
<br>
of grains than that.  Bleached and refined flour is not all there is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The aborigines you mentioned have learned to grind seeds to make flour,
</em><br>
<p>Not flour, breaking up seed cases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which puts them on the cusp of Neolithic. Before long they will learn to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plant those seeds to provide food for the next season, if they haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already learned to do so, and this will put them squarely into the
</em><br>
<p>They might have been using those stones since before the Neolithic happened
<br>
elsewhere.  And this is Australia; the next season is pretty unreliable and
<br>
the aborigines did fine without planting and anyway the European invasion
<br>
pretty much disrupted everything.
<br>
<p>On the flip side those are unselected grass seeds -- which are, after all,
<br>
simply seeds.  If you want to say large and starch-boosted agricultural
<br>
products are unhealthy I don't think the Australians contradict you.
<br>
<p>The other way of looking at all this is that while it's hard to know exactly
<br>
what the Palaeolithics were eating -- plants don't preserve well, and studies
<br>
can be biased by the hunter or gatherer biases of the researchers -- there's a
<br>
population in the world today which lives longer than everyone, which unlike
<br>
alleged yogurt-eating Caucasus folk is documented thanks to a modern
<br>
bureaucracy.  I speak of the Okinawans, who have more (and more active)
<br>
nonagenarians than anyone, and who eat a lot of rice.  White rice, even.  But
<br>
they also eat lots of fish and vegetables and drink lots of green tea and
<br>
don't eat much land meat or dairy and also seem to avoid stress.  And their
<br>
children go off and live like Westerners and die early, so genetics don't seem
<br>
a likely culprit here.  Or at least so says _The Okinawa Program_, from which
<br>
I conclude having some grains in your diet is not going to kill you.
<br>
<p>I do have to amend the &quot;lots of&quot;s above; apparently another cultural feature
<br>
of old Okinawans was &quot;eating until 80% full&quot;, so there may be a mild
<br>
calorie-restriction component going on here too...
