<p>
This past weekend I was asked the best question I've ever been asked
<br>
about transhumanism. Paraphrasing: what is the difference, if any,
<br>
between transhumanist views of technology and merely rational views of
<br>
the same?
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is not just about technology, of course. But the question
<br>
is a good one even when looked at in broader terms. What is the
<br>
difference, if any, between transhumanist thinking and rational
<br>
thinking?
<br>
<p>My initial take was that this question was a set-up to either get me to
<br>
admit an element of irrationality in transhumanist thinking, or to get
<br>
me to claim that non-transhumanists are irrational. But, barring
<br>
paranoia, I still find it difficult to answer. Is there some leap of
<br>
faith being made by transhumanists that your average person doesn't
<br>
make? 
<br>
<p>Is transhumanism a moral philosophy? That is, does it apply moral
<br>
principles, deduce moral principles, or even recognize moral principles?
<br>
If it is not a moral philosophy, then what is it? Is it a philosophy at
<br>
all? 
<br>
<p>Transhumanism and extropianism *do* seem to have a discernible roster of
<br>
values. These have evolved considerably since I first started reading
<br>
about transhumanism in 1996. Or, more precisely, the descriptions of
<br>
these values have evolved considerably. Of course values such as reason,
<br>
progress, improvement, growth, etc., are not themselves unique to
<br>
transhumanism, but in combination they do describe a unique way of
<br>
thinking about the universe. 
<br>
<p>But does this way of thinking about the universe differ from rational
<br>
thinking about the universe?
<br>
<p>In the end, the best response I could muster to this question was to
<br>
bring it back to the perennial issue of starting points and assumptions.
<br>
If one values rational thinking alone, then perhaps another's
<br>
transhumanist thinking does differ in certain respects. Only very rare
<br>
people can truthfully say they value rational thinking and nothing else.
<br>
When other values are present, one's thinking may very well vary from
<br>
the rational baseline. But this answer doesn't seem good enough to me.
<br>
