</em><br>
<p>It is my impression that the only people with whom the US govts
<br>
reputation is permanently damaged are those who saw it as damaged long
<br>
prior to our involvement in Iraq, and who use such events as 9/11 to
<br>
berate us rather than sympathize, to scold rather than empathize, and
<br>
to obstruct rather than to understand and accept that those who attack
<br>
us are inherently wrong. I frankly don't give a damn whether such
<br>
individuals feel permanently offended at US behavior. We don't need the
<br>
sympathy, empathy, or cooperation of those who are has-been,
<br>
self-marginalized, self-deluded resentment mongers.
<br>
<p>As Churchill's grandson stated recently, &quot;The French have never
<br>
forgiven us for liberating them.&quot; Now I don't think there is any one
<br>
reason. Individuals who resent us have their each individual stories of
<br>
personal misery. Lost grandeur, lost empire, lost respect, whatever the
<br>
reason, they hate us not for what we are or what we do, but how what we
<br>
are and do reflects how they are not now what they once were. They
<br>
blame their own lack of opportunity or potential, caused by the
<br>
calcification and rot of their own cultures, on the fact that so much
<br>
opportunity and potential exists here. It is a zero sum calculus so
<br>
typical of those outside the US, that our eminence must be the cause of
<br>
their decline.
<br>
<p>Whether it is the lost Andalusian past of the romantic Islamic golden
<br>
age (which was far more decadent than the ascetic Wahabists or
<br>
Salafists would like to believe), or the lost memories of various
<br>
european or other empires, be they French, German, Spanish, Russian,
<br>
Chinese, Dutch or Italian, it doesn't really matter. The descendants of
<br>
those who made those nations great once ago have long lived here in the
<br>
US. Cast out by the institutional and bureaucratic barnacles of
<br>
calcified cultures, those who have the blood of creativity, courage,
<br>
and conviction coursing through their veins are who made this country
<br>
great and cast the contrasting sunbeam of truth on the immoral decayed
<br>
and rotting cultural carcasses remaining in their nations of ancestry.
<br>
<p>Claiming to love the American people but dislike our governments
<br>
policies is as dishonest an attitude as to claim to be opposed to the
<br>
war but to support the troops. You can't do both at once, because both
<br>
policy and individual are so intractably joined. While less free
<br>
nations may claim that the policies of their government are not the
<br>
policies of their citizenry, such a claim cannot be made of the US.
<br>
While whole armies recruited by draft and compulsory service cannot be
<br>
charged with guilt of militarism or agreement with the orders of
<br>
leadership cadres, our all volunteer military, from buck private to top
<br>
officer, almost uniformly agrees and supports the need for this war.
<br>
You cannot support these troops if you do not support their support of
<br>
the war, if you are going to be true to your pacifistic principles. 
<br>
<p>I suppose if you are a hypocrite as a regular practice it is possible,
<br>
but that is to be expected. A nation which accuses us of fighting the
<br>
war for oil denies that its own opposition is because of oil, despite
<br>
the existence of contracts proving such. Opposition to ending economic
<br>
sanctions against a nation which no longer is led by the tyrant that
<br>
caused them to be enacted is mere poor sportsmanship and pouting.
<br>
<p>It is rather sick to see France, Germany, and Russia opposed to ending
<br>
the sanctions now that Iraq is free, simply because they don't want the
<br>
people to be able to reconstruct themselves. They want things to appear
<br>
as much as though we are an occupying power as possible. They are
<br>
certainly the Axis of Losers now. I suppose they are trying to promote
<br>
themselves to Axis of Just As Evil status...
