<p><p>Is it a starfish? Is it an orchid? No, it's Superformula.

<br>
<p><p>For centuries scientists have sought to express natural forms in mathematical 
<br>
terms.

<br>
<p><p>One simple equation can generate a vast diversity of natural shapes, a 
<br>
Belgian biologist has discovered. The Superformula, as its creator Johan 
<br>
Gielis has christened it, produces everything from simple triangles and 
<br>
pentagons, to stars, spirals and petals.
<br>
<p>&quot;When I found the formula, all these beautiful shapes came rolling out of my 
<br>
computer,&quot; says Gielis, at University of Nijmegen, Holland. &quot;It seemed too 
<br>
good to be true - I spent two years thinking 'What did I do wrong?' and 'How 
<br>
come no one else has discovered it?'&quot; Having spoken to mathematicians, he 
<br>
reckons that he's found something new.
<br>
<p>The Superformula is a modified version of the equation for a circle<A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nsu/030331/#b1">1</A>. 
<br>
Changing one term in the formula varies the proportions of the shape - moving 
<br>
from a round circle to a long and skinny ellipse. Changing another varies the 
<br>
axes of symmetry - shifting from a circle to triangle, square, pentagon and 
<br>
so on.
<br>
<p>Varying both proportion and symmetry together produces shapes with any number 
<br>
of sides, regular and irregular. It can also produce three-dimensional 
<br>
structures, and non-biological shapes such as snowflakes and crystals. &quot;It's 
<br>
a new way of describing nature,&quot; says Gielis.
<br>
<p>For centuries, scientists have sought to express natural forms - such as the 
<br>
spiral of a sheep's horn, the branching of a tree, or a bee's honeycomb - in 
<br>
mathematical terms.
<br>
<p>&quot;Describing form is one of the more intractable problems in biology,&quot; says 
<br>
botanist Karl Niklas of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Researchers 
<br>
have come up with many ways to describe leaves and shells, for example, but 
<br>
there is little unity: &quot;Things have become cumbersome and idiosyncratic,&quot; he 
<br>
says.
<br>
<p>The Superformula might provide a single, simple framework for analysing and 
<br>
comparing the shapes of life, believes Niklas. &quot;This is an exciting 
<br>
development.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The Superformula produces regular and irregular shapes with any number of 
<br>
sides.

<br>
Gielis has patented his discovery, and is developing computer software based 
<br>
on it. Using one formula to produce shapes will make graphics programs much 
<br>
more efficient, he says. It might also be useful in pattern recognition.
<br>
<p>What's less clear is whether nature uses the formula to generate different 
<br>
shapes. &quot;I'm not convinced this is significant, but it might turn out to be 
<br>
profound if it could be related to how things grow,&quot; says mathematician Ian 
<br>
Stewart of the University of Warwick, UK.
<br>
<p>Other, more complicated, single equations can produce a similar diversity of 
<br>
shapes, says Stewart. He believes that the Superformula is more likely to 
<br>
provide a useful tool than an insight into how life actually works.
<br>
<p>Gielis acknowledges that the formula describes nature's end product, not how 
<br>
it got there, but he hopes that time might prove the Superformula's 
<br>
profundity. &quot;Description always precedes ideas about the real connection 
<br>
between maths and nature,&quot; he says.
