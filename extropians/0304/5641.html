<em>&gt;  &gt; We can say without drawing much objection that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; member of the KKK is &quot;scum&quot; for the reason that White
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Supremacist has been widely discredited by intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; thoughtful people with *valid logical arguments*.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with gts here.  Whether or not saying that
<br>
a member of the KKK &quot;is scum&quot; draws objections or not is
<br>
not the point.  As gts and Harvey have explained, there
<br>
is simply no content to such name calling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I couldn't agree with you more.  Just screaming &quot;Your momma wears army
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boots!&quot; adds nothing to a discussion but if you present valid logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that a certain opinion is idiotic and if you show valid logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; augments that a certain person holds that opinion then it is perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable to make a deduction about that person from the above information.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not even sure that it's possible to prove that some 
<br>
position is &quot;idiotic&quot;.  Perhaps you have an example?
<br>
Well, here's one just in case you don't.  Person A says
<br>
&quot;It logically follows that since Hitler was a vegetarian
<br>
and Hitler was totally evil, vegetarianism is totally
<br>
evil.&quot;  Can we prove that A's opinion is idiotic?
<br>
<p>I don't think that we can come to agree on what the term
<br>
&quot;idiotic&quot; means as an adjective modifying &quot;opinion&quot; beyond
<br>
&quot;we disagree with that opinion&quot;.  We can prove that the
<br>
speaker is committing logical fallacies (he asked for it,
<br>
since he used the word &quot;logically&quot;), and we can maintain
<br>
with great credibility (among sensible people) that he's
<br>
wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; However such statements are not themselves part of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; valid logical argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I couldn't disagree with you more. Saying they are scum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is PART of a valid logical argument, it is the conclusion.
</em><br>
<p>This is very weird.  How is it that how one &quot;should feel&quot;
<br>
is part of an argument?  What if one happens to have no
<br>
feelings, like certain autistic but highly intelligent
<br>
people I know?  Or how could we ever get an expert system
<br>
(that flawlessly evaluates logical arguments) to ever
<br>
agree to such a conclusion?
<br>
<p>Harvey wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an argument [ad hominem or name calling] fails.  It is content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free.  This is not to say that it is rude or politically incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It simply does not give any evidence for the conclusion.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the root reason why ad hominem is invalid evidence.
</em><br>
<p>While completely true, I think that this understates the
<br>
harm done by statements such as &quot;a member of the KKK is
<br>
scum&quot;.  By substituting for good argument, we have a 
<br>
discourse version of Gresham's Law:  bad argument drives
<br>
out good.  Silly statements like that supplant the rightful
<br>
place of effective statements.
<br>
<p>But it's even worse than that!  A statement such as &quot;X
<br>
is idiotic&quot;, or &quot;X is scum&quot; carries a much more sinister
<br>
implication.  The hidden implication is that the speaker
<br>
resorted to such statements because no logical or valid
<br>
arguments were available to the speaker.  And, ugly as it
<br>
is, one possible inference from that is that logical or
<br>
valid arguments against X either don't exist or are
<br>
awkward.  Hence the appeal to emotion and group prejudice.
