In a message dated 4/1/2003 2:56:20 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Greg%20Burch's%20request">samantha@objectent.com</a> quotes: Ron, mine, the Mikes, and many other posters 
<br>
determination to fully have the record of the United States analyzed and the 
<br>
positive (and negative) accomplishments recognized and understood cannot be 
<br>
dismissed out of hand because we happen to be Americans.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Samantha replied, &quot;Such a least is not terribly relevant to 
<br>
whether this particular war is just or not.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;## But of course it is relevant to this debate.  Samantha, I believe 
<br>
you have made our record a part of the debate and part of your reason for 
<br>
disagreeing with the American position and conduct on Iraq.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you did this then we certainly have a right to question your 
<br>
assertion.  If we allow you make serious assertions without any evidence 
<br>
whatever then we have allowed you to beg the question successfully.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course you can refuse to touch &quot;that tarbaby&quot; but never let it be 
<br>
forgotten who created the tarbaby.  You created the tarbaby when you made an 
<br>
assertion which you would neither defend nor accept as your having made a 
<br>
mistake.  You have gone so far as to brag, in my opinion, that you no longer 
<br>
read what I had to say.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate, first you slandered our country in my opinion.  
<br>
Second you refused to defend your position when politely asked to do so.  
<br>
Finally you attempted to figuratively kill the messenger by refusing to 
<br>
listen to my assertions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha, it might surprise you but I really don't enjoy this thread 
<br>
nor most of the threads over what might broadly called the left versus the 
<br>
right.  I have never initiated even one of these threads.  I would much 
<br>
rather listen to the more Extropian threads.  If many of them go over my head 
<br>
forcing me to lurk -- well, I'm catching up fast.  &lt;G&gt;  However I will not 
<br>
sit quietly and listen to my country slandered nor its positions 
<br>
misrepresented.
<br>
Ron h.
