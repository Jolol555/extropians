<em>&gt; I believe we are as perfectly adapted to a paleo diet as a giraffe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is perfectly adapted to eating the leaves from tall trees. In these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threads, however, few people are willing to grant that 4,000,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years of hominid evolution has optimized the human genome for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prehistoric diet.
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense--of course we grant that. We're not stupid. We're just
<br>
not so blindly devoted that we can't also see the /other/ valid
<br>
arguments against the paleo diet, which are just as strong:
<br>
<p>(1) Evolution isn't so slow that the last 10,000 years are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;irrelevant. Indeed, recentness of years trumps mere numbers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, that giraffe spent 3 billion years adapted to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;living in the ocean before the last few million on land.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have been eating starchy tubers and grains for more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;than enough time to acquire adaptations to them, and a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;small subset of us (those of European descent mostly) have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even acquired adaptations to dairy.
<br>
<p>(2) A diet optimized for the goals of our genes isn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;necessarily optimized for /our/ goals. Longevity is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;obvious example: our genes want to optimize our chances of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;surviving long enough to reproduce. We want to optimize
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;useful lifespan. Those are very different things.
<br>
<p>(3) Evolution may be smarter than we are, but even we can come
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;up with original ideas now and then that are useful and which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evolution missed. New foods are certainly among those, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;there's no legitimate reason to avoid individual new foods for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;which there is ample evidence of nutritional benefit just
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;because they don't happen to fit into an overall theory.
<br>
<p>(4) No matter how compelling the theory is, the proof is in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;results, not theory. Paleodiet theory just hasn't yet been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subjected to the kinds of long-term controlled studies that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;we'd like to see.
