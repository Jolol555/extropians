<p>
It seems to me that this discussion is wandering off into freedom and 
<br>
coercion byways. Remember this technology is from Microsoft, after all. 
<br>
You have to assume the MS tunnel vision outlook when evaluating it.
<br>
MS is doing this because they plan that it will benefit MS.
<br>
<p>Now, exactly how will it benefit MS?
<br>
<p>Microsoft promotes Palladium as a boon to user privacy, security, and a 
<br>
stopper of worms and viruses. Quote - &quot;Our technology allows content 
<br>
providers, enterprises and consumers to control what others can do with 
<br>
their digital information, such as documents, music, video, ebooks, and 
<br>
software.&quot;
<br>
You can be sure the main &quot;digital rights&quot; Palladium protects will be 
<br>
Microsoft's. You will find it impossible to run Microsoft software on 
<br>
any computer other than the one to which it was originally registered.
<br>
<p>Palladium requires computers to have a special chip, which both Intel 
<br>
and AMD have already agreed to incorporate. &quot;Protected content&quot; will not 
<br>
run on a computer lacking the chip, or with the Palladium features 
<br>
turned off. You will have to buy all new computers to run Palladium 
<br>
enabled software.
<br>
<p>MS revenue stream.
<br>
<p>Under the traditional PC software license, once MS license a program, 
<br>
they can only keep revenue flowing by releasing &quot;upgrades&quot; and 
<br>
convincing people the upgrades are worth purchasing. Producing these 
<br>
upgrades is a lot of work, and they are finding it increasingly 
<br>
difficult to convince anyone the upgrades are worthwhile.
<br>
Clearly, the solution to this problem is to shift software licensing to 
<br>
a subscription model. Under subscription, Microsoft can continue to 
<br>
enjoy steady income from products they do not need to upgrade at all.
<br>
<p>Eventually Palladium is to take over license enforcement. Palladium 
<br>
supports firm cut-off dates, so if you don't pay your subscription fees, 
<br>
you will not get a new Palladium key and will not be able to use 
<br>
Microsoft programs, or the data you created with those programs.
<br>
<p>Even subscription is not the final objective. Microsoft's long term goal 
<br>
is &quot;Software as a Service&quot;, through the .NET Initiative. Software won't 
<br>
be loaded onto your computer at all, it will run &quot;as a service&quot; from 
<br>
Microsoft .NET servers. Your business data will also reside on Microsoft 
<br>
.NET servers somewhere out on the Internet. For access, you will have to 
<br>
be authenticated by a Microsoft Passport server. Subscription is an 
<br>
interim measure because the broadband Internet access required by .NET 
<br>
will not be universally available in the near term.
<br>
<p>So, Palladium will enable MS to totally stop all illegal copies of MS 
<br>
software worldwide. That should at least double their revenue stream for 
<br>
starters.
<br>
<p>If you go the Microsoft route you will be signing on to their revenue 
<br>
stream and you will have to pay the MS tax on a continuing basis.
<br>
<p>That's their business plan anyway.
