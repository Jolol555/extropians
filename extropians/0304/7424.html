<p>
This sunday a television program about life extension aired, as part
<br>
of a biotech series by the educational section of Swedish 
<br>
Television (the public service channels). Yours truly was one of the 
<br>
commentators in the studio. 
<br>
<p>For those who can understand Swedish the site for the series is at
<br>
<a href="http://www.ur.se/tv-universitetet/89">http://www.ur.se/tv-universitetet/89</a>
<br>
There are also streamed versions of the programs (the link 
<br>
&quot;TV-programmen&quot; to the right).
<br>
<p>The program started with a number of more or less likely future
<br>
scenarios, ranging from a 79-year old mother over a future EU with
<br>
extremely strict health regulation to families where mother,
<br>
daughter and granddaughter looked just as young and the immortal
<br>
genemod babies Cain and Abel (!). Not terribly likely, but covered
<br>
many of the issues and made them a visual reality (very nice 
<br>
treatment of smart paper newspapers and documents). 
<br>
<p>I'm surprised by the generally positive approach to life extension. 
<br>
It did not ignore issues like social changes, the risks of mental
<br>
ageing or that life extension might be unevenly distributed, but
<br>
there was none of the &quot;death is good for you&quot; memes. Even more
<br>
impressive was they fairly positive coverage of cryonics - it was
<br>
treated as a big gamble, but not a crazy cult or an affront to
<br>
nature.  Much of this was due to the wonderful presence of Marta
<br>
Sandberg from Australia, who gave a very human and loving face to
<br>
the dream of immortality. She was great! I wish she lived in Sweden.
<br>
<p>The coverage of the life extensions conference in Phoenix last fall
<br>
was also fairly positive. Not much detail (although plenty of
<br>
familiar faces), but it showed that there exists a movement of
<br>
people trying to do something about ageing. Natasha got a brief but
<br>
effective appearance where she explained how we could enhance our
<br>
bodies. 
<br>
<p>The most impressive part was otherwise the discussion of the science
<br>
of ageing, both genetic and free radical theories. Nice pictures of
<br>
cell machinery, modified C elegans and caloric restriction imitation
<br>
with 3-deoxyglucose. It showed that there is real science being
<br>
done in addition to the dreaming. 
<br>
<p>After the main program there was a discussion/interview with me and 
<br>
a professor in gerontology. It was nicely non-confrontational and 
<br>
constructive; I fear *I* looked like the conservative :-)
<br>
<p>Next week the program &quot;the genedoctor is in the house&quot; will be sent,
<br>
where I will be talking about gene testing and stemcells. 
<br>
<p><p>Just some positive media news to cheer you up :-) 
<br>
