<p>No, its correct -- you want to short change the body on the
<br>
essential amino acids so it is forced to breakdown &quot;aged&quot;
<br>
(damaged) proteins.  If you short change on the non-essential
<br>
amino acids it compensates by up-regulating their production.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliminating &quot;essential&quot; aminos would cause a deficiency that the

</em><br>
<p>That is one reason why it is &quot;tricky&quot;.  You want to force the
<br>
body to up-regulate recycling without going into a &quot;deficit&quot; state.
<br>
I suspect one could try a &quot;hormesis&quot; approach where you do a
<br>
day or two in a protein (or essential amino-acid) restricted
<br>
state, then go back to a normal diet so anything lost gets
<br>
replenished.  The benefits of the off-on-off-on cycle is that
<br>
when you are &quot;off&quot; of proper protein intake you get the gene
<br>
upregulation that would continue after you went back &quot;on&quot; proper
<br>
protein intake.
<br>
<p>Of course we need to know how long higher levels of protein recycling
<br>
remain after you do the up-regulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sure if the protein restriction is reducing the amount of protein the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body can produce, or if it avoids the condition of excess proteins being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available that are not needed.
</em><br>
<p>There &quot;should&quot; be feedback loops that control the amount of amino
<br>
acids that get synthesized.  Presumably also loops that regulate
<br>
the number of 26S Proteosomes and lysosomes that are present in
<br>
cells to breakdown proteins.  And there are definitely detection
<br>
systems for damaged proteins that find them and target them to
<br>
the lysosomes or proteosome.
<br>
<p>If you think about kwashiorkor (protein malnutrition) the body
<br>
actually &quot;consumes&quot; itself -- so I'm reasonably certain there
<br>
are links between all of these.  The trick is to bump the
<br>
recycling without entering a malnourished state.
