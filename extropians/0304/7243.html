<em>&gt; Neither of us are qualified, however, I believe that both of us, and everyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else on this list, is bright enough to view the issue, and run with it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should they take an interest. I suspect it was Anders Sandburg, on his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; website who first promulgated, in a large way, using his website, the notion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that increasing complexity is anti-entropic in nature. Life takes energy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material and utilizes it and changes it. Coral polyps form huge colonies, and 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the solar system and turn it into colonies and then, a dyson sphere, then  a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bradury Matrioshka Brain, then a ...?
</em><br>
<p>I was hardly first with that idea - it is inherent in the early 
<br>
extropian writings and the work of Ilya Priogogine. Open systems can use 
<br>
free energy to decrease their own entropy, and certain kinds of systems 
<br>
have an internal dynamics that also increases their complexity (which is 
<br>
still a somewhat vague term even after more than a decade of debate in 
<br>
the alife and complexity community).
<br>
<p>Is there an upper limit to complexity? I think the question can be
<br>
answered if one defines complexity as stored and retrievable information
<br>
- in that case the Bekenstein bound gives an upper limit of kMD for a
<br>
spherical region of mass M and diameter D. If we define complexity in 
<br>
terms of minimal description length it is of course also limited by the 
<br>
Bekenstein bound. But complexity defined in terms of contingency or 
<br>
&quot;information depth&quot; is harder to catch - the information depth of the 
<br>
famous letter dialogue of Victory Hugo (he wrote: &quot;?&quot;, his publisher 
<br>
answered: &quot;!&quot;) was far larger than the actual information content. Here 
<br>
the interpreting system plays an important role in uncompressing 
<br>
meaning, and if that meaning is not strict then there is likely some 
<br>
fuzziness on how much information can be stored or transmitted.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My preliminary answer would be that in a finite region there can only be 
<br>
a finite amount of complexity. But this could very well be an 
<br>
exponential function of the number of available states.
