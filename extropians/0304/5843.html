Barbara computes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A single person making $5.15 per hour, working 6 days a week, 52 weeks per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year would have gross wages of $12,854.40 for the year. (minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, unless they're getting help from someone else such as parents, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work 6 days a week to even begin to make ends meet. Many, many of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold down at least 2 jobs. Usually one of the jobs is part time and one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full time, but some people do 2 full time jobs.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For 2002, this person would have had $797 in FICA taxes withheld, $186 for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medicare, and $518 for federal income tax. On top of this, depending on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the person lived, they might also have to pay state and local income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes. At wages of $12,854, this person is not eligible for the Earned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Income Credit.
</em><br>
<p>or, taxes amounting to (797 + 186 + 518)/12854 = 11.7 percent.
<br>
<p>Shocking, really.  There's no escape even for the poor---this is
<br>
even a little beyond the tithe extracted by theocracies!

<br>
<p><em>&gt; You might want to think about that, when you are recommending that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum wage be lowered or removed.
</em><br>
<p>But what do you say to the arguments so far presented that
<br>
claim that the minimum wage causes unemployment?
<br>
<p>Perhaps you (or some) have the strategy carefully plotted:
<br>
Raise the minimum wage to unprecedented levels---as high
<br>
as possible, even if it approaches the average income---
<br>
and then react to the crushing unemployment it causes by
<br>
redistributing all monies everyone receives.  The optimal
<br>
way that some leftists would prefer to forward the revolution
<br>
would be to put as many people as possible out of work (in
<br>
terms of the normal economy) so that a central command 
<br>
structure would have to arise due to the &quot;crisis&quot;.  Well...
<br>
it worked (or failed to work, depending on your viewpoint)
<br>
back in 1917.
