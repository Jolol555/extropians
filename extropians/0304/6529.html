</em><br>
<p>I don't think that qualifies as evidence. Evidence as presented at the 
<br>
following URL for instance says that homo sapiens were likely cooking 
<br>
meat and otherwise using fire right when they were first evolving 125k+ 
<br>
years ago.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview2c.shtml#fire,%20first%20control">http://www.beyondveg.com/nicholson-w/hb/hb-interview2c.shtml#fire,%20first%20control</a>
<br>
<p>Actually I still am wavering on the idea that cooked meat causes cancer. 
<br>
Many of the studies I have seen people use to claim this end up having 
<br>
problems when you look at them closely. For instance look at this 
<br>
recently reported study:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.applesforhealth.com/WomensHealth/redmeacolc4.html">http://www.applesforhealth.com/WomensHealth/redmeacolc4.html</a>
<br>
<p>this is just a news summary, but can you spot some obvious problems with 
<br>
the conclusions?
<br>
<p>Here's a good page on beyondveg talking about this. It appears from a 
<br>
quick glance at the table summarizing results from one of these human 
<br>
studies that people who overcook their food actually have significantly 
<br>
lower amounts of some cancers.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-1e.shtml">http://www.beyondveg.com/tu-j-l/raw-cooked/raw-cooked-1e.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>The quote from the study authors even says that there was no 
<br>
carcinogenic effect seen. This study is just another case where people 
<br>
with their own anti-meat or anti-fat agendas selectively quote random 
<br>
figures from a study to try and bolster their case to those who won't 
<br>
dig into the real study design and results.
<br>
<p>Also of note at that link is a reported study by Turesky.. a quick 
<br>
Google seems to show he has done plenty of work to show that the human 
<br>
body is fully capable of breaking down/detoxifying HCAs.
<br>
<p>Finally, note that HCAs form primarily in cooked high-protein muscle 
<br>
tissue which has been shown to be one of the least preferred foods of 
<br>
primitive peoples available from a &quot;fresh kill&quot;. Things like cooked 
<br>
liver, brain, or other organs have little to no HCA formation.
