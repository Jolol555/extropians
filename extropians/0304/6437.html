<p><em>&gt; So, what do researchers *besides* Cordain think?  Are you

</em><br>
<p>I've taken a side in the debate, for sure. However in my mind the debate is
<br>
over, except with respect to debating fringe-thinkers who still believe our
<br>
natural diet is nearly or completely vegetarian. 
<br>
<p>Those who would argue that we are genetically adapted to a *grain* based
<br>
diet are in my mind beyond the fringe and hardly worth the trouble of
<br>
debating. Some people will believe anything. :-)
<br>
<p>I've never seen any credible evidence that prehistoric cultures subsisted on
<br>
less than ~30% animal based food sources. My own estimate as an amateur
<br>
researcher is perhaps a bit lower than Cordain's. In some of Cordain's
<br>
papers, such as the one I quoted here, he estimates as much 75% of calories
<br>
from animal sources. I would guess about 45% to 50% based on the
<br>
preponderance of the evidence I've seen from all authors and researchers.
<br>
But then Cordain is far more qualified than me and most other authors to
<br>
make such estimations. Dr. Cordain has made it is his life project to
<br>
understand paleolithic diets.
<br>
<p>The other primary authority is Eaton, who in fact first wrote about the
<br>
health benefits of animal-based paleolithic diets in a major medical
<br>
journal. He was the pioneer researcher in the field. I don't recall his
<br>
estimate of the percentage of calories from animal sources in paleolithic
<br>
times but it is in line with Cordain's. In fact they've published some
<br>
articles together on the subject.
