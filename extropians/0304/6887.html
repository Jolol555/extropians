<p>Excessive amounts of protein synthesis might require more ATP and thus
<br>
more oxidative stress (damaging DNA).  So a proper supply of the non-essential
<br>
amino acids might be a good idea.
<br>
<p>Now whether protein recycling requires even more energy (and therefore creates
<br>
more oxidative stress) is an open question.  The article that started this
<br>
discussion from LEF suggests that is not the case or the cell somehow
<br>
compensates for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Protein damage may occur after the protein is built.
</em><br>
<p>That, I believe is definitely the normal situation.  There are several
<br>
modifications after translation that can damage the structure of the
<br>
protein (especially those that are normally long-lived) -- the protein
<br>
glycosylation that Alteon is trying to reverse with ALT-711 is but
<br>
one of several forms of damage.
<br>
<p>In addition I'm reasonably certain that the enzymes that charge the
<br>
transfer RNA (tRNA) with a specific amino acid are quite specific.
<br>
The ribosome also has some error-correction machinery.  So the incorporation
<br>
of an improper or deformed amino acid is a relatively low probability situation.
<br>
There also seem to be mechanisms to detect proteins that don't properly
<br>
fold so they get immediately recycled.  How this is pulled off I have no
<br>
idea.  But I think one can assume a significant part of the problem comes
<br>
from protein &quot;aging&quot;.  If one can recycle those that are damaged faster --
<br>
then one presumably ends up a protein pool that functions more
<br>
reliably/efficiently.
