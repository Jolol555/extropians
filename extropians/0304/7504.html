Greg Jordan:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My argument is pretty much entirely aesthetic. But that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily make it &quot;personal preference&quot;, either. I have a feeling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetic principles tend to be quite similar across large numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings. 
</em><br>
<p>If this aesthetic appreciation for animals is as widespread as you
<br>
claim, then based on the fact that most people are not vegetarians, we
<br>
can say at least the degree to which people appreciate animals differs
<br>
significantly. I can't fathom that one would be a vegetarian because
<br>
animals appear pleasant to the eye. If anything, you should want to eat
<br>
them more. Perhaps there is a special case of paleodiet theory which
<br>
says, eat what appears pleasing to the senses, as this is the default
<br>
diet of all successful species.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lots of people obviously have the ability to appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals - one look at our culture tells us that. Many people just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrarily stop caring about animals when it interferes with an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (eating meat) that is a nearly universal meme in the society and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered impossible to break (and the connection between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store-packaged meats and real-live animals is heavily suppressed in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; minds of many people).
</em><br>
<p>No doubt there is an evolved instinct to react negatively to the death
<br>
of an animate creature. Of course there is, because all the animals who
<br>
stuck around to watch other animals being eaten by predators became
<br>
seconds. But your reasoning from default insincts to a not-so-obvious
<br>
aesthetic conclusion which somehow implies a particular diet is a
<br>
muddle.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;anthropomorphizing&quot; critique is flawed because nonhuman animals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *do*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have many characteristics in common with humans, not surprising given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common evolutionary history. But again, many people deny evolution,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; many people also deny that humans are a type of animal.
</em><br>
<p>Ordinary animals and humans also have many characteristics unique to
<br>
themselves. Our far-from-ordinary brains do many intractable things, and
<br>
we sometimes invent words to facilitate discussion of them, such as
<br>
'happiness', 'reason', or 'thought'. To say an animal is 'happy' or
<br>
'sad' might help children and bad poets understand animal behavior a
<br>
little better. But it certainly doesn't help me, and it certainly
<br>
doesn't imply anything profound to me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not *too* mysterious to guess that getting shot or throat-slit is
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the top 10 of a deer or cow's daily activities, it seems to me the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burden of proof is on those who argue that animals are just robots
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; don't feel pain or care about what happens to themselves. 
</em><br>
<p>I gather that you feel pain and care about what happens to yourself. But
<br>
this does not imply anything about animals, or even me for that matter.
<br>
<p><p>Keith
