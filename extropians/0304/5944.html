<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer John Taylor Gatto in his book Dumbing Us Down devotes a lot 
<br>
of time to discussing the differences between traditional communities with 
<br>
strong families and modern communities where the families are weaker and the 
<br>
community is more mobile.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel very uncomfortable with the content of the book.  Not that Mr. 
<br>
Gatto doesn't present his thoughts convincingly but that I haven't heard any 
<br>
discussion of his subject.  That makes me so uncomfortable because I think 
<br>
those differences are extremely important and imminently debatable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Grad School I had one of the national experts for my 
<br>
professor in sociology -- that was forty years ago and his name is long since 
<br>
forgotten.  He spent some time detailing the characteristics of the northern 
<br>
middle class family.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recorded all his lectures I took the tape home and shared them 
<br>
with my wife.  That sparked one of the most intense discussions of our 
<br>
marriage.  In fact it may have ultimately ended our marriage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, we were middle class southerners and that is very different 
<br>
from the middle class northerner.  Because of the considerable inducements 
<br>
involved we found ourselves becoming northerners and weren't sure at all that 
<br>
we liked that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly the northern family is not nearly so much an extended family 
<br>
as the southern one.  The northern family is also much more mobile.  It 
<br>
doesn't not have the support structure of the southern family.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read what you wrote above, &quot; who believed that they were a part 
<br>
of a nation, or who believed that they had a people&quot; I hear the essence of 
<br>
what Gatto is saying of the stable traditional society.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you write, &quot;I understand that this does not resonate with some 
<br>
very strong individualists, for whom practically all communal feeling is 
<br>
alien&quot; you are simply describing a person without roots.  They are 
<br>
individualists because they have no community or a strong family.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Gatto also maintains that experts devising rules cannot construct 
<br>
a community that has the closeness of the traditional society.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me go a step further.  I think this subject is particularly 
<br>
appropriate to Extropians.  The central question is shall we have a strong 
<br>
community that achieves our goals or a weak one that is among the first to 
<br>
crack when the singularity approaches?
<br>
