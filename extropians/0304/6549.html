<p><em>&gt; &gt; those became risk factors.  75% of them were dead by age 18!  So this

</em><br>
<p>It is general &quot;common&quot; knowledge among people who study demography.
<br>
The number may not be as high as 75% everywhere but it probably tends
<br>
to be culture specific and it *is* high.
<br>
<p>I would guess that one might find references in works by Austad,
<br>
Olshansky or Vaupel.  Almost anyone who writes a review or book
<br>
on longevity will cite a figure like this.  I've read some of the
<br>
papers on which such conclusions are based and it revolves around
<br>
a lot of digging in cemeteries and computing the age of death of
<br>
the various skeletons found.
<br>
<p>Life was pretty brutal before modern times.  Now -- whether it was
<br>
*that* brutal in paleolithic times is probably open to debate since
<br>
I don't believe we have that many paleolithic cemeteries.  If the
<br>
recent data on human cannibalism [1] is accurate then one might not
<br>
have had much to put into the cemetery.

<br>
<p>1. Humans apparently have variants of the prion protein that
<br>
when carried in its heterozygous variants (one of each type)
<br>
can protect one from kuru (the human variant of Mad Cow disease).
<br>
This &quot;mixed&quot; genotype is apparently present in much higher numbers
<br>
in the population than one would expect from normal genetics -- thus
<br>
there may have been a selection effect *for* this genotype among
<br>
ancestral cannibals.
