<br>
<p>I have to take exception to Lee's reductionist comments.
<br>
<p>Global warming *is* a significant concern.  Here are three reasons
<br>
(and there are probably more) why:
<br>
<p>a) It seems that corals are very sensitive to water temperature.
<br>
<p>Warm up the water, the corals die off, they don't regrow and
<br>
reduce the protection of shorelines causing increased erosion
<br>
of many islands around the world.  (Why this is a case remains
<br>
a mystery to me because given the temperature fluctuations over
<br>
many millions of years one would think the corals would have
<br>
adapted to this.)  So there is likely to be significant erosion
<br>
of islands/shorelines with the decline of coral reef protection.
<br>
This will in turn force individuals living near those shorelines
<br>
to move as well as probably cause greater pollution to nearby
<br>
waters, a reduction in fish habitats, a decline in fish
<br>
abundance and an increase in the price of fish as a human
<br>
nutrient (and this is on top of the many overfished fishery
<br>
resources in the world today).
<br>
<p>b) There are nations that will probably not surive a rise in sea level.
<br>
<p>If the various ice caps and glaciers around the world melt the
<br>
ocean level will rise (though as Spike has pointed out this may
<br>
take some time).  There are nations, e.g. the Maldives,
<br>
for whom rising sea levels could prove fatal [1].  Lee may
<br>
not care about the rise in ocean levels but the people
<br>
living in the Maldives certainly do.
<br>
<p>c) A &quot;warmer&quot; planet provides increased energy to weather patterns.
<br>
<p>Increased energy to weather patterns will likely increase the
<br>
number of hurricanes and typhons and therefore property damage
<br>
and loss of life (that is particularly unextropic).  It will
<br>
also tend to increase your cost of living *Lee Corbin* because
<br>
the insurance companies will distribute some of the repair and
<br>
replacement costs onto your insurance bill.  [Insurance companies
<br>
have very complex allocation methods for this -- &quot;Lets see we
<br>
have to balance the costs of hurricanes in North Carolina with
<br>
the risks of earthquakes in California&quot;.]
<br>
<p>One of the things that I think extropianism *requires* is that
<br>
one needs to pay attention to the consequences of ones actions.
<br>
<p>So, one cannot help it much if people choose to live in the
<br>
neighborhood of a volcano or an earthquake zone -- we don't
<br>
currently have the means to control volcanos or earthquakes.
<br>
But if we can reasonably expect that global warming will
<br>
raise sea levels and eliminate nations or cause other
<br>
widespread disruptions due to shifts in weather patterns
<br>
then we *ought* to pay attention to it -- because global
<br>
warming (whether it is caused by us or a natural process)
<br>
*is* something we can do something about [2].
