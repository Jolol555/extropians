<p>Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you on this, Anders. Your
<br>
question &quot;But what about ketones?&quot; was too interesting to answer without
<br>
doing some research.
<br>
<p>The abstract below indicates that in whole animals ketones enhance the
<br>
synthesis of GABA at the expense of NMDA receptor agonists like aspartate.
<br>
This is not surprising to me. My own experience of the Atkins ketogenic diet
<br>
is that, over time, it tends to dull the mind. This is just exactly what the
<br>
up-regulation of GABA and down-regulation of aspartate should do. On the
<br>
positive side, the down-regulation of NMDA agonists might inhibit
<br>
excitotoxic damage. -gts

<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
Ketone bodies and brain glutamate and GABA metabolism.

Dev Neurosci 1998;20(4-5):358-64    (ISSN: 0378-5866)

<br>

<br>
The effects of ketone bodies on brain metabolism of glutamate and GABA were
<br>
studied in three different systems: synaptosomes, cultured astrocytes and
<br>
the whole animal. In synaptosomes the addition of either acetoacetate or
<br>
3-OH-butyrate was associated with diminished consumption of glutamate via
<br>
transamination to aspartate and increased formation of labelled GABA from
<br>
either L-[2H5-2,3,3,4, 4]glutamine or L-[15N]glutamine. There was no effect
<br>
of ketone bodies on synaptosomal GABA transamination. An increase of total
<br>
forebrain GABA and a diminution of aspartate was noted when mice were
<br>
injected intraperitoneally with 3-OH-butyrate. In cultured astrocytes the
<br>
addition of acetoacetate to the medium was associated with a significantly
<br>
enhanced rate of citrate production and with a diminution in the rate of
<br>
conversion of [15N]glutamate to [15N]aspartate. These data are consistent
<br>
with the hypothesis that the metabolism of ketone bodies to acetyl-CoA
<br>
results in a diminution of the pool of brain oxaloacetate, which is consumed
<br>
in the citrate synthetase reaction (oxaloacetate + acetyl-CoA --&gt; citrate).
<br>
As less oxaloacetate is available to the aspartate aminotransferase
<br>
reaction, thereby lowering the rate of glutamate transamination, more
<br>
glutamate becomes accessible to the glutamate decarboxylase pathway, thereby
<br>
favoring the synthesis of GABA.
