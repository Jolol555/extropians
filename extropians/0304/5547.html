<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not acknowledging what has been done in the world to free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people from oppression, tyranny, and intolerance because of arbitrary 
</em><br>
deeply
<br>
<em>&gt; ingrained disdain based on what some might consider half truths and 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To which Samantha responded to me:
<br>
<p>&quot;If our current actions are about nothing of the kind except in 
<br>
rhetoric then such an exposition is irrelevant to judging said 
<br>
actions.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would challenge your assertion that our current actions have 
<br>
nothing to do with liberation beyond rhetoric. Iraq is currently ruled by a 
<br>
brutal, despotic regime (a point I hope all of us on this list might agree). 
<br>
Though our actions are being taken primarily out of our own self-interest, 
<br>
the Iraqi people will benefit from the removal of that barbaric thug Hussein. 
<br>
As I have said many times, it would be foolish for anyone to suggest that 
<br>
just because our actions are not based on altruism, that the end results 
<br>
which follow them would then be devoid of merit. Unless of course you believe 
<br>
that the removal of Saddam Hussein and his regime would not somehow 
<br>
positively impact the lives of the Iraqi people. If that is indeed the case, 
<br>
then I would respectfully ask that you elaborate on why you feel that 
<br>
removing that butcher would not directly benefit in the long term that 
<br>
beleagured people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   That some people have absolutely nothing positive to say of the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States is deplorable.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Sure.  But this is not the point right now.&quot;
<br>
<p>Not by itself, no, it is not. But when one's argument is based in large part, 
<br>
as some have done, on unending criticism of the United States, then the 
<br>
record of the US needs to be fully analyzed and understood in historical 
<br>
perspective to refute such an argument.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedoms that each and every human enjoys on this
<br>
<em>&gt; planet (those fortunate enough to enjoy some) can all be attributed to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree to the United States. Yet some insist that merely because the US (or 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; any other country) is powerful and in a dominant world position, than it is 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; bad,  or &quot;might makes wrong&quot;, in huMania's words. This position too is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable in any form to many on this list, and the record of the United 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States as compared to other major world powers, most notably the Soviet 
</em><br>
Union 
<br>
<em>&gt; or Nazi Germany, is a necessary part of illustrating why the position of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;might makes wrong&quot; is not appropriate in all cases.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;You are over-simplifying the real objection.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would respectfully disagree. Perhaps this is not an apt description of your 
<br>
point of view, nor was I referring to you specifically in that paragraph, but 
<br>
I have had debates on this forum where people opposed to this action have 
<br>
acknowledged they would like to see the United States &quot;humbled&quot; due to their 
<br>
preeminent position in the world. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Which is the public text, speech and actions that we intend to use our 
<br>
might, 
<br>
right or wrong, to remold the world to our liking whether or not 
<br>
that is what is best for or desired by the people of the 
<br>
countries to be molded.&quot;
<br>
<p>This, I would respectfully argue, is an oversimplification on your part. The 
<br>
United States is not &quot;remolding the world&quot; in our image, or &quot;to our liking&quot; 
<br>
or we would be installing democracies in countries currently ruled by 
<br>
totalitarian thugs that have not sought weapons of mass destruction like 
<br>
Laos, Vietnam, and sadly more African nations then I would care to mention. 
<br>
The United States is acting in its defensive self-interests against a regime 
<br>
that has actively sought weapons of mass destruction, in the recent past 
<br>
invaded its neighbor, and shown a decidedly anti-U.S. fervor. If Saddam 
<br>
Hussein truly possessed no threat to anyone, then why would a body with as 
<br>
many divergent interests such as the UN have supported any resolutions on 
<br>
disarmament, let alone see the need to ferry weapons inspectors in and out of 
<br>
the country for more than a decade?
<br>
<p>&quot;There is nothing democratic or free 
<br>
about changing people's home country to what you might prefer 
<br>
regardless of their own wishes.&quot;
<br>
<p>And there is nothing democratic, free, or humane in being satisfied with 
<br>
allowing a butcher such as Hussein to run roughshod over Iraq for the 
<br>
foreseeable future, which is what the UN, even with its half-hearted talk of 
<br>
disarmament, seemed quite content in allowing. This is not surprising, given 
<br>
their failure to act while genocide occured in Cambodia, Rwanda and scores of 
<br>
other locales. I think it can be argued quite successfully that the Iraqi 
<br>
people are not interested in democracy, they have no political traditions 
<br>
which would give them any reason to be. However, I'm sure like most humans 
<br>
they're interested in a better quality of life for themselves and their 
<br>
families. You may not believe that the US bringing about regime change will 
<br>
bring that. Fair enough. But you cannot seriously argue that the despotism, 
<br>
torture, and arbitrary murder will somehow disappear under Hussein or his 
<br>
sons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I will say again that I feel in some cases Greg's objections are 
</em><br>
legitimate,
<br>
<em>&gt; since I do not consider (and have repeatedly said on this forum) that all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign policy decisions made by the United States have been the correct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones. But regarding  the question repeatedly posed to Samantha and others, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his objections are totally off the mark. The most important reason for this 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; is that Samantha has never adequately answered that question in the many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times Matus, Ron, I or anyone else have asked it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Because it is utterly irrelevant to the question at hand and I 
<br>
have much better things to do than jump through arbitrary hoops.&quot;
<br>
<p>As I will subsequently illustrate, I must disagree that it has no relevance 
<br>
to the question at hand. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Illustrating that the United States helped foster and make possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy in Taiwan, Greece, South Korea, Japan, etc. is not &quot;holding up a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogan&quot;,  nor blind 'americanism'  it is illustrating facts that cannot be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously debated, in addition to pointing out that the United States 
</em><br>
foreign 
<br>
<em>&gt; policy is not the empty and bankrupt vessel some claim it is, ESPECIALLY 
</em><br>
when 
<br>
<em>&gt; it is compared to other major world powers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Samantha's  positions are totally predicated on a belief that the US has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistently supported dictators at the expense of democracy abroad.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely false.  Retract it immediately.&quot;
<br>
<p>I will not retract it at this point, however I will add that I should have 
<br>
said that &quot;It appears to some of us on this list that Samantha's positions 
<br>
are predicated on a belief that the US has consistently supported dictators 
<br>
at the expense of democracy abroad.&quot; In more than one thread (such as one on 
<br>
the Shah of Iran), in discussions with me, you have consistently criticized 
<br>
the US's support of authoritarian regimes in the past. I have countered that 
<br>
the US did not have a choice between democracy and authoritarianism, it had 
<br>
choices between authoritarianism and worse. The world of the 1950s, 60s, and 
<br>
70s saw dozens and dozens of democratic experiments fail, replaced by brutal 
<br>
despotic regimes. Despite that, you have consistently criticized the United 
<br>
States for in the past dealing with unsavory regimes. If you wish to fully 
<br>
elaborate on your position regarding the US and its past dealings with 
<br>
authoritarians and totalitarians during World War II and the Cold War which 
<br>
followed it, I will gladly listen. And, if need be, I will then fully retract 
<br>
my statement and offer a complete apology. If not, then you will have to 
<br>
forgive myself and the others for in some sense still believing it...:) The 
<br>
position I perhaps mistakenly attributed to you has been endorsed on C-SPAN 
<br>
in the last week by Daniel Ellsburg, and before that Howard Zinn, so perhaps 
<br>
it is more widespread than you would think.
<br>
<p>All that being said, I am simply confused as to how it is that you can 
<br>
criticize the United States for in the past supporting authoritarian regimes 
<br>
and in your view &quot;preventing democracy&quot; and yet now severely criticize them 
<br>
for attempting to bring (by a result of their actions) democracy and freedom, 
<br>
or at worst the removal of a brutal tyrant, to the people of Iraq.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
