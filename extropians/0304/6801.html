<p>Re: Progeria gene discovery

<p><em>&gt; This is great news and of great personal importance to myself and family. One

</em><br>
<em>&gt; loss to all that knew her.
</em><br>
<p>Alex, you (and your friends) have my sympathies.  You may want to review
<br>
the &quot;Aging Gene&quot; messages (4 or 5 or so) over the last couple of days
<br>
in the Javien Forum or the ExI archives.  They provide some very useful URLs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although the number of children born with this syndrome is very low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (currently around 30 worldwide) I would agree that &quot;it does need shootin&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a major step towards switching off the clock for all of us.
</em><br>
<p>I would question the number of 30 -- I've seen varying numbers
<br>
but they seem to be in the range of 1 to 8 per million children.
<br>
<p>While the discovery of the gene will certainly help point out
<br>
some mechanisms by which aging *can* occur -- that is not the
<br>
same as knowing how/why aging occurs in the majority of people.
<br>
<p>Lenny Guarante (a reasnably informed MIT researcher in the biology
<br>
of aging) pointed out in one article that it may only shed
<br>
limited light on &quot;natural&quot; aging.
<br>
<p>But at least now we have the damn gene!
<br>
<p>Though it appears to have gotten deleted from my story for /.
<br>
(<a href="http://science.slashdot.org">http://science.slashdot.org</a>), my comments were approximately
<br>
as follows:
<br>
<p>We have the genome.
<br>
We have the 2 accelerated aging syndrome genes.
<br>
We have at least 100+ DNA repair genes (a significant majority).
<br>
We have most of the genes responsible for cancer (tumor promoting
<br>
and tumor suppressing genes).
<br>
<p>If we (as a species) can't nail this process (aging) clearly
<br>
against the wall in this decade then we probably deserve to be
<br>
displaced by an unfriendly AI.
<br>
