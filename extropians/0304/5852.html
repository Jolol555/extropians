<p>Rafal, could you explain &quot;PD&quot;?

<p><em>&gt; I started recently working with a laser capture microscope and we have

</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't say they haven't been found -- but would agree that they
<br>
haven't been found in the quantities one would expect for increased
<br>
free radical production to be considered a major cause of aging.
<br>
<p>*BUT* if one has a cascade effect -- increased mitochondrial FR
<br>
production leading to increased double strand breaks (in the nucleus)
<br>
that trigger apoptosis -- *then* you have a real scientific problem --
<br>
&quot;*How* do you find something that &quot;disappears&quot; almost as fast as it is
<br>
produced?&quot; [In this case aging is a very gradual process because you
<br>
are losing cells that are only being replaced to a limited extent
<br>
by circulating stem cells -- which may themselves be a declining
<br>
population.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Give us a couple million $ and an extra sequencer or two, and we'll get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. Guaranteed.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so if the above scenario I've outlined is the case.
<br>
Rafal -- seriously -- do some thinking about cascade effects.
<br>
I've got a fairly robust theory of aging that I call the &quot;energy
<br>
catastrophe theory of aging&quot; involving the improper repair of
<br>
double strand breaks causing increased production of proteins
<br>
that will not fold properly whose production and breakdown
<br>
produces increased demands on energy production, free radicals
<br>
from which in turn produce even more double strand breaks.
<br>
<p>If this is correct then one has the problem of looking for
<br>
something that simply isn't going to be there!
<br>
<p>It requires some much more complex methods such as measuring
<br>
the percentage of proteins that are produced and will not
<br>
fold correctly and must therefore be broken down -- plus
<br>
some assessment of the rates of apoptosis -- plus some
<br>
analysis of the rates of the production of new mitochondria
<br>
(due to increased energy demands).
<br>
<p>As I said -- it is *not* an easy problem.
<br>
<p>(If you email me offlist, I've got a very rough draft of notes
<br>
and references on this that you may want to review.)
