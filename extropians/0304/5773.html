<p>This is where it gets strange.  Each copy can only access their own body,
<br>
their own thoughts and their own experiences.  What happens to one copy may
<br>
not happen to the other copy.  As such, they each have a different
<br>
point-of-view.  Making a duplicate copy does not change the point-of-view of
<br>
the original.  It creates a new point-of-view.  The original point-of-view
<br>
still grow old and dies or is destroyed in the destructive copy scenario.
<br>
That point-of-view never is modified to achieve immortality.  It is only the
<br>
newly created point-of-view that experiences immortality.  Strangely, this
<br>
new point-of-view has never experienced being mortal.  It may &quot;remember&quot;
<br>
being mortal in that we have programmed it with a copy of all the memories
<br>
from the original, but it never actually experienced them.  These two
<br>
points-of-view are different/separate people.  One is mortal and is never
<br>
saved.  One is immortal and was never in danger.  My viewpoint is that these
<br>
are two separate people who are extremely-identical twins.  They are not the
<br>
same person, but two very similar people.
