Eliezer mentioned my favorite null hypothesis.  Eat what is 
<br>
most convenient and enjoyable.  I have made a few changes 
<br>
so far.  The Paleodiet suggests additional changes which 
<br>
means time, effort and reeducating taste buds.  Paleodiets 
<br>
also conflict with some expert recommendations.  It's harder 
<br>
when experts disagree.  :)
<br>
<p>I saw a book by Loren Cordain recently.  The bibliography 
<br>
looked nice.  I'll look for some more rigorous literature on 
<br>
Paleodiet ideas when I get to the competing hypothesis 
<br>
part of my studies.  I don't think it wise for me to endorse 
<br>
or reject the idea from what I have seen so far and if I'm
<br>
going to look at it, I may as well go to the source.  That 
<br>
ought to be about that for me but to be chatty...
<br>
<p>I have read in several nutrition books that calcium is 
<br>
abundant in some plants but poorly absorbed.  I also recall 
<br>
a study of rural Chinese diets saying they seemed to get 
<br>
plenty of calcium from vegetables.  I think researchers 
<br>
suggested that plant calcium may be poorly absorbed if you 
<br>
eat animal products.  One could as easily theorize poor plant 
<br>
absorption if you eat dairy products.  So, would the idea be 
<br>
that plant calcium is absorbed fine or that Paleodiets include 
<br>
a lot of plants so the poor absorption is not a problem or 
<br>
that dairy does interfere with calcium absorption from plant 
<br>
sources or that calcium is best gotten from bone marrow or 
<br>
that we don't really benefit from as much calcium as nutrition 
<br>
textbooks suggests.  The main argument for dairy products 
<br>
is calcium.  They are not the only source but they are a 
<br>
convenient and tasty source for many people.
<br>
<p>Also it's not enough for me to show that a Paleodiet is healthy 
<br>
but I would want to see that dairy is unhealthy before I gave 
<br>
up dairy.  Not that dairy is unhealthy for some people but that 
<br>
dairy is unhealthy for most people (likely including me).  I'm not 
<br>
so sure that nutrient density is something rewarding to optimize.  
<br>
It looks like once you get a certain level of nutrients while keeping 
<br>
your calories below a certain level the rewards level off (except
<br>
for a few nutrients which can be supplemented).  Like alcohol I 
<br>
would ask how much dairy and grain I can eat without paying a 
<br>
definite health cost.  Eating more meats on the other hand I like.  
<br>
So if I can discover that meats are just as healthy as grains and 
<br>
dairy that would lower my dairy somewhat by substitution.
