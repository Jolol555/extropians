<p>Harvey as gts tried to point out to you, historical evidence clearly 
<br>
shows some dramatic negative health changes- first back when agriculture 
<br>
came along, and more recently as I tried to point out here there was a 
<br>
very dramatic rise in heart disease (especially the new form- heart 
<br>
attacks), cancer, etc. during the first half of the 20th century. That 
<br>
rise in incidence continues currently, and now we also have dramatic 
<br>
rises in things like diabetes... all while much of the first world 
<br>
population has faithfully eaten what nutritional scientists claim is the 
<br>
safest diet - &quot;the food pyramid&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, I can understand the feeling of wanting to do your own research and 
<br>
come up with what you think is an even better way to eat than the now 
<br>
almost-discredited food pyramid, but how can you be any more sure that 
<br>
your ideas will turn out any better? It seems like you are essentially 
<br>
going to experiment on yourself, and based on the results we've seen 
<br>
from nutritional science so far it seems to have so little actually 
<br>
figured out about how the human body really interacts with food that its 
<br>
recommendations and findings often seem to have very significant 
<br>
unforseen negative consequences. Why risk that when you can choose a 
<br>
diet that has significant historical evidence on its side that it will 
<br>
not be harmful? You can still supplement it with substances that seem to 
<br>
be well-proven to help extend lifespan.
<br>
<p>P.S. Can anyone show me some real proof that vegetarians live longer? 
<br>
Some evidence mentioned at URL below says they don't.
