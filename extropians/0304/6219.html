<p>The way I interpret the video is of citizens expressing
<br>
complete relief that this time the coalition would not
<br>
pack up and leave the minute the government of Iraq fell.
<br>
I can just imagine the horror of the Baghdad partisans
<br>
in 1991, as the brutal government agents emerged from
<br>
hiding and began pointing out people: &quot;...he's one, he's
<br>
one, he's one...&quot;  Those people were never heard from
<br>
again.  Surely they suffered the most horrifying deaths
<br>
that could be imagined.  The citizens remembered that,
<br>
and were not about to cheer a coalition victory until
<br>
they were sure it really is over.
<br>
<p>The images demonstrated to the Arab world that they had
<br>
been lied to.  What was unclear four weeks ago is obvious
<br>
to the casual observer now.  spike
