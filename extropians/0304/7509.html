<p>I think it's clear they are discussing vegetable oils produced by 
<br>
industrialized, high-heat methods. Traditionally produced cold-pressed 
<br>
olive oil is an exception, but also rather low in potentially useful 
<br>
saturated fats. It's good for salads or anytime you need a very liquid 
<br>
fat at room temp, but I wouldn't prefer to cook with it compared with a 
<br>
more chemically stable mix of mostly saturated fats.

<p>Well I believe you are speculating here. AFAIK traditional Eskimos sat 
<br>
on their butts for most of the winter. Let's have some URLs to look at 
<br>
please. Also the page clearly mentioned that in the area of France with 
<br>
higher saturated fat/organ meat intake they had significantly fewer 
<br>
heart attacks.
<br>
<p>There is quite a bit of other info on that page, do you have any further 
<br>
comments?
