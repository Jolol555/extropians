</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, here I think the amazon review you mentioned did a disservice to
<br>
Diamond.  Diamond doesn't seem to think that humans are destructive
<br>
/on the whole/.  But in the course of documenting primitive human
<br>
species, and human history since then, he notes that every human
<br>
culture ever documented has had warfare and other violence.  
<br>
<p>I think his argument here is that certain human traits - like the
<br>
human potentials for violence, vengeance, and short-term focus - were
<br>
/adaptive/ in paleolithic times and in hunter gatherer societies up
<br>
until now, but are non-adaptive in industrialized societies with the
<br>
power to more radically harm each other.  
<br>
<p>But over all what Diamond is saying is that every human culture shows
<br>
signs of the same core set of traits.  The net effect has been quite
<br>
constructive, but not without some destructive events occurring as
<br>
well, and not without more potential for destruction as a result of
<br>
certain elements of human nature in the future.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm merely pointing out that I think Diamond is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong if he thinks over-hunting is evidence of a destructive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency in paleo humans. Dropping napalm on the Vietnamese 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might constitute such evidence, but naively over-hunting a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species in an effort to feed oneself? Where is the logic in that,
</em><br>
mez?
<br>
<p>The problem isn't the intention behind the action, or even how the
<br>
action played out in paleolithic times.  The problem is how that human
<br>
behavioral trait might affect the world today or in the next century.
<br>
<p><p>For example, humans seem to have an innate urge to vengeance.  That
<br>
urge is almost certainly a major contributor to problems in areas like
<br>
the former Yugoslavia, Israel/Palestine, Congo, etc...  It's also
<br>
likely a major contributor to terrorism.
<br>
<p>Really if you think about it, this is a very extropian idea.  It's
<br>
saying that human nature is adapted to the paleolithic environment,
<br>
rather than the modern environment.  Once you grant that, you're a
<br>
step closer to accepting the idea that the modification of human
<br>
nature through technology can have /societal/ (not just individual)
<br>
benefits.
<br>
