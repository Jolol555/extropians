<p>I have to agree with Mike on this one. I looked at FAIR's report:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;FAIR examined the 393 on-camera sources who appeared in nightly news 
<br>
stories about Iraq on ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC 
<br>
Nightly News and PBS's NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. The study began one 
<br>
week before and ended one week after Secretary of State Colin Powell's 
<br>
February 5 presentation at the U.N., a time that saw particularly 
<br>
intense debate about the idea of a war against Iraq on the national and 
<br>
international level.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Overall, 68 sources, or 17 percent of the total on-camera sources, 
<br>
represented skeptical or critical positions on the U.S.'s war policy-- 
<br>
ranging from Baghdad officials to people who had concerns about the 
<br>
timing of the Bush administration's war plans. The percentage of 
<br>
skeptical sources ranged from 21 percent at PBS (22 of 106) to 14 
<br>
percent at NBC (18 of 125).  ABC (16 of 92) and CBS (12 of 70) each had 
<br>
17 percent skeptics.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fair.org/reports/iraq-sources.html">http://www.fair.org/reports/iraq-sources.html</a>
<br>
<p>Imagine that! ABC had the effrontery to allow 17 percent -- 17 
<br>
percent!!! -- of it's on-air sources to be skeptics about the war. My 
<br>
god, that's almost 1 in 5!!! Any reasonable person would acknowledge 
<br>
that antiwar views should be restricted to, uh, what Mike? 5 percent? 10 
<br>
percent?
<br>
<p>Too bad the report doesn't mention Fox. In any case, during wartime, it 
<br>
appears the skeptics should be reduced to 0 percent:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&quot;Once the war against Saddam Hussein begins, we expect every American 
<br>
to support our military, and if you can't do that, just shut up.
<br>
<p>Americans, and indeed our foreign allies who actively work against our 
<br>
military once the war is underway, will be considered enemies of the 
<br>
state by me.
<br>
<p>Just fair warning to you, Barbra Streisand and others who see the world 
<br>
as you do. I don't want to demonize anyone, but anyone who hurts this 
<br>
country in a time like this, well. Let's just say you will be spotlighted.
<br>
<p>Talking points invites all points of view and believes vigorous debate 
<br>
strengthens the country, but once decisions have been made and lives are 
<br>
on the line, patriotism must be factored in.&quot;
<br>
<p>- Bill O'Reilly
<br>
<p>&quot;We have the responsibility to support our President in time of 
<br>
conflict. This President, in my opinion, is going to war against Saddam 
<br>
Hussein, and every American should be giving him their support when that 
<br>
time comes.&quot;

<br>
<p>BTW, I also visited Media Research Center's report on media coverage at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org/specialreports/2003/warnews1.asp">http://www.mediaresearch.org/specialreports/2003/warnews1.asp</a> , but 
<br>
apparently missed the sections where they did comparable analysis to 
<br>
FAIR (all I saw was a bunch of opinions and anecdotal evidence).
