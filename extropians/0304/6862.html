<p>Johnny, you are so young.  Do allow me to tell you
<br>
how it was.
<br>
<p>As near as I have been able to determine from my
<br>
study of Kerouac et.al, the term cat was used
<br>
liberally for those who were aware of the &quot;scene&quot;
<br>
in a positive way.  The term perhaps was derived
<br>
from the 1920s proto-jazz milieu where musicians
<br>
were known as hep-cats.  In my own jazz band in
<br>
the 70s, I often heard the term &quot;cats&quot; to refer
<br>
to musicians.  I believe the term &quot;hep&quot; later
<br>
showed up in Kerouac as &quot;hip&quot; and hipster and
<br>
hipster dadio.
<br>
<p>Consider the 1953 cult classic &quot;The Wild One&quot;
<br>
with Marlin Brando.  This movie contains the
<br>
famous lines
<br>
<p>&quot;Johnny, what are you rebelling against?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Whaddya got?&quot;
<br>
<p>The far more remarkable thing about this movie
<br>
is that it contains a scene where two young bikers
<br>
do a routine in which one drums on the bar while
<br>
the other does a rhythmic poem of sorts, which
<br>
might well be the earliest rap song.  The loose-
<br>
fitting and fluid use of definition anticipates
<br>
Kerouac, whose On the Road was still four years
<br>
from being published.
