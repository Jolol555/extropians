<p>By your logic it puts the burden of proof on you who advocate changing the
<br>
diet from what we've multiplied on in the last 12,000 years.  Sure, pure
<br>
grains aren't healthy, but the healthiest societies today are the ones eating
<br>
a mix of grains, plants, and lean or fishy meats.  It works, and we should
<br>
either be adapted to it or else it should have little effect.  You want to cut
<br>
out those grains, you have to argue.
<br>
<p>And I think this whole &quot;4 million years&quot; thing is questionable.  Were hominids
<br>
eating the same thing for all that time?  I doubt it.  And what about the 20
<br>
million years of primates eating fruits?  Although chimps eat some meat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you believe we've evolved so much in the last 12,000 years then you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to explain, for example, how it is that humanity could be fully adapted to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, see, there are different populations of humans who've been eating
<br>
different things.  Obviously people without the dairy background shouldn't be
<br>
drinking or eating it.  And people who have been actually eating a paleo diet
<br>
instead of domesticated grains, like the aborigines, have more reasons for
<br>
concern.  But Europeans *do* have the lactose tolerance and we have been
<br>
eating grains and beans for a long time.  Of course there are ways of dealing
<br>
with the lactose, like yogurt.
<br>
<p>(Although... agriculture took a while to spread across Europe.  Possibly
<br>
people from the Middle East are better adapted to it than the Irish, say.)
<br>
<p>Look, no one's saying the paleodiet is evil.  But when the longest lived
<br>
people on the planet have a diet which includes *white* rice, it's hard to
<br>
take claims of the evils of grains too seriously.  There's limited evidence
<br>
from evolution/archaeology, and limited evidence from nutrition, and then
<br>
there's the evidence of our eyes seeing living people right now.
