<br>
&lt;&lt;On a Personal Fear scale of, let's say, 0 is &quot;No kidding, seeing a live 
<br>
spider scares me into cardiac arrest&quot; and 10 is &quot;No kidding, 
<br>
interdimensional demons are sucking my brain out with a straw right this 
<br>
very instant and I am powerless to stop them&quot;, I'd say &quot;Xtian theocracy in 
<br>
America at the _Handmaid's Tale_ level&quot; is about a 3 or 4 and &quot;militant 
<br>
Islamism fomenting a global culture war to impose global Sharia&quot; is at 
<br>
least a 6. Doesn't mean I have my eyes closed.
<br>
I do believe that I can have a much more direct influence in forestalling 
<br>
or correcting an American Xtian theocracy than I can in forestalling any 
<br>
other variety of theocracy that comes to mind.-- 
<br>
I am not here to have an argument. I am here as part of a civilization. 
<br>
Sometimes I forget. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I would rate a Theocracy occurring domestically, at level 2 at best. And the 
<br>
enabling of a Global Caliphate under Sharia seems to be, yes, a 6 or 7. If 
<br>
you believe Peter Gale at the University of Pennsylvania, Al Qeida has a fair 
<br>
chance of knocking out the USA through simultaneous attacks on power lines, 
<br>
and plants, and data centers and comm lines (data hot sites too!).  Actually, 
<br>
there is a greater chance of Islamic Radicalism costing millions more deaths, 
<br>
then it is of eventually succeeding.
