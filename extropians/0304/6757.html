<br>
<p>While troops won't be replacing their assault rifles for ray guns just yet, 
<br>
high-tech lasers are nearly ready for other combat uses.Last year the U.S. 
<br>
and Israeli armies field-tested a chemical laser made by TRW that 
<br>
successfully knocked out 100 mm rockets and artillery shells. 
<br>
<p>But making powerful lasers fit for use against enemy artillery means that 
<br>
they'll have to be mobile enough to keep up with fast-moving tanks and other 
<br>
units that make up a modern fighting force. 
<br>
<p>And the key to developing a more agile laser system may lie in research being 
<br>
done at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.
<br>
<p><p><p>Making Laser Systems Mobile
<br>
<p>&quot;This is actually a very pivotal time in terms of high-powered laser 
<br>
systems,&quot; says Brent Dane, project manager for high-energy lasers at Lawrence 
<br>
Livermore Labs.
<br>
<p>For about six years he and his team have been hard at work on a high-powered, 
<br>
portable, electric laser for the U.S. Department of Defense.
<br>
<p>&quot;If there's one sort of key aspect of a solid-state laser, it's mobility,&quot; 
<br>
Dane says. &quot;And the mobility comes from a very high electrical efficiency and 
<br>
architectures which support compact, very lightweight designs.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>Humvee-Mounted Defense
<br>
<p>Using special &quot;beam director&quot; software, a laser can lock onto an in-flight 
<br>
missile and heat the explosives inside their metal shell, causing them to 
<br>
detonate before they reach their target.
<br>
<p>Lawrence Livermore Laboratories has just developed a 25-kilowatt laser and is 
<br>
working on a 100-kilowatt version, which Dane says will supply enough power 
<br>
to knock out a missile in two to three seconds.
<br>
<p>The 100-kilowatt laser should be ready for combat by 2010, Dane says. 
<br>
However, the battlefield technology doesn't end with the lasers. The lasers 
<br>
will likely ride into battle atop hybrid electric Humvees.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you look at the typical traction battery that's being proposed for these 
<br>
hybrid electric vehicles,&quot; Dane says, &quot;that battery will be adequate for 
<br>
actually powering a hundred-kilowatt laser system.&quot;
<br>
