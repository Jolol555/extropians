### Aubrey would be more competent to answer these objections but let me try
<br>
too:
<br>
<p>Most of the proteins in mitos are nuclear-encoded anyway. The way the
<br>
nuclear genes, usually present in only two copies, achieve large protein
<br>
output is by having relatively stable mRNA's which act as amplifiers of
<br>
their function. If you transfer the mtDNA to the nucleus and set the
<br>
nuclear-encoded mtRNA polycistronic transcript to a high copy number (by
<br>
stabilizing it in the cytoplasm), you should be able to make the same amount
<br>
of protein as made from the 10,000 mtDNAs currently present in our cells.
<br>
<p>I don't know if there is an increase in the mutation rate at highly
<br>
transcriptionally active loci (where the sense DNA strand indeed has to be
<br>
pulled open for the RNA to be synthesized), but this couldn't be a higher
<br>
mutation rate than what you have in the mtDNA now, with all mitos actually
<br>
recycling their DNA about every two weeks, as compared to once ~70 years for
<br>
some neurons. Also, transcription in the nucleus, behind the nuclear
<br>
membranes, might be safer than being in the mitochondrion, with all the free
<br>
radicals generated in close vicinity. Something like keeping the chips
<br>
encoding a nuclear plant's safety measures in the manager's office as
<br>
opposed to the reactor enclosure.
