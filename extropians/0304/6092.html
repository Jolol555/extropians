</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The events witnessed today were similiar in context to the destruction of

<em>&gt; the Nazi headquarters in Berlin in WWII, and the fall of the Berlin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wall in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 89.  People viewint those events witnessed the downfall of facism, and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; tipping point to the downfall of non-democratic oppression, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downfall of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the horrific statist imposed stagnation that has befallen the people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle east for so many years.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The people were exhibiting pure joy, why no recognition of this salient

<em>&gt; event in the history of the spreading of democracy and freedom throughout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Where is the joy at the spreading of freedom and democracy on this

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very well said, Michael. Those tremendous events and images are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly worth the attention and comment of everyone on this list. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself was reminded of the scene in Ethiopia on May 21, 1991, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few days which followed it, where thousands of Ethiopians celebrated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fall of the Soviet backed Mengistu regime. Children were playing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top fallen statues of Lenin, and like in Iraq, many people dragged the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statues triumphantly through the streets. For me, this is a scene that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never gets old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They celebrate the fall of the Communist Derg as the national holiday 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Ethiopia, one can easily imagine that April 9th will soon become a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day of yearly celebration and remembrance for the Iraqi people.

<p>Have you ever been present when new-folk were shooting, and then later 
<br>
seen the results on TV?  What they displayed probably happened, but it 
<br>
was *highly* selected for ... usually it's for entertainment value, and 
<br>
that's probable here, but it's also quite likely that they were 
<br>
&quot;advised&quot; that certain shots were better than others.  Some sources 
<br>
claim that looters &amp; celebrators &amp; rioters (well it was riotous 
<br>
behavior) all together only added up to a thousand or so.  And I'd 
<br>
certainly cheer.  It means 1) a madman has been deposed and 2) they 
<br>
aren't going to be bombing me any more.  And 3) the water may be coming 
<br>
back on soon.  All three quite desireable.
<br>
<p>The cost may have been quite high, but it could easily have been worse 
<br>
(how many won't realize that?).  Of course, the interesting question is 
<br>
&quot;what happens next&quot;.  That will be the determining answer as to whether 
<br>
or not there was any real reason to cheer.  One can hope for less than 
<br>
the worst (actually, one can hope for the best, but I think expecting it 
<br>
would be unreasonable).  I notice that the British have already 
<br>
annointed some Sheik to &quot;assemble an administrative organization&quot;.  I 
<br>
don't know anything else about him, or what his area of coverage is 
<br>
intended to be, but he appears to come from an outlying area.
