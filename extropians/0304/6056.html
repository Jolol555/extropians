<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think determining which is the best ESS is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; what we need to be discussing. However, I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; want to emphasize that I am looking at an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; evolutionary society not a static one.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem with the southern middle class society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; was that in many ways it was too static.
</em><br>
<p>I wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why would you say so?  Was (or is) it likely to be too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unaccepting of new ideas, have too little emphasis on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; education, or what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The south IMHO spent too much time on spilt milk and maintaining 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supremacy over the black race.  I am in an odd position in that I am a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; southerner whose immediate ancestors of that time fought for Mr. Lincoln.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Never the less that is my observation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I find myself welcoming the possibility of discussing the ideas of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gatto but unwilling to try to immediately prescribe what a Gatto like society 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be like.  Even a thorough statement on my part would tend to draw 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battle lines -- lines that I don't intend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I am much taken by Gatto's report on the dialectic method of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Puritans.  They did not build their society based on experts opinions or on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dictates of the powerful.  There is no doubt in my mind that through the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialectic they made some horrible mistakes.  But equally they corrected those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; errors (IMO) and became very progressive.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        As our future society will be determined through trial and error 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps a good way to start would be in a discussion of that particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dialectic method?
</em><br>
<p>Well, there was just the beginning of a discussion of Gatto 
<br>
last summer that you may wish to peruse.
<br>
<p><a href="http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::WjkkGGAr-SgVy-VSZT-Jh5s-ZxorRlQUHEEc">http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::WjkkGGAr-SgVy-VSZT-Jh5s-ZxorRlQUHEEc</a>
<br>
<p>Michael Wiik posted an URL to Gatto's book.  It all sounded a little
<br>
like &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; talk to me, that is, with rather vague
<br>
over-generalizations, and identifications of themes and links
<br>
that are more speculative than factual, and which also seem to defy
<br>
the wisdom in &quot;Never attribute to malice what may simply be stupidity...&quot;
<br>
and so on.
<br>
<p>But I could be wrong.  And I wouldn't mind re-examining Gatto's
<br>
theses.
