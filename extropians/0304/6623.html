More like he's toting a knife, and you're carrying not only a .45, but 
<br>
also an UZI.  And you weigh 5 times what he does, and are 3 times as 
<br>
tall.  And that's still underestimating the mis-match.
<br>
<p>During the middle-ages the great crime that the Christians charges the 
<br>
Muslims with was the burning of the Library at Alexandria.  They didn't 
<br>
do it, but they were blamed anyway.  (It did happen while they were in 
<br>
charge, soon after the conquest of Alexandria.)  Now Bagdad's library 
<br>
wasn't as significant, but it wasn't minor.  Especially if Arabic is you 
<br>
native tongue.  Whatever our reputation was, it's now worse.  That we 
<br>
didn't do it isn't going to cut much ice.  We were in charge, and didn't 
<br>
do anything to stop it or put out the fire, or even collect the scraps 
<br>
of parchment that flutter out on the flames.
