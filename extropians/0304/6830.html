<em>&gt; ### According to game theory, certain strategies are inherently unstable due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the coordination problem.  Forced coordination, as in legislation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impose a monopoly bargaining entity in the form of labor unions, or to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual bargaining for wages, does solve the problem, which is why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately after the imposition the law there is an increase in income to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beneficiaries of the law (as in unionized workers).
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what this BS about coordination is all about,
<br>
but I do see that you are pointing out that for a particular
<br>
set of workers, their wages will go up if it's mandated some
<br>
way, or they achieve it some way through bargaining.  Yes,
<br>
if tomorrow Bush passed an emergency measure (that he somehow
<br>
had the power to do) that said every teacher in the U.S. was 
<br>
to get a 50% pay increase, then indeed every teacher would
<br>
make more money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the long run, due to lower productivity, both the workers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the businesses, and the customers suffer, but this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different story.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  But what about the following *immediate* effect:  if all
<br>
the janitors in the U.S. get their wages doubled overnight,
<br>
then fewer janitors are *immediately* with jobs.  Likewise, if
<br>
all unions were busted tomorrow (by equally magical fiat), then
<br>
the total number of employed persons would *immediately* go up.
<br>
Right?
<br>
