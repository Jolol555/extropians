</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't say &quot;exorbitant cost.&quot; I'm not personally going broke on a diet
<br>
of lean meats, fish fowl, eggs, fruits, vegetables and nuts. In fact many
<br>
processed foods are more expensive than the plain unprocessed foods found
<br>
around the perimeter of most supermarkets. 
<br>
<p>I rarely venture into the middle isles, except perhaps occasionally for
<br>
frozen vegetables, having no need for the unnatural processed food garbage
<br>
they mostly contain. 90% of my food shopping is done in the fresh produce
<br>
and fresh fish and meats sections. I might then pick up a carton of eggs and
<br>
then I'm outta' there. 
<br>
<p>But in general, yes, I agree that dairy and grain are historically cheap
<br>
sources of calories. This is their main if not their only redeeming quality:
<br>
they help to prevent famine. High-fat dairy and high-carb breads were a
<br>
cornucopia to the ancients, many of whom faced famine due likely to the
<br>
over-hunting of various animal species by their predecessors. Modern
<br>
economies, including those in the first and second worlds, became dependent
<br>
on grain and dairy products. This dependency on dairy and grain helped to
<br>
instill the milk and bread memes firmly into the modern mind even despite
<br>
the absence of the threat of famine.
