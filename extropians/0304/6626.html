<a href="mailto:charleshixsn@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20GOV:%20US%20Reputation%20(RE:%20Arab%20World%20Stunned%20by%20Baghdad's%20Fall)">charleshixsn@earthlink.net</a> writes: &quot;More like he's toting a knife, and you're 
<br>
carrying not only a .45, but  also an UZI.  And you weigh 5 times what he 
<br>
does, and are 3 times as  tall.  And that's still underestimating the 
<br>
mis-match.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles, the problem is that if I allow him to stab me I will be just 
<br>
as dead.  We don't want to see another 9-11.  Sadaam certainly had the 
<br>
ability and no doubt the willingness to do it to us again.  As I said before, 
<br>
&quot;If pushed hard enough all analogies breakdown.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Charles added, &quot;During the middle-ages the great crime that the 
<br>
Christians charges the Muslims with was the burning of the Library at 
<br>
Alexandria.  They didn't do it, but they were blamed anyway.  (It did happen 
<br>
while they were in charge, soon after the conquest of Alexandria.)  Now 
<br>
Bagdad's library wasn't as significant, but it wasn't minor.  Especially if 
<br>
Arabic is you native tongue.  Whatever our reputation was, it's now worse.  
<br>
That we didn't do it isn't going to cut much ice.  We were in charge, and 
<br>
didn't do anything to stop it or put out the fire, or even collect the scraps 
<br>
of parchment that flutter out on the flames.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonsense, it was there library and it was Iraqis stealing their own 
<br>
heritage.  Why didn't they fore see what was likely to happen and take 
<br>
measures to prevent it?  We would have cooperated I am sure.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think your basic problem is that you are not going back to prime 
<br>
sources to find out what the middle easterners think of us and why they think 
<br>
it.  The Saudi newspaper today was very enlightening if you keep up with 
<br>
middle eastern affairs and read between the lines.
