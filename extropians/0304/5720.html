<p>It would be hard for me not to see a visit with the divine as a &quot;magic genie&quot; which would just possibly give me three or more wishes.  Then again, I might be so totally boweled over I just might forget everything I had wanted to ask for.  
<br>
<p>As I somehow imagine it, I would know an angel or God simply by the sheer physical majesty (intense glow, levitating, telepathy, overwhelming presence) and overall supernatural &quot;vibe.&quot;  You would not need any tests done, you would instantly know.  
<br>
<p>Just by it appearing I would have matters of personal faith move into the realm of a sure knowledge which would thrill my heart no end!  That alone would make my meeting with the divine or its agents the greatest event of my life.  Everything in many ways would simply fall into place for me from there.  
<br>
<p>I would be extremely curious as to why I was granted this very rare visitation so many want and never get in their lives.  And then later, I just might ask why I have had certain problems in my life and if they could be fixed.  
<br>
<p>In Mormon tradition there is the story of the &quot;three Nephites.&quot;  These were men it is said who had lived in North America, and were visited by Christ after his resurrection.  He granted them the wish of their hearts, which was to be immortal so they could do good on the earth while awaiting his second coming.
<br>
<p>Over the many decades of LDS history, Mormons would say they were helped by strangers who appeared out of nowhere and after the good deed was done, would seem to vanish the moment the person took their eyes away from them.  I actually have a friend whose father swears one such immortal showed up to save his life when as a young missionary he was surrounded by knife wielding gang members in Brazil.                    
<br>
<p>Having read several science fiction novels which got me thinking, I sometimes wonder if a time traveller or shapeshifting alien might check-in to the Creekside Preserve Lodge without me even realizing it.  It would probably be the last person I would ever suspect.
<br>
<p>The odds are probably much higher at an Extro... lol!
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
