<p>Ron, I'm not sure I buy this.  Is this an assertion of what will
<br>
actually happen, what the papers are &quot;selling&quot; to people, or
<br>
conclusions that people have reached independently?
<br>
<p>From an economic standpoint, it may make a certain amount of sense
<br>
for countries to cut back on oil production because when production
<br>
declines the price will increase and they can sell the reserves
<br>
that have been conserved at that much higher price.  So it becomes
<br>
a question of &quot;Do you want less money now or more money later?&quot;
<br>
situation.  (Assuming inflation adjustments on the value of money
<br>
of course.)
<br>
<p>Now, obviously the people are not being educated as to their
<br>
relative wealth in terms of solar energy (vs. the energy under
<br>
their feet) [1].  So a proper development path would be to use
<br>
what is under their feet (which is unsustainable in the long run)
<br>
to develop solar energy resources (which are much more sustainable).
<br>
<p>So this whole &quot;cost a trillion dollars&quot; perspective seems highly
<br>
suspect IMO.
