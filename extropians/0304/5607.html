Spike writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider Joss Palmer in Contact (loooove that movie,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the rare instances where the film was better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the book, better because it has such feeling, rare in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the science fiction genre).  Palmer more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledges that his belief is based on an overwhelming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling that he once had, an emotional experience.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Arroway has her experience with the father-imitating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien, she too realizes that her entire adventure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have been an elaborate hallucination, yet still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she comes to believe that the others are out there.
</em><br>
<p>I think that's why I couldn't stand that movie.  It really
<br>
ended up, IIRC, that for the audience too her experience
<br>
was indistinguishable from hallucination.  When I was a
<br>
kid, I just hated it when at the end of a movie (i.e.
<br>
The Wizard of Oz, or Invaders From Mars) it turns out
<br>
it was all a dream.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted, however I was a good churchman, and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freely admit that I was in many ways a happier person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during those years in which the god-illusion was still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firm.
</em><br>
<p>That's because, underneath it all, Spike, you are a
<br>
good person.
<br>
<p>As for me, the biggest emotion I felt upon becoming an
<br>
atheist at age 17 was relief.  It seemed to be one less
<br>
thing to worry about.  No big Eye in the Sky evaluating
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>Not only the freedom, though, there was also the purity
<br>
of the complete materialist worldview, the single vision
<br>
of the universe as machine.  I think the humor of it also
<br>
appealed to me:  all the noble dreams, all the great 
<br>
aspirations... just atoms after all.  So for good or bad,
<br>
it's atoms we are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Interesting note: perhaps you have heard me mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my favorite book, Goedel Escher Bach, the Eternal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Golden Braid, by Hofstadter.  In 1980 I read in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work about self referencing paradox.  I realized that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the objective truth value of my religious belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system was completely unverifiable since it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely based on self reference.
</em><br>
<p>Well, when I read GEB about the same time, I was, being
<br>
older than you, already a stalwart atheist many times
<br>
over.  Long before then, it was hardly that religion
<br>
was self-referencing (and it is: you must have &quot;faith&quot;
<br>
because you must have faith), it's just that there was
<br>
no room for it in the emerging picture of the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One good objective, non-self-referential piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence was all I asked of religion, and none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be provided, even if I were willing to settle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a hallucination.
</em><br>
<p>For all the fantasizing I do, I'm grateful that even as
<br>
a small child, as far back as I can remember, I always
<br>
understood the difference between fantasy and reality,
<br>
and between appearance and reality.
<br>
