Spike querried:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Spud this is something that has puzzled me.  Why is there
<br>
fear of warmth?  Is it the images of flooded coastline
<br>
from melting icecaps?  Is there genuine concern that
<br>
mankind couldn't deal with a rising sea, given
<br>
hundreds or thousands of years notice?  Or is there
<br>
something else Im not seeing?  Is there concern about
<br>
wild species?  Do we not have an inexhaustible supply
<br>
of species preadapted to warmer climates?  What is
<br>
the big deal if this planet gets warmer?
<br>

<br>
<p>Hi Spike. I suspect that this seems to be a cultural carry-over from 19th 
<br>
century castastrophism. Its also a fear generated by change because change 
<br>
threatens a loss of control. The human animal, including myself, fears a loss 
<br>
of control, and I do not necessarilly mean self-control either. There is also 
<br>
the opposition against technological change, even if its clearly beneficial. 
<br>
People fear that they will be over-run with pests, drowned out, that Florida 
<br>
will disappear, that California will slide in the ocean. People tend to 
<br>
believe that (irrationally) they can freeze time, and society, by 
<br>
automatically resisting change. They have grown comfortable with how things 
<br>
are, and people, most generally, are culturally conservative. 
<br>
<p>Moreover, if all that they hear, for 30 or 40 years is leftist propaganda, 
<br>
irrespective of what the best research indicates; then what can we expect? 
<br>
Similarly, the do-nothing about the environment approach of many industries; 
<br>
also motivates a deserved skepticism; that benefits the liberals and the 
<br>
left. Unfortunately, for the Libs, all they can muster in the way of clean 
<br>
energy tech, are films of windmills and solar cells and never a clear 
<br>
analysis of what is actually produced megawatt-wise; rather then glorified 
<br>
commericials.
