</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With all due respect, one can simply suggest that the scenarios of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mismanagement you forecast &quot;might&quot; not happen, either. But more to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point, I would ask that you clarify your position regarding the &quot;bad job&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we did of occupying Japan after WWII. Last time I checked, Japan has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a stable democracy and free nation since 1952.
</em><br>
<p>My point is that Japan's stable democracy and freedom are not a factor of 
<br>
our leaders being particularly intelligent about the occupation, but 
<br>
happened dispute such things heavy-handed censorship and 
<br>
price-control-induced food shortages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Some highlights of our &quot;bad job&quot; of occupation include the granting of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suffrage to women, with fourteen million of them going to the polls in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;April 1946. In fact, thirty-nine women, including one well-known 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prostitute, were elected to the Diet. Additionally, MacArthur and Yoshida 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put an end to the &quot;absentee landlordism&quot; that so dominated the lives of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Japanese farmers. By 1950, ninety percent of Japanese farmland was owned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by the farmers themselves. Beyond that, MacArthur dismissed over five 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousand officers of Japan's secret police and established habeas corpus. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indeed, a truly dismal record.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Regardless of the missteps that may occur along the way during the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporary occupation, the odds of Iraq becoming a flourishing democracy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afterward are still a thousand times better than those had Saddam Hussein 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and his heirs remained in power.
</em><br>
<p>I couldn't have said it better myself.  Even if one has a bad opinion of 
<br>
the Bush administration's ability to keep its foot out of its mouth, or its 
<br>
ability to remain objectively judicious, it is still likely that a liberal 
<br>
democratic regime might arise.

<em>&gt;&quot;As we were driving on a deserted highway between Oiso and Tokyo, two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American GIs suddenly appeared and signaled my driver to halt. I imagined 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them to be on some kind of marauding expedition, but they turned out to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soldiers returning to Tokyo who had lost their way. I offered to take them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back to Tokyo.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We had not proceeded far before they were pressing chocolates, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chewing gum, and finally cigarettes upon me. I recall thinking at the time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it was the natural way of acting on their part, and the inherent good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature of the average American, which enabled the Occupation of Japan to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be completed without a shot being fired.&quot;

<p>This kind of good did not take any planning by the people in charge, but 
<br>
happened naturally as a consequence of the situation.  This gives me hope 
<br>
that it will happen again in Iraq.
