<p>
This is VAMP news: Information you never see or hear on FOX or CNN.
<br>
VAMP is the sweetest seduction in a world of depressing war news.
<br>
VAMP stands for &quot;Vicious Ambitious Militant Pacifists&quot;.
<br>
VAMP though has absolutely nothing in common with VAMP.
<br>
Because VAMP means &quot;Viscerally Amplified Mutation Pukers&quot;, who take
<br>
advantage of a rapidly developing genetic mutation that spreads around the
<br>
world and allows its carriers to puke regularly at the sight of George Bush,
<br>
Donald Rumsfeld and friendly fire disasters without being weakened to
<br>
life-threatening dimensions.
<br>
<p>VAMP found out that Tommy Franks actually is Mel Gibson on a public relation
<br>
tour through the Arabian countries to promote his new movie &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;.
<br>
This might explain the mishaps and breakdowns of the glorious Anglo-American
<br>
peace crusade so far. Mel Gibson simply doesn't get military things
<br>
straight. But who could expect this from an amateur Hollywood Hero. The
<br>
other day Mel &quot;Tommy&quot; Gibson said: &quot;This war might last until summer&quot;.
<br>
Though Mel was not more explicit what year he was talking about
<br>
<p>In contrast to VAMP, the Mutant Pukers of VAMP claimed that Tommy Franks
<br>
must be Peter Gabriel who cut off his goatee and who is on a Iraq promotion
<br>
tour to feature his new CD &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. This might explain the mishaps
<br>
and breakdowns of the glorious Anglo-American peace crusade so far. Peter
<br>
Gabriel simply doesn't get military things straight. But who could expect
<br>
this from one of those songwriter peacenicks who are all known to be more or
<br>
less hidden fascists.
<br>
<p>In the next VAMP edition please read why the US Secretary of Defense, Donald
<br>
Rumsfeld, was renamed into Secreatry of PUKE (Professional Unlimited Killing
<br>
Experience) and why the contents of the PC (puke containers) in Italy and
<br>
Spain are the most popular sources of lubrication for US tanks. A detailed
<br>
and dreadful report follows.
<br>
<p>Coming soon: the plans of Old Europe to liberate the US people from the
<br>
brutalisation of their society by irresponsible, corrupt and neglected
<br>
politicians.
<br>
<p>Stay tuned to VAMP, the true friend of American patriots!
<br>
<p>PS: If some suspicious van with the inscription VAMP stops at your house,
<br>
open your door wide. They are the &quot;Vicious Amphibicious Malicious
<br>
Pacifishious&quot; and happen to be some harmless freeriders who take advantage
<br>
of VAMP's worldwide fame and just try to sell you some fresh Pacific fish.
