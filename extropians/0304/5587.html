<p>
A wandering, mischievous, and distinctly unFriendly AI sees these two, and 
<br>
decides that it would be fun if he switched their opinions.  Suddenly the 
<br>
intelligent peacnick sees why the invasion is necessary, and the straw 
<br>
warmonger has an attack of conscience.  They become, respectively, WM' and 
<br>
PN', and continue their debate, now on opposite sides.
<br>
<p>PN':  I was so wrong, this war it totally illegal!  Its against the UN charter!
<br>
WM':  How so?  We have resolution 1441 saying that we can invade.
<br>
PN':  Nonsense!  Serious consequences doesn't mean *war*!  It means... well 
<br>
France definitely wouldn't have voted for it if it meant war!  And besides, 
<br>
now the Security Council is &quot;seized of the matter&quot; and so invading is illegal.
<br>
WM':  &lt;smiles&gt; And I suppose that the US voted for resolution 1441 thinking 
<br>
that it would legally prevent them from going to war?  Anyway, how is the 
<br>
Security Council &quot;seized of the matter&quot; now that they are no longer even 
<br>
planning a vote related toe Iraq, much less demanding any action of any party?
<br>
PN':  Never mind!  The point is that one country can't invade another just 
<br>
like that!  We were at peace with Iraq, we can't just suddenly declare war!
<br>
WM':  And how did we achieve peace, given that we never signed a peace treaty?
<br>
PN':  So what!  We have a cease fire!
<br>
WM':  Whose terms resolution 1441 says that Iraq has broken.
<br>
PN':  Even so, we have no evidence that Iraq has any of those weapons.
<br>
WM':  So why won't Iraq offer anything but the most token assistance, and 
<br>
defectors form Iraq consistently say that Iraq is hiding more weapons?
<br>
PN':  Even if they have weapons in violation of the cease fire, we can get 
<br>
rid of them with inspections.
<br>
WM':  And if he just kicks out the inspectors again?
<br>
PN':  Well he let them back in didn't he?  He must have turned over a new leaf.
<br>
WM':  Or maybe it was just the threat of war?
<br>
PN':  In any event he is cooperating now.
<br>
WM':  Will he continue to cooperate when he realizes that we aren't willing 
<br>
to go to war?
<br>
PN':  Moving on, those are all just excuses to go to war, we don't have any 
<br>
good reasons though.
<br>
WM':  Iraq's support of international terrorism?
<br>
PN':  What evidence do we have of that?  None.
<br>
WM':  There is that mockup of a 747 that for terrorists to practice 
<br>
hijacking, and the fact that they give money to the families of suicide 
<br>
bombers.
<br>
PN':  But that isn't necessarily related to Osoma Bin Ladin, who doesn't 
<br>
seem to be showing his face anymore anyway, so that doesn't matter.
<br>
WM':  Even if Saddam can supply nuclear weapons to terrorists?
<br>
PN':  There hasn't ever been any nuclear terrorism yet, so there never will be.
<br>
WM':  And then there is freeing the Iraqi's from a brutal dictatorship.
<br>
PN':  Whoever we put in will be worse, just look at those guys we supported 
<br>
during the Cold War.
<br>
WM':  None were worse than Saddam, and why would we continue to do the same 
<br>
now that the Cold War is over?
<br>
PN':  Even putting in a democracy will be antidemocratic, since the Iraqi's 
<br>
won't have chosen that government.
<br>
WM':  Even if they can change their constitution?
<br>
PN':  Countries are supposed to have revolutions and achieve democracy 
<br>
without any outside help.
<br>
WM':  Like the US did?
<br>
PN':  I still have objections!
<br>
WM':  Go ahead.
<br>
PN':  The US is a bad country and has no right to impose its will abroad.
<br>
WM':  Would you say that bad people shouldn't be allowed to do good deeds?
<br>
PN':  &lt;thinks for a bit&gt; Moving on, we put Saddam where he is now.
<br>
WM':  No we didn't, and even if we did wouldn't that make him our 
<br>
responsibility to remove.
<br>
PN':  But we gave him permission to invade Kuwait!
<br>
WM':  How is telling him that he can solve the problem himself the same as 
<br>
telling him to invade?
<br>
PN':  We should adjudicate all disputes between all other countries just to 
<br>
make sure that this doesn't happen.  And we did sell him weapons.
<br>
WM':  But didn't we sell him less weapons than France or Russia?
<br>
PN':  Doesn't matter, and there are lots of worse countries out there that 
<br>
we should get first, like North Korea.
<br>
WM':  Do you think that China would agree to that?
<br>
PN':  They might but...Our sanctions on Iraq are heartless and cost the 
<br>
lives of tens of thousands of Iraqis each year.
<br>
WM':  If Iraq used the money for food instead of weapons that wouldn't 
<br>
happen, and besides, isn't that an argument *against* the status quo?
<br>
PN':  But people will be killed if we invade Iraq.
<br>
WM':  Yes, but far less than will be killed if we don't.
<br>
PN':  It doesn't matter, if we do something the blood will be on our hands, 
<br>
while if we do nothing we won't be to blame.
<br>
WM':  But any action can unintentionally cause someone's death, so if you 
<br>
believe that, isn't your only moral choice to never take any action?
<br>
PN':  Well, there will be too many civilian deaths.
<br>
WM':  The top of the range of the largest independent count is 724 so 
<br>
far.  Even assuming that 7000 civilians die in this war, it will be less 
<br>
than Iraq's police kill in an average year.
<br>
PN':  We should have offered Saddam a peaceful way out.
<br>
WM':  Like our offer to let him leave?
<br>
PN':  But we'll get Iraq's oil if we win!
<br>
WM':  Won't being able to sell their oil help the Iraqis just as much as us?
<br>
PN':  But that's *why* we're invading!
<br>
WM':  Couldn't we get Iraq's oil by just supporting Saddam?  Why go through 
<br>
this whole &quot;war&quot; thing just to get something Saddam seems perfectly willing 
<br>
to sell?
<br>
PN':  But Bush and Cheney are oilmen!
<br>
WM':  How does that effect the above?
<br>
PN':  But we don't have international support!
<br>
WM':  Have you heard the phrase &quot;coalition of the willing?&quot;
<br>
PN':  But that doesn't include the US's traditional rivals like France or 
<br>
China!
<br>
WM':  Doesn't it have most of Europe though?
<br>
PN':  I know, wasn't it horrid how they just stabbed France in the 
<br>
back.  Europe should be unified.
<br>
WM':  But didn't the majority of European countries vote to support the US?
<br>
PN':  They should be unified behind what France wants!  You're just a 
<br>
bloodthirsty lunatic; I just hope Iraq defeats the US just to take them 
<br>
down a notch.
<br>
WM':  I give up.

<em>&gt;WARMONGER EXPLAINS WAR TO PEACENIK (Author Unknown)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Why did you say we are we invading Iraq?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: We are invading Iraq because it is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     violation of security council resolution 1441.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     A country cannot be allowed to violate security
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     council resolutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But I thought any of our allies, including Israel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     were in violation of more security council
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     resolutions than Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: It's not just about UN resolutions. The main point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     is that Iraq could have weapons of mass destruction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and the first sign of a smoking gun could well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a mushroom cloud over NY.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Mushroom cloud? But I thought the weapons inspectors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     said Iraq had no nuclear weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Yes, but biological and chemical weapons are the issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But I thought Iraq did not have any long range
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     missiles for attacking us or our allies with such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: The risk is not Iraq directly attacking us, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     terrorists networks that Iraq could sell the weapons to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But couldn't virtually any country sell chemical or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     biological materials? We sold quite a bit to Iraq in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     eighties ourselves, didn't we?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: That's ancient history. Look, Saddam Hussein is an evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     man that has an undeniable track record of repressing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     his own people since the early eighties. He gasses his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     enemies. Everyone agrees that he is a power-hungry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     lunatic murderer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: We sold chemical and biological materials to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     power-hungry lunatic murderer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: The issue is not what we sold, but rather what Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     did. He is the one that launched a pre-emptive first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     strike on Kuwait.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: A pre-emptive first strike does sound bad. But didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     our ambassador to Iraq, Gillespie, know about and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     green-light the invasion of Kuwait?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Let's deal with the present, shall we? As of today,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Iraq could sell its biological and chemical weapons to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Al Qaida. Osama BinLaden himself released an audio
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     tape calling on Iraqis to suicide attack us, proving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a partnership between the two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Osama Bin Laden? Wasn't the point of invading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Afghanistan to kill him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Actually, it's not 100% certain that it's really Osama
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Bin Laden on the tapes. But the lesson from the tape
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     is the same: there could easily be a partnership
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein unless we act.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Is this the same audio tape where Osama Bin Laden labels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Saddam a secular infidel?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: You're missing the point by just focusing on the tape.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Powell presented a strong case against Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: He did?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Yes, he showed satellite pictures of an Al Qaeda
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     poison factory in Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But didn't that turn out to be a harmless shack in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     part of Iraq controlled by the Kurdish opposition?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: And a British intelligence report...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Didn't that turn out to be copied from an out-of-date
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     graduate student paper?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: And reports of mobile weapons labs...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Weren't those just artistic renderings?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: And reports of Iraqis scuttling and hiding evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     from inspectors...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Wasn't that evidence contradicted by the chief weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     inspector, Hans Blix?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Yes, but there is plenty of other hard evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     cannot be revealed because it would compromise our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     security.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So there is no publicly available evidence of weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of mass destruction in Iraq?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: The inspectors are not detectives, it's not their JOB
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to find evidence. You're missing the point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So what is the point?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: The main point is that we are invading Iraq because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     resolution 1441 threatened &quot;severe consequences.&quot; If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     do not act, the security council will become an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     irrelevant debating society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So the main point is to uphold the rulings of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     security council?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Absolutely. ...unless it rules against us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: And what if it does rule against us?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: In that case, we must lead a coalition of the willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     invade Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: Coalition of the willing? Who's that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Britain, Turkey, Bulgaria, Spain, and Italy, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     starters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: I thought Turkey refused to help us unless we gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     them tens of billions of dollars
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Nevertheless, they may now be willing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: I thought public opinion in all those countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     was against war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Current public opinion is irrelevant. The majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     expresses its will by electing leaders to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     decisions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So it's the decisions of leaders elected by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     majority that is important?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But George B-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: I mean, we must support the decisions of our leaders,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     however they were elected, because they are acting in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     our best interest. This is about being a patriot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     That's the bottom line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So if we do not support the decisions of the president,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     we are not patriotic?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: I never said that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So what are you saying? Why are we invading Iraq?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: As I said, because there is a chance that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     weapons of mass destruction that threaten us and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     allies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But the inspectors have not been able to find any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     such weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Iraq is obviously hiding them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: You know this? How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Because we know they had the weapons ten years ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and they are still unaccounted for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: The weapons we sold them, you mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Precisely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But I thought those biological and chemical weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     would degrade to an unusable state over ten years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: But there is a chance that some have not degraded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So as long as there is even a small chance that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     such weapons exist, we must invade?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Exactly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But North Korea actually has large amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     usable chemical, biological, AND nuclear weapons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     AND long range missiles that can reach the west
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     coast AND it has expelled nuclear weapons inspectors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     AND threatened to turn America into a sea of fire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: That's a diplomatic issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So why are we invading Iraq instead of using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     diplomacy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Aren't you listening? We are invading Iraq because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     we cannot allow the inspections to drag on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     indefinitely. Iraq has been delaying, deceiving,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and denying for over ten years, and inspections
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     cost us tens of millions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But I thought war would cost us tens of billions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Yes, but this is not about money. This is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     security.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: But wouldn't a pre-emptive war against Iraq ignite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     radical Muslim sentiments against us, and decrease our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     security?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Possibly, but we must not allow the terrorists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     change the way we live. Once we do that, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     terrorists have already won.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So what is the purpose of the Department of Homeland
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Security, color-coded terror alerts, and the Patriot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Act? Don't these change the way we live?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: I thought you had questions about Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: I do. Why are we invading Iraq?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: For the last time, we are invading Iraq because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     world has called on Saddam Hussein to disarm, and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     has failed to do so. He must now face the consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So, likewise, if the world called on us to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     something, such as find a peaceful solution, we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     have an obligation to listen?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: By &quot;world&quot;, I meant the United Nations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Nations?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: By &quot;United Nations&quot; I meant the Security Council.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the Security
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Council?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: I meant the majority of the Security Council.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: So, we have an obligation to listen to the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the Security Council?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Well... there could be an unreasonable veto.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: In which case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: In which case, we have an obligation to ignore the veto.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: And if the majority of the Security Council does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     support us at all?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: Then we have an obligation to ignore the Security
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Council.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: That makes no sense:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;WM: If you love Iraq so much, you should move there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Or maybe France, with the all the other cheese-eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     surrender monkeys. It's time to boycott their wine and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     cheese, no doubt about that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PN: I give up.
</em><br>
<p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
