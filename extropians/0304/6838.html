<em>&gt; The problem with this is that you end up dead, dead, dead.
</em><br>
<p>There may be some confusion here due to my poor wording.  I was arguing
<br>
*for* calorie restriction.  I really meant that the healthiest diet seems to
<br>
be calorie restriction, cutting back as far as possible.  It gets healthier
<br>
and healthier until you cut back too far and suddenly die.  That is, the
<br>
least number of calories we can eat while staying alive is the best.  I said
<br>
&quot;may&quot; because it is experimental and not completely proven, but it does seem
<br>
pretty persuasive to me.
<br>
<p>What I was calling &quot;radical or experimental&quot; was not CR, but diets that
<br>
eliminate an entire food group (such as carbs or fats) and completely
<br>
changes the body chemistry.  For example, the Atkins diet eliminates all
<br>
carbs but then proponents claim you can eat all the fats and protein you
<br>
want.  This violates CR and PR, and may reduce longevity in the long run.
<br>
While I applaud cutting down on bad carbs, I cringe at eating a lot of bad
<br>
fats.  My point was that we should try to restrict all calories across the
<br>
board and not focus on just eliminating one group.  When I described my
<br>
personal diet, it was not meant to say it was best.  I was confessing that I
<br>
am only moderately restricting calories compared to more extreme measures
<br>
that might be too difficult for me (especially on the road all the time).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So -- one needs to make decisions as to whether one wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe the &quot;theories&quot; and act on them.  If one waits for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;proof&quot; it may arrive too late.
</em><br>
<p>This was not my intent here.  Although I am paranoid about my health, and
<br>
don't take what I consider to be unnecessary chances, I am experimenting
<br>
with myself without waiting for definitive proof.  I think I have enough
<br>
evidence for my needs.  I am a vegetarian (as an easy means to avoid
<br>
cholesterol, avoid saturated fats, reduce total fats, reduce complete
<br>
proteins, increase incomplete proteins, increase fiber, increase
<br>
antioxidants, increase phytochemicals, etc.).  I take high doses of
<br>
life-extension nutrients and antioxidants.  I take a few non-nutrient
<br>
chemicals that I think help.
