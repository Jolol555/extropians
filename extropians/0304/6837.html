</em><br>
<em>&gt; war was put to the vote of all the people but this is not the 
</em><br>

<p>Gee, that's a toughie.  It sounds like you did everything you
<br>
could.  One big problem---that even a mobocracy vote wouldn't
<br>
have helped---was that a majority of people were for the war.
<br>
<p>One solution is to just let other people around the world
<br>
vote too.  Why should decisions by the American government
<br>
be influenced only by American voters?  Sounds rather unfair.
<br>
<p>But even then, on many issues the vote could still go against
<br>
you.  That is, no matter how much you marched, no matter how much
<br>
civil disobedience, the majority might continue to stubbornly
<br>
persist in an incorrect opinion.  Have you studied Lenin?  He
<br>
had a solution.  You mobilize the vanguard of the people (you
<br>
and the marchers), and then you get your way like he did.
<br>
Sometimes the masses just have to be led by those who see
<br>
more clearly, that's all.
