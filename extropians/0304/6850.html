Dr. Damien Broderick's madrigal did singeth:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Oh Momma, could this really be the Spike, to be stuck here in a Polis,
<br>
on the Tethys Sea, again! Time for mah boot heels to be wanderin'.
<br>
Damien Dylan Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Gee, That was Positively 4th Street!
<br>
Here is a rip-off of an Al Stewart song, that I re-lyricized to appear more 
<br>
Extropian, following Mr. Spike66's lead.
<br>
<p>Oh you slipped away from the harbour side
<br>
In the morning bright and clear
<br>
And your sails were filled with the solar wind
<br>
And you laughed for all to hear
<br>
But you never glanced at the ragged dance
<br>
Of the others on the quay
<br>
Don't call on them when the winds rise high
<br>
On the dark interstellart sea
<br>
<p>Oh you set your course for the furthest shores
<br>
And you never once looked back
<br>
And the flag you flew was a pirate cross
<br>
On a field of velvet black
<br>
And those landsmen who you but lately knew
<br>
Were left stranded on Kuiper ring B
<br>
Don't call on them, when the Vacuum Storms rise up
<br>
On the dark interstellar sea
<br>
<p>Oh I have no need of a chart or creed
<br>
You told your waiting crew
<br>
For the winds of chance, they will bear us straight
<br>
And you spoke as though you knew
<br>
So you paid no mind to the warning signs
<br>
As you gave your words so free
<br>
Don't change your tack when the photons crack
<br>
On the dark interstellar sea
<br>
<p>Now the neutrinos rail in the great mainsails
<br>
And the stars desert the skies
<br>
And the rigging strains as the hands of pain
<br>
Reach down to wash your eyes
<br>
And your navigator stands with her torch in hand
<br>
And her eyes spell mutiny
<br>
Don't call my name when your ship goes down
<br>
On the dark interstellar sea
<br>
<p><p>-The Dark and the Rolling Sea, as Butchered by me!
