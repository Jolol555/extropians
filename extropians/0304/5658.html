Does not follow.  God could be the framework, or could be outside the 
<br>
framework, or whatever it is the theologians insist on.  The only 
<br>
requirement for consilience is that the explanation be consistent. 
<br>
Physics is consilient with biology, for example, and physics is not a 
<br>
lifeform among other lifeforms.

Indeed it does not follow; God could intervene without needing to be
part of the universe.
However, as He is attributed omnipotence, all hoops are fair game.
Hmm, psychoanalysts might have a field day with that last sentence.
Luckily they are all full of shit anyway (anal retentive?) so I don't
care :-)
