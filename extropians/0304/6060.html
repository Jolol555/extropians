<p>Well, I want to know, then:  Would you support a U.S. led invasion
<br>
of Cuba tomorrow?  Do you personally think that the coalition forces
<br>
should next invade North Korea?   If not, then aren't you being a
<br>
bit disingenuous here?
<br>
<p>Not only that, but you saw how murderously difficult it was to get
<br>
political support in the U.S., England, and Australia even to
<br>
take out Saddam Hussein---twelve years of resolutions and sanctions
<br>
(at 5000 children a month dying from the sanctions?  or was that
<br>
just propaganda?).  Yet despite ease of operations in that 
<br>
country for a Western power, and despite the wickedness of his
<br>
regime, without 9-11 it would not have been politically possible.
<br>
<p>If you think that the &quot;war&quot; protestors, or the Democrats in the U.S.
<br>
got agitated over attacking Saddam's regime, just think about
<br>
how bent out of shape they'd be if someone mentioned attacking
<br>
Castro!   Or North Korea!
