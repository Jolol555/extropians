</em><br>
<p>No, the West thought it was fighting for its life.  After 1991 it became clear
<br>
the Soviet Union was a paper tiger.  Okay, a paper tiger with nukes, but its
<br>
economic power had been vastly overestimated.
<br>
<p>And there wasn't that much fighting, more jockeying for status and influence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The choice, as Max Plumm has eloquently explained, was never

<em>&gt; totalitarianism&quot; in those places.  It's still an open
</em><br>
<p>I consider that unproven.  Greece wandered between democracy and
<br>
authoritarianism.  Costa Rica has been democratic for a long long time.  The
<br>
rest of Latin America was having trouble with democracy since long before
<br>
Communism; it's not clear what the latter had to do with anything.  Apart from
<br>
us helping to overthrow democratically elected left-leaning governments such
<br>
as Allende.
<br>
<p>Oh, India's another counterexample.  Definitely still developing, but
<br>
democratic since independence, and leading the Nonaligned Bloc.  Or Iran,
<br>
which after 1979 was neither pro-US authoritarian nor pro-Soviet totalitarian.
<br>
Maybe getting some aid from the USSR, but mostly going its own theocratic way.
<br>
<p>Lebanon was roughly democratic until the Syrians moved in, and possibly
<br>
Israel's interference didn't help either.
<br>
<p>I now consider the dichtomy not just unproven but rather dubious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's suppose that the neo-cons get their way in the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few U.S. elections, and that after Iraq, other anti-Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyrannical regimes are also subjugated.  Moreover, along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the worst fears of many, let's suppose that American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hegemony in the world continues to grow.  What is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability in this case that the corruption of which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak will develop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will it be different from 1945?  It is not thought that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S., in most areas of the world the single superpower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really got out of control then.  Frankly, unless there is a

<p>The US then didn't talk about empire, and probably didn't believe in it.  The
<br>
neocons talk about Pax Americana and making sure US supremacy is unchallenged
<br>
and unchallengeable.  Which, given the wealth of the EU and the size and
<br>
growing wealth of China, might take some maintenance.  There's a difference
<br>
between hegemony which falls into our lap and hegemony pursued as a goal in
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>What if a democratic country in the middle east, alarmed by repeated US
<br>
invasions of countries it doesn't like, decides to not sell oil to us?  Would
<br>
you consider a re-invasion to get the oil flowing corrupt?
<br>
<p>And you talk about regimes being subjugated, a bit after you said it was an
<br>
open question whether Iraq could support democracy.  Suppose it and other
<br>
countries can't, so the US gets associated with setting up a whole bunch of
<br>
authoritarian regimes.  We may say &quot;look, it's not as bad as what you had.&quot;
<br>
The natives will just see that they now have someone outside to blame for
<br>
their misery.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; big change in the nature of the American people, I can't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the United States will become aggressive or imperial any
</em><br>
<p>If the neocons get their way for the next few elections I think you'll see a
<br>
much more imperial US; that's the way they want.  A solid presence in the
<br>
Middle East, ability to intimidate other countries there, bases everywhere.
<br>
<p>And what of democracy at home while this is going on?  Eroding civil
<br>
liberties, eroding abortion rights, increasing governmental religiosity and
<br>
secrecy... I'm just describing trends of the past two years, here.
<br>
Paranoid would be worrying about further expansion of the idea of declaring US
<br>
citizens &quot;enemy combatants&quot; to be held without due process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; challenge:  in what ways has U.S. economic and military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hegemony during the last *fifteen* years resulted in anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian tendencies?
</em><br>
<p>Interference with family planning.  Secret WTO tribunals overturning local
<br>
laws.  Trying to prevent the International Criminal Court from taking shape.
<br>
Supporting Israel's military occupation of a few million people.  Either
<br>
trading with China or failing to trade with Cuba; one of those has to be
<br>
wrong, although I don't know which.  Pushing the war on drugs.
