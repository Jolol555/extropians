<p><p>&lt;&lt;The technology, called Solarec, uses a system of mirrors to harness and 
<br>
concentrate the power of the sun to crack water molecules, thereby releasing the 
<br>
hydrogen. Unlike typical systems for deriving hydrogen, RECO's system at no 
<br>
point relies on fossil fuels, thus eliminating one of the fundamental flaws of 
<br>
the much-discussed fuel-cell industry -- the release into the atmosphere of 
<br>
carbon dioxide, which some believe contributes to global warming. And its 
<br>
efficiency begins to bring hydrogen production in line with other energy sources.
<br>
        &quot;This makes honest people out of the hydrogen folks,&quot; says Reed 
<br>
Jensen, a former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist who founded the 
<br>
four-person company in 1988 in this suburb of Los Alamos.
<br>
        RECO is three weeks away from a second working prototype that Jensen 
<br>
says could lead to commercial sales as a complete energy production system, 
<br>
which not only produces hydrogen for use in fuel cells, but taps off the excess 
<br>
heat energy to run an electricity-producing steam turbine.
<br>
        &quot;[It] can be used as a complete power source,&quot; he says.
<br>
        Hydrogen is the most prevalent element in the universe. Called the 
<br>
&quot;forever fuel&quot; by some proponents of alternative energy, some scientists say it 
<br>
stores energy more effectively than conventional batteries, and it burns twice 
<br>
as efficiently in a fuel cell as gasoline in a regular internal combustion 
<br>
engine. A fuel cell's only byproducts are oxygen and heat. International events 
<br>
of the last couple of years have demonstrated the United States' shaky 
<br>
relationship with the Middle East, the source of most of the world's oil. Moreover, 
<br>
pollution concerns and the knowledge that fossil fuel production cannot be 
<br>
sustained indefinitely, at current levels, have brought a new urgency to the 
<br>
development of hydrogen as an alternative. Some predict a 10-fold increase in 
<br>
hydrogen's use as a fuel over the next two decades...&gt;&gt;
