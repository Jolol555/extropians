Looking through the website, I was stuck with how poorly they seem to 
<br>
articulate what it is exactly they are proposing/practicing.
<br>
<p>Also, I see a lot of talk about non-coercion, yet very little tangible 
<br>
strategy for dealing with the myriad of problems that would arise.  My 
<br>
understanding is that most children are simply not equiped to deal with a 
<br>
situation where no framework of reasonable discipline is applied.
<br>
<p>I don't trust some adults to make &quot;adult&quot; decisions.  I'd trust most 
<br>
children even less.  How does this system equip children for a world in 
<br>
which no matter how much they say they won't be &quot;coerced&quot;, they have to 
<br>
cooperate to achieve their aims?  What would they do where cooperation or 
<br>
compromise are not possible?
<br>
<p>It'd be interesting to see what sorts of people these children 
<br>
become.  Wouldn't fancy potty training them, though.

<em>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/</a>, dedicated to the principle that &quot;it is

<em>&gt; &gt;possible and desirable to bring up children entirely without doing things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to them against their will, or making them do things against their will,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and that they are entitled to the same rights, respect and control over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their lives as adults.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I found this site quite interesting. I was surprised at the degree to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which they are able to use a Popperian approach to conclude that popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dogmas about children are cruel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I generally agree that children should be treated as rational beings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that disagreements between adults and children should cause us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspect a disagreement in goals rather than that the children are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foolish and need to have the adults' opinions forced on them.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;is particularly amusing: &quot;Look for the following DANGER SIGNS that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may indicate your child has been using religion&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But I'm unconvinced by the TCS claims about what obligations parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have towards their children, as illustrated by this attitude towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt;carnivorous children:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The vegetarian who believes that meat eating ought to be legal ought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to buy it for their child and give them the respect they would give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another human being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I didn't see any argument that this view is better than the more standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view that the parental payment for the food gives them substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;authority to influence what their children eat, just as it would if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were feeding adult friends. Did anyone see an argument that I missed?
