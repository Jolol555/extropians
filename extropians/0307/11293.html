</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even including the gross fractures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; care about &quot;fractures&quot; or &quot;damage&quot; - tell me what happens to the

<em>&gt; configuration space.
</em><br>
<p>### We cannot at present adequately describe the configuration space of the
<br>
system in question, but we can make educated guesses. We know that spatial
<br>
proximity is important for synaptic function. We also know that many types
<br>
of mechanical damage result in the loss of positional information, that is,
<br>
without being able to trace the trajectories of objects as the damage
<br>
occurs, it is impossible to reliably back-compute the original
<br>
configuration. Therefore we can make the assumption that a piece of tissue
<br>
without mechanical disruption will be, all else being equal, closer to the
<br>
original configuration than a visibly damaged one, and at the very least,
<br>
recovering function will require fewer computational steps.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### You are correct to look at the problem from the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; theory point of view, but the specific application of your reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is IMO inappropriate - freezing does much more damage in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information loss (just a guess, prompted by looking at fresh-frozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; brain sections)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can you guess this by looking at slides?  You can sever a neuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and half and what matters is not that it has been torn in half, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the jagged edges uniquely identify the other piece of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puzzle.  This I would expect them to do.
</em><br>
<p>### Well, this is just an intuition, but I expect the puzzle to be
<br>
difficult. Looking at the flash-frozen tissue you have more than one
<br>
neuron - you have literally thousands of synapses and hundreds of processes
<br>
interrupted by every single ice crystal (it looks a bit like the holy-est
<br>
part of Swiss cheese). Minute differences in the diffusion of water during
<br>
freezing will shift the loose ends by microns, and to compute back to
<br>
pre-freezing state you might need to model the diffusion during every ice
<br>
crystal formation. To do that, you need to have a very good picture of
<br>
concentrations of ions and proteins in the frozen tissue, *and* in the
<br>
microenvironment before freezing. Maybe it is computationally tractable, but
<br>
I would prefer not have my reanimation depend on this issue, especially
<br>
since vitrification really doesn't add that much time to the procedure,
<br>
compared to what we know the tissue can last after death.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; If dendrites and axons retract into the cell body within half an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; hour after the neuron has been starved of oxygen (!!!),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### This is not true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I've got it wrong.  What's the correct time?
</em><br>
<p>### On autopsy tissues you can see nice undamaged neurons even if fixation
<br>
was performed 24 hours after death. There is rather quick loss of synaptic
<br>
boutons during warm ischemia, but once the tissue cools down to ambient you
<br>
should have no less than 12 hours and perhaps as much as 24 hours for
<br>
getting good slides. You will see some mitochondrial swelling within 20
<br>
minutes after death, but this is irrelevant to reconstruction of neural
<br>
networks.
