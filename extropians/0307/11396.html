</em><br>
<p>I have agreed several times that the mere inconsistency does not by itself 
<br>
imply what people &quot;really&quot; want.  I agree again now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... when you start telling me that people do not really want what they say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they want, I become worried for several reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One, you're assuming that wanting-ness is a simple natural category, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distracts attention away from the task of arriving at a functional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decomposition of decision-making into a surprisingly weird evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;layer-cake with human icing on top.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't your claim that people do want what they say they want assume just 
<br>
as much simplicity of a natural category?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Two, you're setting off people's cheater-detectors in a way that invokes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an implicit theory of mind that I think is oversimplified, false-to-fact, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and carves the mind at the wrong joints; ...
</em><br>
<p>I hope you are not blaming me for people's cheater-detectors having the 
<br>
wrong implicit theory of mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Three, you're making a preemptive philosophical judgment ...
</em><br>
<p>I'm making a judgement, but I'm not sure what you mean it is &quot;pre&quot; to.  It 
<br>
is post consideration of many issues, but surely pre to more consideration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Four ... Congratulating yourself on a tough-minded view of human nature 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... it is *not*, historically speaking, a reliable heuristic.  Now you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plan to tell people that nobody really cares about altruism, and that all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idealism is a lie and a patina.  I think this is just as damaging as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;telling people that the only possible rational action is to defect on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(iterated!) Prisoner's Dilemma. ... if it were true, I would tell you to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;go ahead and report it no matter the consequences. ...
</em><br>
<p>I said from the start that under my hypothesis self-discovery about our 
<br>
self-deceptions may not be good for people (given what they really want) 
<br>
and that evolution has built us to avoid it.  I have not embarked on a 
<br>
publicity campaign here; I am having a discussion among a few colleagues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Five, there's no good reason to mess with points 1-4 - they are totally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extraneous to the real substance of your theory.  You can declare yourself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be studying &quot;adaptive gross inconsistencies in moral belief and real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions&quot;, and get the benefit of intersection with both evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;psychology and experimental psychology, without ever needing to take a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stance about what people &quot;really&quot; &quot;want&quot;, or presuming a particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functional decomposition of the mechanisms involved.  Modularize away 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those contrarian points...
</em><br>
<p>I agree we can consider these issues separately, but I am really interested 
<br>
in what people really want; it is basic to normative analysis, which 
<br>
economists do a lot of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;... We've seen how people behave if briefly informed.   We haven't seen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;your ideal of fully informed post-upheaval choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When have we seen how people behave if briefly informed?  How can you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;briefly inform someone of something they don't believe to be true?
</em><br>
<p>For example, in the area of disagreement, we can see how people respond to 
<br>
being privately persuaded that persistent disagreement is irrational - they 
<br>
continue to disagree.  We can see that people who are privately informed 
<br>
that they probably over-estimate their own abilities soon continue to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;...  There are huge and long traditions in economics and philosophy, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;among other places, discussing how to describe what people &quot;really&quot; want.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... I have to say that I was not surprised by my brief survey - it looks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty much like what I expected.  Is there any particular area or result 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of which you worry I am ignorant?
</em><br>
<p>In economics it goes by the name of &quot;social welfare analysis&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... For example, if I present people with an explicit choice *apparent to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the subject* of being moral or appearing moral, I would guess that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would choose being moral, as they would be unable to do otherwise and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;retain their self-respect.  On the other hand, the more distant the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dilemma from conscious perception in those terms, the more I would expect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution's puppet strings to have opportunities to take over. ...
</em><br>
<p>I think we can agree here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;People die saving unrelated children.  Is that a lie?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;That is a pretty rare phenomena.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...  The mechanisms of true altruism are, in fact, there, operating as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;independently executing adaptations, and can be exposed given the right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context.
</em><br>
<p>This conclusion seems a bit of a leap from the mere rare phenomena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But if I had a genie built using your definition of &quot;wanting&quot;, I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never, ever make a wish to it.
</em><br>
<p>You would apparently also not wish for it to make you happy, or to make the 
<br>
choice you would make if you were privately informed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Corporations, and other organizations can have behavior that is very much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;like individual self-deception.  So its too bad that you reject such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;examples, as they are much easier to analyze.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Er... it looks to me like they're easy to analyze because they're simpler 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yet unrelated phenomena, i.e., deliberate deception rather than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-deception.  Why would anyone construe it otherwise?
</em><br>
<p>I had in mind examples that look much less like deliberate deception.  A 
<br>
corporation (or non-profit org) can start out with principles that it 
<br>
declares, and that the top individuals in it believe it follows, but market 
<br>
selection pressures can end up making it violate those principles.  It 
<br>
might be company policy not to pollute, or to always tell the costumer the 
<br>
truth, but the company may not give individual employees the incentive to 
<br>
follow those policies.  Those low level employees may engage in deliberate 
<br>
deception, but the corporation as a whole is may be better described as 
<br>
engaging in self-deception.  The CEO may not realize that the incentives 
<br>
are off, but that is because he has not paid sufficient attention to such 
<br>
issues.  Each person may think it is someone else's job to deal with that 
<br>
problem.  And the corporate PR department may be even less away of 
<br>
incentive issues than most parts of the company.
