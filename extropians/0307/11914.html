<p>Hey you, this is a *serious* subject!  We are talking no
<br>
less than about how creatures will spend all of infinity!
<br>
<p>8^D
<br>
<p>Now, I myself happen to want to know EVERYTHING about
<br>
chemistry, exactly how to calculate the entropy content
<br>
of *any* given crystalline form, want to know EVERYTHING
<br>
about Ramsey numbers, prime pairs, and (Spike save me)
<br>
want to know (I confess) everything about Mersenne primes
<br>
and exactly why the Lucas test works, how the Roman forum
<br>
was laid out with respect to the rest of the ancient city,
<br>
and so on and on and on.
<br>
<p>Why?  Why you ask?  I can only say that it is because at
<br>
the current moment my brain is working well, and I am
<br>
capable of deriving vast satisfaction from understanding.
<br>
&quot;To delight in understanding&quot; is the operant phrase.
<br>
<p>Next week, the chemicals in my brain may not be so fortuitously
<br>
composed, and alas, (as happens too frequently) I shall be cast
<br>
downward into a pit of despair in which all life seems meaningless.
<br>
But even so (I will *never* forget) that is a lie, and where there
<br>
is energy and intelligence, there can be happiness---it's only
<br>
a matter of obtaining the right configurations.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, I want to know EVERYTHING, and cannot imagine any of
<br>
our intellectual descendants being satisfied with anything less.
<br>
Compared to them, I'll wager, my most extreme lusts for
<br>
understanding are paltry indeed.  That's why they'll take over
<br>
the universe, and almost desperately make copies of themselves
<br>
and coerce all matter to support calculation---and MORE than
<br>
mere calculation: wonderful wonderful wonderful experience.
<br>
<p>Okay:  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...What's the difference?  :  )
</em><br>
<p>Here are the differences, and there are many more than the
<br>
paltry few listed here:
<br>
<p>1. Mathematics is the final frontier of knowledge, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only thing about which we know contains endless vistas
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of new information.
<br>
<p>2. Gratification research is (or will be) an ongoing 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engineering and architecture problem:  how may we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as matter experience a maximum of gratification---
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is, joy, fulfillment, ecstasy, happiness,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfaction, gratification of every kind, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contentment.
<br>
<p>3. The search for mathematical truth is at least as old
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as ancient Egypt.  But so far as I know, the field of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*gratification research*, or at least the term, was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only coined by me about 1990.  David Pearce's masterful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;essay &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot;, although a deep and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult read, articulates to a fantastic degree what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many others of us only have vaguely felt.  One must
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;realize that next to cryonics, www.hedweb.com is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most revolutionary and salutary movement ever.
<br>
<p>So your quip &quot;What's the difference?&quot;, while it may convey
<br>
accurately the fleeting (or hopefully persistent) enthusiasms
<br>
of the true math freak, they defiantly are not the same thing!  ;-)
<br>
