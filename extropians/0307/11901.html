<p>### I remember reading about an experiment on the growth of a colony of mice
<br>
in a limited space. The mice were given food ad libitum, and were otherwise
<br>
cared for as usual, except that their offspring was not transferred out of
<br>
the cage. There were also no predators or parasites to interfere. After a
<br>
few generations of exponential growth the mice became too crowded for the
<br>
young too allow normal sexual maturation (this effect was presumably
<br>
mediated by the stress or high concentrations of pheromones). Yet, the
<br>
parent generation still bred, increasing crowding even further. After some
<br>
time, all the parental generation mice became infertile with aging, and died
<br>
out, leaving exclusively infertile mice, still quite crowded. After a few
<br>
more months all of them died.
<br>
<p>In this case the evolved adaptations didn't catch up with the dramatic
<br>
change in the environment, and resulted in death by overpopulation. Now, we
<br>
can imagine many scenarios for the future, some of which might actually
<br>
require the removal of the individual urge to procreate, in order to prevent
<br>
catastrophic events. Let's say that a reliable modeling method predicts that
<br>
the existence of more than N independent volitional systems (minds with
<br>
independent, self-modifiable goals) within a volume of space inevitably
<br>
results in a destructive chain reaction of internecine warfare. In that
<br>
case, a coalition of minds might form, perhaps aided by techniques for
<br>
assuring transparency of motives, to keep the population below N, perhaps a
<br>
very low number, much less than the physical carrying capacity of the
<br>
substrate. If the coalition fails, all minds die like stupid mice. This
<br>
could be a situation where population stabilizes, because of objective,
<br>
internal limitations on the stability of societies, perhaps imposed by
<br>
constraints on information processing abilities achievable in this universe.
<br>
<p>I don't think this is the case, I tend to think that expansion and
<br>
proliferation will be decisive for successful survival at superhuman levels
<br>
of intelligence as well, but one never knows.
