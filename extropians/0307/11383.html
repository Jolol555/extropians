</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [ &gt; Dunking usually consisted of a mob of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10-20 or so chasing the 1st year students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around until exhaustion set in, grabbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the nearest one, and flinging him bodily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into the stream. On occasion (for the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bonus points) they'd manage to get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; swans riled up and watch the hapless child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get pecked and chased.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then the apple fights of course. Good fun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when a teacher took one full force in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; side of the head.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you mind saying more about where and when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; were in school? And---if you would---I mean exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; where. This is all getting stranger and stranger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The school was Moyle Park in Clondalkin village, a suburb of Dublin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; City. I was there from 1985 to 1990.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oh, well, that explains it. The Irish are well known
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for their rowdiness and bellicosity. I imagine that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to this day the typical Irish lad has been in a dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fights in as many years. &quot;You'll get a broken airme
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you say that to me agin.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Probably so, although I was something of a freak in that regard, avoiding 
<br>
physical conflicts like the plague.  Odd really, given that the Corballys 
<br>
in general are blessed/cursed with a very rapidly built, hot burning temper 
<br>
that can disappear just as quickly as it sparked.  They are easily capable 
<br>
of extreme violence also.
<br>
<p>You had to be tough in a boys school here, moreso in Primary level 
<br>
education I found.  I in fact had to leave one school due to 
<br>
bullying.  When they weren't bullying others, they typically turned on each 
<br>
other outside school.  I remember one of my antagonists was tied to a horse 
<br>
and left to be dragged around a local park (1983 or thereabouts).  He never 
<br>
named names, of course.  He was later expelled for something or other, last 
<br>
I heard.
<br>
<p>Strangely though, these last few years I'm not nearly as &quot;timid&quot; as I would 
<br>
have been when I was younger.  Not that I've been getting into fisticuffs 
<br>
or any such thing - apart from the St. Patrick's Day incident (I have a 
<br>
very short fuse for trespassers).  I guess that's what happens when you get 
<br>
old, or become a homeowner :) Anyways, back on topic...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that most of me are growing up in parallel worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; quite unlike this, where people behaved themselves the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; we did in southern California in the fifties and sixties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; From what I've been told, the 60s schooling here seemed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to consist of avoiding cruel teachers and the beatings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, that is what I am aiming to find out. I repeat,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in southern California (and, as well as memory permits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;western Nebraska), everyone appeared to behave themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather nicely. You'd *never* have a gang throw anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into a river, or strike an adult with an apple.
</em><br>
<p>In fairness, it was more a case of the adults inadvertently getting in the 
<br>
way of the intended target.  Line of fire and all that.  Let's not forget 
<br>
gang wedgying either.  Or the pile-up (a classic, that one.  Not for the 
<br>
claustrophobic though)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and/or buggery of the Christian Brothers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Okay, well, only a small minority---EVEN WITHIN the Catholic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;schools, I believe---ever had to put up with that.
</em><br>
<p>True, although compounded by the Governments &quot;hands off&quot; attitudes to 
<br>
schools and timidity in dealing forcefully with the Church.
<br>
<p>It must be said of the Order who ran my school (Marist Brothers) that they 
<br>
proved to be decent, fair and honourable men all round.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to confine the discussion to typical behavior over geography.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>More information than I'm sure you cared to receive, but there you go :)
<br>
<p>Basically, we were boys.
