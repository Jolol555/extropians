<p>I have said this to you many time, Mike:  Start your own organization.  If 
<br>
you can do it better than anyone else, then do it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; But I'm not going to state here what my plans are at this time.

<p>No, it is not par for the course.
<br>
<p>You just went to a meeting where you were inspired to pursue your 
<br>
activistic yearnings and now you are blaming me for there not being an 
<br>
outlet for you to be an activist.  I am not the person to be blaming.  The 
<br>
fact that I did not pass on the baton for Pro-Act is (1) no one qualified 
<br>
to take it on emailed me asking to help out; (2) I could not think of any 
<br>
one person who was objective enough to take it on; (3) I was not sure if 
<br>
Pro-Act was indeed the right direction to go in with dealing with the 
<br>
current political and social global anti-biotechnology leanings.
<br>
<p>While Pro-Act was timely and could have been an effective activist 
<br>
organization for warding off the luddites, in hindsight it was not the 
<br>
direction I think best uses our extropic transhumanist ideas.  Instead of 
<br>
fighting the opposition, it is might be more meaningful to communicate with 
<br>
the opposition.  After so much name calling between the transhumanist 
<br>
organizations - Socialist, Libertarian, libertarian, Democratic, Marxist, 
<br>
Facist, Republican, etc. et al., it seemed that moving beyond the obvious 
<br>
politicalized transhumanist sentiment is a better way of dealing with how 
<br>
people &quot;think.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am more interested in the architecture of how people think and the 
<br>
&quot;design&quot; of changing thinking than I am &quot;fighting&quot; the opposition.  We may 
<br>
never change the way a many in the Greenpeace community or the Rifkin 
<br>
community, or the Leon Cass community, but we can design ways that will 
<br>
help people communicate about the problems more effectively.
<br>
<p>In the latest newsletter I asked people to comment.  That would have been a 
<br>
great opportunity to you to communicate with me about what we are doing.
