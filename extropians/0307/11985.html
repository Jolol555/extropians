Ramez writes

<p><em>&gt; &gt; The question is, how accurate is his worry that by \&quot;playing              
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; along\&quot; with the system for two more years, he will compromise            
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his own resistance?                                                       
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely this is a judgment call based on the strength of conviction of       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual and just how large the gap is between his beliefs and        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beliefs he would pretend at.                                            
</em><br>
<p>Yes, sounds right.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Also depends on how skilled this protagonist is at prevarication. IE -    
<br>
can he                                                                        
<br>
lie like a rug? (also see below)                                              
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think a good place to search for past examples of this is in              
</em><br>
<em>&gt; espionage.  What little I know of the field leads me to believe that a      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great many spies have been in \&quot;deep cover\&quot; for years at a time without    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switching allegiances.  Or at least, that's how it is in the spy            
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movies and books. :)                                                        
</em><br>
<p>Ah, great!  The *perfect* analogy---completely lighting up                    
<br>
the whole inquiry.  I think you've settled it!  Thanks.                       
<br>
<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Sorry, gotta disagree. There are SOME similarities, but I have to agree   
<br>
with Randall's earlier post that there're some critical differences between a 
<br>
trained agent provocateur with a support mechanism, a person in this          
<br>
fictional                                                                     
<br>
position, and the subjects of brainwashing efforts.                           
<br>
<p>A trained agent is given information about the situation that the other two   
<br>
lack -                                                                        
<br>
how to deal with the so-called Stockholm Syndrome aka capture bonding, they   
<br>
are generally well-balanced professionals with a professional listener        
<br>
working                                                                       
<br>
with them - their &quot;controller&quot; in spy-fiction terms - and are often           
<br>
ideologically                                                                 
<br>
prepared or selected for proper ideological structure. Even so, there are     
<br>
stories                                                                       
<br>
of people 'going native' or cracking under the stress of such a prolonged     
<br>
mental                                                                        
<br>
and emotional effort.                                                         
<br>
<p>The fictional example is quite different. This person has no special          
<br>
training, no                                                                  
<br>
safe way to vent, is under an even greater level of stress, has a strong      
<br>
moral                                                                         
<br>
conflict (I hate 'em, they control me - yet they prevent lots of nastiness),  
<br>
etc.                                                                          
<br>
Quite frankly, unless this person had an absolutely inhuman degree of self    
<br>
control,                                                                      
<br>
I don't rate their ability to evade detection very highly. This would change  
<br>
if the                                                                        
<br>
person could find some one or ones who have the same knowledge they can share 
<br>
and vent with - but this also increases the stress, worry about betrayal,     
<br>
etc.                                                                          
<br>
<p>The kids, however, do NOT have a strong motivation other than those provided  
<br>
by                                                                            
<br>
the staff. They do NOT have high degrees of acting/lying skill. They do NOT   
<br>
have                                                                          
<br>
anywhere to vent to except by increasing the pressure on others in the        
<br>
program.                                                                      
<br>
They do NOT have a strong core of personal values - they're still working on  
<br>
'em,                                                                          
<br>
and that one 'record-holding' girl is the exception which proves the point,   
<br>
and even                                                                      
<br>
SHE folded in the end. Poor kid!
