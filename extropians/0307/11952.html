</em><br>
<p>This is easily defused -- if cryonic suspension were &quot;mass produced&quot;
<br>
the cost would be *much* lower (someone with cryonet connections should
<br>
post a comment over there to see how low the costs could be driven).
<br>
It seems the cost of supporting an individual in a cryonics stasis
<br>
state ought to be cheaper than supporting an individual in retirement
<br>
collecting a pension from the state  (no need for food, only a
<br>
much smaller &quot;apartment&quot; required, etc.)
<br>
<p>[I know -- this leads to the argument that states should support
<br>
&quot;retiring&quot; people into cryonic suspension until such time as we
<br>
have robust and the cost issues are diminished.)
<br>
<p>It would appear that states with significantly declining young
<br>
populations and increasing elderly populations (e.g. esp. Europe
<br>
and Japan) ought to be seriously supporting cryonics as a way out
<br>
of the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea that cryonics may make sense, but that people will still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay for it individually, is relatively alien, as all differentiated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to medicine has been abolished in France [snip]
</em><br>
<p>Again, this ignores the cost reductions that would be present
<br>
with the &quot;mass production&quot; of cryonics stasis.  Someone (spike?)
<br>
should calculate what the LN2 costs would be to keep a body
<br>
frozen in a dewar on an annual basis assuming everything were
<br>
automated.  The costs should be even lower in France since they
<br>
have all those nuclear reactors to produce the required energy.
<br>
[And we all know that Russia and the U.S. are not exactly short
<br>
on fuel for those reactors...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So people instantly visualize &quot;cryonics for all&quot;, and see freezers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere, and think it's crazy.
</em><br>
<p>Actually this agument falls on its own sword -- *why* don't we see
<br>
cemeteries everywhere?  How are &quot;freezers&quot; and different from
<br>
&quot;grave plots&quot;?  And its obvious that freezers can be stacked
<br>
in 3 dimensions while people prefer to have &quot;grave plots&quot; in
<br>
2 dimensions.  One could make the argument that the turning
<br>
of cemetaries into freezeriums would free up land for agriculture,
<br>
solar power collection, apartment buildings, etc.
<br>
<p>With respect to writing -- I think a key point to stress might be
<br>
that the medical definition of &quot;death&quot; has evolved over the decades
<br>
or centuries (e.g. heart death, brain death, disassembly death).
<br>
Should the courts condemn individuals to one type of death when
<br>
they may not meet the criteria of another type?
<br>
<p>In addition can the courts assert that the individuals are *really*
<br>
dead?  We revive people with hearts that do not beat every day.
<br>
There was a recent case in the U.S. of an individual recovering
<br>
from a coma (a form of brain death) after something like 30 years.
<br>
Given something as simple as stem cell research -- how can a court
<br>
assert that the people are indeed dead? (assuming then that it has
<br>
jurisdiction over dead people).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The single most important step, in my opinion, would be for a French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer who &quot;gets it&quot; to contact Rémy's Lawyer, Alain Fouquet from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Angers (ask for contact info). If you know a non-French lawyer who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;gets it&quot;, maybe HE knows a French lawyer who gets it. (Maybe Greg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Burch?) FInd out.
</em><br>
<p>I would suspect that there may be a greater probability that someone
<br>
in the World Transhumanist Association, which has a particularly
<br>
strong foundation in Toronto might have connections in Montreal
<br>
which in turn might be leveraged into discussions with people
<br>
in France.
<br>
<p>Suggestions coming out of Canada might be much better received
<br>
in Europe than suggestions coming out of the U.S.
