<em>&gt; &gt; Is it clear that making the effort to exist, or to make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are 10 copies of yourself rather than 1 actually impacts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any way on the space of possibilities in any meaningful way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say yes, and the reason once again is the &quot;fraction&quot;.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of fraction is spiffed up in a branch of mathematics called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure theory, wherein one speaks of something's &quot;measure&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and one should read that as &quot;fraction&quot; or &quot;percentage&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Almost* everything is the same as it would be without MWI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or all the infinitely many other solar systems---but *not* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One difference is that if you had integrated these latest findings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into your emotional responses, then when a friend says that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brother has died after a terrible bout with cancer, you are properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathetic.  But if his brother died from having been struck by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a meteorite, you merely console your friend by reinforcing his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge that this was a fluke, and that his brother is doing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well in almost all the other solar systems and universes.
</em><br>
<p>Really? Is this a standard version of the MWI? (I am not really familiar
<br>
with Many World's and regard it with a degree of scepticism that 
<br>
virges on outright suspicion). But are you saying that in alternative
<br>
universes under MW's a meteorite strike can happen or not but that
<br>
cancer is a given in all of them? This seems pretty bizarre.
<br>
<p>It is far from clear to me that the &quot;randomness&quot; or &quot;determinism&quot; is 
<br>
essentially of a different class when one is considering a person 
<br>
being hit by a meteorite or not, on the one hand, and a person 
<br>
having the misfortune to have mutations occur in the the particular
<br>
part of a genome that will give rise to a malignant tumor or not
<br>
on the other hand. 
<br>
<p>Are you using &quot;standard&quot; Many Worlds Interpretation here?
