</em><br>
<p>Oh, this raises a host of issues -- starting with how one defines &quot;objective&quot;.
<br>
I can objectively assert that greatest complexity is good (extropic objectives)
<br>
or I can objectively assert that some great artistic expression is good
<br>
(to hell with the fact that there may be nobody to listen to or observe it).
<br>
<p>But in answer -- I *am* just &quot;thinking&quot; that my views are good and that
<br>
in part raised the Western/Eartern thought differences questions
<br>
(and how one might resolve them)...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is really what all the philosophical debating is all about. It
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  So I will conceed the points on needing to find a better
<br>
approach than simple utilitarian perspectives to tackle these
<br>
problems.  I will reserve the right however to point out when
<br>
the use of such methodologies may be unextropic.
<br>
<p>On a side note, probably the main reason I responded to this
<br>
post and a comment on why some might be feeling the ExI list
<br>
has become stale or non-progressive.
<br>
<p>Over time, it would appear to me that people get to know the
<br>
list participants sufficiently that a self-imposed behavioral
<br>
framework develops...
<br>
<p>a) Never open a debate with Eliezer on topics related to AI;
<br>
b) Never open a debate with Anders on Ethics (and perhaps a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;host of other topics);
<br>
c) Never open a debate with Robin on Economics or Physics;
<br>
d) Never open a debate with Mike on freedom or liberty;
<br>
e) Never open a debate with Spike on rocket science,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motorcycles or prime numbers,
<br>
f) Never open a philisophical debate with a whole host of people;
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Such debates might be of interest (educational value) to the
<br>
average list member but the probability that your horse is
<br>
going to get tripped up before it even gets out of the gate
<br>
is so high (for the individual proposing the debate) that
<br>
makes it a relatively worthless effort to even bring it
<br>
to the track.
<br>
<p>The result of this trend would appear to be to doom the list
<br>
to being nothing more than a news distribution list (e.g. not
<br>
too different from the transhumantech mailing list or Nanogirl
<br>
news) or a situation in which the only topics &quot;discussed&quot;
<br>
are those in which the people involved &quot;think&quot; that they
<br>
are right (and there aren't simple (logical) means to assert otherwise).
<br>
This ultimately tends to lead to flame wars.
<br>
<p>I think this characteristic might explain some of the perspectives
<br>
that have been expressed on the list recently.  Moreover it may
<br>
be a characteristic of mailing lists in general --  the WTA mailing
<br>
list(s) may not have the &quot;flavor&quot; of the ExI mailing list(s) at this
<br>
time but they might likely develop such a character if the list
<br>
membership remains stable over a long period of time.
