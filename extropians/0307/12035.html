<em>&gt; I believe Barbara that you may be getting at the question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What is the price of a moral code?&quot; -- it is somewhat different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from but related to &quot;What is the price of a legal code?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. If you wish to express it in these terms, then the question I
<br>
was getting at is: &quot;What is the price of the ABSENCE of a moral code?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Side note -- and &quot;accepting&quot; the legal code in Europe (presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a civilized society) may end up killing two people (the Martinots)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so the question gets raised as to when and when not a &quot;code&quot; *should*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be accepted.]
</em><br>
<p>Although there is usually quite a bit of overlap, a legal code and a moral
<br>
code are not identical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, not &quot;The hell with&quot; (since that would lead to chaos and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would likely be unextropic).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My perspective might be best viewed with Spock's observation --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I would suspect that it is not too different from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective that may have driven socialist or communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies during the last century.)
</em><br>
<p>This seems to be a different argument from the one you were making earlier.
<br>
Rather than saying that it's okay to disregard one's moral code, you now
<br>
seem to be arguing that a practical moral code should be in part based on
<br>
the assumption that the needs of many outweigh the needs of the few, or the
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>Having seen results of running businesses and nations using this assumption,
<br>
I cannot agree. The main problem with it is that the &quot;needs of the many,&quot;
<br>
and which persons qualify as members of {the many} are not always obvious.
<br>
In fact, the composition of{the many} seems to be almost completely
<br>
subjective, depending on who is making the call.  Apparently in your
<br>
scenario, the decision maker is whoever has the most potent weapons.
<br>
<p>But while I do not agree with the moral code you are suggesting, I would
<br>
certainly feel more comfortable dealing with you if I thought you adhered to
<br>
SOME moral code rather than just acted on whatever course of action seemed
<br>
to you at the moment to be expedient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If humanity dies any &quot;moral&quot; code (or legal code) dies with it.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, but the main purpose of moral and legal codes are to allow
<br>
people to live together successfully. Your suggestion of mass murder to save
<br>
humanity is qualitatively similar to spiking your drinking water with
<br>
arsenic to kill bacteria.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was quite interesting this week to watch the PBS viewing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the documentary on &quot;The Donner Party&quot;.  It documents quite well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how &quot;low&quot; humans may need to go to save themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (For those of you who have not seen this, I strongly recommend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as a view of a very unpleasant slice of &quot;reality&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the fate of the Donner Party is a fascinating tale, but if you're using
<br>
it to somehow justify your position, I think you need to explain further.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point (for Barbara) would be that in at least some situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans seem willing to discard the &quot;moral code&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Sure, as a lawyer I have the opportunity to observe such situations and such
<br>
people on a daily basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The question from an evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standpoint might be do we want to accept or be repulsed by situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which the moral code gets discarded?
</em><br>
<p>Well, above you said:  &lt;&lt;No, not &quot;The hell with&quot; (since that would lead to
<br>
chaos and that would likely be unextropic)&gt;&gt;
<br>
I believe that discarding the moral code and &quot;the hell with&quot; the moral code
<br>
both mean the same thing. Is your answer to this question therefore that you
<br>
would be repulsed by situations in which the moral code gets discarded?
<br>
<p>Barbara
