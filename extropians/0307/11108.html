I usually don't get involved in political discussions, but here's a good one.
<br>
<p>Mac
<br>
<p>Subj: And therein lies the truth
<br>
<p>How it all began -- conservatives and liberals
<br>
<p>&quot;The division of the human family into its two distinct branches, liberals 
<br>
and conservatives, occurred some 20,000 years ago.  Until then all humans 
<br>
coexisted as members of small bands of nomadic hunter/gatherers.   A 
<br>
thousand generations ago, in the pivotal event of societal evolution, beer 
<br>
was invented.  This epochal innovation was both the foundation of modern 
<br>
civilization and the occasion of the great bifurcation of humanity into its 
<br>
two distinct subgroups.   Once beer was discovered, our prehistoric 
<br>
forebears decided it was time to settle down.  Making beer required grain, 
<br>
and securing a steady supply of it ordained the invention of 
<br>
agriculture.   After that was accomplished, ancient man quickly, and 
<br>
unfairly, consigned actual cultivation to women.   Men couldn't just run 
<br>
off, willy-nilly, however.  Neither the glass bottle nor the aluminum can 
<br>
had yet been invented, so it was necessary to stick pretty close to home, 
<br>
and the brewery.
<br>
<p>This left our male ancestors with a lot of time on their hands, and led to 
<br>
the division of the species, which persists to this day.   Some men tried 
<br>
to conserve remnants of the old way of life (hence the term &quot;conservative&quot;) 
<br>
by spending their days in the open field in the dangerous pursuit of big 
<br>
game animals.  At night they would roast their prey at a big barbecue, and 
<br>
afterwards sat around the fire drinking beer, passing wind and telling off 
<br>
color jokes.   Other, more timid, souls stayed closer to home.  They are 
<br>
responsible for the domestication of cats and the invention of group 
<br>
therapy.  Mostly, they sat around worrying about how life wasn't fair and 
<br>
concocting elaborate schemes to &quot;liberate&quot; themselves from inequity (thus 
<br>
their designation as &quot;liberals&quot;).  In the evening they gathered around 
<br>
their fire, nibbling on fruit and nuts, sharing their innermost feelings.
<br>
<p>Today some liberals try to pretend they're really sort of conservative, and 
<br>
sometimes succeed in confusing people.  The following are a few tips to use 
<br>
in distinguishing the two types.   By definition liberals believe in big 
<br>
government and high taxes.  Life is unfair and the government is there to 
<br>
do something about it.  Most people are too stupid to spend untaxed income 
<br>
wisely, they say, and high taxes allow liberals in government to do a 
<br>
better job of it.
<br>
<p>Conservatives don't like government, and, aside from the military, wish it 
<br>
would just go away.  They hate taxes, regulations, speed limits, and small 
<br>
cars.   Typical conservatives are Arnold Schwarzenegger, Ronald Reagan, 
<br>
Rush Limbaugh and, up there with the Big Man in the Sky, the incomparable 
<br>
John Wayne.
<br>
<p>Typical liberals are Dustin Hoffman, Shirley McLaine,  Pee Wee Herman, 
<br>
Martin Sheen, Sean Penn, Barbara Streisand, Ted Turner and his former wife, 
<br>
the traitor Jane Fonda.
<br>
<p>All conservatives drink beer.  American beer.   Some liberals like imported 
<br>
beer, but most prefer white wine or foreign water from a bottle.   Liberals 
<br>
like to drive Volvos and Saabs because they're made in socialist 
<br>
Sweden.  They like to eat weird food because it's un-American.
<br>
<p>Your basic conservative vehicle, especially in Alaska, is the Chevy 
<br>
Suburban.  It's big, it's American, it's four wheel drive, and it sucks up 
<br>
the gas.  Conservatives eat beef, which they (surprise!) like to 
<br>
barbecue.   Big game hunters are conservative.  Interior decorators are 
<br>
liberal.   Liberals invented the designated hitter rule in baseball because 
<br>
it wasn't &quot;fair&quot; to make the poor pitcher take his turn at bat. 
<br>
Conservatives, inspired by a remark of the legendary Pittsburgh Steeler 
<br>
linebacker Jack Lambert, believe quarterbacks should be required to wear 
<br>
skirts, so they can more easily be distinguished from real football players.
<br>
<p>James Brown and Ray Charles are conservatives. Michael Jackson and Milli 
<br>
Vanilli are liberals.   Most social workers, personal injury lawyers, 
<br>
journalists, and group therapists are liberals.  Most ranchers, loggers, 
<br>
professional soldiers, and steeplejacks are conservatives.   Liberal jurors 
<br>
distrust the prosecutors and police.  Conservatives figure the defendant 
<br>
must be guilty or he wouldn't be on trial.   Most conservatives not only 
<br>
believe in the death penalty, they would cheerfully implement it, 
<br>
personally, if called upon to do so. Liberals think capital punishment is a 
<br>
barbaric relic, and unfair to boot.   Liberals believe Europeans are, 
<br>
generally speaking, far more enlightened than Americans.  Conservatives 
<br>
think they're basically decadent, as evidenced by their complete absence in 
<br>
wars.   Typical conservative movies are &quot;Raising Arizona&quot;, &quot;Patton&quot;, and 
<br>
&quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Typical liberal movies are &quot;Prince of Tides&quot;, &quot;Last 
<br>
Tango in Paris&quot;, and &quot;The Big Chill&quot;.   The quintessential liberal is the 
<br>
handicapper, the person who decides how much extra weight to saddle the 
<br>
faster horses with in order to make the race &quot;fair&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The American cowboy, of course, is your basic, full bore conservative. A 
<br>
hundred years ago an Englishman in South Dakota was trying to find the 
<br>
owner of a huge cattle ranch.  He rode up to one of the ranch hands and 
<br>
asked, &quot;Excuse me, but could you tell me where to find your Master?&quot;  To 
<br>
which the cowboy replied, &quot;That sumbitch hasn't been born yet.&quot;
