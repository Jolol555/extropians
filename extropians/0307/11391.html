They're basically saying the effects of gravity can't be felt until the
<br>
light from the event hits you.
<br>
Its like a sonic boom; since light is travelling faster than sound, you
<br>
see the light first, before the
<br>
pressure waves hit you.  So if you lived in a universe where the speed
<br>
of gravity (its propogation),
<br>
was as slow as the speed of sound,  then you might see the event, before
<br>
you feel the effects of
<br>
the gravitational change...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Think of it this way, ur one light year away from a spontaneous black
<br>
hole forming (hypothetically
<br>
just say it popped into existence one light year away); you would see
<br>
(just assume for the example
<br>
that light could escape it at that distance) the black hole suck
<br>
everything in, before you would feel
<br>
your body suddenly get pulled into it :)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Interesting example though :) Kudos to the poster :)  It also suggests a
<br>
way of confirming it; the
<br>
propogation speed of gravity that is....

<p><p><p><p>Can you clarify what you imagine this world would be like. To me I can't

really see that the propogation speed would make any observable

difference as the effective force levels would still be the same in any

region. Due to the fact that gravity doesn't switch on and off and has
<br>
already propogated to any region where its effect might be felt.
<br>
Also due to the fact that the force of gravity is due to the mass of the
<br>
body exerting the force, not the propogation speed.
<br>
Does that make any sense at all, or should I go get a cool beer and
<br>
start chemically pruning my slower brain cells ?
