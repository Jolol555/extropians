<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;        What is the probability that a child will be born with

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;        deformities if its mother had rubella during her pregnancy?
</em><br>
<p>The last question, if read literally, allows for the possibility of 
<br>
deformities not caused by rubella.  Similarly the second statement would 
<br>
have been better written &quot;If a child is born without deformities traceable 
<br>
to a sickness of its mother&quot;.  Personally I found it quite evident what 
<br>
was meant; but yes, it is not a perfect phrasing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, all right.  It just looks as though they are saying p(HD) != P(H)*p(D|H):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       The most frequent non-Bayesian algorithms they identified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       include computing p (H&amp;D) by multiplying p (H) and p (D | H);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they are giving points to the test-takers only for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of Bayes formula---and, apparently, only to using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posterior/prior odds formulation of it no less---(and in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faulty problem to boot).
</em><br>
<p>I do not think the authors of this paper are investigating what you think 
<br>
they are investigating.  They are investigating failures of rationality 
<br>
that everyone, Bayesians and frequentists alike, agree upon.  They simply 
<br>
call them &quot;non-Bayesian&quot; which is a standard term for &quot;wrong answer&quot; *in 
<br>
the academic subfield of heuristics and biases*, regardless of its meaning 
<br>
in the academic subfield of statistics.
<br>
<p>Offhand I cannot recall a case of Gigerenzer getting mixed up in the 
<br>
dispute over Bayesian versus frequentist methods.  (Note use of 
<br>
availability heuristic...)  He works in the Tversky-and-Kahneman, 
<br>
heuristics-and-biases field, where it is uncontroversial to equate 
<br>
Bayesian reasoning with normative rationality and &quot;the Bayesian answer&quot; is 
<br>
simply a more technical way of saying &quot;the correct answer&quot; or &quot;the 
<br>
normative answer&quot;.
<br>
<p>They are giving points to the subjects only for the correct answer, 
<br>
however arrived at - they do not check the work done to see if Bayes' 
<br>
Theorem was explicitly used.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, I've examined his book on-line, but then they took it offline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the book was being printed.  Last time I checked, it was back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the book was supposed to be published this year (all 2000 pages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever of it), and that's what I want to get.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do need better examples of where the Bayesians and non-Bayesians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree.  (I have wanted to be in on that controversy since 1972,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and always felt side-lined.)  I hope that not all Jaynes' examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to do with prior distributions, unbiased estimators,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformations of likelihood, and so on.
</em><br>
<p>Not the book, &quot;Probability Theory, the Logic of Science&quot;.  The lectures, 
<br>
&quot;Probability Theory with Applications in Science and Engineering&quot;, which 
<br>
are online, and also more accessible.
