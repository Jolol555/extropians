Eliezer writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not the book, &quot;Probability Theory, the Logic of Science&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That's the new one.  It's unfinished and has all his great polemics
<br>
in it.  Jaynes was quite the guy.  I agreed very much with his 
<br>
attitudes on many issues only marginally relevant to probability
<br>
and decision theory---but basically, he agreed with Kolmogorov
<br>
and disagreed with DeFinitti in the end.
<br>
<p>I have to get that book.  I could have sworn it was on-line too,
<br>
or at least a lot of the chapters.  But maybe I was thinking of
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The lectures, &quot;Probability Theory with Applications in Science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Engineering&quot;, which are online, and also more accessible.

</em><br>
<p>Amazon has the big book, I'll get it, but meanwhile thanks for the
<br>
link to this.
<br>
<p>On Amazon, by the way, the reviews are quite interesting.  Here is
<br>
an excerpt from one
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewer: Michael Hardy
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To &quot;pure&quot; mathematicians, probability theory is measure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theory in spaces of measure 1.  To the extent to which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you remain a &quot;pure&quot; mathematician, this book [Prob The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic of Science] will be incomprehensible to you.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To frequentist statisticians, probability theory is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;study of relative frequencies or of proportions of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;population; those are &quot;probabilities&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Bayesian statisticians, probability theory is the study
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of degrees of belief.  Bayesians may assign probability 1/2
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the proposition that there was life on Mars a billion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years ago; frequentists will not do that because they cannot
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say that there was life on Mars a billion years ago in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precisely half of all cases -- there are no such &quot;cases&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To _subjective_ Bayesians, probability theory is about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subjective degrees of belief.  A subjective degree of belief
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is merely how sure you happen to be.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Noninformative&quot; _objective_ Bayesians assign &quot;noninformative&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probability distributions when they deal with uncertain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;propositions or uncertain quantities, and replace them with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;informative&quot; distributions only when they update them because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of &quot;data&quot;. &quot;Data&quot;, in this sense, consists of the outcomes of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;random experiments.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Informative&quot; _objective_ Bayesians -- a rare species -- ask
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what degree of belief in an uncertain proposition is logically
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessitated by whatever information one has, and they don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessarily require that information to consist of outcomes of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;random experiments.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaynes is an &quot;informative&quot; objective Bayesian.  This book is his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;defense of that position and his account of how it is to be used.
<br>
<p>Hooray!  &quot;Subjective&quot; used to drive me crazy (even though now, after
<br>
further progress understanding Many Worlds, it's beginning to make
<br>
sense after all!).  But I still hope that &quot;objective&quot; can be retained.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pure&quot; mathematicians will not find that this book resembles that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branch of &quot;pure&quot; mathematics that they call probability theory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Unfortunately Jaynes's misunderstandings may cause some others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to misunderstand him when he is right.  Statisticians are more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;informed than &quot;pure&quot; mathematicians and will disagree with Jaynes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for better reasons.  _Some_ statisticians will agree with him.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaynes has many flaws, made all the more annoying by the fact that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we need to overlook them in order to understand him.  His message
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is important. 
<br>
