<em>&gt; Right.  I agree completely.  I just resubscribed here after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some 18 months (IIRC).  The last time I was active here I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became rather disillusioned and over the last year or so I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can honestly say I haven't so much as thought about extropy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or transhumanism.  I came back for some nostalgia.
</em><br>
<p>Welcome back!  I was just complaining about losing list members.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think part of the problem is that we need to bracket a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain number of &quot;ultratechnologies,&quot; the singularities in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our equations, these being superintelligence, uploading, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drexlerian nanotechnology.[...]
</em><br>
<p>Good points.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extropy is a child of the computer age, so it's little wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that these three embody it so profoundly, and not only through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their crippling optimism.
</em><br>
<p>This makes sense to me.  We are having the same design problems that the
<br>
computer age has had.  Software design and communications improvements
<br>
are tremendous, but haven't resulted in the magnitudes of improvement
<br>
that we expected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moore's Law, a fundamental adage of our philosophy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and of computer science, despite being a marketing technique 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a particular company that decided to reduce component size 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and increase speeds, design be damned.
</em><br>
<p>I wish more people understood this.  Moore's law IS a marketing ploy.
<br>
Are there any real engineers that quote or use this &quot;law&quot;, or even
<br>
believe it qualifies as a &quot;law&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; another part of computer age mythos: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstractionism.  Of course, there's no physical theory for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading, except perhaps, if you might allow, this short, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly erroneous argument: (1) at the quantum level reality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is discrete; (2) therefore, a quantum computer can simulate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any part of reality; (3) the brain probably isn't capable of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploiting quantum mechanical effects; (4) therefore, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical computer can simulate a brain that is identical to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and identifiable with the original.
</em><br>
<p>Another interesting parallel to technology here.  Abstraction is a good
<br>
tool, but in practice it has lead too many people to design bloated,
<br>
inefficient, unreliable software.  Similarly, I think our ideas about
<br>
technology have been abstracted to the point that we produce bloated,
<br>
inefficient and unreliable expectations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This, at least, is what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can salvage from my side of those copy arguments we used to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.  (I concede.)  And finally, we shovel all the real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems under that carpet we call &quot;software.&quot;  This is part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that larger Myth of the Computer Age: universality.  We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do anything in software, given enough speed.  This is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true in any practical or useful sense, however.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed!  The myth I keep running into is the seven-layer model of
<br>
networking.  It says that layers are abstracted independently of each
<br>
other so that the physical, data-link, network, transport, session,
<br>
presentation, application layers can all mix-and-match/plug-and-play/and
<br>
be vendor neutral.  It sounds good in theory, but it isn't real.  If it
<br>
were real, we should be able to run a Linux program displaying IBM
<br>
EBCDIC characters over an http web session via a non-TCP protocol on an
<br>
appletalk network running Microsoft netbios on an ATM link!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I say the following with complete confidence: there will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no Yudkowskian Singularity, the copy is not the original, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation of the first assembler will not cause an immediate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolution in manufacturing.  These are science fiction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pipedreams.  
</em><br>
<p>I believe that these things will happen eventually.  But they will be
<br>
carved out with great difficulty at every step of the process.
<br>
Technology gets more complicated as it grows exponentially.  Layers upon
<br>
layers of abstraction make system unpredictable.  Complexities make
<br>
seeing the complete picture more and more impossible.  As technology
<br>
solves our problems, we are presented with more numerous and more
<br>
difficult problems.  Like a video game where you never win, we just keep
<br>
advancing to more and more difficult levels.  The work gets harder, the
<br>
rewards get bigger, the disasters get worse, and the process repeats
<br>
itself over and over.  There is no end to this process, and I'm not sure
<br>
why so many people on the Luddite side and on the technology side think
<br>
there is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, and as well as realising that this stuff requires hard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work, we need a *critical* approach to technology.  We need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take our heads out of the sand, lose the ridiculous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;luddite&quot; talk, and realise that, yes, technology does effect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples lives, and that, no, not all technology effects all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives in a positive way.  Technophilia doesn't cut it.  
</em><br>
<p>Agreed!  I have come to believe that the Luddites are right in their
<br>
fears.  This stuff is dangerous and will cause problems.  However, I
<br>
don't believe they are right in their solutions.  We can't just ignore
<br>
the stuff or get everybody to agree to relinquish any use of technology.
<br>
We must strive to make sure that safety and security are included in all
<br>
technology.  We need to make sure that dangerous technology doesn't
<br>
accidentally destroy the world just as we have to make sure that
<br>
dangerous terrorists don't deliberately destroy the world.  This takes
<br>
auditing, accountability, transparency, negotiation and a whole lot of
<br>
attitude adjustment.  People who risk massive disasters without taking
<br>
proper precautions are like terrorists.  They risk other people's lives
<br>
to achieve their own goals.  They don't care if other people die if it
<br>
will help them reach their own goals.  There must be a way to work with
<br>
Luddites, identify real problems, and then develop solutions to address
<br>
these concerns.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Technology is ideological in the strongest sense.
</em><br>
<p>You make a lot of excellent points that I agree with.  Mike Lorrey is
<br>
also making other points that I agree with.  Anders said it best when he
<br>
said we are in a phase of &quot;growing up&quot;.  Our college-days of idealism
<br>
are gone.  We are in the real world now.  Things aren't as rosy as we
<br>
thought.  We live in a Dilbertesque world, and there are too many
<br>
pointy-haired bosses calling the shots who don't understand what they
<br>
are talking about.  We want to make a difference, and still want to
<br>
pursue our dreams.  But we have to adapt to the real world and the real
<br>
future.  The future isn't turning out to be what we expected it to be.
