<p>Cutting-Edge Science Creates Stain-Free Pants. Scientists are wrestling with
<br>
individual atoms to develop molecule-sized computers, tiny cancer-fighting
<br>
robots that travel the bloodstream ... and stain-resistant trousers.
<br>
Nanotechnology -- the science of manipulating materials billionths of a
<br>
meter (meter) wide -- has emerged as a promising new field that could lead
<br>
to stunning advances in years to come. Boosters claim that nanotech-derived
<br>
products may some day cure disease, slow the aging process and eliminate
<br>
pollution. But for now, the human race will have to settle for tennis balls
<br>
that keep their bounce longer, flat-panel displays that shine brighter and
<br>
wrinkle-free khaki slacks that resist coffee stains. &quot;People are saying,
<br>
'Geez, this isn't Star Trek yet; this is just pants that don't stain,' but
<br>
you've got to start somewhere,&quot; said Howard Lovy, news editor of the
<br>
nanotech industry journal Small Times. &quot;I'm wearing nano-pants as we speak.&quot;

<p>Manufacturing technique offers possibilities for electronics industry.
<br>
Manufacturing the minute may have gotten cheaper and more exact, thanks to a
<br>
new technique developed by an international team of researchers. The
<br>
technique, described in the July 24 issue of the journal Nature, marries two
<br>
approaches to lower the cost and improve the control of producing materials
<br>
at the molecular level. This hybrid approach, say the researchers, could
<br>
lead to computers, personal data assistants and cell phones that offer the
<br>
densest data capacity stored in the tiniest packages. (University of
<br>

<p>Physicists Build World's Smallest Motor Using Nanotubes And Etched Silicon.
<br>
Only 15 years after University of California, Berkeley, engineers built the
<br>
first micro-scale motor, a UC Berkeley physicist has created the first
<br>
nano-scale motor - a gold rotor on a nanotube shaft that could ride on the
<br>
back of a virus. &quot;It's the smallest synthetic motor that's ever been made,&quot;
<br>
said Alex Zettl, professor of physics at UC Berkeley and faculty scientist
<br>
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. &quot;Nature is still a little bit
<br>
ahead of us - there are biological motors that are equal or slightly smaller
<br>
in size - but we are catching up.&quot;

<p>Greenpeace issues major report on nanotechnology. It was reported today
<br>
[Greenpeace Wades Into Nano Debate With Report That Calls For Caution, by
<br>
Douglas Brown, Small Times Correspondent] that Greenpeace issued a 72-page
<br>
report, published in the magazine New Scientist, calling on government and
<br>
industry to do much more to stay on top of the environmental, medical and
<br>
ethical challenges posed by nanotechnology. The report does not appear to be
<br>
available on the New Scientist web site as of this writing, but it has
<br>
already drawn comments as described in the Small Times article and in the
<br>
following submissions from two Nanodot readers. (Nanodot 7/24/03)

conditional support of the Greenpeace report, &quot;Future technologies, today's

&quot;We've heard from extremists on both sides,&quot; said Mike Treder, Executive

Director of CRN. &quot;Now it's time for sober discussion and serious research.

<p>Titania nanotubes make supersensitive hydrogen sensors. Titania nanotubes
<br>
are 1,500 times better than the next best material for sensing hydrogen and
<br>
may be one of the first examples of materials properties changing
<br>
dramatically when crossing the border between real world sizes and
<br>
nanoscopic dimensions, according to a Penn State materials scientist.
<br>
''Historically, we have viewed sensor technology and enhancements from the
<br>
point of view of surface area,'' says Craig A. Grimes, associate professor
<br>
of electrical engineering and materials science and engineering. ''The
<br>
principle in play in titania nanotubes is not surface area, but connectivity
<br>
of the tiny tubes and we see an incredible change in electric resistance.''

<p>(life extension) Fancy living another 100 years, or more? Some experts said

on Saturday that scientific advances will one day enable humans to last

decades beyond what is now seen as the natural limit of the human life span.

<p>Howard Lovy's NanoBot. Nanotechnology information and commentary from the
<br>
news editor at Small Times Media. Don't hate me because I'm nano-beautiful.
<br>
This recent New York Post story had me thinking about beauty. Small Times
<br>
reported last year that nanomaterials had been used in cosmetics for years
<br>
(L'Oreal has had them in products since 1995, despite the Post's assertion
<br>
that, &quot;Even big names like L'Oreal are getting into the act.&quot;). So now, with
<br>
renewed debate surrounding what is not known about nanoparticles, the fact
<br>
that nanoscale zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are used in some brands of
<br>
cosmetics and sunscreen are continuously juxtaposed with news reports about
<br>
the controversy.

<p>Rice's chemical 'scissors' yield short carbon nanotubes. Chemists at Rice
<br>
University have identified a chemical process for cutting carbon nanotubes
<br>
that yields short tube segments that are suited to a variety of
<br>
applications, including biomedical sensors small enough to migrate through
<br>
cells without triggering immune reactions. The 'chemical scissors' process
<br>
involves fluorinating nanotubes and then heating them to about 1,000 Celsius
<br>
in an argon atmosphere. The heating drives off the fluorine and cuts the
<br>
nanotubes into segments ranging from 20-300 nanometers. (EurekAlert 7/22/03)

<p>Science of the small poses big dilemma. Campaigners on both sides of the
<br>
nanotechology divide are calling for more dialogue about the benefits and
<br>
risks of a field that is beginning to revolutionize science. Nanotechnology
<br>
is the manipulation of particles at the nanoscale - one-millionth of a
<br>
millimetre. Supporters in Switzerland say the discipline has the potential
<br>
to create huge benefits in areas such as medicine, electronics, chemistry
<br>
and computing. Critics say we need to understand whether it raises new

ethical, health and safety or social issues before we go any further. (NZZ

<p>Nanotech moves the future to a new level. Fear of the science of the small
<br>
'is focused on the wrong things'. Nanotechnology, which is predicted to grow
<br>
into a $1 trillion industry within a decade, could like GM food technology
<br>
become a political battleground, an economic and social research council
<br>
report published today says. Nanotechnology is the science of manipulating
<br>
material at the atomic scale, to make tools measured in billionths of a
<br>
metre. The report, by three Sheffield University academics, says the debate
<br>
on its implication has become polarised between visions of utopia and
<br>
planetary catastrophe. (EducationGuardian 7/28/03)

<p>Nano threats and challenges. Worries in the science community about a public
<br>
backlash against nanotechnology have been growing in recent months.
<br>
Currently, public fears range from the reasonable, such as the unknown
<br>
effects of nanoparticles on health and the environment, to what scientists
<br>
consider to be the ridiculous - a world overrun by plagues of
<br>
self-replicating nanorobots. This is the &quot;grey goo&quot; scenario that looms
<br>
large in Prey, the recent novel by Michael Crichton that seems to have
<br>
kick-started this current bout of nano-angst. The nightmare scenario for
<br>
scientists is that the public - egged on by various pressure groups - will
<br>
reject nanotechnology in the same way that the UK and other countries have
<br>
rejected genetically modified (GM) food. (PhysicsWeb July, 2003)
