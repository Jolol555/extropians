&quot;The only obstacles to accurate prophecy are the vested
interests, which may retard progress for economic reasons,
tradition, conservatism, labor-union policies and legislation.
If we confine ourselves to processes and inventions that are
now being hatched in the laboratory, we shall not wander too
far from reality&quot;
---
The extent to which politics and current social structures
and vested interests can mitigate or retard the emergence
of technological solutions that look eminently desirable and
reasonable to extropic types seems to be a key differentiator
amongst us.
Some seem more of the view that nothing can stop a
technological breakthrough who's time has come others
are considerably less sure.
Penicillin sat on the to be further investigated eventually
shelf for something like 20 years before WW11 and the
Normanby invasion with the anticipation of massive casualties
sparked up the research and development engines.
The space race seems to have been driven largely as a sideline
to the cold war.
Ironic that plain old fashion military considerations (not greatly
different from what probably drove innovations 50,000 years
ago) seem to drive the innovation streak in us so strongly.
Jet engines, rocketry, nuclear fission.
Pity we can't re-categorise the common enemy and the &quot;principle
war&quot; as being against death. Or can we and perhaps are we?
