Subject: toilet head dunking
<br>
<p><p>At 07:46 PM 7/7/03 -0700, Spike wrote of what:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;happened to you when you were in elementary school
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and were seen walking your bike across the street:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they caught you by the ankles and dunked your head
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the toilet.
</em><br>
<p>...That can't happen in Australia...If an Aussie dweeb were head-dunked,
<br>
all he'd get would be a wet scalp. Better design all round, I'd
<br>
say...Damien Broderick
<br>
<p><p><p><p>I asked my neighbor who has children, and learned
<br>
that things are a bit different today than the 60s,
<br>
when we were children.  Kids today are not allowed
<br>
to thrash, threaten and abuse each other the way they 
<br>
did back then.  The schools now are much more conscious
<br>
of legal liability should little Johnny come home
<br>
with a bloody nose or broken tooth.
<br>
<p>In my own misspent youth, the students were allowed
<br>
(yea encouraged) to beat each other early and often.
<br>
For this would result in their becoming practiced 
<br>
and confident fighters.
<br>
<p>The notion in those years of peace, love and
<br>
understanding was that this old world would be more
<br>
or less at war constantly until the nuclear holocaust
<br>
ended our strife forever.  Until that time of course
<br>
there would be a persistent need for soldiers, whose
<br>
fighting skills were honed from an early age whether
<br>
they liked it or not.  Fortunately the future aint 
<br>
what it used to be.
<br>
<p>It could be that most kids now go thru their entire
<br>
school years without ever having their heads
<br>
dunked into the toilet, and perhaps without even
<br>
a hazing or beating.  Their resulting inability to
<br>
fight is perhaps what is pushing ever more advanced
<br>
mechanization of warfare.  A mutual inability to fight
<br>
will perhaps complete the metamorphosis of warfare
<br>
to the point where any war consists entirely 
<br>
information being exchanged instead of lead.
