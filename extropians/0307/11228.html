<p>FAQ for cheerers:
<br>
<p>Q: Ra, ra, ra!  This stuff is really keen!  How do I
<br>
get ahold of it?
<br>
<p>A: X is being sold by Y.  Z, you'll have to make
<br>
yourself.
<br>
<p>Q: Make it myself?  But that's...hard, as in math!
<br>
<p>A: Yeah, but consider all the benefits you can get
<br>
from doing it.  (List includes starting businesses,
<br>
getting rich, and BTW making sure the originally
<br>
sought after thing - anti-aging medicine or uploading,
<br>
say, which one's own life could someday depend on - is
<br>
available at all.)
<br>
<p>Q: Okay, you convinced me to play, but I don't know
<br>
how.
<br>
<p>A: Here are some links to get you started.  If you're
<br>
still in (or not yet in) college, here's some majors
<br>
you might want to look at.  If you're out in the
<br>
working world, here are some companies to talk to for
<br>
each X, and here are some funding sources known to be
<br>
friendly to transhuman ventures (and here is how to
<br>
talk to them in their own language: make very certain
<br>
to read this, lest you give the false appearance of
<br>
someone who doesn't know what they're talking about
<br>
and get nowhere fast).
<br>
<p>It might help if someone with more patience and
<br>
diplomacy than I presently possess regarding this
<br>
topic were to write the above up into a serious
<br>
document.
