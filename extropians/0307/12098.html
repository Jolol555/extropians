<p>
I think this hypothesis has some general truth to it. I have spent a
<br>
lot of time in Asia, taught Asians, and have an Asian wife (from
<br>
Taiwan).  
<br>
<p>Maybe some of this difference in thinking styles has something to do
<br>
with the educational systems there.
<br>
<p>They do have great respect for education.  They also yearn for
<br>
education.
<br>
<p>For example, they do have soap operas in Taiwan.  One common plot line
<br>
involves a young man who is from common working stock, and who wants
<br>
to be educated.  But many schools there are quite competitve, and not
<br>
everyone can be educated, and the dreams of many are smashed by scores
<br>
on tests, which they cannot pass. Often these are standardized tests.
<br>
So they are flunked out.  THe young man continues to strive, to work
<br>
towards his dream--his dream of passing the test, and being educated.
<br>
So this is the whole soap opera--the story of the young man's struggle
<br>
with a test and with the educational system.  Very popular plot line
<br>
in Taiwanese soap operas.
<br>
<p>Compare that with our own soap opera plotlines....
<br>
<p>But even so, Asian education in large part seems to revolve around
<br>
success in the system and not with learning. THere seems to be much
<br>
less interest in learning for learning's sake.
<br>
<p>Also, my wife, who has a degree from Tawan, and is working on a degree
<br>
here, often complains about the teaching here as compared to Taiwan:
<br>
apparently the professors here do not teach to the test nearly as well
<br>
as in Taiwan,  THere, the prof goes over everything needed to pass the
<br>
test in the classroom.  THere is little doubt or ambiguity about
<br>
anything.  Not much aggressive or independent learning or research
<br>
goes on there.  Also, lab work (in engineering), is apparently far
<br>
more difficult here).
<br>
<p>As for the Mandarin language, one interesting aspect about it that I
<br>
can gather is that the characters also tell a historical story.  This
<br>
is supposedly why Taiwanese do not like the simplified characters used
<br>
by China: the simplified characters lose their historical
<br>
significance.
