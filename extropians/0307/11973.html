<em>&gt; &gt; The question is, how accurate is his worry that by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &quot;playing along&quot; with the system for two more years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he will compromise his own resistance?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely this is a judgment call based on the strength of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conviction of the individual and just how large the gap
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is between his beliefs and the beliefs he would pretend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think a good place to search for past examples of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in espionage.  What little I know of the field leads me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe that a great many spies have been in &quot;deep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover&quot; for years at a time without  switching allegiances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or at least, that's how it is in the spy movies and books.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  :)
</em><br>
<p>Good point. There was a recent mini-series here in OZ
<br>
based on the Cambridge spies, Burgess, Philby, McLean (?)
<br>
and I forget the last. Point is though that this was not
<br>
*just* fiction. These guys were in deep cover and managed
<br>
to get to the highest levels of influence. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps significantly though there were four of them 
<br>
in allegiance, they did not have to keep a secret alone.
<br>
At least periodically they could get together and share
<br>
some angst and reassure each other that all was for the
<br>
greater good (as they saw it). And also significantly
<br>
when one of then fell the others were well aware that
<br>
all of them would almost certainly fall quickly afterwards.
