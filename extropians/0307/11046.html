The Tomorrow People
<br>
(keyed in from a poor fax of the March 26, [1995] UK Observer cover story.
<br>
Inferred text is in brackets. - RM)
<br>
<p>Max More and the Extropians say it is time to stop fretting about the
<br>
future. Forget eco-panic, limits to growth, even death. Extropians want to
<br>
be immortal and travel through space and time. They are also libertarians
<br>
who want to privatise the oceans and the air.
<br>
<p>- Jim McClellan on a boundlessly optimistic Californian cult -
<br>
<p>Just another LA Sunday at the end of the millenium. Outside, it's pouring
<br>
down. It's been like this for the past two days. Upstate, things are
<br>
getting bad: floods, mud slides, deaths, million of dollar's worth of
<br>
property damage. I'm sitting in a comfy suburban apartment talking to a
<br>
charming young man called Jay Prime Positive about the sort of body he
<br>
wants to inhabit after he &quot;uploads&quot; his consciousness to a computer. &quot;I'd
<br>
probably want to spend most of my time in dataspace, but I do want to
<br>
interact with the real stuff some of the time,&quot; says Jay. &quot;But really, I
<br>
imagine having multiple bodies and multiple copies of myself. I have
<br>
problems with gender identification, so I'd definitely have a female body
<br>
in there somewhere.&quot; As I said, just another LA Sunday at the end of the
<br>
millenium.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not feel in great physical shape, but you've perhaps never
<br>
thought of ditching your body altogether and uploading your consciousness
<br>
to a computer. Or making multiple copies of yourself so that when the
<br>
inevitable Big Systems Crash happens, you can re-boot another and you can
<br>
start again. You perhaps never pondered the benefits of setting loose
<br>
molecule-sized robots in your body to clean your arteries. Or thought about
<br>
how the principles of quantum mechanics could be used to knock up a
<br>
parallel universe in your garden shed. Or sat down and planned the creation
<br>
of a whole new country, a floating free state banged together out of old
<br>
oil tankers, a place where freedom and unbounded intellect could reign and
<br>
you could finally get the damn government - and the taxman - off your back.
<br>
You may perhaps have dreamed of living forever, but have you signed up to
<br>
put your brain on ice when you die?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extropians like Jay and the other people crammed into the Culver
<br>
City apartment have given these matters a lot of thought. A loose
<br>
association, a science faction, if you like, of computer programmers,
<br>
philosophy graduates, [rese]archers, scientists, and libertarians, they're
<br>
devoted to [figh]ting entropy and all that doomy stuff about finite
<br>
[reso]urces and the inevitable heat death of the universe. [Inst]ead
<br>
they're dedicated to promoting the forces of [extr]opy (the opposite of
<br>
entropy). They celebrate possi[bilities,]
<br>
freedom and boundless growth, the appliance of sci[ence] and sexy,
<br>
high-powered technology. They want [to go] beyond the limits of nature and
<br>
biology and move on [to] the stars. Though mainly made up of Americans, the
<br>
[prim]e mover behind the Extropian Institute, one Max [Mor]e, is a
<br>
pony-tailed 30-year-old born and brought up in [Bris]tol, England.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[M]ax and his fellow Extropians feel it is time to stop feel[ing]
<br>
bad about the future. Forget eco panic, limits to growth, death even. The
<br>
hole in the ozone layer? Don't [wor]ry. We'll fix it. A New Age of Reason
<br>
is about to dawn in [whi]ch the sky's the limit. Space travel, immortality,
<br>
huge [pector]al muscles, and and end to the evils of big government [and]
<br>
cellulite. &quot;No mysteries are sacrosanct, no limits [unq]uestionable. The
<br>
unknown will yield to the ingenious [min]d,&quot; says Max.
<br>
<p>[E]xtropianism may seem to have its face set firmly to [the] future but
<br>
actually its roots are in ideas and fads from [the p]ast three decades. It
<br>
mixes the &quot;every day in every way [I'm] getting better and better&quot; pop
<br>
therapies of the 1970's,[s]elf-help neo-conservative economic individualism
<br>
and [work]-out culture of the 1980's, and the neo-biological opti[mis]m of
<br>
the digital 1990's with a belief that computers have [jump]-started a new
<br>
stage in human evolution.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[A]lso in the theoretical mix are the libertarian ideas and [econ]om
<br>
ics of Ayn Rand and Friedrich Hayek, complexity [and] chaos theory,
<br>
Nietszche, comic books and science [ficti]on, digitial technology,
<br>
cryonics, nanotechnology, and [vari]ed weird sciences.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ex]tropianism isn't just a philosophical programme, [how]ever. It
<br>
is also a kind of lifestyle futurism. There are [Extr]opian T-shirts,
<br>
greetings (&quot;Upward and Outward!&quot;) and [han]dshakes (a cross between a high
<br>
five and something [out] of Star Trek in which you sort of link hands and
<br>
reach on [up t]ogether). There's a whole mini-dictionary of new [Extr]opian
<br>
words (smart-faced,
<br>
cryocrastination, extropia). [The]re are Extropian names. An upbeat new
<br>
name, after all, [is th]e the first step towards self-transformation. Max
<br>
More was [born] Max O'Connor. Other notable Extropians include [Mar]k Plus
<br>
and Simon! D Levy - a name, you suspect, which [nee]ds a little more
<br>
boundless optimism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ex]tropianism seems more American than America itself, [al]most a
<br>
parody of the American Dream - so it shouldn't [com]e as a surprise that
<br>
Max is English, someone who's left [the] old world behind and reinvented
<br>
himself on the edge of the Pacific. &quot;A late accident&quot; as far as his builder
<br>
father and [???] mother were concerned, Max grew up discon[nect]ed from his
<br>
older brothers, who are fundamentalist [Chr]istians, much to Max's bemused
<br>
horror.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[As] a child, Max read comic books. &quot;My favourites were [the] X
<br>
Men, perhaps because I felt like a bit of a mutant [mys]elf. I didn't fit
<br>
in. I used to sketch rocket boots when I [was] a kid. I just loved the idea
<br>
of having supernormal abili[ties]. I used to invent my own. I had a whole
<br>
book of them.&quot;
<br>
[Aft]er dabbling briefly in the occult in his early teens, Max [disc]overed
<br>
science fiction, anarchy, libertarianism, right-[win]g economics, and life
<br>
extension.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[&quot;]They seemed to share a common theme of overcoming [limi]ts and
<br>
increasing freedom - individual freedom, [free]dom from gravity, freedom
<br>
from death. Just what [was] needed in gloomy 1970's Britain, which was when
<br>
he [?] started to think about going to the United States. [It] was a
<br>
miserable decade. Everyone thought the world [was] going to end, the
<br>
economy was in a terrible state and [no] one was thinking about the future.
<br>
I couldn't seem to [talk] to people about the things I wanted to. They
<br>
thought I [was] too weird.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things didn't change when Max went to Oxford to study [phil]osophy,
<br>
politics, and economics in the mid-1980s. [Wh]ile doing his degree, Max
<br>
became the first person in [Eur]ope to sign up for cryonic suspension with
<br>
the US firm [Alc]or. Later Max headed off to do a philosophy PhD (on
<br>
personal identity) at Los Angeles University. It was there he [hook?]ed up
<br>
with Tom Morrow and the pair began to develop [the]ir Extropian ideas,
<br>
incorporating new technologies like [virt]ual reality, on-line communities,
<br>
and smart drugs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max may be a long way from his old home, but he plans on going a
<br>
lot further than America. Extropianism is a &quot;rational transhumanism&quot;, he
<br>
explains. There may not be any supernatural force in the universe, but
<br>
pretty soon, suggests More, once we get our brain implants and robot bodies
<br>
working, we will be as gods. In short, it's time to evolve beyond &quot;the
<br>
merely human&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making this kind of fantastic voyage will entail considering some
<br>
pretty radical ideas. For example, privatising the air, Max's answer to
<br>
worries about the environment advanced by eco-activists (great enemies of
<br>
the Extropian struggle who, he says, often deliberately exaggerate visions
<br>
of doom for their own purposes). &quot;We do need to be concerned about
<br>
environmental issues. Especially as Extropians, because we plan on living a
<br>
long time, and though we will go off into space, we plan on coming back
<br>
here, so we need to preserve this place. It's not our children and
<br>
grandchildren we're worried about. It's ourselves.&quot; Things might be helped,
<br>
he adds, if resources were privately owned. &quot;The oceans and the air -
<br>
anybody can pollute them without having to pay for it. Turn those commons
<br>
into privately-owned resources and there'd be more rational economic use of
<br>
them.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privatising the air is a typically Extropian solution to ecological
<br>
damage. They believe in a free-market future. In fact, Max tells me, his
<br>
economic ideas - currently enjoying a revival in the on-line world - are in
<br>
some ways being underwritten by new discoveries about self-organizing
<br>
systems and spontaneous order being made by researchers into complexity
<br>
theory. &quot;It all suggests that we need a dynamic system that can keep
<br>
reconfiguring itself, asystem without people in the middle telling
<br>
everybody else what prices to set or how to allocate resources or com[ing]
<br>
up with a national medical plan.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's these sort of ideas that crop up in the Extropian magazine,
<br>
which covers things like the physics of immortality, time travel, and
<br>
&quot;traversable wormholes and interstellar travel&quot;. Chief among the thinkers
<br>
is Robin Hanson. Flicking through Robin's thoughts on speeding up the
<br>
development of human thought by borrowing tricks from the stock market and
<br>
creating an ideas futures market[, or] reading his theories on what would
<br>
happen if uploading human consciousness became a reality, you start to feel
<br>
the ground shifting beneath you. But Extropians like Robin never look down.
<br>
Down isn't an Extropian direction. Down isn't in their dictionary, or if it
<br>
is, it's probably been turned into something more Extropian, like
<br>
&quot;anti-up&quot;, just as death tends to be talked of as &quot;de-animation&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why Extropians are most at home in the gravity-free world
<br>
of cyberspace, where it sometimes appears that the only limit to your
<br>
imagination is the size of your hard disk. But, argues Max:&quot;Everything I
<br>
publish in Extropy has to seem to me that it is within the bounds of
<br>
scientific possibility. I think the problem is that people don't
<br>
distinguish different kinds of far-outedness. In some senses, we're not
<br>
very far out at all. Our ideas don't require any new physics to work. We're
<br>
not far out in that sense. It's just that we follow chains of thinking much
<br>
further along than most people are prepared to go.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is an Extropian Institute, actually an office
<br>
upstairs at Max More's Marina Del Rey apartment, the real Extropian meeting
<br>
place is the on-line mailing list, where the most committed of the
<br>
movement's [me]mbers upload vast transhumanist tracts on a nightly [basis].
<br>
It's a sign of the times. In the past, avant-garde [grou]ps met up to
<br>
exchange philosophical theories and var[ious] resentments in pubs and
<br>
cafes. They toiled in isolation on [pa]mphlets and novels. Now they hook up
<br>
in cyberspace, [where] people of like minds from all round the world can
<br>
join [the p]arty, which means before you know where you have [a
<br>
mini-]movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Th]at's the theory, anyway. With Extropians, the stress would be on
<br>
&quot;mini&quot;. There are about 360 paid-up mem[bers], with another 500 checking
<br>
the mailing list. The [Extro]pian Institute is just scraping by, Max
<br>
admits. What to [do ab]out this is the subject up for discussion at a
<br>
meeting [of] LA Extropians, the reason why Jay Prime Positive, [Max] More,
<br>
Max's girlfriend Nancie Clark and others are [whi]ling a wet Sunday
<br>
afternoon crammed into Tim [Free]man's Culver City apartment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ch]at with an Extropian regular, Regina Pancake, whose [j]ob actually
<br>
involves building the future, or rather [ic]ons of the future. She works
<br>
for a company that makes [props?] for SF movies and TV, things like Star
<br>
Trek. Regina got involved in Extropianism about four years ago. [Like a]
<br>
lot of movement members, she came via cryonics, [which] she was drawn to
<br>
after a car crash. Shaken up, she [signe]d up to be frozen. &quot;With that,&quot;
<br>
she explains, &quot;you're directly hands-on with the attitude to incorporate
<br>
the [futur]e directly into your life.&quot;
<br>
[Th]e Extropians talk up plans for an Extropian book, [class]es in Future
<br>
Studies run by the Extropian Institute, an Extropian cable news programme,
<br>
which would [limit] the &quot;disasturbation&quot; of regular news and tell it like
<br>
it [is,] emphasise the advances in knowledge, recount [n]ew genes we
<br>
discovered since last week, or the new [???]-powered computer chip just
<br>
developed. It all sounds [strang]ely familiar, like a techno-obsessed
<br>
version of the [???] production reports once so popular in the Soviet
<br>
[Unio]n. But everyone seems so up, I don't want to rain on their parade.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[???] wants to bid goodbye to everyone with his own [versio]n of the
<br>
Extropian handshake, which ends with a [reach?] to the stars.
<br>
Unfortunately, the low ceiling in Tim's [???]e gets in the way. I go back
<br>
to Max and Nancie's [apart]ment, which is dominated by his sizable
<br>
collection of science-fiction paperbacks - which runs from Robert
<br>
[Hein]lein, the high-flying libertarian of Golden Age SF, to [Willi]am
<br>
Gibson, who max doesn't like much (too down - too many lowlifes in his
<br>
books) - and her vast paint[ings]. One wall is taken up with a
<br>
primary-colored vision of [Na]ncie and her best friend kitted out in
<br>
leotards, hair [fan]ning out in best shampoo-ad style, doing what seem[s]
<br>
to be zero-gravity aerobics just south of the rings of Saturn. [Na]ncie
<br>
talks me through another work upstairs which [featur]es a satellite, photos
<br>
of herself crawling along with [??]air, two friends making love in zero g,
<br>
and the Moon. [&quot;It's ] an allegory about evolution and communication,
<br>
[with?] humanity crawling up out of the mud,&quot; she explains. [Nanc]ie's
<br>
pictures are big but she hankers after something [on a] grander scale. She
<br>
wants to boundlessly expand her [art. L]et's face it - paint and canvas
<br>
aren't very Extropian. [What] she has in mind is a sort of astral
<br>
performance art, [erec]ting things on the face of the moon, deep space
<br>
[???]. &quot;Wouldn't that be incredible,&quot; she murmurs, as she [and M]ax embrace
<br>
and beam at the wonderment of it all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
[The] morning after the Extropian meeting, I visit [Max's] office. I
<br>
confess that I have a few problems with [Extro]py and Max calmly does his
<br>
best to help me work [throu]gh them. It may seem, he explains, that
<br>
Extropians [have] too much faith in the power of technology, that they've
<br>
[flown?] way too high on the freedoms and the possibilities you find [on
<br>
th]e Net, but all they're doing is trying out ideas, testing [theori]es.
<br>
They're aware that there may be problems. Max [in]sists that they aren't
<br>
really elitists, that they're open to [anyb]ody and that the future they
<br>
imagine won't just [sui]t the rich few in the West. Instead, over the long
<br>
run, [in the] Thatcherite tradition, it will trickle down to everyone.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Th]e funny thing about Max is that while his ideas are [???], he argues
<br>
them so calmly and rationally you find [yours]elf being drawn in. Cryonics
<br>
is not irrational, he tells [me, t]he objections to it are. He recalls how
<br>
his American [philo]sophy teacher dismissed it as ghastly but had to admit
<br>
[in the] end that she had no rational arguments against it. [&quot;Cryo]nics
<br>
just seems so rational to me. Which seems more ghastly? You're kept in
<br>
pristine condition, in a nice clean container, or you're thrown into the
<br>
ground where you decompose and the worms eat you. Or you're put into a big
<br>
burner and you're heated up until the pressure builds up in your skull and
<br>
your brain explodes.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max disagrees that the Extropian obsession with uploading
<br>
reveals a
<br>
hatred of the body - a trend that seems rife within techno-culture in
<br>
general. &quot;Well, I like my body a great deal,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't have any
<br>
problems with it. I'm not looking forward to getting rid of it. But
<br>
uploading isn't about getting rid of your body. People are going to want
<br>
new bodies. They'll just want their brains replaced with something more
<br>
effective.&quot;
<br>
<p>Effective is a word you could use to describe Romana Machado. When her name
<br>
comes up, Max says he'd rather I didn't interview her, that she's more into
<br>
self-promotion than Extropy. &quot;I think she thinks she's the Madonna of
<br>
Extropianism.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romana laughs at this suggestion. &quot;How about the Camille Paglia of
<br>
Extropy? I like that too. Maybe I'm a cross between Ayn Rand and Betty
<br>
Page.&quot; Though her name sounds distinctly Extropian, it predates her
<br>
interest in Max's theories. She changed her original a while back, taking
<br>
her new name from a sidekick of Doctor Who. &quot;On the Extropian mailing list
<br>
I'm called Mistress Romana, but only because of my rather dominant attitude
<br>
in argument.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romana works at Apple, ironing out the bugs in the Newton PDA, but also
<br>
subsidizes her Extropian lifestyle with a spot of glamour modeling -
<br>
lingerie catalogues, adverts for fetish clothing stores. She's just set up
<br>
The Exclave, an Extropian base camp in Sunnyvale, California, where she and
<br>
two Extropian partners, Dave Krieger and Geoff Dale, have decided to shack
<br>
up together in order to &quot;increase each other's productivity.&quot; Max had told
<br>
me that experimenting with your lifestyle - trying smart drugs,
<br>
visualization techniques, on-line identity play, non-traditional modes of
<br>
living - was a very Extropian thing to do. The posse at the Exclave are
<br>
taking him at his word. Romana especially.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm non-monogamous, but that doesn't mean I'm promiscuous,&quot; she tells
<br>
me.
<br>
&quot;I'm bisexual, but that doesn't mean I'm promiscuous either. What it means
<br>
is that I have the relationships I want with the people I want without
<br>
being stuck in this one form of sanctioned relationship, which in this
<br>
culture is marriage,serial monogamy, whatever.
<br>
There's more than one person that I'm serious about at any one given time
<br>
and I'm happy with that. It really works for me.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romana is best described as a hands-on Extropian. Along with her
<br>
housemates, she's a regular guest on a local talk radio station. The group
<br>
are also working on a book about Extropy, titled _Frequently Questioned
<br>
Answers_. Romana also released Stego, a free encryption programme which
<br>
works by hiding your information in the lower bits of seemingly
<br>
insignificant information. A very Extropian thing to do. &quot;To me the basic
<br>
activity is practically living according to my ideas,&quot; she says, directing
<br>
me to an essay on her World Wide Web page - &quot;Five Things You Can Do To
<br>
Fight Entropy Now&quot;. &quot;It's my action plan for what you can do in your life
<br>
right now in order to limit the incursions of entropy in your life, since
<br>
we can all have to deal with that. The five are: care for your mind, your
<br>
body, have a plan for your financial future, learn to defend yourself, and
<br>
get a cryonics contract.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how is the fight against entropy going? How post human is she? &quot;I'm
<br>
not
<br>
even thinking about being post human at this point. I'm just thinking about
<br>
being transhuman or pursuing my potential as a human. When we get to
<br>
posthuman, what that means is we'll have technically transcended the meat
<br>
bodies we have now and we'll be able to have the godlike powers and a
<br>
post-scarcity economy and any one of a number of things a[nd] powers.
<br>
That's not where I'm at now.&quot; So where does she think she'll be in the
<br>
future? &quot;I want to be the world's most beautiful 83-year-old woman,&quot; sh[e]
<br>
laughs. &quot;Actually, I hope that I've preserved myself so we[ll] that I'm a
<br>
testament to my own ideas.&quot;
<br>
<p>Back on Planet Earth, it may be hard not to dismiss the Extropians as
<br>
techno-nuts, as fanboys who have confuse[d] science fiction for science
<br>
fact, as cyberspace cadet[s] who've got way carried away in the digital
<br>
playpen of the Internet. They, in turn, would argue that they're too
<br>
avant-garde for the conservative mind-set. I'm not so sure. Han[g] out in
<br>
respectable American research labs and you hear scientists batting around
<br>
the same ideas. In fact, the[ir] extremism actually functions as a
<br>
revealing mirror to modern American techno-culture.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the future More dreams about - post-human transcendence, visiting
<br>
other galaxies, meeting copies of yourself - sounds like more fun than the
<br>
500-channel multi-media SuperHypeWay on offer from Bill Gates. Maybe the
<br>
Extropian's wildly rational speculations a[re] a challenge to corporate
<br>
America to live up to its digit[al] hype. Maybe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if you never do look down, gravity and reality never take hold.
<br>
Perhaps you just keep on going, upwards and outwards. And if you keep on
<br>
going, who knows where you might end up? Somewhere, perhaps, like the Far
<br>
Edge [P]arty, which Jay Prime Positive tells me about. When [we have]
<br>
figured out how to travel the galaxies and live fo[rever, ] Extropians will
<br>
set out to explore the universe. The plan [is] to meet up on the far edge
<br>
of the universe and swap traveller's tales, show slides, and the like.
<br>
&quot;That's kind of why I'm involved in Extropianism,&quot; Jay says. &quot;I think
<br>
they'll throw the best parties in the future.&quot;
