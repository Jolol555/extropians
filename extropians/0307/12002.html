<em>&gt; Alex [actually Mez] writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lee, I respect your opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, I can tell!  ;-)   No caps!  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>:)  Just to be clear, the line above attributed to Alex (and in the
<br>
rest of this post) was written by me, Mez. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; on this but I believe you're missing an important social dynamic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stranger yells 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at me, it will be counterproductive on their part.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that it is objectively determinable what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly stupid and despicable?  You make it sound very much as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you do.
</em><br>
<p>Just replace &quot;something truly stupid and despicable&quot; with &quot;something
<br>
that I, after thinking about it for a while, will decide is truly
<br>
stupid and despicable&quot;.  This is purely a post-hoc subjective
<br>
assessment on my part.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, the real dynamic is that he perhaps indeed should yell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at you---because evidently some of his friends are of such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intolerant dispositions, that his security, safety, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privileges, or fortune may be impaired if he doesn't learn to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mouth shut about some things.  This is, of course, the true 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious message communicated to those we shout down (or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to shout down):  Beware---be afraid.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps that's true for you.  But it varies from person to person.
<br>
For me, being yelled at by a stranger is a purely combative and
<br>
negative event.  On the other hand, being yelled at by someone I
<br>
trust, like, and respect is so startling and unexpected that it's like
<br>
having cold water thrown on my face.  It wakes me up and forces me to
<br>
re-evaluate what I just said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; friend of mine, someone who I respect, reacts with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obvious dismay and tells me quite strongly that what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've just said is dangerous, then I will take note.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Exactly.  Some ideas---alas even here---are just to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous to speak aloud.
</em><br>
<p>That's not what I said.  This was not about censorship. This was about
<br>
friends telling Robert that they were completely aghast at what he'd
<br>
suggested.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; My defenses may rise, but because I trust, like, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; admire the  person, I will listen.  Most importantly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I will realize that this is really an important 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; topic to them, and that I should devote some attention 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to their opinion.  If they had spoken mildly, I might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have missed that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, his primitive fear circuitry would not be aroused.
</em><br>
<p>Humans are emotional beings and communicate in emotional ways. Do you
<br>
deny this?  Do you believe that we'd be better off without any
<br>
emotional content in our communication?  I don't.
