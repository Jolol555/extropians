<p>We lack a full formal account, but I think we do have informal elements
<br>
of an account.  My guess is that on average the more good you actually
<br>
do for the tribe, the easier it is to have a high estimate for the good
<br>
you do for the tribe.  Thus people can take your high estimate as a
<br>
credible signal of a (lower) level of good you do.  Each person then
<br>
(unconsciously) trades off the social benefits from thinking they do good
<br>
from the costs of trying to have higher estimates than the evidence warrants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Robin thinks self-deception explains why people undergo journeys of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-discovery. But a simpler explanation may be that the optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weighting of health, comfort, status, etc., depends on the environment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one's genetic endowment, and the &quot;journey&quot; is just a process of figuring
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out the optimum.
</em><br>
<p>The question here is why humanity has not learned and passed down explicit
<br>
summaries of our basic preferences and how those depend on our
<br>
environments.  It could be that our environment-dependent strategies
<br>
are so vastly complex that mere minds like ours cannot fathom them.
<br>
But I was suggesting an alternative hypothesis.
