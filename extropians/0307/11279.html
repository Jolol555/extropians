<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   If a child is born healthy and normal, the probability that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   the mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 10%.  If a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   sickness of the mother, the probability that the mother had

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   rubella during her pregnancy is 50%. What is the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   that a child will be born with deformities if its mother had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;   rubella during her pregnancy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, Lee, it's perfectly straightforward to solve the problem from these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Observe:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(deformity) = 0.01
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(~deformity) = 0.99
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella|~deformity) = 0.1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella|deformity) = 0.5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella&amp;~deformity) = p(r|~d)p(~d) = .1*.99 = .099
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella&amp;deformity) = p(r|d)p(d) = .5*.01 = .005
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella) = p(r&amp;d) + p(r&amp;~d) = .104
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(deformity|rubella) = p(rubella&amp;deformity)/p(rubella) = .005/.104 = .048
</em><br>
<p>The problem is, as I think Dan has made you aware, that
<br>
you were assuming that &quot;deformities&quot; = &quot;deformities traceable
<br>
to a sickness of the mother&quot;.  By thinking immediately of the
<br>
odds ratio technique, you assumed that the problem was well-
<br>
formed and simple, and that necessarily would succumb to
<br>
just plugging in numbers in the usual way.  This prevented
<br>
you from actually reading all the statements carefully.
<br>
<p>Do you see which one is especially faulty here (at least in
<br>
your eyes)?
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may not be a good idea to read academic papers about Bayes before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having grasped Bayes,
</em><br>
<p>I shall &lt;sniff&gt; demand a formal apology for this slur.    8^D
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you look at the surrounding context, you will see that the problem they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are addressing is that some incorrect answers computed according to common 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect strategies are numerically close to the correct answer, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be confused with a &quot;Bayesian&quot; answer by some common experimental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques that accept answers as &quot;Bayesian&quot; if they are within a given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range of the correct answer.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, all right.  It just looks as though they are saying p(HD) != P(H)*p(D|H):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most frequent non-Bayesian algorithms they identified
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include computing p (H&amp;D) by multiplying p (H) and p (D | H);
<br>
<p>because they are giving points to the test-takers only for the
<br>
use of Bayes formula---and, apparently, only to using the
<br>
posterior/prior odds formulation of it no less---(and in a
<br>
faulty problem to boot).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee, Gigerenzer is extremely unlikely (prior probability) to be full of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shit.
</em><br>
<p>That's why it took me so long to figure out what was going on.
<br>
I couldn't believe that the problem---which I cut and pasted
<br>
for a class I was teaching---was bad.  Fortunately, the kids
<br>
I was teaching worked enough on other Bayesian word problems
<br>
along this line, and I never inflicted this on them.  (I nearly
<br>
did: &quot;Hey, I can't figure this one out, but maybe you can.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and then, if you are still interested in understanding the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between Bayesians and frequentists (which is something the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intro does not address), I would recommend reading the E.T. Jaynes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lectures given in the &quot;Further Reading&quot; section at the end of the intro. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jaynes gives specific examples of cases where frequentist methods are both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complicated than and inferior to Bayesian methods.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I've examined his book on-line, but then they took it offline
<br>
while the book was being printed.  Last time I checked, it was back.
<br>
But the book was supposed to be published this year (all 2000 pages
<br>
or whatever of it), and that's what I want to get.
<br>
<p>I do need better examples of where the Bayesians and non-Bayesians
<br>
disagree.  (I have wanted to be in on that controversy since 1972,
<br>
and always felt side-lined.)  I hope that not all Jaynes' examples
<br>
have to do with prior distributions, unbiased estimators,
<br>
transformations of likelihood, and so on.
<br>
