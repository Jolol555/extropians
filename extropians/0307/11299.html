<p>Sending the large quantities of information available to advanced

civilizations across interstellar distances is very hard (read &quot;expensive&quot;).
<br>
The best way is probably highly parallel arrays of &quot;lasers&quot; transmitting
<br>
at as high a frequency as possible (UV perhaps) directly to arrays of
<br>
receivers across as short a distance (e.g. some small number of light
<br>
years) as possible.  One probably can't easily get higher than UV
<br>
frequencies without risking destruction of either the transmitters
<br>
or receivers (UV photons have enough energy to break atomic bonds).
<br>
One might get around this if one had large arrays of nanobots around
<br>
to continually repair the equipment.  The only other possibility I
<br>
can think of is using free electron lasers to push up into the
<br>
X-ray region -- but the reciever architecture is going to be a
<br>
dicey exercise (look at the problems we have with the Chandra
<br>
X-ray observatory in focusing X-ray energy level photons, or the
<br>
problems we are having with X-ray frequency lithography).
<br>
<p>Interstellar communication of large amounts of data is going to
<br>
be a difficult problem to solve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What might be the best candidates for a means of inter-connectivity-

</em><br>
<p>No &quot;wharping&quot; unless you assume some fairly magic physics...
<br>
:-;
<br>
<p>Information communication via interstellar probes is probably at
<br>
least 10x slower, perhaps much more, than high energy photons and
<br>
still suffers from limits on the quantity of information that can
<br>
be sent.
