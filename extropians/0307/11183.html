<p>
These economic issues are complex and I am not too knowledgeable about
<br>
them, but I'll make a couple of quick points.
<br>
<p>Taxation is fundamentally a matter of redistribution.  It's not like
<br>
taxed money is not spent.  Government spends pretty much all the money
<br>
that it takes in taxes.  Give it back to people and they will spend some,
<br>
and save some.
<br>
<p>Generally, an economy is faced with the same basic question that a
<br>
person faces: how much to spend now, and how much to save for the
<br>
future.  For an individual, money saved (or invested) grows; hence he
<br>
will get more in the long run if he saves more, but this means delaying
<br>
his reward.
<br>
<p>For an economy, it's not quite the same, because most everything
<br>
that is produced gets used.  But where the analogous choice arises is
<br>
in allocating resources towards investing in capital-producing items,
<br>
versus producing short-term consumable items.  By investing in long term
<br>
growth items, society defers its current gratification and will produce
<br>
more in the long run.
<br>
<p>We know, therefore, how to increase growth in the long run: defer present
<br>
gratification.  At the individual level, save more of your income.
<br>
At an economic level, build more industrial robots and fewer CD players.
<br>
<p>The question is not really how to increase growth, in this crude model;
<br>
the question is whether to do so.  That is a matter of social values,
<br>
of how much we want the lives of our children to be better versus wanting
<br>
our own lives to be better.
<br>
