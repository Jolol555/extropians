<p><em>&gt; &gt; Sorry, but you are sounding like one of the usual apologists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for pain and suffering here.  There really isn't anything that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can be computed with pain that cannot be computed without it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it does sound like the standard apology. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But evolution and similar time-asymmetric complexity increases cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur unless 1) some information is erased to produce selection or 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is always more resources to encode information in.
</em><br>
<p>It's not clear to me that 1) always has to be true; but you
<br>
do a good job of delineating the possibilities here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The first case is the usual kind of evolution, or a M-brain doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error correction of its knowledge. The second one would be an expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technosphere never erasing anything
</em><br>
<p>Sounds great if one can afford it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (but remember the error correction part! that is still information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; erasure) but growing new memory to encode more and more variants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the earlier information patterns. But the second approach is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited by the speed of expansion and converts more and more matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into static memory; it is rather inefficient compared to a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where information is erased when it is no longer useful.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I will concede that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, pain might perhaps be replaced by non-pleasure. But in many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning rules there is an inherent difference between non-pleasure and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aversive experience, and it could be that the most efficient learning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules belong to this category. Then the issue becomes a choice between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain or lesser learning abilities. 
</em><br>
<p>It's been pointed out many times, I am sure, that the kinds of
<br>
minds we would like to become would still encounter disappointment
<br>
and frustration.  Fine.
<br>
<p>The aversive experience I have in mind is the hideous burden that
<br>
intelligent creatures continue to suffer under because they have
<br>
not yet gained control of their internal workings.  An extremely
<br>
stupid beast needs to be reminded not to kick certain kinds of
<br>
objects, for example, and extremely and long-lasting pain was
<br>
the most efficient teacher.  I propose to do away with all stupid
<br>
creatures, and, in fact, probably most matter that is not itself
<br>
intelligent and capable of getting along quite nicely without pain.
<br>
<p>I cannot imagine the case that you are discussing: namely, an 
<br>
intelligent entity whose learning is advanced by the kind of
<br>
pain experienced by lower animals and, sadly still, humans.
<br>
<p>David Pearce's message is so right and so important, that all
<br>
quibbles need to be swept aside www.hedweb.com
