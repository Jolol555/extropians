<p>
you :
<br>
This is also my view , that gravity being instantanious gives an
<br>
unbeatable method of information transfer. That is of course depending
<br>
on the propgation speed. Everything I have read thus far states that the
<br>
propogation is istantanious. I do have some serious worries about this
<br>
and will closely watch the results of any experiments that are
<br>
performed.
<br>
The only way I can easily except that the propogation is instananious,
<br>
is that every particle in the universe that exerts gravity. Is entagled
<br>
with every other particle. I can 'kind of' except this, baring in mind
<br>
that all the particles came from the sub-atomic soup that existed pre
<br>
big bang.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
I did spend a few brain cycles on a possible experiment utilising the
<br>
apparent ability of cryogenic superconducters to reduce gravity. I didnt
<br>
get very far due to the math and the constant nagging in the back of my
<br>
mind that if we mess around with gravity, we also mess with time and
<br>
have to somehow factor this into the eqautions. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
me:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't think sub atomic stuff existed pre big bang; I tend to view
<br>
matter from a semantic point of view;
<br>
which is to say, the particles that we observe are defined by their
<br>
relationships to other particles...and
<br>
that what we term matter is a predomiment form of energy because of its
<br>
stability, and the its immediate
<br>
measurability... its a hunch, or barring that being acceptable, a
<br>
theoretical model/construct thats proven to 
<br>
be quite useful without containing any (apparent to an educated layman)
<br>
flaws...  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In any event, the curvature of space is occurring daily :) So I'm not
<br>
worried (past some great catastrophe
<br>
like messing around with planet orbits or the like) about communication
<br>
using gravity pulses.  My current
<br>
research interests (which will be indulged [rigourously] shortly) are
<br>
leaning towards waves and waveguides...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There's some very interesting work being done on the subject, by a
<br>
physicist out of Columbia U., where
<br>
he's working on setting up a computer system to qualify stellar objects
<br>
based on the gravitational pulses
<br>
(for which he's built a particularly sensitive detector).... thats the
<br>
most similar research I've seen, minus the
<br>
speed of gravity propogation (which is largely theoretical at this
<br>
point).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In any event, thats what my money's on :)  That, or another really
<br>
interesting piece of research regarding
<br>
coupled photons emitted as part of some quantum event; they're coupled
<br>
because once you observe one,
<br>
the other immediately takes the opposite rotation or somesuch... if you
<br>
had a way of seperating such photons,
<br>
storing them, and then influencing their particular orientation, I
<br>
daresay you would have the beginnings
<br>
of a faster-than-light communication system.  the aforementioned effect
<br>
however, was only tested to
<br>
the distance of 3-4 meters or somesuch... you would still have to
<br>
distribute the photons though, between the
<br>
end parties :)  and for a really fun extra, the system would be
<br>
untappable (at least at current tech levels).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There's also another really interesting piece of research, out of
<br>
germany I believe... they were beaming
<br>
a source of light through an opaque material.... and they were depending
<br>
on a certain amount (relative to the
<br>
total amount) of light particles to tunnel through the material...
<br>
There's no reason why you couldn't set up
<br>
something similar and just toss out a lot of energy.... checksum and ack
<br>
the data as it arrives...  Supposedly
<br>
(since I don't subscribe to any physics journals yet), their work has
<br>
been independantly confirmed...
<br>
They played bach or somesuch over the carrier wave...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As to messing around with time through gravity, like I said, its
<br>
occurring daily :) I'm more worried
<br>
about identifying the particular signal over the noise more than
<br>
anything else :)
