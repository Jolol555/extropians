Brendan,
<br>
<p>Thank you for your post showing your concern about the quality of  the
<br>
list.  In your opinion, what specific posts are causes of the bickering?
<br>

Subject: flame wars
<br>
<p><p>The perspective of an infrequent poster:
<br>
<p>My reading of extropians has definitely fallen off seriously in the past
<br>
six months.  The bickering and sniping represents a large percentage of
<br>
the volume of the list.  It becomes tedious to have to slog through it to
<br>
figure out which discussions have content, and where that content is.
<br>
I've gotten a very good sense of which list members lie where on
<br>
the content-generation distribution, and I've killfiled a half-dozen
<br>
people--I've found that it's made the list much more readable.  But I
<br>
do consider unsubscribing pretty frequently.
<br>
<p>It's a shame--the list is so full of bright, ambitious people with
<br>
interesting and compelling visions of humanity's future, both near
<br>
and far.  But, as with every other online discussion forum I've ever
<br>
participated in, the more intelligent and ambitious we get, the more
<br>
childish, self-important and myopic we become when we feel our hard-won
<br>
and excruciatingly-thought-out paradigms being queried or challenged.
<br>
<p>One thing that frequently strikes me about the list is the degree of
<br>
arrogant certainty with which the list members state predictions of
<br>
the future.  Frankly, if anyone here could predict the future (or, hell,
<br>
even the present) with any degree of precision, they wouldn't have time
<br>
to sit around posting to this list, because they'd be spending every
<br>
waking moment _heavily_ involved in some other, extremely important works.
<br>
<p>So, yeah, it's a serious problem, and I think you'd see a lot less
<br>
attrition if it weren't.
