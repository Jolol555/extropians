</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Leonard Hayflick (and around 49 others) who seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doubt that immortality will ever be achieved. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please post this quote.  
</em><br>
<p>In the Epilogue p345 hardcover at bottom.
<br>
<p>&quot;Leonard Hayflick and a number of other prominent gerontologists 
<br>
have become so annoyed by the claims of life-extention enthusiasts 
<br>
that they recently prepared a manifesto. The document - written by
<br>
Hayflick, S. Jay Olshansky, and Bruce Carnes and signed by a
<br>
number of scientific luminaries, including Robert N. Butler, Steven
<br>
Austad, Tom Kirkwood, George Martin, Carol Greider, and Andrew
<br>
Weil - flatly asserts that dramatic increases in life span are unlikely.
<br>
&quot;The prospects of immortality,&quot; the scientists state, &quot;is no more likely
<br>
today than it ever has been, and it has no place in a scientific
<br>
discourse.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There was a &quot;position statement&quot; orchestrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Hayflick and two others and endorsed by 48 more, whose main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message was that *existing* so-called anti-aging medicine is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misnomer (which is why I was one of the 48), but which also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (because of the bias of the organising trio) touched on longer-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  prospects.  But Austad refused  to sign on.
</em><br>
<p>Ok this fits with the reference in the notes. &quot;The prospect of 
<br>
immortality&quot; : &quot;Position Statement on Human Aging,&quot; courtesy of
<br>
L Hayflick.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a better approach to attacking the anti-aging, problem has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggested by Aubrey de Grey and this better (in my view approach)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has not been addressed by Hayflick or Austad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Correct, but deserving of a comment.  Hayflick is simply very out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date on such issues and indeed has no real clue what I'm proposing in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the necessary degree of detail, despite having taken part in my second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roundtable (see my site <a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/</a> and the links
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the left).  Austad on the other hand is among the most optimistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the senior cadre of biogerontologists in his public statements: he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the one who said that the first 150-year-old is probably already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alive, and in fact he is now on record that the first 160-year-old is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably already 60.  He isn't really as up-to-speed on the details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what I propose, but he's definitely at my end of the spectrum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional biogerontologists, so if MoI implies otherwise he's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misrepresented.
</em><br>
<p>The quote above is verbatum so it does looks like it. Could be
<br>
Hayflick provided Hall with an incomplete or draft position 
<br>
statement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'd really love to see Aubrey discuss the ideas in his paper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; medicine ( <a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/manu16.pdf">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/manu16.pdf</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the likes of Hayflick and perhaps especially Steve Austad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This may happen soon (with someone on Hayflick's side but much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better informed and more influential).  Watch this space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The conventional approaches to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anti-aging are NOT going to lead to immortality or even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; serious extension of life-spans soon, but Aubrey's approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is more daring. Alas it is probably also a harder sell. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unclear.  I always maintain that the only constituency I really need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get on my side, publicly, is a respectable number of my colleagues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in biogerontology. 
</em><br>
<p>I was thinking of it as being a harder to sell to the general public (as
<br>
opposed to the Metheselah Mouse project which I think is excellent).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I'm progressing quite well in that regard -- the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conference coming up in Cambridge (<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/iabg10/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/iabg10/</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is another big step in that regard.  Once people like Austad start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoting my way of thinking on the TV, the war will be over.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be sooner than you think.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good :-)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is a comment in the back of MoI where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hall quotes Ali Brivanilou of the Rockefeller &quot;the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between mouse embryological development at the molecular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level and human development was &quot;night and day&quot;. &quot;Everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we know about the mouse, (embryologically), we already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know is not true for humans&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is (a) hyperbole, (b) embryology, and most important (c) it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science rather than intuition.  It doesn't matter a hoot how hard it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will actually be to translate late-onset mouse life extension therapy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to humans: what matters is that the general public will intuitively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel that it may be hard but there's a fighting chance that it'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible within a decade or two.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. A public that believes because of the Metheselah Mouse
<br>
project would be a formidable force to say the least. Your funding
<br>
problems would be over but I reckon the politics may still be
<br>
tricky. Still its a problem I'd *like* to have within the next two 
<br>
decades. Given two decades and any current IP quagmires will
<br>
hopefully have had sufficient time to have sorted themselves out
<br>
as well. In fact as cancer and gene therapy will require resolutions
<br>
before then I'd say the IP probs will be gone but the cost of any  
<br>
procedure will be pretty interesting. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That public intuition will force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public investment in pushing the effort to translate the technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to humans as fast as it can go.  How fast that is doesn't matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as the war on cancer is getting just as much money now as in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 70s despite having, shall we say, rather overrun its schedule.
</em><br>
<p>We're on the same page here :-)
