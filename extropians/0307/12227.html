<p>That's a good point... but it cuts both ways.  In the historical 
<br>
examples one never knows the complete context, whereas in the book one 
<br>
knows, or can know, the complete context.
<br>
However, I think the &quot;Ender's Game&quot; referred to above was actually a 
<br>
short story, or perhaps a novella.  It appeared in either Astounding or 
<br>
Analog.  The books followed decades later.  But the error was shown in 
<br>
the original story.  (I must admit I never read the expansions into books.)
<br>
<p>A part of the point of the original story was that some decisions must 
<br>
be made on the basis of incomplete information.  Whether a mistake was 
<br>
made or not depends on how you consider guessing wrong, when you emerge 
<br>
a victor.  If it doesn't bother you to have killed people needlessly, as 
<br>
long as you emerge triumphant, then I guess that no mistake was made.
<br>
<p>I do forget the details, though.  It's been decades, so I may have this 
<br>
confused with another, but I seem to remember that Ender was playing as 
<br>
the enemy, and was loosing, thought he had lost.  But his actions were 
<br>
being used to predict the actions that the Enemy would take.  So his 
<br>
side actually won.  And he emerged as a part of the victorious side that 
<br>
had destroyed the civilization that he had believed he was defending.
