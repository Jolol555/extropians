FWIW, my thought process:
<br>
<p>A priori probability is 50% for each barrel.
<br>
<p>For the red-majority barrel, the probability of
<br>
drawing a red each time is 3/4, blue 1/4; so
<br>
the odds of 3 blues, 7 reds is p1 = (1^3)*(3^7)/(4^10).
<br>
For the blue-majority barrel, it's p2 = (3^3)*(1^7)/(4^10).
<br>
<p>Therefore the overall probability (conditioning
<br>
on the 50-50 prior) is the average of those two
<br>
probabilities. A posteriori we know that this is
<br>
what happened, so the odds that it was the
<br>
blue-majority barrel are
<br>
<p>p2/(p1+p2) = 27/(27+2187) = 1/82
<br>
<p>I now think about doing it step-by-step, as originally
<br>
commanded. Intuitively, using the same averaging
<br>
principle as above, if you fish out a red,
<br>
that's a 3/4 probability that the bucket is
<br>
red-majority. But this suggests that the final
<br>
updated probability (of blue) will just be 3^3/4^10.
<br>
I stop, confused. That looks more like a number
<br>
you'd calculate 'in your head in less than thirty
<br>
seconds'. But what went wrong the first time?
<br>
<p>Nothing probably; what's wrong is the idea of
<br>
just multiplying all those retrodictive probabilities.
<br>
They need to be combined in some more complex way.
<br>
But what's the rule? Well, suppose that the current
<br>
probability assigned to the blue-majority hypothesis
<br>
is b, red-majority r. You draw out a blue. The odds
<br>
that you would draw a blue token from the blue-majority
<br>
barrel are 3/4, from the red-majority barrel 1/4.
<br>
So assuming the (b,r) prior, the odds of what just
<br>
happened are b*3/4 + r*1/4 = (3b+r)/4, and the odds
<br>
that it came from the blue barrel are 3b/(3b+r).
<br>
This is your new probability for the blue-majority
<br>
hypothesis. Updating in this fashion I get
<br>
<p>B 1/2, R 1/2;
<br>
(R) B 1/4, R 3/4;
<br>
(B) B 1/2, R 1/2;
<br>
(R) B 1/4, R 3/4;
<br>
(R) B 1/10, R 9/10;
<br>
(B) B 1/4, R 3/4;
<br>
(B) B 1/2, R 1/2;
<br>
(R) B 1/4, R 3/4;
<br>
(R) B 1/10, R 9/10;
<br>
(R) B 1/28, R 27/28;
<br>
(R) B 1/82, R 81/82
<br>
<p>and I also observe that one can begin by saying
<br>
that in the sequence blues and reds 'cancel' -
<br>
the barrels have equal probabilities of producing
<br>
a sequence with equal numbers of blues and reds -
<br>
so one need only ask the odds on getting four reds.
<br>
<p>But what I still don't get is what's wrong with
<br>
'orthodox statistics'. I obtained my p1/(p1+p2)
<br>
through frequentist thinking, which is supposed to
<br>
be anathema to Bayesians. On the SL4 list, Ben
<br>
Goertzel implies that &quot;non-Bayesian probabilists&quot;
<br>
are restricted in their choice of priors:
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0305/6820.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0305/6820.html</a>
<br>
<p>... but even if what he says is true, I don't
<br>
see it reflecting on the subjectivist-vs-frequentist
<br>
debate. Both sides need priors to get anywhere,
<br>
and there's nothing in frequentism to *compel* the
<br>
use of Gaussian priors. So, I still don't get the
<br>
philosophical lesson.
