<p><em>&gt; [Eliezer wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Historical villains have killed millions of people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrible causes, but the idea that it's too inconvenient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to think about the subject, and that dropping nukes would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; save time and aggravation, may well represent a new low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the human species.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, but the debate must change if the &quot;killing of millions of people&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in the name of a &quot;good&quot; cause.  I do not note in your message
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a schema for the valuation of &quot;lives&quot;.  Say even an AI life vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a human life.  This is not a new debate -- it goes way back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question of whether one has the right to kill (shut off, erase)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones copies -- (even *if* they have given you &quot;well informed&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permission to do so in advance).
</em><br>
<p>I would say that you might try to avoid thinking of &quot;rights&quot; in
<br>
the abstract---as you did in that last sentence---and then go on
<br>
to carefully distinguish between 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) what the legal rights of entities ought to be in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;society in your opinion
<br>
&nbsp;(ii) how you value various kinds of lives under varying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumstances, and what prescriptions you are prepared
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to give.
<br>
<p>and to realize that these are not at all the same thing.
<br>
<p>There are indeed cases, which SF authors often delight us with,
<br>
where one must decide the fate of millions.  In Enders Game,
<br>
for example, one has to decide whether killing millions of
<br>
aliens even to the point of complete genocide (because they might
<br>
kill you) is what you really approve of or not.  (It's really not
<br>
too different from deciding whether or not to invade a foreign
<br>
country because they might fabricate weapons that could destroy
<br>
you.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do agree that villains have abused their power and that millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent people have died as a result.  I would also probably agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that my suggestion would also result in similar negentropic casualties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the point I am trying to get at is *when* the negentropic losses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are acceptable?  Is the saving of a single human life worth a sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by humanity?  In medicine this is known as &quot;triage&quot; -- and it involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some very difficult decisions as to how one optimizes who one saves.
</em><br>
<p>You are quite right, of course.  I do not know if your suggestions
<br>
about Afghanistan and North Korea would be entropic or not, and 
<br>
neither does anyone else.  Of course, we are all entitled to our
<br>
opinions, and mine---for what it is worth---is that extreme acts
<br>
must be approached with the greatest caution.  Our intuitions and
<br>
traditions *usually* suggest such great caution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was trying to determine whether or not there is a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework for the net worth of human lives and whether that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifies a &quot;way of being&quot;?  For example, the Buddhist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective on &quot;lives&quot; provides a &quot;way of being&quot; -- the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic principles may not (at least in some aspects).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And perhaps more importantly the extropic perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may *never* generate a schema that trumps the Buddhist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective.  That is why I raised the question of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one achieves the shortest path to ones goals.
</em><br>
<p>I am not following you here at all.  For me, there are no
<br>
rationally arrived at &quot;moral frameworks&quot;---basically, one
<br>
consults his or her own intuitions on the matter, and 
<br>
attempts to make them as rationally consistent as possible.
<br>
It also helps one's intuition to consult the voices of 
<br>
others, including those long dead but whose wisdom is
<br>
widely respected.
<br>
<p>Gimme any scenario, and I'll tell you my answer.
<br>
<p>No, I would not nuke North Korea off the face of the world
<br>
at this time, although I would retain the capacity to do so,
<br>
and perhaps even make it clear that under *some* circumstances
<br>
I could be driven to do so.  But the present ones are far from
<br>
that, for me, and at this point the wisest thing to do seems
<br>
to be just to ride it out.
<br>
