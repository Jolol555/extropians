<p>
Name: Russell Evermore - Unbeliever and White Gold Wielder
<br>
<p>Location: Southern Vancouver Island
<br>
<p>Primary interests and activities: artist, hairstylist, grassroots
<br>
transhumanism, singularity studies, &gt;parenting, &gt;sex. I'm also interested,
<br>
however retro, in building friendships, associations, and infrastructures
<br>
spanning the divide between cyber and meatspace.
<br>
<p>How to help: Can you swing a hammer? Do you have a chainsaw? Interested in
<br>
meeting a really bright three year old?
<br>

<br>
<p>- Just one cubic centimeter of computronium to do with what I will. I
<br>
promise to strive to be an ethical god, but I'm still going to have some
<br>
fun.
