<p><em>&gt; &gt; What possible incentive do government employees have to cut spending?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, to be clear, I wasn't saying that *government employees*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as opposed to government ministers), either as a class, or as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals do have such an incentive....
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; A minister hands down a need to a department head for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% cut and the department head looks for the ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realise that cut or tries to oppose the cut as the department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head sees fit. Some negotiation may ensue by a competent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department head will at least go back to the minister armed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with information that supports his case.  The department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head sends a message down to his/her subordinates look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways to cut costs. Those that find them, perhaps at pointing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out inefficiencies due to technological change that make say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few old clerical types redundant will probably be rewarded. 
</em><br>
<p>Oh, they'll be rewarded all right: probably a larger
<br>
office, and a few new and extra subordinates.  All 
<br>
at taxpayer expense, of course.  No actual savings
<br>
will occur except in vanishingly few instances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human nature being what it is not all the recommendations for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employee cuts will be motivated by the higher good.
</em><br>
<p>With almost superhuman effort, I refrain from the requisite
<br>
sarcastic comment here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some will want to settle old scores, remove competitors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the opportunities in the restructure to alter their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitive position.
</em><br>
<p>Say it's not so!
<br>
<p>(After all, I'm only human.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am inferring from your question a view that government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employees see themselves as a class and that their class 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loyalties are not easily shaken up. I think this is mistaken.
</em><br>
<p>No, I was not thinking that at all.  They were and are
<br>
firmly, IMO, putting #1 ahead of every other consideration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Other loyalties in the case of almost all individuals that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen to be government employees, such as loyalty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to oneself, one's family, one's friends, and even to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideal of good public service will in some cases if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost all cases be stronger.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'd rank them like this:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. how does the change affect ME?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. how does the change affect ME?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. how does the change affect ME?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. how does the change affect ME?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. how does the change affect ME?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. how does the change affect my retirement?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. how does the change affect my cronies?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. how does the change affect my boss?
<br>
etc. etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. how does this affect my political party?
<br>
and finally,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;73. how does this affect my world or the country.
<br>
<p>Number 86, &quot;how does this live up to my ideal of 'good public service'
<br>
is not on my list because government bureaucrats quickly lose their
<br>
youthful and naive ideals.
<br>
