<p><em>&gt; I asked my neighbor who has children, and learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that things are a bit different today than the 60s,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we were children.  Kids today are not allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to thrash, threaten and abuse each other the way they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did back then.  The schools now are much more conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of legal liability should little Johnny come home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a bloody nose or broken tooth.
</em><br>
<p>Southern California evidently was not like your Florida.
<br>
Four years at one elementary school resulted in, I think,
<br>
two fights, neither of which actually landed blows.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my own misspent youth, the students were allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yea encouraged) to beat each other early and often.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For this would result in their becoming practiced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and confident fighters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The notion in those years of peace, love and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding was that this old world would be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or less at war constantly until the nuclear holocaust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ended our strife forever.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that was the sixties all right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until that time of course there would be a persistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for soldiers, whose fighting skills were honed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an early age whether they liked it or not.
</em><br>
<p>My theory is that the newer the school or schools,
<br>
(a) the less time cliques have to build up  (b)
<br>
the less other bad old traditions (like stomping
<br>
and shoving people into toilets) have to build up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It could be that most kids now go thru their entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school years without ever having their heads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dunked into the toilet, and perhaps without even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hazing or beating.  Their resulting inability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight is perhaps what is pushing ever more advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanization of warfare.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, but I think that it is more likely that the
<br>
inability to take casualties is what is pushing rich
<br>
nations to mechanization.  At one solder lost a day,
<br>
it will take approximately a hundred years for the
<br>
American troops in Iraq to be cut by ten percent, but
<br>
the country will not be able to endure such &quot;horrific&quot;
<br>
losses for many more months.  And Saddam Hussein knows
<br>
it, and I guess that this was his strategy all along
<br>
when he found they really were going to depose him.
