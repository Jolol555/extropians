<p>but, spike, the dude doesn't claim that solar sails break the first law
<br>
of thermodynamics (energy conservation). he claims the second (getting
<br>
work done at 100% efficiency) would be broken.  I don't know enough
<br>
physics to tell wether he's right or not, but his basic argument seems
<br>
to be: solar sail starts propulsing =&gt; solar sail gets hot =&gt; solar sail
<br>
stops working... alejandro
<br>
<p>Ja, I saw that, but thought the argument too silly
<br>
to take seriously.  A thin sheet of mylar in space
<br>
doesn't get very hot, even when reflecting sunlight
<br>
continuously.  It doesn't reflect *all* the light
<br>
falling upon it of course, only about 90% or in the 
<br>
high 80s.
<br>
<p>The really high frequencies pass right thru.  Some
<br>
of the energy is converted to heat, which is 
<br>
radiated from the shade side into cold space.  
<br>
<p>So a solar sail isn't a perfect reflector, and no, it
<br>
doesn't get so hot it stops working, I can assure you,  
<br>
nor does this violate the second law of thermodynamics.  
<br>
I don't even understand the argument in light of the 
<br>
fact that we have *plenty* of data on what happens to 
<br>
reflective surfaces in space, plenty.  In fact, Amara's
<br>
interplanetary dust is blown outta the solar system by 
<br>
the same mechanism which Gold is questioning.  Good 
<br>
thing too, otherwise we would be choking on the stuff 
<br>
by now.
<br>
<p>Actually, Dr. Gold is smart enough to know all of this.  
<br>
I don't know what his game is.  He is intentionally 
<br>
playing with our heads for some reason.
