<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;...Just breed a dominant clade that dislikes human smells and blood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, this solution might be interpreted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some misguided souls as cruelty to animals.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Sure. Childless mosquito couples are a tragedy, much worse than 
<br>
killed mosquitos. But mosquito scientists are working on in vitro 
<br>
hatching.
<br>
<p><p>No, what I meant was that humans would be selfish
<br>
to take care of their own while cheerfully allowing 
<br>
the other animal species to suffer from the mosquitos.
<br>
But now that I think about it, I do not recall seeing
<br>
mosquitos hanging around my dogs, so perhaps most
<br>
mammals' fur is sufficient to protect their skin.
<br>
This observation causes me to wonder what happened
<br>
to our fur?  How could it have evolved away, when
<br>
it has so many clear advantages?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p>I just realized that the biggest fault in my scheme is that I actually
<br>
have to let the mosquitos bite me and escape unscatched for it to work!
<br>
Talk about cruelty to animals - me! They are violating my
<br>
self-ownership! My blood is mine! All mine! :-) Anders Sandberg
<br>
<p><p><p>Ah Anders, surely we could work out an arrangement where
<br>
outdated pints in the bloodbank could be converted
<br>
into hordes of sterile or non-human-blood-lusting
<br>
mosquitos.  
<br>
<p>I favor the notion however that humans could 
<br>
eventually eliminate mosquitos from the planet, 
<br>
should we determine to do water control correctly.  
<br>
Perhaps this attitude comes from having grown up in 
<br>
Florida, where the old-timers would absolutely marvel 
<br>
at how successful the state's mosquito control efforts 
<br>
have been.  They have not been eradicated, but the
<br>
absolute number of mosquitos has dropped to perhaps
<br>
10% what they were in the 1920s.  I may be wrong but
<br>
my perception is that the problem has dropped in half
<br>
since my own childhood in the 60s.  Water control is
<br>
the key to bug control.  spike
