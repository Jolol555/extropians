</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think the decision theory approach is relatively promising.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that the axioms really declare that we don't care about counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worlds.  In the end, it's true, we conclude that rationally we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;act as though the standard QM &quot;Born&quot; probabilities hold and ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the simple mechanism of counting worlds.  That is a deduction from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;axioms and is therefore implicit in them.  But the axioms are intended
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to present a plausible definition of what constitutes rational behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They don't start right off declaring that we ignore world counts.
</em><br>
<p>But they don't seem very plausible to me.  They are just what you need
<br>
to get the Born rule.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A simpler approach just occured to me.  Let's consider a photon which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emitted in a polarized state and encounters a polarizer tilted to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a 10% chance of passing.  As Damien describes, if each photon splits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world into two, then the fraction of worlds that see the 10/90
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probabilities becomes vanishingly small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But does it really split like this?  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... even a single emission and polarization-measurement of a photon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not actually split the universe into two parts; it splits it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an infinite number of parts.  Even if it turns out that photon emission
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not truly continuous, that it can only happen at multiples of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Planck time or whatever, that's still a truly enormous number of parts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And the point is that among this humongous split, 10% of the universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will see the photon pass through the polarizer, and 90% will see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be absorbed.  Given this reality, a simple counting rule does in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reproduce the Born probabilities.  It was only because we abstracted away
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the enormous additional complexity of the world in order to focus on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;polarizer interaction that we thought the universe split into two just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two branches.
</em><br>
<p>You say it works in this example, but I don't see it.  Can you show us
<br>
explicitly how you can calculate your 10%/90% figure in this example.
