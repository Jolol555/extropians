<p><em>&gt; &gt; It would be idiotic IMO to try to place probabilities on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these possibilities or tendencies, so one should have to ponder it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and length, and perhaps talk to others to gain the advantage of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking and experience before making a decision.  Clearly, I ought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to go kill him if there is a very large chance he will ambush me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; later.  Moreover, since you bring up his past misdeeds, there looms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the large possibility that we should jail or execute this person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, this [ambush likely] scenario is not sufficient reason to kill another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human being in a civilized society.   What does talking to a bunch of other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people have to do with the clear issues and principles at hand?
</em><br>
<p>I think that you didn't get the hang of Barbara's examples.  She
<br>
was not talking about civilized societies.  (Otherwise, the simple
<br>
solution to her thought-experiments was to just call the police.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It depends on a number of things: firstly, what do I gauge will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this person's reaction to the fact that I have a shotgun and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am inclined to use it on him if he proceeds unjustly with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; machete?  Let us suppose that this would sober him up, and moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that he's not the type to sneak up on me and kill me later on.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moderation seems the best course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not moderation.  It is simply sane. Blowing him away without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient evidence to convict on suspicion is highly unjust and itself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal and actionable malice.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you would like to go back and address the cases where
<br>
no one will use a judiciary to prosecute &quot;actionable&quot; and
<br>
malicious acts, but rather deal with the hypothesis that one
<br>
is living in a more primitive society.
