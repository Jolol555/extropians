<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What possible incentive do government employees have to cut spending?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; First, to be clear, I wasn't saying that *government employees*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (as opposed to government ministers), either as a class, or as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals do have such an incentive....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A minister hands down a need to a department head for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 10% cut and the department head looks for the ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realise that cut or tries to oppose the cut as the department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; head sees fit. Some negotiation may ensue by a competent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; department head will at least go back to the minister armed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with information that supports his case.  The department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; head sends a message down to his/her subordinates look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ways to cut costs. Those that find them, perhaps at pointing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out inefficiencies due to technological change that make say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a few old clerical types redundant will probably be rewarded. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, they'll be rewarded all right: probably a larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office, and a few new and extra subordinates.  All 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at taxpayer expense, of course.  No actual savings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will occur except in vanishingly few instances.
</em><br>
<p>Then are other ways. They may just get to keep their job
<br>
and be in line for vacancies when they open up. Btw. Top
<br>
public service jobs in Oz are often contracts now. That puts
<br>
a slightly different spin on things. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Human nature being what it is not all the recommendations for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; employee cuts will be motivated by the higher good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With almost superhuman effort, I refrain from the requisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sarcastic comment here.
</em><br>
<p>You lost me Lee. Where are you going? I said there are two
<br>
ways of delivering tax cuts. 1) cutting spending and 2) returning
<br>
bracket creep. Then *you* asked why would government
<br>
employees support cuts. Which wasn't what I said, but I thought,
<br>
what the hell, here are some reasons why some might anyway.
<br>
<p>When I don't know if you are serious or not I am completely
<br>
immune from sarcasm so go ahead if you feel like it. I can 
<br>
imagine too many sarcastic comments at too many tangents.
<br>
It would have been better to narrow it to one. At least
<br>
I'd know what your are talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some will want to settle old scores, remove competitors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use the opportunities in the restructure to alter their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; competitive position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say it's not so!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (After all, I'm only human.)
</em><br>
<p>In some cases it *is* so. (Double sarcasm if you like ;-)
<br>
<p>*You* asked the question!? What gives?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am inferring from your question a view that government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; employees see themselves as a class and that their class 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; loyalties are not easily shaken up. I think this is mistaken.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I was not thinking that at all.  They were and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firmly, IMO, putting #1 ahead of every other consideration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Other loyalties in the case of almost all individuals that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happen to be government employees, such as loyalty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to oneself, one's family, one's friends, and even to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideal of good public service will in some cases if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; almost all cases be stronger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'd rank them like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             1. how does the change affect ME?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             2. how does the change affect ME?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             3. how does the change affect ME?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             4. how does the change affect ME?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             5. how does the change affect ME?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             6. how does the change affect my retirement?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             7. how does the change affect my cronies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             8. how does the change affect my boss?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;            26. how does this affect my political party?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and finally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;            73. how does this affect my world or the country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 86, &quot;how does this live up to my ideal of 'good public service'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not on my list because government bureaucrats quickly lose their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; youthful and naive ideals.
</em><br>
<p>Well I'm not quite that cynical. Peoples positive views of themselves 
<br>
are something they sometimes want to retain too. There probably
<br>
is such a thing as someone wanting to do a real public service all
<br>
things being equal. 
<br>
<p>Anyway I thought *you* were the one that believed in altruism. 
<br>
<p>Brett
