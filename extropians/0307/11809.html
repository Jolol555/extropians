<em>&gt; No, I'm suggesting that the philosophical argument, the question of whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers are capable of genuine thought, is no basis for a research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programme.  (To be honest, I don't think it's even really interesting as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy.)  If you want to create a brain, study the brain.  The idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we can simply sit down and program &quot;thought&quot; is absurd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Really?  Well, wait and see.  Programming thought, btw, is not too precise a 
<br>
description of what is being attemtped.  As for the philosophical question, 
<br>
an existence proof beats the hell out of tomes of well-reasoned argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a difficult issue.  My partial solution is to argue that death, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an event, is culturally determined, and to ask that our view be given as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much consideration as the &quot;death is inevitable/desirable&quot; view, under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auspice of the prevailing pluralism in society.  Avoiding senescence would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a choice and a choice that casts itself as somewhat arbitrary, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a goal we apply to all humanity (the &quot;millions of lives will be lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless we cure aging&quot; mentality).  This requires two things: (1) greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of what I just described as the &quot;death is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable/desirable&quot; view; and (2) a more detailed account of our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position and how it relates to the prevailing cultural situation.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricky part is how to inaugerate our &quot;sub-culture&quot; without appearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant; jettisoning the (mock) horror and confusion we feel at the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some people want to die is only the start.  My own hope is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tension between wanting to get the word out, to secure funding, etc, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanting a morally defensible exclusionary practise (so we don't just seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a bunch of arrogant Westerners who want to live forever while half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is starving) will be alleviated simply by elucidating our position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My feeling is that our goals here aren't a simple product of hubris.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The pioneers will always appear arrogant to any who wish to stay at home or 
<br>
not rock the boat as hard.  So what?    Why waste time attempting to 
<br>
understand why some believe death is inevitable?  It appears to be by default 
<br>
now.  Perhaps it would be better to show that if there are not full 
<br>
alternatives that it can at least be postponed for quite some time.   The 
<br>
argument that death is a good thing, which is a view held by many, is more 
<br>
interesting.  The speaking of the flesh, our programming, versus actual 
<br>
reasons for this position need to be fruitfully understood if we are to 
<br>
answer any objections and enroll more people in expanded life.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The telephone is inanimate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A book is inanimate.  Yet it embodies the ideology of its author, its time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its culture.  Of course, the book is a particular kind of artifact designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to communicate, but I doubt anyone now thinks a book communicates only that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it was specifically designed to communicate.  It's a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension to suggest a technology, designed with a particular function in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, brings with it certain other &quot;functions&quot; reflective of the time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place of its inception.  Usually these cultural biases are ascribed, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, through certain notions of efficiency and optimality.  When a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology is transplanted from one culture to another, the result is far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complicated than a simple &quot;progress.&quot;  (We can accept this while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejecting the stronger thesis that there is no such thing as progress.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To some extent but not to the extreme extent most followers of such reasoning 
<br>
take it.
