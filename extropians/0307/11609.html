(sorry if this is a duplicate.  I got a mail error back on this so I am
<br>
resending it.)

<em>&gt; What Harvey is referring to by &quot;this level of coordination&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc., is an incident that resulted from his complaining to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the then-current list monitor of personal attacks.  His story
</em><br>
<p>No, that is NOT what I am referencing.  Your version is a little distorted.
<br>
I was referring to the attackers' coordination, not the victims.
<br>
<p>For the record, I have never made any complaints in which I was the target
<br>
of an attack.  All my complaints were prompted by other people's complaints
<br>
to me offlist or their complaints publicly made on the list.
<br>
<p>For the record, I was not originally involved in any of the flame-war
<br>
threads about any of the original topics.  My only involvement was to stop
<br>
ad hominem.  My only participation in flame wars were about the metatopic of
<br>
moderating itself.
<br>
<p>For the record, all my complaints were summarily dismissed by the
<br>
moderator(s) previous and current.  I was told that I could not complain on
<br>
behalf of others.  I have consistently refused to complain on behalf of
<br>
myself to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.  During my decade
<br>
on this list, I have never had any complaint accepted by any moderator.
<br>
<p>Remember that we had no moderator at the time of these events.  It wasn't
<br>
until I pointed out that the list rules required people to take arguments
<br>
off-line and contact the moderator that we discovered that there wasn't one.
<br>
When the new moderator was appointed (Hal), he said he would not delve into
<br>
previous attacks, nor would he stop new attacks without complaints, nor
<br>
would he accept any complaints from me or anybody on behalf of others.  In
<br>
short, I am not aware that Hal has done any moderating or accepted any
<br>
complaints.  In fact, I am not aware of any moderator doing any moderating
<br>
or accepting any complaints for many years now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, Mike, I don't think that it was really a big deal, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxing for those of us worrying that finally after all these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years maybe speech on the Extropian list would not be free. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But free it has remained, not surprisingly.
</em><br>
<p>There is no free speech on this list while members report that they are too
<br>
afraid to speak publicly for fear of personal attacks.  We lose more speech
<br>
when people drop out, stay silent, or curtail their own speech than we gain
<br>
by allowing insulting and ad hominem speech to continue.  Flame-wars do not
<br>
encourage free speech and participation, they suppress it.
