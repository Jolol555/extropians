<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:ag24@gen.cam.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20[GKES]%20figuring%20out%20just%20what%20everyone%20is%20here%20is%20doing%20to%20bring%20on%20a%20better%20world">ag24@gen.cam.ac.uk</a>
<br>
<p>Activities: I work on expediting the development of &quot;real anti-aging
<br>
medicine&quot;, i.e. therapies that will genuinely and indefinitely extend
<br>
healthy human life expectancy.  I don't do lab work; instead I publish
<br>
proposals for such therapies based on other people's work.  My other
<br>
projects/initiatives in this area include co-administering a prize for
<br>
the development of progressively longer-lived mice (the Methuselah
<br>
Mouse Prize), organising conferences focused on research to develop
<br>
real anti-aging medicine, and soliciting serious money for the founding
<br>
of an institute to get such research done more quickly.
<br>
<p>Key web sites/pages:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/</a>       All my published work, reports
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on past conferences, etc
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.methuselahmouse.org/">http://www.methuselahmouse.org/</a>      Methuselah Mouse Prize
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/iabg10/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/iabg10/</a>     Upcoming conference
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/IBGcase.htm">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/IBGcase.htm</a>    Proposed institute
<br>
<p>How to Help:
<br>
<p>IF YOU'RE A BIOLOGIST: come to the conference in September, or if you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can't do that then read my papers on the technologies we need to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop in order to cure aging and start work on your favourite one.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and let me know, so that I can put you in touch with others who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are working on the same field.
<br>
IF YOU'RE A JOURNALIST: write about my work, but perhaps even more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;importantly interview other mainstream biogerontologists (the more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;senior and high-profile the better) and ask them to explain why they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't think we'd cure aging any time soon by the approach I advocate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And also come to the conference in September.
<br>
IF YOU'RE WEALTHY: contribute to the Methuselah Mouse Prize fund, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask me what research you could productively fund.
<br>
IF YOU'RE EXTREMELY WEALTHY: ask me more about the proposed Institute
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Biomedical Gerontology.
<br>
WHOEVER YOU ARE: talk to your friends/family/colleagues about what life
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be like without aging and find out what they don't like about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the idea.  Get better at rebutting their arguments.
