At 04:46 PM 7/24/2003 +0200, Alfio pointed us to:
<br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm">http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>His predictions about future progress in robotic technology are not crazy,
<br>
even if they are not assured.  He ignores the software problem - even if
<br>
robots have more computing power than the brain, it may take a while for
<br>
software to be good enough.  But it is not crazy to think the software
<br>
problem might be solved within a decade or two of when we have enough
<br>
hardware.
<br>
<p>His social predictions are more of a mixed bag.  He may in fact turn out to
<br>
be right in his specific predictions, but if so it will partly due to luck;
<br>
he doesn't show much indication that he understands the sort of economic
<br>
analysis that is most appropriate to considering such situations.  Alas, his
<br>
is the sort of analysis that shows up time and again among technologies
<br>
who understand robotics far better than they understand social science.
<br>
<p>For example, he doesn't consider that people who leave some jobs might find
<br>
others.  Automation has taken away most farming jobs, but that hasn't made
<br>
most people unemployed; people now do other things that they do better than
<br>
machines.  Similarly most economists are not worried because for the last
<br>
few centuries machines and human labor have mostly been *complements*.  This
<br>
means that the more efficient one of them becomes, the more valuable the
<br>
other becomes.  So as machines take over some jobs, that had *raised* the
<br>
value of, and hence the wages given to, the other jobs people still do.  So
<br>
most people remain employed, and focus on the tasks machines are worse at.
<br>
<p>However, a closer examination does I think suggest that eventually machines
<br>
will become mostly substitutes for, rather than complements of, human labor.
<br>
I present my argument for that position in this technical paper:
<br>
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf</a>  The basic idea is that types of tasks are
<br>
complements to each other, but that machines can substitute human labor for
<br>
any given task.  My argument isn't necessarily widely accepted though.
<br>
(The strongest case for substitution comes I think in the case of uploads.)
