-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Andrew Clough...
<br>
<p>...Still, it seems absurdly anthropomorphic to claim that we are rushing
<br>
in to 
<br>
save the Earth just in time...
<br>
<p><p>The term anthropomorphic isn't the one you are
<br>
looking for perhaps, which means assigning human-like
<br>
characteristics to animals, such as Bambi-izing deer.
<br>
<p><p><p>...When the solar system (and galaxy and...) 
<br>
blooms we'll be able to claim credit, but even if every human alive were
<br>
<p>killed off instantly, I bet another species could evolve to intelligence
<br>
<p>before the big ice comes...
<br>
<p><p>We needn't assume intelligence is necessary.  I
<br>
could imagine some kind of bug or worm that somehow
<br>
manages to dig its way down to the oil fields or
<br>
coal seams and break down that carbon.  
<br>
<p>But it does leave some questions, such as why was 
<br>
it so late in the game before a archaeo-carbon
<br>
scavenger evolved?  Carbon based life on this
<br>
planet was already very much in decline before
<br>
the last few thousand years when human started
<br>
digging coal, and the last couple hundred when
<br>
we started pumping oil.  Perhaps the fact that
<br>
we came late suggests that it is not at all
<br>
inevitable that any archaeo-carbon scavenger
<br>
arise in the general history of life, and that
<br>
most planets are not thus rescued.  We may
<br>
go to other planets and find that the most
<br>
common case is for the planet to be sterile,
<br>
yet have fossil rich carbon layer somewhere
<br>
below the surface.
