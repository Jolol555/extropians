<p>As it happens, I am 20 right now, and have been following this list for
<br>
a few years, and into the ultratechnology thing for somewhat longer. I
<br>
am not a big-E Extropian, but I very much admire the pursuit of extropy.
<br>
This list and all the peripheral transhumanist literature have been a
<br>
big influence in choosing a career, and as someone (Damien B, I believe)
<br>
suggested in the what-can-I-do thread, I'm going to be a mathematics
<br>
teacher.
<br>
<p>I would be proud to work in materials science or molecular biology, or
<br>
any other field with direct high-tech applications, but maths is what I
<br>
like and it's what I'm best at. Pure mathematics research is as much as
<br>
I'm capable of in the short term future, and I don't see it contributing
<br>
much to anything besides a few intellectual bragging rights. Aside from
<br>
the fact that I would very much enjoy teaching, the best contribution I
<br>
can hope to make to the extropian &quot;cause&quot; (if you'll excuse the cult
<br>
language) is education: an educated mind possesses more extropy than an
<br>
uneducated one. Besides the innumerable benefits of having more smart
<br>
people around, there's a chance that a few of the thousands of
<br>
impressionable young minds I'll be in contact with will go on to become
<br>
the superstar researcher that I'm not willing or able to be.
