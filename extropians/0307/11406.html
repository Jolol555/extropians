An Op-Ed piece by Daniel Dennett today in the New York times is worth
<br>
sharing on this list.
<br>
<p>The time has come for us brights to come out of the closet. What is a
<br>
bright? A bright is a person with a naturalist as opposed to a
<br>
supernaturalist world view. We brights don't believe in ghosts or elves or
<br>
the Easter Bunny - or God. We disagree about many things, and hold a variety
<br>
of views about morality, politics and the meaning of life, but we share a
<br>
disbelief in black magic - and life after death.
<br>
<p>The term &quot;bright&quot; is a recent coinage by two brights in Sacramento, Calif.,
<br>
who thought our social group - which has a history stretching back to the
<br>
Enlightenment, if not before - could stand an image-buffing and that a fresh
<br>
name might help. Don't confuse the noun with the adjective: &quot;I'm a bright&quot;
<br>
is not a boast but a proud avowal of an inquisitive world view.
<br>
<p>You may well be a bright. If not, you certainly deal with brights daily.
<br>
That's because we are all around you: we're doctors, nurses, police
<br>
officers, schoolteachers, crossing guards and men and women serving in the
<br>
military. We are your sons and daughters, your brothers and sisters. Our
<br>
colleges and universities teem with brights. Among scientists, we are a
<br>
commanding majority. Wanting to preserve and transmit a great culture, we
<br>
even teach Sunday school and Hebrew classes. Many of the nation's clergy
<br>
members are closet brights, I suspect. We are, in fact, the moral backbone
<br>
of the nation: brights take their civic duties seriously precisely because
<br>
they don't trust God to save humanity from its follies.
