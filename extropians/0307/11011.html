</em><br>
<p>You certainly do exist, just as everyone you interact with does exist.  But
<br>
I'm guessing you have no evidence or experience that *they* possess a &quot;self&quot;
<br>
beyond the processes of their brain interacting with their environment.  No
<br>
need for a special soul there, right?  It's just that hard to explain but
<br>
certain feeling inside *you* that you are unique, right?
<br>
<p>Have you ever had a dog?  I've always lived with dogs and other animals, and
<br>
I remember being about seven or eight years old and being told that people
<br>
have souls and real feelings, but that animals have only instinctive
<br>
behaviors. For me that provided a great focus on the contradictions of the
<br>
so-called &quot;problem of consciousness&quot;.  It is clear from their behavior that
<br>
there is a range of consciousness among animals, all of which consist of
<br>
nothing but material atoms, but which have varying types of evolved brain
<br>
structure.
<br>
<p>None of this is proof in the ultimate sense, but perhaps by looking at
<br>
things from a wider view (imagine looking at all of this from above, rather
<br>
than through your own eyes), and seeing how many pieces of the puzzle fit
<br>
together, you will become comfortable with a more cohesive view of reality
<br>
that does not postulate the existence of a special component called
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>Certainly consciousness is a real phenomenon, as a description of a part of
<br>
the functioning of our brain.  It can also be interesting to philosophize
<br>
about the idea that consciousness can be considered to exist within narrower
<br>
or wider domains (for example, the idea of &quot;group consciousness&quot; which seems
<br>
to me just as real as personal consciousness.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can only find paradox at the base of any search for an explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the only phenomenon in the universe that I can definitely call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axiomatic (that I am).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about this: &quot;I&quot; is that piece of me, as an entity, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences. I exclude all information processing components from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, although they are undoubtedly required to be present. I feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like there is something left over that can be termed &quot;I&quot; (and which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is somehow pivotal), but I also know that that can't be the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; There is no self separate from the rest of the universe.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; concept of self is a process that evolved within certain replicating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; patterns of the universe due to its utility to the survival and further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; propagation of those patterns.  The concept of &quot;self&quot; (everything inside)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and &quot;not self&quot; (everything outside) is fundamental to virtually all
</em><br>
complex
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; processes that promote survival and thus propagation of the organism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No wonder its so difficult to see.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, this material explanation of self makes a lot of sense, yet I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine a system which fully meets the description, and yet doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have this visceral, fundamental experience of being.
</em><br>
<p>Consider, from a systems programming point of view the following:
<br>
<p>(1) An organism that has environmental and internal sensors to produce
<br>
signals of *Sensation* which drive automatic responses to low level stimuli
<br>
(pain; food).
<br>
<p>(2) A higher level structural shell that combines with other running
<br>
processes to produce *Emotions* which drive actions in response to current
<br>
conditions in the environment (anger; sex, ...)
<br>
<p>(3) An even higher evolved layer to monitor and combine with current
<br>
knowledge and memories to produce *Feelings* which further serve the
<br>
survival and reproductive capability of the organism (extrapolating from the
<br>
past to anticipate future threats; language, and more advanced means of
<br>
sharing knowledge; ...)
<br>
<p>(4) At an even higher level, ...well, let's leave that for later.
<br>
<p>Within that more highly evolved layer of Feelings, wouldn't you expect that
<br>
the organism would Feel that is is conscious?  That would be the most direct
<br>
and natural way to arive at its evolutionarily adapted functionality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me, it is more clearly evident than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of anything else. But apparently it cannot be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Help.
