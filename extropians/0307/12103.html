<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think it is a feedback loop, thought defines language and in turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; language constrains thought, at least when you think with words. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think the effect is very strong when you compare similar languages. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spoke only one language (Italian) as a child, so most of the times I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think in that language. I know some other languages (English Spanish and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; French, all indo-european languages) well enough to think in them when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am speaking them, and I do not notice any significant difference.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that has to be our default assumption, (null hypothesis).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But I am sure that if I could speak Chinese well enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think in Chinese when speaking Chinese, I would notice significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; differences in my thought patterns. At least this is what fluent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speakers of two very different languages (e.g. a child whose two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mother languages are English and Chinese) say.
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps you should talk to more people, in the light of:

<p><em>&gt; I think it's through an availability mechanism;  I speak Arabic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English fluently, and certain thoughts or mechanisms are very difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;translate&quot; semantically (ergo there exists no corresponding word or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short phrase in the other language). In any event, I don't think that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language in and of itself necessarily limits thought development;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however it can delay it....  Sufficiently intelligent people come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with new words all the time in their day-to-day dealings [that map to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something significant missing from their current semantic set].....And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually it filters down to the masses.  Put another way, knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several languages expands ur ability to capture a thought precisely {and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus is highly recommended}; knowing one language does not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hinder that development of a thought, just delays it.  And that goes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically different languages (like English or Chinese), in that left to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own devices, the English and Chinese would eventually identify all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the notions they want...  The order in which a particular semantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion is discovered however, would probably be vastly different in such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremes.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds quite sensible.  I especially appreciate your observation that
<br>
one language can *delay* the conclusions that one could or would come
<br>
to, without preventing them.  Even that is quite a concession to the
<br>
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.  While of course it can be harder to convey
<br>
in one language what is easy in another, it surely is about equally
<br>
difficult or easy to *think* certain thoughts.  At least that's what
<br>
I am concluding from this discussion.
