</em><br>
<p>[Brett] You've got me pegged pretty right. But peoples 
<br>
*actions* are often less ambiguous than their words.
<br>
In the absence of a clear statement of intent I can deem
<br>
one to have been made on their behalf. 
<br>
<p>Me: You can always infer, but are your correct in ur inference?
<br>
While I am at quite at home giving the boot (nothing is
<br>
worse than a scratch u can't itch), I don't like giving
<br>
people the boot erroneously.  Practically speaking, that
<br>
means I give them the benefit of the doubt.
<br>
<p><p>You: Eg.  A drunk driver is no less dangerous for meaning
<br>
no harm and from me would probably get little mercy
<br>
despite quite a lot of understanding. 
<br>
<p>Me: in other words, u judge not only by intention, but
<br>
by effect :)  I do the same thing, but for a while
<br>
{17-23} it was an outstanding question in my mind;
<br>
or put another way, how hard{line} a game do u play? :)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;shrugs&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in essence (at least theoretically), I agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RL tends to be less direct.
</em><br>
<p>You:Sorry you lost me with RL?
<br>
<p>Me: Real Life (sm).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;... and the great fear that stops a lesser mind from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; becoming a greater mind is the fear of looking stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh I'd agree with that statement insofar as it is a limiting factor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for  attempting new directions;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Hell, more than that its a limiting factor in learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of us live lives surrounded by sources of good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and people who will as happily help us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and return one good turn for another as not. Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one builds up some credibility and a stock of skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contacts and a knowledge base to trade even the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade gets to be informal and people with win/win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitudes to mutual empowerment tend to seek 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Thats also limited though by ur access to such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, and what they have to offer in trade (versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are offering and their needs).
</em><br>
<p>You:As I've gotten older (I'm now 36) I've found that getting access to
<br>
what some 
<br>
would regard as influential people is often surprisingly easy. 
<br>
<p>Me: Depends on what u mean by influential :) Besides, I'm not
<br>
interested in meeting (necessarily) influential people; 
<br>
just brilliant (and focused) ones :)  [who may be influential] :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have run {acting as one of those people who is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skilled in several areas within my extended family}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into several roadblocks; the largest being the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in experience levels between my own level, and that of several cousins
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; and other associated ilk, despite being of similar chronological age.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The reality of the situation is that without a bloodline (regardless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time in shared common experiences), I would probably not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bothered, since they have nothing notable of trade. 
</em><br>
<p>You: Yep. I get what your saying. Sometimes perhaps for family
<br>
or perhaps because ones sees someone be generous to 
<br>
others or perhaps just because the simple humanity of the
<br>
other is enough to build a bridge between you - you give
<br>
them trade credit. Latter maybe they repay you.
<br>
<p>Me: ... or u may just be particularly bored :)  Generally
<br>
I'm free with information/expertise, insofar as the request
<br>
for that information is made in such a manner as to evince:
<br>
a) some effort to solve the problem (independance)
<br>
b) some [stalled] effort to analyze why their solution didn't work.
<br>
<p>Generally I don't like dealing with stupid [or lazy] people who
<br>
invariably
<br>
(despite their best efforts) suck up my time needlessly.  Or put
<br>
another way, people who aren't going to be able a) comprehend
<br>
the answer (or subtlities contained therein) or b)perform the
<br>
solution.  That cuts out alot of the traif :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most sophisticated of them required (practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking), approx 3 years to even begin to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an outlook that will eventually lead to a good set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offerings.
</em><br>
<p>You: I think everyone has something to trade, the exchanges
<br>
are not always equal ones, and when the other tries to 
<br>
bullshit you the trade should be terminated with extreme prejudice. 
<br>
And sometimes you just have to say sorry can't help today or this time.
<br>
<p>Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA :)
<br>
They wish I was that gentle :)
<br>
<p>Generally I'm pretty much the last resort :) :)
<br>
I'll fix their problem, but they'll get a running lecture
<br>
the size of NY pointing out all the flaws in their current
<br>
mode of thinking :)  The particularly intelligent ones shut
<br>
up and listen; the stupid ones invariably attempt to offer
<br>
&lt;insert stupid excuse&gt;, ergo in one ear, out the other.
<br>
Those I don't bother dealing with anymore.
<br>
<p>As to everything having something to trade, well, yes :) 
<br>
Thats why the invented the term cannon fodder :P 
<br>
&lt;ok, just kidding&gt;.  I can't say that for me personally, 
<br>
everybody has something to trade.... But i suppose
<br>
thats more of a failure on my part to be interested
<br>
in everyday things that seems to consume a majority
<br>
of their lives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The fear of *looking* stupid might very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cost people their lives in coming decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ignorance and stupidity are not the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; We all start ignorant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd like to think we all remain ignorant [given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sheer volume of  information and possibilities];
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some of us just manage to migrate to (slightly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lesser degrees of ignorance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I see in this what I consider to be a socrates fallacy, ie,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the notion that as nothing can really be known the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who thinks they know nothing is actually wisest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh I wouldn't go so far;  I am merely pointing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to pin down any particular statement as a fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you generally have to limit the domain in which u are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing; and that given true mastery of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment {which is at least, my goal} cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had given the limitation just expressed, ergo we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never be able to completely remove from ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a state of ignorance {given the expansion of the domain}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or as David Bowie said in one of his songs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that @ a certain point in development {of say, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology), I don't prefer knowledge, just certainty :)
</em><br>
<p>You: Seems I misunderstood you. Sorry. Am I right to infer
<br>
that you'd agree that even within even a complex 
<br>
domain where certainty is not possible that you'd
<br>
still prefer and persue means to reduce the extent
<br>
of the uncertainty, to reduce your ignorance as much
<br>
as possible. I could be off on a tangent here.
<br>
<p>Me: Certes :) You are correct;  I would add only one qualification...
<br>
That I do not pursue all available portions of knowledge....
<br>
I follow a demand-based algorithm for acquisition of expertise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are social to an extent, (it is not sensible or useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or healthy for us to personally doubt this), we are reasonable to an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent ( again let socrates or the neo-socratics take a shot at that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a fallacy). Once we know we are social and we are ration[al] we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know some things that are useful to us, to our happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and our development. We learn that we have freedoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that we remain free within bounds. We cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violate the contingent nature of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but that leaves in a continual state of ignorance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does it not?  There *is* no final point of enlightment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where we mystically shed our ignorance and reach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an enlightended state :)
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
Ignorance about some things yes. But not ignorance
<br>
all things. 
<br>
<p>Me: if you're ignorant of something, and knowledgeable
<br>
about everything else, you're still ignorant :)  You may
<br>
be more knowledgeable (in comparison) to someone
<br>
else, but ur still ignorant :) Its ok to be ignorant of
<br>
something; it is not ok to stay ignorant because you
<br>
love to be ignorant :) Ergo the Black People vs Niggas
<br>
speech by chris rock :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ergo my previous statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of simply being able to reach lesser degrees of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance.
</em><br>
<p>You: Wow. Perhaps we have come in a circle or were at
<br>
cross purposes because now I am agreeing with you.
<br>
Ignorance is a matter of degree. (But there are some certainties). 
<br>
<p>I wonder if you are agreeing with me that there are some 
<br>
elemental truths (some certainties) more fundamental than 
<br>
science and less social than proof of which we are not 
<br>
ignorant. Indeed they form the foundation of what we 
<br>
build on top of them. Or rather we build outward from
<br>
our subjective centre.
<br>
<p>Me:  I dunno, I have it cast in a different image;
<br>
I think there is an objective reality, and that knowledge
<br>
of it can be obtained;  I also hold there is a notion of
<br>
subjective objectivity, insofar as they are truths contained
<br>
in my (or your) particular pecerptual filters, as well as
<br>
the effects (artifacts) of our perceptual distortions.
<br>
<p>Generally I would say yes, at the beginning, u build out
<br>
from ur subjectively perceived notions of realities...
<br>
But I think u can fundamentally characterize both
<br>
truths as they relate to your subjective viewpoints,
<br>
and by removing those truths (or inversing the function),
<br>
achieve the objective reality that stimulates ur perceptions.
<br>
And thats not even considering the cases of intuition, and
<br>
abstract reasoning systems :) Which are seperate cases.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point, ignorance is a natural starting postion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not something to be *ashamed* of, but nor is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in itself a positive virtue. Socrates was wrong. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisest man is not the man who knows he knows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing. Imo :-)  A wiser man knows that he is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational and social and that he will find health and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfaction and good relations at least potentially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with other men (or women) if he proceeds on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis of these truths that present themselves to him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a level even  more fundamental than  scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truths. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't go so far as to agree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding ur point on Socrates;  I think we simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differ in our intrepratations :)  You seem to imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socrates was saying ignorance is a blessed state;
</em><br>
<p>You: That was not my intent. I think Socrates was trying
<br>
to disclose hypocrosy and false knowledge and his 
<br>
method works well to a point. But it works in dialectic.
<br>
The monologue of the subjective and some truths
<br>
are untouchable by Socrates. 
<br>
<p>Me: Aaaah I see what u're getting at.  You're saying
<br>
without a comparison to judge your ignorance against,
<br>
a mans natural inclination should (or would) be to attempt to 
<br>
understand his own nature....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; whereas I think that Socrates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was stating a simple truth; that no matter how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge you accumulate, there is still so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more to learn, and past that, too many probabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deal with.  He wasn't explicitly giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison function; merely observing that anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with half a brain will also have hit a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.... which of course, implies a test of sorts.... Of course,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; the game can get deeper from there :)
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
I am I think only partly getting your meaning now.
<br>
<p>Let me try another take. 1 and 1 make 2. This is 
<br>
a truth open to any inquiring rational mind. The 
<br>
words may be changed but the referents don't.
<br>
<p>A person may not be a mathematical genius but
<br>
still be sure that one and one make two. The rest
<br>
of the mathematical domain can be built on top
<br>
of that (not by all of us and not completely) so to
<br>
some extent all of remain ignorant of mathematics
<br>
if we make ignorance or non ignorance of all
<br>
mathematics the issue. If we have to answer truthfully
<br>
to ourselves do I understand all mathematics yes or 
<br>
no or am I ignorant of the domain as an entirety (but
<br>
not elements of it) them yes, one can be ignorant.
<br>
<p>Me: bing :)  The only time you can consider urself
<br>
non-ignorant is by limiting the domain u are considering
<br>
and knowing everything about it :)  You can also
<br>
do comparisons between states of ignorance within
<br>
the context of a particular evaluation function :)
<br>
<p>You: But in practical terms we take on the subject matter
<br>
in complex domains in increments. We model reality
<br>
we don't perceive the whole shebang in one hit. One
<br>
can reduce ones ignorance of the whole shebang
<br>
by degrees. But not remove ignorance of all entirely.
<br>
<p>Me: Reductionism may not necessarily give you the
<br>
entire picture, IMHO.  Consider that the symbols
<br>
you are using to identify semantic notions are defined
<br>
by their very relationship to each other...  In that sense
<br>
your vocabulary is defined holistically.  Whether or
<br>
not ur semantics can be encapsulated by examining each
<br>
separate relationship between each of the concepts
<br>
is not gauranteed.  The tapestry may be more complicated
<br>
than that (and probably is).  I do agree that more insight
<br>
can (statistically speaking) usually be derived, but
<br>
fundamentally I think it will require a holistic viewpoint
<br>
to gel it all together.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  and BTW - just because you achieve a lesser state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ignorance does not mean u neccesarily are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competent that someone else in the grand scheme of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things; I, for instance, though quite skilled in several areas, would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not care to go head to head with a peasant in the area concerning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing things.
</em><br>
<p>You: True. There are different domains of knowledge that each
<br>
or us can pursue. But importantly imo there are some 
<br>
domains of knowledge that all of us MUST persue or 
<br>
be in a state of bad faith with ourselves. 
<br>
<p>Me: Well :) That would depend entirely on the utility
<br>
you derive from lacking that PARTICULAR piece of 
<br>
ignorance :)  Now outside forces, can intrude upon
<br>
you and mess with ur utility functions, but only
<br>
insofar as you value the benefits they offer.
<br>
Thats the link between perception and expectation
<br>
btw :)
<br>
<p>You: And this is that we must each perceive the world 
<br>
from the centre of  a subjective universe and that we start doing so
<br>
with 
<br>
a propensity for sociability and a capacity for rationality
<br>
and these two together gives us language which enable
<br>
us to approach to varing degrees the subjective 
<br>
universe of the other.
<br>
<p>Me: Yes but what if you have no sense of self?  You're left with a case
<br>
where there is no impetus :) a very real case for human beings :)
<br>
Just go ask all the lobotomized people :) or the schizophrenics and
<br>
the like...  You're trying to extrapolate ur viewpoint out to encompass
<br>
all human beings;  I'm saying that more important than all of that is
<br>
the utility derived from going from a state of ignorance to a state of
<br>
{less} ignorance... If there is no utility, then there is no difference.
<br>
This is btw, the main reason why I (practically-speaking), feel 
<br>
completely at home ignoring entire bodies of work; there is no utility
<br>
:)
<br>
Just because the information is present doesn't mean there is some
<br>
inherent
<br>
burning need to go out and consume it :)  You're arguing ur points of
<br>
the notion that the capacity for reason and the propensity for
<br>
socialability
<br>
are two givens; I would disagree, in that the capacity for reason may be
<br>
deficient (or absent), and the same for socialability....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge is not an instant path to success :) The fitness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ur function depends heavily on the environment in which you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing.
</em><br>
<p>You: Agreed. A nuclear physicist that can't swim across out
<br>
of a river when his boat sinks has in a way wasted some
<br>
of his time learning excess knowledge in one domain and
<br>
not enough in another - swimming.
<br>
<p>But I come back to my central point. All of have some 
<br>
domains in common. We all start from the subjective 
<br>
centre, we all are social, we all are rational, and 
<br>
we all value our lives. Our lives are the first value to us. 
<br>
<p>Me: See, in this starting assumption (social, rational, value of life)
<br>
we differ :)  Although a majority of people may ostensibly have
<br>
those qualities in some degree, not everyone does :) Now if you
<br>
would like to limit ur statements to the subset of people who do
<br>
have those qualities.... :) 
<br>
<p>You: And perhaps we can use these universals in domain
<br>
to good effect. Perhaps we can ground a more rational
<br>
ethics. But I digress as well as rant :-)
<br>
<p>Me: I think u will be dissappointed; the utilities (short of forced
<br>
death) 
<br>
are not there.  But even death is not enough it seems 
<br>
[given the vast amount of people that have come before us and died]....
<br>
And as u said earlier, the limiting factor is often a fear of appearing 
<br>
stupid or foolish.
