Interesting observations indeed, Robert...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faster-changing forms of genes, including those you mention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just to offer some related observations...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - People would be very lucky to have 20 kids -- most humans throughout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary history died long before they could have raised 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that number.
</em><br>
<p>But today you could. For instance, how many kids could Bill Gates have if he
<br>
decided to maximise reproduction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Given the huge amount of junk DNA in mammalian genomes (and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success of mammals over the last 60+ million years) and the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the junk is mostly remnants of self-relocating genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elements that would happen to carry other genes along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them (speeding up evolution) it would appear that there may be some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selective advantage for faster evolution.  We can't say for sure about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this since we don't have the genomes of say birds, reptiles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or amphibians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which have been around longer than mammals and have similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - *But* given the Fugu genome which is very old and relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small compared with mammals (it is a vertebrate so the complexity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not be &quot;too&quot; different) it would appear evolution can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop a means to interfere with the elements that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally tend speed up evolution (how this is accomplished isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known at this time).
</em><br>
<p>Ok, natural selection in humans might be able to be sped up. But compare and
<br>
contrast memes to genes, over say the last 5000 years (7000 years??). In
<br>
terms of memes, we've gone from the first civilisations to the global system
<br>
we have today, replete with mind-boggling technologies and vastly (!)
<br>
altered lifestyles. Compare this to evolutionary changes to humans... we've
<br>
become a bit taller.
<br>
<p>You just need to look at how incredibly strongly we have outcompeted the
<br>
rest of the mammals, to see that general intelligence has been a superbly
<br>
powerful discontinuity; culture kicks the butt of DNA...
<br>
<p>.. in mammals and the higher lifeforms. OTOH, DNA in insects and bacteria
<br>
seems to be doing a pretty fine job of keeping up with us. Very short
<br>
generation time is necessary, though.
<br>
<p>So for genes to compete with memes, it seems that they need to be organised
<br>
very differently from our own. Ours now is a basically static blueprint for
<br>
the hardware, at least until we get full control over it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - There has been proposed some interesting secondary effects in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution involved in nurturing (or promoting the survival of)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offspring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030717091254.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030717091254.htm</a>].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similar effects may be promoting the development of &quot;ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I think these exist, but they now promote the welfare of the entire group -
<br>
sometimes nations, or humanity itself. eg: look at our own philosophies...
<br>
where is the benefit for our personal DNA in that? And these secondary
<br>
effects must benefit the memes far more strongly, both immediately and long
<br>
term, than genes. As far as I can see, human DNA is mostly doing a random
<br>
walk around a basically flat fitness plateau.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Language (memes) seems to have played a role in speeding up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human evolution over the last 100,000+ years.  But one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder whether memes and genes are not competing to see which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can drive evolution faster without completely driving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carriers towards elimination.
</em><br>
<p>Like a snail racing a ramship... no contest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - At the simple chemical level DNA is not a terribly bad information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storage mechanism (compared with say a Drexlerian polymer tape,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g. Nanosystems sec. 12.6.4).  But I suspect that there may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some interesting limits on the equipment that allows an ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster changing of genes/memes.  So the process seems unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to continue indefinitely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert
</em><br>
<p>Mostly because we'll subvert it entirely to our own ends well before it gets
<br>
to do anything else interesting.
<br>
<p>I'm a bit surprised that you thing there is anything left in human genetic
<br>
evolution, Robert. Aren't you the same Rob Bradbury who says we shouldn't
<br>
bother colonising Mars, because we'll have dissassembled it remotely before
<br>
we can get there? Think of the timescales here. That human genes can evolve
<br>
is true, but its like saying that glass can flow at room temperature;
<br>
absolutely true, but pretty much irrelevant.
