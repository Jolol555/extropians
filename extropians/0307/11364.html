</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;junk dna&quot; gained currency, I've wondered why someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hasn't challenged the notion. [snip]
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I have to be a wet blanket on this one.
<br>
At least 50%, and perhaps as much as 95%, of the human genome
<br>
(probably most mammalian genomes) really is indeed &quot;junk&quot; [1,2].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can it really be said--having barely embarked on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journey of discovery-- that we know enough about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function of dna to declare the apparent 'excess' to be junk.
</em><br>
<p>Much of it is &quot;junk&quot; from a currently useful genome standpoint.
<br>
It is not however &quot;junk&quot; from an evolutionary (&amp; selfish gene)
<br>
standpoint.  That is because much of it consists of interspersed
<br>
repeats, especially LINEs, SINEs, LTRs, etc. (see pgs 879-888 of
<br>
[2] for a very good explanation with nice statistics).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nature 'believes' in efficiency.  Fitness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency go hand in hand.  It took an awful lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy to make all that 'junk'.
</em><br>
<p>This is too simplistic Jeff.  Efficiency can be measured in
<br>
many ways.  In mammalian genomes it seems to be measured
<br>
by selfish genetic elements in a way something along the
<br>
lines of &quot;how fast can I copy genes to increase the pace
<br>
of evolution&quot;.  In Fugu (pufferfish) genomes it seems to
<br>
be measured in a way along the lines of &quot;how much junk
<br>
can I remove from the genome without destroying functions
<br>
critical to the survival of the species&quot;.
<br>
<p>That is why Fugu can produce a vertebrate with ~430Kbases
<br>
of DNA while it requires most mammals almost an order
<br>
of magnitude more to accomplish the same task.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The utility of the 'extra' dna awaits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the gradual elaboration of the grand scheme.
</em><br>
<p>Probably not.  The only &quot;utility&quot; speculations I've seen
<br>
this far may be in helping to align similar chromosomes during
<br>
meiosis, mitosis and homologous recombination DNA repair.
<br>
But this has a down-side -- the similarity between many
<br>
of the transposable elements (interspersed repeats) allows
<br>
these processes to become confused (thinking two regions
<br>
of a chromosome pair are the &quot;same&quot; region when they really
<br>
are not).  This can produce insertions and deltions in
<br>
chromosomes leading to diseases like DiGeorge and
<br>
Williams-Beuren syndromes [2, pgs 911-912].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've heard tell that for birds, evolution winnowed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cargo of dna, the better for the birdies to get and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stay airborne.  Or so the theory goes.  If indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution trimmed their dna, then we have a proof of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle re dna trimming for fitness purposes.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profligate and wasteful production of 'junk' dna
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarly seems an idea too heavily freighted to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the ground.
</em><br>
<p>I once thought this as well (may have even said so on the
<br>
list sometime) but Robert Freitas has argued fairly
<br>
convincingly to me that the mass of the DNA is negligible
<br>
relative to the mass of the cell itself so there is
<br>
unlikely to be significant selective pressure to
<br>
reduce the quantity of DNA in animals that fly.
<br>
<p>There doesn't seem to be much selective pressure at all
<br>
on carrying around (and having to replicate) what is
<br>
probably lots of 'junk' DNA -- if there were then the
<br>
Amoeba dubia wouldn't have 700 pg of DNA (~200x the
<br>
human amount for a genome size of ~670 billion bases) [4,5].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some time ago, when I first got annoyed at the seeming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumptuousness of the 'junk' dna concept, I wondered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if perhaps the 'junk' might be preferentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distributed in the outer layers of the nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; package, providing a 'shield' for the really vital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'inner' bits.  You know.  Whatever nasty dna-degrading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agencies--free radicals, mutagenic compounds, ionizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiation--runnin' around loose in the cytosol, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to get past the protective/sacrificial outer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; layers before thay could do any 'real' damage.  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an idea.
</em><br>
<p>Though it isn't distributed as you descibe, the concept
<br>
does have some merit -- free radical damage, double strand
<br>
breaks, etc. are likely to be much less harmful if they
<br>
take place in the &quot;junk&quot; rather than in the &quot;useful&quot; DNA.
<br>
Since most, if not all, of this type of damage impacts
<br>
DNA randomly retaining random &quot;junk&quot; may have a slight
<br>
benefit for personal and species genome stability.  But
<br>
this isn't a very strong argument -- mice and humans
<br>
have a 30-50x difference in longevity and yet the amount
<br>
of &quot;junk&quot; in their genomes is similar (mice have only a
<br>
slightly smaller genome than the 3+ gigabase human genome).
