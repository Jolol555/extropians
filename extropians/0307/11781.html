<em>&gt; I am not sure myself though that the overhyping is always as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much as a problem as it is held to be. I guess it depends on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In which *particular* respects do you think hyped statements 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Zey's may be more harmful than helpful?
</em><br>
<p>Well, since we're already discussing aging in another thread, I think
<br>
this is a perfect example.
<br>
<p>Why did several very good researchers on aging sign onto the position
<br>
paper in SciAm?  Because for every person making statements about the
<br>
future of human longevity that are grounded in some sort of plausible
<br>
scientific comprehension of the field, there are hundreds who are
<br>
talking nonsense.  Many of those talking nonsense are making money
<br>
from it.
<br>
<p>This drives reasonable scientists in the field nuts, and incents them
<br>
to put as much distance between themselves and the &quot;kooks&quot; who are
<br>
talking about radical life extension as possible.  This happens to the
<br>
extent that reasonable scientists substantially understate their true
<br>
expectations of the field, for fear of being tarred with the &quot;kook&quot;
<br>
brush.
<br>
<p>If Zey had gotten up and pointed to the current research that supports
<br>
the idea that the rate of aging in humans can be tweaked, I'd feel
<br>
differently and more positively towards his talk.  If he had done this
<br>
AND had also provided the various caveats and counter-arguments
<br>
against current evidence, I'd be downright impressed.  But when,
<br>
instead, someone makes predictions of &quot;immortality&quot; based on highly
<br>
improbable evidence or a poor understanding of current research, it
<br>
just hurts the credibility of the people more seriously working
<br>
towards or analyzing the possibility of substantial lengthening of
<br>
human life.
