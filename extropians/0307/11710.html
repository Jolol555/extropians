<p>Me too. On both counts.
<br>
<p>Better to do something given willing volunteers (I note Dan put his
<br>
hand up) and a prototype and improve it (if necessary later) than
<br>
not. 
<br>
<p>But there is a need, I think, with any well intentioned proposal,
<br>
to acknowledge that ExI is a brand and like any brand can be 
<br>
weakened as well as strengthened through poorly executed
<br>
well intentioned schemes. The upshot of this is that, I think, it is
<br>
important that the Exi Board (or those charged with taking the
<br>
wider view on protect the ExI brand) have a procedure for
<br>
considering and feeding back responses on ideas that are put
<br>
forward. 
<br>
<p>I think its also important to realise that extropic, transhuman, 
<br>
humanistic, etc goals can and probably should (for maximum 
<br>
effect) be pursued under more than one brand. I've seen merit
<br>
in a number of ideas put forward by folks on this list, such as
<br>
Mike Lorrey, Reason, Jef Allbright, and the list is a good place
<br>
to find others willing to support good thrusts but not
<br>
*everything* needs to be done beneath one banner even the
<br>
ExI banner.
