1. I find implausible how the system is supposed to get rolling in the first
<br>
place--the signaling system seems too weak. Of course, a strong signal
<br>
system is introduced later on with the &quot;moral vision system&quot;, however, it is
<br>
difficult to see how this system could realistically get going without such
<br>
a strong system earlier on. The trouble of course is how to signal that one
<br>
has made an ethical investment. It is true that sometimes some entities get
<br>
called on the carpet, e.g., a teachers' pension fund might get criticized
<br>
for investing in something less than ethical, the trouble is how to assess
<br>
see the signals of those whose financial dealings are not open to public
<br>
scrutiny. It is the usual problem with defectors: one can wear a pin and
<br>
look like one is investing with the ethical while in fact actually investing
<br>
with the merely &quot;prudent&quot; (Of course the prudent may invest the way that the
<br>
ethical do on occasion, the prudent have the &quot;advantage&quot; that they need
<br>
not). For example, notice how the story talks says that  &quot;the major
<br>
Protestant churches in the U.S. instructed their congregations to bring
<br>
their investments into line with their consciences.&quot; Well, if it were that
<br>
easy you would think they could stop any number of sins, e.g., it would seem
<br>
a simple matter to stop adultery by simply exhorting everyone not to covet
<br>
thy neighbor's wife, etc. The story of course could be altered to
<br>
accommodate this point. Perhaps the ethical wave doesn't get rolling until
<br>
the advent of &quot;moral vision system&quot;. Another less hi-tech possibility is
<br>
that the amount one invests in ethical funds allows one to earn one of the
<br>
angelic titles in the traditional hierarchy:
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;a.. Seraphim
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b.. Cherubim
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;c.. Thrones
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;d.. Dominions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;e.. Powers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;f.. Authorities
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;g.. Principalities
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;h.. Archangels
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;i.. Angels
<br>
So the greater your investment (as a proportion of your disposable income)
<br>
into ethical funds the higher your angelic title. If I'm as invested as I
<br>
can be in ethical funds then I might earn the title &quot;Seraphim Mark Walker&quot;.
<br>
What's to stop everyone calling themselves a 'Seraphim', well, my income and
<br>
investments could be monitored by an independent agency and the results
<br>
published on the web. There would be no need to publish my earnings or
<br>
holdings, only the percentage of my disposable income invested in ethical
<br>
funds, (which would be expressed by my angelic designation).
<br>
<p>2. Of course one can't help but worry that this sort of &quot;fad&quot; really has to
<br>
fight an uphill battle against human (biological) nature in a way that the
<br>
consumerism of the bourgeoisie never had to. I'm reminded of the way that
<br>
the &quot;straight edge&quot; movement in punk has seemed to have pit itself against
<br>
human nature in a way that &quot;true&quot; punks never have. So, as optimistic as
<br>
this story is, I guess I'm still inclined to think that the ends of ethics
<br>
will not be realized until we remake our biological selves into more ethical
<br>
beings.
<br>
