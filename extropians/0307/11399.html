<em>&gt; &gt; In general it seems that the speed of gravity disturbances is very close 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the speed of light. It might be interesting to imagine a universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where this was not true. What about a world where gravity was as slow as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the speed of sound?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you clarify what you imagine this world would be like. To me I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really see that the propogation speed would make any observable difference as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective force levels would still be the same in any region.
</em><br>
<p>For a static field in such a &quot;slow gravity&quot; universe nothing would
<br>
change. But imagine sending out Voyager towards Jupiter. At first it
<br>
experiences the weak tug towards the place where Jupiter was a long time
<br>
ago, and is accelerated that way. As it approaches the region where
<br>
Jupiter is, the acceleration will change direction and move towards the
<br>
current position, and as Voyager continues beyond it will shift back
<br>
towards an old position.
<br>
<p>Even worse, Jupiter is actually moving &quot;supersonically&quot; in this setting! 
<br>
If Voyager is approaching from straight ahead of the planet it will not
<br>
experience any gravitational field since Jupiter is moving faster than
<br>
the information about where it is is spreading through the gravity
<br>
field. So on one side of Jupiter you would actually be weightless! On
<br>
the other side all the information is present and you get normal
<br>
gravity. And you get a discontinous bow shock where you go from no
<br>
gravity to a mix of several accelerations pointing towards many former
<br>
positions (likely just causing an inward accleration into the shock
<br>
cone).
<br>
<p>A universe with this kind of enormously slow gravity would be very
<br>
different. Gravitational radiation would be intense, likely making all
<br>
orbits unstable - everything would spiral together. Jupiter would slow
<br>
down even more simply by ejecting matter ahead of its motion (since the
<br>
atmosphere on the front side would not &quot;know&quot; that there was a planet
<br>
beneath). Gravity shockwaves would crisscross the universe, acting as
<br>
great navigational hazards. 
<br>
<p>Hmm, sounds almost like the typical pulp sf world.
