<p>Actually, current geological thought says that its worse, but also better 
<br>
than that.  When a reduction in atmospheric CO2 progresses far enough, the 
<br>
polar caps grow, and the increased albedo from them further cools the Earth 
<br>
in a runaway process that ends with our planet becoming one big 
<br>
snowball.  This seems to have happened several times in the distant past, 
<br>
put with massive death among photosynthesizers, the CO2 released from 
<br>
volcanos (that's where inducted carbon eventually ends up) built up enough 
<br>
to reverse the process.  Luckily, the increased light from an expanding sun 
<br>
(or the emergence of Gaia take your pick) seems to have prevented this from 
<br>
happening in &quot;recent&quot; geological history.
