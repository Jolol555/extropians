<em>&gt; &gt;Since NASA was previously approved to have a 1000-man permanent colony on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the moon in the 1970's, I don't see how the above prediction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradicts my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;position. [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are of course correct. A curious question: what plans did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NASA have for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 1000-man colony? What would they do on the moon? What was the motive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for sending a 1000 people on a high risk voyage to what's basically a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rock?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know a lot of details.  Google could find few details.  Here are a
<br>
few proposals, but I don't know which one would match what I remember.
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.astronautix.com/craft/aporbase.htm">http://www.astronautix.com/craft/aporbase.htm</a>&gt; shows what was already
<br>
approved and budgeted by NASA as part of the Apollo program, which was later
<br>
cancelled.
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.astronautix.com/craft/proelena.htm">http://www.astronautix.com/craft/proelena.htm</a>&gt; shows project Selena which
<br>
was an alternative to Apollo and focused on expanding the moon habitat
<br>
modules.
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.astronautix.com/articles/propter1.htm">http://www.astronautix.com/articles/propter1.htm</a>&gt; shows a 1959 Army report
<br>
that focused on the military significance of having a moon base before the
<br>
Russians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 120 years has been the approximated maximum life span for (biologically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unmodified) humans for a long time, AFAIK much longer than the 80s. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _actual_ average life span however is still steadily increasing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people, their personal predictions have increased.
</em><br>
<p>Is anybody seriously thinking they have achieved a 120+ year lifespan with
<br>
today's technology?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Conclusion: time will be on our side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Perhaps in the future, but it has not been so in the past decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or two of life-extension therapies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wasn't it the future we were talking about?
</em><br>
<p>No.  I was talking about history.  The life expectancy of life-extensionists
<br>
has shrunk in recent decades.  In the 1980's life extensionists believed
<br>
that their current diet would let them live to 120 years and beyond.  They
<br>
no longer believe that.  As these individuals gained more knowledge, they
<br>
have scaled back their life-expectancy numbers.
<br>
<p>My observations are not about the future.  My observations was that
<br>
currently known capabilities are less than &quot;currently known&quot; capability in
<br>
previous decades.  Some abilities (like space travel) have been lost.  Some
<br>
abilities (like life extension and cryonics) have been revised.  Some
<br>
abilities (like AI and robotics) have been corrected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;AI research has never been limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by processing power.  It is not like folding@home where we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what to do but can't get enough cpu power.  AI programs simply don't work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are 2 dimensions to any software program:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. How much computation per time unit does it have available?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. What does it do with the computation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, it's very much a speed issue. For example, you say a &quot;very slow&quot; AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program would be fine. Ok, then lets call the speed at which this program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make the Turing test h. &quot;Very slow&quot; can't just mean half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the speed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; h or even a tenth of the speed of h, because if it did Moore's law would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fill the gap in a couple of years. No, &quot;very slow&quot; must mean at the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a million times slower than h (about 20 years of CPU-development with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moore's law). Something that would take the h-program 1 second to figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out would take this AI program 12 days. Most people wouldn't call that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious program.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But my point is that we cannot make this slow AI that you describe.
<br>
It is not available but too slow to be useful.  It does not exist, because
<br>
we can't make it work.  If we could make that slow one work, we could easily
<br>
build faster hardware, run parallel processes, and all sorts of other
<br>
techniques.  But it doesn't exist.  We don't know how to build it.  All
<br>
previous attempts have failed.  Moore's law won't make it work.  We have to
<br>
redesign something fundamentally new to get this to work.  People who keep
<br>
quoting Moore's law don't understand that.  In fact, most computer designers
<br>
that I know hate Moore's law, because it is almost always wrong and used
<br>
incorrectly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;People who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.  And I am afraid that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this is exactly what is happening.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe. What do you think must be done to avoid this?
</em><br>
<p>Stop quoting slogans and propaganda, do some technological reading, and
<br>
learn the real history and current state of technology.  That's what I think
<br>
should be done.
