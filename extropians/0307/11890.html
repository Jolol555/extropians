<em>&gt; &gt; I think I am a perhaps a bit like Harvey in that I

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Me:

<em>&gt; Agreed :) Thats generally how I play it ;P

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hahahahaha :) I doubt things are resolved to ur 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfaction on a regular basis, insofar as people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would feel the need to reach for the &quot;ambiguity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the middle ground&quot; are rarely capable (emotionally)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to offer such a clear statement of  intent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or perhaps I'm coloring I'm simply painting it through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lense of my  experiences.
</em><br>
<p>[Brett] You've got me pegged pretty right. But peoples 
<br>
*actions* are often less ambiguous than their words.
<br>
In the absence of a clear statement of intent I can deem
<br>
one to have been made on their behalf. 
<br>
<p>Eg.  A drunk driver is no less dangerous for meaning
<br>
no harm and from me would probably get little mercy
<br>
despite quite a lot of understanding. I'd understand that
<br>
with a reduce capacity to think clearly they drove
<br>
worse and dangerously but I'd also read into the
<br>
action that they were not drunk when they decided
<br>
to drink and their culpability and my validation for regarding
<br>
them with extreme prejudice follows from their earlier 
<br>
decision. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;shrugs&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in essence (at least theoretically), I agree. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RL tends to be less direct.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry you lost me with RL?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;... and the great fear that stops a lesser mind from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; becoming a greater mind is the fear of looking stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh I'd agree with that statement insofar as it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limiting factor for  attempting new directions;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Hell, more than that its a limiting factor in learning. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of us live lives surrounded by sources of good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and people who will as happily help us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and return one good turn for another as not. Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one builds up some credibility and a stock of skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contacts and a knowledge base to trade even the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade gets to be informal and people with win/win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitudes to mutual empowerment tend to seek 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Thats also limited though by ur access to such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, and what they have to offer in trade (versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are offering and their needs). 
</em><br>
<p>As I've gotten older (I'm now 36) I've found that getting
<br>
access to what some would regard as influential people
<br>
is often surprisingly easy. But then I rarely approach
<br>
them without a good reason and I'm not likely to be
<br>
after their autograph.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have run {acting as one of those people who is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skilled in several areas within my extended family}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into several roadblocks; the largest being the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in experience levels between my own level, and that of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several cousins and other associated ilk, despite being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of similar chronological age.  The reality of the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that without a bloodline (regardless of time in shared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common experiences), I would probably not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bothered, since they have nothing notable of trade. 
</em><br>
<p>Yep. I get what your saying. Sometimes perhaps for family
<br>
or perhaps because ones sees someone be generous to 
<br>
others or perhaps just because the simple humanity of the
<br>
other is enough to build a bridge between you - you give
<br>
them trade credit. Latter maybe they repay you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most sophisticated of them required (practically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking), approx 3 years to even begin to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an outlook that will eventually lead to a good set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offerings.
</em><br>
<p>I think everyone has something to trade, the exchanges
<br>
are not always equal ones, and when the other tries to 
<br>
bullshit you the trade should be terminated with extreme
<br>
prejudice. And sometimes you just have to say sorry
<br>
can't help today or this time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The fear of *looking* stupid might very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cost people their lives in coming decades. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ignorance and stupidity are not the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; We all start ignorant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd like to think we all remain ignorant [given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sheer volume of  information and possibilities];
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some of us just manage to migrate to (slightly) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lesser degrees of ignorance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I see in this what I consider to be a socrates fallacy, ie, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the notion that as nothing can really be known the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who thinks they know nothing is actually wisest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh I wouldn't go so far;  I am merely pointing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to pin down any particular statement as a fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you generally have to limit the domain in which u are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing; and that given true mastery of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment {which is at least, my goal} cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had given the limitation just expressed, ergo we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never be able to completely remove from ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a state of ignorance {given the expansion of the domain}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or as David Bowie said in one of his songs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that @ a certain point in development {of say, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology), I don't prefer knowledge, just certainty :)
</em><br>
<p>Seems I misunderstood you. Sorry. Am I right to infer
<br>
that you'd agree that even within even a complex 
<br>
domain where certainty is not possible that you'd
<br>
still prefer and persue means to reduce the extent
<br>
of the uncertainty, to reduce your ignorance as much
<br>
as possible. I could be off on a tangent here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are social to an extent, (it is not sensible or useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or healthy for us to personally doubt this), we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable to an extent ( again let socrates or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neo-socratics take a shot at that as a fallacy). Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we know we are social and we are ration[al] we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some things that are useful to us, to our happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and our development. We learn that we have freedoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that we remain free within bounds. We cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violate the contingent nature of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but that leaves in a continual state of ignorance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does it not?  There *is* no final point of enlightment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where we mystically shed our ignorance and reach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an enlightended state :)  
</em><br>
<p>Ignorance about some things yes. But not ignorance
<br>
all things. The subjective individual sits in the centre
<br>
of their own universe and reaches outward with their
<br>
mind for patterns to integrate or learn. The subjective
<br>
centre is solid. There is no basis for ignoring or being
<br>
ignorant that we each construct our own worldviews
<br>
from a subjective centre. And this subjective centre 
<br>
is *above* and outside scientific truth. Reason, 
<br>
science, language, proof these are words to us that
<br>
only make sense to us because others like us have 
<br>
taught us their meaning. But our capacity to reason
<br>
our propensity to be social these are the birthright of
<br>
the &quot;self&quot; these we can take as certainties even without
<br>
using the words. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ergo my previous statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of simply being able to reach lesser degrees of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance.
</em><br>
<p>Wow. Perhaps we have come in a circle or were at
<br>
cross purposes because now I am agreeing with you.
<br>
Ignorance is a matter of degree. (But there are some
<br>
certainties). 
<br>
<p>I wonder if you are agreeing with me that there are some
<br>
elemental truths (some certainties) more fundamental than
<br>
science and less social than proof of which we are not 
<br>
ignorant. Indeed they form the foundation of what we 
<br>
build on top of them. Or rather we build outward from
<br>
our subjective centre.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point, ignorance is a natural starting postion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not something to be *ashamed* of, but nor is it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in itself a positive virtue. Socrates was wrong. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisest man is not the man who knows he knows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing. Imo :-)  A wiser man knows that he is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational and social and that he will find health and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfaction and good relations at least potentially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with other men (or women) if he proceeds on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis of these truths that present themselves to him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a level even  more fundamental than  scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truths. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't go so far as to agree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding ur point on Socrates;  I think we simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differ in our intrepratations :)  You seem to imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socrates was saying ignorance is a blessed state;
</em><br>
<p>That was not my intent. I think Socrates was trying
<br>
to disclose hypocrosy and false knowledge and his 
<br>
method works well to a point. But it works in dialectic.
<br>
The monologue of the subjective and some truths
<br>
are untouchable by Socrates. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; whereas I think that Socrates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was stating a simple truth; that no matter how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge you accumulate, there is still so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more to learn, and past that, too many probabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deal with.  He wasn't explicitly giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison function; merely observing that anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with half a brain will also have hit a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.... which of course, implies a test of sorts....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, the game can get deeper from there :)
</em><br>
<p>I am I think only partly getting your meaning now.
<br>
<p>Let me try another take. 1 and 1 make 2. This is 
<br>
a truth open to any inquiring rational mind. The 
<br>
words may be changed but the referents don't.
<br>
<p>A person may not be a mathematical genius but
<br>
still be sure that one and one make two. The rest
<br>
of the mathematical domain can be built on top
<br>
of that (not by all of us and not completely) so to
<br>
some extent all of remain ignorant of mathematics
<br>
if we make ignorance or non ignorance of all
<br>
mathematics the issue. If we have to answer truthfully
<br>
to ourselves do I understand all mathematics yes or 
<br>
no or am I ignorant of the domain as an entirety (but
<br>
not elements of it) them yes, one can be ignorant.
<br>
<p>But in practical terms we take on the subject matter
<br>
in complex domains in increments. We model reality
<br>
we don't perceive the whole shebang in one hit. One
<br>
can reduce ones ignorance of the whole shebang
<br>
by degrees. But not remove ignorance of all entirely.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  and BTW - just because you achieve a lesser state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ignorance does not mean u neccesarily are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competent that someone else in the grand scheme of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things; I, for instance, though quite skilled in several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas, would not care to go head to head with a peasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the area concerning growing things.
</em><br>
<p>True. There are different domains of knowledge that each
<br>
or us can pursue. But importantly imo there are some 
<br>
domains of knowledge that all of us MUST persue or 
<br>
be in a state of bad faith with ourselves. And this is that
<br>
we must each perceive the world from the centre of 
<br>
a subjective universe and that we start doing so with 
<br>
a propensity for sociability and a capacity for rationality
<br>
and these two together gives us language which enable
<br>
us to approach to varing degrees the subjective 
<br>
universe of the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge is not an instant path to success :) The fitness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ur function depends heavily on the environment in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are competing.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. A nuclear physicist that can't swim across out
<br>
of a river when his boat sinks has in a way wasted some
<br>
of his time learning excess knowledge in one domain and
<br>
not enough in another - swimming.
<br>
<p>But I come back to my central point. All of have some 
<br>
domains in common. We all start from the subjective 
<br>
centre, we all are social, we all are rational, and we all
<br>
value our lives. Our lives are the first value to us. 
<br>
<p>And perhaps we can use these universals in domain
<br>
to good effect. Perhaps we can ground a more rational
<br>
ethics. But I digress as well as rant :-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
