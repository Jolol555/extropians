<em>&gt;I agree.  I am sure of this:  there are SOME situations in

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;There are also stories of adults bent on destroying their own lives
<br>
and the lives of people they come in contact with. How do the stories
<br>
about the teenagers differ? Is it that the stories about adults are
<br>
often invented as an excuse for politicians to exert control, but the
<br>
stories about teenagers are always told by truthful Bayesians?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now [is it evil for me to anticipate objections?], some will
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions about how the life of their kid is turning out or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will turn out.  But I have two answers.  One is that if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them, then who?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The kids, as long as they aren't doing things that ought to be considered
<br>
crimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And if they can't exert control over kids at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;age 16 then why permit them to send a kid to his room (depriving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him of freedom) and restricting his friends and when he can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them (denying him freedom of association)?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I can't think of a good reason why we should respect any parent who
<br>
imprisons kids for actions that the government shouldn't treat as crimes.
<br>
Are you aware of some argument for permitting it other than that the
<br>
means required to prevent it are sometimes unethical?
