<p><em>&gt; The universe that follows from now on need not be filled with

<em>&gt; innovations pioneered by humans will soon spread until most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all life uses it or goes extinct.  One of the most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that of law; predator/prey relations will mostly disappear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and be replaced by farmer/farmed or other much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperative relationships.  A related innovation is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialization in production; rather than have each organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce most everything it needs for itself, they will share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an economy where they specialize.
</em><br>
<p>This also suggests that there is room for many more organisms 
<br>
since the available resources will be more efficiently utilized 
<br>
by the specialized ones (or that there will exist fewer but 
<br>
wealthier organisms). 
<br>
<p>One factor which is important when looking at this kind of 
<br>
economized ecology is how complexity grows within an economy. 
<br>
How does new economical niches develop, and how stable are they?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders continued:

<p><em>&gt; &gt;complexity needs growth. But it is not enough. I'm planning

<em>&gt; &gt;growth, but it does not seem to lead to much complexity, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more and more efficiency at expanding. Here growth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;evolution seems to reduce complexity instead of enhance them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Under what circumstances do we see an evolutionary radiation
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually a richer cosmic commons model might well give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiation. What I did is more akin to modeling life in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ocean, where the main variable of interest is how close each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism is to the surface. In such a simple model, you'd get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a one-dimensional variation in strategies.
</em><br>
<p>True. But there still seems to be a rather strong force towards 
<br>
maximizing efficiency at the cost of everything else. But this 
<br>
could just be the initial growth phase; in alife simulations 
<br>
like Tierra we first see a fierce competition for maximizing 
<br>
reproductory ability, and later the development of &quot;ecological 
<br>
niches&quot; like parasites and hyperparasites. It seems likely that 
<br>
it is this second order evolution that would produce an 
<br>
interesting environment. Unfortunately it is not well understood 
<br>
at present, since most alife simulations only seem to be able to 
<br>
sustain fairly simple &quot;ecosystems&quot; (likely because of their 
<br>
size). Maybe we need more interaction between colonies in the 
<br>
commons scenario for the emergence of complexity.
<br>
<p>(Maybe it would be worth adding even more Tierra-like
<br>
&quot;programmability&quot; to the civilisations of the simulation I'm
<br>
writing so that they could actually develop open-ended
<br>
strategies. Worth thinking about...)
