<p>Oh, but there *is* something very important at stake: who you
<br>
are.  If you force a person to repeat something over and over,
<br>
most will eventually come to believe it.  All you have to do
<br>
is force someone to repeat, every day, that they deserved any
<br>
punishment that you mete out, to turn them into someone who
<br>
really believes that on some level.  I'm 30, and I haven't
<br>
yet been able to completely throw off the deep belief that I
<br>
am not deserving of success, ingrained in me by years of being
<br>
forced to repeat after my parent that I was not deserving of
<br>
good grades, etc, since I hadn't done enough work.
<br>
<p>I know, intellectually, that I'm capable, but there's something
<br>
very deep in me that is only satisfied if I'm very far from the
<br>
goal, and makes actually finishing any project harder than stopping
<br>
just shy of success.  I often &quot;come to&quot; saying &quot;What the hell am I
<br>
doing?&quot; when I find myself playing a video game for hours on end
<br>
when I would otherwise have finished a weeks-long project that day.
<br>
<p>This sort of programming can screw up your entire life.

</em><br>
<p>There's a difference between a minor inconvenience from someone who
<br>
fancies themselves in authority, and the horror of having that person
<br>
insist that you tell them that you believe that they are right, day
<br>
after day, for years.  Eventually, you'll really agree that they're
<br>
right.  You may think that you could resist that indefinitely, and
<br>
you might be right, but children are, by nature, far more malleable
<br>
than you are.
