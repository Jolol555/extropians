<p>...every email user might have the option in his email

him, in advance, by the sender, for the privilege of

the sender's message actually showing up in the

can waive it for people you trust...

<p>...Depending on how high you judge the value of your

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------
<br>
<p>An absolutely terrific idea, Rafal.  In fact it feels
<br>
like something of a 'killer app'.  
<br>
<p>Since the spam plague is widely and fiercely hated,
<br>
there's plenty of demand.  
<br>
<p>The micropayment system that is required is an
<br>
inevitability in any event and widely desired, not to
<br>
mention commercially valuable.  So if the two are
<br>
developed in concert, value is derived from both.  A
<br>
synergy of profit, like cogeneration.
<br>
<p>Most striking for me is the concept of charging for
<br>
access.  Which is recognition of the
<br>
(personal)property nature of access.  Even moreso
<br>
privacy.  
<br>
<p>I always wondered about the property issues behind
<br>
telephone solicitation calls.  How the service that
<br>
you paid for could be used by others without your
<br>
permission and against your interests.  
<br>
<p>The open access telephone system started out just
<br>
fine, but gradually evolved into a system that
<br>
permitted abuse.  Along the way, in the period when
<br>
telephone service was a kind of commons, the notion of
<br>
access as a kind of personal property was unnecessary.
<br>
&nbsp;And later when it might have been useful, the habit
<br>
of seeing the 'commons' prevented seeing the property
<br>
right. (I speculate.)
<br>
<p>In the case of telephone service, the legislature has
<br>
recently taken steps to remedy the problem.
<br>
<p>The telephone system is (or has been) mostly
<br>
unhackable hardware, though now you can interpose a
<br>
computer (ie an owner-programmable 'answering
<br>
machine') to serve as an access filter/gatekeeper.  In
<br>
contrast email--which became abusable and abused
<br>
almost as fast as it became useful--is inherently
<br>
'hackable', ie subject to ongoing modification and
<br>
enhancement.  Thus the opportunity Rafal suggests.
<br>
<p>I want some code on my desk--or in my inbox (no
<br>
charge)--by the start of next week.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
