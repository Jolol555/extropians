So here we are in thread #2. I'm going to stamp these things with [GKES] to
<br>
be kind to those with filters who don't feel like joining in. So please,
<br>
folks, be nice and keep the [GKES] if we're talking about this stuff, ok? :)
<br>
<p>Examples are good, I feel. Far easier for me to demonstrate the sort of
<br>
thing I think we need by showing you how the CR Society
<br>
(www.calorierestriction.org) does this. They post this thing once every week
<br>
or two weeks or so. Copyrighted you'll note, and reproduced completely
<br>
without permission, glee:
<br>
<p>(I continue with my comments afterwards, so scroll down by all means).

<br>
Subject: Information for newcomers
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some useful CR Society links (see CONTENTS below).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Browsing the WEB SITE and/or the FAQs will increase your CR
<br>
sophistication,
<br>
and then if you read whichever List posts interest you most, consulting the
<br>
GLOSSARY now and then along with other info mentioned below, your knowledge
<br>
and
<br>
science savvy will increase.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a post's subject line indicates how technical the post is.  If
<br>
you
<br>
see &quot;tech:&quot; right after the &quot;[CR],&quot; the post is probably pretty dense. Some
<br>
CR
<br>
List members are working scientists, and from time to time one of them
<br>
translates some source data into an easier-to-read discussion that benefits
<br>
us
<br>
all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments/updates welcomed.

<p>ANTIOXIDANTS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it seems clear that calorie restriction gives greater health
<br>
benefits than supplementation does, many List members take antioxidants as
<br>
dietary SUPPLEMENTS.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lester Packer's book /The Antioxidant Miracle/ sets forth his research
<br>
(UC
<br>
Berkeley) and that of others into the human body's antioxidant network, in
<br>
which
<br>
one nutrient regenerates another for sustained power against ROS (Reactive
<br>
Oxygen Species, AKA &quot;free radicals&quot;).  The book also tells how genes aren't
<br>
just
<br>
for reproduction.  Sections can be read online starting at
<br>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/801h">http://tinyurl.com/801h</a> (or at copy-and-paste URL
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471353116/ref=lib_dp_sp_1/104">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471353116/ref=lib_dp_sp_1/104</a>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Published in 1999, the book fails to make the important newer distinction
<br>
between alpha-lipoic acid (aLA) and R(+)-lipoic acid (R-lipoic, R-LA,
<br>
RLA)--but
<br>
the difference is laid out in the CR Society ARCHIVES.
<br>
<p>ARCHIVES

<br>
<p>BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS
<br>
-- For a good layman's book discussing genes and antioxidants, see
<br>
ANTIOXIDANTS.
<br>
--*Beyond the 120 Year Diet* by Roy Walford, M.D., tells about the evidence
<br>
showing that CR works, and describes the program in detail, with a good deal
<br>
of helpful information.  For more information and online ordering, see
<br>
<a href="http://walford.com/books.htm">http://walford.com/books.htm</a>.  Please be skeptical, though, where you see
<br>
veal
<br>
meat spoken well of as a food.  I suspect the author wasn't aware--most
<br>
people
<br>
aren't--of the excessive cruelty required for veal production
<br>
(www.peta.org/mc/facts/fsveg4.html).
<br>
(See also related reader's comment at the end of this message.)
<br>
<p>CHAT ROOMS
<br>
Chat was crackling for a while but has lessened.  There could be a
<br>
renaissance
<br>
at any time.  Waiting for a scheduled chat might be the best bet for now --
<br>
watch the List for announcements.
<br>
=====
<br>

<p>HISTORY OF THE SOCIETY
<br>
There's a brief recent history of Society advances at

<a href="http://www.calorierestriction.org/whatsnew_atTheCRS.htm">http://www.calorierestriction.org/whatsnew_atTheCRS.htm</a>.
<br>
<p>POSTING
<br>
To post an email message to the list, send your message to
<br>
crsociety@LISTS.CALORIERESTRICTION.ORG.
<br>
REPLYING TO A POST:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--SAVING SPACE:  Clicking &quot;reply&quot; probably appends the whole original
<br>
message
<br>
to your reply.  To prevent cluttering up the archives with redundancies,
<br>
edit
<br>
out all but sender, date, subject, and parts of the message that are
<br>
especially
<br>
pertinent to your own message.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--SUBJECT FIELD:  If in replying to a post you add or change even one
<br>
character of the Subject field--even to remove an extra space or correct a
<br>
misspelled word--you make it harder for a future archives reader to follow
<br>
the
<br>
whole thread.  (If the discussion's meandered, though, maybe it's time
<br>
to change the Subject field so it describes the new topic.)
<br>
<p>RECEIVING TOO MANY CR MESSAGES?
<br>
If too many posts are flooding into your Inbox, consider changing to digest
<br>
mode
<br>
(see SUBSCRIPTION CHANGES below).  Or, if your email reader permits, you can
<br>
set
<br>
up a filter (message handling rule) that automatically routes incoming
<br>
CR posts into a designated folder/directory.
<br>
<p>RECIPES
<br>
The Society's online cookbook automatically calculates a nutrition profile
<br>
for
<br>
each recipe.
<br>

<br>

<a href="http://recipes.calorierestriction.org/AddressBook/signup/signup.view">http://recipes.calorierestriction.org/AddressBook/signup/signup.view</a>,

but some difficulties with the process are being worked out.)
<br>
<p>RESEARCH STUDY (human)
<br>
For participation in or information about the Human Calorie Restriction
<br>
Study

<br>
<p>SUBSCRIBING
<br>
To start a new subscription to the CR Society's email List,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Go to &quot;Join or leave the CRSOCIETY list&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://lists.calorierestriction.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=crsociety&amp;A=1">http://lists.calorierestriction.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=crsociety&amp;A=1</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Enter your email address and your name.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Select the options you want--there's a pertinent discussion under
<br>
SUBSCRIPTION CHANGES below (or leave the default options in place);
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Click &quot;Join the list.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Wait for a &quot;confirmation request&quot; email message to arrive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Click on its link.
<br>
<p>SUBSCRIPTION CHANGES
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can change from regular mode (receiving lots of separate messages
<br>
every
<br>
day) to a digest mode (receiving just one &quot;digest&quot; containing the day's
<br>
messages) or vice versa.  Of the digest formats, the one called &quot;Digest
<br>
(HTML
<br>
format) [HTML DIGEST]&quot; has a nice table of contents and will probably be
<br>
most
<br>
satisfactory unless your browser is quite old.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other subscription changes offered involve mail header style, type of
<br>
acknowledgement for posts you send, temporary disabling of CR list mail
<br>
delivery, and address concealment.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience, the only always-reliable way to make a subscription
<br>
change
<br>
is to unsubscribe (see UNSUBSCRIBING below) and then subscribe again (see
<br>
SUBSCRIBING above), choosing the desired options when you re-subscribe.  If
<br>
you
<br>
wait 'til after 10 pm USA Pacific Time, you probably won't miss any posts
<br>
during
<br>
the brief time you're unsubscribed.  You can make sure you haven't by
<br>
checking
<br>
with another List member, or by checking the ARCHIVES--though it can take
<br>
some
<br>
days for the archives to be updated.
<br>
<p>SUPPLEMENTS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research has uncovered reasons why it's best to obtain nutrients from
<br>
food
<br>
wherever possible.  Research also shows that in some cases (antioxidant
<br>
vitamin
<br>
E complex, etc.) food alone can't supply enough.  The List and the ARCHIVES
<br>
hold
<br>
discussions of studies done on supplemental molecules including benfotiamin
<br>
(inhibitor of Advanced Glycation Endproduct formation), bone/artery
<br>
nutrients
<br>
vitamin K2 and strontium (non-radioactive!), and some of the ANTIOXIDANTS
<br>
(which
<br>
are not interchangeable!)--as well as dangers involved in supplementing
<br>
certain
<br>
vitamin A and E molecules.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information about demonstrated-value supplements, including
<br>
criteria
<br>
for deciding which companies to trust, and a product/price list for (mostly)
<br>
A*O*R* supplements, contact Lynn Martin at dayrain@earthlink.net.

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclosure:  The writer of this post is a distributor of anti-aging
<br>

<br>
supplements, and has a financial interest in this activity.
<br>
<p>UNSUBSCRIBING
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might consider changing to a &quot;digest&quot; version of the posts, which
<br>
you'd
<br>
receive as just one email message per day (see SUBSCRIPTION CHANGES above).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to unsubscribe:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Go to &quot;Join or leave the CRSOCIETY list&quot; at
<br>
<a href="http://lists.calorierestriction.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=crsociety&amp;A=1">http://lists.calorierestriction.org/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=crsociety&amp;A=1</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Enter your email address and click &quot;Leave the list.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Wait one to fifteen minutes for a &quot;confirmation request&quot; email
<br>
message
<br>
to arrive in your Inbox.  (Steps 3 and 4 prevent someone else from
<br>
unsubscribing
<br>
you without permission.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Click on the link in the confirmation request to complete the
<br>
unsubscription process.

<br>
<p>Oh, and the PETA slipped in there too. All sales pitches. Hmm. Still,
<br>
steering by committee will do that to you.
<br>
<p>Here's the pertinent reductionist points that I think would be useful to
<br>
include in our version of this here miniFAQ:
<br>
<p>1) It points you to places where you can find more information about the
<br>
list hosting organization
<br>
<p>2) It tells you a little bit about the list hosting organization
<br>
<p>3) It tells you a little bit about the list culture, rules and &quot;rules&quot;, what
<br>
to expect, how to deal
<br>
<p>4) It points you to places online to read more about what the list is there
<br>
to discuss
<br>
<p>5) It points you to other places online where this topic is also discussed
<br>
<p>6) It answers the few beginner-level questions that can arise; how to
<br>
unsubscribe, answers to the first thing everyone asks, where's the bathroom,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Basically, what we're after is something that jumps you directly from the
<br>
functional equivalent of [clueless newbie who joined after one scan of the
<br>
ExI site] to [someone who's lurked and actually listened for a month or
<br>
two]. I don't think that should be terribly hard to do in two pages or so.
<br>
Very valuable thing to have.
<br>
<p>So, pitch in with comments, because a draft will be coming from me if you
<br>
don't -- and trust me, you don't want that without the comments first.
