<em>&gt; &gt; Not at all. If you wish to express it in these terms, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question I was getting at is: &quot;What is the price of the ABSENCE 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a moral code?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Point taken.  I might offer that perhaps there are 3 codes --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a legal code, a moral code and an instinctual code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The instinctual code seems dependent on our genetic makeup
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (currently fixed -- but likely not for long).  The moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code seems highly society dependent (witness &quot;eye for an eye&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors in Iraq or Turkey which have been the discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of recent news articles).  The legal code seems quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bendable [at least over time] (witness the recent PBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specials documenting how the wives of Henry VIII were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated using varieties of court/church/political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;law&quot; all the way up to the the Japanese internment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during WWII -- &quot;The Fred Korematsu Story&quot; and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Supreme Court was manipulated by the Justice Dept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce a verdict that still seems to hang over our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads).
</em><br>
<p>Which one is that? The one that legalized the mass murder of tens of
<br>
millions of pre-natal people by the majority demographic in the US? Or
<br>
is it the one from 1939 that no court can seem to interpret
<br>
consistently (US v Miller) in which the Justice Dept is documented to
<br>
have lied three times in their arguments before the court? Or is it US
<br>
v Emerson, where the Justice Department under Clinton lied and argued
<br>
contrary to the overwhelming weight of legal scholarship?
<br>
<p>If you are instead talking about the Bush v Gore decision, I'd first
<br>
like to hear such a claim from someone who has a) actually read the
<br>
Florida election laws as they existed at the time of the election, b)
<br>
seen the documentation of the DNC approval of the ballots, and c)
<br>
actually read the SCOTUS decision on Bush v Gore. I'd also ask such a
<br>
person who they prefer to believe, perhaps the word of a member of the
<br>
Daley clan, a family of serial election criminals going back a century?
<br>
<p>SCOTUS decisions with regard to the Japanese Interment or the SCOTUS
<br>
decision about the military prosecution of Nazi saboteurs? I'd like to
<br>
hear such arguments from anybody who can actually claim any sort of
<br>
training in the application of the Geneva Conventions. I have yet to
<br>
hear of any such individuals on this list, and all the liberals I hear
<br>
in the media also seem to have never studied them either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Against those 3 codes -- I would still offer up the questions of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- (a) Are the rules of the code(s) worth the sacrifice of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    who would uphold it (or believe in it) [or benefit from it]?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, then the question would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to become &quot;How many current lives -- and how many future lives --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    are you willing to sacrifice for such principle(s)?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Depends on who those people are who lose their lives. It's the old &quot;If
<br>
you could have killed Hitler&quot; debate. All lives are not equal in value.
<br>
It depends on a) how enlightened they are, and b) whether or not they
<br>
intend on acting against those more enlightened.
<br>
<p>If you are talking about complete extinction, perhaps, for example,
<br>
given the choice of dropping a dino killer asteroid to prevent the
<br>
takeover of the planet by Hyper-Nazis, I'd say you have more options
<br>
than that at your disposal.
<br>
<p>Poor application of morals gets you into such quandaries. For example,
<br>
misinterpretation of the 'thou shall not kill' aphorism gets you into
<br>
all sorts of moral binds. A proper interpretation of 'thou shall not
<br>
murder' (a completely different standard) alleviates one from the sort
<br>
of binds that the first gets you into. For example, assasinating evil
<br>
leaders would be wrong under the first but okay under the second.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I'm attempting to force one into a position of doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triage (what lives do I allow to be lost now?) as well as performing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a discount value analysis of the net worth of current vs. future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human lives.
</em><br>
<p>Again, it is which specific lives you are talking about.
