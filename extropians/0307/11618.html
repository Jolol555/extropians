</em><br>
<p>Are you autistic?  Historical villains have killed millions of people in 
<br>
terrible causes, but the idea that it's too inconvenient to think about 
<br>
the subject, and that dropping nukes would save time and aggravation, may 
<br>
well represent a new low for the human species.  That takes work.  It's 
<br>
not something to be proud of.
<br>
<p>I doubt the words you're playing games with have the vaguest connection to 
<br>
reality in your mind.  I doubt you could kill a single human being at 
<br>
close quarters.  But then, it's a sad and terrifying truth that it's 
<br>
easier on the emotions to drop a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima then to stab 
<br>
one person through the stomach, because knifing a person sets off our 
<br>
built-in instincts and pressing a button does not.  Technological distance 
<br>
is emotional distance, as Dave Grossman put it in &quot;On Killing&quot;.  And how 
<br>
easy it is for people who can't distinguish word games from reality to 
<br>
arrange a few thoughts in the right order and decide to commit genocide. 
<br>
The human mind has no safety catch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok, I *know* you are going to rake me over the coals again.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose none of us have reasons for this.  Even for flamebait, the 
<br>
horror you're suggesting here is enough to get my attention.  Because you 
<br>
genuinely seem to be serious.  I wish I could say I don't understand it, 
<br>
but I do, and I'm sad, and frightened, because you were someone I used to 
<br>
respect.  Even if you don't understand what you're saying, even if it has 
<br>
no connection to reality for you, you said it, and I can't make it unreal 
<br>
to myself.
<br>
<p>Oh, well, I've wasted 15 minutes and hence around 1500 human lives writing 
<br>
this reply.  You'd better slit your wrists to make sure it doesn't happen 
<br>
again.
