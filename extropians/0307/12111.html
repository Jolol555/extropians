[Brett] Another duty of the federal government is the 'general welfare'
<br>
of the economy, i.e. its economic vitality and long term stability (i.e.
<br>
NOT nanny statism). If high paying skilled manufacturing jobs are being
<br>
shipped overseas or replaced by automation, leaving just poorly paid
<br>
burger flipping jobs in their place, this is a constitutional concern of
<br>
the federal government because it deals in not just the long term
<br>
economic stability of the nation, but its political stability as well.
<br>
<p>[Brett] Even worse, a government that allows the export of not just its
<br>
high paying manufacturing jobs overseas, but its higher paying knowledge
<br>
jobs overseas is asking for only one possible result: the reinstitution
<br>
of feudalism, because all that will be left are wealthy stockholders and
<br>
lots and lots of burger flippers and blue jeans sales people, and
<br>
garbage collectors, etc etc etc. i.e. an aristocracy of educated elites
<br>
and a majority of uneducated and unskilled wage slaves.
<br>
<p>[Me] Buckle up bub; 'cause thats precisely where we're headed.

They had a *REALLY* interesting piece of research done recently;
<br>
it had to do with income distribution versus percentage of the
<br>
population...
<br>
apparently everywhere else in the world, the top x% of the population
<br>
controlled a significant amount of the [fiscal] resources.... and the US
<br>
had
<br>
a significantly larger X than europe or other countries...Pretty much
<br>
the
<br>
exception to the rule.  
<br>
<p>Anyways; it turns out there was a direct analogue
<br>
for the computational problem which had already been solved [or rather
<br>
directly observed and studied] in physics which explained why the
<br>
tendency
<br>
for the rich to become ultra-rich (control all the resources)...  
<br>
<p>Of course, they were puzzled by the US score [histogram];  that is until
<br>
they
<br>
computed the score using figures in the 1950's :)  Apparently we're in
<br>
the
<br>
decline (or rather the slide) into exactly the same situation that
<br>
plagues 
<br>
every other country.
