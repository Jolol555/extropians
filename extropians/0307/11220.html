<p>
Randall made quite a few comments in this thread, which
<br>
sounded very reasonable to me, especially in the light
<br>
that he's an admitted anarchist!   (Ah, for the days 
<br>
when only criminals were anarchists --- it was against
<br>
the law, you know, to be one --- and the epithet &quot;Anarchist!&quot;
<br>
was as wounding as &quot;Communist!&quot; or &quot;racist!&quot;.  But then...
<br>
in those days they threw bombs off-line as well as on-line.
<br>
<p>But now Rafal has written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Persons of disagreeable disposition (such as you assume this girl must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be) can be asked to leave one's house. Nobody &quot;has&quot; to live with someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that. Incarceration without crime (or maybe I should say, for the crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of not meeting one's parents' expectations) is simply wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, then at what age may one ask a child to leave one's house?
<br>
<p>Oh, I get it!  :-)  Good one.  You may *ask* all that
<br>
you want!  It is a free country!  It's just that you
<br>
cannot *tell* a child to leave.  Haw haw haw!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Here is a true disconnect: I, as a committed non-rebel, cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; grok how when there is nothing important at stake, people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be so stubborn?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Lee, I cannot fathom the disconnect between your beliefs as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian, that personal freedom and self-ownership are crucial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unassailable rights, and your willingness to condone the most egregious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breaches of rights, if they happen to be inflicted on children. Aside from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the infamous &quot;I-word&quot; debate, which was somewhat academic, you actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support a real-life example of sadistic oppression, comparable to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain-washing of US POW's in Vietnamese camps (minus the death/bodily harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat, but offset by a feeling of total abandonment, having absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody to turn to, that the humans at Tranquility Bay must feel).
</em><br>
<p>I must via an act of imagination transport myself to these 
<br>
scenes of coercion, and also suppose that I had been in on
<br>
all the information and discussions leading up to whatever
<br>
punishment the parents are dealing out.
<br>
<p>Randall was quite right to point out how extremely bad are
<br>
many parents at raising children.  I would also point out
<br>
how extremely bad some children are at behaving appropriately.
<br>
But were I to have this magical knowledge, I have no idea
<br>
what percentage of the time I would side with the children.
<br>
<p>But for me to &quot;side&quot; with someone---what comes of it, anyway?
<br>
Yes, it is good to kick the memes around, and I'm all for that.
<br>
Do you think that there are any cases *whatsoever* that you
<br>
would do what these parents are doing?
<br>
<p>As for children's &quot;[legal] rights&quot;, we ought to try some
<br>
things and see.  Randall properly retorted that history
<br>
can hardly be an infallible guide, so I am all in favor
<br>
of letting some communities enact laws against transporting
<br>
children against their wills, or against infanticide.  For
<br>
all I care, they may experiment with giving children the
<br>
right to vote (locally), or giving them the same rights
<br>
to go about the house that the adults have.
<br>
<p>Now, normally I would say the same about adults: if a 
<br>
community wants to ban pornography magazines or bibles,
<br>
it should be their decision, or if they only want to let
<br>
black people vote, it's none of my business.  However,
<br>
it's my belief that history has shown that modern nations
<br>
especially must---if they are to thrive and prosper---
<br>
make a written commitment to citizens, guaranteeing freedom
<br>
of speech, and the freedom to vote, and that moreover, 
<br>
&quot;citizen&quot; must be taken to mean *all* adults.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, by all means let the states and communities
<br>
try what they would like.
<br>
<p>Lee
