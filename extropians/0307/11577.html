Natasha,
<br>
<p>I'm hesitant to go compiling a list of particular posts I think to be
<br>
the _cause._ As has come up subsequently in this thread, there's a lot
<br>
of talking and little action.  And most of the bickering seems to be
<br>
about the talking.
<br>
<p>There's a general perception among members of groups that actively
<br>
self-select for intelligence that intelligence somehow inherently has
<br>
value, and that an overall increase in intelligence increases the Good
<br>
that can be accomplished.  To me, this seems silly.  Intelligence is just
<br>
a very poor measure of a myriad of very slippery properties of humans.
<br>
&quot;Intelligence&quot; as we measure it doesn't correlate to social status,
<br>
political affiliation, professional capability or competence, or,
<br>
really, to anything but the ability to argue endlessly about minutia.
<br>
There feels, to me, to be a high degree of out-of-touchness among
<br>
extropians on the list.
<br>
<p>Analogously, Silicon Valley has a higher-than-average (and increasing)
<br>
instance of autism.  One explanation that's been offered is the
<br>
reproductive over-selecting for intelligence that inherently goes on here.
<br>
<p>;-)
<br>
<p>These are some thoughts.  I hope this is useful to people, and not
<br>
perceived as unwarranted criticism.  I've definitely gotten a fair number
<br>
of &quot;me-too&quot; offlist responses, so other people do feel this way.
<br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The perspective of an infrequent poster:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My reading of extropians has definitely fallen off seriously in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six months.  The bickering and sniping represents a large percentage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the volume of the list.  It becomes tedious to have to slog through it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out which discussions have content, and where that content is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've gotten a very good sense of which list members lie where on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the content-generation distribution, and I've killfiled a half-dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people--I've found that it's made the list much more readable.  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do consider unsubscribing pretty frequently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a shame--the list is so full of bright, ambitious people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting and compelling visions of humanity's future, both near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and far.  But, as with every other online discussion forum I've ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participated in, the more intelligent and ambitious we get, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; childish, self-important and myopic we become when we feel our hard-won
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and excruciatingly-thought-out paradigms being queried or challenged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing that frequently strikes me about the list is the degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant certainty with which the list members state predictions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future.  Frankly, if anyone here could predict the future (or, hell,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the present) with any degree of precision, they wouldn't have time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sit around posting to this list, because they'd be spending every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waking moment _heavily_ involved in some other, extremely important works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, yeah, it's a serious problem, and I think you'd see a lot less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attrition if it weren't.
