<em>&gt; Damien Broderick:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree that Robert was not *advising* anyone to murder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 10^8 human beings, nor would his advice have any force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with those so empowered if he *had* urged that course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than just raising it for consideration. Not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is a better analogy:  you are in a bar having a very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polite discussion with highly intelligent people (read very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polite discussion with highly intelligent Extropians on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forum) and after a long time, a young black woman says,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with no white people within earshot (read no North Koreans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing to our discussion) &quot;you know, I have so had it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with white people that if I had a vial of a killer virus that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would just wipe them all out, I'd break open that vial!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what would you say to her?  Scream at the top of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lungs what an evil horrible mass-murdering racist she was?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not I!  
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I respect your opinion on this but I believe you're missing an
<br>
important social dynamic.
<br>
<p>If I say something truly stupid or despicable and some stranger yells
<br>
at me, it will be counterproductive on their part.  My defenses will
<br>
go up.
<br>
<p>If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a friend of mine,
<br>
someone who I respect, mildly tells me that I should reconsider, I may
<br>
or may not pay it much heed, or realize just how egregious a statement
<br>
I've made.
<br>
<p>If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a friend of mine,
<br>
someone who I respect, reacts with obvious dismay and tells me quite
<br>
strongly that what I've just said is dangerous, then I will take note.
<br>
My defenses may rise, but because I trust, like, and admire the
<br>
person, I will listen.  Most importantly, I will realize that this is
<br>
really an important topic to them, and that I should devote some
<br>
attention to their opinion.  If they had spoken mildly, I might have
<br>
missed that.  
<br>
<p>As someone who wasn't involved in the conversation, I believe this
<br>
third case most accurately reflects the exchange between Robert,
<br>
Damien, and Eliezer.  
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
mez
