<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Well, I don't think so, nor do many others who have emailed me with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;their support. Nor can you point to any actual accomplishments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;The Luddites continue to win, legislatively, commercially, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;public sentiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have said this to you many time, Mike:  Start your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organization.  If you can do it better than anyone else, then do it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That isn't the point. You claimed that you were achieving things. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asked you to name them. You can't, so you deflect.
</em><br>
<p>For goodness sakes, calm down.  I cannot openly discuss ExI business 
<br>
without board consent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I am not the person to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blaming.  The fact that I did not pass on the baton for Pro-Act is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (1) no one qualified to take it on emailed me asking to help out;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i.e. when I emailed you, offering my help and support, and I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absolutely no response from you, it is because you thought I was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualified... which confirms my earlier statement that you used Pro-Act
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to deflect the community from supporting my efforts which preceded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yours.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't want Pro-Act to go in a overly libertarian direction.  You are 
<br>
very committed to libertarian ideas and I am not very committed to any 
<br>
political party, as I don't see one that is futuristic enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; (2) I could not think of any one person who was objective enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take it on;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which only demonstrates you have no idea what it takes to run an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activist organization. Objectivism doesn't count as a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualification, moreover your opinion of me as not being objective is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only because my anti-Green leanings conflict with your Green leanings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How objective is that on your part?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say &quot;objectivism&quot;, I said &quot;objective.  I am not a Green Party 
<br>
member and I do not support the Green Party in any way, shape or form.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; (3) I was not sure if Pro-Act was indeed the right direction to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; go in with dealing with the current political and social global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anti-biotechnology leanings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then why did you even start it? Perhaps because you saw my efforts as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threat to your position as the queen of extropia?
</em><br>
<p>I'll just let this slip by because it is so ridiculous that I don't want to 
<br>
answer it. You are not a threat to me, Mike.  Although we are in different 
<br>
universes, it would better to be supportive of one another.  I don't think 
<br>
you really want to burn bridges with me.
<br>
<p>Moving on:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the latest newsletter I asked people to comment.  That would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been a great opportunity to you to communicate with me about what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are doing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cut the horseshit, Natasha. I've attempted to communicate with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several times over the last two years about this issue and I've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;totally rebuffed. Greg Burch knows this because I've communicated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him my concerns and asked him what the hell is going on with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people. You have not returned any of my emails about this issue since Extro5.
</em><br>
<p>Above, I was referring to your claim that ExI is not doing anything.  I 
<br>
listed several items we are currently working on in the newsletters.
<br>
<p>Now on a different subject and one you mention above, which is not what I 
<br>
was talking about above, You want to know about your attempts to 
<br>
communicate with me and your communicating with Greg about working on 
<br>
Pro-Act or questioning what happened to Pro-Act.  I remember you 
<br>
criticizing me and then stating on the list that you were going to start 
<br>
your own organization.  I never saw it and thought that you either formed 
<br>
it and were still working on it, or decided not to form it.
<br>
