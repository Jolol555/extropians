<p>This all sounds very reasonable, but there is still a big piece of the 
<br>
puzzle missing: why does believing that one is acting for the good of 
<br>
the tribe win public support? Why doesn't evolution make the public 
<br>
realize that the person is self-deceived (or &quot;evolutionarily deceived&quot;) 
<br>
when he says that the public good is served by him taking absolute 
<br>
power?
<br>
<p>We seem to still lack a theory of self-deception that explains why it is
<br>
an evolutionarily stable strategy. Without this I'm starting to have
<br>
doubts on the whole concept. Perhaps the dictator erroneously believing
<br>
that taking absolute power is good for the public is simply a case of
<br>
maladaptation, not self-deception, and in ancestral environments it was
<br>
actually good for the tribe?
<br>
<p>Robin thinks self-deception explains why people undergo journeys of
<br>
self-discovery. But a simpler explanation may be that the optimal
<br>
weighting of health, comfort, status, etc., depends on the environment and
<br>
one's genetic endowment, and the &quot;journey&quot; is just a process of figuring
<br>
out the optimum.
