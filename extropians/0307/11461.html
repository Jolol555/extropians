<p>
One of the problems that I see is that people tend to place themselves into
<br>
groups to which they do not belong. For example, people join churches based
<br>
on social status rather than a set of congruous beliefs. The fact that we
<br>
are social animals leads us to join groups simply because we feel the need
<br>
to be part of a group.
<br>
<p>The internet may be changing that already. The fact that we can locate
<br>
groups that more accurately reflect our thoughts and beliefs allows people
<br>
like me to find a group such as this one.
<br>
<p>Hypocrisy is being reduced generation by generation. The pictures in our
<br>
heads of the glorious goodness of the 50s persists only because the people
<br>
practiced hypocrisy so well. All the talk was of goodness while the dirty
<br>
businesses of sex and drugs amongst other vices, was going on behind closed
<br>
doors.
<br>
<p>Much of this is in the open now. It is not difficult to find someone in
<br>
today's society that will stand up and say &quot;I'm a perverted S&amp;M freak&quot; or
<br>
&quot;I'm gay&quot;, or &quot;I'm an atheist&quot;. Mixed race couples were very, very rare; and
<br>
usually secretive. 50 years ago these same people would have said &quot;I'm a
<br>
good Christian&quot;, or &quot;I'm straight&quot;.
<br>
<p>Society for the most part seems to have accepted much of this; with a bit of
<br>
a grudge of course. With the advent of the internet, as long as it does not
<br>
become censored, I expect this trend to continue. Maybe one day, we will
<br>
have the ability to read each other's thoughts. This may help as well.
<br>
Hypocracy will never end as long as the social animals continue to care
<br>
about what other's think, but maybe it will be reduced to the meager day to
<br>
day aspects of life rather than showing its ugly head in public policy
<br>
decisions.

Subject: The End of Hypocrisy? (was: Why Does Self-Discovery Require a
<br>
Journey?)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This thread seems to have bogged down into a largely fruitless discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what the word &quot;want&quot; should mean, and a potentially fruitful but slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion of whether it is good (or right) to give people what they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or what they say they want.  Let me try a different approach and ask: what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the prospects for ending, or at least greatly reducing, hypocrisy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans seem to have evolved so that most people espouse &quot;high&quot; ideals
</em><br>
while
<br>
<em>&gt; their inclination to actually follow those ideals is primarily driven by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social pressure.  People self-deceive enough so that they usually do no
</em><br>
see
<br>
<em>&gt; the conflicts between their ideals and their actions.  Others are better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to see through such deception, and may or may not use that as a basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of social pressure.  Some people have less hypocrisy, either by raising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their actions to their ideals, or lowering their ideals to their actions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but these are a clear minority.  And the ideals of some are not the ideals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of others; for example, some hold ideals of racial or cultural purity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncompromising revenge against longtime enemies, or the restoration of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-free nature.  (Ideals seem to be less consistent than, and to vary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than, actions.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three questions come to mind:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) To what extent might we expect humans or their descendants to reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their hypocrisy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) If they do, in which direction will the resolution be, toward current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideals or actions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Will such a reduction in hypocrisy be a good thing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One approach to reducing hypocrisy is preaching, i.e., pointing out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people how their actions fall short of their ideals.  This seems to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly played itself out; preaching has been long tried and our ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-deceive seems robust against it.  Perhaps such preaching will be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective when aided by more detailed descriptions of how evolution helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us to self-deceive, but I see little evidence of this in the behavior of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who best understand evolutionary psychology and self-deception.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jury is still out here though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another approach to reducing hypocrisy is social pressure enhanced by more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency.  Our tendency to hypocrisy evolved in small tribes where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency is far higher than in our modern society.  But perhaps a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future society will be even more transparent, for example letting us see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other's thoughts.  However, it is not clear that social pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always reduces self-deception and hypocrisy; on some issues it may well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase hypocrisy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A third approach to reducing hypocrisy is a more totalitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy.  Democracy seems to induce people to vote their ideals, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are almost no other personal consequences of your vote besides how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that vote modifies your self-image.  So the more kinds of behavior are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictated by a totalitarian democracy, the more such behavior might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictated by shared ideals. This tendency might be restrained by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international competition, if some ideals make nations lose such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition, but democratic world government might be less restrained.
</em><br>
