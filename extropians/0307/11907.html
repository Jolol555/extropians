<p>
I'm reading a story about a protagonist who realizes
<br>
one day that the whole world is being run by a sinister
<br>
cabal.  This evil agency not only runs everything, but
<br>
monitors every single person in the world 24x7.
<br>
<p>He becomes extremely dismayed at learning about this,
<br>
but has tremendous self-control, and gives no outward
<br>
sign that he now is on to THEM.
<br>
<p>He knows very well that if he spills the beans about
<br>
THEM, then he will quickly and quietly disappear.
<br>
What to do?
<br>
<p>He decides that it's possible that his outward self-control
<br>
is not so complete as he thought, and that THEY may be
<br>
onto *him* even so.  Therefore, he decides to act perfectly
<br>
natural for at least two years, so as to cause THEM to
<br>
lose any suspicion of him that THEY may have.  Hence he
<br>
goes about his life exactly as if nothing had happened.
<br>
<p>Now quite a bit positive must be said about the cabal.
<br>
THEY were responsible for Hitler's defeat in World War
<br>
Two, and for the fall of the Soviet Union.  Indeed,
<br>
THEY work closely with the Tri-Lateral Commission (one
<br>
of THEIR fronts), and insure world peace and prosperity.
<br>
(Up to a point.  They really care very little about
<br>
people dying in faraway places so long as it doesn't
<br>
interfere with their profits.  They also stage small
<br>
wars (like the invasion of Iraq) just to divert the
<br>
populaces.)
<br>
<p>Well, as the protagonist continues to dwell about this
<br>
over the next day or two, he becomes more and more angry,
<br>
and becomes more and more determined to resist THEM.
<br>
<p>But he has one worry.  He was reading the &quot;Tranquility Bay&quot;
<br>
thread (okay, I'm making some of this up) on the Extropians
<br>
mail list, and was mightily impressed by Randall's point
<br>
concerning that if you submit to authority for any period
<br>
of time, you can indeed lose your will to resist.  You
<br>
become brainwashed.  You find that pretending to &quot;go
<br>
along&quot; metamorphoses into the reality.
<br>
<p>Now the present world that the Cabal has created *does*
<br>
work better than the old world---as I say, he must give
<br>
them credit for that.  But he still *hates* the idea of
<br>
this secret group running everything and spying on everyone
<br>
all the time.
<br>
<p>The question is, how accurate is his worry that by &quot;playing
<br>
along&quot; with the system for two more years, he will compromise
<br>
his own resistance?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
