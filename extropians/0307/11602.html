<em>&gt; &gt; This latest one was a lot more personal and spilled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over into the real world.  I am not going to rehash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it or go into details again.  However, previous flame-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wars were more about people's ideas or actions on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; list.  The latest flame-wars included accusations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; real-world activities off-list regarding suspected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; support of different sides of the War on Iraq.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also were vague accusations against ExI as an organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and against its officers for some sort of ill-defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political misconduct.  We also saw reports of off-list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussions, rumors and activities beyond the on-list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussion.  We have never seen this level of coordination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before, with this number of concurrent targets, nor this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amount of off-list activity before.  This truly was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something new for our list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly WHAT list was this on? I seem to have missed this alleged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; episode entirely.
</em><br>
<p>What Harvey is referring to by &quot;this level of coordination&quot;
<br>
etc., is an incident that resulted from his complaining to
<br>
the then-current list monitor of personal attacks.  His
<br>
story
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Seriously, I don't think the list has yet recovered from the latest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flame-war and series of personal attacks that caused ExI to start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moderating again.  
</em><br>
<p>fails to mention his key role.  The &quot;monitoring&quot; only occurred
<br>
following his own complaint.  The list moderator, in a clumsily
<br>
worded effort, then literally told some list participants &quot;not
<br>
to reply&quot; (period) to those that they were fighting with.
<br>
<p>Some of those who received such notices emailed me, and asked
<br>
&quot;what gives?&quot;, asking, in effect, &quot;is it fair that I have been
<br>
told not to reply?&quot;  I then began a dialog with the list moderator
<br>
about what the moderator had said.  The situation was not cleared
<br>
up, in my opinion, until a (new) list moderator made it perfectly
<br>
clear that one may reply all one wishes to any post or poster,
<br>
simply that (of course, per the list rules) one may not engage
<br>
in personal attacks.  So this is what is meant, I infer, by
<br>
&quot;this [unprecedented] level of coordination... this amount of
<br>
off-list activity&quot;.
<br>
<p>So, Mike, I don't think that it was really a big deal, though
<br>
taxing for those of us worrying that finally after all these
<br>
years maybe speech on the Extropian list would not be free.
<br>
But free it has remained, not surprisingly.
<br>
<p>Lee
