</em><br>
<p>In this case I would have to side with Hubert -- there are extreme
<br>
cases where one has to whack someone in the side of the head to get
<br>
them to &quot;reevaluate his/her thoughts&quot; (myself included).
<br>
<p>But it seems likely that it is better to wade into the discussion
<br>
gracefully rather than resort to A.H. from the git-go.  [I believe
<br>
there are several examples of such graceful entries in recent exchanges
<br>
with respect to my rather blunt proposal.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When Robert Bradbury made his sick nuking proposal the other day, he did

</em><br>
<p>Yep, I'll plead guilty, on some days I'm a hard-core extropian --
<br>
i.e. we either advance civilization as fast as we possibly can
<br>
(complexification) or we might as well write it all off now as
<br>
a pointless exercise (odds are given our current understanding
<br>
of physics we all end up dead anyway) -- so all you are arguing
<br>
for is the extension of an entirely futile existence for billions
<br>
of people who happen to think they have &quot;free will&quot; (realizing
<br>
of course that their experience of &quot;pleasure&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;free will&quot;,
<br>
etc. has been dictated by a random set evolutionary accidents.
<br>
Evolution doesn't care whether humanity survives or becomes extinct.
<br>
If you are going to propose that we should &quot;care&quot; about humanity
<br>
then you need to explain what parts of it we should save and why.
<br>
<p>If I walk up to you on the street, pour gasoline all over you
<br>
and light a match tossing it onto your clothing resulting in
<br>
your rather painful death -- are you going to seriously argue
<br>
that the small subset of &quot;humanity&quot; (that I represent) should
<br>
be preserved?
<br>
<p>I will plead guilty to engaging in a &quot;glass bead game&quot; -- the problems
<br>
with which I think were dealt with very well in terms of looking at the
<br>
time value of current vs. future lives.  I don't think the problem is
<br>
resolved, but I am comfortable where more work is required.
<br>
<p>With regard to functioning as a fill-in for &quot;Hitler, Goering and Goebbels&quot;
<br>
you will have a hard time making such labels stick.
<br>
<p>The reasons for this are as follows:
<br>
a) I have no agenda of my own to push (the only agenda I am looking at is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the extropian agenda which I view as a possible path for the maximization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the longevity of intelligence in the universe);
<br>
b) I don't strongly care if I survive.
<br>
<p>Given (b), I should be viewed as a Palestinian terrorist -- my survival is of
<br>
little importance if a state is established and flourishes.  (In my situation
<br>
the &quot;state&quot; would be one that allows the greatest complexity and longest
<br>
survival of the entities creating such complexity in the universe).
<br>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: I am not suggesting an extropian state should be established
<br>
or what the policies of extropians should be.  I *am* suggesting that if
<br>
humans that are alive now seek the long term survival of &quot;humanity&quot; that
<br>
they may need to expand their thinking.
<br>
<p>Anders grasped the problem -- it is one of &quot;triage&quot; -- one that is dealt
<br>
with by physicians from time to time (perhaps more often than they would
<br>
like).  Like it or not -- there are people out there who are making daily
<br>
decisions with respect to who will live and who will die.  He also hit it
<br>
on the head when he cited the &quot;present value argument&quot; -- we do not have
<br>
an effective way of assigning a value to a life now (given its influence
<br>
over the next 100 years) vs. the value of a life a century from now (given
<br>
its influence over 1000 years or even a million years).  Given this problem
<br>
it is hard for me to compare 10^8 current human lives to 10^14 human lives
<br>
(per second).  I would suggest that human minds are simply unable to grasp
<br>
what would be a loss of something like 10 trillion human lives (per century)
<br>
because even &quot;Hitler, Goering and Goebbels&quot; didn't think as big.
<br>
<p>One does the discussion a disservice when one simply faults it rather
<br>
than identifying:
<br>
a) when it is reasonable to terminate a human life;
<br>
b) when such termination might support extropianism (e.g. non-entropic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directions -- since (a) is probably a mix of entropic and extropic vectors)
<br>
c) productive human directions that rely on the complexity of tradeoffs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(particularly re: bioethics debates as people at the WTA and Anders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have suggested) -- we may probably agree that such discussions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been hijacked for political purposes at this time -- but that doesn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negate the long term guidance and usefullness of such discussions.
