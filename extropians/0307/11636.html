<p><em>&gt; &gt; We can maintain the spirit of Crocker's rules while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still being open, diplomatic, kind and honest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find that most people quote Crocker's rules as an excuse to participate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insulting or ad hominem attacks in violation of the list rules.  I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure if Crocker's rules and the current list rules are compatible.
</em><br>
<p>I myself have always declined to &quot;accept&quot; Crocker's rules.
<br>
They always struck me as a radical and immature attempt
<br>
to ignore traditions that had evolved for good reason.
<br>
Now I admit that this is not an easy topic; recall the
<br>
Japanese business ministers who in frustration announced
<br>
at the beginning of a meeting:  &quot;This meeting will be 
<br>
conducted in English.&quot;  (The step was necessary in their
<br>
eyes because some frank things needed to be said to certain
<br>
people---frank yet by our standards, I am sure, not insulting
<br>
---and the very structure of the Japanese language made that
<br>
too difficult.
<br>
<p>Yet the point is that politeness and courtesy have evolved
<br>
for reasons that are not hard for me to see.  Therefore I
<br>
totally agree with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem with arguing for &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all attackers are sure they are being truthful and honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their attacks.  Even the 911 terrorists claimed truth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honesty and integrity for their actions.  Such a standard,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while theoretically sound, is almost never useful in practice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans always seem to be able to justify their actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their own minds such that they are the good guys.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  SWEIN?  8^D
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We deal with some difficult topics on this list, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I call on people to eschew heated argument in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; favor of controlled argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can &quot;call&quot; for this all you want, but it never happens.
</em><br>
<p>Well... sometimes it happens!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would this call be any different?  Seriously, do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you have just solved our problems?  If not, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a good solution to stopping flame wars.
</em><br>
<p>I dunno;  how about drawing and quartering?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think they are self-destructive behavior which nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants.  But we do not seem to want to stop them either.
</em><br>
<p>The alternative I propose is to learn to live with it.
<br>
Even better is this advice: just skip posts by people
<br>
who are engaging in flame wars.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ExI's best days are yet before of us.  Let us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cut down on rancor and fan the flames of progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are on the eve of construction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, but let's not just say it as a matter of faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's take real action.  What exact changes do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propose to make that will cut down on rancor?  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no changes are made, none will occur.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I propose no changes.  In fact, I don't even see
<br>
the need for any.  Moreover, I cannot even imagine any
<br>
that wouldn't make things worse.  But since you are so
<br>
interested in making changes, what do *you* propose?
