cleanly 
<br>
connected as some might like to imagine.

<p>Me: Definately have to say I agree; fundamentally I think its the

artificial

inflation of the US dollar versus other countries... Until that
<br>
equalizes,
<br>
pretty much the only way for us to remain dominant is either services
<br>
that
<br>
can't be out-sourced, straight out consumption [we control the major
<br>
market]
<br>
, or our &quot;patent&quot; portfolio as we sign more and more countries into the 
<br>
rope-a-dope strategy of the century [against under-developed countries].

<p><em>&gt; and certes, it doesn't

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I hope not too much of that.  :-)   Really, the one major resource you
<br>
have 
<br>
right now is time.  Please use it as wisely as you can.
<br>
<p>Me: HEHEHE :)  Don't worry about me :)  My current sticking point
<br>
for some basic projects is space; other more complex projects require
<br>
extensive preparation in applied science.  In any event, I've been
<br>
using my last year or two &quot;off&quot; too do a complete circuit in terms
<br>
of whats out currently out there :)  Further development requires
<br>
movement into the application phase which will be (finally) starting
<br>
august 15th or so with my move to California :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do have to say though, as a person who is extremely dedicated to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursuing his own ideas out to their logical conclusion, resources,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *particularly* people resources, are next to impossible to come by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [barring government/univ funding (where they get copyright/patent), or
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; being fabulously independently wealthy].  Plus, to do anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant, certain skills [which require a serious amount of effort 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and time to pickup] are currently beyond my ken.  Currently :)  But I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do remain optimistic, that given enough time on this planet [- sudden 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death or illness], I'll hit my critical point in a couple of years :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More than anything else though, its the lack of a skilled [and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedicated] labor supply (read: architects rather than technicians).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, I have yet to actually find a good (reliable) source 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for such [people] material.
</em><br>
<p>You need good technicians in greater abundance than architects.  But the
<br>
<p>architects are certainly crucial.   
<br>
<p>Me:  I prefer elegance than brute strength.
<br>
<p>Ergo, one of the MAJOR problems i have with a field such as (say)
<br>
medicine, is that alot more of it should be automated.  I've got
<br>
my out for such endeavors (stuff that fundamentally fixes broken
<br>
strategies in regards to what is currently termed &quot;treatment&quot;).
<br>
Of course, I'm predisposed to that route of parsing problems
<br>
because of my particular affinity to computers and search/signal
<br>
stuff :)
<br>
<p>One final point regarding technicians; I'ld rather have someone
<br>
focused, imaginative and perceptive rather than someone trained 
<br>
to do a set of tasks particularly well, particularly when you plan
<br>
on doing stuff that may or may not run counter to the current
<br>
intuitive mindset.  Ergo the classic difference of training
<br>
someone to do something urself as opposed to attempting to co-opt
<br>
a preexisting set of routines...
<br>
<p>On the plus side, I am slowly starting to penetrate into the
<br>
strata of older people, who, IMHO, are far more useful than
<br>
todays youth, both in regards to knowledge, people networks,
<br>
funding sources and keen intellect :)  I'm expecting the next
<br>
4-5 years to be particularly important as they will probably
<br>
found the next 10-15 years worth of private research.
<br>
<p>To be quite honest, the biggest problem I have with the
<br>
current framework of science (both applied and theoretical)
<br>
is that to do anything, you basically have to give your research
<br>
away.  Something I'm not willing to do, given the amount of
<br>
interesting technologies that are not allowed to progress
<br>
to fruitful conclusion due to either government or corporate
<br>
agendas.  If I can make a difference, I want it to be done
<br>
outside the current (imho, broken) system that seems
<br>
to govern my current environment, preferentially to be 
<br>
applied equally on a triage basis.
<br>
<p>Like I said earlier, in general, I'm optimistic :)
<br>
Barring sudden death, mutiliation or (fatal) diseases.
<br>
<p>Charlie Rose had a nobel laureate on TV, Wattson I think
<br>
(the guy who &quot;discovered&quot; DNA), and he pretty much said
<br>
the same thing :) Ergo alot of the problems  we currently suffer
<br>
from have a basis in our genetics, and that given a certain amount of
<br>
cash, the genetic basis could be determined via sequencing and
<br>
a good patient history.  To be DOUBLY honest, the largest
<br>
problem relating to such an endeavor, would not be the sequencing
<br>
(which require a certain amount of money X), but rather, a computeable
<br>
patient history sans border/language constraints.  The current system
<br>
(in place in the US), CPT codes and diagnostics, is insufficient both
<br>
in its granularity, and its ability to form a self-consistent 
<br>
knowledge base [e.g. computeable logic (knowledge base + 
<br>
inference engine)].
<br>
<p>I personally think all the money going into defense and politics should
<br>
be forcibly appropriated into the 21st century medical equivalent of 
<br>
Roosevelts(or whichever presdient did it) hiway program.  Something this
<br>
<p>important should not be left up to the whims of private development, 
<br>
especially considering the intellectual property rights nightmare it 
<br>
represents.
<br>
<p>I also think the US's notion of democracy is utterly broken, and needs
<br>
some serious voter reform.  Not to mention our (often terribly cruel)
<br>
foreign policy.  It really sucks that in this day and age, the concept
<br>
of nation-states is STILL not resolveable.  Mind you, I don't want
<br>
a homogenous world government, but rather, a general system which
<br>
supersedes cultural boundaries in areas which require it [beneficial
<br>
to humanity as a whole], but leaves a majority of the population 
<br>
with the ability to generate local settings as they see fit.
<br>
<p>I haven't even begun to think of how to reform the education system,
<br>
or rather, how to teach people effectively... I'm good with one-on-one
<br>
development, but multiple children/adults [simoultaneously] generally 
<br>
degrade my performance.
<br>
<p>A bit longer than I intended, but :) c'est la vie :)
