<p><em> &gt;Now, this is an interesting discussion. I often wonder how a movement so

small in absolute numbers &gt;can afford fragmentation, and whether

consolidating (joining forces) would make more sense. It is &gt;difficult to 
<br>
characterize differences between ExI and WTA without using politically 
<br>
overcharged words &gt;(which can upset some people).
<br>
<p>I cannot speak for Foresight or any other organization, however from ExI's 
<br>
stance, there is not a tendency to use politically overcharged words when 
<br>
referring to any other organization within the transhumanist 
<br>
community.  ExI has never  accused an organization of being politically 
<br>
incorrect.  There has been no need to due to a level of confidence ExI has 
<br>
exuded over the years.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Try this: A large part of the most vocal members of ExI tend to favor

spontaneous order over planning in social issues - A large &gt;part of the 
<br>
most vocal members of WTA tend to favor planning over spontaneous order in 
<br>
social issues.
<br>
<em> &gt;Here, I have said it without using politically overcharged words [right, 
</em><br>
left, libertarian, socialist, fascist, communist, anarchist, ...] &gt;but I am 
<br>
sure that some will still disagree with my (admittedly oversimplified) 
<br>
statement.
<br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;I, like many, am a member of both organizations and try, time allowing, 
</em><br>
to contribute to both. I appreciate the value of both views, &gt;and respect 
<br>
both, but the point I wish to make is: my experience first as a person, 
<br>
then as an engineer, then as a manager, tells &gt;me that the right thing is 
<br>
ALWAYS some kind of reasoned mix of spontaneous order and planning. Getting 
<br>
it right is an &gt;engineering, quantitative problem.
<br>
<em> &gt;I also think that &quot;pure&quot; positions at one or the other extreme are naive 
</em><br>
in the best case, very dangerous in the worst case.
<br>
<em> &gt;I wonder how many agree with this point of view. If many do, as I hope, 
</em><br>
then I do not see any fundamental problem if we wish to &gt;have more 
<br>
collaboration and less competition between ExI and WTA.
<br>
<p>Yes.  Since I'm for democracy, I think that our community needs to refrain 
<br>
from issuing labels onto people.  Please remember, ExI is not a competitive 
<br>
organization.  We have been here a long time and just keep doing what we 
<br>
do.  ExI has been supportive of new organizations and will continue to be, 
<br>
regardless of religious sentiment or political extremism, but this does not 
<br>
mean that we will advocate an organizations religious or political 
<br>
views.  Anyone competing with ExI is doing it on their own behalf and ExI 
<br>
does not have to participate.  All ExI has to do is continue striving for 
<br>
excellent and keep doing what it does best.
