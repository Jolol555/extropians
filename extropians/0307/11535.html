Um. Well said!
<br>
Although I try not to, I have to admit that I have a tendency to get a bit
<br>
upset when my ideas are challenged. I usually don't voice that emotion on
<br>
the list, but it is there and I can see how some people who have been here a
<br>
while would feel the need to.

<p><p><em>&gt; The perspective of an infrequent poster:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My reading of extropians has definitely fallen off seriously in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six months.  The bickering and sniping represents a large percentage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the volume of the list.  It becomes tedious to have to slog through it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out which discussions have content, and where that content is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've gotten a very good sense of which list members lie where on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the content-generation distribution, and I've killfiled a half-dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people--I've found that it's made the list much more readable.  But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do consider unsubscribing pretty frequently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a shame--the list is so full of bright, ambitious people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting and compelling visions of humanity's future, both near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and far.  But, as with every other online discussion forum I've ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participated in, the more intelligent and ambitious we get, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; childish, self-important and myopic we become when we feel our hard-won
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and excruciatingly-thought-out paradigms being queried or challenged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing that frequently strikes me about the list is the degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant certainty with which the list members state predictions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future.  Frankly, if anyone here could predict the future (or, hell,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the present) with any degree of precision, they wouldn't have time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sit around posting to this list, because they'd be spending every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waking moment _heavily_ involved in some other, extremely important works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, yeah, it's a serious problem, and I think you'd see a lot less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attrition if it weren't.
