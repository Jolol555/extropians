<p>
Eliezer and Randall dissent from my opinion.  Rebels, indeed.
<br>
<p>The first writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;     I didn't think this could be true, but it transpired this was not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     exceptional. 'Oh no,' says Kay. 'The record is actually held by a female.' On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     and off, she spent 18 months lying on her face.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...Isn't *this* pathological?  Doesn't it seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indicate that there really is something deeply,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deeply, serious wrong with this girl?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  It makes her a hero.  I would be proud to meet her.
</em><br>
<p>Though I am normally of kindly disposition, for once I 
<br>
would indeed hope that this befalls you and that moreover
<br>
you have to live with someone like that, just to know what
<br>
it is like.  (Here, I am *assuming* that she was of the
<br>
type, also described by Randy [not Randall], who has worked
<br>
with many children. The &quot;innocent&quot; ones are an easy case, and
<br>
we need not dwell on them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; How in the hell could she lay there hour after hour, day after day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without saying, &quot;Just how stupid could it be for me to have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; myself into this situation?  Exactly what was so important that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had to happen?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (This is not the same as a great martyr standing up for his God, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political dissident refusing to divulge the names of other dissidents.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It sounds just exactly the same to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Children are people.  Their parents don't believe it, but it's true.  For 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her to stand up for her rights is just as heroic, just as meaningful, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rosa Parks refusing to sit in the back of the bus.  Inconvenient, yes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painful, perhaps even breaking in the end, but heroic.
</em><br>
<p>It certainly *often* is the case. There will be nightmare families
<br>
into which some are born, and the regrettable to me asymmetry here
<br>
is that *we* as a society have no and must have no legal right to
<br>
interfere.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Consider also her alternatives.  This is a school designed to break 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children.  Nothing more, nothing less.  She cannot just &quot;go along&quot; with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system.  It is deliberately designed to reach into her soul, find her 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independence, and break it, to take every inch she gives it, and demand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more.
</em><br>
<p>What kind of person, pray tell me, is he or she that cannot
<br>
recognize a hopeless situation, and play ball?  Now if it
<br>
were a fair contest of wills, that might be different, but
<br>
after a few *days* don't you think that she would get the
<br>
picture?
<br>
<p>Here is a true disconnect: I, as a committed non-rebel, cannot
<br>
grok how when there is nothing important at stake, people can
<br>
be so stubborn?  When an abusive, arrogant, stupid cop pulls
<br>
me over in some case where obviously he's out for some entertainment,
<br>
I do not resist: I let him write his ticket, and say what needs to
<br>
be said to get myself out of the stupid situation.  But I do *not*
<br>
back down when principles are involved, as in a recent flare up on
<br>
this very list (in some situations, I do not seem to be able to
<br>
back down even when it would be prudent).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember also that these children are not adults and they do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have adult resources to resist; the people trying to destroy their souls 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are smarter and more experienced and have leisure to think and plan.  No, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she was quite wise to resist every step of the way for as long as she 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly could.
</em><br>
<p>Your two sentences seem in flagrant contradiction to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No one thinks much, on this list or elsewhere, of proposing that parents 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should have 24-hour surveillance capabilities over their children.  Why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not?  Children are valuable objects, aren't they?  Why shouldn't we be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to keep watch on them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you forgotten what a living hell that would have made your life when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were a child?  Are those memories so painful that they have simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been lost? ...But I remember.
</em><br>
<p>A &quot;living hell&quot;?  Pal, you don't know what you are talking
<br>
about. And no, it would not have made my life uncomfortable
<br>
if my parents were on the whole reasonable, no more than I
<br>
would feel awkward in a transparent society. Yes, it would
<br>
be frightful if my parents (or the government) was unreasonable,
<br>
and we have even found out, in the latter case, that they will
<br>
be unreasonable unless they are accountable too.
<br>
