</em><br>
<p>It is perhaps something I'm trying to figure out.
<br>
Reference my recent posts to Barbara with respect
<br>
to the various different &quot;codes&quot; (and some useful
<br>
comments on them from several people).
<br>
<p>I have a core belief that &quot;more complexity&quot; is better
<br>
than &quot;less complexity&quot;.  This may be modified by
<br>
&quot;more complexity sooner&quot; is better than &quot;less complexity
<br>
sooner&quot;.  That is because the Universe as we know it
<br>
and as currently structured might end and if one doesn't
<br>
get sufficient complexity to potentially intervene in
<br>
that process (sooner) then all bets are off.  (Viewed as
<br>
another way I'm concerned that we not only have to create an
<br>
extropic reality now, but we have to create an even
<br>
more extropic reality in the future, and we potentially
<br>
have to warp reality such that increasing extropicness
<br>
is feasible and can survive the current reality.
<br>
<p>This is driven in large part by Dyson's &quot;Time without
<br>
end&quot; perspective [1].  Alternate &quot;realities&quot; such as
<br>
Tipler's hold little attraction for me.  The entire
<br>
state of our comprehension of our universe *is* in
<br>
a significant state of flux at this time (due to
<br>
work in everything from dark energy to dark matter
<br>
to string theory) -- so exactly *how* the physics
<br>
of reality impacts on maximization of extropic
<br>
perspectives I do not now know.  But I *do* think
<br>
we should be thinking about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My problem is that 10^8 x 1 = 10^8, but 10^14 x (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of seconds remaining in the life of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe) x ***ZERO*** = ZERO.
</em><br>
<p>Point accepted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me, a potential life, a never-would-have-been-born-otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life gets a coefficient of actuality--and corresponding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coefficient of value--of zero.
</em><br>
<p>Here is where we may part in our opinions.  I view a
<br>
potential future human life as a &quot;it might save my lazy old
<br>
ass probability&quot;.  [This is well documented in terms of
<br>
the productivity of scientists younger than 30, not yet
<br>
married, etc.]  So one should not discount the value
<br>
of future human lives to zero (irrespective of the
<br>
discount rate one is otherwise using).  [For as I've
<br>
discussed if one loses humanity totally (leaving aside
<br>
oneself as an individual) then the discount rate one
<br>
selects doesn't really friggin matter -- so one had best
<br>
factor in some way to figure out how current vs. future
<br>
human lives may relate to ones long term survival.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you're born and living, you *count*.
</em><br>
<p>No argument.  But from an extropic perspective I have
<br>
to raise the question &quot;How much do you count&quot;?  Can
<br>
you climb out of bed on a day to day basis and answer
<br>
the question &quot;Yesterday, did I increase or decrease
<br>
the entropic trend in the universe?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Most members of humanity do not really have the opportunity to
<br>
ask that question unfortunately. Most members of this list
<br>
and certain people in power positions do.
<br>
<p>I *still* have not seen a clear and concise argument that
<br>
&quot;the needs of the many living&quot; outweigh &quot;the needs of the
<br>
many more future living&quot;.  I've seen arguments that those
<br>
living have a right of &quot;being&quot;.  Sorry, Nature doesn't
<br>
care about said &quot;right&quot; -- be it an earthquake, a volcano
<br>
or an asteroid they do not discriminate and they are
<br>
ruthless.  So the question becomes *what* one is doing
<br>
to reduce those risks (for either humanity or oneself)
<br>
or whether one has adopted a perspective of &quot;Live for now --
<br>
for it may all be over soon&quot; (which of course isn't a very
<br>
extropic perspective).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Woulda-coulda-shoulda been alive is nothing, zero, a fantasy.
</em><br>
<p>Not in my book -- those people may save my ass.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This in turn means that you're proposing killing ten million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for (what seems to others to be) nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Point taken.  If I accept that future lives are worth nothing
<br>
your argument holds.  But I do not -- particularly if the
<br>
elimination of humanity significantly devalues all current
<br>
human lives (what was the point of existing if nobody cares,
<br>
nobody remembers it, all of your history is erased, etc.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consequently, it's up to you to show that it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing, and that it rises to a level justifying the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shocking violence you ask us to consider.
</em><br>
<p>I have tried above (and in some previous messages).
<br>
In reflecting on it I realize that my suggestion of using
<br>
nuclear weapons was probably not justifiable due to the
<br>
fact they would likely cause an excessive amount of pain.
<br>
We probably have the technological means to eliminate
<br>
large numbers of individuals painlessly (one could think
<br>
of large scale administration of phenobarbital or something
<br>
similar).  [So the &quot;horror&quot; of nuclear weapons is removed
<br>
and one is just dealing mostly with the question of
<br>
&quot;Is the long term future of humanity better off with
<br>
these people alive or not alive?&quot; -- not too different
<br>
from the question that jurors in homicide cases deal
<br>
with though I'll admit the numbers are quite different.]
<br>
<p>And before everyone jumps off the cliff on me I do
<br>
realize the suggestion is horrible -- but I'm trying
<br>
to force one into the position of possible choices
<br>
between &quot;morality&quot; or &quot;humanity&quot;.
<br>
<p>I believe that it may be fundamental to extropic perspectives.
