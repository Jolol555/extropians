<em>&gt; &gt;You know, it's really like in a family. Someone says something, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the mother says: &quot;Don't say that!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I am sure it was common in the ancestral tribe, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;See how Damien recently reacted to a suggestion by Robert :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not anyone's mother. My capital letter bark at Robert when he raised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear genocide as a possible rational and *morally preferable* option
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; the revolted reaction of a friend who, out of politeness, did not wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say publicly what Eliezer said: `Are you autistic?'
</em><br>
<p>There's a lot of philosophizing, esoteric dialogue and parading one's
<br>
intellectual assets on this list, but sometimes the forest of people behind
<br>
the minutiae trees gets lost.  Anders, Damien, JeffDavis and Eliezer are
<br>
some of the strong winds  (and you thought they called the winds Mariah) who
<br>
have enough integrity, strength and courage to blow the bark off the
<br>
minutiae trees, at times, to reveal what is really in the woods: &quot;It's the
<br>
people, stupid.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is tricky, because I like Robert, he has been generous in his support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of me, I've learned a lot from his published papers, and any apt analogy I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might offer is bound to be offensive. But still, here's the analogy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; springs to mind: you're all sitting around in the bar, various groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversing or singing at various pitches of intimacy or boisterousness,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; someone known to the company comes in and starts spraying one wall, using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liquid excrement, with words such as HOW ABOUT LYNCHING ALL
</em><br>
THE ---------?.
<br>
<em>&gt; Do freedom-loving folks smile, grimace, shrug, and turn back to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drinks? Do they invite him over, still reeking, and begin a reasoned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion about how best to lynch all the -------, some judiciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising the alternative position that perhaps it might be preferable, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs and benefits taken into account, *not* to kill all the -------?
</em><br>
<p>I salute Damien's courage to express (and in such a caring way) what needed
<br>
to be said.  Many people seem to confuse respecting one's right to free
<br>
speech and to hold certain views with respecting (necessarily) those views.
<br>
If the Emperor has no clothes (and looks to be missing some other major
<br>
assets), we should not be afraid to say it.   In fact, it's our duty ...
