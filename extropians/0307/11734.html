Hubert had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In some extreme cases I guess it is appropriate to attack someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personally, so she or he gets a chance to reevaluate his/her thoughts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whenever it comes to the support of killing people for any cause whatsoever,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; except for self defense I think I even have the obligation for a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attack.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are being stupid.
<br>
<p>It never accomplishes anything whatsoever to engage in personal
<br>
attacks.  At least it doesn't with people of any individuality
<br>
or who have any backbone at all.  Not only that, but it has
<br>
nearly zero information content.  Look at my opening blast above.
<br>
What does it convey except my own state of mind, and my own silly
<br>
intolerance?
<br>
<p>I can agree that if we were all in a control room aboard an atomic
<br>
satellite circling the Earth, and Robert said, &quot;Let's just destroy
<br>
North Korea---it would take only about 300 H-bombs&quot;, then perhaps
<br>
one probably should not suppress one's emotional reaction.  But
<br>
that's because Robert may be standing too near the button, and one
<br>
needs to get his attention (like he says below).  But for God's
<br>
sake THIS IS A DISCUSSION.  If I want to BLOW UP THE WHOLE WORLD
<br>
BECAUSE i THINK THAT SUFFERING IS BAD AND HAPPINESS IS HARDLY
<br>
ANY GOOD AT ALL, THEN IT IS POINTLESS FOR EVERYONE TO JUST GET
<br>
EMOTIONAL AT ME.
<br>
<p>Sorry.  (I hope that my mixed irony/loss of self control is not
<br>
without its entertaining aspects.)
<br>
<p>Robert writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this case I would have to side with Hubert
</em><br>
<p>Traitor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- there are extreme cases where one has to whack someone in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the side of the head to get them to &quot;reevaluate his/her thoughts&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (myself included).
</em><br>
<p>Not in a *rational* email discussion.  I have too much respect
<br>
for you to suppose that I cannot get your attention through
<br>
logical and rational argumentation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When Robert Bradbury made his sick nuking proposal the other day, he did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; express a monstrous, ultimate example of the ugliness of utilitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy, moral depravity and mega-fascism: wiping out a huge group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans for his beloved fetish, called technological advance.
</em><br>
<p>You see, Hubert, there is a fascist threat implicit in your
<br>
language.  You know what we do to sick people, don't you?
<br>
We round them up and ultimately send them to clinics, or,
<br>
in more blunt language, re-education centers, or cutting to
<br>
the chase: the gulag.  If you can just get ENOUGH people to
<br>
agree with you that certain thoughts and actions are *sick*,
<br>
then you are well on your way to enforcing thought conformity.
<br>
Don't these tendencies within you scare you at all?
<br>
<p>I appeal to your rational mind, and what I hope is your love
<br>
of free expression.  Name calling and personal attacks are
<br>
ultimately a threat---when it comes right down to it---a form
<br>
of textual aggression that bypasses the rational parts of our
<br>
minds and strikes fear into our primate centers.  Get unpopular
<br>
enough and... well, you know..., the midnight knock on the door
<br>
will be coming.
<br>
<p>In skeptics like me, moreover, the very fact that you resort to
<br>
calling Robert's proposal &quot;sick&quot; provides a strong hint that not
<br>
only would you prefer (in some deep dark recess of your mind) to
<br>
use force to silence or control others, but that you happen to
<br>
lack objective, rational, and logical arguments against the 
<br>
proposal itself!
<br>
<p>Robert bows once again:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yep, I'll plead guilty, on some days I'm a hard-core extropian --
</em><br>
<p>Weak-kneed traitor and sycophant.
<br>
<p>But finally Robert now resorts to Extropian, rational discourse:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i.e. we either advance civilization as fast as we possibly can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (complexification) or we might as well write it all off now as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a pointless exercise (odds are given our current understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics we all end up dead anyway)
</em><br>
<p>Either/or?  Sounds like a semantic error to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- so all you are arguing for is the extension of an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futile existence for billions of people who happen to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have &quot;free will&quot; (realizing of course that their experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;pleasure&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;free will&quot;, etc. has been dictated by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random set evolutionary accidents.
</em><br>
<p>Futile existence?  Sorry, I missed a segue here.  But anyway,
<br>
maybe you need to read Dennett's new book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot;.
<br>
Futility is in the eye of the beholder, whereas there happens
<br>
to be NO conflict between free will and determinism.  Of course
<br>
I am the product of accidents of evolution, but happy day---here
<br>
I am!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolution doesn't care whether humanity survives or becomes extinct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are going to propose that we should &quot;care&quot; about humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you need to explain what parts of it we should save and why.
</em><br>
<p>We need to save ourselves (and the rest of the universe from
<br>
remaining dead like it is now) because that would be enjoyable,
<br>
provide satisfaction, fulfillment, and meaning.  (Given adequate
<br>
technology, it will be easy to wire our brains to experience
<br>
those and even more that we cannot even now imagine!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With regard to functioning as a fill-in for &quot;Hitler, Goering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Goebbels&quot; you will have a hard time making such labels stick.
</em><br>
<p>Attaboy!  You tell him, Robert!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reasons for this are as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) I have no agenda of my own to push (the only agenda I am looking at is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the extropian agenda which I view as a possible path for the maximization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of the longevity of intelligence in the universe);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) I don't strongly care if I survive.
</em><br>
<p>I do not disapprove of your (a), that is your choice.
<br>
<p>As for (b), your brain is simply not working quite
<br>
right (as you know vastly, vastly better than I).
<br>
You logically should care very much that you survive
<br>
because untold gratification, ecstasy, fulfillment,
<br>
joy, satisfaction, contentment, varishing, skrenning,
<br>
and vastening are just around the corner.  (The last
<br>
three taken from Henry Kuttner's &quot;The Proud Robot&quot;,
<br>
wherein the robot experiences things as yet unknown
<br>
to humans.) (The &quot;vastening&quot; has an entirely
<br>
different meaning than the transhumanist usage.)
<br>
<p>So however you currently feel (and I'm with you---often
<br>
my life is no bed of roses), logically one must admit
<br>
the very real possibility of future bonanza.
<br>
<p>Logic grabs you by the throat and FORCES you to acknowledge
<br>
that immesurably vast upcoming gratification is a possibility.
<br>
And even if there were only a one-percent chance of getting
<br>
there, you MUST logically appreciate it!  You MUST repeat
<br>
these truths all the time, regardless of how one feels.
<br>
<p>Lee
