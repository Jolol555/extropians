<p><em>&gt; Not at all. If you wish to express it in these terms, then the question I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was getting at is: &quot;What is the price of the ABSENCE of a moral code?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Point taken.  I might offer that perhaps there are 3 codes --
<br>
a legal code, a moral code and an instinctual code.
<br>
<p>The instinctual code seems dependent on our genetic makeup
<br>
(currently fixed -- but likely not for long).  The moral
<br>
code seems highly society dependent (witness &quot;eye for an eye&quot;
<br>
behaviors in Iraq or Turkey which have been the discussion
<br>
of recent news articles).  The legal code seems quite
<br>
bendable [at least over time] (witness the recent PBS
<br>
specials documenting how the wives of Henry VIII were
<br>
manipulated using varieties of court/church/political
<br>
&quot;law&quot; all the way up to the the Japanese internment
<br>
during WWII -- &quot;The Fred Korematsu Story&quot; and how
<br>
the Supreme Court was manipulated by the Justice Dept.
<br>
to produce a verdict that still seems to hang over our
<br>
heads).
<br>
<p>Against those 3 codes -- I would still offer up the questions of:
<br>
-- (a) Are the rules of the code(s) worth the sacrifice of those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who would uphold it (or believe in it) [or benefit from it]?
<br>
-- (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, then the question would seem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to become &quot;How many current lives -- and how many future lives --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are you willing to sacrifice for such principle(s)?&quot;
<br>
<p>Note that I'm attempting to force one into a position of doing
<br>
triage (what lives do I allow to be lost now?) as well as performing
<br>
a discount value analysis of the net worth of current vs. future
<br>
human lives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although there is usually quite a bit of overlap, a legal code and a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code are not identical.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  I think I have provided examples why this perspective may
<br>
be so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This seems to be a different argument from the one you were making earlier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather than saying that it's okay to disregard one's moral code, you now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be arguing that a practical moral code should be in part based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the assumption that the needs of many outweigh the needs of the few, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I am more interested in precisely *when* one code grants
<br>
precedence or priority to another.  Or I may be interested in how
<br>
one structures the codes for the most extropic outcome.  It is
<br>
probably reasonable to assume that I desire the most extropic
<br>
future.  This would seem in line with my actions over the last
<br>
decade, my position on the ExI board, and at least some of my
<br>
postings to the list).
<br>
<p>Now, if an extropic future path is in conflict with current
<br>
legal, moral or instinctual codes then I think we need to
<br>
seriously look at those codes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Apparently in your scenario, the decision maker is whoever has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most potent weapons.
</em><br>
<p>This would appear to be true.  However the decision maker can
<br>
choose *not* to exercise that power.  In which case the power
<br>
migrates to those with less potent weapons.  I'd suggest a
<br>
review of the battles between the British Navy and the German
<br>
Navy during WWII, esp. the history of the Bismark.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But while I do not agree with the moral code you are suggesting, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly feel more comfortable dealing with you if I thought you adhered to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOME moral code rather than just acted on whatever course of action seemed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you at the moment to be expedient.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Expedient&quot; may be pushing it a bit.  I believe that I subscribe to
<br>
an &quot;extropic&quot; moral code and am seeking a path where that fits into
<br>
other codes.  In particular -- in previous suggestions I was looking
<br>
at the distinction between a one time cost of 10^8 human lives
<br>
vs. 10^14 human lives *per second*.  Few, if any, individuals
<br>
seem to have picked up on the magnitude of the problem I
<br>
was raising.  Let me reformulate it -- one can sacrifice
<br>
100 million (10^8) human lives (one time) *or* one can
<br>
sacrifice 10,000+ potential humanities (i.e. ~10 billion
<br>
people) *every second* that you choose not to sacrifice
<br>
those 100 million lives.
<br>
<p>Let me make it clear again -- *every* second you choose not
<br>
to pursue the the most extropic development path you are
<br>
sacrificing 10,000 potential humanities.
<br>
<p>And I have not seen one discounted present value analysis
<br>
of the lives lost [because we wish to maintain current
<br>
legal or moral codes]  (and this leaves out what the value of
<br>
those lives from an extropic perspective which may be quite
<br>
different).
<br>
<p>And Barbara -- you cannot escape from the &quot;value of human life&quot;
<br>
analysis as our legal &quot;code&quot; regularly deals with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your suggestion of mass murder to save humanity is qualitatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to spiking your drinking water with arsenic to kill bacteria.
</em><br>
<p>First, my thoughts were motivated to save *many* humanities.
<br>
Second, I do not understand the comparison -- I am proposing
<br>
that some may need to die so that many many more others may live.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, the fate of the Donner Party is a fascinating tale, but if you're using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to somehow justify your position, I think you need to explain further.
</em><br>
<p>It was a point to show how the &quot;moral code&quot; (I.e. thou shalt not eat
<br>
other humans) was on a slippery slope.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is your answer to this question therefore that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be repulsed by situations in which the moral code gets discarded?
</em><br>
<p>I personally would not be repulsed by situations in which the legal
<br>
or moral codes get discarded for the instinctual (survival) code.
<br>
I might not like them, particularly if I were on the down side
<br>
of the decisions (say serving as food for the Donner party).
<br>
But I would understand the necessity of the actions.
<br>
<p>Robert
