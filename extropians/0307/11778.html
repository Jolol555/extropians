</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not following you.  However, perhaps you mean:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The answer might be, 'Intelligent enough to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; workable ethics.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, what's the matter with *our* ethics, that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human ethics?  IMO there are very few really evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  I have never met anyone who I think would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not make a good God.  (Yes, some people would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than others, but no one I have ever met would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dish out disaster and hardship the way old Jehovah
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The vast majority of humans are not &quot;evil&quot; by the standards of the vast 
<br>
majority of humans.  However, this does not mean that their ethics is ok and 
<br>
certainly does not mean that it will work perfectly well as we get greater 
<br>
abilities for good or harm.  Most people are not particularly compassionate 
<br>
and believe that acheiving their interests can be done at the expense of 
<br>
others and this is perfectly ok as long as one can get away with it.  I have 
<br>
seen on this very list talk about how the first uploads or AIs shoud/would 
<br>
preclude others from becoming as powerful.  In short, the old 
<br>
reptilian/mammal/primate power dominance extended straight into godhood. This 
<br>
assumptions have been made on many, many levels on this very list.   Too few 
<br>
point out that these sort of &quot;reasonable ethics&quot; played at higher levels of 
<br>
power could result in wars, suppression and oppression at a horrific scale 
<br>
not yet fully imagined.    
<br>
<p>I find the notion that the average Joe or Jill elevate to God powers would do 
<br>
just fine to be one of the most deeply troublesome statements I have ever 
<br>
encountered here.  With great power goes great responsibility.  With great 
<br>
power goes great need for wisdom. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But simple intellectual talent does not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bring a more peaceable world. Or have I missed your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point, completely?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given that there exist states of matter so advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a few cubic centimeters of it could emulate our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire civilization sans the really unpleasant stuff,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why not convert the whole solar system to that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You mean besides the likelihood that the entire solar system is being run 
<br>
within something like that?  :-)   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be a crime in my book to leave any matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever out of that equation---and that certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes mindless trees and insects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, presumably you include all humans who do not choose to be uploaded in the 
<br>
category of &quot;wasted&quot; matter that should be converted anyway?   If uploading 
<br>
of humans turns out to be infeasible will you happily die?
