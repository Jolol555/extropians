<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;   1. when should government print money

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When it needs more new money, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How perfectly awful of you to say that!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't know much about this printing of money business.  I hear it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; devalues the currency ... which might be good if your currency is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and obviously bad if your currency is weak.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Printing more money definitely devalues the currency,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, by itself, is quite destructive.  It's an implicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheat against anyone holding the money, and punishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially the prudent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But when an economy really is expanding---due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very miracle I like to discuss---then the printers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whip up some more money and lend it to the banks, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lend it to their customers.  (And in times of contraction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this same money vanishes in the exact reverse process.)
</em><br>
<p>Most money today is not printed. Most money is in electronic form,
<br>
numbers on a balance sheet in the fractional reserve system. Only a
<br>
small fraction of the money supply is actually printed Federal Reserve
<br>
Notes. The Fed decides, via instruments like the reserve ratio and
<br>
short term interest rates, how to regulate the money supply. The money
<br>
supply is supposed to reflect the value of the economy as a whole, a
<br>
large part of which relies on what is called the velocity of money,
<br>
i.e. how quickly money changes hands. An economy where a dollar changes
<br>
hands three times a day is three times bigger than one where the same
<br>
dollar only changes hands once a day.
<br>
<p>When consumer sentiment (since most of the economy is based on
<br>
consumption) gets insecure and fearful, the velocity of money decreases
<br>
and the money supply therefore contracts. The fed can try to compensate
<br>
for this by making the cost of money less (reducing interest rates) and
<br>
reducing the reserve rate, i.e. the fraction of money that banks must
<br>
keep in reserve. If they have to keep a smaller fraction in reserve,
<br>
they can lend a proportionately larger multiple out in loans. When
<br>
consumer sentiment surges upward, the fed can do the reverse to
<br>
constrain any 'irrational exhuberance'.
<br>
<p>I've recently run into an organization called NORFED that issues money
<br>
based on a silver standard and which is pretty widely accepted in some
<br>
parts of the US (Mostly agricultural areas, which will be understood
<br>
later). These people want to do away with the federal reserve system
<br>
and restore the use of a metal based currency. It is essentially a
<br>
populist agricultural movement, as indicated by its favor of a silver
<br>
standard, because back when we used gold and silver money, the farmers
<br>
got wealthier when silver was favored by exchange rates, and got poorer
<br>
when gold was favored (good gold rates made the bankers wealthier). You
<br>
might recall William Jennings Bryan's presidential election speech
<br>
where he famously said,&quot;You shall not crucify man on a cross of gold.&quot;
<br>
<p>Metal based currencies are fine for nations which are predominantly
<br>
agriculturally based. When your wealth is tied up in crops and herds
<br>
that can be wiped out by weather and disease, in land whose topsoil can
<br>
be blown away by wind and flood, it is of paramount importance to keep
<br>
your savings in assets that are tangible and not easily destroyed, and
<br>
don't have much consumptive value beyond this. Gold and silver have no
<br>
technological use in an agricultural economy. Their value is only in
<br>
their scarcity and permanance.
<br>
<p>However, when you have a broad, technologically based economy, metals
<br>
become consumed commodities, while the value of the economy is invested
<br>
in the means of production which are not so easily destroyed:
<br>
factories, tools, machines, roads, bridges, rail lines, communications
<br>
networks, computers, software, and knowledge. In such an economy,
<br>
basing your money supply entirely on one or two very narrow commodities
<br>
is the height of folly. Better to base your money on the value of the
<br>
entirety of that economy. This is what the fractional reserve system
<br>
does, because most assets are mortgaged in some way, in either public
<br>
or private debt, to a banking institution somewhere in the country. 
<br>
<p>The mortgaged assets are the real 'reserve'. The economic activity they
<br>
produce is the real money supply. The Federal reserve is all of the
<br>
assets of the federal government: its buildings, bases, and lands. The
<br>
gold in Fort Knox is a very minor asset in the whole panoply of federal
<br>
assets. Most of the federal governments assets are the land it owns 'in
<br>
trust': national parks and forests, BLM and Interior controlled lands.
<br>
When the federal reserve issues loans of 'money' to banks, or when it
<br>
prints money up, it is using these federal assets as collateral.
