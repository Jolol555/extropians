<em>&gt; Subject: Extropian Productivity (was RE: flame wars)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There has been more chatter on this list about thread titles and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion names then there has been on a real effort to pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological progression.  I would add to this comment the complaint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a lot of the discussions that take place are not important, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important discussion often are reacted to negatively.  
</em><br>
<p>What the hell, is everybody subscribed to this list in
<br>
digest mode except me, and moreover have not heard about
<br>
the unique wonders of the page-down key?
<br>
<p>Since I've already made this point numerous times, I'll
<br>
try a different approach:  think of all the idiotic and
<br>
pointless (TO YOU!) threads as broadening the audience
<br>
for *your* posts too!  Clearly if so many people are 
<br>
engaged in so many discussions, just think about how
<br>
many *must be* reading your own idiotic and pointless
<br>
posts!    ;-)    (Just kidding---I like your posts.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok..., let's talk more about brains the size of Jupiter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we would ask god if we came across him, because these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are important.
</em><br>
<p>You and I may enjoy such telelogically arcane discussions,
<br>
but as some have made clear recently, it's not everyone's
<br>
cup of tea.  You'd *really* have a hard case proving that
<br>
talk of Jupiter brains was as important, as, say, containing
<br>
AIDS or liberals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Previous to that, a thread developed talking about cloning the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent people in the world and raising the children in science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly environments, receiving many replies and much discussion.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested instead that Extropians just adopt any of the thousands of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information craved children out there with no good homes and start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising some extropian kids.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0 replies.  Not even a 'wow, good idea'  (perhaps it just wasn't as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well)
</em><br>
<p>Or maybe no one objected.  Whenever I get 0 replies, I always
<br>
infer that at least one thing is now settled, and that everyone
<br>
agrees with me.  Maybe you have a self-esteem problem?   ;-)
<br>
<p>(Just being comical, of course.  The point of my irony
<br>
is that with so much to read every day, it's no wonder
<br>
than many of one's posts are ignored.  And as for &quot;self
<br>
esteem&quot; problem, the joke here is for someone to
<br>
think that his views are unanimously agreed to by the
<br>
1000+ people reading this list---even though, in addition,
<br>
it definitely is true that many people including me just
<br>
silently pass over that with which we agree.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Additionally, just recently, I lamented that the banning of DDT causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some 2 - 4million deaths annually and that since its ban it has caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly 60 million deaths, putting one Rachel Carson as the top mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderer of all time if you consider people to be morally culpable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their opinions being believed.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good point.  But there are at least three kinds of mass murderers:
<br>
<p>Category 1:  Hitler, Stalin, and Pot Pol, who deliberately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;singled out entire of classes of people to exterminate
<br>
<p>Category 2:  Mao Ze Dong, whose inexcusable tyrannical policies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killed 30 million people.  Now even though he never planned
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for that consequence---unlike the category 1 mass
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;murderer---he didn't really give a damn that it happened.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(See his biographer.)
<br>
<p>Category 3:  Rachel Carson and Franklin Roosevelt, whose suggestions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and blind policies lead to the deaths of tens of millions,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they (innocently) simply didn't understand the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reality in which they were living.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can we do something about the DDT ban?
</em><br>
<p>Who is we?  Actually, what's left of my weekend is booked up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extropians like to talk to talk, but not walk the walk.
</em><br>
<p>Each to his own, I say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I said, the deep value I find in the Extropy list is that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps the largest collection of intelligent people I have yet found on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a single list, and I have learned much from it, both refining my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas, learning new ones, and hopefully helping to refine others ideas.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, but that's not good enough now, is it?  You and
<br>
Harvey (and I hope not Natasha) need to *reform*
<br>
everything, right?  Alas, people like me usually end
<br>
up being the reformee, which all the activists get to
<br>
be the reformers, that lack the mental circuitry to
<br>
imagine the possibility that sometimes good things 
<br>
should be left alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Something about the Extropy list as it is tends to keep trolls and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annoying posters who can contribute little intellectually to any of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away, and I do not feel it is really necessary to start listing more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules and enforcing them, for example, subject line policies.  Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things really *that* bad?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, okay.  I apologize.  You're not one of the wreckers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't worry, I do not suggest that ExI as a group make any official
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement toward accomplishing something productive, instead I call upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals to do whatever they can to bring about extropian ideals.
</em><br>
<p>Hooray!  I guess you and Spike will just never make good Social Planners.
<br>
<p>Lee, over and out.
