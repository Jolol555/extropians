Just as a side note; even if you could scan the brain in the method you
<br>
describe,
<br>
you would be no closer to remotely understanding it;  the brain is more
<br>
than just
<br>
synaptic electro-chemical processing; alot of the processing occurs is
<br>
not intracellular,
<br>
its inter-cellular... ergo identical neurotransmitters can instigate
<br>
different cellular
<br>
responses based on a cell-specific (sub-cellular) response.. if you
<br>
included direct
<br>
replication of your structure (your atomic scan), of the entire body,
<br>
and not just the
<br>
brain, then of course, the point is moot :)  But as I said, IF you
<br>
decide to include
<br>
direct replication of the brain...
<br>
<p>and if thats the case, why bother freezing the meat, if you can freeze
<br>
the signal...
<br>
<p>in any event, that level of technology is so distant, I wouldn't even
<br>
begin to hazard
<br>
a timeline :) 
<br>
<p>And to directly address your question (heisenberg uncertainty as it
<br>
relates
<br>
to a nondestructive, atomic-level scan), not to my knowledge....
<br>
although I
<br>
heard rumors 5 years or so ago about a passive (rather than active) scan
<br>
which would allow you to technically sidestep heisenbergs principle...
<br>
sadly (for you and me both), I have absolutely no references on this;
<br>
and given the importance associated with such an event, coupled with the
<br>
complete lack of fanfair, doubt that it even exists, except perhaps as
<br>
a theoretical construct or an exception that proves the rule...
<br>
<p>of course, all this is from an educated lay-mans perspective, discussing
<br>
various prospects with experts :)  I have yet to track down a physicist
<br>
though and engage in a discussion on quantum dynamics/mechanics since
<br>
I would be at best, woefully unprepared for such a discussion...
<br>
<p>maybe in a couple of years when I read up a bit on subatomic stuff :)
<br>
<p>I did have an interesting discussion with somebody on a tangential
<br>
topic;
<br>
its my firm belief (note, belief), that it would be more beneficial to
<br>
work
<br>
on the brain in a sub-cellular viewpoint, rather than an organization of
<br>
<p>differentiated cell-neurons and the like...  of course the latter
<br>
viewpoint 
<br>
is the more predominantly pursued of the two...
<br>
<p>omard-out

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  information is in global patterns or local patterns, whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information makes a distinction in the final molecular state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if the apparent functional characteristics of the neuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  have been destroyed).
</em><br>
<p>What it the state of the art currently in scanning? Its been my
<br>
impression that the atomic level granularity of a scan that I 
<br>
imagine to be necessary can only be done by destroying each layer in
<br>
reading it. Is this the case currently?
<br>
<p>Obviously if each layer could be read in slices of a few Angstrom
<br>
without destroying the brain tissue itself you could run mulitple parses
<br>
from multiple directions.
<br>
<p>It would seem to be a relatively simple exercise to drop a sheeps brain
<br>
(comparable in size to the human brain into liquid
<br>
nitrogen) and then see what sort of freezing damage arises givin an
<br>
indication as to whether the information can be 
<br>
extracted once we have something approaching the scanning technology
<br>
required. Obviously the data storage requirements are going to be a
<br>
challenge could we now scan non destructively say any 5 millimetre cube
<br>
within a frozen sheep brain and 
<br>
store the data?
