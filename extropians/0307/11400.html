<em>&gt;&gt;Deutsch also links to an organization, Taking Children Seriously,

<em>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/</a>, dedicated to the principle that &quot;it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;possible and desirable to bring up children entirely without doing things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to them against their will, or making them do things against their will,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and that they are entitled to the same rights, respect and control over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;their lives as adults.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I found this site quite interesting. I was surprised at the degree to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which they are able to use a Popperian approach to conclude that popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dogmas about children are cruel.
</em><br>
<p><p>The person behind this organisation (Sarah Fitz-Claridge) has a link to her
<br>
own personal website from the TCS site. She's got quite a lot about
<br>
extropianism (cryonics etc), or did the last time I looked which wasn't that
<br>
long ago. She and  Frances Kendall (a South African libertarian) are the
<br>
only people who have really tried to think about a libertarian approach to
<br>
children and child-rearing in recent times. You'll notice the strong
<br>
influence, besides Popper, of Godwin. He's an interesting philosopher who
<br>
doesn't get a lot of coverage these days - he's best known as Shelley's
<br>
father-in-law!
