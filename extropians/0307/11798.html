<p><em>&gt; I agree with Damien about the value of Bryan's posts. Thank you for coming

</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed -- optimism and humility. You said : &lt;&lt;One of the general points
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm trying to make here is that we need to foster a sense of humility.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  I think the latter quote may be Harvey's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would slightly rephrase what you said about optimism, Bryan to this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Optimism should be the *inspiration* to work harder for the future, not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excuse to sit back and do nothing. Every entrepreneur I've ever met has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been wildly optimistic. One of my functions as a lawyer/CPA is to spill a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little rain on my clients' optimism, to the extent of pointing out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible weaknesses in their plans possible rough spots they could run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into. This may be the sort of thing you mean when you say we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foster a sense of humility; but being aware of potential problems is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing as being humble.
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;humility&quot; I mean the acceptance of a certain pluralism; that is, don't
<br>
assume your goals are (or should be) universal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would go so far as to say that too much humility is more likely to cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inaction than too much pride. A humble person is more likely to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitude that nothing she does can make any difference. Rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humility, I think we need to foster a sense of reality-based pride in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishment and belief in every person's ability to make changes for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the better. Such changes can't all be listed on a general to-do list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (although such a list probably wouldn't be a bad idea), because many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the changes are personal in nature. I liked something Anders said well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to repeat it here: &lt;&lt;As I see it the question &quot;how can I get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved?&quot; can be turned into the question-tree: &quot;Can I turn my current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities and interests into something more useful? If not, do I want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change them in such a  direction?&quot;. Most people are going to find that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first step actually gives plenty of room for practical action.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The larger issue is the question of the status of futurism and the
<br>
opposition of futurism (positing a future that we then work towards in
<br>
order to find resolve/meaning) to a more immediate, situated activism (which
<br>
I describe as, &quot;an extropianism concerned with fidelity to those particular
<br>
truths science has revealed about ourselves and our world and how they
<br>
interact with our current situation [and culture]&quot;).  It's quite a radical
<br>
thesis, and I'm not sure I explained it as well as I could.  In simple
<br>
terms: (1) I identify a problem with our futurism (the future we posit takes
<br>
the form of its own fulfilment [in the &quot;ultratechnologies&quot;]); (2) I try to
<br>
show how this is exactly so (this is admittedly the weakest part of my
<br>
thesis; I begin with the claim that futurism entails a certain overarching
<br>
monism and argue for a more active, pluralistic philosophy, but don't have a
<br>
systematic account of how the sort of eschatological &quot;self-fulfilment&quot; I
<br>
initially speak of comes about); and (3) I try to formulate a sort of
<br>
anti-futurism, a philosophy that doesn't posit an exacting future, but
<br>
contains all the positive aspects of extropianism.  I suggest &quot;humility,&quot; in
<br>
the sense I describe above, as a kind of interim solution.
<br>
<p>In this sense, I don't think my suggestions are at odds with optimism or
<br>
pride.  The kind of humility I want to encourage is the kind that situates
<br>
us within a horizon in which action can take place, a more human scale.
