<em>&gt; ### What if you keep removing your brain piece by piece - first the

<em>&gt; parietal cortex (losing the sense of space and location in 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefrontal and parietal language cortex (losing the stream of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; olfactory cortex (losing the imagination of smell), then the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insula (losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sense of your body), then..., well, would there be anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left? Even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you still have your motor cortex, your prefrontal executive areas, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hippocampi and basal ganglia, even the moral reasoning cortex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the frontal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pole, would there be anything subjectively existent?
</em><br>
No idea. But it is crucial to my argument above that I agree that all
<br>
functions of intelligence seem to be fulfilled (or fulfillable at least) by
<br>
non-concious mundane algorithms, implemented in wetware or other physical
<br>
substrates. This is my quandry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I rather think that &quot;I&quot; is a side effect of certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information flows, maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even atemporal states of mathematical entities. 
</em><br>
<p>I think Egan postulated something like this in Permutation City... we are
<br>
arrangements of information, and the permutations on the way you interpret
<br>
physical entities to be arranged are infinite, therefore everything
<br>
internally consistent exists somewhere as a complex mapping from some piece
<br>
of reality to the target pattern (although I think the mapping would often
<br>
require more information than the target pattern embodies).
<br>
<p>But if you believe this, then identity really disappears in a puff of logic.
<br>
Why would we even bother with this reality if we always exist in the greater
<br>
platonic pattern space?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular flavor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I-ness depends on the particulars of our brains, but as long 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information processing of some level of complexity, there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience. 
</em><br>
<p>How does it tie together? Consciousness doesn't arise from data, it is
<br>
postulated that it arise from iterative process. But processing is so
<br>
arbitrary; you can just about map any process to any other with a complex
<br>
enough mapping procedure. Where does the concrete individual come from?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Jeff wrote, something exists, and this is all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can be sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of, assuming that nobody asks exactly what is something as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything or nothing, and what it means to exist, or not to exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal
</em><br>
<p>I'm still stuck on &quot;I exist&quot; =&gt; &quot;Something exists&quot; =&gt; &quot;I don't exist&quot; =&gt;
<br>
&quot;Nothing exists&quot;. Ack.
