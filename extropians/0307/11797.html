<p>I should distinguish the general idea of computation, that will be widely
<br>
applied, from the &quot;cultural artifact&quot; of the computer, be it the mainframe,
<br>
personal computer, supercomputer.  It's the latter that I think has had its
<br>
day.  For example, computers may play some role in neuroprosthesis, but the
<br>
idea of a brain-machine interface beyond a prosthetic role or beyond a
<br>
simple interface (i.e., &quot;mind control&quot; of existing interfaces), is unlikely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you suggesting Artificial Intelligence is impossible?
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm suggesting that the philosophical argument, the question of whether
<br>
computers are capable of genuine thought, is no basis for a research
<br>
programme.  (To be honest, I don't think it's even really interesting as
<br>
philosophy.)  If you want to create a brain, study the brain.  The idea that
<br>
we can simply sit down and program &quot;thought&quot; is absurd.

</em><br>
<p>This is a difficult issue.  My partial solution is to argue that death, as
<br>
an event, is culturally determined, and to ask that our view be given as
<br>
much consideration as the &quot;death is inevitable/desirable&quot; view, under the
<br>
auspice of the prevailing pluralism in society.  Avoiding senescence would
<br>
be a choice and a choice that casts itself as somewhat arbitrary, rather
<br>
than a goal we apply to all humanity (the &quot;millions of lives will be lost
<br>
unless we cure aging&quot; mentality).  This requires two things: (1) greater
<br>
understanding of what I just described as the &quot;death is
<br>
inevitable/desirable&quot; view; and (2) a more detailed account of our own
<br>
position and how it relates to the prevailing cultural situation.  The
<br>
tricky part is how to inaugerate our &quot;sub-culture&quot; without appearing
<br>
arrogant; jettisoning the (mock) horror and confusion we feel at the idea
<br>
that some people want to die is only the start.  My own hope is that the
<br>
tension between wanting to get the word out, to secure funding, etc, and
<br>
wanting a morally defensible exclusionary practise (so we don't just seem
<br>
like a bunch of arrogant Westerners who want to live forever while half the
<br>
world is starving) will be alleviated simply by elucidating our position.
<br>
My feeling is that our goals here aren't a simple product of hubris.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The telephone is inanimate.
</em><br>
<p>A book is inanimate.  Yet it embodies the ideology of its author, its time,
<br>
its culture.  Of course, the book is a particular kind of artifact designed
<br>
to communicate, but I doubt anyone now thinks a book communicates only that
<br>
which it was specifically designed to communicate.  It's a reasonable
<br>
extension to suggest a technology, designed with a particular function in
<br>
mind, brings with it certain other &quot;functions&quot; reflective of the time and
<br>
place of its inception.  Usually these cultural biases are ascribed, in
<br>
technology, through certain notions of efficiency and optimality.  When a
<br>
technology is transplanted from one culture to another, the result is far
<br>
more complicated than a simple &quot;progress.&quot;  (We can accept this while
<br>
rejecting the stronger thesis that there is no such thing as progress.)
