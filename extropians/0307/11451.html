<p>I tried to catch something of this many years ago in the novel that
<br>
eventually appeared more than a decade later in 1982 as THE JUDAS MANDALA.
<br>
That was when we still thought the universe was heading for a Big Crunch,
<br>
and hadn't yet guessed quite how soon a technological singularity might
<br>
occur. Here's my epiphany, warts and all, from that novel.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick
<br>
<p>==============
<br>
<p>The galaxies wheeled in the immensity of cosmic night, stars spending their
<br>
substance in an orgy of radiance, sucking hydrogen from the frozen void and
<br>
spewing back neutrinos, X rays, light, radio noise, the megaparsec pulses
<br>
of gravitation, and finally the ores and dense evanescent metals forged in
<br>
their bellies, hurled out in the cataclysm of stellar explosion; and in the
<br>
midst of spendthrift fury, on the tiny motes of rock and soil and ocean
<br>
that were the planets, life trod forth blinking from the slimy pools of its
<br>
birth, ate hungrily of the prodigal outpourings of its suns, and changed
<br>
under that same lash into forms strange and wild and beautiful, diverse
<br>
beyond number, swarmed and preyed upon each another's flesh and cooperated
<br>
in the intricate dance of shifting ecologies; and grew wise, at last, wise
<br>
and murderous and choked with dreams, yearning for the unnamable, taming
<br>
that very energy which mindlessly had brought them into being; and killed
<br>
with it, and healed and built with it, went beyond it to now unimagined
<br>
energies created in the convoluted structure of brains and ganglia complex
<br>
beyond precedent; and came, finally, to command their own brutality and
<br>
greatness...
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>The wise beings strode from star to star, galaxy to galaxy, but not to rape
<br>
and pillage. That eon of conquest was now no more than a regretted episode
<br>
in their immense history. They went in joy and respect into the glory that
<br>
extended, it seemed, beyond limit. Eyes of flesh were now eyes of fire, yet
<br>
still flesh; bodies met in the passion of love, and in those meetings made
<br>
new bodies to populate the multicosm and cherish all that lay and moved
<br>
within it. They no longer died; death was a clumsy expedient of random
<br>
evolution, and they had taken evolution into their own charge. Ennui, too,
<br>
was vanished-that specter which once had seemed to spoil the promise of
<br>
utopia-for how is boredom possible in a universe rich with other souls? So
<br>
they went to the curving edges of the universe, learned its physical limits
<br>
and measured and cherished them, learning the infinity within themselves...
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Already more than forty billion years had passed since the first one-celled
<br>
creatures struggled for life in their soupy ponds. The wise ones had
<br>
altered themselves so radically that none of their early planet-bound
<br>
ancestors could have recognized them. They had merged in gestalt unities
<br>
huge as stars, their senses extending across the entire radiation scale and
<br>
into the domain of pure psychic energies. Even now their evolution was not
<br>
complete; the metamorphoses continued. Only the essential qualities of
<br>
humanity remained unaltered: love, joy, creation, reverence. The expansion
<br>
of the spacetime manifold achieved its greatest dimension, faltered; the
<br>
long contraction began. Stars dimmed and died, or faded to a steady ember
<br>
glow. The entity that was Sentience welcomed into its totality the few
<br>
remaining isolated members of the cosmic fellowship. Purpose and
<br>
consciousness infused every energy structure in the multicosm. A hundred
<br>
billion years after it had coalesced from incandescent gas, the universe
<br>
had become a single sentient organism...
