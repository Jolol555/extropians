</em><br>
<em>&gt; bonus.
</em><br>
<p>Granted, you said you hadn't worked out the details,
<br>
but this is a possible future others have thought
<br>
about.
<br>
A few nits, for contemplation:
<br>
<p>* Companies, being the businesses they are, will tend
<br>
towards the maximum profit for the minimal investment.
<br>
If ordinary joes can purchase fabricators, then so can
<br>
companies themselves - or, at least, people working
<br>
for
<br>
companies.  If there is any profit to be had by
<br>
buying a machine then renting it to a company, then
<br>
why
<br>
would the company not just take that profit itself by
<br>
just buying the machine itself?
<br>
<p>* One possible solution: the relationship is actually
<br>
the inverse.  There is one giant factory that can make
<br>
anything, in quantity and fast, but it's so expensive
<br>
that its users can not purchase one.  The few owners
<br>
of
<br>
these fabricators would become super-rich, though they
<br>
may well invest part of their wealth into building
<br>
more
<br>
fabricators.  (Which works out to everyone's benefit,
<br>
but doesn't provide an easy path for Joe Average to
<br>
get more than his fair share of the wealth.)
<br>
<p>* Another: copyright.  Again, assume make-anything
<br>
fabricators, like advanced versions of today's CNC
<br>
machines and 3D printers.  Fit 'em all with DRM (yeah,
<br>
I know, eeevil, but hear me out), and have
<br>
manufacturers shell out royalties when they use a
<br>
design.  (Problem: the analog hole - one could build
<br>
one copy, measure it in every detail, and create an
<br>
identical or near-identical template file licensed to
<br>
oneself.)  Set up a strong tradition of independent
<br>
invention, such that anyone trying to be the RIAA or
<br>
MPAA of this industry would face so much opposition
<br>
from the template file creators themselves as to make
<br>
such monopolization impractical.  (Which could be
<br>
enhanced by making it easy to make template files,
<br>
thus
<br>
reducing any advantage the would-be monopoly could
<br>
bring to bear - but this probably exaggerates the
<br>
analog hole.)  Money goes back and forth to pay for
<br>
all
<br>
the various templates, along with extras like feed
<br>
stock and power (and taxes) - whose owners (or
<br>
collectors) have to pay for templates too.  Joe
<br>
Average
<br>
gets rich (by our standards, anyway) off the extra
<br>
wealth generated in this process, in a classic
<br>
economic
<br>
cycle.
<br>
<p>* Another possibility: the robots provide the services
<br>
themselves, in such overwhelming quantity there is no
<br>
real contention as to whom they serve.  They only need
<br>
power and maintenance, which other robots can provide.
<br>
Of course, that assumes one could get Friendly (or
<br>
close to it) AI, and create robots fast enough to
<br>
quickly blast through the phase where the limited
<br>
number of robots makes people concerned about who
<br>
&quot;owns&quot; them or otherwise has rights to their services.
<br>
(No one &quot;owns&quot; air or seawater because there's so much
<br>
of it, relative to how much we use.  That used to be
<br>
the case for freshwater, too, until the human
<br>
population expanded enough to start putting a strain
<br>
on
<br>
that resource.)
<br>
<p>...and I think I just did a walk through the common,
<br>
nearly done-to-death-in-sci-fi, ways this could play
<br>
out, didn't I?  ^_^;
