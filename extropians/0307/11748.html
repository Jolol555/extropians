<p>As I said years ago, worrying about selling transhumanism or extropianism
<br>
might seem premature when humanism and the Enlightenment aren't exactly
<br>
secure.  Being a math or science tutor might be a specific way of helping
<br>
other people toward our world.  Don't worry at all about exposing them to
<br>
nanotech or AI ideas; just help people not be afraid of numbers, or to
<br>
understand what goes on in science.  You can do this as a volunteer (might
<br>
have to, for younger kids) or for money.  (I'm trying to do that here,
<br>
although I haven't gotten many responses yet.  Haven't put out flyers yet
<br>
either, though, I'm just on a math department website.  The risks of passive
<br>
optimism.  But I helped one woman with calculus and a man with simple geometry
<br>
and fractions.)  There's also being an English tutor, of course.
<br>
<p>Seem like small stuff?  It is.  But there are 280 million people in the US
<br>
alone, never mind the rest of the world.  Face it, almost anything you do will
<br>
be small, because the world is big.  But it's made up of lots of small
<br>
actions.  And there are lots of other ideas: participating in public debates,
<br>
writing public letters, being a political activist, holding a seminar, writing
<br>
a book, yadda yadda.
