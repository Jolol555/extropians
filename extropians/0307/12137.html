<em>&gt; Some people think that the explanation of the Fermi paradox

<em>&gt; any civilization that visibly starts to colonize.  For that,

<em>&gt; I have a parable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a field full of slow plump rabbits, munching on grass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a fox sitting in a tall clump of grass eating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rabbits that happen to wander into that clump.  This fox is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks that he shouldn't leave his clump, because there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-foxes out there, who only eat foxes.  He thinks the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason that there are so many uneaten rabbits out there is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any time a fox comes out to eat a rabbit, a meta-fox sees it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and runs in and eats the fox.  And his reason for not seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any meta-foxes out there eating foxes is that this is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rare event, due to the fact that meta-foxes are very efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and foxes are rare.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My key problem with this scenario is: why don't the meta-foxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat the rabbits?  Why focus on a few hard to catch foxes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Let me add a few belated comments:
<br>
<p>There are internal limits on the size of metafoxes (they don't eat rabbits
<br>
because they would get too big and burst - the old doomsday weapon problem),
<br>
and the number of foxes a metafox can eat per day is also limited. New foxes
<br>
arise at a constant rate, and are in due course eaten, or become meta-foxes.
<br>
Meta-foxes attack each other relentlessly. This assures a dynamic
<br>
equilibrium between fox and meta-fox, as well as a reason to attack foxes
<br>
(to prevent their transformation into meta-foxes), and explains why
<br>
metafoxes are uncommon. It is unclear why meta-foxes each other - maybe they
<br>
are nutritious, due to technical reasons have a substantial first-attacker
<br>
advantage and no way of binding themselves not to attack.
<br>
<p>The cautious fox, appraised of the situation, might indeed try to stay
<br>
inconspicuous, until it develops the first-strike capability needed to eat
<br>
other foxes and meta-foxes, and hope to stay around in this merciless
<br>
struggle for the fun of the kill (since this motive might have the best
<br>
long-term survival advantage).
<br>
<p>With a few assumptions any scenario can be made plausible.
<br>
