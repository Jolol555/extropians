Anders seemed to give good replies to several people, including this to Brent:

<em>&gt; &gt; To take this to the next level will our spreading &quot;garden&quot; consist of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think it is realistic to imagine everything being
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imperative_ by David Pearce where we will sometime around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the year 3000 finally save the last deep ocean invertebrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from aversive experience - I love that passage :-). 
</em><br>
<p>Me too.  Though I agree with you that, as you say, &quot;let evolution
<br>
sort it out&quot; and that we cannot oversee everything, the Pearce
<br>
goal sound very good as a private rather than global project.
<br>
I might, for example, insist that within my own private domain
<br>
there be no aversive experience---be it far from one, however,
<br>
to attempt to dictate what to do to another or to the rest of
<br>
the universe unowned by one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We will likely do this a lot anyway, and might even pass laws about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping creatures endowed with enough nervous systems. But if we are to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constantly monitor every environment we have created, deliberately or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, to save structures from bad experiences and competition, then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not going to be doing much else.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; not long ago on the SL4 list, Perry Metzger spoke of Rice's
<br>
Theorem in a similar context, (the computational infeasibility
<br>
thereof, see <a href="http://kilby.stanford.edu/~rvg/154/handouts/Rice.html">http://kilby.stanford.edu/~rvg/154/handouts/Rice.html</a>)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My ethical position is that we do not have a moral obligation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help everybody and everything, it is up to us to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement from case to case, aided by some general principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally I would love to help a lot of beings in creative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, it is just that I don't think I *have to* help them. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, attempting to &quot;save&quot; every creature is very close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the kind of top-down control that stifles surprises and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution.
</em><br>
<p>All very well said!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We want to minimize irreversible information loss and unnecessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain, but there is a lot of useful information loss and pain too. 
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but you are sounding like one of the usual apologists
<br>
for pain and suffering here.  There really isn't anything that
<br>
can be computed with pain that cannot be computed without it.
