<p><em>&gt; ... then the question becomes whether sins of commission are

</em><br>
<p>Following this thread had been valuable to me personally, because it
<br>
reminded me to consider this question with respect to my own actions.
<br>
Legally, I am required to &quot;stop and render aid&quot; at the scene of any car
<br>
crash I'm involved in. &quot;Defense of others&quot; is an affirmative defense in
<br>
criminal cases, but it would not get you very far if you were accused of the
<br>
crime of killing a doctor who performs abortions. &quot;Aiding and abetting&quot;
<br>
someone in the commission of a crime is a crime in itself, and yet
<br>
conscientious objection is not a recognized defense in tax evasion cases.
<br>
Without even looking at other cultures (such as, for example, cultures in
<br>
which one has a duty to avenge the murder of one's family member by killing
<br>
members of the murderer's family), it seems clear that there is ambiguity in
<br>
the legal system with respect to the duty one owes to other people,
<br>
particularly with respect to crimes of omission.
<br>
<p>Moving from the legal to the moral -- it's relatively easy to state that
<br>
Robert's genocidal speculations were {crazy, wrong, despicable, ... ,
<br>
stupid }; it's far more difficult to refuse to take part in non-productive
<br>
or destructive government projects, such as the over-building of the nuclear
<br>
arsenal (consider the lives that might have been saved if the resources
<br>
dedicated to this had instead been dedicated to more constructive goals).
<br>
One can refuse to take part in this by not paying income taxes (which one
<br>
can legally do by earning only minimal income, as I did when I lived in the
<br>
woods). But in doing this, one loses the monetary power to support private
<br>
research and to support political campaigns of people who might possibly
<br>
influence government policy and so forth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So in the spirit of not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;saying nothing&quot; and &quot;tolerating&quot; that situation I will ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rhetorical question &quot;*What* is each of us doing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent those deaths?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't have any well-formed goals beyond trying to influence the political
<br>
process by working on amicus curiae briefs in certain lawsuits, presenting
<br>
testimony in legislative committee hearings, and purchasing stock or loaning
<br>
money to fund promising research.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might be interesting from a bioethical standpoint to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truman's justification (using the bomb instead of troops)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Hitler's arguments (for eliminating the Jews) side-by-side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see where the similarities and dissimilarities are.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think it would be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that &quot;War is Hell&quot;.  I also believe that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on the list do *not* think we are at war.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  I don't consider the things I mentioned above (trying to influence
<br>
the political process and supporting research) mere hobbies. They are a
<br>
matter of life and death to me personally, as I am already 53 years old, and
<br>
though I don't suffer from any particular health problem at the moment, my
<br>
odds of dying young are at present quite high.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't hesitate to kill someone who was directly threatening me or
<br>
someone I love. I *know* this about myself, because I have been in that
<br>
situation twice. As it turned out, I did not have to kill anyone, but I was
<br>
fully prepared to to do if it had been necessary to protect myself.
<br>
<p>But I find this question extremely disturbing:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Are we are willing to sacrifice humanity due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal or moral repugnance?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>In the same way that I avoid dealing with a person whom I observe cheating
<br>
someone else (he may tell me, &quot;Look, I'll cheat person X, but I'd never
<br>
cheat you. You're my friend.&quot; But there's no assurance that I might not
<br>
later join the set of non-friends), I would avoid dealing with a person who
<br>
is willing to toss out his personal code of ethics whenever it appears to
<br>
him to be practical. Likewise, I would avoid becoming associated with any
<br>
organization that tolerated this viewpoint. I believe that Robert is on the
<br>
Board of Directors of the Extropy Institute. Therefore, what he says in
<br>
public (especially on a mailing list supported by the Institute) can be
<br>
attributed to that organization. I would suggest that if the other board
<br>
members do not hold this view, they make public statements that Robert's
<br>
views do not reflect the position of the Extropy Institute.
