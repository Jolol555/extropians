<em>&gt; Further in the future, a lot depends on the course of world politics.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting possibility.  It might depend more on technology than world 
<br>
politics.  At some point, it will become feasible for anyone with a 
<br>
high-school diploma to build a high-yield weapon and for a small number 
<br>
of not-very-smart people to position them worldwide in an attempt to 
<br>
take over the world by force.  The Dr. Evil scenario.  There will 
<br>
likely be multiple such groups and they will be competing.  I expect 
<br>
what we're seeing today is the beginnings of this scenario.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world that becomes substantially less free seems inevitably to lead to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crippled fight against aging, which means we are all dead.
</em><br>
<p>It's truly sad that our ability to kill each other is growing more 
<br>
quickly than our ability to heal each other, however, if some or 
<br>
several Dr. Evil's do take over the world, they're likely to want to 
<br>
make rapid progress in the field of preserving their own power, and by 
<br>
extension lives, indefinitely.  If this happens, they're likely to both 
<br>
be able to acquire the resources and recognize the value of the 
<br>
endeavor.  I'd like to be there when Dr. Evil does and I can just take 
<br>
a bag full of his life-extension pills from his office and slip away 
<br>
unnoticed.
<br>
<p>Either way, though, you're right.  We're all dead.  Either in 10 or 
<br>
10,000,000,000 years, everyone will die eventually.  Even if we 
<br>
possessed the technology to create limitless health-regeneration, it's 
<br>
likely we won't ever possess the power not to make mistakes or to make 
<br>
peace.
<br>
<p>As for terrorism, one friend of mine had a dual experience - once was 
<br>
in a hotel in Kuwait in 1991 when the Iraqi's walked in and told him he 
<br>
was dead meat.  One &quot;nice soldier&quot; let him get away - a two hour walk 
<br>
through the desert.  The same man was living in NYC in 2001 when the 
<br>
WTC went down 2-blocks or so from his office.  &quot;Affected&quot; is a broad 
<br>
term.  My daughter was born Sept. 11, 2001, so it wasn't such a bad day 
<br>
after all, if you ask me.
<br>
<p>I am mostly unconcerned about terrorism.  I remember when going to 
<br>
Ireland from England was a walk past 30 machine-gun carrying brits, and 
<br>
I remember thinking that the Irish were much nicer than the soldiers 
<br>
who searched my bags because I looked like I might have been carrying 
<br>
drugs (I wasn't and didn't).  But I remember the same year the bombing 
<br>
of victoria station, and thinking that the Irish weren't necessarily 
<br>
all as nice as the ones I'd met in the pubs.  In any case,  I second 
<br>
the notion that the greater fear is that our freedoms will be further 
<br>
eroded by our government in the wake of terrorism-phobia.
<br>
<p>Safety is a religious notion.  In that respect, I feel safe.
