<em>&gt; Nice stuff James.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; btw, don't write off maths as useless. All the applied stuff finds its roots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the purely theoretical. All our great technology bases on a mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legacy reaching back thousands of years. I think we undervalue pure research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, which is a pity.
</em><br>
<p>Oops, I guess I came across as writing off pure maths research as
<br>
useless :) I really didn't mean that: I think it's terribly important.
<br>
Unfortunately, I see research as a journey down a fractally branching
<br>
path of ideas, each of varying utility. It pains me to write off any
<br>
branch as 'useless', but some have more extropian applications than
<br>
others, or at least (and this is what it always boils down to, isn't
<br>
it?) the probability of having extropian applications is low for maybe
<br>
the majority of branches. I'm sure there are some fundamental and
<br>
extropically vital theorems waiting to be discovered, but the chance of
<br>
me happening upon the branch that leads to them is much, much lower than
<br>
that of 'wasting' my time researching things of peripheral importance. I
<br>
guess I'm just selfish. I want these theorems to be discovered, but if I
<br>
only have a 1/1000 chance of doing it, I'd rather spend my time on
<br>
something with a higher probability of generating results (that
<br>
something being teaching).
<br>
<p>The other side of the coin is that I'm not entirely convinced an
<br>
Extropian future will materialise. If this all turns out to be hype, I'd
<br>
like to find myself doing something which is still worthwhile.
