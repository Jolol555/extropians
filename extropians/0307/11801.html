<br>
- Behavioral, drug, and genetic interventions vs. aging
<br>
- Brain computer interfaces
<br>

<br>
- Socio-economic and political issues of enhancement
<br>
- Specific responses to Kass, Fukuyama, McKibben, and other critics of
<br>
human enhancement
<br>
<p>2) Speaking on the above topics, which will accelerate as the book's
<br>

<p>Read and critique my book!  I'm particularly interested in feedback
<br>
from:
<br>
<p>A) Domain experts in the above topics
<br>
<p>B) Readers of other pop-science books
<br>
<p>C) Those who expect these technologies to cause social problems
