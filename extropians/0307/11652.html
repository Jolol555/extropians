</em><br>
<p>Ah. So you do not think that any of the historical villains thought they 
<br>
had really good causes? 
<br>
<p>Creating a free and egalitarian world is a nice sounding goal, but
<br>
ideologies claiming this have killed tens of millions of people in the
<br>
20th century. And I would argue that it was not because they were all
<br>
corrupted; quite a bit of the killing was seen as regretable necessity 
<br>
in order to save all the others. Even worse track record can be found 
<br>
among ideologies that seek some future or non-material good goal, like 
<br>
salvation or racial survival - here the killing was not even seen as 
<br>
regrettable.
<br>
<p>Good causes are plentiful, but they are not worth getting *others* 
<br>
killed for. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the &quot;valuation of lives&quot; goes to the crux of the matter.  Nick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in his paper suggested there were some alternate perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of utilitarian evaluations, Anders expanded on this quite a bit in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his comments (much to my education).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the problem is not simple and it doesn't go away (just because we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find the discussion repulsive).
</em><br>
<p>This is true. From time to time we do get into the uncomfortable 
<br>
situation where we might have to take actions that kill innocent people 
<br>
in order to (say) safeguard ourselves from terrorism. It is at that 
<br>
point we need good principles to guide us.
<br>
<p>As an example, I have several times argued against pre-emptive strikes 
<br>
both on this list and in off-list discussion (e.g. my debate with Nick 
<br>
on the Berlin Transvision about existential risks) since I consider it a 
<br>
very bad principle to follow ethically and the likely destabilizing 
<br>
effects of following it (even when you do not strike others know you 
<br>
might, and it is better to prepare - in secret). That is one principle 
<br>
discussion that has become rather important lately.
<br>
<p>Evaluating the &quot;value&quot; of human lives is another issue - even framing a 
<br>
choice in terms of comparing the value of group A versus group B is a 
<br>
decision with rather deep ethical implications (it does imply that 
<br>
humans have values that can be somehow compared, a position not all 
<br>
ethical views accept). 
<br>
<p>In practice, when we sit in the war room and the Chief of Staff asks us
<br>
what to do, we will likely use the usual human mix of principles,
<br>
prejudices, assumptions and more-and-less rational thinking to make
<br>
strategic decisions. The thing to aim for is to have done as much good 
<br>
thinking before that point as possible, so that the final decision is 
<br>
influenced by ideas of some depth. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But the point I am trying to get at is *when* the negentropic losses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are acceptable?  Is the saving of a single human life worth a sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by humanity?  In medicine this is known as &quot;triage&quot; -- and it involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some very difficult decisions as to how one optimizes who one saves.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. I don't think the current framing of the discussion will help 
<br>
it, but it needs to be looked at from many perspectives. 
<br>
<p>Looking at societies from a direct triage analogy, we have the direct
<br>
care societies (might do well if we help them *now*), delayed care
<br>
(might get better on their own or if we help them later) and the
<br>
unsalvageable societies (we cannot help them). So from this perspective
<br>
we set up criteria about what we can do (for example, do we have
<br>
resources to replace governments, do nation building, change culture etc
<br>
and how much can we do it?) and then evaluate where to send in aid. 
<br>
Elements from psychiatric emergency triage can be brought in to analyse
<br>
the issue of aggressiveness and threat.
<br>
<p>Hmm, this might actually be worth looking at in more depth. I'm not that 
<br>
well read in emergency medicine, but there is some interesting analogies 
<br>
here. Not to mention the medical philosophy discussions underlying 
<br>
triage principles.
