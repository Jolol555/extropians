Orienting the East: U. Michigan Psychologist Richard Nisbett Asks: Do
<br>
Asians and Westerners Think Differently? by Hua Hsu
<br>
<p>In 1944, the eminent Chinese anthropologist and sociologist Fei Xiaotang
<br>
accepted an offer from the State Department to spend a year working in
<br>
the United States. Fei's stint began with all of the excitement and
<br>
wonder promised by this still-rising star among nations, but as the
<br>
months drew on he grew exhausted with the fidgety, restless nature that
<br>
outlined every feature of American life. He returned to China wiser and
<br>
more attuned to American customs, but thankful that they were not his
<br>
own: &quot;American children hear no stories about ghosts. They spend a dime
<br>
at the drugstore to buy a Superman comic book. . . . Superman represents
<br>
actual capabilities or future potential, while ghosts symbolize belief
<br>
in and reverence for the accumulated past. How could ghosts gain a
<br>
foothold in American cities? People move like the tide, unable to form
<br>
permanent ties with places, still less with other people. . . . In a
<br>
world without ghosts, life is free and easy. American eyes can gaze
<br>
straight ahead. But still I think they lack something and I do not envy
<br>
their life.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fei's ennui would lead to a complete turnabout in thought as he went
<br>
from a fascinated student of American culture to a strident critic. But
<br>
rather than causing us to write him off as someone who, say, hates us
<br>
for our freedom, Fei's comments suggest deeper assumptive differences.
<br>
University of Michigan psychologist Richard Nisbett explores the
<br>
psychological dimension of this gap in his new book, The Geography of
<br>
Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently . . . and Why (Free
<br>
Press). &quot;The Easterner lives in a very complex social world where role
<br>
relations are much more important than in the West,&quot; he explains over
<br>
the phone from his office in Ann Arbor. &quot;The person is literally a
<br>
different person if they're taken out of their web of relationships.
<br>
That's just not the attitude in the West-in the West, I'm a bundle of
<br>
attributes. What I am is my wants, needs, traits, and abilities. I am a
<br>
package of those things, and I am that package regardless of the social
<br>
milieu in which I find myself.&quot;

<br>
<p>I heard a Richard Nisbett on the radio a few weeks ago.  It sounded like
<br>
an interesting topic.  I wonder how well this fits with Chris
<br>
Sciabarra's methodological orientations and Stephen C. Pepper's world
<br>
hypotheses (nod toward Jeff Riggenbach on that reference).  Or do you
<br>
think it's merely the latest form of stereotyping?
<br>
<p>Any comments?
