<em>&gt;&gt; How do the stories about the teenagers differ? Is it that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stories about adults are often invented as an excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; politicians to exert control, but the stories about teenagers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are always told by truthful Bayesians?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why, no.  The stories (or claims) are in many cases the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same.  The difference is that one can isolate oneself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from abusive adults, even spouses.  But one cannot get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away from one's own children.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This seems mostly false. Parents have substantial ability to get away
<br>
from their children by sending them to boarding schools, camps, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;Or are you claiming (as I suspect Hal would) that the parents have
<br>
an obligation to allow the kids to remain at home? (I'm not sure what
<br>
to make of such a claim, but I suspect parents still can mostly avoid
<br>
the kids by not being home as much as they can avoid an abusive adult
<br>
who requires some care for medical reasons).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I can't think of a good reason why we should respect any parent who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; imprisons kids for actions that the government shouldn't treat as crimes.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Are you aware of some argument for permitting it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here I read this as &quot;permitting a parent to send a child
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to his or her room&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; other than that the means required to prevent it are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sometimes unethical?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't see that the state must adopt &quot;unethical&quot; means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to control the actions that adults take against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children.  But I do see such laws (i.e. means) as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deleterious to, ultimately, economic and social progress.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm puzzled by the claim that laws against coercion would deter progress.
<br>
Let me make an analogy to laws against slavery. Did they interfere with
<br>
progress? Or are you arguing that there's some difference in the coercions
<br>
involved that should motivate us to classify them differently? I can see
<br>
differences in degree, but my default is to presume any coercion is wrong
<br>
unless there's a clear argument that it's needed.
