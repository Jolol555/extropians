I wonder if Falwell was paid by the pharmaceutical cartel to print this. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, it mistakenly, but cleverly, connects the LEF with Alcor in order to 
<br>
drag in cryonics and Ted Williams, all in the interests of demonizing cheap 
<br>
overseas drugs which would lower drug prices here in the USA.  A clever but 
<br>
transparent ploy to tar cheap drugs with taboo cryonics.  Transparent to me, 
<br>
but to the soccer mom and dad masses with their kids and car payments and 
<br>
mortgages and their vacations....they will probably never notice....

<p>Excerpts from the article:
<br>
<p>Choose life, not drug importation
<br>
<p>By Jerry Falwell
<br>
<p>The battle to safeguard human life has been raging for decades, creating
<br>
strong alliances built on shared values and common passions. Yet, for those
<br>
in the pro-life movement, it is essential not to lose sight of the big
<br>
picture when innocent lives are being threatened. When I see even strong
<br>
pro-life voices in Congress grappling with an issue that threatens life, I
<br>
want their supporters to know it.
<br>
<p>Importation of foreign drugs into the tightly protected U.S. market is one
<br>
of those issues. The idea is that, since medicines can be cheaper outside
<br>
the country, we should bring them back into the country at that lower price.
<br>
Sounds simple, but unfortunately, drug importation is about much more than
<br>
getting cheap prescriptions. It's also partially about easing access in our
<br>
country to abortion drugs like RU-486, euthanasia drugs and &quot;life extension&quot;
<br>
drugs of questionable merit and potentially harmful effect.
<br>
<p>Would drug importation make non-FDA approved drugs legal, or put
<br>
prescription drugs in the hands of those without prescriptions? No.
<br>
Would it make it easier for those who crave deadly drugs to get them?
<br>
Unquestionably.
<br>
<p>The issue centers on a piece of legislation known as the Pharmaceutical
<br>
Market Access Act. According to news accounts, the bill is scheduled to come
<br>
to a vote within the next two weeks. It would serve to essentially open the
<br>
floodgates to drugs from outside the country, allowing drugs with unknown
<br>
origins, production methods, packaging guidelines and transportation
<br>
standards into the American prescription drug supply.
<br>
<p>Some of them will be real pills, on which another country's socialized
<br>
health care has imposed a lower price. But some will be counterfeit, some
<br>
copied and some even poisoned. Once these drugs hit the American drug
<br>
supply, there is no controlling where they go and whom they impact. What's
<br>
more, ratcheting open the walls that protect our market for medicines means
<br>
that those who want to import bizarre and unethical medications will have
<br>
that much more opportunity to do so.
<br>
<p>Consider those supporting drug importation off Capitol Hill, and that
<br>
perverse motivation becomes clear.
<br>
For instance, drug importation advocates regularly cite research from the
<br>
Alcor Life Extension Foundation in their arguments. But the so-called Life
<br>
Extension Foundation (LEF), ironically, is a rabidly anti-life organization.
<br>
It has cited RU-486 as an &quot;anti-aging&quot; medication that once just missed its
<br>
top 10 list of life-extending drugs. LEF has demonstrated its disregard for
<br>
human life not only by advocating cloning but embryonic stem cell research
<br>
to reverse the signs of aging. Those who support taking the lives of unborn
<br>
children to support the selfish desire to live a longer and fuller life are
<br>
not the allies we hope to see advocating public policy changes for America.
<br>
<p>That is only the beginning, however. LEF also conducts bizarre cryogenics
<br>
experiments. They are reported to have the body of baseball slugger Ted
<br>
Williams frozen for eventual reanimation. The president of the organization,
<br>
Saul Kent, likewise froze his mother's severed head, prompting a three-year
<br>
investigation into the possibility that she was euthanized. And they traffic
<br>
in untold numbers of questionable &quot;life-extending&quot; medications that are the
<br>
subject of numerous federal investigations - raising a significant question
<br>
about their motivations for advocating drug importation.
<br>
<p>Supporters of drug importation are also relying upon a new book by Katharine
<br>
Greider, &quot;The Big Fix.&quot; 
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><p>The fact is that both the LEF and Ms. Greider have as priorities opening
<br>
American drug markets as wide as possible. These are not the allies that
<br>
pro-life members of Congress should be working with on issues of such great
<br>
pith and moment. Their priority is not cheaper drugs for our seniors - the
<br>
priority of the well-meaning members of Congress who support drug
<br>
importation - but instead, to get easier access to abortion and to bizarre
<br>
and untested therapies outside the country.
<br>
<p>Those concerned about innocent human life, as well as those concerned about
<br>
the lives of anyone who takes medications in America, should call on
<br>
pro-life members of Congress to stand by their commitment to life and to
<br>
reject the misguided research of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation and
<br>
Katharine Greider.
