Natasha said:
<br>
<p>&quot;We may never change the way a many in the Greenpeace community or the
<br>
Rifkin community, or the Leon Cass community, but we can design ways
<br>
that will help people communicate about the problems more effectively.&quot;
<br>
<p>This brings up a potential method for countering these memes I have
<br>
tossed around occasionally.  
<br>
<p>Suggestion, list the major proponents of non-extropic memes (start with
<br>
obvious ones to minimize debate over extropic vs. non extropic) and keep
<br>
an eye on their public appearances.  If they are to be on a radio show,
<br>
have some good counters ready to be called in and voiced.  If they
<br>
publish an editorial, find an extropian nearby to publish a counter.  If
<br>
they are on TV, hope it's a call in show and voice opposing opinions, or
<br>
ask powerful questions to get listeners thinking. If they are to appear
<br>
publicly, put a few fliers up outlining counter arguments, send letters
<br>
to editorials of local publications, be present at public lectures to
<br>
ask tough questions, etc. etc.  
<br>
<p>People assisting in this effort might take up an individual
<br>
anti-extropic person as his 'target' and just update other volunteers
<br>
relevant to next appearance as to anti-extropic persons appearance.
<br>
Each person could pick his one target to get intimately familiar with
<br>
said targets typical arguments, and could assist others in preparing
<br>
questions, flyers, or commentaries ready to be launched at the
<br>
anti-extropic individual.  Each individual would be responsible for
<br>
responding to any anti-extropic memes that arise In his/her immediate
<br>
vicinity (say, area code) Obviously in more populace areas more
<br>
volunteers would be needed so as to not monopolize the time of any one
<br>
volunteer.  I think with enough people, this could have a pretty
<br>
significant positive impact, yet still only require 10 - 20 minutes each
<br>
week on average from volunteers.
