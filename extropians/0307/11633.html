moderating or accepting any complaints for many years now.
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You related one instance where Hal did moderate -- he stopped you from 
<br>
complaining on behalf of others.  I was not aware he stopped you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor are you aware that he talked to others where I am aware that he 
<br>
did do so.  However he did that privately and in my opinion was ultimately 
<br>
persuasive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in listening to you I come to this view.  Because Hal chose to 
<br>
operate off list and quietly, but in my opinion effectively, he has no public 
<br>
record of being an effective bull of the woods.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet people are remarking that the flame wars have sure died down.  
<br>
That did not happen accidentally.  Hal was appointed, I happen to know of some of 
<br>
his actions, they are enough to persuade me that he probably took other 
<br>
actions and IMO a favorable result was obtained for the list.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all that is left is to persuade you that it is enough for Hal to 
<br>
operate as a moderator efficiently and quietly -- he has no need to wear blue 
<br>
and red tights with a cape and travel in great leaps and bounds.  I like him.
<br>
Ron h.
