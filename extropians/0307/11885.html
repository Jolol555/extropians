<em>&gt; &gt;It seems a great pity that amongst the first things  intelligent

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a useful ability whether u admit it or not.
</em><br>
<p>You: I definately *do* admit that it is a useful ability. I think
<br>
I am a perhaps a bit like Harvey in that I have an emotional
<br>
predispisiton towards people playing nice.
<br>
I see it as efficient as well as pleasant. But given that people don't  
<br>
always play nice I am certainly willing to fall back on
<br>
the alternatives.
<br>
<p>Me: Agreed :) Thats generally how I play it ;P
<br>
<p>You: I'm a rationalist humanist. I like to cooperate. But I am
<br>
also a reasonable bush lawyer and former state karate
<br>
champion I don't need to learn that sometimes the 
<br>
opportunity to play nice is taken off the table by others. Then, if
<br>
truth be told I probably find the honesty and 
<br>
directness of a real knock down take no prisoners fight preferable to
<br>
the namby pamby half hearted exchanges 
<br>
of petty spites. I don't *like* the *ambiguity* of the middle ground of
<br>
minor petttiness. I like it to be *clear* whether 
<br>
cooperation or competition is the optimal mode as then *I* can commit
<br>
more fully to either and not waste my
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Me: Hahahahaha :) I doubt things are resolved to ur satisfaction on a
<br>
regular basis,
<br>
insofar as people who would feel the need to reach for the &quot;ambiguity of
<br>
the middle ground&quot;
<br>
are rarely capable (emotionally) to offer such a clear statement of
<br>
intent.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps I'm coloring I'm simply painting it through the lense of my
<br>
experiences.
<br>
<p>&lt;shrugs&gt;
<br>
<p>But in essence (at least theoretically), I agree.  RL tends to be less
<br>
direct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;... and the great fear that stops a lesser mind from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming a greater mind is the fear of looking stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh I'd agree with that statement insofar as it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limiting factor for  attempting new directions;
</em><br>
<p>You: Hell, more than that its a limiting factor in learning. 
<br>
Most of us live lives surrounded by sources of good 
<br>
information and people who will as happily help us
<br>
and return one good turn for another as not. Once
<br>
one builds up some credibility and a stock of skills
<br>
contacts and a knowledge base to trade even the 
<br>
trade gets to be informal and people with win/win
<br>
attitudes to mutual empowerment tend to seek 
<br>
each other out.
<br>
<p>Me: Thats also limited though by ur access to such people,
<br>
and what they have to offer in trade (versus what
<br>
you are offering and their needs).  For instance,
<br>
I have run {acting as one of those people who 
<br>
is very skilled in several areas within my 
<br>
extended family} into several roadblocks; the largest
<br>
being the difference in experience levels between
<br>
my own level, and that of several cousins and other
<br>
associated ilk, despite being of similar chronological
<br>
age.  The reality of the situation is that without a
<br>
bloodline (regardless of time in shared common experiences),
<br>
I would probably not have bothered, since they have nothing
<br>
notable of trade.  Even the most sophisticated of them
<br>
required (practically speaking), approx 3 years to even
<br>
begin to develop an outlook that will eventually lead to
<br>
a good set of offerrings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The fear of *looking* stupid might very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cost people their lives in coming decades. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ignorance and stupidity are not the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We all start ignorant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to think we all remain ignorant [given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sheer volume of  information and possibilities]; some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us just manage to migrate to (slightly) lesser degrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ignorance.
</em><br>
<p>You: I see in this what I consider to be a socrates fallacy, ie, 
<br>
the notion that as nothing can really be known the 
<br>
person who thinks they know nothing is actually wisest.
<br>
<p>Me: Oh I wouldn't go so far;  I am merely pointing
<br>
out to pin down any particular statement as a fact,
<br>
you generally have to limit the domain in which u are
<br>
discussing; and that given true mastery of this 
<br>
environment {which is at least, my goal} cannot be
<br>
had given the limitation just expressed, ergo we will
<br>
never be able to completely remove from ourselves
<br>
a state of ignorance {given the expansion of the domain}
<br>
:)
<br>
<p>Or as David Bowie said in one of his songs,
<br>
that @ a certain point in development {of say, a technology},
<br>
I don't prefer knowledge, just certainty :)
<br>
<p>You:
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>We are social to an extent, (it is not sensible or useful
<br>
or healthy for us to personally doubt this), we are
<br>
reasonable to an extent ( again let socrates or the 
<br>
neo-socratics take a shot at that as a fallacy). Once
<br>
we know we are social and we are ration we know
<br>
some things that are useful to us, to our happiness
<br>
and our development. We learn that we have freedoms
<br>
but that we remain free within bounds. We cannot
<br>
violate the contingent nature of the universe.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
Yes, but that leaves in a continual state of ignorance,
<br>
does it not?  There *is* no final point of enlightment
<br>
where we mystically shed our ignorance and reach
<br>
an enlightended state :)  Ergo my previous statement
<br>
of simply being able to reach lesser degrees of ignorance.
<br>
<p>You:
<br>
My point, ignorance is a natural starting postion and
<br>
it is not something to be *ashamed* of, but nor is it 
<br>
in itself a positive virtue. Socrates was wrong. The 
<br>
wisest man is not the man who knows he knows 
<br>
nothing. Imo :-)  A wiser man knows that he is 
<br>
rational and social and that he will find health and satisfaction and 
<br>
good relations at least potentially with other men 
<br>
(or women) if he proceeds on the basis of these truths 
<br>
that present themselves to him on a level even 
<br>
more fundamental than  scientific truths. 
<br>
<p>Me:  I wouldn't go so far as to agree with you
<br>
regarding ur point on Socrates;  I think we 
<br>
simply differ in our intrepratations :)  You
<br>
seem to imply that Socrates was saying ignorance
<br>
is a blessed state; whereas I think that Socrates
<br>
was stating a simple truth; that no matter how much
<br>
knowledge you accumulate, there is still so much
<br>
more to learn, and past that, too many probabilities
<br>
to deal with.  He wasn't explicitly giving a
<br>
comparison function; merely observing that anyone
<br>
with half a brain will also have hit a similar
<br>
conclusion.... which of course, implies a test of sorts....
<br>
Of course, the game can get deeper from there :)
<br>
<p>and BTW - just because you achieve a lesser state
<br>
of ignorance does not mean u neccesarily are more
<br>
competent that someone else in the grand scheme of
<br>
things; I, for instance, though quite skilled in several
<br>
areas, would not care to go head to head with a peasant
<br>
in the area concerning growing things.  In other words,
<br>
knowledge is not an instant path to success :) The fitness
<br>
of ur function depends heavily on the environment in which
<br>
you are competing.
