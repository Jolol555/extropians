<em>&gt; &gt; That's a pretty dumb question!  Like your

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps it does not advance rational discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was a serious question, though.
</em><br>
<p>I took Robert's question to be serious. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The disconnect between the words being verbally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated into sentence streams, and all affect, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion, intuitive visualization, was large enough 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sanity, or at least such small sanity as humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are supposed to have.
</em><br>
<p>Gees, Eliezer, Robert puts a serious question (by
<br>
*your* account), you write 'are you autistic' and 
<br>
then despite the fact that Robert has not stated
<br>
anything further on the matter in this thread you're
<br>
still talking as though Robert's sanity is something
<br>
you seriously doubt and/or are in a position to pass 
<br>
judgement on. I think your have now surpassed 
<br>
Robert in the faux pas count. 
<br>
<p>There are some very important and worthwhile issues
<br>
behind the screens of political correctness and even
<br>
intelligent people need to be able to make a mistake
<br>
occassionally if those issues are to be explored and
<br>
solutions illuminated.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Hiroshima bomber crew did not, contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legend, have nightmares about it.  They flew back,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truman told them that he took responsibility, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was that.  Can you imagine if they'd had to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walk along a line of  seventy thousand people and,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one by one, slit their throats - let alone being forced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to burn them in fire?  
</em><br>
<p>Truthfully, I can't, or rather I probably could to ceertain
<br>
degree but I don't want to (not 70,000 unique individuals
<br>
in the full or near full detail of their individual humanity).
<br>
I probably could imagine quite a few if I had good reason
<br>
to and probably, though I am not sure of this, so could you.
<br>
Still, the point about triage is a valid and an important one. 
<br>
There are people in the world that do have the power to
<br>
make decisions that will determine the fates of far more 
<br>
individuals than they will have the time to personally 
<br>
consider as individual instances of humanity in detail.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Politicans must do it, generals must do it. There is no
<br>
escaping the need to triage for some of us who are rational.
<br>
To not take responsibility simply leaves the responsibility to
<br>
others. The point surely then becomes how to triage well. 
<br>
How to minimize pain or loss and this must be done with
<br>
a certain level of detachment or the problem at issue is not
<br>
what one is considering. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One by one, letting each soldier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or man or woman or schoolchild finish dying before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving on to the next? They would not have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past the first ten, they would have had nightmares for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of their lives, and if Truman told them he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;accepted full responsibility&quot; it would have been a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pathetic, useless token. 
</em><br>
<p>Did *you* actually imagine 10 Eliezer? If so, in how 
<br>
much detail? It seems to me that you are either doing
<br>
what Robert did by painting an unpleasant scenario to 
<br>
explore an important question or you are just blowing 
<br>
gas.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dave Grossman is exactly right; technological distance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is emotional distance.  Bomber crews don't have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nightmares because they wield  buttons instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knives, though the suffering they cause is vastly greater.
</em><br>
<p>And you know this *how*?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert Bradbury has no goddamn idea what the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming out of his mouth actually mean.  That much is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear. 
</em><br>
<p>No it is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And similarly the people who dropped the bomb on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hiroshima had no goddamn idea what that button 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually did, regardless of what verbal ideas were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; floating around in their heads.  Hugo de Garis has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goddamn idea of what a 'gigadeath' 'artilect war' would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involve, and Ben Goertzel has no goddamn idea that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI is an existential risk, regardless of what words they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put down on paper.  Being unable to relate abstract 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verbal thought to negative affect is not a charming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal quirk. 
</em><br>
<p>Seriously, do you think you are making an argument or
<br>
do you realise that you are preaching a sort of gospel 
<br>
according to EY?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert is just emotionally disconnected from the results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what he's saying, not evil; he has no idea that he might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be doing something wrong, though he realizes in a distant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that he ought to acknowledge the possibility.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; y'know, by golly, I bet that when all the bodies are counted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up across the galaxies, it's the Roberts and not the Hitlers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who account for most of the planetary kills.
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to take that bet. Precisely how do you propose that
<br>
we operationalise it? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There comes a point where stupidity stops being innocent,
</em><br>
<p>This I agree with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  and it doesn't really matter anymore whether you have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be emotionally evil as well as verbally evil to genuinely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a bad person. 
</em><br>
<p>This is an unsubstatiated thesis. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that line is crossed when you start talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of nuclear weapons to commit genocide against those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darn foreigners because paying attention would be too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconvenient.
</em><br>
<p>I think a line is crossed when people can't tell the difference
<br>
between an abstract discussion and concrete actions. I 
<br>
thought Robert was trying to have an abstract discussion 
<br>
on an important issue. You, if you are to be taken at your
<br>
words concluded quite a lot more was going on.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we need a new subject header class [adults only].
