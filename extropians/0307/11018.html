<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But what reason is there to think that laws and the bloated

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will stop somebody selling colored water as orange juice better
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I am somewhat uneasy at applying market logic to issues regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; basic human needs. Even assuming that the market will adjust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; perfectly, it will do at the public expense (at first): for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; if a producer sells some poisoned food, the market will not correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; it before some people die. Or, if very unsafe cars are sold, again
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; they will continue to be sold until they are demonstrated unsafe on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the market, e.g. when people die because of them (come to think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; it, the FDA is doing a better job than automobile regulations...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### This is incorrect. Only unpredictable dangers will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; inadequately addressed by the market (but this is the nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; world - the unpredictable by definition defies a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; preventative action, whether individual or collectivist). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; predictable dangers can be easily addressed by civil liability and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; insurance. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not so sure. Just to stay with the previous examples, I have heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough examples of questionable behaviour by food industries (I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about GM, but about for example wine with methanol, junk food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made more or less out of plastic, etc.) and car makers (SUVs rolling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than billiard balls, plastic-made little cars that crush into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing), even with all the checks currently in place. Most of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are attempts to sidestep those checks and regulations, which can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surely result in lawsuits. But we see that a minority of companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep trying.
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, they keep trying, but do they succeed? If the courts are swift,
<br>
information flow about quality unimpeded, and liability more expensive than
<br>
the &quot;questionable behavior&quot;, it is really a bad idea to try to add methanol
<br>
to your wine.
<br>
<p>Bribing an inspector assigned to you by the state oversight agency tends to
<br>
be cheaper than bribing all the independent free market quality analysts
<br>
attracted by rumors of your wrongdoing (and there will be rumors once you
<br>
start cheating), all the customers who find out they have been cheated, and
<br>
all the courts hired by your customers. The state thrives on corruption
<br>
because it is a monopoly, the free market is much more resistant to it.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A market solution would wait for the first incidents to appear before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing anything.
</em><br>
<p>### No, the increased cost of liability insurance or credit appears well
<br>
before somebody is predictably harmed. Really. If you are caught driving
<br>
drunk, your liability insurance (in the free market) will go up well before
<br>
you hit somebody.
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;And if the lawsuit deterrent is not working now, I
<br>
<em>&gt; have some doubts that it would be working then. At least, we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have many examples of pure-markets to see if it happens this or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>### Manufacturers are bending over backwards to avoid being targeted by
<br>
lawsuits. Of course, the effectiveness of the legal system is impaired by
<br>
the fact that the state owns and operates courts, instead allowing private
<br>
courts to operate and compete. So you have slow, expensive courts bound by
<br>
statutes and regulations, but this is just another argument for the free
<br>
market.
