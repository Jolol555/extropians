<br>
<em>&gt; In some extreme cases I guess it is appropriate to attack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone personally, so she or he gets a chance to reevaluate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his/her thoughts. Whenever it comes to the support of killing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people for any cause whatsoever, except for oself defense I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I even have the obligation for a personal attack.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Obligation for a personal attack&quot;?  I have been flooded with these kinds of
<br>
messages.  So many people on this list believe that resorting to personal
<br>
attack is legitimate and necessary for rational conversation.  They
<br>
literally do not support the list rules against personal attacks and have no
<br>
intention of abiding by those rules.  This is the root cause of all the
<br>
personal attacks on this list.  It is not a mistaken slip of the tongue when
<br>
emotions get high.  Some people deliberately want to engage in personal
<br>
attack and believe that this is the ultimately effective form of debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The ad hominem rules might be appropriate most of the time, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but they loose their effectiveness at the event horizon of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black hole thinking desasters like the one Mr. Bradbury has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proved to be capable of. Here the ad hominem protections 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crumble under the gravity of his comment and are transformed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a useless collection of academic placebo pills. With 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words: a load of bullshit.
</em><br>
<p>You can attack bad ideas all you want.  How does attacking the person help?
<br>
If you cannot logically explain why an idea is wrong, and can only resort to
<br>
name-calling, insults and trying to denigrate a person until they give up
<br>
and leave, you have no business debating the issue.  Such tactics are not
<br>
&quot;debate&quot;.  They are a method to suppress and avoid debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Returning to cases where ad hominem might be appropriate: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists supporting a war of aggression. I know in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance, that I will get a bloody nose if I, say, kick some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons of ass destruction (no misspelling here!) into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crowd of proud patriots that represent the majority of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively posting members of this virtual community. But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's okay, I accept it and I can live with the bruises. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it has to do with a different kind of ironic and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sarcastic discussion culture in intellectual German circles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where no one is surprised if he receives a personal attack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for his shitty views. Frankly, I am surprised how many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puritans and preacher's daughters are present on this list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and who are ready to faint if someone uses more substantial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hearty words without making an affected fuss about it.
</em><br>
<p>Might does not make right.  Just because you can yell someone down or insult
<br>
them until they leave does not mean you have won the debate.  This method
<br>
serves no useful purpose in planning the future.  This is a discussion
<br>
forum.  All you see on the screen are words and ideas.  There is no reason
<br>
to become abusive.  You should be able to express your counter ideas without
<br>
resorting to attacks.
