<p>Not quite.  People can signal a soft spot in their heart for certain causes
<br>
as long as it looks plausible that the money might be spent on the cause,
<br>
even if a closer examination shows that it doesn't have much effect.
<br>
<p>I sent Mr. Miller the following comments:
<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
I just came across <a href="http://psych.unm.edu/faculty/moral_vision.htm">http://psych.unm.edu/faculty/moral_vision.htm</a>
<br>
and found it to be thought-provoking.  I've long been a big fan
<br>
of your mating mind story, but even so I suspect that your scenario
<br>
is very unlikely to happen.  Let me try to explain why.
<br>
<p>Ethical signaling seems to be mostly about signaling how a person
<br>
will later treat their spouse, children, and other associates.
<br>
People who show a soft spot in their heart for children and needy
<br>
folks around them may be expected to be similarly caring for your
<br>
children if you should mate with them.  People who show themselves
<br>
to resist temptation to keep to their principles may be expected
<br>
to resist cheating on you to keep to their principle of not
<br>
cheating.  And so on.
<br>
<p>The most powerful such signals are *combinations* of resources
<br>
spent with personal context that is expected to trigger ethical
<br>
feelings.  This is why volunteering is such much more popular as
<br>
an ethical signal than investing.  If you spent time at the local
<br>
school, you show both that you give up resources and that you have
<br>
a soft spot in your heart for kids.  If you do a charity jog you
<br>
show both that you give up resources and that you prefer to hang
<br>
around people like you (and that you are healthy).
<br>
<p>Just giving money to an ethical investment, in contrast, says only
<br>
weak things about your personality and how your ethical feelings
<br>
react to your immediate context.  Such investment mainly just shows
<br>
that you will give up resources for some abstract belief.
<br>
<p>While I could imagine a transition to a situation where people spend
<br>
90% of their wealth doing ethical signaling, in that case I think
<br>
most of this would be spent via local volunteering and the like,
<br>
rather than via the elaborate division of labor that ordinary
<br>
investments rely on.  The division of labor is good for production,
<br>
but mostly bad for ethical signaling.
