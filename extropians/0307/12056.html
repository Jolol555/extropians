Hi, it's fnerd, I stumbled across this thread looking for
<br>
something else in the archive, and metafoxes are an old
<br>
hobby-horse of mine...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Since the field is full of rabbits eating grass, good grass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is hard to find, and you can't grow using that strategy.  Eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rabbits, in contrast, seems to allow fast growth.
</em><br>
<p>Grass = interstellar dust, Rabbits = stars &amp; planets?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Accepting your assumptions, a fox that can become a meta-fox is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no more of a threat to any given meta-fox than another meta-fox is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So why doesn't that meta-fox run in and eat any meta-fox it sees
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eating a fox?
</em><br>
<p>My assumption is that a metafox can invisibly eat a fox,
<br>
but trying to eat rabbits (planets) is such a large-scale
<br>
activity that it makes you visible (i.e. a fox).
<br>
I also assume metafoxes are eating matter and/or sunlight,
<br>
just in a low-key way (desultory diet of grass).
<br>
<p>(One point of view on this is that property rights in large
<br>
things that last a long time, are hard to enforce among
<br>
nano things that run really fast.)
<br>
<p>The Q for me is, why *eat* the fox?  If you don't need his
<br>
mass &amp; energy, why cause him to stop growing, or cause him to
<br>
become invisible (meta)?  Why silence him before he's
<br>
advanced enough to be a threat to you?  (Presumably there's
<br>
an arms race and primitive things aren't threatening.)
<br>
<p>One idea is, foxes provide new information useful in your
<br>
war against the other metafoxes, and you want to prevent
<br>
the other metafoxes from getting the information.  So, you
<br>
persuade or corrupt the fox into merger or destruction.
<br>
<p>Another idea is that metafoxes have layered internal
<br>
ecologies, like virus- &amp; bug-ridden protocol stacks, and
<br>
the lowest layers would be susceptible to fox infection,
<br>
so metafoxes' immune systems go after them.  Or, metafoxes
<br>
collectively form an ecosystem and/or culture with
<br>
corruption &amp; succeptibility at all levels.  But then, why
<br>
wouldn't there be places with completely debugged metafoxes not
<br>
susceptible to fox infection?  Wouldn't they outcompete buggy
<br>
metafoxes?  Maybe the answer to that is that internal bugs and
<br>
foxes are pretty much the same problem.  When would you decide
<br>
that you had purged all bugs and it was safe to remove the immune
<br>
system?  After all, a corruption at a high level (like a
<br>
hacker, terrorist or unscrupulous corporation) can install
<br>
bugs at a lower level.  Maybe that's how metafoxes digest
<br>
foxes.
<br>
<p>To summarize something I emailed to Robin privately,
<br>
there's also a question why *we* are still around.
<br>
If we're not ripe for the picking, then there's a
<br>
question why we don't see other civilizations that
<br>
happened to get stuck at the I-Love-Lucy stage,
<br>
broadcasting radio signals but nothing bigger.
<br>
<p>One answer to that is that we are indeed ready to be
<br>
silenced, but that the nearest metafoxes either haven't
<br>
woken up yet, have had to travel some distance to get
<br>
to us, or have started but not finished silencing us.
<br>
<p>Another answer is that I-Love-Lucy's are like having
<br>
fox noises all around when you're hunting for foxes,
<br>
so you silence them to get rid of the distraction.
<br>
