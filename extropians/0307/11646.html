<p>You tell me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, this is a new definition of &quot;free speech&quot; to me.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have to think about it.  I certainly cannot think of any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical parallels now.  Besides, to define a freedom in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of how people *feel* sounds quite peculiar.
</em><br>
<p>I was not redefining &quot;free speech&quot;.  I was talking about people not
<br>
exercising their free speech on this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will maintain that speech is free when people are permitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say anything that they want.  Of course, this implies that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on no moderated list is speech *completely* free, but a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical first approximation is that one is free to say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything whatsoever provided that one is not excessively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaging in personal attacks.
</em><br>
<p>This is my primary goal for this list.  But why the qualifier &quot;excessively&quot;?
<br>
Why can't we avoid personal attacks altogether?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could you tell me who is afraid to speak publicly for fear of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal attacks or other criticism?  (It's not that I expect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you here to betray confidences---perhaps some of these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthies have written some posts, either by name or anonymously?)
</em><br>
<p>As you already guessed, no I won't give you a list of names of people who
<br>
are afraid of being singled out for attack.  That would be counterproductive
<br>
in so many ways.  But why do you want this list?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do you think that the usual list moderators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not up to dealing with the problems that do occasionally arise?
</em><br>
<p>Because they refuse to enforce the rules when they are broken.  They require
<br>
the victim of an attack to go through official channels to report it.
<br>
Complaints on the list are ignored.  The initial ad hominem or insults are
<br>
ignored.  The flame wars are allowed to escalate until the whole list seems
<br>
consumed.  And when someone finally complains, they are attacked even
<br>
further for being a complainer or for only complaining about one side of the
<br>
flame-war.  I think it would be much better to enforce the rules all the
<br>
time for everyone.  Enforcing rules sporadically, selectively, or only
<br>
one-sidedly (if only one side complains) is worse than not enforcing the
<br>
rules at all.  This is the system endorsed by ExI and its current and former
<br>
moderators.  It is a system I have always insisted doesn't work.  Flame wars
<br>
need to be nipped in the bud, not addressed after they are over and only
<br>
sometimes.
