<br>
<p><em>&gt; Logic and reason have as some of their main benefits the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconcile conflicting views.  If people can agree on their premises, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideally, using logic, they can come to agreement on their conclusions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But how can this work with emotions, with instincts?  Suppose I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share the senator's repugnance?  Which of us is right, and which is wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What mechanism can we use to resolve these differences of opinion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S. Another well known example of instinctive moral judgements that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict with those held by many of us is Leon Kass's article, The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wisdom of Repugnance, about his instinctive discomfort with reproductive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.  How can we know who is right, if it's our guts against his?
</em><br>
<p>The answer is, &quot;we cannot know who is right&quot;.
<br>
<p>Here is all we can do.  We can phrase logical and reasonable 
<br>
arguments, but not to *prove* our case.  That cannot be done.
<br>
The aim of our logical and reasonable arguments is to access
<br>
indirectly the emotional and gut instincts of our adversaries.
<br>
<p>Memes (or phrases) play a powerful role.  If our arguments
<br>
can paint a picture that *sounds* reasonable and logical,
<br>
then a crack appears in the resolve of our adversaries.
<br>
&quot;Hmm. Maybe that could be&quot;, will whisper their hearts to
<br>
their minds.
<br>
<p>The only successful outcome to argumentation is that the
<br>
heart of our listener at last lead his mind where we want.
<br>
By the same token, of course, his most reasonable arguments,
<br>
if they're delivered with skill and logic, penetrate our
<br>
own defenses, and we start listening to him, as well we
<br>
should.
<br>
<p>Therefore, in any horrendous matter (like Robert maintained
<br>
and to which Hal in general was addressing himself), we
<br>
should restrict ourselves to logical argument regardless of
<br>
the moral outcry in our hearts.  For it does no good in the
<br>
general case to express mere outrage (and foam at the mouth).
<br>
<p>(To be sure, a lone opponent on a large forum can be, in effect,
<br>
shouted down, but you'll never get to the followers of Kass
<br>
that way.)
<br>
<p>The only good that we can do is paint persuasive pictures,
<br>
never forget that ultimately the heart leads the mind, and
<br>
finally that neither ourselves nor our adversaries will
<br>
reach a decision until the conclusion both feels right and
<br>
sounds right.
