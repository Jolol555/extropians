Sorry for the late reply, but something's been
<br>
boncing some of my email to the list of late, so I
<br>
figured I'd wait for it to pass...

<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:wingcat@pacbell.net?Subject=Re:%20[GKES]%20figuring%20out%20just%20what%20everyone%20is%20here%20is%20doing%20to%20bring%20on%20a%20better%20world">wingcat@pacbell.net</a>
<br>
<p>Activities: Attempting to start businesses developing
<br>
space access, bionics, and other technologies that
<br>
seem likely to enable transhuman lifestyles.
<br>
<p>How to Help: Introductions to angel investors and
<br>
other funding sources willing to look at the profits
<br>
in these technologies are always welcome.  (This is
<br>
as opposed to would-be sources who fundamentally
<br>
believe these technologies are &quot;evil&quot;, or at least
<br>
just plain infeasable, and in either case would not
<br>
wish to pay to develop them.)  Alternately, I am aware
<br>
of more ideas than I have time to implement at once;
<br>
if someone with some knowledge of these fields and of
<br>
business would like a product or a business plan they
<br>
can turn into a business, just ask: I may have one,
<br>
depending on your situation.
