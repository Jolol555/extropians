<p><p>Mike speeks eloquently on many of the problems I feel plague this list
<br>
as well.  To call Mike's criticism of extropians (that they are
<br>
unproductive) unproductive is indeed ironic.  I see in this list the
<br>
largest conglomeration of intelligent people in a single email list I
<br>
have yet come across.  While I don't know what many of you do offline
<br>
(or on) I share Mr. Lorrey's sentiments, that it seems extropians are
<br>
&quot;are about the most non-action-oriented people I've ever met...&quot;  We are
<br>
a vast computer with mostly unused CPU cycles... its a lot of well
<br>
intentioned people hoping a better world comes around, but doing
<br>
absolutely nothing to bring that about.  
<br>
<p>A few weeks back, Harvey noted:
<br>
<p>&quot;My biggest concern right now is that, in general, most Extropians lack
<br>
the scientific expertise or understanding to support the evaluations and
<br>
predictions we make.&quot;  AND &quot;I was among the first subscribers to this
<br>
list at the end of the '80s decade.  Now, I have just turned 40, and I
<br>
am not sure that we are accomplishing anything.&quot;
<br>
<p>Harvey eloquently voiced some of my own concerns, though I would have
<br>
probably labeled them 'annoyances' 'disappointments' instead of fears as
<br>
Harvey politely labeled them, concerns which he later felt were put to
<br>
rest.  His concerns and Mike Lorry's observations are partly the reason
<br>
for my less frequent posting as of late.  It does not seem to me that
<br>
much productive or practical developments come from the discussions on
<br>
this list (given the info I am privy to).  
<br>
<p>This, however, begs the question what is the point of our discussions.
<br>
There is no doubt value in friendly chat with people of similar
<br>
interests, and I don't think every conversation should be held to a
<br>
criteria of 'prove this is beneficial to extropian ideals or cease
<br>
posting'  But conversely, there should be goals identified and worked
<br>
toward as a combined group effort.  I am sure there are a lot of
<br>
individuals doing their own part, but surely the collective intelligence
<br>
of this list has its own unique emergent properties.  
<br>
<p>There has been more chatter on this list about thread titles and
<br>
discussion names then there has been on a real effort to pursue
<br>
technological progression.  I would add to this comment the complaint
<br>
that a lot of the discussions that take place are not important, while
<br>
important discussion often are reacted to negatively.  
<br>
<p>Why might I think Extropians are 'non-action oriented'?  I hope to be
<br>
proven wrong, but in the time I have been on this list I have made
<br>
numerous suggestions, including:
<br>
<p>Recently I read Eliezer &quot;excruciatingly gentle introduction&quot; to a
<br>
complex yet extremely important topic.  I responded suggesting that
<br>
since the extropy list is (probably) full of individuals who are experts
<br>
on something or another, and given that it is important to spread
<br>
scientific and extropian memes, perhaps Extropians should go about
<br>
writing excruciatingly gentle introductions to complex yet important
<br>
topics.  I was going to further add that perhaps a monthly or bi-monthly
<br>
newsletter relaying these 'excruciatingly gentle introductions' would be
<br>
a phenomenal help at spreading extropian memes.  I did not add that
<br>
because, as I suspected would happen, did happen.
<br>
<p>0 replies.  
<br>
<p>Ok, thats fine, but lets talk more about brains the size of jupiter and
<br>
what we would ask god if we came across him, because these things are
<br>
important.
<br>
<p>Previous to that, a few weeks back, I participated in a thread with
<br>
Adrian Tymes, discussing the value of a small implant which would burn
<br>
calories.  Such an implant would a phenomenal and direct representation
<br>
of the good that technology can achieve, and would save millions of
<br>
people-years.  With the 'Obesity' problem touted as the next global
<br>
epidemic in the west, with one foul swoop that problem could be
<br>
eradicated with such an implant.  How many replies did Adrian and I
<br>
receive when we pointed out the collective knowledge on the extropy list
<br>
could likely achieve such a device?
<br>
<p>0 replies.  Ok, Again, maybe not a good idea...
<br>
<p>Previous to that, a thread developed talking about cloning the most
<br>
intelligent people in the world and raising the children in science
<br>
friendly environments, receiving many replies and much discussion.  I
<br>
suggested instead that Extropians just adopt any of the thousands of
<br>
information craved children out there with no good homes and start
<br>
raising some extropian kids.  
<br>
<p>0 replies.  Not even a 'wow, good idea'  (perhaps it just wasn't as
<br>
well)
<br>
<p>Previous to that, I suggested that Extropians make an effort to put
<br>
together an empirical account of historical events, given the immense
<br>
amount of knowledge *and* contradictory opinions on here, there is no
<br>
reason why a concentrated effort by intelligent individuals wouldn't
<br>
result in near perfect objective account of important historical events.
<br>
Considering no such repository exists, it seemed pretty valuable.  But,
<br>
again...
<br>
<p>0 replies.  
<br>
<p>I have requested time and time again that someone take the time to do an
<br>
in depth unbiased historical examination of, say, the cold war, with me
<br>
but have only ever been met with silence.  I have presented examples of
<br>
what I mean when I say a good in depth examination of a historical
<br>
question.  Thankfully there seems a current movement amongst Skeptics to
<br>
partake in just such an effort, spearheaded by Michael Shermers 'Denying
<br>
History' which proved beyond a reasonable doubt using scientific
<br>
methodology that the Holocaust did indeed happen.  Instead people insist
<br>
on holding their existing opinions, and have no interest in challenging
<br>
them or justifying them. 
<br>
<p>There are no doubt a lot of people on this list who know a lot of
<br>
things, and suggesting they are wrong in the face of overwhelming
<br>
evidence is absurd.  I would never, for example, suggest Amara's
<br>
descriptions on the formation of dust clouds is incorrect, however her
<br>
historical account and perception of US involvement in the Afghan
<br>
Invasion certainly was, and I presented a clear, calm, precise argument
<br>
suggesting as much.
<br>
<p>Additionally, just recently, I lamented that the banning of DDT causes
<br>
some 2 - 4million deaths annualy and that since its ban it has caused
<br>
nearly 60 million deaths, putting one Rachel Carson as the top mass
<br>
murderer of all time if you consider people to be morally culpable for
<br>
their opinions being believed.  Can we do something about the DDT ban?
<br>
I don't know, but we can try?  (perhaps the ban is a good idea, and I am
<br>
just ignorant)
<br>
<p>My suggestions on doing something of the DDT ban were ignored and
<br>
instead conversation seemed to focus on the ethics of leaving baby
<br>
mosquitos parentless.  Meanwhile 3 million people die every year.
<br>
<p>Extropians like to talk to talk, but not walk the walk.
<br>
<p>As I said, the deep value I find in the extropy list is that it is
<br>
perhaps the largest collection of intelligent people I have yet found on
<br>
a single list, and I have learned much from it, both refining my own
<br>
ideas, learning new ones, and hopefully helping to refine others ideas.
<br>
Something about the extropy list as it is tends to keep trolls and
<br>
annoying posters who can contribute little intellectually to any of us
<br>
away, and I do not feel it is really necessary to start listing more
<br>
rules and enforcing them, for example, subject line policies.  Are
<br>
things really *that* bad?  or are people just looking for new things to
<br>
complain about, perhaps to keep their mind from thinking about the
<br>
*real* terrible things out there that *should* be dealt with.  
<br>
<p>No doubt that the more rules and regulations that posting receives on
<br>
this list, the less of a free and open exchange of information it
<br>
becomes, and similar more of a waste of a time.  
<br>
<p>Don't worry, I do not suggest that ExI as a group make any official
<br>
movement toward accomplishing something productive, instead I call upon
<br>
individuals to do whatever they can to bring about extropian ideals.
<br>
Lets see some other excruciatingly gentle introductions.  Lets hear some
<br>
proposals to accomplish goals we would all generally agree as
<br>
'extropian' and preferable.  I would offer excruciatingly gentle
<br>
introductions If I could, but I don't consider myself an expert at
<br>
anything yet, but I am working on that.
<br>
<p>More recently, I have been criticized for expressing moral outrage at
<br>
seemingly outrageous moral stances (I know, were all supposed to be
<br>
moral relativists) and condemned for calling someone a communist.  As
<br>
Eliezer (I believe) noted, It is unreasonable to expect a member of this
<br>
list to support such totalitarian regimes, or find them valid, or
<br>
whatever.  And rightly so, however, I pointed out a list member that
<br>
specifically supported such a regime.  No comments were received.  The
<br>
reasons why Eliezer expected no extropians to actually support Saddam is
<br>
the same reason why an extropian should be concerned when another
<br>
extropian claims that a similar oppressive totalitarian regime, a type
<br>
of regime responsible for more death this world has ever seen, is a
<br>
bunch of misunderstood good guys.  
<br>
<p>Instead of being applauded, or even responded to, I was criticized,
<br>
threatened with implied removal from the list and no doubt entered many
<br>
more Kill Files.  Harvey specifically inquired 'Why does it matter if
<br>
someone is an communist'  To which I asked him to show me any ANY
<br>
communist government that has ever supported a SINGLE extropian meme.  A
<br>
planet full of poor, ignorant, starving peasant farmers is NOT
<br>
EXTROPIAN, and NEVER WILL BE.  Thus one should be concern about the
<br>
presence and growth of such a system.  I have noted frequently that
<br>
there are good number of Anarcho Socialists out there.  Ah, but never
<br>
mind that, lets talk about orphaned mosquitoes.  In all of this I have
<br>
also been criticized for talking too much about politics and not enough
<br>
about science!  
<br>
<p>Recently a topic was raised asking what we should do if we had 200
<br>
billion to spend on something.  I was asked this question specifically,
<br>
and planned to answer it in depth, because its implications are
<br>
extremely important.  I did not, however, because I did not feel anyone
<br>
would care what I had to say on it, and the person who asked it had
<br>
already mentioned I was in his Kill file.
<br>
<p>Wondering what we should do with 200 billion dollars requires us to ask
<br>
ourselves what our goals are, what are the primary principles we should
<br>
endorse.
<br>
<p>I would have opined the following:  
<br>
<p>Goals in order of importance
<br>
<p>1) Ensure the continuation of intelligent life
<br>
2) Ensure the continuation of knowledge, technological embrace, and
<br>
information storage and generational transmisal, in other words, ensure
<br>
that intelligent life remains intelligent. 
<br>
3) Work toward developing AI, human life extension, and technologies
<br>
making life more enjoyable. (where these can not be reasonable expected
<br>
to counter 1 or 2)
<br>
Etc...
<br>
<p>A puzzling implication in all of this is whether pockets of extropy
<br>
should be encouraged at the expense of other areas falling into entropy.
<br>
In other words, should we sacrifice part of the world (say, the third
<br>
world) to bring about the singularity in the post industrial west?  I
<br>
think this is an attitude some people on this list embrace, and I have
<br>
read some comments that suggest extropy is a zero sum, that it can only
<br>
grow at the expense of it falling in other areas.  Though I have not
<br>
contemplated this important question in depth yet, I would say I oppose
<br>
its embracing.  There is no guarantee that a singularity will ensure the
<br>
continuation of intelligent life, or intelligence in intelligence
<br>
capable life.
<br>
<p>No goals worked toward should counter goals above it.  Many people on
<br>
this list applaud the coming singularity, but I have seen little
<br>
discussion on what a post singularity world will be like, in fact it
<br>
seems to be considered ignorant to discuss such a topic.  However, it
<br>
seems most people who support such an event are not qualified to judge
<br>
it as being reasonably not expected to counter goals 1 or 2.  There are
<br>
plenty of intelligent people, after all, who care not for the
<br>
continuation of intelligent life, or intelligence in life.  Who is to
<br>
say a super intelligent AI will value 1 or 2?  Unless it can be
<br>
reasonably proved otherwise, goals 1 2 and 3 should still supercede
<br>
bringing about the singularity.  
<br>
<p>This is why I work for the Lifeboat foundation, which is the only
<br>
concentrated effort out there to ensure the continuation of intelligent
<br>
life.  I have seen little mention of it on the extropy list, none that I
<br>
recall that I did not bring up.  Observing this list leads me to the
<br>
conclusion that many extropians take it as blind faith that humanity,
<br>
and intelligent life, will survive, and generally do little to ensure
<br>
that continues.  To them I ask (among other things), what of the Fermi
<br>
paradox?  Where are the rest of the universes intelligent beings?  I
<br>
have still yet to hear any decent counters to the Fermi paradox.  (are
<br>
there any?)  
<br>
<p>If non exist, we should take this as a deep warning.  It leaves only a
<br>
few possibilities, 1) no other intelligent technologically advanced life
<br>
has yet evolved 2) it has evolved but has not made it here 3) it has
<br>
evolved and it tends to destroy itself 4) it has evolved, is here, and
<br>
is undetectable.  Of these options, non particular require any actions
<br>
on our part except for (3), which is the most dire of all.  If they have
<br>
evolved, especially numerous times, and all end up destroying
<br>
themselves, then we must be ready and vigilant or we shall see our own
<br>
demise.  If something lead to their end, it either a) was something they
<br>
could have known of and prevented or B) was unpreventable or
<br>
unpredictable.  Of these, again, only one requires any action on our
<br>
part, (A)
<br>
<p>Where are all the conversations on what could end the existence of
<br>
intelligent life?  The conversations on doing something about those
<br>
threats?  Where is the official extropy support of the Lifeboat
<br>
Foundation, or the Foresight Institute, or SETI, or the effort to
<br>
detect, track, and catalog space debris that might post a threat to us?
<br>
<p>I consider motivation to be a significant variable in all of these.
<br>
Most of the world that isnt busy merely surviving is rather unmotivated.
<br>
If you responded to any of these criticisms thinking 'well, I wish I
<br>
could work on that, but I just don't have the
<br>
knowledge/training/expertise etc'.  I say, get off your butt and get to
<br>
work, pick up a book, read, stop watching TV, etc etc.  
<br>
<p>I currently work nearly 80 hours per week, and feel guilty spending any
<br>
personal time with myself, doing things I enjoy.  My other self says
<br>
'how can you be doing such things when there is so much suffering, the
<br>
only problems that exist in the world are ones no one has tried hard
<br>
enough to solve'  While this daily creates ethical dilemmas for me, I do
<br>
not suggest it should be enforced upon anyone.  It is only the way I
<br>
choose to spend my time that I debate over.  To work as much as I can, I
<br>
consume modafinil regularly to reduce my need for sleep to 2 - 4 hours
<br>
per day, I would take more if I could afford it.  I have written some of
<br>
my experiences with this drug, which all in all are positive.  I want to
<br>
never stop learning, I learn as many new skills as I can, and do what I
<br>
can to achieve my goals with them.  
<br>
<p>This is not a bragging session, far from it, indeed refer to my essay on
<br>
motivation from my web site.  10 years ago I was a pathetic unmotivated
<br>
couch patato, today I am quite the opposite.  I am no genius, I am no
<br>
person born to a sliver spoon (any more than most people on this list
<br>
who enjoy the comforts of the west) I am working my ass off to start my
<br>
own business, which will hopefully be successful and grow into something
<br>
that can support other beneficial technologies, and help me work toward
<br>
my stated goals.

<p>What Should I do with my Life? -

<a href="http://www.matus1976.com/articles/mylife.htm">http://www.matus1976.com/articles/mylife.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Excerpt &quot;In my case, I am working very hard toward developing one of my
<br>
ideas, and the only reason for this is to achieve the ability to develop
<br>
more of them. This is my goal, and this is what makes me happy, and I am
<br>
working very hard to achieve it. I consider any failure on my part to be
<br>
due only to a lack of effort, not one of ability or potential, and I do
<br>
not feel that I am different in this regard from any average human
<br>
being. And if a failure can be attributed to a lack of ability, it is
<br>
only because I did not expend enough energy to develop that ability, not
<br>
because I (or anyone) is fundamentally unable to. To this the author
<br>
says &quot;What should I do with my life? isn't just a productivity issue:
<br>
It's a moral imperative. It's how we hold ourselves accountable to the
<br>
opportunity we're given&quot;

<br>
<p>Excerpt &quot;All, for those who interact with me on a regular basis you will
<br>
likely be familiar with one of my leading projects, mentioned in a
<br>
previous email. For the past two years I have been designing and
<br>
building a motorcycle. I have submitted a provisional patent application
<br>
for a particular aspect of the design, which I am building the full
<br>
vehicle to test. All of this has required hard work and long hours of
<br>
dedicated time consuming effort. I have devoted countless hours to
<br>
studying these subjects and developing my ideas. But dont see this as an
<br>
attempt to impress, instead I want to emphasize that I am an average
<br>
person of average potential. There is nothing I was born with that makes
<br>
me capable of working on this project that others do not have, in fact
<br>
the only thing I want people to recognize when hearing of my efforts is
<br>
that it is something they can accomplish as well, that they see in me
<br>
what they could do if they put the effort into it.&quot;
<br>
<p>In conclusion, if you are an extropian that isnt doing much, get off
<br>
your butt and do something.  You know who you are.  Stop bickering over
<br>
unimportant things.  For the reasons above I have restricted my
<br>
participation in this list, as it seems little productive value will
<br>
come from it.  No doubt my efforts in this post will be considered
<br>
useless and probably either ignored or just add to the size of the kill
<br>
files I all ready grace.  Too bad.  Well, back to work.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
