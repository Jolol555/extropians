<p><em>&gt;Uh, not quite. Firstly, the Free State would refuse to cooperate with
</em><br>
Patriot Act enforcement, since, for example, here in NH we have an
<br>
unfunded mandates law. No government can order another government entity
<br>
to perform some function without funding that function. Therefore, the
<br>
feds can't ask the state or local governments to enforce the Patriot Act
<br>
without funding said enforcement in its entirety.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The feds are actually scared of forcing the issue as well, because they
</em><br>
know that they would lose their case before a structuralist SCOTUS. NH
<br>
regularly tells the feds to take a hike over federal mandates that have
<br>
funding strings attached. We told them to take a hike over seat belts
<br>
and motorcycle helmets, for example. We still get highway funding,
<br>
despite the feds threatening to take it away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In fact, NH only gets 71 cents back of every dollar we send to the feds
</em><br>
in taxes, the lowest of any state. We know we don't need the feds. They
<br>
need us more than we need them, so they never try to force the issue
<br>
because NH is the only state that has a right of revolution and
<br>
secession built into its state constitution. They piss us off enough and
<br>
we are gone. Oh, yeah, and we have the largest gun makers in the US here
<br>
too...
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I *knew* there was a reason why i liked New Hampshire :)
