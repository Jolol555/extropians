<em>&gt;   &gt; Suppose that I suddenly found myself in the year 1936 about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; fifty miles outside Berlin, and I had in my hand a remote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; control switch that would detonate a Hiroshima-sized device
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; in the capital of Germany, and that I knew that this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; be my only chance to kill Hitler and his henchmen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; I would scarcely hesitate, even though it would mean the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; immediate deaths of 100,000 people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1936 you would know that Hitler was a very bad person but the trouble is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would not know that very soon he would cause the death of 30 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people; nor in 1936 would you know if incinerating the German capital would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to something even worse than Hitler by demonstrating to the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9 years early that nuclear weapons are possible and practical. Even today I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, ethical questions like &quot;Would you go back in time and kill Hitler as 
<br>
a five-year-old?&quot; are very much along the lines of &quot;Why don't you buy the 
<br>
winning lottery ticket, 1,5,31,38,47,3, and feed starving children with 
<br>
it?  It would just cost a dollar!  What kind of heartless bastard are 
<br>
you?&quot;  The uncertainty is the *whole point*.  The real question is, &quot;Would 
<br>
you, as a general policy, kill all five-year-olds who had done as much net 
<br>
wrong as the five-year-old Hitler at that point?&quot;
<br>
<p>Despite the plausibility, appealing intuitiveness, and ease of imagination 
<br>
of the story, the protagonist of such a time-travel adventure *is not 
<br>
human* with respect to ethical decisions - that whole mode of existence 
<br>
and choice is alien to our own world of strictly forwards causality.
