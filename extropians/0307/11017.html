### What if you keep removing your brain piece by piece - first the
<br>
occipital cortex (losing the ability to imagine shape and color), then
<br>
parietal cortex (losing the sense of space and location in space), then
<br>
prefrontal and parietal language cortex (losing the stream of
<br>
consciousness), then temporal cortex (losing images of sound), then
<br>
olfactory cortex (losing the imagination of smell), then the insula (losing
<br>
a sense of your body), then..., well, would there be anything left? Even if
<br>
you still have your motor cortex, your prefrontal executive areas, the
<br>
hippocampi and basal ganglia, even the moral reasoning cortex in the frontal
<br>
pole, would there be anything subjectively existent?
<br>
<p>I rather think that &quot;I&quot; is a side effect of certain information flows, maybe
<br>
even atemporal states of mathematical entities. Our particular flavor of
<br>
I-ness depends on the particulars of our brains, but as long as there is
<br>
information processing of some level of complexity, there is a subjective
<br>
experience. As Jeff wrote, something exists, and this is all I can be sure
<br>
of, assuming that nobody asks exactly what is something as opposed to
<br>
everything or nothing, and what it means to exist, or not to exist.
