<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;... most people, asked to make a deliberate choice between

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the tribe, or feel guilty about not doing so ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't disagree that many would feel guilty, but I'm not sure your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implication follows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you misunderstood this point: the claim seems to be that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who chose to betray the tribe would feel guilty *instead* of feeling happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about their decision; this suggests that your two metrics are at odds on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this central fundamental case.
</em><br>
<p>A happiness metric does not require that people be informed about the
<br>
consequences of their choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is the heart of our dispute.  As in discussions of whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upload, or its copy, would &quot;really be you&quot;, there is an element of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definition or choice in looking into a complex contradictory person and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying what their &quot;real&quot; preferences are.  If you aren't going to appeal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to any criteria about why this is a good choice, but just declare it by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definition, then there isn't much more to talk about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is exactly right... which is why I argue that the argument is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical one, and not (per se) an economic one.  I know you'll object
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to that notion, but what the economists are trying to figure out is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something entirely different from what the philosophers are trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;figure out.
</em><br>
<p>I think the idea of a sharp demarcation between these disciplines doesn't
<br>
work here, because this is a topic that both have make contributions to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Certainly the economists should have some input into this question, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they certainly shouldn't get the last word, even if all of the data points
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them squarely at a certain model in particular. ...
</em><br>
<p>Sure, agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As I have argued before, these &quot;dark pictures&quot; of human society for which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eliezer has consistently taken you to task constitute exactly the sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conceptual scheme that any plausible normative component of your theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would argue that we shouldn't endorse to other people, and which, as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussed at length in an earlier thread, we shouldn't believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Your philosophy does not warrant its own assertion; it is not rational to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claim to have it, and it could never be so if it were true. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economic data in the world can and should be cast aside as a merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;useful&quot; model, as it runs afoul with our strongest held ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principles: principles about the ethics of belief and group association.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I argue that, whatever the economic data may show, we'll always be free to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adopt a metaphysical stance about &quot;real&quot; cognitive beliefs that I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call &quot;morally uplifting&quot; and which you might call &quot;self-flattering&quot;. ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The data doesn't show what we should do or say; only our moral convictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can show that.  And, in this case, it seems obvious that anti-realism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the economic data is exactly what's in order here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I morally exhort you to take an anti-realistic stance to the &quot;data&quot; you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been observing and to adopt more conventional metaphysical stance in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hurry.
</em><br>
<p>You say &quot;I argue that ... anti-realism ... is ... in order here&quot; but I don't
<br>
see that you've made an argument here (or even made clear what your position
<br>
consists of).  If the argument is elsewhere, you'll have to give me a more
<br>
specific cite than &quot;an earlier thread.&quot;
