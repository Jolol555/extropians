<p>
It's unfortunate that we find it so difficult to discuss controversial
<br>
subjects without resorting to flaming.  These are issues that people
<br>
have strong feelings about, but rationality demands that the discussion
<br>
occur in objective and intellectual terms, without resorting to emotion
<br>
and personal attacks.  Only in that way can we acquire the best quality
<br>
information to guide our own views, which should be our main goal here.
<br>
<p>I have mostly been able to stay out of these arguments, not really because
<br>
I am above such things, but in most cases because I don't have the strong
<br>
opinions on the matter that others do.  These controversial issues have
<br>
very strong arguments on both sides, which forces me to adopt a middle or
<br>
&quot;undecided&quot; role.
<br>
<p>From my perspective, those who hold strong opinions on these issues are
<br>
mistaken.  They don't really have sufficient grounds to hold the strong
<br>
opinions that they do.  If things were really as clear as the partisans
<br>
think, why would so many intelligent people hold the opposite views?
<br>
That point alone essentially proves to me that the only rational viewpoint
<br>
is to be undecided.
<br>
<p>However, I understand that people do have arguments to justify the claim
<br>
that they are right and so many people are wrong.  Some will claim that
<br>
few truly intelligent people hold the other view.  Others will say that
<br>
those on the other side are simply irrational, affected by emotion,
<br>
prejudice, close-mindedness or wishful thinking, while those on their
<br>
own side are thinking clearly and rationally.
<br>
<p>Ironically, in rejecting such arguments, I am forced to adopt an
<br>
even more radical view, which is that the partisans on both sides are
<br>
behaving irrationally!  In effect, I claim that those in the &quot;undecided&quot;
<br>
middle are the only rational ones, with people on both the right and left
<br>
behaving irrationally.  Then, of course, those on the right will claim
<br>
that the leftists and undecideds are irrational, while those on the left
<br>
will say that it is the rightists and undecideds who are irrational.
<br>
<p>So really, my position is no stronger logically than anyone else's.
<br>
I guess that means I have to doubt my own commitment to the middle.
<br>
Maybe the partisans are right!
<br>
<p>Hal
