<p>I hope no injury was caused when you found 
<br>
yourself. ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; about fifty miles outside Berlin, and I had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my hand a remote control switch that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detonate a Hiroshima-sized device in the capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Germany, and that I knew that this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be my only chance to kill Hitler and his henchmen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would scarcely hesitate, even though it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean the  immediate deaths of 100,000 people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that my knowledge of history makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good enough gamble, and my conscience would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow no other choice.  Perhaps the lives of as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many as 30 million people would be saved by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my intervention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that quite a few readers of this list would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concur.
</em><br>
<p>Not without doing considerably more research into
<br>
my own family history, work records etc. Then
<br>
there is chaos theory and the butterfly effect. In short
<br>
I have some concerns that can be summed up with
<br>
&quot;the grandfather paradox/effect&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So now let's suppose that it's the year 2065, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a historian in what's left of the decimated world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization sadly narrates:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What I will never understand is how the United 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States---the sole, yes *sole* superpower of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early years of this century ---allowed the world-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wide proliferation of nuclear weapons to proceed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Weren't the consequences easily foreseeable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It was in 2003 or 2004 at the latest, that the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best chance was missed.  
</em><br>
<p>To distinguish it from the earlier &quot;best chances&quot;, for
<br>
'maximum uniqueness' :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;After North Korea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtained its nuclear weapons, Japan and Taiwan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  had no choice but to join the club.  The regime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in Seoul in 2009 lit the fuse, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we all know what happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Just think: imagine that somehow the U.S. had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipated that by 2050 there were going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six (6) atomic wars, and that hundreds of millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people were going to perish, and civilization 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very nearly along with it.  Would anyone have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been brave enough to have condoned an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unprovoked attack on North Korea, making it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly clear that proliferation was *not* going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be an option?
</em><br>
<p>Your scenario changes the meaning of the word
<br>
bravery. To entertain it one must assume that 
<br>
consequences are not inevitable so where is the 
<br>
virtue in bravery?
<br>
<p>It also posits that the US &quot;thinks&quot;. The US is a 
<br>
country. Its the President that makes decisions
<br>
like that. President Bush &quot;thinks&quot; more than the 
<br>
US because the US a country does not think at
<br>
all. Some is &gt; zero. In the sense of making 
<br>
*decisions* on go to war or don't go to war. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Probably at the time, no one could have felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confident enough of their logic, not even some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the most clear- thinking Extropians in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually I know one sort of extropian character
<br>
who did feel pretty confident of his logic even 
<br>
*before*  North Korea, back when Bush and
<br>
Chirac were still jostling over whether Iraq should
<br>
be disarmed by force if necessary. This bod posted 
<br>
(and is therefore placed on the record) certain posts
<br>
on game theory, the function of the UN etc in the 
<br>
naive hope of engaging a few good extropic minds
<br>
on the actual problem and thereby ripple effecting 
<br>
out a solution out in appropriate time. But alas, the few 
<br>
good minds were not home, or the one extropic type
<br>
was ignored or deemd to be off his nut or the problem
<br>
was too esoteric or perhaps he was off his nut. 
<br>
<p>The problem being that the UN had no effective
<br>
standard for a go to war no go to war decision and
<br>
that Bush was the only one with the power to take 
<br>
the next extropic step at that time for the UN (but he
<br>
didn't have the wit), did not get sufficently well
<br>
elucidated. So for want of a nail the shoe was lost.
<br>
<p>(BTW:  James Joyce was lazy about grammer too).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And had anyone been able to foretell what is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious to us today, imagine the defamation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would have had to endure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Such an attack would have been almost completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without historical precedent, and so necessarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have struck most people at the time as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supremely evil.  But had they only known!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Almost completely&quot; on the sliding scale of completely :-)
<br>
<p>But then there is this haunting military term &quot;the element
<br>
of surprise&quot; that seems to go back to, hmm, shit the 
<br>
start of recorded military history and tactics. Pre-emption
<br>
was such a well used doctrine that at some points in
<br>
time a few thoughful bods tried to pre-emp that doctrine
<br>
itself and we had a cold war which feature a concept
<br>
called mutually assured destruction. The cold war ironically
<br>
was considerably safer for many than the warmer earlier 
<br>
wars where the doctrine of pre-emption was used. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, as I have said, I personally would not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recommend  that any nation execute an unprovoked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear attack on any other at this time nor in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseeable future--- but I admit the possibility that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could be dead wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I think your right about that possibility Lee but damn
<br>
you *are* very good fun in the way go about it :-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
