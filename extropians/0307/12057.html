<p>Did you read the actual links?  The smalltimes.com only mentions worry about
<br>
nano-pollution specifically.  As for Greenpeace's actual report, I haven't
<br>
read the whole thing (72 pages) but I zoomed in around the &quot;concerns&quot;
<br>
sections.  They're skeptical even of the possibility of grey goo or strong AI.
<br>
Their specific concerns are about nanopollution, nano-divide (the usual
<br>
rich/poor thing), and autonomous but not fully intelligent machines, e.g.
<br>
weapons.  We could call this &quot;concern about premature removal of humans from
<br>
the decision making process, plus worries about liability.&quot;
<br>
<p>They don't seem to call for blanket bans, or even immediate heavy regulation,
<br>
just concern.  All in all what I read seemed moderate.  One could criticize
<br>
their assumption that the poor countries will never develop, and argue about
<br>
whether strong AI is possible, but the nano-pollution concerns seem apropos.
<br>
Asbestos like effects, high-surface area particles absorbing toxic substances
<br>
and carrying them around, etc.  I see nothing Luddite in wanting to see more
<br>
research there.
<br>
<p>Hmm, just thought to read the foreword.  That takes a bit more aggressive
<br>
stance, favorably citing the EU moving toward &quot;no data, no market&quot;, i.e. if
<br>
you haven't studied the toxicology of your new substance you can't sell them.
<br>
That still doesn't seem unreasonable.  And there's concern about AI making it
<br>
easier for people to spied on, whether by corporations or governments.
<br>
<p>I also note that if companies in general committed to taking back their own
<br>
products, taking responsibility for their new products, rather than expecting
<br>
consumers to fill up landfills and water tables, a lot of environmental
<br>
concerns might go away.

<p>Their references aren't complete, since they mention Kurzweil in the text but
<br>
not in the references.  The text also refers to Foresight Institute
<br>
(positively) and Zyvex.  Otherwise they focus more on near-term and obviously
<br>
plausible developments and concerns, not stuff a lot of actual researchers
<br>
themselves find implausible.
