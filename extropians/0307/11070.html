This reproduced result with mice with spinal cord problems
<br>
regaining use of hind legs is promising. But I remember seeing
<br>
advertisements on Australian TV from one of the spinal
<br>
groups about appealing for donations and claiming they were
<br>
targeting throwing away wheel chairs in five years. 
<br>
<p>Less spectacular results are likely to happen somewhat later
<br>
than that. But &quot;the get up and walk&quot; demonstrations of therapies
<br>
traditionally had pretty good PR splash value and this may serve
<br>
as a strong political fillip for Embryonic Stem Cell based therapies
<br>
and research gaining wider community and political acceptance.

Embryonic hope for damaged spines
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-07/ns-ehf070203.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-07/ns-ehf070203.php</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;NERVE cells derived from human embryonic stem cells and 
<br>
transplanted into paralysed rats have enabled the animals to 
<br>
walk again. The findings add to a growing number of studies
<br>
that suggest embryonic stem cells could have a valuable role
<br>
to play in treating spinal injuries. 
<br>
<p>The researchers, whose work was funded by stem cell giant
<br>
Geron of Menlo Park, California, say trials on people could 
<br>
start in just two years. But the first trials are likely to involve 
<br>
patients with recent spinal cord injuries and localised damage.
<br>
Treating people who have been paralysed for years or suffer
<br>
from degenerative nerve diseases would be far more difficult. 
<br>
<p>Ways will also have to be found to prevent people rejecting
<br>
the stem cells. One possible alternative to immunosuppressant
<br>
drugs, Geron president Thomas Okarma told the meeting last
<br>
week, would be to first give patients bone marrow stem cells
<br>
from the same source as the nerve cells. This might trick the 
<br>
patients' immune system into developing tolerance.&quot; 
<br>
<p>etc
