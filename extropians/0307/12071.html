<p>
Robert replies to Barbara's fine raising of the issue of
<br>
&quot;moral codes&quot;, which forces us to examine the utility
<br>
of having principles at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that I'm attempting to force one into a position of doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triage (what lives do I allow to be lost now?) as well as performing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a discount value analysis of the net worth of current vs. future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human lives.
</em><br>
<p>It's interestingly to me what the purposes of having principles
<br>
and codes of conduct are.  One of the purposes is, in fact,
<br>
to prevent one from simply doing triage (or what is another
<br>
name for the same thing, thinking analytically), because
<br>
principles or moral codes represent (an often wise) surrender
<br>
to tradition.
<br>
<p>Let's take an example:  one should never lie about serious
<br>
matters, &quot;Honest is the best policy&quot;.  Why is this a good idea?  
<br>
Why not simply rationally evaluate all the factors of the
<br>
current situation and abide by the logical outcome?
<br>
<p>The reason is that the current version of you is being asked,
<br>
in effect, by previous versions of you and other wise persons
<br>
of the past to act a certain way because it has been shown time
<br>
and time again to be---often amazingly---the best way to act.
<br>
<p>But when you stop to think of it, that is the reason that we
<br>
almost always follow our own rules (say when coding a program
<br>
or writing a sonnet).  Experience has taught us that situations
<br>
are often so complicated that you cannot simply &quot;calculate&quot;
<br>
the answer.
<br>
<p>I say that whether or not to bomb North Korea---as well as 
<br>
any other proposition people on a forum such as this wish
<br>
to discuss---can indeed be rationally discussed, and even
<br>
tentative conclusions decided upon.  But extremely important
<br>
factors to always keep in mind ARE our principles, experience,
<br>
and moral rules.  But none of these automatically provide
<br>
definitive solutions, as some of the people here seem to
<br>
think that they do.
<br>
<p>They should simply be introduced calmly themselves as weighing
<br>
factors.
<br>
<p>Lee
