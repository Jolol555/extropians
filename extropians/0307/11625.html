From: Robert J. Bradbury
<br>
<p>Side note to spike -- while the Atlas-5 launch is all well and good
<br>
would you care to compare its payload capacity to the Energia?...
<br>
<p><p>The Energia carries about 20% more, something like that,
<br>
depending on the fairing configuration and how many
<br>
solids are strapped on.  I am not taking anything away
<br>
from the commies, they do build a fine booster, damn em.
<br>
The 180 is a very beautiful piece of engineering, I
<br>
will cheerfully admit.
<br>
<p>Both Lockheeed and Booeing have teamed with the Ruskies,
<br>
for the success of any business colaboration depends
<br>
upon each team member doing what each does best.  They
<br>
build better launchers, we build better satellites.
<br>
<p>This should come as no surprise, for their economy
<br>
has been more guided from above, whereas ours goes
<br>
wherever the money is.  In the 70s the money was in
<br>
electronics, whereas they kept improving their 
<br>
launchers.  Thats why Intel just sold their billionth
<br>
microprocessor and Boris hasn't yet figured out how to
<br>
make one.  But I will grant they have great launchers 
<br>
and vodka, plus they make those furry hats that look 
<br>
quite competent.
<br>
<p>As a side note to Robert, I perhaps should clarify
<br>
of which company I am speaking when I mention the
<br>
name Booeing, (not just because they were formerly
<br>
located in Seattle, no, mere coincidence, that).  
<br>
Henceforth it shall be known as Booeing, the company
<br>
currently under criminal investigation for the 
<br>
reprehensible theft of highly competition sensitive
<br>
Lockheeed Maartin proprietary documents, or just 
<br>
Booeing TCCUCIFTRTOHCSLMPD for short.
