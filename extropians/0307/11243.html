<p>
Leading Bioethicists to &quot;Debate the Future&quot; in Toronto
<br>
<p>Renowned Canadian bioethicist Margaret Somerville and controversial US 
<br>
bioethicist James Hughes will address genetic engineering, cloning, life 
<br>
extension and nanotechnology during a debate coinciding with the 61st World 
<br>
Science Fiction Convention, held this year in Toronto
<br>
<p>Should we genetically engineer a better human mind and body? Should we use 
<br>
cloning to reproduce? Should we strive for radical life extension? Should we 
<br>
seek the benefits of nanotechnology despite the risks?
<br>
<p>On Friday, August 29, 2003, members of the public can learn more about these 
<br>
issues at &quot;Debating the Future: Bioethics from Science Fiction to Science 
<br>
Fact,&quot; an event organized by Betterhumans that is being held at the J.J.R. 
<br>
MacLeod Auditorium at the University of Toronto. The event coincides with 
<br>
the 61st World Science Fiction Convention, held this year in Toronto.
<br>
<p>The debate will feature Margaret Somerville, the founding director of the 
<br>
Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law at McGill University and the 
<br>
internationally known author of The Ethical Canary: Science, Society and the 
<br>
Human Spirit.
<br>
<p>Somerville will be debating James Hughes, who teaches health policy at 
<br>
Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, is a leading thinker in 
<br>
&quot;transhuman&quot; bioethics and is the author of Cyborg Democracy: Free, Equal 
<br>
and United in the Posthuman World, to be published in 2004.
<br>
<p>Moderating the debate will be journalist Tim Falconer, author of Watchdogs 
<br>
and Gadflies: Activism from Marginal to Mainstream, a book about Canadian 
<br>
activists.
<br>
<p>Tickets to the event are $20 in advance and $25 at the door (all figures 
<br>
Canadian). Attendees will receive an information-packed booklet providing 
<br>
background on each of the issues.
