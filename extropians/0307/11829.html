<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Leonard Hayflick and a number of other prominent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  gerontologists have become so annoyed by the claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of life-extention enthusiasts that they recently prepared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a manifesto. The document - written by Hayflick, S. Jay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Olshansky, and Bruce Carnes and signed by a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  of scientific luminaries, including Robert N. Butler,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Steven Austad, Tom Kirkwood, George Martin, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Carol Greider, and Andrew Weil
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; That's the right document, but the endorsers did not include 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Austad.
</em><br>
<p>Good for Austad! I read his book Why We Age (pub 1997)
<br>
and found it made a lot a sense even to a layman like me.
<br>
It's reassuring to have him on the same (optimistic) side. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They were:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;- flatly asserts that dramatic increases in life span are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  unlikely.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is true, and nearly stopped me signing the document,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it was a relatively isolated statement in an article mainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focused on what we can do today, so I let it go.  The first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draft I saw said &quot;a virtual impossibility &quot;, so I reckoned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'd met half way.....
</em><br>
<p>A Google count on  +&quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot; +&quot;Hayflick&quot;
<br>
threw up 93 hits so I think, given the list of endorsers, this is a
<br>
paper that's impact is likely to be, or already is, quite substantial
<br>
in popular science terms at least. 
<br>
<p>From what I've seen of Hayflick in the media though, I did 
<br>
not think he was leading any charges. From memory, the last
<br>
time I saw him, he was &quot;putting in a good word for dying&quot;
<br>
and (my paraphrasing) &quot;clearing the world of cantankerous
<br>
old codgers&quot;.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The prospects of immortality,&quot; the scientists state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;is no more likely today than it ever has been, and it has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no place in a scientific discourse.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a blatantly misleading quote, because the above 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement appears entirely separately from the discussion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life extension and refers very explicitly to infinite lifespans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than indefinite ones.     
</em><br>
<p>Indefinate and infinite are looking to be important distinctions.
<br>
<p>[Ramez Naam notes in a related post]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why did several very good researchers on aging sign 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onto [&quot;The prospects of immortality&quot;] in SciAm? Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for every person making statements about the future of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human  longevity that are grounded in some sort of plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific comprehension of the field, there are hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are talking nonsense.  Many of those talking nonsense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are making money from it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This drives reasonable scientists in the field nuts, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incents them to put as much distance between themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the &quot;kooks&quot; who are talking about radical life extension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible.  This happens to the extent that reasonable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists substantially understate their true expectations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the field, for fear of being tarred with the &quot;kook&quot; brush.
</em><br>
<p>I've no doubt that some are making money talking and
<br>
selling nonsense but I think that the demand side of the 
<br>
genuine anti-aging market, is unlikely to be shut down 
<br>
simply because a lot of people will try drinking snake oil first
<br>
or have to learn to be smarter consumers whilst picking
<br>
the gum leaves from their teeth. From a business standpoint,
<br>
an unsatisfied customer in the anti-aging market seems very
<br>
likely to remain a prospective customer (whilst still alive)
<br>
in that same anti-aging market. To the consumer I think the
<br>
take home lesson is not going to be 'give up and die' but
<br>
find another product or search for a more reliable vendor.
<br>
<p>The real danger, imo, is that some of the products are so
<br>
bad that the government jumps in with another FDA style
<br>
block to protect fools from themselves. 
<br>
<p>Venture capitalists, if they are worth a damn should be able
<br>
to tell the difference between crap and chocholate, or at least
<br>
the good ones should learn pretty quickly so that the only real
<br>
loosers over the mid to long term are the quacks and charlatans
<br>
themselves. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps, I am not certain of this, but perhaps the quacks and
<br>
charlatans are only shooting down their own personal 
<br>
reputations?  There are still laws against fraud, and 
<br>
mis-representation in most western countries.
<br>
<p>What would be an interesting test would be to see if
<br>
either Michael West or Craig Ventner could *still* raise
<br>
funds, say for something like the Methesulah mouse project.
<br>
<p>The problem in getting a proven fund raisers behind a project
<br>
like the Methesulah mouse project may be that there is no 
<br>
immediate pay off in it for themselves as the project serves
<br>
as a mechanism (albeit an effective one) for raising awareness.
<br>
<p>Seems what is needed is a sort of Bob Geldolf to organise
<br>
a concert and become famous for 'being altruistic' or perhaps a 
<br>
large pharma to step up, put its chin out and say this is a 
<br>
project that indicates our conviction that anti-aging will be
<br>
a legitimate and important direction for us (as a corporate)
<br>
in the future.
<br>
<p>For researchers and academics, the $ prize would probably
<br>
be secondary to the professional kudos anyhow.
