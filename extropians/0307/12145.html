<p><em>&gt;how to think about the unthinkable.  Just as we

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;There is something about the mere possibility of a non-emotional response

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;much the same split, between viewpoints he called Classical

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure what lesson we can draw from this, other than to recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the existence of these two points of view, and to try to respect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other one even if you don't agree with it.  Of course, my whole analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here is completely in the Classical mode, and will therefore tend to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rejected by the Romantics. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually classic vs romantic isn't a divide between affectless reason and
<br>
brainless emotion; each style or mode emphasizes different kinds and
<br>
intensities of reasoning and emotional response. I'm inclined to regard
<br>
both as adoptable styles appropriate to circumstance, although obviously
<br>
every individual with his or her specific temperament and cultural shaping
<br>
is more likely to favor (default to) one pole or the other.
<br>
<p>Because my sharp and immediate reaction to Robert Bradbury's `abstract
<br>
consideration' of a `horrific suggestion' was the first off the block, and
<br>
has been deplored in strong terms by Lee Corbin as nothing better than
<br>
bullying, I should perhaps write a little more about that. What struck me
<br>
instantly, aside from the horror and atrocity of discussing genocidal mass
<br>
murder as a tool of `extropic' policy, was what might be termed the awful
<br>
innocence or context-free character of what Robert proposed for discussion.
<br>
I regarded as blazingly self-evident the dire political and memetic
<br>
sequelae to any genocidal attack of the kind posited. These were later
<br>
spelled out by Emlyn, Anders and Eliezer, none of them notable for their
<br>
drunken Romantic excess and evasion of reason. Quite the reverse.
<br>
<p>But that still misses the deeper point: we might just as easily claim (to
<br>
drag in the Hitler/Stalin/Pol Pot card, which is never more appropriate
<br>
than in a discussion of genocide as an option) that the ExI list is also a
<br>
suitable venue to discuss the desirability of the liquidation of the Jews
<br>
or the homosexuals or the stupid or the Kulaks or the black-skinned or
<br>
indeed the extropians, and all of this, naturally, from a poised and
<br>
cautious classical perspective of &quot;rational debate&quot;. My reply is: the ExI
<br>
list has to be the *last* place to discuss such mad atrocities as if they
<br>
were rational or indeed human options. Such policy suggestions, especially
<br>
on a google-archived list, are *incredibly* dangerous (and odious). 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it certainly *is* the place to discuss rationally topics
<br>
that might give many people goosebumps or the horrors: e.g., what the
<br>
consequences might be if genomic science allows parents early detection of
<br>
embryos with a high likelihood of developing with strong homosexual
<br>
leanings, or autism, or low impulse control, and then aborting them. But
<br>
what about a rational debate on killing such children, when detected, after
<br>
they're born and before the age of 15? I think we're then back again to
<br>
discussing thoughtfully whether the Holocaust might have been a really good
<br>
idea after all. If the ExI list does move in that direction for long, I'll
<br>
not only be out of here, I'll be denouncing it in print.
<br>
<p>But of course, as I believe Robert understands, my comments were not meant
<br>
as `character assassination' or personal abuse. It's a general point, and
<br>
sadly one that has to be repeated from time to time on this list of INTJs.
<br>
I approve of Lee Corbin's dislike of censorship, but he doesn't seem to
<br>
understand that what I (and some others, I think) were complaining about
<br>
wasn't the *voicing* of that detestable genocidal notion, but it's *being
<br>
considered as a rational option in the first place*. Lee will be appalled
<br>
at my saying that, of course, as if I were proposing `thought policing' or
<br>
`thought death'. But Lee and Robert don't seem to realize how pathological
<br>
and unsustainable life would be (how Colombian, perhaps) if we routinely
<br>
and `rationally' considered killing everyone we're frightened of or who
<br>
gets in the way of what we, in our partial ignorance, estimate might be the
<br>
optimal way forward for humankind.
