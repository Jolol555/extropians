As already pointed out by Emlyn, pure mathematics is a terribly important
<br>
thing, and an enabler for most of the technologies which directly impact the
<br>
world. And if it is what you like to do, it is what you should do. Teaching
<br>
is also a terribly important thing as you get the chance to promote a
<br>
rational worldview among younger generations.
<br>
Don't assume, though, that if you study and start working in pure
<br>
mathematics, then you will do that for all your career. I studied
<br>
theoretical and computational physics, and now among my college buddies
<br>
there are material scientists, managers in the public and private sector,
<br>
investment bankers, politicians, writers, ... I do not think any of us works
<br>
in academy as a theoretical physicist!
<br>
I think pure maths gives you a good background and skills at hard thinking,
<br>
then things can develop in many many ways and no door is really closed until
<br>
you are 30 or 35. Luck has its influence as well: being at the right place
<br>
talking with the right person at the right moment.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; can hope to make to the extropian &quot;cause&quot; (if you'll excuse the cult
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; uneducated one. Besides the innumerable benefits of having more smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people around, there's a chance that a few of the thousands of
</em><br>
