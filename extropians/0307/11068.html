<p>Because of regulations put in place to protect him the 
<br>
unskilled worker in the US may not get the *choice* to
<br>
sell their services at price parity with those in third world
<br>
sweat shops. In some labour intensive forms of manufacture
<br>
(perhaps producing Nike shoes) the total cost of production
<br>
is substantially determined by the cost of the unskilled labour
<br>
force.I think car plants and other forms of manufacturing facilities
<br>
are also examples of where the cost of production is 
<br>
substantially determined by the cost of the unskilled labour force
<br>
<p>A multinational can establish its plant wherever it gets the cheapest
<br>
cost of production. Capital can move across national borders
<br>
easily but the US unskilled worker will not find it easy (even if he 
<br>
wanted to) to avoid the oncosts of occupational health and 
<br>
safety regulatons. The US worker is not free, in the free market
<br>
to just up and relocate to the third world country.
<br>
<p>Nor I suspect would you or I want him to have to reduce his
<br>
cost at the price of his health and safety. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; ------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The States will quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rightly in my view insist of safety standards for its workers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this lifts the cost of the workforce. In countries where a injured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worker is essentially just tossed aside for another the labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; force is cheap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Some safety measures reduce overall cost of production. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an injured worker is a lost opportunity - the money invested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his being born, educated, trained, is wasted. 
</em><br>
<p>I think this probably applies more when one is considering something
<br>
less than the global market. 
<br>
<p>In the case of say unskilled labor - manufacturing factory workers,
<br>
the cost of being born in say India and *not* educated or trained
<br>
is likely to be comparatively low. 
<br>
<p>Free world goverments elected on four year cycles are not 
<br>
encouraged to take longer terms views because to do so puts
<br>
them at shorter term disadvantage. Its hard to get elected
<br>
pushing a platform of delayed gratification. And if you succeed
<br>
then there is no guarantee that your government will be there
<br>
to enjoy the benefits of defering benefits. 
<br>
<p>Similarly capital (super funds) looking for the best return on
<br>
investment anywhere in the world where they can find have no
<br>
no reason to get involved in the lifting of human rights outside
<br>
of the nations in which their shareholder live. Indeed to the
<br>
extent they care about such things, or that multinationals make
<br>
their decisions to locate their plants in regions on other than 
<br>
economic bases they do so at a competitive disadvantage which
<br>
is likely to see their financial stakerholder persuing their own best
<br>
interest in the short term switch into less &quot;caring&quot; super funds 
<br>
or multinationals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A safety measure  which reduces overall cost by finding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best balance between safety and economy, is a winning strategy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Countries which toss workers aside will remain poor, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they waste their resources.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah but the west provides most of the capital and the average
<br>
investor in the west that puts their savings into multinationals or
<br>
superfunds that invest in the same are concerned for mazimizing
<br>
return on investment not nation building. It may well be in the
<br>
interests of the capital holding &quot;classes&quot; in the west that some
<br>
countries do remain poor at least in the short to medium term
<br>
and in the absence of political systems that enable politicians 
<br>
to plan for further than four year terms with confidence it is
<br>
very hard for even the free western goverrments to choose 
<br>
the long term smart plays without putting themselves at a short
<br>
term disadvantage in getting elected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The argument of alleged unsafe working practices abroad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that allow the poor countries to compete with the rich ones,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just another protectionist mind-game. The reason why the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chinese can compete with Americans on price is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are ready to work hard for little money, not because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they feel like getting killed for no reason.
</em><br>
<p>I don't doubt that protectionist mind-games play a part but
<br>
I am pretty sure I could find examples of unsafe work practices
<br>
in third world countries that you would consider more than
<br>
alleged. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
