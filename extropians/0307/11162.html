<p>
Has anyone got more hard problems using Bayes' Theorem?
<br>
The ones in my textbooks aren't that challenging, e.g.,
<br>
#2 below.  It was here on this list that the following
<br>
great problems were posted.
<br>
<p>Any more?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
<br>
<p><p>1. It is known that about 1 woman in 100 gets breast cancer.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a woman does have breast cancer, the test detects it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80 percent of the time.  About one time in ten, however,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the test creates a false-positive; that is, someone who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not have breast cancer nonetheless gets a positive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading from the test.  Given that a particular woman has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just scored positive on the test, what is the actual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probability that she has breast cancer?
<br>
<p>2. If there is a burglary on a particular night the probability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is .99 that the burglar alarm will ring.  If there is no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burglary on a particular night the probability is .005 that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the burglar alarm will ring, falsely.  The probability is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.001 that a burglary will occur on a particular night.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the probability that there is a burglary, given
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the alarm just rang? 
<br>
<p>3. The probability that a newborn will have deformities
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;traceable to a sickness of its mother during pregnancy is 1%.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a child is born healthy and normal, the probability that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 10%.  If a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child is born with deformities and it can be traced to some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sickness of the mother, the probability that the mother had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rubella during her pregnancy is 50%. What is the probability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a child will be born with deformities if its mother had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rubella during her pregnancy? 
<br>
<p>4. (and Eliezer's egg problem, which I don't have ready to hand).
<br>
<p>5. A nurse has just started to count the babies in a hospital
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nursery. She has just counted that there are two boys, and has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not counted the girls, when, at 11:00, a new baby is brought
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in to the nursery.  A baby is then selected at random, from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the babies present, to have its footprint taken.  The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selected baby happens to be a boy.  What is the probability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the baby added at 11:00 was a girl?
