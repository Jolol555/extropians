<p><p><em>&gt; Well, the frame dragging phenomenon found in galactic arm structures is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly an indication that gravity propagates at speed of light or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereabouts. On a different note, keep in mind that phenomena like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supernova would not form black holes as they do if gravity did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel in wave fronts at a finite velocity. If gravity propagated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantaneously, then massive stars would just magically turn into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black holes without all the messy explosive effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It is because of observables like this and common sense that give me 
<br>
reservations about instantanious propogation. I did get caught up in the idea and 
<br>
start to get sparks of possible belief when I considered that the speed of light 
<br>
is not an absolute maximum, more a relative maximum. 
<br>
By this I mean that if you are at fixed position and you emit a beam of laser 
<br>
light into space. The light can only travel at the speed of light (duh). Then 
<br>
if that laser is driving a light sail craft which has attained a speed of a 
<br>
quater the speed of light (it has been out there for quite a while). Then the 
<br>
light sail craft can emit a beam of light forwards also at the speed of light. 
<br>
Relative to our fixed position, this beam from the craft will be traveling at 
<br>
1.25 times the speed of light. To us this is an imposible speed, but from the 
<br>
relative viewpoint of the light craft, it doesnt break any laws. 
<br>
Somehow from this simple idea,  I started to imagine that Gravity could 
<br>
propogate in a similar manner. Where gravity waves themselves emit gravity waves or 
<br>
cause them by defleting the space in front of them, ad infinitem. The energy 
<br>
of the secondary waves must have less 'gravitational pull' due to the fact 
<br>
that it must be propogated at the speed of light. This would give rise to an 
<br>
effect where gravity waves expand out from the source at ever increasing speed and 
<br>
ever decreasing strength.
<br>
<p>Like I said previously. It all got a bit much for my head, mainly because of 
<br>
the lack of facts, figures and the holes in the idea. At the end of it all, I 
<br>
was left with a sort of fuzzy feeling that gravity could possibly propogate 
<br>
instantaniously. Which would be very nice, but very very unlikely.
