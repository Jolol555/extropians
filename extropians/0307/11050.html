<p><em>&gt; No idea. But it is crucial to my argument above that I agree that all

</em><br>
<p>### But are you sure that the algorithms are not conscious? Have you asked
<br>
them? (this is not mocking, just pointing out that our conviction about
<br>
other people's being conscious also depends on analysis of behavior).
<br>
<p>I would think that a visual algorithm capable of assigning color to objects
<br>
(i.e. analyzing the visual scene to assign putative reflectances to objects,
<br>
not merely measuring the spectral characteristics of patches of the visual
<br>
scene, like a spectrophotometer would) does have a subjective experience of
<br>
color, indistinguishable from the experience of some parts of our occipital
<br>
cortex (separate from the rest of the brain).

<em>&gt;&gt; I rather think that &quot;I&quot; is a side effect of certain information

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Egan postulated something like this in Permutation City... we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are arrangements of information, and the permutations on the way you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpret physical entities to be arranged are infinite, therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything internally consistent exists somewhere as a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mapping from some piece of reality to the target pattern (although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the mapping would often require more information than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; target pattern embodies).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if you believe this, then identity really disappears in a puff of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic. Why would we even bother with this reality if we always exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the greater platonic pattern space?
</em><br>
<p>### Because &quot;not bothering&quot; results in unpleasant subjective experience.
<br>
Also, what do you mean by &quot;existence&quot;? Minds which do not bother to exist,
<br>
have a smaller measure in this platonic pattern space, which might for some
<br>
other minds be a reason enough to bother.
