Harvey Newstrom said:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I have no more intention of letting ad hominem slide then George Bush has
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; letting terrorists slide.  Letting them get away with it will only
</em><br>
encourage
<br>
<em>&gt; more attacks.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>In some extreme cases I guess it is appropriate to attack someone
<br>
personally, so she or he gets a chance to reevaluate his/her thoughts.
<br>
Whenever it comes to the support of killing people for any cause whatsoever,
<br>
except for oself defense I think I even have the obligation for a personal
<br>
attack.
<br>
<p><p><p>When Robert Bradbury made his sick nuking proposal the other day, he did
<br>
express a monstrous, ultimate example of the ugliness of utilitarian
<br>
philosophy, moral depravity and mega-fascism: wiping out a huge group of
<br>
humans for his beloved fetish, called technological advance. This abhorrent
<br>
example of hubris was based on a blasé academic glass bead game, in which
<br>
R.B. displayed the astonishing abiltity to hijack some free lancing and
<br>
innocent exponential digits from Euler space, hold them as hostages and
<br>
abuse them by rearranging them maliciously for a cracked up point of view,
<br>
Hitler, Goering and Goebbels would have been proud of thinking them up
<br>
as their own original idea.
<br>
<p><p><p>The ad hominem rules might be appropriate most of the time, but they loose
<br>
their effectiveness at the event horizon of black hole thinking desasters
<br>
like the one Mr. Bradbury has proved to be capable of. Here the ad hominem
<br>
protections crumble under the gravity of his comment and are transformed
<br>
into a useless collection of academic placebo pills. With other words: a
<br>
load of bullshit.
<br>
<p><p><p>Returning to cases where ad hominem might be appropriate: transhumanists
<br>
supporting a war of aggression. I know in advance, that I will get a bloody
<br>
nose if I, say, kick some weapons of ass destruction (no misspelling here!)
<br>
into a crowd of proud patriots that represent the majority of the actively
<br>
posting members of this virtual community. But that's okay, I accept it and
<br>
I can live with the bruises. Maybe it has to do with a different kind of
<br>
ironic and sarcastic discussion culture in intellectual German circles where
<br>
no one is surprised if he receives a personal attack for his shitty views.
<br>
Frankly, I am surprised how many puritans and preacher's daughters are
<br>
present on this list and who are ready to faint if someone uses more
<br>
substantial and hearty words without making an affected fuss about it.
<br>
