<em>&gt;&gt; ### Persons of disagreeable disposition (such as you assume this

<em>&gt;&gt; should say, for the crime of not meeting one's parents'

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, then at what age may one ask a child to leave one's house?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, I get it!  :-)  Good one.  You may *ask* all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want!  It is a free country!  It's just that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot *tell* a child to leave.  Haw haw haw!
</em><br>
<p>### On the contrary, since you are the owner of your house, you may demand
<br>
that others leave it, with or without a reason.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here is a true disconnect: I, as a committed non-rebel, cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; grok how when there is nothing important at stake, people can be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; stubborn?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Lee, I cannot fathom the disconnect between your beliefs as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; libertarian, that personal freedom and self-ownership are crucial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unassailable rights, and your willingness to condone the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; egregious breaches of rights, if they happen to be inflicted on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; children. Aside from the infamous &quot;I-word&quot; debate, which was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; somewhat academic, you actually support a real-life example of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sadistic oppression, comparable to the brain-washing of US POW's in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Vietnamese camps (minus the death/bodily harm threat, but offset by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a feeling of total abandonment, having absolutely nobody to turn to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that the humans at Tranquility Bay must feel).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must via an act of imagination transport myself to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenes of coercion, and also suppose that I had been in on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the information and discussions leading up to whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment the parents are dealing out.
</em><br>
<p>### It doesn't take much imagination to see that lying face down on the
<br>
floor for 18 months is coercion.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Randall was quite right to point out how extremely bad are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many parents at raising children.  I would also point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how extremely bad some children are at behaving appropriately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But were I to have this magical knowledge, I have no idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what percentage of the time I would side with the children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But for me to &quot;side&quot; with someone---what comes of it, anyway?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is good to kick the memes around, and I'm all for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that there are any cases *whatsoever* that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would do what these parents are doing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### No, never.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for children's &quot;[legal] rights&quot;, we ought to try some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things and see.  Randall properly retorted that history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can hardly be an infallible guide, so I am all in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of letting some communities enact laws against transporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children against their wills, or against infanticide.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all I care, they may experiment with giving children the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to vote (locally), or giving them the same rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go about the house that the adults have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, normally I would say the same about adults: if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community wants to ban pornography magazines or bibles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it should be their decision, or if they only want to let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black people vote, it's none of my business.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's my belief that history has shown that modern nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially must---if they are to thrive and prosper---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a written commitment to citizens, guaranteeing freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of speech, and the freedom to vote, and that moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;citizen&quot; must be taken to mean *all* adults.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beyond that, by all means let the states and communities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try what they would like.
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, I know. Open season on non-adults.
<br>
