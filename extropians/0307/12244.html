Genocide (n): The systematic and planned extermination of an entire
<br>
national, racial, political, or ethnic group.
<br>
<p>The various defenses of the discussion of genocide are based on arguments
<br>
resembing &quot;we must consider all things, even awful things&quot;. That is well and
<br>
good, but these discussions suck, for a reason to which I will come shortly.
<br>
<p>First, though, we really should put the damned issue to bed. So, here is why
<br>
genocide is an hopeless solution to pretty much any problem.
<br>
<p>To argue about it, I must use a set of values or principles for axioms. I'm
<br>
choosing the extropian principles for this purpose, mainly because they are
<br>
nice and explicit, and really should resonate with list members.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Perpetual Progress -- Indiscriminately killing large numbers of sentients
<br>
just can't be good for progress; it could only be neutral at best. Taking
<br>
away minds can't add. (note: I say *indiscriminate* because choosing
<br>
geography, race, politics or ethnicity as a determinant is so crude that I
<br>
assert it is equivalent to random selection) 
<br>
<p>Self-Transformation -- Genocide can't help here, as far as I can see. It
<br>
tends to interfere with the self transformation desires of the exterminated,
<br>
too (except in the case of the already suicidal I guess).
<br>
<p>Practical Optimism -- Genocide is pretty much the opposite of practical
<br>
optimism. Indiscriminate extermination (even in the hopes of catching a few
<br>
baddies amongst the masses) is more like paranoid pessimism. 
<br>
<p>Intelligent Technology -- This principle is about using technology in
<br>
lateral and creative ways to enhance our goals. Genocide is like killing
<br>
germs with a sledgehammer. Painful, doomed to fail, and stupid. I guess it
<br>
can involve the use of fairly sophisticated technology, though.
<br>
<p>Open Society -- Committing genocide would seem to require a centralisation
<br>
of power that is the opposite of this principle. Further, large centralised
<br>
action to exterminate others is a large part of what open societies were
<br>
created to prevent.
<br>
<p>Self-Direction -- Mega murder, hello? When considering the exterminated,
<br>
most or all of whom are effectively a random sampling of the set of
<br>
sentients (see above), self-direction is being rather rudely interrupted,
<br>
excepting again for the suicidal.
<br>
<p>Rational Thinking -- Only extremely contrived examples could make genocide
<br>
ever look rational. &quot;Thought experiments&quot; like &quot;How about if there were
<br>
zillions of insane aliens like the ones from the movie &quot;Aliens&quot; who want to
<br>
come and eat us all?&quot;. If you look closer, these aren't usually examples of
<br>
genocide, they are examples of war; people that attack you are combatants.
<br>
Genocide, OTOH, is about indiscriminate large scale slaughter. It implies
<br>
massively superior power of the inflictor over the exterminated (of
<br>
course!). Any examples purporting to show justifiable genocide must include
<br>
this position. Also, inclusion of time travel is a no-no, for obvious
<br>
reasons. The position that one genocide might be inflicted to stop another
<br>
worse genocide from occuring is possible, but the burden of proof *must* be
<br>
on the proposer of genocide; this is not a realm where back of the envelope
<br>
calculations can be used for justification. Predicted future genocide just
<br>
doesn't rate anywhere near the same as a real, right now, existing kind of
<br>
genocide.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
On the whole, I think it's very clear that genocide and extropianism map
<br>
over distinct, wildly distant areas of the space of thought. Policy analysis
<br>
markets, there's an idea worthy of extropians. Using nuclear weapons? Forget
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Compared to genocide, even eugenics looks good. Neither work as solutions to
<br>
anything, and they both cause spectacular problems, but at least eugenics is
<br>
a little more subtle (like hitting someone with a brick is more subtle than
<br>
hitting them with a rock). We reject eugenics fully, so why would we
<br>
consider its retarted cousin, genocide?
<br>
<p>So why do I think that genocide sucks? It sucks because it's the stupid
<br>
person's solution. &quot;Kill 'em all and let god sort 'em out&quot; is just dumb. It
<br>
violates all our principles, it makes us look *terrible* to outsiders (and
<br>
to ourselves!), it solves nothing, it screws up everything. Any organisation
<br>
which could commit genocide on others has no individualist ethic and so can
<br>
only be enemy number one for extropians. 
<br>
<p>I think that genocide is probably not defensible in most other consistent
<br>
value frameworks either. For instance, take the patently non-extropian (or
<br>
at least entirely in conflict with the principles) idea that we maximise
<br>
complexity in the universe. It would be extremely difficult to show that
<br>
indiscriminate killing of vast numbers of sentients could increase
<br>
complexity over the long term, compared to what would have occured in the
<br>
absence of the killing (remember to take the social/psychological effects
<br>
into account, this is a _complex_ system you are dealing with). However, it
<br>
is abundantly clear that genocide will decrease complexity considerably, by
<br>
removing large numbers of minds from existence.
<br>
<p>This is a stupid email to have to write. Genocide sucks. We have the whole
<br>
space of wonderful, complex extropian ideas to play in; can we drop this
<br>
moronic crap?
