<p>
Anders' vision has much that is appealing and beautiful.  A living cosmos,
<br>
full of variation and evolution, is far more worthwhile than the mostly
<br>
dead one we apparently have today.
<br>
<p>However, I don't think it is the best we can do.  Life by itself is
<br>
not enough.  Without intelligence and consciousness, life is just a
<br>
set of complex chemical reactions.  This is particulary clear in the
<br>
vision of Europa being colonized by algae living off the (hypothetical)
<br>
deep-sea ocean vents.  If it is like Earth, these environments are not
<br>
well suited for evolution.  They are too small, the energy fluxes are
<br>
limited, the organisms can't move from vent to vent.
<br>
<p>How valuable is it, really, to add an eternally unchanging colony of
<br>
microorganisms to Europa?  How much have we improved the situation?
<br>
Cells are tremendously complex sacks of macromolecules and chemical
<br>
reactions.  But why fill the universe with mindless cells, running their
<br>
chemical reactions?
<br>
<p>If we substituted nanotech &quot;gray goo&quot; engines for the cells, similar
<br>
mindless replicators specialized to some environment, how many people
<br>
would support spreading these mindless engines throughout the universe?
<br>
This transformation eliminates the sentimentality and leaves exposed
<br>
the bare question of the value of replicators without sense or awareness.
<br>
<p>We might suggest that the value of life is in evolution, in creating
<br>
new kinds of life forms and new adaptations.  But even that, frankly,
<br>
can be done better by people than by natural processes.  A large computer
<br>
can create and try out enormously more variety of physical or software
<br>
structures than natural biological processes.  If we want to fill the
<br>
universe with an enormous variety of life forms, the best way to do that
<br>
would be to create them artificially.
<br>
<p>Another problem with evolution, once you get to the point where
<br>
consciousness arises, is its terrible immorality.  Dan Simmons describes
<br>
this eloquently in his book Endymion; the narrator has fallen into the
<br>
sea, separated from his companions, thousands of miles from shore and
<br>
seemingly with no chance of rescue, and is now bleeding and being attacked
<br>
by sharks:
<br>
<p>&quot;Part of my tired mind had been pondering theology during all this - not
<br>
praying, but wondering about a Cosmic God who allowed Its creatures to
<br>
torture each other like this.  How many hominids, mammals and trillions
<br>
of other creatures had spent their last minutes in mortal fear such as
<br>
this, their hearts pounding, their adrenaline coursing through them and
<br>
exhausting them more quickly, their small minds racing in the hopeless
<br>
quest of escape?&quot;
<br>
<p>The process of natural biological evolution is an eternal, ongoing,
<br>
heartless war of predator against prey, with no quarter given or expected.
<br>
Every step forward on the evolutionary ladder is accomplished through
<br>
millions of deaths like the one Endymion faces, filled with terror
<br>
and despair.
<br>
<p>That's evolution.  That's the process which has given us the marvelous
<br>
variety of life, including the greatest gift of all, our own minds.
<br>
We owe our lives, the existence of our species, to the bloodthirsty
<br>
violence which drives evolution.  In a sense, this blood is on our hands,
<br>
in that we are its beneficiaries.  Do we really want to extend and expand
<br>
this process throughout the universe?  To me, that would only compound
<br>
the crime.
<br>
<p>I'd suggest that Anders' vision of life spreading through the universe
<br>
is incomplete.  What is important is not just life, but intelligent
<br>
life, conscious life, life that can enjoy the possibility of growth and
<br>
expansion and improvement.  It almost seemed to me that Anders was taking
<br>
an apologetic perspective with regard to the necessity of intelligence
<br>
in providing the tools for life to spread.  I would instead emphasize
<br>
intelligence as the entire justification for the process.
<br>
<p>Filling the universe with mindless plants and micro-organisms, or with
<br>
animals whose lives are as full of suffering and difficulty as in our
<br>
world, is not a goal that I could endorse.  I am certain that we can do
<br>
better than this, if we have the technology to achieve this goal at all.
<br>
We should do more than attempt to replicate the same basic circumstances
<br>
that have held on Earth for billions of years.
<br>
<p>Our minds are the crowning achievement of natural biological evolution.
<br>
Our goals should ultimately be to fill the universe not with Life,
<br>
but with Mind.  We should transform the entire universe into a cosmos
<br>
full of consciousness.  The universe can be just as alive as in Anders'
<br>
vision, but it will appreciate this precious gift of life and mind,
<br>
rather than simply playing its part mindlessly, as a complex automaton.
<br>
