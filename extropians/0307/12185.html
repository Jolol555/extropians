<br>
<p><em>&gt; One serious but unaddressed problem with building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;free state&quot; in today's world is that the existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states will not let you.
</em><br>
<p>You've pointed out some serious problems.  There are also - I'm not sure
<br>
what to call them - maybe ... impractical problems?
<br>
<p>When I first came to live in Seattle I lived not far from the original &quot;Love
<br>
Family,&quot; who *all* lived in one of the most architecturally ugly buildings
<br>
I've ever seen.  They were like a blast from the past - when buffaloes
<br>
roamed and the sky was not cloudy all day (I mean, they dressed up like
<br>
&quot;pioneers,&quot; you know?).  I used to observe their children - the young ones
<br>
seemed happy enough (in the special way that young ones being naturally
<br>
curious can be), but the adolescents looked sad, restless, stunted, out of
<br>
place ... they looked like they wanted *out.*
<br>
<p>Why am I comparing (irony of ironies) a free state to a cult?  Because I
<br>
keep coming up with all sorts of impracticalities (and many of the them are
<br>
identical).
<br>
<p>Mama, what if your children don't want to grow up to be cowboys?  Papa,
<br>
how'r you gonna keep them down on the free state after they've seen
<br>
Pareeeeeee ...?  What if your sister falls in love with an outsider?  (Say,
<br>
are you even going to let outsiders *in*?)
<br>
<p>Maybe I've just not hung out with gun aficionados enough to understand the
<br>
benefits of a free state, so pardon if my ignorance is showing.  But, in
<br>
trying to sew the troublesome strands together to make it whole, all I come
<br>
up with is ... our dear little albeit imperfect democracy that has made
<br>
great strides in (irony or ironies) the democratic process since its
<br>
inception, and especially in the last few decades.  From the perspective of
<br>
the year 2003 the 1950s - holy Happy Days! - look like the Dark Ages.
<br>
<p>I don't think a free state is ever going to work, boys ... not unless
<br>
something drastic happens, e.g.,  like if we blew ourselves back to the
<br>
Stone Age.  Too impractical, I say (not to mention a few other worrisome
<br>
thoughts crossing my alleged mind from time to time).
