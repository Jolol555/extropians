<p>
In my previous (long) email entitled &quot;Re: How Extropians Live Their Lives
<br>
was: Optimism&quot; I mention some issues of humility, scope, and terminology.
<br>
To add to my comments on the acceptance of genetic engineering, I think
<br>
we'll find, by adopting a certain scope and humility, that there are
<br>
different ways in which we can pursue our goals.  If, for example, we
<br>
consider genetic engineering as something personal, rather than something
<br>
that will alter all living beings, we can counter attacks against it by
<br>
appealing to their *lack* of scope and humility.  In this sense, bioethics
<br>
commissions are attempting no less than to regulate peoples bodies.  While
<br>
we can probably allow a degree of regulation over specific treatments that
<br>
are considered harmful and regulation of standards of treatment, any kind of
<br>
general regulation based on the nature of the treatment, its supposed
<br>
naturalness, is clearly wrong.  It's eugenics.
<br>
<p>The issue here, then, is in making people realise, as I said in my earlier
<br>
email, that genetics is not something occult, we're not &quot;tampering&quot; with
<br>
something static and fundamental.  If we can convince people of this, it
<br>
immediately follows that, because human beings are dynamic systems,
<br>
multiplicities, subject to constant change, intervention isn't something
<br>
abrupt, and, further more, non-intervention isn't so removed from
<br>
intervention.  Non-intervention becomes more obviously a choice, rather than
<br>
the natural scheme of things.  (A great truth we have on our side is that
<br>
problems of genetics are genuine accidents.  They probably have more claim
<br>
to the status of accident than many of the diseases we already treat.)
<br>
There's a huge body of work on the negative aspects of government and social
<br>
regulation of our bodies and what is considered &quot;natural,&quot; in feminist
<br>
theory for example, and we can draw on that.  Also, by moving the issue to a
<br>
more personal level, you can begin to talk about people who are in desperate
<br>
need of intervention without it seeming facile.  If your biggest concern
<br>
appears to be the Glorious Future, wheeling out little Timmy, desperately in
<br>
the need of gene therapy, looks pretty shallow.
<br>
<p>So this is another pratical application of what I'm talking about; an
<br>
extropianism concerned with fidelity to those particular truths science has
<br>
revealed about ourselves and our world and how they interact with our
<br>
current situation, our current culture, rather than an extropianism
<br>
preoccupied with a future or telos.
