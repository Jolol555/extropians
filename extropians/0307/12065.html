From: &quot;Terry W. Colvin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fortean1@mindspring.com?Subject=Re:%20Portrait%20of%20a%20disturbed%20guy%20[Michael%20Moore]">fortean1@mindspring.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Best analysis yet.  This is a remarkably unattractive personality.
</em><br>
<p>###*He's* an unattractive personality?  (More unattractive than the average
<br>
politician or ... who?)  I'm no fan of Moore - but let's face it, if indeed
<br>
he does exaggerate for the effect (and I'm not condoning this), is it any
<br>
less egregious than how much our own administration lies and exaggerates to
<br>
us?  Is Moore's personality any less attractive than Bush's?  I realize you
<br>
did not mention Bush or our present administration, but when I read the
<br>
article imputing how much Moore lies - the comparisons just started to
<br>
&quot;click, click, click ...,&quot; you know?
<br>
<p>###The article stated:
<br>
<p>&quot;Restructuring, aided by waves of computerization, meant wiping out entire
<br>
layers of management, a process that was bloody and sometimes deeply unjust:
<br>
Moore is right that CEOs often compensated themselves royally, while their
<br>
downsized ex-employees worried about buying shoes for their kids.  But the
<br>
fact is that *many* [my italics] industries emerged from the carnage more
<br>
competitive and better equipped to avoid layoffs in future recessions.&quot;
<br>
<p>###&quot;Many&quot; industries, hmmm (I wonder what is meant by &quot;many&quot;?).
<br>
<p>###ITOH, I've read things like:
<br>
<p>&quot;'Executive Excess 2001'&quot; documents a virtual explosion in executive pay
<br>
over the past decade, which jumped a phenomenal 571 percent between 1990 and
<br>
2000. This dramatic increase in CEO compensation dwarfed the increase in
<br>
workers' pay during the same period, which grew by only 37 percent, barely
<br>
surpassing the 32 percent rise in the cost of living due to inflation. CEO
<br>
pay now stands at 531 times the pay of the average US worker. According to
<br>
the study, if the average pay for production workers had grown at the same
<br>
rate since 1990 as it has for CEOs, workers' 2000 annual average earnings
<br>
would have been $120,491, instead of the present $24,668 average.
<br>
As executive salaries soared during the economic boom of the 1990s, millions
<br>
of workers and their families saw their standard of living deteriorate. Over
<br>
the past decade, social programs have been gutted and millions of poor
<br>
people have been thrown off the welfare rolls. According to the Economic
<br>
Policy Institute, 29 percent of working families do not earn a living wage.
<br>
Of these families, 70 percent experience real hardships, such as skipping
<br>
meals or forgoing needed medical care....
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the unchecked greed of these top executives endangers the
<br>
livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers employed by these
<br>
corporations. These workers and their families depend on company paychecks,
<br>
retirement packages, medical and other benefits, which are jeopardized by a
<br>
reckless policy on the part of management that subordinates their economic
<br>
security to the self-aggrandizement of these CEOs. From every
<br>
standpoint-moral, social and economic-this practice is criminal. It
<br>
represents a level of corruption and plundering of resources unparalleled in
<br>
the history of corporate America.&quot;
<br>
<p>###The City-Journal article also stated:
<br>
<p>&quot;So does that mean that Moore's career as the pied piper of union workers is
<br>
also a lie? The best that can be said is . . . not entirely. Moore *appears*
<br>
[italics mine] to give a good deal of money to unions and charities.&quot;
<br>
<p>###Remember, the author did not hesitate to say that &quot;CEOs often compensated
<br>
themselves royally while their downsized ex-employees worried about buying
<br>
shoes for their kids&quot; (even with her biases, she knew better than to write
<br>
something along the lines of &quot;CEOS *appeared* to compensate themselves
<br>
royally).  Yet, when the &quot;greed&quot; card did not come up as (perhaps) the
<br>
author expected or hoped with Moore, she wrote that Moore &quot;appear[ed] to
<br>
give a good deal of money to unions and charities&quot; (i.e., the author's not
<br>
certain Moore really gave money to charities, just that he &quot;appeared&quot; to do
<br>
this - and, well, you know how much the guy lies ... tsk, tsk, tsk).
<br>
<p>Then the author immediately followed that with:  &quot;But on the road he *often*
<br>
[italics mine] stays at the Ritz or Four Seasons, like other movie
<br>
millionaires.&quot;
<br>
<p>There she goes again.  &quot;Often,&quot; hmmm (I wonder what -*if anything*- is meant
<br>
by &quot;often&quot;?)  Maybe the author is imputing that Moore is really no different
<br>
than Ken Lay, Bernie Ebbers, and Dennis Koslowski, the Rigases, Sam Waksal,
<br>
etc.?
<br>
<p>IMHO, this is a far cry from being the &quot;Best analysis yet&quot; on Moore.  If
<br>
integrity were as important to the author as she seemingly expects from the
<br>
subjects about whom she writes, it's not even very good journalism.
