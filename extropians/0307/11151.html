<em>&gt;&gt; Let me get this straight.  You're aware that people who are sent [to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Tranquility] have committed nothing except resisting being told what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to do?  One person was sent here for having the wrong boyfriend.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must hasten to add, again, that there is a huge diversity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases, and that I am choosing to address only the fraction in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which were I to understand the situation much more fully, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathize with the parents.
</em><br>
<p>You appear to be assuming your conclusions. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We agree totally in those cases that the parents would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable to get sympathy from family councilors and experienced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judges of human character.  I hope that you are, as I am,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entertaining the most extreme cases that you can think of.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I was entertaining the cases I thought most likely.  It
<br>
seems to me that kids sent here are more likely to have parents
<br>
that are distracted, impatient, and wealthy than kids who are not.
<br>
Further, I do not necessarily, given the above selection bias,
<br>
believe that those kids are more likely to be &quot;problem children&quot;
<br>
than others of their parental situation.
<br>
<p>That is, I'm more likely to believe bad parenting is the root cause
<br>
than an intrinsically bad kid.  Some kids may, in fact, be harder to
<br>
raise well than most, but I think those kids are more likely to be
<br>
in juvenile prison than at Tranquility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry to repeat---I do grant that you probably acceded to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; request in the previous paragraph. But the custodians are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paid by the parents, so you really mean, 'How stupid could it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the parents...', and I contend that there are cases in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the parents are doing is not unreasonable.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't really mean that. :)  The parents are not without moral or
<br>
ethical guilt, perhaps, but my scorn is mostly reserved for those who
<br>
actually perform actions, rather than those who only condone or request
<br>
that such actions be performed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I would imagine (though I'm not a psychologist or doctor) that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is equivalent to &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot;.  If you allow the process to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; continue to completion, you get a model serf.  If you rescue the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; individual halfway through, you get an angry victim who'd love to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; press charges.  In a free society, rescuing these people halfway
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; through would be a fine business opportunity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So far, you have restricted yourself to criticizing the actions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the parents and their employees, and for that I commend you.  By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, most commenters on your side would be proposing that force be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to prevent parents from taking these steps.  As I hinted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my reply to Eliezer, this induces a great irony: the state may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permitted to apply force, but not the parents.
</em><br>
<p>As an anarchist, I don't agree that the State should be permitted.
<br>
My own principle is that for legal action to be justified, a harmed
<br>
party must be willing to demand restitution.  Therefore, while I'm
<br>
saddened by what happened to most of the ex-inmates of Tranquility,
<br>
I expect that nothing much should be done about it (I assume that the
<br>
brainwashing worked).  My own feeling is that something should be
<br>
done to save the current inmates, insofar as they want to be saved.
<br>
<p>In the current political and legal environment, however, I'm not
<br>
sure that it is possible to do anything about it. :(
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I do not think that you can produce, even considering all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history, an example of a functioning society in which children's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal rights equaled those of adults.
</em><br>
<p>That's okay; someone (dunno who) said recently that history is a
<br>
guide to how far we are, but not a guide for how far we can go.
