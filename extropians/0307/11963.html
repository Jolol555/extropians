<p>Hmmm, spike you need to expand on this somewhat.

All bacteria are carbon scavengers...
<br>
<p><p>Yes of course bacteria scavenge carbon from the

carbon by devouring plant matter.  But what I meant

by archaeo-carbon is that carbon which falls into
<br>
the cycle of peat to bituminous coal to anthracite
<br>
coal to diamond. 
<br>
<p>I would not be surprised if some lifeforms figured
<br>
out how to break down peat, but I know of none which
<br>
can break down bituminous, or the much harder anthracite.

<br>
<p><p>No.  There are thingies living at the bottom
<br>
of the sea which make their living breaking
<br>
down the chemical soup that spews from deep ocean
<br>
vents.
<br>
<p><p>...or the lack of oxygen to oxidize
<br>
the reduced hydrocarbons (for energy sources) --...
<br>
<p><p>Nyet.  There was plenty of life on this planet 
<br>
before there was free molecular oxygen.
<br>
<p><p><p>...iffy premises to base the conclusion of &quot;decline&quot; on...
<br>
<p><p>OK, do let us continue with your objections,
<br>
out of order.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Carbon based life on this planet was already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much in decline before the last few thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years when human started digging coal,  [snip]
</em><br>
<p>...I would question the use of the term &quot;decline&quot;.
<br>
Isn't life always adapting to the resource base
<br>
that is available?  There is no strict requirement
<br>
that we are currently aware of that carbon must be
<br>
the basis for &quot;life&quot;.  While it seems preferable
<br>
proving it would seem to be very difficult...
<br>
<p><p><p>Ah, thank you very much for bringing this up
<br>
Robert.  At this point I shall boldly claim that
<br>
carbon is the only material that is crucial to
<br>
all lifeforms, not just those on this planet.  
<br>
Its chemical properties are unique in so many
<br>
ways, there simply is nothing like carbon, nothing
<br>
at all, not even close, not silicon or anything.
<br>
When I look at my CRC handbook of chemistry and
<br>
physics, and study all the compounds therein,
<br>
over half of them contain carbon, and all the 
<br>
really interesting stuff is organic, with carbon
<br>
making all those wonderful rings and chains of
<br>
all different sizes and shapes.  Carbon really 
<br>
is my very favorite atom.
<br>
<p>So are there any other candidates to be the basis
<br>
of a life form for a carbon starved planet, such 
<br>
as the moon?  First off, forget those elements
<br>
which have only unstable isotopes, since chains
<br>
could not last long if an atom were to transmute.
<br>
Scratch 24 elements, 81 left with at least one
<br>
nonradioactive isotope.
<br>
<p>Five of those are out, the noble gases, not nearly
<br>
reactive enough.  76.
<br>
<p>Metallic bonds tend to form giant molecules but 
<br>
do not lend themselves to the creation of small 
<br>
molecules, which would be necessary for living
<br>
tissue.  Indeed covalent and bonds are critical in
<br>
all life functions we know of.  Fifty eight of 
<br>
the 76 remainders are metals, so we are left with
<br>
18 stable nonmetals.  When I am classifying these
<br>
as non-metals, recall that I mean any material 
<br>
with any non-metallic properties.
<br>
<p>Break em down into classes of those which can form
<br>
one bond, two, three and four:
<br>
<p>1 bond:  hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine.
<br>
<p>2 bonds:  oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium
<br>
<p>3 bonds:  boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony
<br>
<p>4 bonds:  carbon, silicon, germanium, tin.
<br>
<p><p>The single bond atoms are pretty boring in the range
<br>
of stuff they can do.  They form diatomic molecules.
<br>
Thats all.  None are suitable for a basis for life.
<br>
13 left.
<br>
<p>Oxygen doesn't form chains.  Out.  The other two-bond
<br>
elements can form chains and rings, but if they do,
<br>
they use up both of their bonds, so nothing else
<br>
interesting can happen.  So out with sulfur, selenium
<br>
and tellurium based lifeforms.
<br>
<p>Then there were nine.  Nitrogen tends to form super-stable
<br>
diatomic molecules and do little else.  Out.  Of the
<br>
eight remaining elements, only silicon and carbon are truly
<br>
abundant in nature, with phosphorus a very distant third.
<br>
Silicon has a number of interesting properties, but silicon-
<br>
silicon bonds will not form when there is sufficient oxygen
<br>
or hydrogen about, which explains why we see no silicon-
<br>
silicon bonds anywhere in nature.  The others remaining
<br>
on the list are also much more fond of oxygen than they are
<br>
each other, all except good old carbon.
<br>
<p>A carbon-oxygen bond is stronger than a carbon-carbon bond,
<br>
but only slightly, 4 percent.  So carbon *will* burn, if
<br>
heated sufficiently.  Good thing for us.  So carbon will
<br>
as soon form chains and rings with itself.  Carbon is not
<br>
just the best, it really is the only.
<br>
<p>I am deeply indebted to Isaac Asimov for the ideas in
<br>
this analysis.  He wrote an excellent essay on it over thirty
<br>
years ago in Fact and Science Fiction, November 1972.
<br>
<p>Nowthen, we can talk about silicon lifeforms in the sense
<br>
of uploaded minds running on a silicon-based computer,
<br>
but these kinds of lifeforms do not evolve directly from
<br>
non-living matter, but would rely upon carbon based life
<br>
to get them started and perhaps to keep them going.  If
<br>
those carbon-based lifeforms are starved out early by
<br>
the carbon being trapped in coal beds and oil fields
<br>
before those same lifeforms figure out how to release
<br>
it, then it is the end of the road for life on that
<br>
planet.  My claim is there simply is no substitute
<br>
for carbon, no way to evolve around a shortage of it,
<br>
no compensating for its scarcity.  Carbon is the basic
<br>
building block for everything that breathes or 
<br>
photosynthesizes, everywhere in the universe.  
<br>
<p>To me this is the best explanation for the apparent 
<br>
radio silence in the galaxy: that in the overwhelming
<br>
majority of cases, life on nearly every habitable planet 
<br>
comes in and goes out in a few billion years, never 
<br>
figuring out how to either metabolize or burn coal.
<br>
Tech-capable intelligence is evidently a wacky anomaly.
<br>
<p>We made it.  We are the few, the proud.  Everyone wins
<br>
as a result.
