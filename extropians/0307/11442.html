</em><br>
<p>Of course not.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your argument, but I thought
<br>
the claim was: &quot;We can think of two ways of identifying what you'd
<br>
'really' want.  First, we can see if you'd be happier if you got it.
<br>
Second, we can see if you'd choose to get it when they are briefly and
<br>
privately informed.  In the case of betraying the tribe, the person would
<br>
do this if briefly and privately informed.  Therefore, this is what they
<br>
really want.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm claiming, against this: &quot;But it wouldn't, in fact, make them happy.
<br>
That shows that it's not 'really' what they want... not REALLY.&quot;  Or, at
<br>
the very least, that in this fundamental case, the metrics seem to point
<br>
in opposite directions: one seems to claim that this IS what we'd really
<br>
want, because we'd pick it, but another argues that it ISN'T, because,
<br>
whether or not we knew it beforehand, we wouldn't be happy with it after
<br>
the fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;As I have argued before, these &quot;dark pictures&quot; of human society for

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;self-flattering&quot;. ;) The data doesn't show what we should do or say;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;only our moral convictions can show that.  And, in this case, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;obvious that anti-realism about the economic data is exactly what's in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;order here. I morally exhort you to take an anti-realistic stance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the &quot;data&quot; you've been observing and to adopt more conventional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;metaphysical stance in a hurry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You say &quot;I argue that ... anti-realism ... is ... in order here&quot; but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see that you've made an argument here (or even made clear what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your position consists of).  If the argument is elsewhere, you'll have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give me a more specific cite than &quot;an earlier thread.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;earlier thread&quot; in question is the &quot;Should we believe the truth&quot;
<br>
thread.  But I'll clarify my argument here to make it explicit.
<br>
<p>Your argument is that we're self-decieved: we are &quot;really&quot;
<br>
untrustworthy, in the sense that we &quot;really&quot; want things that no one would
<br>
trust us if they knew we wanted them (and that we would act to get them).
<br>
You follow that up with the claim that if individuals become honest to and
<br>
with themselves, they'll suffer serious consequences.
<br>
<p>Any plausible normative corollary to this claim would require that either:
<br>
1 we should cast off our &quot;self-deception&quot; and be honest to ourselves, come
<br>
what may, accepting that we all really want terrible things and that no
<br>
one should be trusted in the ways that they've been pressured to claim, or
<br>
2 we shouldn't believe the truth, as you argued in an earlier thread.
<br>
<p>As you may recall, I argued that 2 was self-contradictory in the &quot;Should
<br>
we believe the truth&quot; thread: the short version of that argument was that
<br>
it was contrary to 2's own normative principles to believe that it was
<br>
true.  So, if it were true, we shouldn't believe it: it would be its own
<br>
first casualty.  I claimed further that 2 was in violation of normative
<br>
logic: that, rather, the truth is what we should believe.  (This is
<br>
because I shouldn't believe that &quot;there is some X such that X is true but
<br>
I shouldn't believe X.&quot;)  I can rehearse this argument at greater length,
<br>
if you like.
<br>
<p>I admit that I was overlooking the possibility that you might be claiming
<br>
1 when I charged you with contradiction...  Of course, I was probably
<br>
overlooking it because I already knew that you thought 2 had a lot of
<br>
merit, and that you were presenting this argument to get us to conclude
<br>
that 2 was, in fact, right.  Turning now to 1, we immediately see that the
<br>
normative argument against accepting 1 is obvious: many bad consequences
<br>
would result, at least in the short term, to any individual who took it
<br>
seriously and ran with it.  Indeed, 1 seems so difficult that it would
<br>
certainly require a very strong argument to convince anyone to act on it;
<br>
I claim that this argument is not at hand.
<br>
<p>Instead of accepting 1 or 2, which are both entailed by your first claim,
<br>
I argue that we should reject that claim entirely, which keeps us from
<br>
having to choose between a dreadful situation and a contradiction.
<br>
<p>I argue that we are free to do this because the claim is philosophical,
<br>
and we are therefore allowed to pick our own metaphysics to suit us.  In
<br>
particular, being anti-realistic about the set of desires D, those which
<br>
the economist seems to find that we have, allows us to act correctly on
<br>
the economic data without believing anything that would lead us to have to
<br>
accept 1 or 2.  We can say, without contradiction, that the economist has
<br>
found a set of things that might be called desires but aren't &quot;really&quot;
<br>
what we desire at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This is exactly right... which is why I argue that the argument is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;philosophical one, and not (per se) an economic one.  I know you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;object to that notion, but what the economists are trying to figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is something entirely different from what the philosophers are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to figure out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the idea of a sharp demarcation between these disciplines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't work here, because this is a topic that both have make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributions to.
</em><br>
<p>Here, you may rightly try to turn my argument on its head:  just as we
<br>
shouldn't let economists get the last say, perhaps we shouldn't let the
<br>
philosophers get the last say either.  Perhaps, but I think I can safely
<br>
argue that the economist's input ends when he tells us which theory is the
<br>
best economic theory; the philosopher's job begins precisely when we are
<br>
deciding whether the best economic theory is &quot;real&quot; or just &quot;useful&quot;.
<br>
You say we can't demarcate these tasks so cleanly, but I think the
<br>
division of labor here is clear and natural.  The economist made his
<br>
contribution by restricting our choices to economically acceptable
<br>
theories: now we put on our philosopher hats to choose whether that theory
<br>
will get the attitude of &quot;realism&quot; or &quot;anti-realism.&quot;  The economist, on
<br>
this point, has no *further* contribution to make.
<br>
<p>As anti-realists, we can reject 1 AND 2: we can claim that we are NOT
<br>
self-decieved, avoiding 1, without believing a falsehood, avoiding 2.  1
<br>
and 2 both look bad.  Why, I ask you, would you want either of those when
<br>
a good and reasonable alternative was available that didn't have these
<br>
dark consequences?
