Good to hear this, I will be watching the list for announcements, btw when
<br>
is the ExI board meeting? I hope you will discuss your master strategy on
<br>
the list then. Here there are many folks who wish to contribute,
<br>
entropically at times and between one flame war and the next.
<br>
Natasha, sorry to hear about your health condition. Statistics say that half
<br>
of us are going to get cancer sooner or later, and examples of successful
<br>
fighting are important to keep going. In the war on cancer, you are a many
<br>
star general.

Subject: RE: ExI list and Positive Directions
<br>
After our board meeting, anything I have in mind will be open to all ExI
<br>
members, and non-members, and anyone can make a suggestion.
<br>
The bottom line is that ExI needs to make a change and I am working on ways
<br>
to ignite the change.  This is not new and certainly has been discussed for
<br>
a couple of years.  Acting too quickly can be as counter-productive as
<br>
acting too slowly.  Whatever changed ExI makes will be for the benefit of
<br>
extropic thinking, and there will be no ulterior motives.  Again, the bottom
<br>
line is that &quot;critical extropic thinking&quot; is the one key element that is
<br>
sorely needed in the world and I believe we are the people to market it.
