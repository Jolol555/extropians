<p>
In the process of investigating some material for a paper I
<br>
ran across a recent report by an European physicist who was
<br>
allowed to visit North Korea.
<br>
<p>Impressions From a Visit to North Korea
<br>
<a href="http://www.inesap.org/bulletin20/bul20art31.htm">http://www.inesap.org/bulletin20/bul20art31.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I found the article educational and a bit different from the
<br>
spin we commonly get on the DPRK in the U.S.
<br>
<p>It raises a quite interesting perspective at the end...
<br>
<p>&quot;Most Westerners, living in affluent conditions, put high value on
<br>
democratic behavior of institutions, on freedom of speech, on human
<br>
rights. People in the DPRK may set priorities differently.&quot;
<br>
<p>As many know, I was soundly beaten down after 911 for suggesting
<br>
that the solution to the problem (of Osama) was to simply to nuke
<br>
Afghanistan on the basis of utilitarian arguments.  I'll simply
<br>
note that nearly 2 years later the U.S. hasn't solved the Osama problem
<br>
and it has probably managed to alienate several 10's of millions
<br>
of people (if not more) by our actions over the last 2 years.
<br>
[In case it isn't clear -- what the U.S. *is* doing doesn't seem
<br>
to be working very well...]
<br>
<p>Obviously given the recent DPRK announcement that they have processed
<br>
more fuel rods for nuclear weapons raises some interesting questions.
<br>
<p>Some that come to my mind are:
<br>
a) How do extropians/transhumanists deal with very strong cultures
<br>
with very non-western priorities?  (Be they through cultural history
<br>
or brain-washing?)  [This relates to the question of how does one
<br>
interface with a culture that &quot;sets priorities differently&quot;.  Is
<br>
one going to &quot;brain-wash&quot; citizens of the DPRK that western perspectives
<br>
are more correct than those they have grown up with their entire lives?]
<br>
<p>b) How does one deal with the entropic issue that the diplomatic
<br>
route may ultimately be extremely wasteful?  Though I'm sure Nick
<br>
will not appreciate my citing his paper in this context, his
<br>
&quot;Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological
<br>
Development&quot; paper
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html">http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html</a>
<br>
helps to shape the discussion.
<br>
<p>The numbers speak for themselves -- 10^14 potential human lives
<br>
per second of delayed interstellar colonization (minimum).
<br>
<p>So lets see,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Afghanistan (pop: 28m), Iraq: (pop: 25m), N. Korea (pop: 22m)
<br>
<p>So we could eliminate the problems distracting us from making
<br>
progress at the cost of &lt; 10^8 lives -- compared with 10^14
<br>
lives *per second* while we keep debating how to resolve the
<br>
problems...
<br>
<p>Ok, I *know* you are going to rake me over the coals again.
<br>
Don't bother (been there done that) -- I'd rather see strong
<br>
arguments that justify a suboptimal extropic vector (perhaps
<br>
one has to sacrifice optimal paths to practical considerations).
<br>
It is just starting to look like each U.S. citizen is on the
<br>
hook for about ~$350 this year for activities in Iraq and
<br>
we already have a huge sunk cost (in nuclear weapons) in
<br>
the means to eliminate that expense (ignoring Afghanistan
<br>
&amp; N. Korea).
