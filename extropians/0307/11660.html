Ah Anders, you raise a host of issues -- probably my fault
<br>
for stirring the pot.

<p>Of course they &quot;thought&quot; they had good causes -- but did they really?
<br>
<p>The Extropians have a set of &quot;principles&quot; (or one might say that the
<br>
WTA might have a general &quot;philosophy&quot; (allowing/promoting the
<br>
development of trans/posthumans)).  The question with principles
<br>
or philosophies may be precisely &quot;where&quot; does one draw the line?
<br>
(We know where various terrorist groups seem to be drawing it...)
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Good causes are plentiful, but they are not worth getting *others*
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ah, so allowing humanity as a whole to be sacrificed for this
<br>
principle is ok???
<br>
<p>(I realize that I'm making some giant steps here...)
<br>
We have...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Sacrifice all of humanity to save a single human life
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(probably not good, considerably entropic)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Know for certain the absolute best path to the most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extropic future (and precisely *who* needs to be sacrificed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in order to achieve that).
<br>
<p>It seems that (a) is the default condition -- without action by
<br>
humans humanity is doomed.  So one has a situation of determing
<br>
actions (by oneself or society) from the perspective of &quot;kill
<br>
them now&quot; or &quot;kill them later&quot; -- it seems most people would
<br>
prefer to stick their heads in the sand (ignore the state of
<br>
the world or entropic/extropic vectors) and put on their
<br>
&quot;kill them later&quot; hat.  Were that not the case I would expect
<br>
to see hundreds of ExI list members demonstrating in the streets
<br>
carrying &quot;Sign Up for Cryonics Now&quot; placards.
<br>
<p>So if one moves towards (b) (trying to be more extropic than
<br>
taking the default &quot;kill them later&quot; position) then one obviously
<br>
gets into a slippery slope position.
<br>
<p>I would assert that it seems likely that there are one or more paths
<br>
between (a) [where we *all* end up dead] and (b) [where we achieve
<br>
an unlikely optima with complete foresight] that are better than
<br>
the path we are now on.
<br>
<p>Blanket claims that &quot;there are no causes worth getting onself
<br>
*or others* killed for&quot; seem insufficient to me.
<br>
<p>That we need &quot;good principles&quot; to guide us is a given.  That is
<br>
part of finding one of the better paths.  It seems reasonable
<br>
in the process of finding a &quot;better path&quot; to look at &quot;whom do
<br>
we save&quot; and &quot;whom do we lose&quot; (back to triage again...).
<br>
<p>One of the reasons that I brought up the topic of Buddhist beliefs
<br>
was that it is relatively non-political at this time but might
<br>
become a topic of significance when one considers future paths
<br>
for humanity and the very different perspectives that Westerners
<br>
(mainly a Christian heritage) and Buddhists have with regard to
<br>
the importance/meaning of &quot;life&quot; itself.
<br>
<p>Robert
