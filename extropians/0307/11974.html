<p><em>&gt; Lee, I respect your opinion
</em><br>
<p>yes, I can tell!  ;-)   No caps!  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; on this but I believe you're missing an important social dynamic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and some stranger yells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at me, it will be counterproductive on their part.
</em><br>
<p>Do you think that it is objectively determinable what is truly
<br>
stupid and despicable?  You make it sound very much as if you
<br>
do.
<br>
<p>If you attempt to rephrase that, I predict that you will have
<br>
notable difficulty in trying to mean the same thing.  There is
<br>
a reason for that.  What you are trying to mean here, is, IMO,
<br>
rather nonsensical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My defenses will go up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a friend of mine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who I respect, mildly tells me that I should reconsider, I may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or may not pay it much heed, or realize just how egregious a statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've made.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the real dynamic is that he perhaps indeed should yell
<br>
at you---because evidently some of his friends are of such
<br>
intolerant dispositions, that his security, safety, privileges,
<br>
or fortune may be impaired if he doesn't learn to keep his 
<br>
mouth shut about some things.  This is, of course, the true
<br>
unconscious message communicated to those we shout down (or
<br>
try to shout down):  Beware---be afraid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a friend of mine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who I respect, reacts with obvious dismay and tells me quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly that what I've just said is dangerous, then I will take note.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Exactly.  Some ideas---alas even here---are just to
<br>
dangerous to speak aloud.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My defenses may rise, but because I trust, like, and admire the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, I will listen.  Most importantly, I will realize that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really an important topic to them, and that I should devote some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to their opinion.  If they had spoken mildly, I might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missed that.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, his primitive fear circuitry would not be aroused.

<p><em>&gt; Many people seem to confuse respecting one's right to free speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to hold certain views with respecting (necessarily) those views.
</em><br>
<p>Well, they could hardly be as confused as your sentence!  ;-)
<br>
Would you clarify and carefully keep the clauses and adjectives
<br>
straight?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the Emperor has no clothes (and looks to be missing some other major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assets), we should not be afraid to say it.   In fact, it's our duty ...
</em><br>
<p>We DEFINITELY should not be afraid to say ANYTHING.  Especially 
<br>
on this list.  Good grief.
<br>
<p>But as for &quot;duty&quot;, I don't quite agree.  Some may feel like not
<br>
taking part in certain debates---and that's okay---so it's not
<br>
quite a duty.  But yes, evil triumphs when good men do nothing.
<br>
And so you may wish to construe it that way, in which case I
<br>
agree.
<br>
<p>Lee
