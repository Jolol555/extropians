<p>SFI Working Paper Abstract  2003 
<br>
<p>Cooperation in Balinese Rice Farming
<br>
<p>Author(s): J. Stephen Lansing and John H. Miller
<br>
<p>Paper #: 03-05-030 
<br>
<p><p>Abstract:
<br>
For centuries Balinese rice farmers have been engaged in cooperative 
<br>
agricultural practices. Without centralized control, farmers have 
<br>
created a carefully coordinated system that allows productive farming in 
<br>
an ecosystem that is rife with water scarcity and the threat of disease 
<br>
and pests. We develop a simple game-theoretic model, inspired by a 
<br>
generation of careful anthropological field work, to provide a compact 
<br>
explanation for many of the most salient features observed in the 
<br>
system. We find that while externalities caused by either water scarcity 
<br>
or pests would, in isolation, be expected to cause a serious failure in 
<br>
the system, the ecology of the rice farming system links these two 
<br>
externalities in such a way that cooperation, rather than chaos, 
<br>
results. We test key features of the model through both natural and 
<br>
computational experiments and a field survey focused on the strategic 
<br>
motivations of the farmers.

<p>Genes that act downstream of DAF-16 to influence the lifespan of 
<br>
Caenorhabditis elegans

<br>
Ageing is a fundamental, unsolved mystery in biology. DAF-16, a 
<br>
FOXO-family transcription factor, influences the rate of ageing of 
<br>
Caenorhabditis elegans in response to insulin/insulin-like growth factor 
<br>
1 (IGF-I) signalling. Using DNA microarray analysis, we have found that 
<br>
DAF-16 affects expression of a set of genes during early adulthood, the 
<br>
time at which this pathway is known to control ageing. Here we find that 
<br>
many of these genes influence the ageing process. The insulin/IGF-I 
<br>
pathway functions cell non-autonomously to regulate lifespan, and our 
<br>
findings suggest that it signals other cells, at least in part, by 
<br>
feedback regulation of an insulin/IGF-I homologue. Furthermore, our 
<br>
findings suggest that the insulin/IGF-I pathway ultimately exerts its 
<br>
effect on lifespan by upregulating a wide variety of genes, including 
<br>
cellular stress-response, antimicrobial and metabolic genes, and by 
<br>
downregulating specific life-shortening genes.

<p>Reversal of age-related learning deficits and brain oxidative stress in 
<br>
mice with superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetics

<br>
<p>Oxidative stress has been implicated in cognitive impairment in both old 
<br>
experimental animals and aged humans. This implication has led to the 
<br>
notion that antioxidant defense mechanisms in the brain are not 
<br>
sufficient to prevent age-related increase in oxidative damage and that 
<br>
dietary intake of a variety of antioxidants might be beneficial for 
<br>
preserving brain function. Here we report a dramatic loss of learning 
<br>
and memory function from 8 to 11 months of age in mice, associated with 
<br>
marked increases in several markers of brain oxidative stress. Chronic 
<br>
systemic administration of two synthetic catalytic scavengers of 
<br>
reactive oxygen species, Eukarion experimental compounds EUK-189 and 
<br>
EUK-207, from 8 to 11 months almost completely reversed cognitive 
<br>
deficits and increase in oxidative stress taking place during this time 
<br>
period in brain. In particular, increase in protein oxidation was 
<br>
completely prevented, whereas increase in lipid peroxidation was 
<br>
decreased by 50%. In addition, we observed a significant negative 
<br>
correlation between contextual fear learning and levels of protein 
<br>
oxidation in brain. These results further support the role of reactive 
<br>
oxygen species in age-related learning impairment and suggest potential 
<br>
clinical applications for synthetic catalytic scavengers of reactive 
<br>
oxygen species.
