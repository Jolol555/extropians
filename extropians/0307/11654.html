<p>I agree with Samantha.  I don't how this idea that people should not defend
<br>
themselves became so popular on this list.  I know it seems easier to just
<br>
ignore problems and hope they'll go away.  But it hardly ever works out that
<br>
way.  
<br>
<p>When someone is attacking or being insulting, keeping quiet just encourages
<br>
them to continue.  When someone is posting rumors they heard, misquoting
<br>
someone else, or posting false stories, keeping quiet just lets the lies
<br>
continue without contradiction.  In fact, during our recent flame-wars many
<br>
of the victims did exactly that.  They dropped off the list, stayed silent,
<br>
or refused to participate.  Instead of quenching the flame war, it escalated
<br>
it as the attackers demanded a response, claimed that the silence was proof
<br>
of guilt, and as they sought out new targets to attack.
<br>
<p>Frankly, the &quot;let is slide&quot; approach doesn't work.  The &quot;do nothing&quot;
<br>
approach accomplishes nothing.  These flame wars didn't stop until ExI
<br>
resurrected the inactive moderation program, appointed a new moderator, and
<br>
announced that the rules were going to be enforced.  Then we saw a change.
<br>
I have no more intention of letting ad hominem slide then George Bush has of
<br>
letting terrorists slide.  Letting them get away with it will only encourage
<br>
more attacks.
