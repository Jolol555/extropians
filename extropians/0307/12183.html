There's also the references used by Arthur Koestler, I
<br>
believe in his &quot;The Act of Creation,&quot; in which he says
<br>
that no one was able to paint realistic clouds until
<br>
someone came up with the system of classification that
<br>
we essentially still use today - cirrus, cumulus, etc.
<br>
- after which all competent artists suddenly were
<br>
allegedly able to paint clouds that appeared real.
<br>
<p>While simple perception of color may not be greatly
<br>
subject to alteration depending upon
<br>
conceptualization, on the other end of the spectrum,
<br>
recognition of logical fallacy certainly seems to fit
<br>
the bill.  I've met people who simply did not
<br>
understand certain basic logical fallacies, even
<br>
though they seemed otherwise normal.  I personally was
<br>
always fascinated by logic, had the good fortune to
<br>
have a really good Euclidian geometry teacher in high
<br>
school, and another HS teacher who introduced me to
<br>
W.W. Fearnside and W. B. Holther's classic &quot;Fallacy:
<br>
The Counterfeit of Argument.&quot;  
<br>
<p>Apparently, some of this got internalized, as I had
<br>
perfect scores on every assignment and test when I
<br>
took logic on the college level, and was able to
<br>
consistently crank out 60-step+ proofs in formal logic
<br>
without any changes or backtracking on tests.
<br>
<p>Somewhere inbetween is where I suspect the truth lies
<br>
about the influence of language on the boundaries of
<br>
thought - or, more likely, the ease and precision of
<br>
thought in various areas.
