</em><br>
<p>Oh, it was even worse than it is now?  I suggested to Robin an FAQ
<br>
answering some of the concerns, er, emotional, people might have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[...]My take on it is that there is
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;[...]it is in competition
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;reactions relative to abstract intellectual reaasoning.
</em><br>
<p>Besides analyzing these as meme sets, we can ask what's right &amp; wrong about
<br>
each.  What are the values of emotional vs. non-emotional thinking?
<br>
In that connection I recommend Antonio Damasio's _Descartes' Error_
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380726475">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0380726475</a>
<br>
<p>Mainly a survey of his own research &amp; theories
<br>
about the role that emotion plays in
<br>
good reasoning.  One interesting line of research is with people
<br>
with brain damage in certain areas related to emotional processing.
<br>
They can solve puzzles or do tasks of a problem-solving sort,
<br>
but fail to manage the big picture of their lives (always getting
<br>
fired, etc.).  They get rude and thoughtless, and have trouble making
<br>
some kinds of judgements that seem fairly straightforward to, er,
<br>
normals.
<br>
<p>(I figure the case for dispassionate thinking is one we're all
<br>
more familiar with.  The ability to make sure brain is engaged
<br>
before putting press release in gear.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure what lesson we can draw from this, other than to recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the existence of these two points of view, and to try to respect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other one even if you don't agree with it.
</em><br>
<p>In retrospect, PR is probably more natural to emotional people.
<br>
