<br>
<p>First a grumble &lt;rant alert&gt; and then a question.
<br>
<p>I do wish some folk would provide a glossary sometimes, particularly
<br>
where they're using old terminology in a very new way, so &quot;new&quot; that it
<br>
hasn't reached the textbooks yet. EG what on earth is a &quot;script
<br>
designer&quot; (someone who designs writing systems or handwriting methods)?
<br>
I've seen &quot;typeface designer&quot; morph in the computer age to &quot;font
<br>
designer&quot; (technically a &quot;Font&quot; is a fixed point version of a &quot;Typeface&quot;
<br>
and in computerese these have become synonyms) but &quot;script designer&quot;
<br>
would involve yet another step away from original meanings. 
<br>
<p>And what was meant by &quot;tracking the graph&quot;; discovering the equations
<br>
between a letterform's Hershey points, or was &quot;graph&quot; short for
<br>
&quot;grapheme&quot; (the smallest graphical unit of a writing system, such as an
<br>
individual letterform) in which case I'd have understood the phrase as
<br>
&quot;charting the graphic chronological morphology of the grapheme&quot; (which
<br>
would technically mean ignoring the phonological morphology)? Which, or
<br>
something else again?
<br>
<p>Likewise the writer spoke of the &quot;fonts&quot; on the objects, what on earth
<br>
were they on about? As fonts are mechanically produced were they taking
<br>
as given that the inscriptions were not done by hand? What did they mean
<br>
by &quot;font&quot;?
<br>
<p>Now my knowledge of typographers' lingo and DTP lingo is up-to-date as
<br>
of my last textbooks (2002 and 2001 respectively) and in their
<br>
terminology the article made no sense at all. I know I'm not too behind
<br>
the times because I've met young Typography students at the local
<br>
university's library and we've understood each other perfectly. Either
<br>
the author is very knowledgeable in a field of which I've never heard of
<br>
and have no insight into, or incredibly ignorant about typography.
<br>
<p>And so full circle back to my original moan; why on earth do folk assume
<br>
that everyone uses terminology in the same way they do? And why don't
<br>
folk provide a glossary of technical terms? (even if they make the first
<br>
assumption a glossary is needed for the  enlightenment of those outside
<br>
the author's specialist field).&lt;grumble, mutter&gt;.
<br>
<p>Now what I Think the author was saying was that the different parts of
<br>
each inscription were exact copies or tracings (hand inscribed) of
<br>
Aramaic computer fonts. Thus showing that the inscriptions were done by
<br>
a person or persons who couldn't make ancient inscriptions without
<br>
reference to a modern source, or had learned their letterforms from a
<br>
modern source, and hence the inconsistencies which had puzzled experts
<br>
in other disciplines? yes/no?
<br>
