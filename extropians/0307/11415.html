<p><em>&gt; it certainly is worth examining, if nothing else for the questions it

</em><br>
<p>So, any ideas for this research program? In what ways can we generate
<br>
gravitons (if working within the particle physics framework)? 
<br>
<p>Me:  For me personally, a thorough examination of gravity from an
<br>
engineering perspective... The first of which is to be
<br>
able to differentiate strong existing stellar gravitational signatures.
<br>
Another would be the effects of gravity in manufacturing
<br>
small-scale structures, or how it affects particularly sensitive physics
<br>
experiments (thus necessitating the development
<br>
of a robust senstive gravity sensor with a quick rebound period
<br>
inbetween sampling). Than there's the really interesting stuff;
<br>
orienting an experiment in a fairly uniform gravitational field, and
<br>
messing around with it using a smaller amplitude (if you will)
<br>
generator and measuring how much you can modulate a large gravitation
<br>
wave with a smaller one (in practice), and see if it matches
<br>
up with current transmitter construction techniques (algorithmically
<br>
speaking)... To be quite honest, there's tons of avenues...
<br>
But before I'ld rush off to do all these things, I'ld like to think of a
<br>
series of specific experiments that cover the (possible)
<br>
analogues between gravity and other phenomena... You know, make sure
<br>
they're either like, or not like... Nail down some concrete facts.
<br>
<p>IMHO, trying to rapidly graph the gravitational forces in play within a
<br>
small plane would be my first attempt...  
<br>
Then add time, and see how the gravitational field changes with respect
<br>
to time :)
<br>
<p>In the GR field framework the issue would be to make strong gravity
<br>
waves without having a large energy tensor. Maybe that can happen if one
<br>
already has a big (complex) gravitational field where small inputs can
<br>
be amplified by tapping energy or curvature already existing in the
<br>
system. IMHO this sounds less unlikely than the previous approach, but 
<br>
still not particularly promising. 
<br>
<p>&lt;grin&gt; see my second post :)  I'm not interested in (at least for this
<br>
project) generating huge amounts of energy; I'm interested in applying
<br>
a small amount of energy at the right point in space, at the right point
<br>
in time... Pretty much the major benefit, and hindrance, is the global
<br>
reach of gravity;  I'ld be extremely interested in say, a directed
<br>
gravitational pulse...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another really interesting question, which just occurred to me, is: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does gravity reflect? are their materials which absorb/rebuff 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravity... or is it all simply a matter of constructive/destructive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference sans reflection?
</em><br>
<p>Static gravity fields do not seem to reflect/refract, but there are
<br>
indeed some weird goings on for dynamic strong fields. Look at
<br>
<a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SCMS/DigLib/text/astro/Gravitational-Wave-B">http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SCMS/DigLib/text/astro/Gravitational-Wave-B</a>
<br>
lack-Hole-Hobill.html
<br>
for example, which shows some nontrivial &quot;refractions&quot; of a gravity 
<br>
wave.
<br>
<p>In general (no no pun intended) you need to learn more about general
<br>
relativity in order to say something constructive about gravity. It is
<br>
not the simple force we usually assume. Check out the links at
<br>
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/relativity.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/relativity.html</a> I especially like Greg
<br>
Egan's tutorial
<br>
<a href="http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/FOUNDATIONS/index.html">http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/FOUNDATIONS/index.html</a> and the
<br>
FAQ at <a href="http://www2.corepower.com:8080/~relfaq/relativity.html">http://www2.corepower.com:8080/~relfaq/relativity.html</a> (which has
<br>
a nice treatment of the speed of gravity issue)
<br>
<p>Me: 
<br>
<p>Grin :)  Agreed [regarding I need to learn alot more] :) 
<br>
I'm hoping to study Physics @ berkeley within a year :)
<br>
A nice long review of the literature being published 
<br>
is in the works...  I'm planning on taking my time to get
<br>
the most out of my degrees.
