<p><em>&gt; Would taking Hitler out at an early age actually have
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  very well have caused an even larger problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; German society was ready for a Hitler when he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came to power. Someone else would have probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filled his shoes and that person may not have made the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake of going into Russia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have to question the validity of preemptive strikes. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To do such a thing suggests that the person conducting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the strike has prior knowledge that the event will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  place. Even if a person had made the decision to attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another country, they could always change their mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right up to the last moment before the first shot is fired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their reasoning may or may not be reasonable, but it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could occur just the same.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; People (be they peasants or presidents) make decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the context of decisions that are made by other people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a very real sense each of us is only free, including 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethically free, within bounds. Consider the pact between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hitler and Stalin over Poland. Is it likely Hitler would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have moved on Poland if he'd thought he'd have to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the Soviets at the same time as the French and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English? One of the decisive factors in Hitlers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberations was Stalin, or more specifically Hitler's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception of Stalin. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way to &quot;know&quot; for sure that the attack was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to actually occur  would be through some kind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of psychic ability. Even then, there would be some kind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of possibility of incorrect interpretation.
</em><br>
<p>That is like saying the only way is magic or a miracle or 
<br>
something that otherwise exists outside the laws of physics
<br>
as we understand it. That is quite a big only. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; When carrying  out a preemptive strike, we are only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weighing possibilities, not realities.
</em><br>
<p>True, but if we don't carry out a preemptive strike (I am
<br>
not talking about NK now but about moral decisions
<br>
generally about *acting* as opposed to not acting or 
<br>
re-acting) then we are also only weighting possibilities
<br>
not realities. We do not have certain knowledge of the
<br>
actions of others only probabilistic knowledge, only our
<br>
judgements.  If it is immoral to act on a presumption that
<br>
is based on ones best judgements made in good faith 
<br>
- then *everything* is immoral and the very concept of 
<br>
morality itself becomes absurd as we ultimately have no
<br>
other recourse than to act on our own judgement.
<br>
<p>Sure we can take advice but the sovereignty to decide,
<br>
the imperative to make moral decisions cannot ultimately
<br>
be shed. Even the advice we choose to take is liable to 
<br>
be biased by our choices. To deny the moral decision is
<br>
simply to decide to let the consequences play out as they
<br>
may. 
<br>
<p>So, in the final analysis I think the individual has no practical
<br>
choice but to follow the maxim to thine own self be true (or 
<br>
the corollary is that to thine own self though shalt have been
<br>
false) and then it shall follow as surely etc etc ...(I presume
<br>
the rest of the quote is known).
<br>
<p>These days the notion of a &quot;self&quot; takes a battering around the 
<br>
edges but not that I can see in any manner that negates the
<br>
essential inevitability that one must make owns own decisons
<br>
or be responsible also for what one has failed to do that was
<br>
within ones power.
