<p>Somehow I don't think that frying millions of people would have been a better

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Obviously given the recent DPRK announcement that they have processed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more fuel rods for nuclear weapons raises some interesting questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some that come to my mind are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) How do extropians/transhumanists deal with very strong cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with very non-western priorities?  (Be they through cultural history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or brain-washing?)  [This relates to the question of how does one

</em><br>
<em>&gt; one going to &quot;brain-wash&quot; citizens of the DPRK that western perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more correct than those they have grown up with their entire lives?]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, N Korea is not exactly a &quot;strong culture&quot;.  The culture and country is a 
<br>
tragic mess.  On the large question though, democracy and free-markets 
<br>
presuppose certain shared understandings imho that simply do not exist in 
<br>
much of the world.  I don't believe attempting to force democracy and 
<br>
free-markets without that foundation will result in much good.  It typically 
<br>
has not in places it has been tried thus far. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) How does one deal with the entropic issue that the diplomatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; route may ultimately be extremely wasteful?  Though I'm sure Nick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not appreciate my citing his paper in this context, his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Development&quot; paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html">http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helps to shape the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think that running over other cultures and peoples in a rush to 
<br>
increase technological development is particularly moral or safe.  I think it 
<br>
leads to a very unstable world situation and a lot of diversion of resources 
<br>
to fight and defend against such instabilties.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The numbers speak for themselves -- 10^14 potential human lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per second of delayed interstellar colonization (minimum).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We are talling &quot;potential human lives&quot; here?   Sheesh.   Some of the 
<br>
anti-abortion folks must be thrilled.   It is bizarre to me to talk about 
<br>
some spacious number of hypothetical human (?) lives depending on 
<br>
interstellar colonization (?!) when we seem all too willing to ignore 
<br>
hundreds of millions who are living lives of great misery right in our own 
<br>
backyard right here and now.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So lets see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Afghanistan (pop: 28m), Iraq: (pop: 25m), N. Korea (pop: 22m)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we could eliminate the problems distracting us from making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress at the cost of &lt; 10^8 lives -- compared with 10^14
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives *per second* while we keep debating how to resolve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am sorry to see that you have not apparently learned just how monstrous this 
<br>
type of thinking is and continues to be.   Every bloody tyrant in history has 
<br>
claimed a glorious future absolved him from responsibility for mass 
<br>
slaughter.   I will be very sorry if you are at least hypothetically in their 
<br>
camp.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok, I *know* you are going to rake me over the coals again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't bother (been there done that) -- I'd rather see strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that justify a suboptimal extropic vector (perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has to sacrifice optimal paths to practical considerations).
</em><br>
<p>Optimal must be defined in terms of what is, not what may be if there is to be 
<br>
any sort of optimal path from *here* to any *there* we might dream of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is just starting to look like each U.S. citizen is on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hook for about ~$350 this year for activities in Iraq and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we already have a huge sunk cost (in nuclear weapons) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the means to eliminate that expense (ignoring Afghanistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; N. Korea).
</em><br>
<p>There is an easy solution.  Get the hell out of Iraq and don't do anything 
<br>
that idiotic again.   Spend the same dollars toward making the world actually 
<br>
work for its people and perhaps we can come to less dark hearted solutions.
