<em>&gt;Subject: RE: push your bike, risk a beating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From: Karen Rand Smigrodzki
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;From: &quot;Spike&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ja, and I wish someone could explain to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why it is that riding a motorcycle causes all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; women in view to appear more attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...I know many women personally who are attracted to motorcycle riding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;men; those same women tend to be the ones that are turned on by &quot;bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boy&quot; types...
</em><br>
<p>I think it's more of a case of us just simply being utter bad boy studs, 
<br>
really...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure however motorcyclist as bad boy is somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outdated. Or is it? Seems like a lot of pro-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;establishment proles (like me) ride motorcycles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these days.
</em><br>
<p>The motorcycle (and the scooter, of course) are working mens' 
<br>
machines.  Perhaps since the rider doesn't have a car, the woman 
<br>
subconciously realizes that he's poorly paid.  Therefore her ancient lizard 
<br>
brain figures that he has to supplement his food by hunting wild animals 
<br>
with nothing more than a 230ft/lb torque wrench for a club and some 
<br>
aggressive driving.  This of course would be irresistable to any woman in 
<br>
her right mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I was thinking of how the genome somehow influences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the organism to seek out healthy mates, explaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why peahens are attracted to the big brightly colored
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tails, which imply robust health. If one is too old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or too creaky, one generally chooses other means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transportation than bikes. Motorcycling requires a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher level of alertness, balance and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strength, if one wishes to survive long at it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So motorcycling implies healthy rider, which results
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the female passers-by look at the rider with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;little more warmth, smiling and posturing in a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attractive way?
</em><br>
<p>I'll go for that.  Sounds a whole lot less barmy than my idea.
<br>
<p>I have another theory also.  The vibrations set up by the throbbing (oohh) 
<br>
of a single or twin cylinder engine (not triples though, eugh) just happen 
<br>
to be at the resonant frequency of the parts of the brain that control 
<br>
arousal and attraction.
<br>
<p>Either that or it's the brain-numbing effects of the exhaust fumes.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;...Why one would feel increased desire while riding may in part be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(some of) the physical and visual stimulation you suggested. I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also suggest that it is in part the effect of knowing that women who see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you on a bike will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(often) find you more desirable (as the bad boy); it is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commonly known that knowing someone desires you can cause you yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to become aroused. Very helpful for procreation. If you could convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself that everyone who saw you riding was extremely turned off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sexually by you, do you think that you would have the same increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desire? --karen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, Karen, perhaps you are right, however deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down I fully realize that even on the fastest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coolest bike, I am still a pencil-necked geek. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real explanation may be as simple as this: when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;am riding I am having fun. Fun is inextricably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;linked to copulation. Ergo, all females within
</em><br>
<em>&gt;visual range get a free half a standard deviation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;added to their attractiveness.
</em><br>
<p>I prefer the &quot;bad boy&quot; story, myself:)  Now where'd I put that strap on 
<br>
holster for my Remmy.....
<br>
<p><p>James...
