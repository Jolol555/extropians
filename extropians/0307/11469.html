<p>### Actually, the idea is something different - it is not supposed to be a
<br>
fee imposed by a monopolist like the post office, or even a service
<br>
provider. Instead, every email user might have the option in his email
<br>
program to demand a &quot;delivery fee&quot; to be paid to him, in advance, by the
<br>
sender, for the privilege of the sender's message actually showing up in the
<br>
inbox. Since you, the receiver, imposed the fee, you can waive it for people
<br>
you trust, so you still exchange email almost for free with friends.
<br>
Occasionally you might have to pay a fee to reach somebody who doesn't know
<br>
you (but if he is a nice person, he would return your fee after seeing you
<br>
are not a spammer or a troll).
<br>
<p>Aside from controlling spam, there would be additional benefits. Depending
<br>
on how high you judge the value of your time, you could demand a higher
<br>
delivery fee, and if people really want to communicate with you, they will
<br>
pay. On the other hand, persons who are not judged important, will need to
<br>
keep their fees low, if they want anybody to talk to them at all. A
<br>
beautiful, self-governing free market system, rewarding nice and smart
<br>
people, and automatically suppressing boring and bothersome rants.
