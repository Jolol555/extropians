</em><br>
<p>Rights are not dependent on the Geneva Convention and I don't think it 
<br>
actually has anything on such a category as &quot;illegal combatant&quot; anyway.  The 
<br>
founders of America were &quot;illegal combatants&quot; by the lights of the official 
<br>
government of the day.  Did they have no rights?     Do revolutionaries have 
<br>
no rights?  Do they somehow only get rights when/if they win?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They can be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, they cannot.  Read your Constitution.  It does not establish some special 
<br>
category such as this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;These are not innocent men in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gitmo's prison. They are killers who refuse to wear a uniform, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack civilians and torture innocents. They refuse to operate by the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws of war, they will be tried outside the civilian court system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their crime is not a civil crime, it is a military one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Look, we have an Attorney General who would happily declare people who merely 
<br>
demonstrate or support some group that is later (again without due process) 
<br>
termed a terrorist organization or supporter to be illegal combatants and 
<br>
lose their rights of citizenship.   This without due process of any kind on 
<br>
government's whim.  Do you believe that is at all compatible with any sort of 
<br>
Free State or free people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have several times asked people to read the Geneva Conventions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please do not make any more unsupported claims about such things until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The founders did not put their ass on the line in order to be stripped of all 
<br>
rights on some bogus interpretation of the Geneva Convention.
