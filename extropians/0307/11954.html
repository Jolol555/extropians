<em>&gt; Ciao,

<p>I thought about this very problem years ago when I was working as a machine 
<br>
setter. I saw many people made redundant, when there positions were taken by 
<br>
bigger, better more cost effective machines. Luckily for me, I was a setter and 
<br>
also as multiskilled as I could possibly be. So I was simply moved around to 
<br>
service the new machines and run whatever old manual pieces of hardware that 
<br>
were left. That was until the entire factory was shut down and replaced by a new 
<br>
one half way around the world, run by a far cheaper workforce.
<br>
Back then I spent many hours sitting and watching the machines, tirelessly 
<br>
milling, turning and grinding away. 90% of my working day involved just sitting 
<br>
and watching in case something went wrong or the metal masters needed feeding. 
<br>
In one eight hour shift, I would watch six machines turn out tens of 
<br>
thousands of components. I often wondered how many people it would have taken to 
<br>
produce the same in years gone by.
<br>
It forced me to think about what my future had in store and the direction 
<br>
manufacturing was taking. 
<br>
It didnt take much to realise that the only people in the future that would 
<br>
have a job, would be the people that owned the machines. In that, I saw one 
<br>
possible solution for the average Joe worker.
<br>
If Joe owned a machine. He could supply the services of said machine to a 
<br>
company, rather than his sevices directly. In addition to this, he would be 
<br>
responsible for the maintenance and running of the machine. The company pays for 
<br>
either the hours the machine runs or the amount of work done, for example the 
<br>
quantity of units produced.
<br>
<p>This may seem like a stupid idea at first and very difficult to manage. 
<br>
However it isn't very far from the system that is already in place in many 
<br>
factories. The machines are rented from one company, The workers stand around watching 
<br>
and feeding and they are also payed a productivity bonus.
<br>
<p>I never did work out the nitty gritty of this system where the workers own 
<br>
the machines as I left manufacturing and became an IT consultant. Which 
<br>
irronically has placed me in a very similar position.
<br>
