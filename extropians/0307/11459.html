<p>
This thread seems to have bogged down into a largely fruitless discussion 
<br>
of what the word &quot;want&quot; should mean, and a potentially fruitful but slow 
<br>
discussion of whether it is good (or right) to give people what they want 
<br>
or what they say they want.  Let me try a different approach and ask: what 
<br>
are the prospects for ending, or at least greatly reducing, hypocrisy?
<br>
<p>Humans seem to have evolved so that most people espouse &quot;high&quot; ideals while 
<br>
their inclination to actually follow those ideals is primarily driven by 
<br>
social pressure.  People self-deceive enough so that they usually do no see 
<br>
the conflicts between their ideals and their actions.  Others are better 
<br>
able to see through such deception, and may or may not use that as a basis 
<br>
of social pressure.  Some people have less hypocrisy, either by raising 
<br>
their actions to their ideals, or lowering their ideals to their actions, 
<br>
but these are a clear minority.  And the ideals of some are not the ideals 
<br>
of others; for example, some hold ideals of racial or cultural purity, 
<br>
uncompromising revenge against longtime enemies, or the restoration of a 
<br>
human-free nature.  (Ideals seem to be less consistent than, and to vary 
<br>
more than, actions.)
<br>
<p>Three questions come to mind:
<br>
1) To what extent might we expect humans or their descendants to reduce 
<br>
their hypocrisy?
<br>
2) If they do, in which direction will the resolution be, toward current 
<br>
ideals or actions?
<br>
3) Will such a reduction in hypocrisy be a good thing?
<br>
<p>One approach to reducing hypocrisy is preaching, i.e., pointing out to 
<br>
people how their actions fall short of their ideals.  This seems to have 
<br>
mostly played itself out; preaching has been long tried and our ability to 
<br>
self-deceive seems robust against it.  Perhaps such preaching will be more 
<br>
effective when aided by more detailed descriptions of how evolution helps 
<br>
us to self-deceive, but I see little evidence of this in the behavior of 
<br>
those who best understand evolutionary psychology and self-deception.  The 
<br>
jury is still out here though.
<br>
<p>Another approach to reducing hypocrisy is social pressure enhanced by more 
<br>
transparency.  Our tendency to hypocrisy evolved in small tribes where 
<br>
transparency is far higher than in our modern society.  But perhaps a 
<br>
future society will be even more transparent, for example letting us see 
<br>
each other's thoughts.  However, it is not clear that social pressure 
<br>
always reduces self-deception and hypocrisy; on some issues it may well 
<br>
increase hypocrisy.
<br>
<p>A third approach to reducing hypocrisy is a more totalitarian 
<br>
democracy.  Democracy seems to induce people to vote their ideals, since 
<br>
there are almost no other personal consequences of your vote besides how 
<br>
that vote modifies your self-image.  So the more kinds of behavior are 
<br>
dictated by a totalitarian democracy, the more such behavior might be 
<br>
dictated by shared ideals. This tendency might be restrained by 
<br>
international competition, if some ideals make nations lose such 
<br>
competition, but democratic world government might be less restrained.
