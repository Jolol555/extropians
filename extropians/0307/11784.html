<p>
Like the title says, what are we doing to bring on a better, more extropic
<br>
world? This will be condensed into a living document kept fresh and happy by
<br>
the GKES. I'll make a suggestion for the document format, add my
<br>
contribution to it, and then name some names and make wild guesses as to
<br>
what they're doing out there in the real world in order to provoke them into
<br>
clarifying :)
<br>
<p>a) The Format
<br>
<p>To keep things simple, it should probably look something like this:
<br>
<p>Name: [Name]
<br>
E-mail: [E-mail]
<br>
Activities: [A short paragraph stating what this person is up to and how it
<br>
is pertinent to attaining transhumanist goals.]
<br>
How to Help: [What does this person want or think is useful for other people
<br>
to accomplish in terms of helping this specific venture/activity?]
<br>
<p>b) My Contribution
<br>
<p>Name:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="mailto:reason@longevitymeme.org?Subject=Re:%20[GKES]%20figuring%20out%20just%20what%20everyone%20is%20here%20is%20doing%20to%20bring%20on%20a%20better%20world">reason@longevitymeme.org</a>
<br>
Activities:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I run the Longevity Meme (www.longevitymeme.org), a site and organization
<br>
that aims to a) successfully plant and grow the concepts of healthy life
<br>
extension in the public consciousness, b) be the seed for anti-aging
<br>
activism efforts analogous to 80s AIDs or cancer activism and advocacy, c)
<br>
network with other life extension advocacy groups to assist in their goals.
<br>
How to Help:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help us become larger and more effective. Link to the Longevity Meme. Join
<br>
the newsletter. Tell your friends about the site in the context of health
<br>
advice. Keep up with our action items and participate when you can. Make
<br>
suggestions.
<br>
<p>c) Names and Wild Guesses
<br>
<p>Ok, this is the fun part. I'll try not to offend :)

paragraph for this one :)

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Author, has probably propagated more useful memes that the rest of us
<br>
have had hot breakfasts.
<br>
<p>Aubrey de Grey [<a href="mailto:ag24@gen.cam.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20[GKES]%20figuring%20out%20just%20what%20everyone%20is%20here%20is%20doing%20to%20bring%20on%20a%20better%20world">ag24@gen.cam.ac.uk</a>]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Gerontologist (wow, I'm hoping I got that right) and one of the brains
<br>
behind the Methuselah Mouse Project that I think is a sparkling good idea.

<br>
<p>Anders Sandberg [<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20[GKES]%20figuring%20out%20just%20what%20everyone%20is%20here%20is%20doing%20to%20bring%20on%20a%20better%20world">asa@nada.kth.se</a>]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Well, I'm actually stumped when it comes to Anders single most
<br>
outstanding contribution. Too many to choose from, and too many I've no idea
<br>
about. Um. The creation and maintenance of <a href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans">http://www.aleph.se/Trans</a> maybe?
<br>
<p>I'm going to stop here because it's late, but already I'm missing out at
<br>
least a dozen people I could fill in if I went digging in the archives. If I
<br>
didn't mention you off the bat, it's because I have a terrible memory, my
<br>
offline archives are patchy at best and I didn't want to go delving.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Now, everyone who wants to be one the list with a nice entry like mine (but
<br>
with far better wording and grammar) should chime in and contribute to this
<br>
thread. Dan Fabulich will be gathering it all up and digging for
<br>
clarification. You should all feel free to nominate names and people I
<br>
haven't mentioned yet for inclusion if they don't speak up themselves...
