On 7/13/2003 Anders Sandberg responded to Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There was one thing missing imho.  That is how society and people will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; change. ... sociol/political/psychological/economic/ethical structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;True. This is in some sense &quot;deep green transhumanism&quot;. When I wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this I was not looking at people, but the Big Picture (TM) ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They think we envision a sterile high-tech future where we live like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posthuman gods in towers of diamond and steel and where all of creation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is centered on human desires. ... aiming ... to embrace complexity,
</em><br>
<p>On 7/13/2003 Hal Finney wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;We might suggest that the value of life is in evolution, in creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new kinds of life forms and new adaptations.  But even that, frankly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be done better by people than by natural processes. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The process of natural biological evolution is an eternal, ongoing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heartless war of predator against prey, with no quarter given or expected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Every step forward on the evolutionary ladder is accomplished through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;millions of deaths ... filled with terror and despair.
</em><br>
<p>The universe that follows from now on need not be filled with humans, but
<br>
it will look rather human to us, since many innovations pioneered by
<br>
humans will soon spread until most all life uses it or goes extinct.  One
<br>
of the most important is that of law; predator/prey relations will mostly
<br>
disappear and be replaced by farmer/farmed or other much more cooperative
<br>
relationships.  A related innovation is that specialization in production;
<br>
rather than have each organism produce most everything it needs for itself,
<br>
they will share an economy where they specialize.
<br>
<p>There is TV show on the future of evolution (I forget the name at the
<br>
moment), and they called me to ask me if I had something to
<br>
contribute to their show, and I told them that their speculations were
<br>
mostly off because they ignored these crucial issues.  Since they had
<br>
already invested a great deal in what they had done, they decided that
<br>
however persuasive were my arguments, they would do best to ignore them.
<br>
<p>Anders continued:
<br>
<em>&gt;complexity needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth. But it is not enough. I'm planning to write a more full analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the cancer cell/orchid issue, because it is really at the heart of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the problem. The burning of the cosmic commons in Robin's paper is great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth, but it does not seem to lead to much complexity, just more and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more efficiency at expanding. Here growth and evolution seems to reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complexity instead of enhance them. Under what circumstances do we see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an evolutionary radiation and the creation of new niches, and under what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circumstances do we get goo?
</em><br>
<p>Actually a richer cosmic commons model might well give a radiation.
<br>
What I did is more akin to modeling life in an ocean, where the main
<br>
variable of interest is how close each organism is to the surface.
<br>
In such a simple model, you'd get just a one-dimensional variation in
<br>
strategies.
