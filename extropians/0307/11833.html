Well, the angelic rating is a lifetime average, so if you coast long enough
<br>
then your angelic rating will go down. On the other hand, if you have built
<br>
up sufficient good deed capital then it is good that the system doesn't
<br>
punish too severely short-term coasting.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So one has the problem that one selects based on high ratings that are

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, you are right that it is difficult to think of a system that cannot be
<br>
&quot;milked&quot;. Some people succeed in milking the banking system but from this we
<br>
don't conclude that the banking system should be abandoned. The problem
<br>
would have to be that &quot;milking&quot; is so systemic that the angelic system
<br>
cannot be maintained. I imagine that the system would require its own
<br>
justice system, those accused of milking the system would have to face their
<br>
day of judgment in the angelic court.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Would it be ok
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for universities to set admission criteria in terms of an angelic
</em><br>
rating?
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm inclined to think that this shouldn't be a problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the first few years (when &quot;natural&quot; behaviors) were in effect yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as soon as people figured out how to milk the system the &quot;ratings&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be of questionable value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Again, I'm not sure that the milking would reach such a high percentage that
<br>
it would cause the collapse of the system. The system is based on measurable
<br>
deeds like hours volunteered and monies donated. It is true that there is a
<br>
possibility that the system could support some corruption: suppose you are
<br>
head of a charity and I offer a bride to you to lie on my behalf and say
<br>
that I volunteered 40 hours a week at your organization and donated millions
<br>
of dollars. This would do wonders for my angelic rating. I suspect that
<br>
others that know me would be aware that my angelic rating was immorally
<br>
obtained and would be tempted to report me to the angelic court. Indeed, I
<br>
think the temptation here to report would be a least as great There would be
<br>
some problem, for example, of determining whether a charity is legitimate or
<br>
not. (Please donate to the &quot;beer for Mark Walker fund&quot; might not be
<br>
legitimate). Fortunately, a lot of legal thinking has already gone into
<br>
defining this notion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is interesting -- such an approach might produce group (tribe)
</em><br>
supportive
<br>
<em>&gt; behaviors (above the average level) for a limited period of time -- that
</em><br>
might
<br>
<em>&gt; be of net benefit to society for some period -- but one has to wonder
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; whether there might be a net downside once the cat is out of the bag.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g. &quot;You mean you manipulated me into being a better person than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would otherwise naturally be -- how could you do that?&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; R.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No doubt some will feel that they are being manipulated, they could protest
<br>
by not doing any good or they might pretend not to do good while actually
<br>
doing good. The question is whether so many would rebel against the system
<br>
that it would collapse. I tend to think that the evidence that we have
<br>
suggests that this wouldn't be the case. My guess is most would think
<br>
(falsely) that they would perform the good deeds in the absence of the
<br>
system although acknowledging that the system might manipulate others. Those
<br>
who would already rank higher on the angelic system will likely approve of
<br>
the system because it recognizes their contribution and punishes the free
<br>
riders.
<br>
<p>A related worry is that some, with a Kantian bent, might wonder if the
<br>
system actually promotes moral behavior, not because more good consequences
<br>
don't obtain, but because they are not done for the right motive. That is,
<br>
if one is performing the &quot;good deeds&quot; just to move higher on the angelic
<br>
scale then the deeds are not being done for the right reason. Of course,
<br>
those of us that are more concerned with outcomes rather than the belief
<br>
that the only thing unconditionally good is the &quot;good will&quot; won't be
<br>
bothered by this objection.
