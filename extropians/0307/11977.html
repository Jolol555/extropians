<p>
Suppose that I suddenly found myself in the year 1936 about
<br>
fifty miles outside Berlin, and I had in my hand a remote
<br>
control switch that would detonate a Hiroshima-sized device
<br>
in the capital of Germany, and that I knew that this would
<br>
be my only chance to kill Hitler and his henchmen.
<br>
<p>I would scarcely hesitate, even though it would mean the
<br>
immediate deaths of 100,000 people.  I believe that my
<br>
knowledge of history makes it a good enough gamble, and
<br>
my conscience would allow no other choice.  Perhaps the
<br>
lives of as many as 30 million people would be saved by
<br>
my intervention.
<br>
<p>I think that quite a few readers of this list would concur.
<br>
<p>So now let's suppose that it's the year 2065, and a historian
<br>
in what's left of the decimated world civilization sadly
<br>
narrates:
<br>
<p>&quot;What I will never understand is how the United States---the
<br>
sole, yes *sole* superpower of the early years of this century
<br>
---allowed the world-wide proliferation of nuclear weapons to
<br>
proceed.  Weren't the consequences easily foreseeable?
<br>
<p>&quot;It was in 2003 or 2004 at the latest, that the last best
<br>
chance was missed.  After North Korea obtained its nuclear
<br>
weapons, Japan and Taiwan had no choice but to join the
<br>
club.  The regime change in Seoul in 2009 lit the fuse,
<br>
of course, and we all know what happened.
<br>
<p>&quot;Just think: imagine that somehow the U.S. had anticipated
<br>
that by 2050 there were going to be six (6) atomic wars, and
<br>
that hundreds of millions of people were going to perish,
<br>
and civilization very nearly along with it.  Would anyone
<br>
have been brave enough to have condoned an unprovoked attack
<br>
on North Korea, making it perfectly clear that proliferation
<br>
was *not* going to be an option?
<br>
<p>&quot;Probably at the time, no one could have felt confident 
<br>
enough of their logic, not even some of the most clear-
<br>
thinking Extropians in the world.  And had anyone been
<br>
able to foretell what is so obvious to us today, imagine
<br>
the defamation that they would have had to endure.
<br>
<p>&quot;Such an attack would have been almost completely without
<br>
historical precedent, and so necessarily would have struck
<br>
most people at the time as supremely evil.  But had they
<br>
only known!&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, as I have said, I personally would not recommend
<br>
that any nation execute an unprovoked nuclear attack on
<br>
any other at this time nor in the foreseeable future---
<br>
but I admit the possibility that I could be dead wrong.
<br>
<p>Lee
