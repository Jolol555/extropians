</em><br>
<p>Well, life itself is essentially pointless, but we keep doing that. There's
<br>
a great memeplex surrounding individualism, which is the basis for
<br>
transhumanism, amongst many other ideas. Certainly it is the basis for
<br>
desires for individual longevity and enhanced individual potency.
<br>
<p>Damien mentioned in another post an idea that I think is paramount at this
<br>
point; the top level replicators are now ideas (or memes if you go in for
<br>
them). Our human civilisation is the main character in it's own story, but
<br>
it is also the theatre for the competition of ideas. Ideas have the same
<br>
rules as genes; they need to survive and replicate. 
<br>
<p>This is how you can explain someone sacrificing himself for duty to country,
<br>
or deciding not to have children but instead to work and become wealthy. He
<br>
does not spread his genes, or continue himself; instead, he replicates the
<br>
ideas, or defends other holders of these ideas, and is rewarded for that by
<br>
the ideas.
<br>
<p>OK, that's basic meme theory. And what it says about Robert's idea above is
<br>
that it must also work for ideas; colonisation of the universe must not
<br>
reinforce any stable memeplex conceivable for the &quot;it's pointless&quot; argument
<br>
to hold.
<br>
<p>Possibly for individualism this is true. However, there are many imaginable
<br>
(existing!) forms of collective thinking memesets for which colonisation has
<br>
conceivable benefit, even if no material benefits are reaped in the lifetime
<br>
of the actors. 
<br>
<p>For instance, a strongly group-oriented collectivist nation might see the
<br>
act of colonising the galaxy as glorifying the state; the sacrifice of the
<br>
individual may be justified in such circumstances, even to the individuals
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>Or, a set of religious memes which deify &quot;creation&quot; might conceivably morph
<br>
into an urg to seed the stars with the work of the lord. 
<br>
<p>Or maybe some civilisation bumps into another civilisation, and is so
<br>
repulsed by it, or so confused by it, or brought so close to the brink of
<br>
extinction by it, that the decision is made to spread everywhere, with the
<br>
goal of eradicating all alien lifeforms and covering the universe with
<br>
understandable things.
<br>
<p>In short, there are a lot of reasons that critters act. Unless you have
<br>
*really* strong evidence, you must assume that anything will be tried by
<br>
someone, somewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Given the awesome multiplicative power of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even simple self-replication, once a civilisation can start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sending out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; large numbers it is very hard to get rid of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is easy to produce lots of &quot;simple&quot; self-replicators -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good idea to do so.  At least some of the bacteria in my gut would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to consume me if they could get around my immune 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system.  Better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to give then lots of opportunities to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is your opinion, but it's not the only possible one by any
<br>
means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Complex&quot;, and more importantly &quot;trustable&quot;, self-replicators may be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very difficult problem.  Do you *really* want to be standing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toe-to-toe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a copy of yourself when the resources of the universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start drying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up *knowing* that they know exactly what you know and you both know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;there can be only one&quot; (to steal a line from The Highlander)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>In the bullish times of universal expansion, I think it's fair to say that
<br>
many would likely ignore bearish predictions of the ultimate resource
<br>
crunch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;(//((! Have you seen the new gamma ray burster in the Milky Way?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes /||\, I have. I hope there were no intelligent life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around there.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;We will know when we send out or probes...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There seems to be a reasonable argument for the &quot;galactic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; club&quot; enforcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;Thou shalt not send out self-replicating probes&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interdiction -- because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any advanced civilization isn't going to want to deal with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they create in the future.
</em><br>
<p>We would do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But in general I think we are lacking something in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Fermi paradox. We need to think better here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it relates to the transition from a &quot;randomly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved&quot; intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. mutation and &quot;natural&quot; selection) into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self-directed&quot; evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question -- if you knew you were likely to survive until the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;end of the universe&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with high probability -- would you actively seek to create 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future problems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would eventually have to deal with?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think I would.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert
</em><br>
<p>Again, it depends a lot on your point of view.
<br>
<p>For instance, many extropians appear to believe that they very well *might*
<br>
survive until the end of the universe. How many of us have therefore moved
<br>
our focus to extreme long-range environmentalism/conservationism? Not many I
<br>
think; we tend to think that, rather than avoid digging holes, we should
<br>
build better ladders. Why wouldn't that thinking extend to advanced
<br>
civilisations?
<br>
<p>For instance, there's always been the question of what an MBrain actually
<br>
thinks about. Maybe a civilization/entity/intelligence which can reach such
<br>
a state gets concerned about finding a way out of the box (the observable
<br>
universe). If an MBrain can't work it out, or can get close but not the
<br>
whole way, then turning all of existence into computronium must begin to
<br>
looks like the positive alternative to a slow, hopeless, lingering death.
