A free state is a state in which you are free to leave :)
<br>
Just look at the &lt;&lt;people from Lancaster county&gt;&gt;; they
<br>
have an excellent system in place...

<p><em>&gt; One serious but unaddressed problem with building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;free state&quot; in today's world is that the existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states will not let you.
</em><br>
<p>You've pointed out some serious problems.  There are also - I'm not sure
<br>
what to call them - maybe ... impractical problems?
<br>
<p>When I first came to live in Seattle I lived not far from the original
<br>
&quot;Love Family,&quot; who *all* lived in one of the most architecturally ugly
<br>
buildings I've ever seen.  They were like a blast from the past - when
<br>
buffaloes roamed and the sky was not cloudy all day (I mean, they
<br>
dressed up like &quot;pioneers,&quot; you know?).  I used to observe their
<br>
children - the young ones seemed happy enough (in the special way that
<br>
young ones being naturally curious can be), but the adolescents looked
<br>
sad, restless, stunted, out of place ... they looked like they wanted
<br>
*out.*
<br>
<p>Why am I comparing (irony of ironies) a free state to a cult?  Because I
<br>
keep coming up with all sorts of impracticalities (and many of the them
<br>
are identical).
<br>
<p>Mama, what if your children don't want to grow up to be cowboys?  Papa,
<br>
how'r you gonna keep them down on the free state after they've seen
<br>
Pareeeeeee ...?  What if your sister falls in love with an outsider?
<br>
(Say, are you even going to let outsiders *in*?)
<br>
<p>Maybe I've just not hung out with gun aficionados enough to understand
<br>
the benefits of a free state, so pardon if my ignorance is showing.
<br>
But, in trying to sew the troublesome strands together to make it whole,
<br>
all I come up with is ... our dear little albeit imperfect democracy
<br>
that has made great strides in (irony or ironies) the democratic process
<br>
since its inception, and especially in the last few decades.  From the
<br>
perspective of the year 2003 the 1950s - holy Happy Days! - look like
<br>
the Dark Ages.
<br>
<p>I don't think a free state is ever going to work, boys ... not unless
<br>
something drastic happens, e.g.,  like if we blew ourselves back to the
<br>
Stone Age.  Too impractical, I say (not to mention a few other worrisome
<br>
thoughts crossing my alleged mind from time to time).
