<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Transhumanism and extropianism, to the average person, seem pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weird.  So long as that's the case, the media is going to cover them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as oddities.  So I don't think you can make major media
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism-friendly.  You'd be better off trying to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism / extropianism more media-friendly.
</em><br>
<p>I agree entirely. There's a lot of vocabulary and concepts that people need to understand in order to grok the benefits that transhuman and extropic thinking bring. In order to do that i think the benefits need to be trumpeted first. There needs to be some PR for intelligence. Then the interest in learning the facts will follow.
<br>
<p>To this end, i already have some media interests that are reaching a fairly wide audience and have a multi-media network that is launching nationally within the next two months. 
<br>
<p>All of these channels are based on building towards a transhuman friendly future. So, this list adn transhumanism in general has at least channel that is only 1 degree of separation from reaching a new, bigger and more &quot;mainstream&quot; audience.
<br>
<p>All that needs to happen in order to begin broadcasting transhuman ideas is for you to submit them. I can get them in print in a newspaper (soon to be newspapers) and online (soon to be in print) with a magazine. Additionally there will be other mediums available in the near future.
<br>
<p>The point is: We want to promote the ideas that are being discussed on this list. We want to promote the thinkers that are putting this information out. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How would you do that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) Get rid of jargony, science-fictiony words like &quot;transhuman&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;extropy&quot;, &quot;singularity&quot;, and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) Increase focus on short-term issues, research goals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3) Avoid making extreme, alarming, or incomprehensible pronouncements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;4) Recruit respected, high-profile scientists to the organizations (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least their periphery)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;5) Align yourself with mainstream movements and organizations like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reproductive rights movement, patient organizations lobbying for stem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cell research, and more mainstream think tanks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some will say that these sorts of steps would water down or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completely destroy the value of these institutions.  If there really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a technological singularity in the near future, or if molecular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufacturing is about to become a reality, or if unfriendly AIs are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear and present danger, then there may be no point to creating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more mainstream image.
</em><br>
<p>Again i agree. This is very much the direction we are heading. What we need is content.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other hand, a more mainstream image can be more effective in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the present, and the further away those eschatological technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are, the greater the value of mainstreaming.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps what's necessary here is a new entity - one that focuses on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more mainstream issues and concerns while keeping the longer term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implications in mind.  
</em><br>
<p>For anyone interested in contributing to the wider promotion of extropic ideas please feel free to email me offlist as well as on.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Devon
