<p>Yeah, if the Robert Weinberg model of stochastic inappropriate activation

or damage to oncogenes is right, cancer isn't inevitable (unless the
<br>
measure is somehow *defined* by one's exact cellular history to date).
<br>
Still more likely that you'll get cancer than be struck by a meteorite,
<br>
though.
<br>
<p>On the topic of the MWI, I put forward the following, from a crotchety
<br>
quantum mechanic on another list who inveighs against relative state
<br>
interpretations. Here's one nub of his case. I'd like to hear a reasoned
<br>
defence of MW from someone up to the task:
<br>
<p>=================
<br>
<p>Many Universes: originally/more correctly, Relative State Interpretation
<br>
that fundamentally cannot reproduce the probabilities (Everett introduced
<br>
the artifact that the branching is probabilistic!). Try out the branching
<br>
problem.
<br>
[This refers to a scientist in each state trying to do experiments to test
<br>
out the predicted probabilities of his QM manyworld. with a state 
<br>
vector that has 2 components with coefficients at psi1*psi1 = 0.9 and the
<br>
second at psi2*psi2 = 0.1. After three experiments, there would be 11 of the
<br>
16 branches in which the scientist(s) would be saying there is less than a
<br>
0.05 chance that this quantum mechanics is correct. With time, the percent
<br>
of universes in which the scientist(s) could still vouch for his(their) QM
<br>
would approach zero. The chance that we could live in a universe that
<br>
accepts QM is zero.]
