Eliezer S. Yudkowsky a écrit (29.7.2003/00:27) :
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Verbal thought is not the same as rational thought.  Rather, it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular kind of heavily abstract chain of deliberative statements, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often divorced from the intuitions that usually guide it.  Abstract verbal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning is only *more rational* if it *actually works better* - remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that at the heart of all this is Bayes' Theorem, which makes no mention of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the cognition is carried out.  If you are going to discuss genocide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'rationally' rather than 'instinctively' - and that should always be in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote marks - then you had better know the evolutionary psychology and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game theory and everything else that lies behind those instincts, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason why the instincts are there in the first place, why the ethical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instincts are if anything far too *weak* rather than the other way around. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   If you don't understand the evolutionary psychology of genocide, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game theory of cooperation, the ethics of deep uncertainty about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, the historical outcomes of similar proposals, then all you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing by reasoning 'rationally' (verbally) is taking the safety catch off 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a deadly gun.  I see no reason why someone who starts reasoning verbally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ignorantly, about genocide under the banner of 'rationality', should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be thought of any differently from someone who advocates genocide with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passionate hatred under the Romantic banner of 'honest feeling'.  Yes, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is possible to discuss genocide rationally, and whaddaya know, when you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss it rationally, in full knowledge of all the forces at play, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns out to be a more horrifying idea than mere emotional revulsion would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest.  I don't see rationality at work here.  I see an emotional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconnect combined with historical, psychological, evolutionary, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game-theoretical, and decision-theoretical ethical ignorance.  Yes, there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a verbal explanation, and it is a critical thing to learn.  But if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know it, you'd better not try and switch off your emotions until you do.
</em><br>
<p>What I don't understand is why you keep opposing various ways to get
<br>
at the truth, while valuations are just not about truth.
<br>
<p>If someone suggests that he will eat my leg because he's hungry,
<br>
arguments are not needed, from any theory, not even ethical theory. I
<br>
value my leg, and I will react strongly if it is threatened. Someone
<br>
may study *WHY* I value my leg, and to do such a study, he may invoke
<br>
various theories. But it won't make me more rational to do so *myself*
<br>
before to defend my leg, not any more than eating when hungry is only
<br>
rational if you understand how nutriments are assimilated.
<br>
<p>If for some reason you happen to value more than your own body, to
<br>
extend this valuation to many other people, then it is only normal for
<br>
you to react strongly when someone suggests they could be conveniently
<br>
killed in order to make room for some uncertain future.
<br>
<p>Jacques
