</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; current position, and as Voyager continues beyond it will shift back
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I can see that. Wouldn't the gravitational force also be weaker than expected 
<br>
if the voyager past the planet on its sun orbital trailing end ? A kind of 
<br>
gravital doppler shift.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Even worse, Jupiter is actually moving &quot;supersonically&quot; in this setting! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Voyager is approaching from straight ahead of the planet it will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience any gravitational field since Jupiter is moving faster than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the information about where it is is spreading through the gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field. So on one side of Jupiter you would actually be weightless! On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other side all the information is present and you get normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravity. And you get a discontinous bow shock where you go from no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravity to a mix of several accelerations pointing towards many former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions (likely just causing an inward accleration into the shock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cone).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I can't quite agree with this, although very nearly. I can see what you are 
<br>
saying and I am probably nit picking.
<br>
My take would be that the gravitational force would be normal on the leading 
<br>
side of the planet and you would 'appear to be' weightless on the other side. 
<br>
The fact really is that you would not be weightless, rather that the planet 
<br>
itself would be moving away from you faster than it is attracting you. so you 
<br>
would still be constantly falling towards the planet surface, but getting 
<br>
further away.
<br>
As for the sides of the planet !! I would imagine that gravity would be 
<br>
pulling you at an angle perpandicular to a point somewhere behind the center of the 
<br>
planet's mass. behind as in, behind its position along the planetary orbital 
<br>
path. so you would be standing at an angle. If the planet was moving fast 
<br>
enough and gravity propogated even slower, you may even be able to walk up 
<br>
buildings :o)
