<p>I wish :) I was let go and haven't even been able to get an interview

for a software position :)

<p><em>&gt;Dynamic and practical optimism has been more difficult in the last

<br>
<p>I don't necessarily agree; I'm optimistic insofar as I think that
<br>
eventually I'll
<br>
be able to extricate myself out of the current mess... and certes, it
<br>
doesn't
<br>
really effect my ability to read and contemplate current and &quot;future&quot; 
<br>
technologies/paradigms  in that the cost (at worst) is TV and other 
<br>
mindless activities....
<br>
<p>I do have to say though, as a person who is extremely dedicated 
<br>
to pursuing his own ideas out to their logical conclusion, resources,
<br>
*particularly* people resources, are next to impossible to come by
<br>
[barring government/univ funding (where they get copyright/patent),
<br>
or being fabulously independently wealthy].  Plus, to do anything
<br>
significant, certain skills [which require a serious amount of effort
<br>
and time to pickup] are currently beyond my ken.  Currently :)  But
<br>
I do remain optimistic, that given enough time on this planet [- sudden
<br>
death or illness], I'll hit my critical point in a couple of years :)
<br>
<p>More than anything else though, its the lack of a skilled [and
<br>
dedicated]
<br>
labor supply (read: architects rather than technicians).  Unfortunately,
<br>
I have yet to actually find a good (reliable) source for such [people]
<br>
material.
