<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Did you get as far as the end, where the appalling error resulting in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; tragedy was made clear?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What error was this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (That error, emblematic of certain discussions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; this topic, was firstly to overstate the supposed threat, and secondly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; allow a clever child to murder almost all the members of an entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; conscious species while playing what he regarded as a game). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your subtlety or opacity eludes me.
</em><br>
<p>It has been decades since I read this, so I infer that
<br>
that you are trying to say that the &quot;error&quot; was to
<br>
overstate the threat.  I do not recall that---as I
<br>
recalled it, the Earth was in a more-or-less struggle
<br>
for existence against a completely ruthless enemy.
<br>
In what places (and I am not trying to be subtle, Damien,
<br>
I just want to know), if you recall, was the other species
<br>
(in *that* book alone) represented as having any compassion
<br>
for humans?  Were there such parts?
<br>
<p>In all these exchanges, I have been careful to leave the 
<br>
most telling parts of your communications intact, definitely
<br>
not because I want to *win* in some misguided fashion this
<br>
discussion, but out of courtesy---and to hopefully not cause
<br>
you to repeat the most salient parts of your argument.
<br>
I'm getting to seldom expect the same courtesy.
<br>
<p>Originally, I happened to write
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sound as though *all* genocidal actions can be, or ought
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be dismissed, out of hand.  Have you read &quot;Ender's Game&quot;?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if that scenario isn't adequate to convince you, I am 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sure that you could think of one in sixty seconds or less
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that would.
<br>
<p>Well, it would be interesting for you to address the firmest
<br>
part of my argument.
<br>
<p>Moreover, I've felt more and more uncomfortable over the last
<br>
several decades as &quot;genocide&quot; is considered something far, far
<br>
more grave and evil than mere murder.  Since it's entirely 
<br>
possible that you are one of the people who is not especially
<br>
interested in there being lots and lots of future people, I'd
<br>
like to hear you explain why genocide is worse than murder.
<br>
<p>And if somewhere there is a race of totally genetically determined
<br>
entities open to no dialog at all, but among whose purposes is our
<br>
complete elimination, then why don't aren't you in favor of us
<br>
completely wiping them out if we can?    I guess it's good that
<br>
no sentient strains of smallpox have been discovered, because
<br>
they would not want for defenders and supporters on this list.
<br>
<p>Lee
