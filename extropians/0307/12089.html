<p><em>&gt;I think it is a feedback loop, thought defines language and in turn
</em><br>
language constrains thought, at least when you think with words. I don't
<br>
think the effect is very strong when you compare similar languages. I
<br>
spoke only one language (Italian) as a child, so most of the times I
<br>
think in that language. I know some other languages (English Spanish and
<br>
French, all indo-european languages) well enough to think in them when I
<br>
am speaking them, and I do not notice any significant difference. But I
<br>
am sure that if I could speak Chinese well enough to think in Chinese
<br>
when speaking Chinese, I would notice significant differences in my
<br>
thought patterns. At least this is what fluent speakers of two very
<br>
different languages (e.g. a child whose two mother languages are English
<br>
and Chinese) say.
<br>
<p>I think its through an availability mechanism;  I speak Arabic and
<br>
English fluently,
<br>
and certain thoughts or mechanisms are very difficult to &quot;translate&quot;
<br>
semantically
<br>
(ergo there exists no corresponding word or short phrase in the other
<br>
language).
<br>
In any event, I don't think that a language in and of itself necessarily
<br>
limits
<br>
thought development; however it can delay it....  Sufficiently
<br>
intelligent people
<br>
come up with new words all the time in their day-to-day dealings [that
<br>
map
<br>
to something significant missing from their current semantic
<br>
set].....And eventually
<br>
it filters down to the masses.  Put another way, knowing several
<br>
languages
<br>
expands ur ability to capture a thought precisely {and thus is highly
<br>
recommended};
<br>
knowing one language does not necessarily hinder that development of a
<br>
thought,
<br>
just delays it.  And that goes for radically different languages (like
<br>
English or 
<br>
Chinese), in that left to their own devices, the English and Chinese
<br>
would eventually
<br>
identify all the notions they want...  The order in which a particular
<br>
semantic notion
<br>
is discovered however, would probably be vastly different in such
<br>
extremes.
