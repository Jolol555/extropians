</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily - especially if the Romantics try to
<br>
phrase their arguments in terms the Classicals can
<br>
accept and debate, as seems to have happened in this
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>If I understand the logic correctly - and I'm not
<br>
arguing for or against it - the argument is that
<br>
merely
<br>
debating the &quot;extreme&quot; propositions indicates that we,
<br>
as a community, do not as strongly understand the
<br>
reasons against certain things treated as &quot;abhorrent&quot;,
<br>
and therefore our values (and actions spawned by said
<br>
values) appear to the outside world to have some
<br>
tendency towards those things.
<br>
<p>Among the counter-arguments: it is possible to desire
<br>
to learn why a thing is bad in order to strengthen
<br>
one's personal prejudices against it.  Also, assuming
<br>
that a given taboo does represent something that
<br>
really
<br>
is harmful, it is possible to quest for the &quot;true&quot;
<br>
evil, as in that which is actually harmful but is a
<br>
mere subset of the taboo (though this risks running
<br>
into, or even supporting, that part of the taboo which
<br>
is harmful - at least, until it is better understood;
<br>
this dissolves into a risk/reward scenario where the
<br>
risks and rewards are often ill-measured, and assumed
<br>
to be wildly different numbers by different parties).
<br>
<p>(Please don't use this as an excuse to relaunch into
<br>
the debate over these two points of view.  I merely
<br>
wish to explain and understand them, not debate which
<br>
is correct at this time.)
