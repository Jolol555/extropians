<p>This sounds to me like it presumes a form of psychological hedonism.  Who 
<br>
says that what *does in fact* make people happier, that is, which physical 
<br>
events will in fact put their brains into a state bearing happiness, is 
<br>
the metric of what they really want right now?  Right now I really don't 
<br>
want to be wireheaded.  Similarly, I suspect that many people (including 
<br>
me) would say that even if power/status would in fact make them happier, 
<br>
the right thing to do would still be to do good for the tribe.  In fact, 
<br>
you can openly acknowledge this as a fact about yourself and the things 
<br>
that make you happy, and still be a psychological altruist who chooses to 
<br>
act for the good of the tribe.
