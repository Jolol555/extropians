<p>Well, except that of course and self-evidently it is, since if your

a lot of trouble inventing science and learning not to chew your own

<br>
<p>=============
<br>
Umberto Eco has more than once quoted chapter 26, Book II, of Aulus
<br>
Gellius' Noctes Atticae, a second century encyclopaedia, which seems to
<br>
show that Gellius did not discriminate colours according to our (or the
<br>
spectrum's) ordering.  How did Gellius see the world, or at any rate
<br>
`elaborat[e] upon literary texts coming from different centuries' (p. 157)? 
<br>
<p>&quot;Diachronically speaking, Aulus Gellius was trying to put together the
<br>
codes of at least two centuries of Latin literature and, synchronically
<br>
speaking, the codes of different non-Latin cultures. Gellius must have been
<br>
considering diverse and possibly contrasting segmentations of the chromatic
<br>
field. ... Determined by his cultural information, Gellius cannot trust to
<br>
his personal perceptions, if any, and appears eager to see gold as red as
<br>
fire, and saffron as yellow as the greenish shade of a blue horse.&quot; (p. 171)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This power of verbal categories over our illusory sense of direct,
<br>
unimpeachable perception of the world is known in linguistics as the
<br>
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis; it fell from favour in the 1970s, but is making a
<br>
qualified comeback. 
<br>
<p>...A Scientific American review by Philip E. Ross (February, 1992) finds
<br>
that its subsequent debunking might not have been exhaustive. True, `Whorf
<br>
had asserted that Eskimos use many distinct words in place of the one
<br>
English word &quot;snow&quot;.... But Laura E. Martin, an anthropologist at Cleveland
<br>
State University, traced the story to its sources and found that Whorf had
<br>
exaggerated the number of Eskimo snow roots while understating the number
<br>
in English: slush, powder, blizzard and so forth.' Nevertheless, some
<br>
Australian languages suggest that `spatial conceptualization is not
<br>
universal', although such distinctions `are mastered very early in life'
<br>
(pp. 11-2).
<br>
<p>...What then of Aulus Gellius and his saffron yellow as the greenish shade
<br>
of a blue horse? Has the eye been primed by nature, or are hues secondary?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Guinea Dani have only two colour words: `mola', for warm, vivid
<br>
hues, and `mili' for cold, gloomy tones.  Nearly 20 years ago Eleanor Rosch
<br>
tested Dani response to carefully selected coloured chips, and undid her
<br>
Whorfian beliefs in a single stroke. Individual Dani had difficulty coming
<br>
to agreement on which intermediate hues were mola or mili, but (in a
<br>
subsequent test) had virtually none in identifying which of 40 chips each
<br>
had been shown. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The Dani turned out to recognize colors in a manner very similar to the
<br>
Americans - making the same confusions, for example - though their overall
<br>
scores were not as high. Thus, differences in naming structure were not
<br>
paralleled by differences in the way in which colors were stored in memory
<br>
or accessed by recall.... The ways in which individuals from different
<br>
cultures remember colors seemed to reflect the organization of the nervous
<br>
system, not the structure of particular lexicons.&quot; (p. 344-5)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More notable still was cross-cultural work done about the same time by
<br>
Berlin and Kay, who `studied the color-naming practices of individuals
<br>
drawn from twenty genetically diverse languages, ranging from Arabic to Ibo
<br>
(Nigeria) to Thai' (p. 348). The number of basic colours per culture ranged
<br>
from two (the Dani, say) to eleven (English). What shook many cultural
<br>
relativists, though, was the discovery of certain invariant factors:
<br>
<p>&quot;[W]hen confronted with chips spanning the full spectrum of hues, their
<br>
informants selected the same focal areas for colors, irrespective of
<br>
whether they had names for them; that is, [they] agreed about what was a
<br>
`good blue' or a `poor green', even if their culture lacked names for these
<br>
colors.&quot; (p. 348)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the least predictable finding was a regular ordering, across 98
<br>
different cultures, such that if only two terms exist these translate or
<br>
code to bright/dark, white/black; if there is a third, it is always red.
<br>
Fourth and fifth are yellow or green, in either order; then blue and brown
<br>
compete for sixth and seventh place; purple, pink, orange and grey complete
<br>
the spectrum (p. 349). In this case at least, there is very little scope
<br>
for philology to interfere with ontology, except to mutilate it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleanor Rosch has summarized the intellectual reverse which these
<br>
discoveries forced upon her and her colleagues, which to my mind resembles
<br>
the blow that empirical research, such as that collated by Farrell, strikes
<br>
at the heart of Freud's doctrines. To their considerable surprise (for they
<br>
had started with a sense that the Whorfian hypothesis was virtually
<br>
self-evidently true), they
<br>
<p>&quot;discovered that colors appeared to be a domain suited to demonstrate just
<br>
the opposite of linguistic relativity, namely, the effect of the human
<br>
perceptual system in determining linguistic categories. Very similar
<br>
evidence exists in the domains of geometric form and emotion categories.
<br>
Furthermore, psychological principles of categorization may apply to the
<br>
formation of all categories, even in culturally relative domains.
<br>
<p>&quot;At present, the Whorfian hypothesis not only does not appear to be
<br>
empirically true in any major respect, but it no longer even seems
<br>
profoundly and ineffably true.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, Rosch asks, `has it been so difficult to demonstrate effects of
<br>
language on thought?' (Ibid). Because, she concludes, it could only be true
<br>
if major lexical distinctions and the categories of `nature' which they fix
<br>
within language(s) were `almost accidentally formed' (Ibid) - in effect,
<br>
the Saussurean postulate. By contrast, her research suggests forcefully
<br>
that, for the categories she has investigated, the links are strongly
<br>
motivated; language categories are shaped by neuro-empirical givens.
