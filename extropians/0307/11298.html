Head flushing was rare in schools here, typically because the individuals 
<br>
most people would have wanted to head flush were the fatty lard asses that 
<br>
no one could push over, never mind invert.  Plus the fact that oftentimes 
<br>
the flush mechanism was broken and hence the bowl was, shall we say, 
<br>
already holding it's capacity.
<br>
<p>As for dunking in general, we worked on a larger scale.  Right beside the 
<br>
Secondary school I attended was an old mill pond (for a long gone gunpowder 
<br>
factory, IIRC), complete with its own family of swans and some 
<br>
ducks.  Dunking usually consisted of a mob of 10-20 or so chasing the 1st 
<br>
year students around until exhaustion set in, grabbing the nearest one, and 
<br>
flinging him bodily into the stream.  On occasion (for the big bonus 
<br>
points) they'd manage to get the swans riled up and watch the hapless child 
<br>
get pecked and chased.
<br>
<p>Then the apple fights of course.  Good fun when a teacher took one full 
<br>
force in the side of the head.
<br>
<p>And not forgetting Murderball.
<br>
<p>Ah yes, takes me back....
