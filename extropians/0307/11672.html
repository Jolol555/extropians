<p>
<em>&gt; To be perfectly frank, the reason I've had a hard time committing myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to act on transhumanism in any meaningful way is that I've had an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely hard time figuring out how and why to do that.
</em><br>
<p>Same here.  I've been struggling with that as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many people here have already pointed out the problems of deterministic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimism; many Marxists (deterministic optimists of a very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breed) used to call this the philosophy of the &quot;obstetrician&quot;: if all goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as normal, the revolution is inevitable; so all we can do is get ready for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  Get people used to the idea.  Hold hands.  If, by some chance, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergency arises that looks like it's going to threaten the outcome, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all means, fix it, if you can.  But other than that, all that's left now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is cheerleading...  don't knock yourself out over it.
</em><br>
<p>Bertrand Russell once pointed out that Marxism is remarkably similiar to
<br>
Christianity, at least in it's eschatology.  Damien pointed out in &quot;The
<br>
Spike&quot; that &quot;Singulatarianism&quot; can go in that direction as well if we're not
<br>
careful.
<br>
<p>Ray Kurzweil was recently interviewed by the new age magazine &quot;What is
<br>
Enlightenment?&quot;, a magazine that, between the hilarious adds for cosmic
<br>
foo-foo, actually contains some interesting and thought-provoking articles.
<br>
In this latest issue, there was a long article about eschatology through the
<br>
ages, which lead me wonder if each level of psychological development (in a
<br>
system such as the Clare Graves model, or Spiral Dynamics, which many list
<br>
members are familiar with) doesn't have it's own version of the eschaton:
<br>
<p>Red- A destructive apocalypse that destroys everyone, only the strongest
<br>
survive- Ragnarok.
<br>
<p>Blue- A destructive apocalypse that destroys the infidels but elevates god's
<br>
chosen people to immortality- the Christian Apocalypse.  Alternately,
<br>
society could degrade to a point at which it becomes impossible for
<br>
individuals to liberate themselves, and a savior must redeem the world-
<br>
Buddhism's notion of the Maitreya.
<br>
<p>Orange- Through the use of rational science and technology, life can be
<br>
improved exponentially.  However, we eventually hit a curve leading towards
<br>
infinite progress- the singularity.  Alternately, there's the negative
<br>
version of this- the Marxist view, in which the consolidation of capital in
<br>
the hands of the few and massive unemployment eventually leads to a
<br>
proletarian revolution.
<br>
<p>Green- ??? (The marxist theory could apply here as well- but green has a
<br>
more &quot;spiritual&quot; side to it as well)
<br>
<p>Yellow- ??? (Ken Wilber mused about a sort of Yellow Eschaton in last year's
<br>
&quot;Boomeritis&quot;- speaking of which, I never wrote a review of it for the
<br>
list...)
<br>
<p>Of course, is this sort of thinking healthy, or is it the manifestation of
<br>
some sort of pathology?  As I've pointed out to people before, just because
<br>
a behavior is exhibited almost universally throughout history doesn't make
<br>
it correct- slavery, belief in a personal god, or astrological divination
<br>
come to mind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Eliezer has at least claimed to adopt a position something like this...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I note that he still seems to find time to read a few web comics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every now and again, and perhaps watch a bit of anime.  Still, we have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that Eliezer and others like him are at least trying to be ascetic;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe they already are at least &quot;maximalist&quot; ascetics if one considers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's own present willpower as a limitation which we work to overcome.
</em><br>
<p>It appears that he also takes time to post to the extropy list and write
<br>
short stories.  Judging by &quot;Non-Player Character&quot;, I'd say he's logged more
<br>
than a few hours playing CRPG's, which are among the biggest time-burners
<br>
I've ever encountered.  And it wouldn't suprise me if he likes to crack open
<br>
a novel or two from time to time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, of course, aside from that, we'd have to worry about an extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-extropian alternative: fatalism, here employed in all the negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senses.  We're going to die at the normal time [or sooner], no matter what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do, so why bother working to overcome it?  Why shouldn't extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just &quot;get over our fear of death&quot; and come to terms with life as it is, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some people wish we would?
</em><br>
<p>Extropians are generally very &quot;orange-meme&quot;, to use the term from Spiral
<br>
Dynamics, and therefore very egocentric- not in the violent, carelessly
<br>
selfish &quot;red&quot; way, but in the way of the ethical individualist.  Facing
<br>
death is generally out of the question to egocentrists, in a similiar manner
<br>
to the green tendency to not want to face their inherent narcissism, or the
<br>
blue tendency to not want to face the fact that their religious beliefs are
<br>
based, at heart, on a pious lie.  Of course, might facing death and getting
<br>
over one's fear of it make one more productive, happier, and more sensible?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I've just listed three extremist philosophies: fatalism, asceticism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obstetrecianism.  Each one advocates a radically different attitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards how we should live our life: fatalism suggests that we all need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see therapists immediately, develop a family, and live for today while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building a legacy as we plan for retirement.  Obstetricianism suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we plan our lives as if we are already immortal today: invest in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely long term by taking few risks, acquring lots of money and saving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and advocating the future.  Asceticism tells us to abandon our earthly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursuits and to work.  Hard.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe we need to recognize all three approaches- realizing the future will
<br>
require hard work (Asceticism), long-term planning and advocacy
<br>
(Obstetricianism), and a sane, realistic approach to the near-term
<br>
(Fatalism).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As everyone keeps saying, obstetricianism may have seemed more plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the 90s, but in the last few years it's grown to look pretty dingy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, more to the point, it's unproductive.  Yet, when Bryan says this:
</em><br>
<p>It was always unproductive, but I also think most of the doom and gloom
<br>
we're seeing today is a bit misguided and premature.  If one looks at
<br>
economic growth curves, they ultimately follow an upward trend, but not
<br>
without going through spectacular leaps and falls that deviate strongly from
<br>
the median trend.  Look at the American 20th century- it's ultimately a tale
<br>
of depression and wars punctuated by booms and major social and
<br>
technological changes, yet all ultimately on an upward trend of growth.
<br>
Even with the economic lull we're in right now, the foundation is being laid
<br>
for the next &quot;revolution&quot;- not nanotech or biotech, but ubiquitous wireless
<br>
computing and virtual reality- the &quot;second information revolution&quot;, if you
<br>
will.  Whenever I see someone carrying a loaded, gimmicky cell phone, I
<br>
remind myself what a PC in 1980 was capable of.  When I see the latest 3d
<br>
online games, I'm stunned by how far graphical realism has come in the past
<br>
few years.  We're within a decade of Stephenson's &quot;Metaverse&quot;- a digital
<br>
world of mobile wearable interfaces that allow anyone to &quot;plug in&quot;, anytime,
<br>
anywhere.  Of course, this could be a mixed blessing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's funny is, a lot of fears could be alleviated if we just admitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how difficult this stuff is.  Designer babies?  Not likely!
</em><br>
<p>In the age of glowing rabbits and super mice?  Designer babies aren't as far
<br>
away as you might want to think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as a sort of &quot;antidote&quot; to obstetricianism, I know I can't help but think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to myself that if he's right, and the ultratechnologies are as &quot;unlikely&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as he suggests (or even conceptually confused) and that most of it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;hype&quot;, asceticism is no way to spend one's life.
</em><br>
<p>There are a lot of ways to spend one's life, and what's right for one person
<br>
isn't right for another.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To use Eliezer as an example again, (never merely as a means, I promise,):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last I checked, Eliezer has no girlfriend and no intention/expectation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even seeking one, no job except for pursuing the Singularity, no pleasures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except for those he takes with some measure of guilt/remorse.  (That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling you get in the back of your throat... I might be having it now as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I write this.)
</em><br>
<p>Among my friends, I count about eight CS/CE students between the age of 19
<br>
and 25 (Eliezer's age group), and what I know of Elie's lifestyle doesn't
<br>
strike me as very different from these guys.  None of them are currently
<br>
dating, only two of them have ever had girlfriends, and they generally don't
<br>
spend much time pursuing them.  They spend most of their time either
<br>
working, hacking code, arguing on message boards, or playing computer games.
<br>
Only one of them seems to have any interesting asperations (and his is to
<br>
get in on the next tech boom and use the money he makes in that field to
<br>
attempt a privatized colonization of Mars).
<br>
<p>Now, Elie may/may not have a bigger guilt complex than these guys regarding
<br>
how he uses his time.  (I'm inclined to think that, judging by Elie's sense
<br>
of humor, he plays up the guilty conscience for our entertainment)  I
<br>
somehow doubt that his asceticism is as extreme as you make it sound, nor
<br>
does it seem strange to members of the Wired generation who spend a lot of
<br>
time around CS students and hackers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is all fine if that works... nobody said asceticism would be easy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but if the Singularity is &quot;hype&quot;, then an ascetic lifestyle devoted to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be beyond absurd: it would be a tragedy.  Perhaps it would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noble tragedy, if the work of the ascetic laid the groundwork for grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements in the lives of our descendents, after everyone alive today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is dead.  But if the ultratechnologies are *just* &quot;hype&quot;, then it wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be that.
</em><br>
<p>Last summer I submitted a post on an Extropian look at Pascal's Wager.
<br>
Really, in my mind, no lifestyle is tragic or absurd as long as it is the
<br>
one you choose and you're not (purposefully) harming others.  And, as I put
<br>
in the post, if the work is done in vain, what has truly been lost, if there
<br>
is no purpose to life?  Not much of anything.  It may seem that it takes a
<br>
rather heroic individual to make that gamble, but when one looks at it from
<br>
the perspective of a nihilist, it doesn't seem a gamble at all, just a
<br>
choice.  And when one looks at the hardships endured by humans throughout
<br>
history, Elie's &quot;sacrifices&quot; look pretty minor, and only tragic in a comedic
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p>Not that I don't admire Eliezer, I certainly do, and I like to think that
<br>
the future is more in his hands than in the hands of George W. Bush or Hu
<br>
Jintao.  But time will tell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, I've figured out how to be an obstetrician, because it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidly easy.  Anyone can do it.  But I can't be an ascetic so long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's a better than even chance (from this side of the fence) that I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really an obstetrician or that we're all doomed.
</em><br>
<p>Anyone can say &quot;I believe in God&quot;, but few can shave their heads and take
<br>
the vow of silence.  The question is, which one gets you to heaven?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the meantime, I work a fulltime job doing stuff unrelated to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity (but I'm still young) ... and wait ... and cheerlead.
</em><br>
<p>I'm still in the position of being unsure what to do with myself.  I still
<br>
have two more years to go on my BA- I'll graduate in Spring of 2005 with a
<br>
degree in Philosophy and Political Science.  Whether or not there's anything
<br>
really extropic out there for me to do is questionable (or any job out there
<br>
for me, period).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hinted at the answer above, but it should seem obvious now what it must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be: all of the positions I've described are &quot;extreme.&quot;  None of them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balanced against the other; all of them are taken to their &quot;logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions.&quot;  It's clear that there needs to be a middle ground, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sliding scale.  Get used to working part time and perhaps I'll find it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more fulfilling than I realize; maybe I'll get hooked and become an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ascetic instead.
</em><br>
<p>I think the balanced approach is the way to go.  Too many people scorn the
<br>
middle path, whether it be in politics, spirituality, or life in general,
<br>
even though it seems, after much observation, to be the sanest approach of
<br>
all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps my imagination is simply drained, but it's hard to see what kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of work I can usefully do in my free time, to contribute to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultratechnologies.  Bryan was completely right when he said that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cast a vast, ominous shadow over any attempt at practical action.&quot;  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, I respect the Free State Project, but it's a rather long shot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it'd bring the Singularity much closer.  It's a lot easier for me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine ascetic life paths than it is for me to think of a way to usefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute in my spare time.
</em><br>
<p>If the Free State Project will even succeed at all is questionable at this
<br>
point.  I'm less than optimistic about the project, although I am,
<br>
admittedly, intrigued by it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have sent a few extra dollars to ExI, and the Singularity Institute...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just sent a few more as I think about it.  But it's not the same.
</em><br>
<p>More than I've done.  Money's a bit tight for me right now though, being
<br>
unemployed for the past month.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hopefully, I'm just not clever enough to see the other options.  Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestions?
</em><br>
<p>I could use some too.
