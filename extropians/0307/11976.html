</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on this but I believe you're missing an important social dynamic.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and some stranger yells

<em>&gt; &gt; at me, it will be counterproductive on their part.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that it is objectively determinable what is truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid and despicable?  You make it sound very much as if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do.
</em><br>
<p>Do I believe there are standards that should not be violated?  Yes, I do.  
<br>
Therefore when I see those standards violated or proposing doing so for what 
<br>
appear to be highly suspect reasons I consder that action or proposed action 
<br>
as despicable.   Yes.   Whether you consider it fully objective in some 
<br>
hyper-rational fairyland or not is beside the point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you attempt to rephrase that, I predict that you will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notable difficulty in trying to mean the same thing.  There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a reason for that.  What you are trying to mean here, is, IMO,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather nonsensical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Clearly you do have standards yourself.  Clearly you do consider the violation 
<br>
of those standards wrong.  So are you picking at a nit here?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; My defenses will go up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a friend of mine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone who I respect, mildly tells me that I should reconsider, I may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or may not pay it much heed, or realize just how egregious a statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the real dynamic is that he perhaps indeed should yell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at you---because evidently some of his friends are of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intolerant dispositions, that his security, safety, privileges,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or fortune may be impaired if he doesn't learn to keep his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mouth shut about some things.  This is, of course, the true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconscious message communicated to those we shout down (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to shout down):  Beware---be afraid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the message to think twice or more before proposing killing 10^8 
<br>
human beings as a utilitarian value is a particularly bad message to send as 
<br>
a group.  Do you?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a friend of mine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone who I respect, reacts with obvious dismay and tells me quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strongly that what I've just said is dangerous, then I will take note.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Exactly.  Some ideas---alas even here---are just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous to speak aloud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Dangerous?  Where is the danger of simply being told that one is on an 
<br>
appalling right bender and should get a grip?   That is all the responses 
<br>
amounted to after all.   I don't see any terrible danger or intellectual 
<br>
brutality going on there.  Do you?  Seriously?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If the Emperor has no clothes (and looks to be missing some other major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assets), we should not be afraid to say it.   In fact, it's our duty ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We DEFINITELY should not be afraid to say ANYTHING.  Especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list.  Good grief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Then we should not be afraid to say that X is an utterly appalling and 
<br>
repugnant idea and that we are SHOCKED that Y would say such a thing.  Aren't 
<br>
you beating people up for their honest reactions?  Why is the floating of the 
<br>
notion that 10^8 murders might be of benfit something to be protected and 
<br>
respected in your mind while the horror and repugnance of people on this list 
<br>
is not?   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But as for &quot;duty&quot;, I don't quite agree.  Some may feel like not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking part in certain debates---and that's okay---so it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a duty.  But yes, evil triumphs when good men do nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And so you may wish to construe it that way, in which case I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree.
</em><br>
<p>Evil triumphs when good people say nothing out of some rather twisted notion 
<br>
of all things being tolerable.
