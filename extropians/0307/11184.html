I guess after years you get so used to spam you begin to put up with it.
<br>
Currently I get at least one variation on the Nigerian scam, a half dozen penis
<br>
enlargement, viagra-M or F varieties, some HGH resellers, and a few bargain
<br>
hunter  ones per day.  That's with a netscape  and  phone company ISP address.
<br>
My hotmail is a different story.
<br>
I have just about given up using it for all the spam.
<br>
I still look at the spam mail once in a while  to keep up with the ways spammers
<br>
<p>address their mail and break up databases to send out mail.
<br>
For Example since the Nigerian Scam I would never use headers similar to theirs
<br>
because my recipient may accidentally  delete or block mail with that header.
<br>
<p>I have had one occurance of my identity being hijacked to date.
<br>
More embarrasing than anything else.  I had signed on with a number of
<br>
yahoogroup lists.  Bear in mind that I had listed  all my list recipients on one
<br>
send header.
<br>
The lists were all pro marijuana sites.  The medical food bar we make has a
<br>
medical version with marijuana.  The next day an email with my name and address
<br>
but not my company name posted to one site something about the reasons for
<br>
outlawing marijuana.
<br>
There was a &quot;what the hell&quot; response and I posted &quot;never mind.&quot;
<br>
<p>Maybe I shouldn't take it so lightly, but I still don't transfer cash online so
<br>
nobody can rob me blind.
<br>
<p>Also, nobody is going to sell me anything I don't really need.
