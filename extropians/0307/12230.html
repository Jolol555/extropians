<p>[charles] That's a good point... but it cuts both ways.  In the
<br>
historical 
<br>
examples one never knows the complete context, 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; it can, ergo why people discuss history.  At least that occurred
<br>
in our universe; thus its far more likely to be relevant.  Thats the
<br>
nice
<br>
thing about history; there's so many different viewpoints to examine and
<br>
choose from, and hindsight is always 20/20.
<br>
<p>[charles] whereas in the book one 
<br>
knows, or can know, the complete context.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; Thats facetious at best; you're reading a fiction book.  Unless you
<br>
are
<br>
the author, you have absolutely no idea what the complete context
<br>
of the book is; just what the author has currently decided to expose
<br>
to the reader.  Furthermore, there is nothing to indicate that a valid
<br>
comparison can be necessarily drawn from the book mapping to our
<br>
current reality.  If they were doing a book review, than yes,
<br>
I'ld agree &lt;within the bounds of the book&gt;; they are however,
<br>
discussing real-life effects of the genocide of human beings.
<br>
Pointing out the fictional character had second thoughts while
<br>
nice, is really not that useful.  Arguing the reason (or rationale)
<br>
the author used to generate that particular fictional response
<br>
might be.  Using that rationale as conclusive proof however, is
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>[charles] However, I think the &quot;Ender's Game&quot; referred to above was
<br>
actually a 
<br>
short story, or perhaps a novella.  It appeared in either Astounding or 
<br>
Analog.  The books followed decades later.  But the error was shown in 
<br>
the original story.  (I must admit I never read the expansions into
<br>
books.)
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;i've read the book (and the sequels); I didn't know there was a
<br>
short story
<br>
(original?) out there that was different from the book...  In any event,
<br>
my
<br>
point is broader than this particular subconversation... too often I see
<br>
people
<br>
resorting to movies and books as a method for providing proof..  I would
<br>
rather
<br>
see our history (humanity as a whole) embraced and mined than have
<br>
others
<br>
consistently resort to fictional works.  Shakespeare may have been
<br>
brilliant,
<br>
but he's not the *only* source for human psychology... and more relevant
<br>
than
<br>
repeating someone else's observations or themes is the ability to
<br>
generate
<br>
ur own analysis from available (stuff that u directly observed) events.
<br>
The process by which such insights are arrived at is *far* more
<br>
valuable,
<br>
and incidentally, more complete (insofar as u understand the nuances
<br>
necessary in your own particular viewpoint or version of history).
<br>
<p>You could of course, just tack an IMHO on that last paragraph..
<br>
<p>One final thought; what the media and movies (and yes, even
<br>
fictional works in their heyday) represent does not indicate the
<br>
norm in reality.  Its a shame people have such difficulty in 
<br>
observing the difference.
