<p>So little? :-) One of the drawbacks of having an old website with my

email address on nearly every page is that I'm in all spam databases.
<br>
<p>I will likely move digitally shortly, so don't get surprised by a new 
<br>
.net.persona (but I still don't know how to transfer the parts of my 
<br>
mind that live in akira.nada.kth.se - that is even harder than moving 
<br>
email).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Spam itself is also a detriment to forming new relationships with

</em><br>
<p>This is IMHO the main problem of spam. I can delete spam quickly, but I 
<br>
know some real mail does get lost, and it hurts. Of course, even the 
<br>
email I get much gets lost in the huge pile of &quot;important, better 
<br>
consider a good answer&quot;-email. 
<br>
<p>Spam is an attention drain, and that is its real crime. Attention is the 
<br>
sole scarce resource these days for most us - with the aids of modern 
<br>
society and technology almost any desire can be fulfilled, but we only 
<br>
get 24 hours (minus sleep) of attention at best. Spam tries to grab 
<br>
attention to get us into the desire, interest and action phases but 
<br>
since the stuff advertised is of such dubious value it mainly wastes 
<br>
attention of a huge group of people per &quot;successful&quot; customer.
<br>
<p>The pay for email is IMHO an elegant solution (since it is not based on
<br>
fallible email filters, ineffectual and coercive spam laws or internet
<br>
disrupting black holing but by a voluntary change of the economics of
<br>
the situation), but I doubt it can easily be implemented unless we get
<br>
good micropayment aggregation systems (I read some papers about them,
<br>
and the cryptographics is wonderful and ingenious, but the economy and
<br>
sociology is far harder to solve). 
<br>
<p>Maybe one could do a crude version by having the person on the other end
<br>
do a confirmation; you email me, my exoself emails you a &quot;Are you sure
<br>
you want to reach Anders?&quot; (here there is need for some anti-bot
<br>
coding), and a reply causes the email to be forwarded to my main
<br>
mailbox. That seems to be far too cumbersome to work, although the
<br>
software is easy. Maybe an improvement is to use some IM that gives the
<br>
mailing person the question - that would likely save time and not 
<br>
clutter the mailbox. But IMs are highly local and incompatible. And the 
<br>
solution does get nicer with money involved.
