<p><em>&gt;There are no doubt a lot of people on this list who know a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things, and suggesting they are wrong in the face of overwhelming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence is absurd. I would never, for example, suggest Amara's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descriptions on the formation of dust clouds is incorrect, however her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical account and perception of US involvement in the Afghan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Invasion certainly was, and I presented a clear, calm, precise argument
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
<em>&gt;suggesting as much.
</em><br>
<p>Matus:  I wish you would have found somebody else with whom to make
<br>
your point.  I am not subscribed here and I only read a small
<br>
percentage of the messages. Even when I was able to pay more
<br>
attention to this list in the past, I'm relatively sure that it was
<br>
obvious that I have a fundamental disconnect to your worldview, and
<br>
I know that I was unable to communicate my own worldview to you (and
<br>
the other aggressive and prolific posters). Usually now I lack  the
<br>
resources and motivation necessary to try to write here. I write
<br>
this message now much more for the newer people on the list than for
<br>
you,  since I don't often enter onto the extropians list any more.
<br>
<p>My reason for writing this message is to say that I wish you
<br>
wouldn't be so confidently sure of your facts regarding the topic of
<br>
Afghanistan and other political topics. On that particular message
<br>
of Afghanistan, to which I think you are referring (I didn't read
<br>
through to the end, it was very long), my memory of that message was
<br>
that you presented information from a number of documents which you
<br>
found on the Web, and I presented words from a documentary book, and
<br>
from Afghans with whom I have spoken and/or were friends. I know
<br>
that I lacked patience at the time to write more, and because of
<br>
my usual ongoing limitations (lack of time to write, frequent travel,
<br>
lack of access to Internet,  RSI typing hands), I probably did not
<br>
do a very good job to present my view.
<br>
<p>If one considers that our information sources were vastly different,
<br>
I don't think one can ever say absolutely you were right, and I was
<br>
wrong or vice versa. Perhaps my friends or the documentaries I read
<br>
were wrong about the sequence of events, but then that would mean
<br>
that a chain of related events and other people were wrong too.
<br>
Well, that's possible. Or perhaps the duration of time covered in
<br>
the documentary I read (to 1986) or the places where the writer
<br>
interviewed people were different than what was covered for your
<br>
data. Or perhaps what was written in official government documents
<br>
were never manifested in the real lives of the people living there.
<br>
Well, that's possible, too. In the end, on that topic, I trusted my
<br>
people sources because, to me, direct sources of that kind (words
<br>
from people through which I've already filtered by different means)
<br>
seemed to be the most reliable. I did not write further on this
<br>
topic at the time to present my side (for obvious reasons), so hence
<br>
the reason for writing this particular  message.
<br>
<p>I urge you to choose your information sources wisely, and gather
<br>
your information from a variety of sources. 'Facts' regarding
<br>
political and cultural issues can be fuzzier than you think.
<br>
<p><p>-------
<br>
<p>On gathering data on political and cultural topics -
<br>
<p>My own hierarchical scheme for the best ways to gather information on
<br>
political and cultural topics is the following, with the heaviest
<br>
weighting, starting at number 1), and usually combining a number
<br>
of sources  to reach my own synthesis and/or perspective.
<br>
<p>1) Live in the location of the news.
<br>
(Note: this is very different from the experience of being a visitor)
<br>
<p>2) Visit the location of the news.
<br>
<p>3) Talk to the people, who are from that region.
<br>
<p>4) Read media in the language of that region.
<br>
<p>5) Read media from that region translated into English.
<br>
<p>6) Read several world media (English).
<br>
<p>The Economist is my favorite source of high-quality, world news,
<br>
printed in English. One reason I like them is that they have some
<br>
reporters (I don't know how many) who are native, living in the
<br>
regions from where they gather their news.
<br>
<p>The other newspapers and magazines in English drop steeply for me,
<br>
in terms of reliability, so I tend to read several in English from
<br>
different countries, if I want more information, in order to get
<br>
different perspectives.
<br>

... miscellany ...
Since 1996, I have not owned a T.V.
I try to practice healthy skepticism, especially with
regards to what emerges from the mouths of politicians.
I try not to weigh anything that I read on the Internet (it's
called the Web of Lies for a good reason), until I have found
other sources of information which can  support the writing and/or
the writer. Of course, I get  lazy sometimes. And yes, sometimes the
Web provides the only information  source on a particular topic.
