<em>&gt; Ja, this list is indeed flamey, always has been.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would suggest that it is possible to have totally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open and honest discussion of difficult topics while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintaining diplomacy, good will and having some fun. 
</em><br>
<p>I wish.  But history has shown differently.  For whatever reason, the
<br>
Extropian List has not been able to do so.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; We can maintain the spirit of Crocker's rules while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still being open, diplomatic, kind and honest.
</em><br>
<p>I find that most people quote Crocker's rules as an excuse to participate in
<br>
insulting or ad hominem attacks in violation of the list rules.  I am not
<br>
sure if Crocker's rules and the current list rules are compatible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a thought experiment, think of the most honest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never-tell-a-lie person you can imagine, one who is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also a kind-hearted soul.  Consider him in a typical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianesque no-win situation, translated into an old 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar setting:  &quot;Jesus, do these pants make my butt look fat?&quot;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, he could use my usual technique of feigning an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epileptic seizure, but that in itself is a form of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonesty and they don't fall for it after the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fourth time.  It would be perfectly honest for him to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer with a simple &quot;no&quot;, even if he is actually thinking: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No, those pants dont make your butt look fat.  Its your fat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; butt that makes your butt look fat.&quot;  Notice that a simple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;no&quot; is true, is far more diplomatic, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spares feelings, follows the spirit of Crocker's rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of internet exchange.
</em><br>
<p>This is a straw-man and has nothing to do with insulting behavior or
<br>
personal attacks.  The problem with arguing for &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;, is
<br>
that all attackers are sure they are being truthful and honest in their
<br>
attacks.  Even the 911 terrorists claimed truth, honesty and integrity for
<br>
their actions.  Such a standard, while theoretically sound, is almost never
<br>
useful in practice.  Humans always seem to be able to justify their actions
<br>
in their own minds such that they are the good guys.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We deal with some difficult topics on this list, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I call on people to eschew heated argument in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor of controlled argument.
</em><br>
<p>You can &quot;call&quot; for this all you want, but it never happens.  Why would this
<br>
call be any different?  Seriously, do you think you have just solved our
<br>
problems?  If not, what would be a good solution to stopping flame wars.  I
<br>
think they are self-destructive behavior which nobody wants.  But we do not
<br>
seem to want to stop them either.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ExI's best days are yet before of us.  Let us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cut down on rancor and fan the flames of progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are on the eve of construction.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but let's not just say it as a matter of faith.  Let's take real action.
<br>
What exact changes do you propose to make that will cut down on rancor?  If
<br>
no changes are made, none will occur.
