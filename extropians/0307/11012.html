<p><em>    &gt; Consciusness is an evolved process
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and you need to ask yourself exactly why consciousness evolved. The
<br>
only answer is that it enhances survival and the only way it can do that is
<br>
by changing our behavior and the only way it can do that is by increasing
<br>
our intelligence. Conclusion: Intelligent behavior must be linked to
<br>
consciousness or evolution wouldn't have bothered to come up with it; and I
<br>
know with certainty of at least example where it has done so, me. If
<br>
something acts just like you then it has the same intelligence as you, if it
<br>
has the same intelligence as you then it has the same consciousness as you,
<br>
and if it has the same consciousness as you then it is you.
