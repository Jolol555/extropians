Of course, any rational person would suggest that if *you* did wake up
<br>
in 1936, fifty miles outside of Berline, with a remote control switch
<br>
taht
<br>
would detonate a Hiroshima-sized device in the capitol of Germany, you
<br>
most likely insane @ best; and if not, there is some serious doubt as
<br>
to whether or not ur paricular timeline would occur....or even worse, by
<br>
detonating ur little device, you would be instigating an even more
<br>
costly
<br>
timeline (say Adolph manages to catch on how ur device works, or one of
<br>
his leutinents)....
<br>
<p>Gentlemen, Ladies;
<br>
I propose a radical idea - we're all dead (or going to die) anyway; at
<br>
least 
<br>
at the current stage of development in terms of technologies....
<br>
<p>So why run around hastening each others pathways to the afterlife (if
<br>
there is one),
<br>
on the somewhat faulty reasoning that someone else has already hastened
<br>
someone elses
<br>
pathway to the afterlife.... or worse, probably will hasten someone
<br>
elses pathway to the afterlife.

Subject: Radical Suggestions
<br>
<p><p>Suppose that I suddenly found myself in the year 1936 about fifty miles
<br>
outside Berlin, and I had in my hand a remote control switch that would
<br>
detonate a Hiroshima-sized device in the capital of Germany, and that I
<br>
knew that this would be my only chance to kill Hitler and his henchmen.
<br>
<p>I would scarcely hesitate, even though it would mean the immediate
<br>
deaths of 100,000 people.  I believe that my knowledge of history makes
<br>
it a good enough gamble, and my conscience would allow no other choice.
<br>
Perhaps the lives of as many as 30 million people would be saved by my
<br>
intervention.
<br>
<p>I think that quite a few readers of this list would concur.
<br>
<p>So now let's suppose that it's the year 2065, and a historian in what's
<br>
left of the decimated world civilization sadly
<br>
narrates:
<br>
<p>&quot;What I will never understand is how the United States---the sole, yes
<br>
*sole* superpower of the early years of this century ---allowed the
<br>
world-wide proliferation of nuclear weapons to proceed.  Weren't the
<br>
consequences easily foreseeable?
<br>
<p>&quot;It was in 2003 or 2004 at the latest, that the last best chance was
<br>
missed.  After North Korea obtained its nuclear weapons, Japan and
<br>
Taiwan had no choice but to join the club.  The regime change in Seoul
<br>
in 2009 lit the fuse, of course, and we all know what happened.
<br>
<p>&quot;Just think: imagine that somehow the U.S. had anticipated
<br>
that by 2050 there were going to be six (6) atomic wars, and that
<br>
hundreds of millions of people were going to perish, and civilization
<br>
very nearly along with it.  Would anyone have been brave enough to have
<br>
condoned an unprovoked attack on North Korea, making it perfectly clear
<br>
that proliferation was *not* going to be an option?
<br>
<p>&quot;Probably at the time, no one could have felt confident 
<br>
enough of their logic, not even some of the most clear- thinking
<br>
Extropians in the world.  And had anyone been able to foretell what is
<br>
so obvious to us today, imagine the defamation that they would have had
<br>
to endure.
<br>
<p>&quot;Such an attack would have been almost completely without historical
<br>
precedent, and so necessarily would have struck most people at the time
<br>
as supremely evil.  But had they only known!&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, as I have said, I personally would not recommend
<br>
that any nation execute an unprovoked nuclear attack on
<br>
any other at this time nor in the foreseeable future---
<br>
but I admit the possibility that I could be dead wrong.
