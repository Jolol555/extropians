<p><em>&gt;Ok, now this is less useful too general, I think.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi reason and thanks for your feedback. I might have made an effort to
<br>
determine what the GKES header on this thread meant before posting, but
<br>
instead I simply 'winged-it' based on the remainder of the subject line.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One can assume that we're all interested in grassroots transhumanism, for
</em><br>
example.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have been more specific there. I meant 'meatspace grassroots
<br>
transhumanism'. In other words, I am interested in
<br>
transhumanism-for-dummies-like memes and vectors specifically enabling the
<br>
general non to semi-technical population (or the 'proles' as spike might
<br>
say) in my immediate geographical region (i.e. my salon client base) to
<br>
favorably grasp, participate in, and profit from the project of
<br>
transhumanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What, specifically, are you actually *doing* in the sense of organizing,
</em><br>
running,
<br>
<em>&gt;creating?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty much that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd like to have some sort of lower-bound cut-off off on project
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effort/size on this list in order to keep it useful.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely you meant to type &quot;this thread&quot; not &quot;this list&quot;. This list is for
<br>
the discussion of things relevant to transhumanists and transhumanism. If
<br>
just one other list member finds a part of what I write to be interesting or
<br>
relevant to transhumanism, then what I have written is *useful* by
<br>
definition. And up to eight times a day I might add.
<br>
<p>Ward and ware the patellar reflex to institute &quot;lower-bound cut-off's&quot; with
<br>
regard to list content.
