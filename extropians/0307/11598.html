</em><br>
<p>It's more of a social observation than a law. However, isn't it still
<br>
holding true, in some rough sense? Don't hardware designers take it into
<br>
account when balancing increase in capabilities with time to market? I've
<br>
always though that it was a very interesting self-supporting meme; the more
<br>
people believe it, the more real it is, and so the more people are forced to
<br>
believe (and thus continue to support it). It reminds me of the
<br>
self-reinforcing effects of confidence and of pessimism in a market, but
<br>
seemingly without the dualism of those two (and so without the bust to
<br>
offset the boom).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another interesting parallel to technology here.  Abstraction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool, but in practice it has lead too many people to design bloated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient, unreliable software.  
</em><br>
<p>Off topic and aside, I'll take issue with this point as too one-sided. The
<br>
other side of the coin is that without abstraction, we'd have so little
<br>
software, compared to what we do have today, that we'd be very much poorer.
<br>
Also, the abilities of that software would be miniscule; no distributed
<br>
enterprise apps talking to multiple datasources over many layers of
<br>
protocol, heterogenous networks, on many and varied operating systems on
<br>
varying hardware with wildly different capabilities. Gone are the days of
<br>
understanding the flow of every last byte of information. And that's not so
<br>
bad... for a start, you get a job for life, Harvey :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, I think our ideas about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology have been abstracted to the point that we produce bloated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient and unreliable expectations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This, at least, is what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can salvage from my side of those copy arguments we used to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have.  (I concede.)  And finally, we shovel all the real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems under that carpet we call &quot;software.&quot;  This is part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of that larger Myth of the Computer Age: universality.  We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can do anything in software, given enough speed.  This is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; true in any practical or useful sense, however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed!  The myth I keep running into is the seven-layer model of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networking.  It says that layers are abstracted independently of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other so that the physical, data-link, network, transport, session,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presentation, application layers can all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mix-and-match/plug-and-play/and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be vendor neutral.  It sounds good in theory, but it isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real.  If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were real, we should be able to run a Linux program displaying IBM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EBCDIC characters over an http web session via a non-TCP 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocol on an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appletalk network running Microsoft netbios on an ATM link!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. Does the layer model say that each model is entirely independant of
<br>
each other? Or the truer view, that each layer is based entirely on the
<br>
layer below? And of course there is the realistic addition to this, that the
<br>
idiosyncracies of lower layers bleed through to higher ones when we would
<br>
rather they didn't. Still, I seem to be able to send email from anywhere to
<br>
anywhere, oblivious to the software+hardware used by others (and even mostly
<br>
oblivious to what I am personally using!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I say the following with complete confidence: there will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no Yudkowskian Singularity, the copy is not the original, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creation of the first assembler will not cause an immediate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revolution in manufacturing.  These are science fiction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pipedreams.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that these things will happen eventually.  But they will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carved out with great difficulty at every step of the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology gets more complicated as it grows exponentially.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Layers upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; layers of abstraction make system unpredictable.  Complexities make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing the complete picture more and more impossible.  As technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solves our problems, we are presented with more numerous and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult problems.  Like a video game where you never win, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we just keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advancing to more and more difficult levels.  The work gets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harder, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewards get bigger, the disasters get worse, and the process repeats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself over and over.  There is no end to this process, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why so many people on the Luddite side and on the technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is.
</em><br>
<p>You are dead on about this progression; it's why I've said before that I
<br>
think software development is far more difficult now than it has ever been,
<br>
although our tools and our abstractions race along keeping us barely above
<br>
water (maybe). We are getting to the point, I think, where the increasing
<br>
number of abstraction layers (and interactiosn between orthogonal systems of
<br>
abstraction) is starting to require meta-abstractions to group and hide many
<br>
layers at once, in new ways. Otherwise, the software crunch that we've been
<br>
staving off (quite well!) for so long is going to bite us eventually.
<br>
<p>Also, and interestingly, this is one of the major arguments about
<br>
&quot;progress&quot;... that it is really just very expensive wheel spinning, and that
<br>
socially, we impose ever increasing burdens on ourselves for no useful
<br>
offsetting result. That's one of the reasons people look to technological
<br>
singularity in my opinion; an answer to this criticism of us becoming
<br>
increasingly busy to no effect is the promise of a discontinuity, which will
<br>
actually make all the work leading up to it worthwhile, after all.
<br>
<p>Personally, I feel that the improvements we make, the increases in
<br>
complexity of software, the crazy new challenges we face, are definitely
<br>
worth it. We get little discontinuities all the time; I'm sending this email
<br>
over one of them. The world really has been getting measurably better. The
<br>
next one I'm hanging out for is ubiquitous wireless internet access, with
<br>
large market penetration on GPS (or similar) enabled devices. That is,
<br>
people themselves (rather than desktop PCs) begin to go online in a big way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, and as well as realising that this stuff requires hard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; work, we need a *critical* approach to technology.  We need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to take our heads out of the sand, lose the ridiculous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;luddite&quot; talk, and realise that, yes, technology does effect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; peoples lives, and that, no, not all technology effects all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lives in a positive way.  Technophilia doesn't cut it.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed!  I have come to believe that the Luddites are right in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fears.  This stuff is dangerous and will cause problems.  However, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't believe they are right in their solutions.  We can't just ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stuff or get everybody to agree to relinquish any use of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We must strive to make sure that safety and security are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.  We need to make sure that dangerous technology doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accidentally destroy the world just as we have to make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous terrorists don't deliberately destroy the world.  This takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auditing, accountability, transparency, negotiation and a whole lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitude adjustment.  People who risk massive disasters without taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper precautions are like terrorists.  They risk other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people's lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to achieve their own goals.  They don't care if other people die if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will help them reach their own goals.  There must be a way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Luddites, identify real problems, and then develop solutions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these concerns.
</em><br>
<p>Ooh, you are advocating the complex, intricate, middle ground solution,
<br>
rather than &quot;Everything's going to be great&quot; vs &quot;Everything's going to fall
<br>
into crap&quot;. There's a hard ask. It's a good path for transhumanism to walk,
<br>
though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Technology is ideological in the strongest sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You make a lot of excellent points that I agree with.  Mike Lorrey is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also making other points that I agree with.  Anders said it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best when he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said we are in a phase of &quot;growing up&quot;.  Our college-days of idealism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are gone.  We are in the real world now.  Things aren't as rosy as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought.  We live in a Dilbertesque world, and there are too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointy-haired bosses calling the shots who don't understand what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are talking about.  We want to make a difference, and still want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursue our dreams.  But we have to adapt to the real world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.  The future isn't turning out to be what we expected it to be.

<p>Geez, everyone is so down about this stuff. Admittedly, things aren't up the
<br>
way they were. However, given that the world is at a real low point, the
<br>
fact that it is still difficult to be anything other than at least mildly
<br>
optimistic (in my opinion) about the future of the world (particularly in
<br>
relation to technology over the coming decades, and the transhuman vision),
<br>
is something to cheer about.
