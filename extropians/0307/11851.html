<p>Close -- the MBrain papers (and Anders' related works) indicate that it
<br>
civilizations (past a certain level of complexity) rapidly optimize
<br>
the use of matter &amp; energy within a sphere of influence.  (You may
<br>
call this The Singularity -- you can include it being &quot;managed&quot; --
<br>
by a Friendly AI -- or relatively &quot;unmanaged&quot;, e.g. uploaded individual
<br>
entitites [who probably don't behave as &quot;individuals&quot; today because the
<br>
&quot;melding&quot; of minds will be feasible]).
<br>
<p>The &quot;sphere of influence&quot; probably grows to several light years in
<br>
size over time (if one assumes a &quot;star&quot; is retained as a power source.
<br>
This requires either star-lifting or the cosumption of exo-solar
<br>
system resources (other planets, brown dwarfs, etc.) -- so it probably
<br>
doesn't happen quickly.  (Raises some interesting questions as to
<br>
the behavior of civilizations within globular clusters if such can
<br>
develop...).
<br>
<p>Once you have minimized the power production of your star (and thus
<br>
extended its lifetime as long as current laws of physics allow)
<br>
and grown to the maximal size that available matter and the
<br>
physics of heat radiation allow -- then one has reached an
<br>
evolutionary plateau.
<br>
<p>At that level of development expansion by colonization makes no sense -- 2
<br>
MBrains are not any more intelligent than 1 MBrain (at least if they are
<br>
separated by common interstellar distances).  Having the ability to copy
<br>
&quot;myself&quot; into an MBrain several light years away is of no use to me
<br>
(provided I can reasonably predict the the survival odds of &quot;my&quot; MBrain
<br>
are equal to the survival odds of the &quot;other&quot; MBrain).  In fact one can
<br>
get into a discussion that the energy &amp; matter expended to create the copy
<br>
might actually diminish the survival probability of one or both copies.
<br>
<p>The only path(s) of evolution &quot;above the plateau&quot; would appear
<br>
to be (a) pushing the laws of physics -- e.g. a denser than
<br>
normal form of &quot;computronium&quot;, e.g. a neutronium (or as Anders
<br>
has named it -- a &quot;Chronos&quot;) brain; or (b) trying to drive
<br>
MBrain clusters together in what might ultimately be a
<br>
last gasp of computing before they become a rather large
<br>
black hole.  [One could obviously speculate that galaxies
<br>
with black holes at their core might be the product of the
<br>
computational frenzies of MBrain clusters.]
<br>
<p>[The reason that one cannot get above the intellectual plateaus
<br>
of individual MBrains is that the amount of information they
<br>
contain cannot be efficiently transmitted across interstellar
<br>
distances.  You have to either be content with remaining an
<br>
intellectual island or risk getting very close to communicate
<br>
a large volume of information in a short period of time.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It becomes cheaper and more efficient to stay where they are than it is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expand throughout the universe. Especially since almost unlimited energy can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be drawn from what we would consider finite resources.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree that it isn't cheaper to &quot;expand&quot; -- it may be cheaper to
<br>
plan encounters over a very long period -- say tens of millions of years
<br>
for MBrains to pass near to each other in which case they could open
<br>
high bandwidth communication channels during &quot;close encounters&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'm not so sure I understand the &quot;unlimited energy&quot; point.  One can
<br>
likely lengthen the lifetime of ones sun to trillions of years.
<br>
One can also probably construct stealth entities that have a
<br>
reserve supply of hydrogen, don't think much at all, i.e. all
<br>
computers in &quot;suspend&quot; mode so they produce no heat signature,
<br>
and occupy intergalactic space (where hazards are minimal).
<br>
These will likely be the longest lived entities in the universe --
<br>
but being one of them doesn't sound like a lot of fun.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This change occurs long before the capability to &quot;travel&quot; the universe, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent species tend to stay &quot;close to home&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You don't have to remain close to home -- it becomes a question of &quot;*what*
<br>
do you want to think about&quot; (enter &quot;self-directed evolution&quot; again).
<br>
You can either not think at all (surfing intergalactic space in
<br>
stealth mode) or try to think some transcendent thought (a billion
<br>
MBrains hurling themselves towards a galactic core attempting to compute
<br>
something really beautiful in the last moments of their existence)
<br>
or perhaps many things between those extremes -- but it seems likely
<br>
that you will know what the extremes probably are and will be choosing
<br>
your path among them.  And it seems unlikely (to me) that any of those
<br>
paths will involve sending probes or any other endless self-replication
<br>
strategies.
<br>
<p>(If you haven't read the work by Anders or myself related to this email
<br>
he or I offlist so we can send you the pointers.)
