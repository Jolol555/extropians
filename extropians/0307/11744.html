<p><em>&gt; This is why I work for the Lifeboat foundation, which is the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrated effort out there to ensure the continuation of intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  I have seen little mention of it on the Extropy list, none that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall that I did not bring up.
</em><br>
<p>Always eager to hear more about stuff like this!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Observing this list leads me to the conclusion that many extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take it as blind faith that humanity, and intelligent life, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive, and generally do little to ensure that continues.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you are right----people are, IMO, much too complacent about
<br>
the future.  A study of past human civilizations prompts the question
<br>
&quot;if they can fall, why can't we?&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To them I ask (among other things), what of the Fermi paradox?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where are the rest of the universes intelligent beings?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have still yet to hear any decent counters to the Fermi paradox.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (are there any?)  
</em><br>
<p>I am sure that you have heard the answer that I first read in 1986
<br>
in Tipler and Barrow's book:  Within billions of light years, we
<br>
are the only civilization.  Why don't you consider that a decent
<br>
counter?
<br>
<p>The Drake Equation, as you, know, is just this product of a lot
<br>
of probabilities which taken together is supposed to give some
<br>
kind of overall probability of life developing around some star.
<br>
I've always thought that a kind of kindergarten exercise, 
<br>
because it would only take one near-zero factor to make the
<br>
entire product near-zero.
<br>
<p>To me it's just *obvious* that some one or something within another
<br>
civilization would get a few hundred years past where we are and
<br>
would colonize the universe with Von Neumann probes.  That hasn't
<br>
happened to the Earth, and so there isn't anyone within a few
<br>
billion light-years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If none exist, we should take this as a deep warning.  It leaves only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few possibilities, 1) no other intelligent technologically advanced life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has yet evolved
</em><br>
<p>quite likely IMO
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) it has evolved but has not made it here
</em><br>
<p>also very likely, but they're still hundreds of millions of light-years
<br>
away
<br>
<p>3) it has evolved and it tends to destroy itself
<br>
<p>I would be amazed that the course of civilization would be so
<br>
identical throughout the cosmos.  When one stops to realize the
<br>
uncanny diversity of civilizations just among HOMO SAPIENS, then
<br>
for there to be a common denominator among all non-human 
<br>
civilizations seems fanciful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) it has evolved, is here, and is undetectable.
</em><br>
<p>I've always thought that the most silly possibility.  For what
<br>
reason would they make their presence so difficult to detect?
<br>
If they're made of ordinary matter, there is a lot of energy
<br>
that they are willingly ignoring.
<br>
<p>I can just imagine Europeans in the 15th century asking,
<br>
&quot;how do we know that we have not already ourselves been
<br>
colonized by a great Chinese fleet?&quot;, or wondering &quot;should
<br>
we obey the Prime Directive if we encounter other peoples
<br>
below the equator or on faraway islands?&quot;.
