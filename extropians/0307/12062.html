<p>I still think spike is enjoying a dry technoweenie
<br>
style amusement with the above ongoing theme of
<br>
humanity showing up just in the nick of time and
<br>
saving the planet from carbon exhaustion.  But the
<br>
repeated overconfident and unskeptical acceptance of
<br>
the biogenic (ie, fossil) origin of petroleum and coal
<br>
which underlies the joke has been like an itch that I
<br>
gotta scratch.   
<br>
<p>Ever since Mitch's post:
<br>

<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0306/10577.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0306/10577.html</a>
<br>
<p>---I've been nibbling away at this question.
<br>
<p>I googled up the current theories on planet/sun
<br>
formation from the planetary/solar nebula.  Sought the
<br>
primordial composition of the nebula, and the sequence
<br>
leading from nebular gas/dust to gas/dust disk to
<br>
planetesimals to proto-earth to earth (as well as to
<br>
the sun and other planets).  In the process I took
<br>
note of the current theory seeking to explain the
<br>
different compositions of the different planets,
<br>
innermost to outermost (which, if I got it right, is
<br>
held to be the consequence of a radial temperature
<br>
gradient: hot close in to cold further out).  I came
<br>
to suspect, but couldn't find clear confirmation, that
<br>
the temperature profile had a time factor as well. 
<br>
That is, the original nebula was thought to have a
<br>
(uniform?) temperature of 30-50 deg Kelvin.  Then the
<br>
temperature increased and differentiated concurrent
<br>
with the structural evolution.  I mention this last
<br>
because I was looking for a definite statement of the
<br>
primordial composition of the earth--methane and other
<br>
carbons sources in particular--and the temperature in
<br>
the planetary disk at the various stages of planetary
<br>
formation seemed to me, from what I was reading, to be
<br>
critical.   
<br>
<p>I came to the conclusion that the earth accreted in a
<br>
relatively cool manner.  Coolest early on from small
<br>
cool bits, and getting larger and warmer only
<br>
gradually.  Only later would the planet heat up, as a
<br>
result of the combined effects of radioactive decay
<br>
and heat retention due to size.  As the heat-up
<br>
proceeded, the planet would evolve structurally, part
<br>
of which evolution would be the &quot;outgassing&quot; of
<br>
volatiles.  Primordial volatiles.
<br>
<p>This leads directly to the carbon question.  I'm with
<br>
Thomas Gold on this.  Ain't no dinosaur and
<br>
prehistoric leaf litter involved (I assert).  That
<br>
theory needs a place on the bookshelf reserved for
<br>
historical amusement and humility alongside tomes on
<br>
the flat earth, Phlogiston, spontaneous generation,
<br>
Lamarkian evolution, etc.  Time to move on IMO.
<br>
<p>One more thing.  If the name Thomas Gold provokes in
<br>
any degree an &quot;Oh, that crank!&quot; response, step back
<br>
and take a look at that reflex attitude.  As always,
<br>
an old and comfy habit (of thinking in this case) is
<br>
old, and comfy, but that don't make it true.  Be not
<br>
complacent.
<br>
<p>Also, small recommendation.  The first link below is
<br>
long and dense, the second short and very fun.  Some
<br>
people like to eat dessert first.

<p>&quot;When I am working on a problem I never think about
<br>
beauty. I only think about how to solve the problem.
<br>
But when I have finished, if the solution is not
<br>
beautiful, I know it is wrong.&quot;
