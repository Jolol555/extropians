<p>True. This is in some sense &quot;deep green transhumanism&quot;. When I wrote
<br>
this I was not looking at people, but the Big Picture (TM) - always a
<br>
dangerous thing to do. I wanted to look at our transhumanist vision from
<br>
another angle. We already cover plenty of the technology and human
<br>
benefit perspectives, and this is something our critics often attack. 
<br>
They think we envision a sterile high-tech future where we live like
<br>
posthuman gods in towers of diamond and steel and where all of creation
<br>
is centered on human desires. This image offends the sensibilities of
<br>
many people and makes them see transhumanism as something opposed to the 
<br>
natural and living. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is the statement that many types of life choices will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible and room will be present for all of them.  But there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing about what sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociol/political/psychological/economic/ethical structures would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow/enhance that. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is just the growth and increase possibilities enough?  Or is much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required before we expect the growth in abilities actually leads to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future we wish to inhabit?
</em><br>
<p>Of course we need more than just growth.  What I was really aiming at in
<br>
my vision post was to embrace complexity, and show that complexity needs
<br>
growth. But it is not enough. I'm planning to write a more full analysis
<br>
of the cancer cell/orchid issue, because it is really at the heart of
<br>
the problem. The burning of the cosmic commons in Robin's paper is great
<br>
growth, but it does not seem to lead to much complexity, just more and
<br>
more efficiency at expanding. Here growth and evolution seems to reduce
<br>
complexity instead of enhance them. Under what circumstances do we see
<br>
an evolutionary radiation and the creation of new niches, and under what
<br>
circumstances do we get goo?
<br>
<p>The same goes for human societies. We want societies with room for many 
<br>
life choices - so what kinds of societies produce them, and how can we 
<br>
compare societies (real and imagined)? Good questions. I have my own 
<br>
humanist/liberal/libertarian/game theoretical ideas, but I think we need 
<br>
some new and better metaideas in how to do the analysis.
