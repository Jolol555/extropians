Ok, votes of agreement much appreciated. Since the other frequent posters
<br>
and ExI members here seem to be, ah, otherwise engaged at the moment, I
<br>
figure we'll just get on and do this. Lead from the front and all that. If
<br>
the ExI board folks want input on the miniFAQ and whatnot that'll be posted
<br>
to the forum, they're welcome to jump in :) I'll start a separate thread for
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Since I tend to ramble if I don't bulletpoint, I'll bulletpoint (in a
<br>
rambling way as it turned out):
<br>
<p>1) Dan Fabulich [<a href="mailto:dfabulich@warpmail.net?Subject=RE:%20so%20here's%20what%20I%20think%20this%20list%20needs...">dfabulich@warpmail.net</a>] is hereby dubbed the GKES.
<br>
<p>2) In answer to Aubrey's question, the F stands for something that only my
<br>
subconscious mind truly knows. I really thought I was typing K until I saw
<br>
my remarks quoted.
<br>
<p>3) I am quite happy to take the position myself, so that's a nice backup.
<br>
<p>4) We'll hack out the mini-FAQ and resource list document in a separate
<br>
thread, which is about to be started by yours truly. Everyone gets to have a
<br>
say, and hopefully some interesting comments will emerge.
<br>
<p>5) I will be starting a third (ambitious, me) separate thread for the
<br>
purpose of discussing what it actually is that us folks are doing out in the
<br>
world, as mentioned in item #3 quoted below. This will be a combination of
<br>
declarations, prodding various folks, and so forth. Dan and sundry parties
<br>
can of course take that part of it offline if they so desire, but it seems
<br>
far more entertaining and useful to keep it public. After all, I've been on
<br>
this list for three years or so and I still haven't a clue as to what half
<br>
of the active people here are actually doing to bring on the brave new world
<br>
they're looking for.
<br>
<p>We shall see how this goes. In theory, a week or so should see a pair of
<br>
nice tidy, living documents in Dan's hands that will be posted once a month.
<br>
Or once a week. Or some similar frequency. Let's go do it.

<em>&gt; &gt; In the spirit of getting things done, here is the low-cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solution to this particular problem:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1) Someone becomes Grand Keeper of Extropian Secrets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democratic process and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatnot not really required; duties are not onerous. Should be someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsible and reliable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2) The GFES gets a mission statement/miniFAQ/resource list written. Two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pages should do it. This is posted to the list once a month. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refer to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the CR list at www.calorierestriction.org for a truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of this sort of thing. The purpose of this thing is a) to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the newcomers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; find context, b) to help the oldtimers remember the context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3) The GFES finds out what people are doing. I mean *doing*. Like I run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; www.longevitymeme.org. There are at least twenty or so other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; webmasters I know of who can be said to be *doing* things. Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the Free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; State Project, there are WTA cells all over the place, people organizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conferences, two or three nanotech advocacy groups, some of us are even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; figuring out the internals of the human body or building better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rockets. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mean, there's a lot going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The list of *doing* gets formalized and posted once a month.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With contact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information, brief project descriptions, and How To Help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraphs. As it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; progresses and shows value, the GFES stops having to prod
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they come to the GFES with their updates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds great to me.  One great asset of such an initiative is that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are many (such as myself) who are spearheading key aspects of the futurist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda but to whom reading high-bandwidth lists is a major time sink that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competes with our (presumably valuable) main occupation.  Replying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions that are directed to me personally (and copied to a list if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioner chooses) is a much more efficient approach that I never shirk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from, and I bet numerous others in my position feel the same.  Having my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name/website/activities on such a list would thus be a move in the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction from my point of view.
