<em>&gt; &quot;If cryonics actually makes sense, then everyone will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want it, and it  will cost too much to the community. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We better spend this money on living people during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  their normal life.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This imo hits on a *pivotal* strategic political point for
<br>
transhumanism generally but perhaps more on that latter.
<br>
<p>For now, imo, given the French attitude to 'social health',
<br>
it would be a *mistake* to argue that cryonics makes 
<br>
sense on positive health grounds. (The &quot;health grounds&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;issue is a net loser, in that it is more likely that thawing
<br>
heads and cadivers from failed business ventures or
<br>
voluntary organisations or desparate do-it-yourselfers
<br>
are more likely to spread diseases then buried or burnt
<br>
ones). The event of the failed cryonic facility in the US
<br>
could be brought up. I'd want to have an answer to
<br>
that if I was the lawyer perhaps an example of a poorly
<br>
managed cemetary and so put the point as being about
<br>
management.
<br>
<p>The positive social health case will need to address at
<br>
some point, but not now, not in France. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually I see cryonics as more comparable to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1960s fad for bomb shelters.  If I choose to spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my money on a shelter or cryonics, either way it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  my choice.  It doesn't cost the community anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it dumps my horded wealth back into the community.
</em><br>
<p>That how I'd see it in the US too. But the media looks
<br>
global at cryonics stories. Just about every time an 
<br>
Aussie gets shipped to a facility in the states it makes
<br>
the news here in Australia.
<br>
<p>But I think the economic case coupled with the civil
<br>
liberties (not the liberties of the dead) but of the 
<br>
bereaved could be the way to go in France. 
<br>
<p>Are the French allowed to take out insurance? 
<br>
Entrepreneur is a French word as has been pointed
<br>
out on this list before. Perhaps France is the place
<br>
to make cryonics seriously commercial. 
<br>
<p>If I was in a secular society like France (when the 
<br>
time was right and in my opinion from a business
<br>
standpoint it isn't quite right yet,) I'd do a poll to see
<br>
what the level of demand for cryonics services were,
<br>
I'd also gather data from a credible polling organisation
<br>
on the general level of awareness of cryonics in France
<br>
and of peoples perceptions with respect to it. 
<br>
<p>Armed with that data and the best scientific case I could
<br>
find I'd put together a business plan find myself a
<br>
management team and go looking for capital for what
<br>
would be then just another commercial venture aimed
<br>
at satisfying an unmet commercial demand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From:  Robert J. Bradbury... Someone (spike?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should calculate what the LN2 costs would be to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep a body frozen in a dewar on an annual basis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assuming everything were automated...Robert
</em><br>
<p>[Spike]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; LN2 is cheaper than beer, and it doesn't boil off very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly.  That part of the cost is probably in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise.  The cost is in the rental of the warehouse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space and the capital cost of the dewar.  
</em><br>
<p>What matters (in France and Id argue when cryonics
<br>
as a business ventures time has come -which it hasn't
<br>
yet) is not costs but comparitive costs. 
<br>
<p>Its warehouse space vs cemetary space. Dewar costs
<br>
verses coffin costs. Etc.
<br>
<p>If the body of the deceased is primarily regarded as 
<br>
a health risk in France if its not buried or cremated then
<br>
the answering argument then it needs to be addressed.
<br>
<p>Insurance savvy, usiness planning and a general aura of 
<br>
managerial and commercial competence rather than a
<br>
lest just save this particular corpse is likely to be needed
<br>
to counter the public health concern.
<br>
<p>Maybe frozen head only can be stored more economically
<br>
than a full buried body in a cemetary. During life the
<br>
potential cryonaut takes out insurance its an economic
<br>
thing not a positive public health thing.
<br>
<p>Questions I'd be asking is what are the costs of burial 
<br>
plots in France, how soon do they dig them over or
<br>
recycle them. Its comparative cost that matters not
<br>
actual cost.
<br>
<p>But in this particular case in the situation of Martinot
<br>
the very first question, if he was my relative of mine
<br>
would be, do I try and get him out of the country
<br>
perhaps to the US for storage (is that easier) or do 
<br>
I try and bring forward the commercialisation of 
<br>
cryonics (is the time yet right). I suspect the time
<br>
is not yet quite right as we cannot yet restore
<br>
frozen organs like hearts etc, and there has been no
<br>
&quot;Benny the dog&quot; (Vanilla Sky).
<br>
<p>The first decision is, Martinot as a special case to
<br>
&quot;save&quot; Martinot or Martinot as a symbol or a cause
<br>
that's time has come. 
<br>
<p>BTW. I think cryonics or uploads for the masses
<br>
will probably need to be a commercial phenomenon
<br>
at some time for transhumanisms time to come.
