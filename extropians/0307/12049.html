</em><br>
<p>Frak Robin this is a complicated analogy.  I my book your
<br>
hubris rating just went up a couple of points -- Eliezer's
<br>
comments aside.
<br>
<p>So, looking at the question...
<br>
<p>&quot;why don't the meta-foxes eat the rabbits?&quot;
<br>
<p>Because they don't have to.  Neither the foxes, nor the meta-foxes
<br>
have to eat the rabbits.  In my knowledge base its generally
<br>
accepted that eating plant protein sources rather than animal
<br>
protein sources is about an order of magnitude more efficient (in
<br>
terms of the raw energy resources that went into the protein
<br>
production).  The foxes (and meta-foxes) would engineer themselves
<br>
to eat grass (if they were initially unable to do so).
<br>
<p>Now I could be completely missing the point of this proposal.
<br>
Looking at the alternate question...
<br>
<p>From a simple &quot;biological&quot; standpoint &quot;Why focus on a few hard
<br>
to catch foxes?&quot; the answer is &quot;because you are designed by natural
<br>
evolution such that the foxes are essential to your survival&quot;.
<br>
Humans require essential vitamins that are produced by bacteria
<br>
and other organisms and can at this point only be obtained by
<br>
serving as a host (for the bacteria) or consuming (e.g. fruits
<br>
for Vit. C) products which provide those necessary nutrients.
<br>
<p>For the proposed scenario to make the points I think you are trying
<br>
to make I think you have to add some strong constraints (like the
<br>
foxes and meta-foxes are not aware of more efficient resources
<br>
or foxes and meta-foxes are not able to modify themselves to
<br>
take advantage of such resources).  It seems (to me) very
<br>
difficult to assert that an advanced technological civilization
<br>
(i.e. one capable of interstellar travel) would lack such
<br>
capabilities.
<br>
<p>Of course I may be completely misunderstanding the direction
<br>
of the scenario -- in which case ignore all of the above.
<br>
