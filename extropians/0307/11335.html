Peter McCluskey writes about <a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/</a>:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I'm unconvinced by the TCS claims about what obligations parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have towards their children, as illustrated by this attitude towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carnivorous children:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   The vegetarian who believes that meat eating ought to be legal ought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   to buy it for their child and give them the respect they would give
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   another human being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't see any argument that this view is better than the more standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view that the parental payment for the food gives them substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority to influence what their children eat, just as it would if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were feeding adult friends. Did anyone see an argument that I missed?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that someone feeding adult friends on a long-term basis
<br>
does in fact have the authority to influence what they eat, especially
<br>
if for some reason the friends can't leave (say, they are disabled and
<br>
under the care of the food-preparer).
<br>
<p>Parents are financially obligated to their children, hence the parents'
<br>
payments for child-related expenses must be counted against those
<br>
obligations and don't have the same status as payments offered freely
<br>
and voluntarily.
