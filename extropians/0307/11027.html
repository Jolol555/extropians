</em><br>
<p>(I've snipped the rest of what you said; I need to think about it more, and
<br>
get back to it)
<br>
<p>I postulate that I is something; that's my axiom. I exist. I am, and I am
<br>
something, therefore something exists.
<br>
<p>As I've said, I could start from &quot;Something exists&quot;, but it wont change the
<br>
fact the &quot;I exist&quot; would also be axiomatic; I know it to be true (that's the
<br>
point of this whole discussion).
<br>
<p>What it all highlights is that &quot;I am&quot; produces &quot;I am not&quot;. ie: the big &quot;I&quot;
<br>
concept just can't be consistent, as many philosophies seem to have
<br>
acknowledged (further, to have been based upon).
<br>
<p>***
<br>
<p>Why I bring this up is the following: If there is no &quot;I&quot;, if &quot;I&quot; am merely a
<br>
self-reinforcing, self replicating pattern of information, what is my driver
<br>
to prolong the existence of said pattern? Why would I want to continue it,
<br>
or copy it? 
<br>
<p>In other words, if there is no self, then why do I care about life
<br>
extension, uploading, issues of teleportation or even staying alive one more
<br>
minute? What is (can be) the point of it, if all I am is bits in the
<br>
information maelstrom?
