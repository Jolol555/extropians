<em>&gt;Randy, I can see how you might say that. Agreed, a lot of PC 'goodness' in our

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think we have lost touch with our past and our biological destiny.
<br>
Most cultures used to have a tradition of taking teenagers out of the
<br>
family setting when they start acting up at &quot;a certain age&quot; (such as
<br>
12-15 years of age). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It varied from culture to culture.  One culture might force the
<br>
teenager to go live in a male barracks, where the older males make
<br>
them into men, none too gently. 
<br>
<p>Another tribe or culture might force him out of the village and into a
<br>
long journey.  Young male humans are NOT evolved to be sitting in a
<br>
classroom at 13.  They are evolved to undertake arduous trials and
<br>
rituals and work.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt;I guess you might want to call me paranoid, but I could see this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being donewith other disagreeing parties. They (Tranquility) don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just stop their &quot;treatment&quot; at 18, the article makes extremely clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They induce complianceat that point with financial rewards - or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;punishments, if you prefer to look at it in that light.
</em><br>
<p><p>These are schools for problem kids who hate their parents, who hate
<br>
school, who are getting in trouble with drugs, etc etc etc, 
<br>
<p>They are not deprogramming outfits for adults.  They are places where
<br>
kids are disciplned roughly until they are damned glad to see their
<br>
parents and go back to a safe suburban life . They are the quick,
<br>
cheap and dirty version of military schools, but these schools are
<br>
beyond the reach of western legal systems. From the perspective of a
<br>
former teacher of kids 12-14, this sounds like a very good idea.
