<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;.  I propose to do away with all stupid
<br>
creatures, and, in fact, probably most matter
<br>
that is not itself intelligent and capable of
<br>
getting along quite nicely without pain.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So all bacteria, mammals, reptiles and birds will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exterminated, uploaded, uplifted?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, much in the way that when you built your house
<br>
---or hired mercenaries to do it for you---all the
<br>
ants and bacteria living where the concrete foundation
<br>
is got snuffed.
<br>
<p>The reason that I don't have a problem with that is
<br>
that the space is being infinitely better used by
<br>
having you there.  Take that as a compliment!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just hung on your particular phrase, and am wondering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what would you replace them with and when?
</em><br>
<p>My vision is that *all* matter get smarts, and enjoy
<br>
life to its fullest.  Even my arm is dead.  It's nothing
<br>
but blood vessels, bone, and muscle that is necessary
<br>
(due to current technological limitations) to keep me
<br>
alive and able.
<br>
<p>All matter should be *at least* as feeling and thoughtful
<br>
as your own best 10 cc's of brain tissue.  And with 
<br>
miniaturization, I'm sure that even our brains at present
<br>
are largely wasteful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, I could see Robert's original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contention that he considered back in 2001, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with Al Qeida and militant Islam. I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see reasons against doing a nuclear strike; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on reason, I can also see where such an action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might become inevitable! Therefore, my view is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere intelligence is not the complete answer.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not following you.  However, perhaps you mean:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer might be, 'Intelligent enough to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workable ethics.'
</em><br>
<p>Well, what's the matter with *our* ethics, that is 
<br>
human ethics?  IMO there are very few really evil
<br>
people.  I have never met anyone who I think would
<br>
not make a good God.  (Yes, some people would be 
<br>
better than others, but no one I have ever met would
<br>
dish out disaster and hardship the way old Jehovah
<br>
does.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But simple intellectual talent does not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring a more peaceable world. Or have I missed your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, completely?
</em><br>
<p>Given that there exist states of matter so advanced 
<br>
that a few cubic centimeters of it could emulate our
<br>
entire civilization sans the really unpleasant stuff,
<br>
why not convert the whole solar system to that?
<br>
<p>It would be a crime in my book to leave any matter
<br>
whatsoever out of that equation---and that certainly
<br>
includes mindless trees and insects.
<br>
