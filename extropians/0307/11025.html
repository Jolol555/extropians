</em><br>
<p>I think (but am not sure) you are mixing up your levels of
<br>
&nbsp;abstraction. 
<br>
<p>I (undefined and possibly including *nothing*) exist 
<br>
does *not* imply that *something* exists. 
<br>
<p>Something exists is the axiom it should be on the left in
<br>
your statement above. &quot;you&quot; know &quot;you&quot; exist as
<br>
&quot;something&quot; but not what you exist as.
<br>
<p>The whole point of substitution the I with something was to
<br>
acknowledge that the self the I may not be a fundamental 
<br>
or elemental thing. But there is &quot;some&quot; elemental thing 
<br>
which &quot;you&quot;, in your case, take as truth or you cannot, 
<br>
develop a concept of self, indeed you could not suspend 
<br>
disbelief in the existence of an external world long 
<br>
enough even to have learn its language. The words &quot;self&quot;
<br>
and &quot;solipsism&quot; are older than you. But you have learnt
<br>
to imbue them with meaning as all of us do. I think this 
<br>
is because they have utility for you and you were a
<br>
social creature before you knew it. 
<br>
<p>What that &quot;something&quot; is that exists can remain undefined
<br>
because you know it exists experientially not just
<br>
intellectually. From infanthood when you were not even
<br>
aware where your self ended and the world started your
<br>
would have created a division between yourself and the
<br>
world as a sort of thesis, tried it, found it worked for you
<br>
and then moved into it. Later your body got boundaries of
<br>
movement control and pleasure pain sensing, and still latter
<br>
you got language. And the whole social interaction thing
<br>
became possible (actually that was happening pre-language). 
<br>
<p>Some-thing can exist at the same time as no-thing exists
<br>
because the references are to two different domains. 
<br>
Some-thing and no-thing in the same domain is a 
<br>
contradiction and breaks contingency but contingency
<br>
is not violated if the domains are different. 
<br>
<p>Shit now I am talking clear as mud. :-)
<br>
<p>Ignore me if I am not helping.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett.
