<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ### ....Of course, the effectiveness of the legal system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; impaired by the fact that the state owns and operates 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; courts, instead allowing private courts to operate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; compete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So you have slow, expensive courts bound by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; statutes and regulations, but this is just another argument for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the free market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see how the free market can be given unfettered free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; range without destroying itself. Like a fire that doesn't stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the fireplace, but burns the house down. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How, exactly, would it destroy itself?
</em><br>
<p>I'm using free in the widest sense of the word where 
<br>
essentially the strong holders of capital are free to exploit
<br>
the weak providers of minimal cost labour across national
<br>
borders if they so choose. 
<br>
<p>Labor, especially unskilled labor can be purchased by large
<br>
multinations essentially anywhere in the world. Capital is pretty
<br>
portable. Multinationals can regime shop for the best tax and
<br>
cost of production packages from a variety of governments that
<br>
want to attrack investment and even in free countries create
<br>
jobs for the locals and increase their chance of being elected.
<br>
<p>Essentially the problem is that in a global system capital flows
<br>
far more easily that labor. The market is free but only is some
<br>
respects. And unless labour can move from one country to
<br>
another with relative ease the labor market is not free. 
<br>
<p>And this means that cheap labor in say the US cannot compete
<br>
on price with cheap labor in say Malaysia. The States will quite
<br>
rightly in my view insist of safety standards for its workers and 
<br>
this lifts the cost of the workforce. In countries where a injured
<br>
worker is essentially just tossed aside for another the labor 
<br>
force is cheap.
<br>
<p>I guess my point in nutshell is, in the absence of giving labor
<br>
the ability to wander across any borders they wish to get the
<br>
work they'd be willing to do at the price they'd be willing to
<br>
do it, which would see immigration to the west in sqillions,
<br>
the next best thing is to ensure that minimal safety standards
<br>
(for one thing) are a cost all countries have to bear so that
<br>
labor competes on a level playing field. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Seem to me that some of the problems of globalis[ation]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arise because the free market is expected to work without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the rule of law being established first. The free market may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allow slavery, human rights abuses (safe work environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc) and the removal of the forms of institution that give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; societies order if it is not checked to some extent. Imo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyway, I'd be interested to see how an alternative view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might run.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A free market would not allow slavery, ipso facto. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm probably using a wider interpretation of free market than
<br>
you had in mind. For the most part I am for as much freedom 
<br>
as possible. I'm pretty much a libertarian. But occassionally
<br>
competition just makes for waste. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If workers are not free to leave employment, they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a free market. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed and in the global cheap labour market, the cheap
<br>
labor is not free to move to any country it likes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is, however, the responsibility of employees to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own best long term rational self interest. In areas where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploitation of  ignorance is possible by capital, collective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bargaining via unions is a legitimate and libertarian means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising up the awareness of the proletariat so that they can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act as self-responsible individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is rather obvious that those in our economy left most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant are those educated by the state apparatus. Whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this be at the hands of  mercantilists looking to exploit or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialists looking to launch  revolution (probably a bit of both),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it is also rather obvious that even in the area of education, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free markets produce the highest quality products and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the happiest workers.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure but I think you are thinking of the US as the market
<br>
whereas I am thinking of a global market place. In the second
<br>
there is no US constitution protecting most of the population.
<br>
<p>And there can be strong commercial pressures for superfunds
<br>
chasing the best return on investment and multinationals seeking
<br>
the cheapest locations to construct their products to seek 
<br>
out manufacturing locations where the protections of the US
<br>
constitution don't apply. 
<br>
<p>Now if this is pushed to far the US unskilled workers find they 
<br>
can't get work. But they can still vote (including voting themselves
<br>
money). My point is eventually this can destabilise even a country
<br>
like the US.
