to set a precedent that will serve as a stepping stone for a world police

system, a coalition of many nations providing troops, money, logistics, etc., but 
<br>
led by the U.S. and outside the U.N. or NATO.&quot;

<p>Phil,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W has said what he is doing.  He is reacting to 911 and determined to 
<br>
pull down the full structure of Al Qaida and all of its support structures.  
<br>
As to this world police system when the UN was unwilling to help him he found a 
<br>
coalition of the willing -- the man was quite willing to get help where he 
<br>
could.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to unannounced motives for his various actions I do believe there 
<br>
is one motive that no one seems to have recognized in his attack on Iraq.  It 
<br>
seems to me that Iraq is in a strategic location for his follow up moves.  All 
<br>
I know is what I read in the papers but it appears those moves have been 
<br>
succeeding for a month and more.  The middle eastern newspapers, which I keep 
<br>
urging everyone to read occasionally, have even become noticeably less anti 
<br>
American over the last two months.
