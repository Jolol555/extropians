<em>&gt; &gt; No idea. But it is crucial to my argument above that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; functions of intelligence seem to be fulfilled (or fulfillable at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least) by non-concious mundane algorithms, implemented in wetware or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other physical substrates. This is my quandry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### But are you sure that the algorithms are not conscious? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them? (this is not mocking, just pointing out that our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conviction about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people's being conscious also depends on analysis of behavior).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would think that a visual algorithm capable of assigning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color to objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. analyzing the visual scene to assign putative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflectances to objects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not merely measuring the spectral characteristics of patches 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scene, like a spectrophotometer would) does have a subjective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color, indistinguishable from the experience of some parts of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our occipital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cortex (separate from the rest of the brain).
</em><br>
<p>Is this part of the Strong AI conjecture? I think so. I guess if you allow
<br>
that consciousness is a continuum, indivisible from the algorithm that
<br>
conjures it, and based on its complexity, then you could propose some kind
<br>
of consciousness for any algorithm. I wonder how it feels to be a bubble
<br>
sort? Probably not like much at all; no self awareness.
<br>
<p>That's something to think about while I'm banging out yet another business
<br>
app.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I rather think that &quot;I&quot; is a side effect of certain information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; flows, maybe even atemporal states of mathematical entities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think Egan postulated something like this in Permutation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; City... we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are arrangements of information, and the permutations on the way you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interpret physical entities to be arranged are infinite, therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything internally consistent exists somewhere as a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mapping from some piece of reality to the target pattern (although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think the mapping would often require more information than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; target pattern embodies).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But if you believe this, then identity really disappears in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a puff of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logic. Why would we even bother with this reality if we always exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the greater platonic pattern space?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Because &quot;not bothering&quot; results in unpleasant subjective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, what do you mean by &quot;existence&quot;? Minds which do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother to exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a smaller measure in this platonic pattern space, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other minds be a reason enough to bother.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal
</em><br>
<p>Well, wait up there. An infinite space can't really be partitioned like
<br>
that. You either take up none of it, or a finite subset of it, or an
<br>
infinite subset of some order equal to or less than its order. Is it clear
<br>
that making the effort to exist, or to make sure that there are 10 copies of
<br>
yourself rather than 1 actually impacts in any way on the space of
<br>
possibilities in any meaningful way?
<br>
<p>As to unpleasant consequences, that seems like a rather sad
<br>
punishment-avoidance motivation, unworthy of a rational being. Exist because
<br>
you are scared to not. Yuck.
<br>
<p>Arguments about striving to survive because we evolved to (as brought up by
<br>
Brett), are explanatory, but not sufficient for justification in the light
<br>
of a philosophy (transhumanism) which rejects the constraints of naturally
<br>
selected mental structures. Wanting life because we evolved to want it isn't
<br>
really good enough. Is there a better reason?
