<p>The final irony
<br>
<p>'Isn't it ironic?' You hear it all the time - and, most of the time,
<br>
actually no, it isn't. Hypocritical, cynical, lazy, coincidental, more
<br>
likely. But what is irony and why did pundits think it would die two
<br>
years ago, after September 11? Zoe Williams meticulously, sincerely,
<br>
unironically, hunts it down
<br>
<p>&lt;big snipperoo&gt;
<br>
<p>Irony and America
<br>
<p>There are a few reasons why we think the Americans have no sense of
<br>
irony. First, theirs is rather an optimistic culture, full of love of
<br>
country and dewy-eyed self-belief and all the things that Europe's
<br>
lost going through the war spindryer for the thousandth time. This is
<br>
all faith-based - faith in God, faith in the goodness of humanity, etc
<br>
- and irony can never coexist with faith, since the mere act of
<br>
questioning causes the faith fairy to disappear. Second, they have a
<br>
very giving register that, with a sense of irony, would be
<br>
unsustainable (how can you wish a stranger a nice day with a straight
<br>
face?). Third, because we think Canadian Alanis Morissette is
<br>
American, and she proved some time ago, with her song Ironic, that she
<br>
didn't know what irony meant (this is so ironic - first, because we
<br>
think we're the more sophisticated and yet don't know the difference
<br>
between America and Canada, second because America sees Canada as such
<br>
a tedious sleeping partner, and yet Canada is subversively sending
<br>
idiots into the global marketplace with American accents. Of course,
<br>
I'm being ironic. Canadian accents are not the same as American ones!)
<br>
<p>In fact, this is absolute moonshine, since the consummate and
<br>
well-documented superiority of US telly over British telly is largely
<br>
due to their superior grasp of irony (as well as the fact that they
<br>
have more cash). Take, for instance, the opening sequences of Six Feet
<br>
Under versus the opening sequences of Casualty - they both start every
<br>
episode with a vignette in which a stranger dies a horrible death or
<br>
suffers a hideous accident. In Six Feet Under, this will never be
<br>
straightforward - the porn star will never die because her silicon
<br>
implants explode, she will die in some way that could happen to
<br>
anyone; the wheezing, scared-looking sportsman will turn out to have
<br>
been just a bit thirsty, while his amazingly strong team-mate will be
<br>
dying in the background from heat stroke. There's always some cosmic
<br>
irony, swiftly followed by ironic dialogue. In Casualty, on the other
<br>
hand - man leaves pub in middle of day; commences dangerous-looking
<br>
welding job; burns own eye out in drunk accident. Dur. 
<br>
<p>etc.
