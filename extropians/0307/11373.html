</em><br>
<p>Most of what academia has produced isn't yet on the web.  In phil see Mele, 
<br>
in psych see Paulhaus, in evol psych see Trivers (all cited in 
<br>
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a>).  (Some experts coming to my conference 
<br>
are Robert Frank, Jay Hamilton, Dennis Krebs, Robert Kurzban, Al Mele, 
<br>
Harold Sackeim, Robert Trivers, Bill von Hippel.) (I expect you 
<br>
over-estimate your philosophy abilities, but then most people do.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;There are two classic ways to determine what people &quot;really&quot; want.  One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is based on &quot;happiness,&quot; the other on informed choice.  ...  The informed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;choice metric asks whether people would choose status/power or good for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the tribe if they were briefly and privately informed, via enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;evidence to typically be persuasive to a neutral observer, ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why do you think the informed choice metric runs this way?  I would guess 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the opposite - that most people, asked to make a deliberate choice between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;status/power and the good of the tribe, would either choose the good of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the tribe, or feel guilty about not doing so (implying that their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;renormalized volition would move in the direction of choosing the good of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the tribe).
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree that many would feel guilty, but I'm not sure your 
<br>
implication follows.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, if you are talking about a major upheaval in the belief system there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is no such thing as a &quot;briefly informed&quot; choice - you have to extrapolate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;major changes within the person's volition, including reactions to many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different changes and compounded choices about those reactions.
</em><br>
<p>I limited my claim to the sorts of things we've seen.  We've seen how 
<br>
people behave if briefly informed.   We haven't seen your ideal of fully 
<br>
informed post-upheaval choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would reject both metrics as adequate theories of volition or even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instantaneous want, though the informed choice metric comes closer.
</em><br>
<p>The question is what you would put in their place.  There are huge and long 
<br>
traditions in economics and philosophy, among other places, discussing how 
<br>
to describe what people &quot;really&quot; want.  This is another of those areas that 
<br>
you shouldn't try to reinvent before surveying what has been done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;... most people do believe that they want to do good for the tribe.  My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;claim is that this belief is relatively isolated and ineffectual; it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;allowed to influence what people say and some actions that influence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;social perceptions, but is otherwise little used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is the justification for taking such a dark view of things?  Why make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this claim?
</em><br>
<p>This is my reading of what the data tell us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The folk picture of people struggling between their high moral aspirations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and their inner demons is, as far as I can tell, pretty much correct.
</em><br>
<p>The folk picture that most people are much more concerned about appearing 
<br>
moral than being moral is also pretty much correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;People die saving unrelated children.  Is that a lie?
</em><br>
<p>That is a pretty rare phenomena.  It is rarer still in situations where 
<br>
people know they will die, and know they cannot not gain social approval 
<br>
from doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My own claim is that if you asked people what they cared about, what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mattered most to them, what kind of person they wanted to be, they would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that the altruism is the most important part of them.  Since that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what they tell me, why should I - or any friend of theirs - contradict 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them?  The deliberative system may sometimes be weak, but it is ultimately 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in charge - or at least is the center I look to, to determine how to find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;person&quot; I want to &quot;help&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>This is the heart of our dispute.  As in discussions of whether the upload, 
<br>
or its copy, would &quot;really be you&quot;, there is an element of definition or 
<br>
choice in looking into a complex contradictory person and saying what their 
<br>
&quot;real&quot; preferences are.  If you aren't going to appeal to any criteria 
<br>
about why this is a good choice, but just declare it by definition, then 
<br>
there isn't much more to talk about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Then why am I, who know more of my own motives, who see more of puppet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strings, more effectively altruistic and not less?  ...
</em><br>
<p>If you're going to challenge every theory in psychology to explain every 
<br>
case, such as why I got up at 8:00am instead of 8:10am on Tuesday, we're 
<br>
never going to get anywhere.  First try to explain overall trends, then try 
<br>
to explain deviations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;When would you say that a corporation that consistently continues to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;pollute, even though its PR denies it, &quot;really wants&quot; to not pollute?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I wouldn't *use* the term &quot;want&quot; for a corporation.  ... Also the above 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not seem to be a good example of self-deception, just simple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deliberate lying.
</em><br>
<p>Corporations, and other organizations can have behavior that is very much 
<br>
like individual self-deception.  So its too bad that you reject such 
<br>
examples, as they are much easier to analyze.
<br>
<p>Also closely related is the question of what a nation &quot;wants.&quot;  You see, it 
<br>
seems that in many ways the voting/politics person within us makes 
<br>
different choices than we do personally.   Personally you might buy foreign 
<br>
products, or hire a foreign worker, but politically you might want to 
<br>
prohibit them.  It is not just that people may be ignorant about social 
<br>
processes; our political selves seem to have different preferences from our 
<br>
non-political selves!  Politically, we talk as if we are more 
<br>
high-minded.  So which selves should political outcomes correspond 
<br>
to?  Should people get the products they would want as ordinary people, or 
<br>
the products they say they want as political people?
