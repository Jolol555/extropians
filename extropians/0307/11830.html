<p>
AI has been solved.  Or has it?  Surf/lurk/re-turf the debate at
<br>
<a href="http://www.ai-forum.org/topic.asp?forum_id=1&amp;topic_id=8385">http://www.ai-forum.org/topic.asp?forum_id=1&amp;topic_id=8385</a>v.)
<br>
<p>Response by Mentifex/ATM to a request for evidence of AI solution:
<br>
<p><a href="http://mentifex.virtualentity.com/jsaimind.html">http://mentifex.virtualentity.com/jsaimind.html</a> is a solution because
<br>
it is a thinking, functioning Mind that illustrates a Theory of Mind.
<br>
The Mind-1.1 AI is very primitive, but it does indeed think.  It is
<br>
not a standard &quot;chatterbot&quot; that &quot;fakes&quot; the thinking in order to
<br>
carry on a pleasant and amusing conversation with the interlocutor.
<br>
The True AI carries on a maddeningly stupid conversation because
<br>
it knows so little:  a few innate concepts, and what you tell it.
<br>
<p>[A question of what the Mentifex AI can actually do.]
<br>
<p>Even before installation in a robot, an AI going just a little beyond
<br>
<a href="http://mind.sourceforge.net/jsaimind.html">http://mind.sourceforge.net/jsaimind.html</a> -- AI4U Mind-1.1 --  can be
<br>
built to embody a special knowledge base (KB) in any chosen domain.
<br>
<p>A mentifex-class AI such as Mind.Forth or a Mind.XYZ derivative
<br>
can be installed in a robot as a mind aloof from its own motorium
<br>
at first, then awakening like a human baby to its motor options
<br>
as the quasi-parent human-in-charge &quot;scales up&quot; the motorium.
<br>
<p>[A question of how the AI might &quot;scale up&quot; into usefulness.]
<br>
<p>On the contrary, I (Arthur) am actually waiting for the various
<br>
commercially available &quot;hobby&quot; robots to &quot;scale up&quot; to the basic
<br>
<a href="http://mind.sourceforge.net/mind4th.html">http://mind.sourceforge.net/mind4th.html</a> memory requirements :-)
<br>
<p>The popular LEGO (R) Mindstorms robot, which can already run
<br>
<a href="http://www.hempeldesigngroup.com/lego/pbForth/index.html">http://www.hempeldesigngroup.com/lego/pbForth/index.html</a> Forth,
<br>
will be an ideal platform for Mind.Forth as soon as a scaled-up
<br>
Mindstorms robot comes out with substantially more user-programmable
<br>
memory space than the current (ca. 2003) limit of about 28K RAM.
<br>
<p>Give me a LEGO (R) Mindstorms that affords, say, 128 K of RAM
<br>
for the robot hobbyist to load in both an AI Mind and its data,
<br>
and I will hasten to release an initial AI native to the robot,
<br>
i.e. one which thousands of robot-loving tinkerers will soup up,
<br>
scale up and use for oneupsmanship at all the robotics meetings.
<br>
<p>The AI4U Mind-1.1 currently on the Web is merely a curiosity,
<br>
a novelty, something worth of a desultory click-to-enliven.
<br>
As soon as the commercially available hobby robots catch up
<br>
just a little with the RAM memory and CPU width of a personal
<br>
computer (PC) or even a personal digital assistant (PDA),
<br>
then a basic Seed AI released into the robotics gene pool
<br>
will become an uncontrollable branch of AI Mind evolution.
<br>
<p>Do NOT underestimate the unstoppable power of the amateur
<br>
roboticist to take a primitive but free artificial Mind and
<br>
to &quot;Frankenstein&quot; it into:  Behold! The Singularity.
