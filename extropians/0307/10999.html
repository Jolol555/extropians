There are much easier ways to do that than with TMS, so it's not 
<br>
something I've focussed on. I tend to try to find the gentlest way to do 
<br>
things wherever possible, being, by nature, a bit of a wimp.

Yes and no; although the effects of TMS as treatment for, say,  
<br>
depression for example, only last for a short while,  side effects are 
<br>
rare enough to make it worthwhile despite the need for repetitive 
<br>
treatments. There are a lot of different _reasons_ for depression (and 
<br>
addiction,) however, and TMS treatment has to treat the cause, not the 
<br>
symptom, to be of any real use. Otherwise,  if recreational drug users 
<br>
could get the same 'high' from TMS without the side effects of drugs, 
<br>
they too would not mind the need for repetitive 'treatments'. In fact, 
<br>
it could be a lot more addictive than drugs, if it weren't for the 
<br>
infernal noise (imagine the Zip drive's 'Click of Death' at about 
<br>
100db)  and the fact that it won't fit in your bag if you wanna go down 
<br>
the disco. Oh, and your 'leccy bill.

I'm sorry, I wouldn't touch that one with a twenty foot bargepole  :  )
<br>
...No, okay, I would, but only to say that most people's view of 
<br>
'memory' is not quite the reality of what is going on...I _don't_ want 
<br>
to start another 'simulation' argument in any way but from my point of 
<br>
view 'memory' is a simulation anyway. It isn't a constant, but changes 
<br>
every time you use it. The validity of any memory, 'reactivated' or 
<br>
otherwise, is highly suspect unless it can be checked against verifiable 
<br>
facts.
