</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurances, depending on your profesionnal status.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you are free to contract anything you like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside of this of course.
</em><br>
<p>Then as is done in the US policies could be written
<br>
that make cryonics institutes the beneficiaries and
<br>
cryonics in general (as opposed to the Martinot
<br>
situation specifically) need not become about publicly
<br>
financing the costs for a procedure for all who want
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The first decision is, Martinot as a special case to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;save&quot; Martinot or Martinot as a symbol o[f] a cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that's time has come.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Regarding the first option, I have transmitted to Rémy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the doc for Alcor and CI, and personal messages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; / proposals from related people. So I think it is his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice.
</em><br>
<p>In what state is Martinot now? Is he in a morgue, frozen
<br>
etc?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regarding the second option, whether the time has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come or not business-wise, the fact is, there will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement, and a jurisprudence from this judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (= there will be a tendency to re-judge in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way the next cases).
</em><br>
<p>Of course, any entrepreneur considering the risks of
<br>
starting a commercial cryonics facility in France now
<br>
versus later would have to factor that as a variable.
<br>
But it would not imo be a particularly high priority in
<br>
relation to other commercial risks. Of interest would
<br>
be whether there are also laws prohibiting the export
<br>
of the dead and how wide would be the jurisdiction of
<br>
the courts decision. It would be a problem perhaps if
<br>
it was to apply to the EU generally. But such seems
<br>
extremely unlikely.
<br>
<p>It is my understanding that there are no for profit
<br>
cryonics organisations anywhere and that at this
<br>
stage cryonics is sustained by volunteers and true
<br>
believers of which so far there are relatively few as
<br>
a portion of the population.
