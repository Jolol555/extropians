<em>&gt; &gt; Logic and reason have as some of their main benefits the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reconcile conflicting views.  If people can agree on their premises,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then ideally, using logic, they can come to agreement on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conclusions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But how can this work with emotions, with instincts?  Suppose I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; share the senator's repugnance?  Which of us is right, and which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong? What mechanism can we use to resolve these differences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opinion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I suppose, in practice, we would just say that majority rules.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most people share the moral repugnance of the Senators, then they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right. If instead people instinctively thought that the market's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; potential benefits were worthy enough, then the supporters of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; futures market are right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not that happy with a rule like this, that the majority is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right.  But what else can we do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Use some form of consequentialist ethics to derive rules of conduct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently of intuitions about the propriety of majority rule.
</em><br>
<p>I'm always impressed with your urge to create new systems from whole
<br>
cloth.  Do you think that you might have been a follower of Lenin in
<br>
the early days?
<br>
<p>Actually, I doubt that ideal systems exist for humans as presently (or
<br>
probably ever) constituted.  But even if they did, how would we ever 
<br>
adopt one?  This is the key to understanding the situation IMO.  We
<br>
clearly couldn't just &quot;vote&quot; on it in a referendum, for reasons I
<br>
hope are obvious to everyone here.
<br>
<p>We ought to be proud of the political accomplishments of the last 
<br>
four hundred years.  We need to respect the traditions thus evolved,
<br>
and slowly guide them towards the main chances that we see.  (On this
<br>
list, those main chances include immortality, great happiness for
<br>
great numbers of people, and advancing evolution towards information
<br>
singularity.)  We simply have to convince as many others as possible
<br>
that this is the best course, and getting their willing advice and
<br>
consent.
