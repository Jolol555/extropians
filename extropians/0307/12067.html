John Clark reminds us that most SF situations are contrived
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In 1936 you would know that Hitler was a very bad person but the trouble is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would not know that very soon he would cause the death of 30 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people; nor in 1936 would you know if incinerating the German capital would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to something even worse than Hitler by demonstrating to the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9 years early that nuclear weapons are possible and practical.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  I am disappointed that some on this list refuse to
<br>
deal with the real implications of *hypothetical* situations
<br>
but instead yield to the urge to lecture me on the difference
<br>
between reality and hypotheses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even today I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, finally some substance!  Were the *hypothetical* situation
<br>
that I, the time traveler were near Berlin in 1936, indeed I am
<br>
quite confident that I would know what to do.  But others have
<br>
spoken of killing Hitler as early as 1923 or even as a child,
<br>
which is IMO not taking historical complexity enough into account.
<br>
<p>Eliezer wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, ethical questions like &quot;Would you go back in time and kill Hitler as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a five-year-old?&quot; are very much along the lines of &quot;Why don't you buy the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning lottery ticket, 1,5,31,38,47,3, and feed starving children with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it?  It would just cost a dollar!  What kind of heartless bastard are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you?&quot;  The uncertainty is the *whole point*.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's exactly right, and it would be nice if the discussion could
<br>
move to there.  I first want everyone to admit that indeed they would
<br>
buy such a lottery ticket---and then we can proceed to follow Robert
<br>
and estimate our probabilities.  You didn't appear to get the point of
<br>
the scenario.
<br>
<p>Moreover, estimating probabilities like those, and weighing megadeaths,
<br>
involves very interesting reasoning.  One's mathematics must be guided
<br>
so much by other considerations---such as overall judgment, experience,
<br>
tradition, principle---that I do join those who worry about &quot;hyper-
<br>
rationality&quot;.  I'm far more likely in most scenarios to trust the
<br>
judgment of someone with a good track record who, on the one hand
<br>
is prudent and careful, and on the other hand can indeed make hard
<br>
choices when necessary, in preference to hundreds of subordinates
<br>
with calculators and computer programs modeling overly complex
<br>
situations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the North Korea nuclear weapons situation, yes it is very serious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I just don't see a military solution. For one thing it's too late, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already have the bomb, but even with just conventional weapons a new Korean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war would be the biggest bloodbath since World War 2. It is estimated that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Korea has the ability to fire 10,000 heavy artillery shells into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seoul, a city of 10 million people, every 20 seconds.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's facts like these that I would hope my &quot;most able administrator&quot;
<br>
to have studied long and hard before making his decision.  Or rather, 
<br>
their decision, because I am sure that part of making good decisions
<br>
is taking into account (to a limited degree, of course) what plenty of
<br>
other wise people have to say.
<br>
<p>Lee
