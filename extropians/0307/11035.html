<p><p>Pentagon Reveals More on Classified Bio, Chem Tests
<br>
Robert Gehrke -- AP, 7/01/2003
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON -- Several House members are asking Defense Secretary Donald H.
<br>
Rumsfeld to keep alive the Pentagon's investigation into 50 chemical and
<br>
biological weapons tests in the 1960s that involved 5,842 military
<br>
personnel.
<br>
<p>The Defense Department released the final findings of an investigation into
<br>
Project 112 and Project SHAD, which were conducted from 1962 to 1973 to test
<br>
the combat capabilities of biological and chemical agents and ways to
<br>
protect U.S. troops from such attacks.
<br>
<p>Monday's report raised the number of U.S. troops identified as having been
<br>
present for one or more of the tests to 5,842, many of whom were not
<br>
informed of their participation.
<br>
<p>Some included releases of biological and chemical agents, but troops were
<br>
protected in those cases, said Dr. Michael Kilpatrick, deputy director of
<br>
the Defense Department's Deployment Health Support Directorate.
<br>
<p>Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., and several of his colleagues said it would be
<br>
premature to close the book on the investigations and asked Rumsfeld to
<br>
continue the inquiry.
<br>
<p>&quot;Veterans who may have been exposed during these tests deserve to know all
<br>
the facts,&quot; Thompson said. &quot;The Department of Defense's decision to close
<br>
its investigation may unfairly deny them that right.&quot;
<br>
<p>To date, the Veterans Administration has had 260 claims filed by service
<br>
members who believe their ailments are related to their presence at the test
<br>
sites, although such cases are difficult to prove, said Kilpatrick.
<br>
<p>Project 112 and Project SHAD were developed in 1961 to study the combat uses
<br>
of biological and chemical weapons and methods to protect American troops
<br>
from such attacks. Initially it was believed that only simulated agents were
<br>
used, but last year the Defense Department admitted for the first time that
<br>
some of the tests used real chemical or biological weapons.
<br>
<p>Most of the tests made public Monday used the benign bacteria bacillus
<br>
globigii to simulate how biological weapons agents would spread through the
<br>
hold of a ship.
<br>
<p>One test, called &quot;Blue Tango,&quot; entailed spraying two types of bacteria,
<br>
including E. coli, in a rain forest in Hawaii in 1968 to gauge how the
<br>
bacteria would linger in the vegetation.
<br>
<p>Another, &quot;Folded Arrow,&quot; involved spraying bacillus globigii from a
<br>
submarine over part of Oahu, Hawaii, and over several boats off the coast in
<br>
1968 to gauge how Venezuelan equine encephalitis would be carried by wind.
<br>
<p>&quot;It bespeaks the time, the early '60s, when we were in the Cold War, and we
<br>
were concerned that Russia and perhaps China had chemical and biological
<br>
capabilities that could be used against American troops and against us in
<br>
the homeland,&quot; Kilpatrick said.
<br>
<p>The United States scrapped its biological weapons program in the late 1960s
<br>
and agreed in a 1997 treaty to destroy all its chemical weapons.
<br>
<p>Headquartered at Deseret Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah, tests were
<br>
conducted in Hawaii, Alaska, Maryland, Florida, Utah, Georgia, Panama,
<br>
Canada, Britain and aboard ships in the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
<br>
<p>None of the tests were conducted to gauge the human response to chemical or
<br>
biological weapons, said Kilpatrick. In each test, military personnel were
<br>
protected from the agents by shelter, protective clothing or vaccinations.
<br>
<p>The inquiry began three years ago, after several Navy veterans reported
<br>
health problems they believed might be caused by their involvement in the
<br>
tests. Research into the classified project found more tests and many more
<br>
veterans present, expanding the scope of the investigation.
<br>
<p>Kilpatrick said the VA was seeking to notify the 5,842 veterans who were
<br>
present for the tests.
