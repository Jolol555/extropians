<p><em>&gt;This alternative hypothesis suggests that most literary journeys of

</em><br>
<p>As usual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Real journeys of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-discovery would largely be dark affairs, wherein mounting evidence 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The classic mystical-tradition term for this is indeed the Dark Night of
<br>
the Soul. Of course the base things such people uncover might not be the
<br>
ones you have in mind, but they are said to feel really, really rotten
<br>
about themselves, nigh unto death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And those who do struggle over decades to learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the truth about what people want, and who are willing to tell others, would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;face largely indifferent or hostile audiences.  
</em><br>
<p>As seems to be the case with the gruesome experiences of such mystics. Of
<br>
course what they have to say when they come out the other side filled with
<br>
bliss (which is probably as self-serving and delusory as normalizing
<br>
`journey of self-discovery' narratives) also gets a generally hostile
<br>
reaction, except among devotees.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Young optimists would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolved to ignore the claims of old cynics, since the young optimists of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the past who did not were less attractive as mates and associates.
</em><br>
<p>It might be no accident that those in the western or at least Christian
<br>
tradition who followed this Dark Night path were celibate. I wonder how it
<br>
operated in, say, the equivalent Jewish tradition, where wise religious
<br>
[male] leaders were encouraged to have [father] many children.
