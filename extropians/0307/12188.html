<em>&gt; One serious but unaddressed problem with building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;free state&quot; in today's world is that the existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states will not let you.
</em><br>
<p>Which is the point of the FSP. We move 20k libertarians to one state
<br>
which is most conducive to our goals, infiltrate the political process,
<br>
and make that state even more liberty oriented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a Free State, one would presumeably be free to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever non-aggressive thing one wanted.  Otherwise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what point?  Use or sale of drugs is non-aggressive. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How long would it take for one of the existing drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cartels to move in and set up operations, perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peacefully and very likely spreading a piece of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $billions around to make sure that everyone was happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and probably behaving like the most perfect neighbor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could possibly want?  
</em><br>
<p>WHich cartel are you talking about, the Cali Cartel or the
<br>
Bayer/Smith/Kline cartel???
<br>
<p>When drugs are legal, the profit incentive for criminal enterprise
<br>
disappears. Legitimate producers will produce quality produce under
<br>
pharmaceutical conditions at an affordable price, a price that can be
<br>
taxed to pay for negative externalities of the drug's improper use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How long would it then take for one of the major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist nations - for example, the U.S.A. - to move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in militarily, as it has elsewhere all over the globe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to enforce its own version of public policy - killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drug dealers and anyone who supports them or gets in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way, and supporting gangs of local thugs to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own hands relatively clean?  
</em><br>
<p>Well, for example, if NH were selected as the Free State, we'd have an
<br>
advantage in that we have absolutely no active duty military facilities
<br>
here. Therefore ANY federal active military unit that wants to move
<br>
into or through the state must obtain permission from the governor to
<br>
do so, or risk violating the tenth amendment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, as a non-U.S. citizen, members of this &quot;free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state&quot; will not qualify now, under the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation of &quot;rights&quot; by the U.S. state, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic human rights, in total contradiction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire basis of the U.S. Constitution, yes, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but so what?  The Bush Administration has finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managed to get de facto and de jure recognition of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle that &quot;rights&quot; are something that the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grants you, and, as such, are whatever the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defines.  
</em><br>
<p>Uh, not quite. Firstly, the Free State would refuse to cooperate with
<br>
Patriot Act enforcement, since, for example, here in NH we have an
<br>
unfunded mandates law. No government can order another government
<br>
entity to perform some function without funding that function.
<br>
Therefore, the feds can't ask the state or local governments to enforce
<br>
the Patriot Act without funding said enforcement in its entirety.
<br>
<p>The feds are actually scared of forcing the issue as well, because they
<br>
know that they would lose their case before a structuralist SCOTUS. NH
<br>
regularly tells the feds to take a hike over federal mandates that have
<br>
funding strings attached. We told them to take a hike over seat belts
<br>
and motorcycle helmets, for example. We still get highway funding,
<br>
despite the feds threatening to take it away.
<br>
<p>In fact, NH only gets 71 cents back of every dollar we send to the feds
<br>
in taxes, the lowest of any state. We know we don't need the feds. They
<br>
need us more than we need them, so they never try to force the issue
<br>
because NH is the only state that has a right of revolution and
<br>
secession built into its state constitution. They piss us off enough
<br>
and we are gone. Oh, yeah, and we have the largest gun makers in the US
<br>
here too...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the implicit meaning of denying the application
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of basic rights - as in the Bill of Rights - to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-U.S. citizens.  That's the whole real point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detaining those people in the concentration camp in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Guantanamo.  If being a non-citizen means you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights, then rights must be something artificial -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like incorporation - which is a fiat of the state.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so, then the only questions are those of legality. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clearly if rights is just another name for due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process, then why would we need a &quot;free state&quot;?  And,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what, if anything, would the term mean?  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already perfectly free, almost by definition - free to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do anything legal.
</em><br>
<p>No, you are conflating two separate issues.
<br>
<p>When an individual violates the Geneva Conventions by acting as an
<br>
illegal combatant, ALL of their rights are automatically forfeit
<br>
BECAUSE of their crime of acting as an illegal combatant. They can be
<br>
legally executed summarily without trial. These are not innocent men in
<br>
Gitmo's prison. They are killers who refuse to wear a uniform, who
<br>
attack civilians and torture innocents. They refuse to operate by the
<br>
Geneva Conventions, and since they choose to operate in violation of
<br>
the laws of war, they will be tried outside the civilian court system,
<br>
for their crime is not a civil crime, it is a military one.
<br>
<p>I have several times asked people to read the Geneva Conventions,
<br>
please do not make any more unsupported claims about such things until
<br>
you do so.
