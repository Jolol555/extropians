serious, but I just don't see a military solution. For one thing it's too late,

they already have the bomb, but even with just conventional weapons a new Korean 
<br>
war would be the biggest bloodbath since World War 2. It is estimated that 
<br>
North Korea has the ability to fire 10,000 heavy artillery shells into Seoul, a 
<br>
city of 10 million people, every 20 seconds.
<br>
<p>John,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said, &quot;but I just don't see a military solution.&quot;  May I rephrase 
<br>
that to say, &quot;I just don't see a purely military solution.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know the cycle time on a piece of artillery.  But it can't be 
<br>
much more that once every 30 seconds (expertise on that subject anyone??)  
<br>
That in turn implies that the North Koreans have about 15,000 artillery pieces 
<br>
within 20 to 30 miles of Seoul.  As the DMZ is some distance north of Seoul 
<br>
those guns must be fairly densely packed.  I realize my numbers are not totally 
<br>
accurate but surely we could locate and take out a large percentage of them 
<br>
before they fired.  Then of course if we are under the threat of nuclear attack I 
<br>
suppose we could use tactical nukes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end all of the above gives me a tool to use in opening 
<br>
negotiations.  North Korean can be told we have the means of eliminating you and your 
<br>
weapons without suffering undue hardship ourselves.  Would you like to 
<br>
negotiate your continued survival?  Or alternatively we could determine that we could 
<br>
do nothing and be defeated.
<br>
