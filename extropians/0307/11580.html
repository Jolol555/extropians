<em>&gt; In Miller's view, ethics is primarily about signaling, so whether the

</em><br>
<p>Education signals intelligence, and conspicuous consumption signals
<br>
wealth. What does ethical investment signal? I guess it simultaneously
<br>
signals wealth and belief in an ethical system. For the signal to work,
<br>
the investments do have to be well spent, otherwise it only signals wealth
<br>
and we already have ways to do that.
<br>
<p>I think the main problem with the idea is that it requires people to give
<br>
up their financial privacy. I don't completely understand what is behind
<br>
the demand for financial privacy, but it appears to be quite strong. Part
<br>
of it has to do with bargaining power. If everyone knows exactly how much
<br>
money you have, that makes you much weaker in bargaining situations.
<br>
<p>It's hard to say which will be stronger in the long run, the desire to
<br>
signal belief in an ethical system, or the desire to retain financial
<br>
privacy. But one might expect for example that if financial privacy was to
<br>
erode for other reasons, then ethical investments will become more
<br>
popular. Then again maybe a much cheaper way to signal beliefs will be
<br>
found, for example (as we discussed earlier) standardized mental
<br>
artitectures that can produce a convincing &quot;proof of belief&quot;.
