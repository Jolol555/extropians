Harvey Newstrom reponds to the statement:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have personally never really believed in cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither do a lot of former believers, unfortunately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cryonics has to advance back up to the point where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we once thought it already was.  We now know more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than we did before, and it doesn't look as rosy as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once did.
</em><br>
<p>Harvey, can you expand on this? 
<br>
<p>When do you think cryonics was at it's high point
<br>
in plausibility and why do you think it is lower now?
<br>
<p>If I was to make one overriding criticism of the transhumanism
<br>
movement it would be that there is entirely too much 
<br>
&quot;believing&quot; going on and too little structured critical thinking 
<br>
where assumptions are made explicit and are themselves
<br>
open to constructive criticism. We, this generation, including 
<br>
transhumanist that I'd hoped would know better, seem to be 
<br>
in serious danger of &quot;believing&quot; (as opposed to critical thinking)
<br>
another couple of generations to death. 
<br>
<p>Whenever anybody claims something is going to happen
<br>
in 5 years or 50, or that it is not, I think it would be prudent
<br>
to assume the person is just blowing gas unless they show
<br>
a line of reasoning for their views.   In some respects
<br>
it doesn't matter that the line of reasoning may be flawed,
<br>
if it is out there it can be peer reviewed and improved upon.
<br>
<p>But what is gratuitously asserted is probably best ignored or 
<br>
gratuitously denied.
<br>
<p>Two examples that come to mind of *good* examples
<br>
of this sort of explicit planning and thinking are Robert
<br>
Bradbury's paper on the Protein Based Assembly of Nanoscale
<br>
Parts which gives an overview of a development path towards
<br>
molecular manufacturing that can be critiqued. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Papers/PBAoNP.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Papers/PBAoNP.html</a>
<br>
<p>And Aubrey de Greys paper on &quot;An engineer's approach to
<br>
the development of real anti-aging medicine&quot;. 
<br>
Science's SAGE KE 2003;
<br>
<a href="http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sageke;2003/1/vp1">http://sageke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sageke;2003/1/vp1</a> 
<br>
<p>Imo, the principle virtue of these papers imo is not that they  
<br>
necessarily get everything right, but that they present an overview,
<br>
a practical scheme for moving forward. And because they are 
<br>
laid out as they are, with assumptions fairly explicit, they are 
<br>
themselves subject to constructive criticism.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
