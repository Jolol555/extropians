</em><br>
<p>A good question :-) I recall that many years back I posted similar
<br>
sentiments to the list about expanding the sphere of living beings, and
<br>
was chastized by Eliezer (I think) for seeking to create beings living
<br>
painful lives. My position then was essentially to let evolution sort it
<br>
out; to quote from Zindell (who quotes &quot;Jin Zeniumura&quot; who may or may
<br>
not exist): 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am not interested in things getting better; what I want is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more: more human beings, more dreams, more history, more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness, more suffering, more joy, more disease, more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agony, more rapture, more evolution, more life.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I still hold part of this view, but I think it has matured. I don't
<br>
think it is realistic to imagine everything being uplifted to being
<br>
happy and smart (like in the _Hedonistic Imperative_ by David Pearce
<br>
where we will sometime around the year 3000 finally save the last deep
<br>
ocean invertebrate from aversive experience - I love that passage :-). 
<br>
We will likely do this a lot anyway, and might even pass laws about
<br>
helping creatures endowed with enough nervous systems. But if we are to
<br>
constantly monitor every environment we have created, deliberately or
<br>
not, to save structures from bad experiences and competition, then we
<br>
are not going to be doing much else. My ethical position is that we do
<br>
not have a moral obligation to help everybody and everything, it is up
<br>
to us to make the judgement from case to case, aided by some general 
<br>
principles. Personally I would love to help a lot of beings in creative 
<br>
ways, it is just that I don't think I *have to* help them. 
<br>
<p>In fact, attempting to &quot;save&quot; every creature is very close to the kind 
<br>
of top-down control that stifles surprises and evolution. We want to 
<br>
minimize irreversible information loss and unnecessary pain, but there 
<br>
is a lot of useful information loss and pain too. 
<br>
<p>My taste in gardens is much more towards the British landscape garden 
<br>
than the formal French garden. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I like to hope that 1000 years from now there will be beautiful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gardens in which death (including survival of the fittest) will no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer exist.  But I know that many people alive today would want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;evolution&quot;, including survival of the fittest to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive.  Because of these desires by some will there be places in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe where &quot;nature&quot;, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, places where lions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consume lambs. and so on continue to exist?  Or will rationality win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out and will death of all kinds be completely overcome in all places?
</em><br>
<p>I think death in its general sense as erasure of information is 
<br>
unavoidable within the current laws of physics. As Robin pointed out a 
<br>
future ecology/evolution is likely going to be dominated by rational 
<br>
self interest and economic style interaction, and that looks a lot more 
<br>
humane than current ecology. But the introduction of metazoans 
<br>
or vertebrates did not remove the single-celled organisms or 
<br>
invertebrates from the system, and I think there will be plenty of 
<br>
old-fashioned survival of the fittest going on in the interstices and 
<br>
frontiers of the technosphere. Who notices the plight of spontaneously 
<br>
evolving viruses within the M-brain communications networks, or what 
<br>
creatures evolve from a stray terraforming seed?
