<p>I believe Barbara that you may be getting at the question of
<br>
&quot;What is the price of a moral code?&quot; -- it is somewhat different
<br>
from but related to &quot;What is the price of a legal code?&quot;.
<br>
<p>[Side note -- and &quot;accepting&quot; the legal code in Europe (presumably
<br>
a civilized society) may end up killing two people (the Martinots)
<br>
so the question gets raised as to when and when not a &quot;code&quot; *should*
<br>
be accepted.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee's comments imply that before taking action, he would want to be sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that what he was doing did not violate his moral code. Robert's question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Are we are willing to sacrifice humanity due to personal or moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repugnance?&quot; implies that one should be willing to say &quot;The hell with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.
</em><br>
<p>No, not &quot;The hell with&quot; (since that would lead to chaos and that
<br>
would likely be unextropic).
<br>
<p>My perspective might be best viewed with Spock's observation --
<br>
&quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one&quot;.
<br>
(I would suspect that it is not too different from the
<br>
perspective that may have driven socialist or communist
<br>
societies during the last century.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This action will advance Goal Y, so I'm going to do it, regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the fact that it is incompatible with my moral code.&quot;  (repugnant =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed, contradictory, incompatible
</em><br>
<p>If humanity dies any &quot;moral&quot; code (or legal code) dies with it.
<br>
<p>It was quite interesting this week to watch the PBS viewing of
<br>
the documentary on &quot;The Donner Party&quot;.  It documents quite well
<br>
how &quot;low&quot; humans may need to go to save themselves.
<br>
<p>(For those of you who have not seen this, I strongly recommend
<br>
it as a view of a very unpleasant slice of &quot;reality&quot;.)
<br>
<p>The point (for Barbara) would be that in at least some situations
<br>
humans seem willing to discard the &quot;moral code&quot; (or at least the
<br>
&quot;acceptable&quot; behavior code).  The question from an evolutionary
<br>
standpoint might be do we want to accept or be repulsed by situations
<br>
in which the moral code gets discarded?
<br>
