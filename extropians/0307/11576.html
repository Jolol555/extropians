<p>I can agree with this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Similarly, I'd argue that any &quot;specific&quot; argument you might make would get

</em><br>
<p>I agree that if you have an axiom that says you should always believe the
<br>
truth, you violate it if you ever choose to believe what isn't true.  What
<br>
I deny is that I must accept such an axiom on pain of self-contradiction.
<br>
I need not accept the normative axiom that I must always believe the truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Real journeys of self-discovery would largely be dark affairs, wherein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mounting evidence forced people to believe ignoble things about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves that they would rather not tell others.  And those who do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; struggle over decades to learn the truth about what people want, and who
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; audiences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's easy to see how life will be miserable for anyone who believes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;espouses this extremely cynical view; I take your depiction here to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty gross understatement as to how bad life would really be for someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who took this philosophy truly seriously.  Just imagine how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;association you'd like to have with someone who was in the habit of saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things this: &quot;I've gone through a terrible self-discovery process, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discovered that I don't really like other people, and, what's more, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realized that almost no one else does either.  I'd rather be famous than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;help anybody; I believe most intimate relationships are based on commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accepted lies, and that most people believe in our common mores on account
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of comforting self-deception.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Furthermore, I think you are in no way licensed to conclude that you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correctly captured the notion of &quot;want&quot; that agrees with &quot;the ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense&quot;; indeed, if anyone's more licensed to make the claim to agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;ordinary common sense&quot; here, it would have to be me: you're the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposing that almost everyone is basically wrong (self-deceived) in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way that they use the word &quot;want&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Economists look at what people choose, and try to infer what people believe
<br>
and want from these actions.  I claim this economists' sense of the word is
<br>
also the usual informal sense of the word &quot;want&quot;; it is whatever best
<br>
accounts for their typical choices.  People do choose to be famous over
<br>
helping others, for example, and they do this consistently and with enough
<br>
subtlety and strategic sophistication as to make it hard to believe that
<br>
they do this by accident or due to a misunderstanding.  In ordinary 
<br>
terminology,
<br>
I still claim that your proposed sense of &quot;want&quot; is best described as &quot;what
<br>
I want to believe that I want&quot;.
