<em>&gt;  But I'm unconvinced by the TCS claims about what obligations parents

<p><em>&gt;      The vegetarian who believes that meat eating ought to be

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Only if the kids request it of course, but care should always be taken to
<br>
make sure that kids are exposed to ideas alternative to the parent's views
<br>
(eg: that eating meat might be ok).
<br>
<p>It's an annoying thing to do, as a parent, and often done poorly (eg: I
<br>
personally am pretty bad at giving an unbiased account of religion to my
<br>
kids), so is better farmed out to someone who can be more positive about it
<br>
(I think).
<br>
<p>In tandem with this, it is of course *essential* to teach your kids that
<br>
adults (and kids) will often err or lie, and that they must evaluate
<br>
everything they are told themselves; never just believe anything (including
<br>
this!).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I didn't see any argument that this view is better than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view that the parental payment for the food gives them substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority to influence what their children eat, just as it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were feeding adult friends. Did anyone see an argument that I missed?
</em><br>
<p>I believe that I don't own my kids; I chose to have them, and I bear
<br>
responsibility to support them in their lives until they can make it on
<br>
their own. This is tempered with matters of practicality and my obligation
<br>
to protect them from harm, but as far as possible it's their life, not mine.
<br>
<p><p>On matters of money, although all the financial resources within the family
<br>
are shared (deriving from income earned by the adults), I feel that the kids
<br>
need to have as much say as practical in how resources are spent on matters
<br>
regarding them. 
<br>
<p>So the idea that I'd say &quot;you eat this because it's my food bought with my
<br>
money&quot; is not acceptable. What message would it send to my kids? I don't
<br>
want them to feel that they are a burden and only live at my sufferance. Too
<br>
many of us were brought up that way, and it doesn't turn out to have good
<br>
effects, imo.
