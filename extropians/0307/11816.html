<p>As one of the few who instantly shouted angrily at Robert's even-handed,
<br>
open-minded, Strangelovian discussion of the usefulness of nuclear
<br>
genocide, I probably also need to clarify my stated enthusiasm for Bryan
<br>
Moss's meditation. I called his views adult and worthwhile, despite having
<br>
some reservations. Those with long memories might have wondered at this,
<br>
since Mr Moss has previously presented us with opinions not entirely
<br>
different from Robert's post.  For example, I still recall squirming in
<br>
revulsion at these posts of his from 1999:
<br>
<p>&lt;Yes, I'm seriously advocating slavery.&gt;
<br>
<p>&lt;What's wrong with a little white male Eurocentric cultural
<br>
hegemony?  It's done wonders in the past.&gt;
<br>
<p>&lt; What matters to me is
<br>
mind.  Actually, what matters to me is value, monetary value in the current
<br>
situation, perhaps a more elaborate scheme in the future.  And that's where
<br>
the next suggestion, the one that makes people leave the room, comes in.
<br>
Allow abortion until the child is financial self-supporting.  Obviously I
<br>
wouldn't suggest such a thing in the current social agenda, we live in a
<br>
world that doesn't value (and I mean in the sense of monetary value) human
<br>
life, education, individual welfare, health care, justice, et cetera.  But
<br>
my own political agenda can justify, say, human experimentation on an
<br>
individiual because of his or her inability to support him- or herself and
<br>
can justify it to a greater degree than the current system can justify not
<br>
doing it.  I believe this is the first time I've mentioned my own political,
<br>
ethical, and moral opinions on this list.  I've avoided discussing them in
<br>
the past, I hope you can appreciate why. &gt;
<br>
<p>Black jokes? A provocation? Probably just another extropian ubermensch
<br>
feeling his oats.
