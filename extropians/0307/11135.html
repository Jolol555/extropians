<em>&gt; Consider this passage from the article:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     When most children first arrive they find it difficult to believe that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     no alternative but to submit. In shock, frightened and angry, many simply refuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to obey. This is when they discover the alternative. Guards take them (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     necessary by force) to a small bare room and make them (again by force if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     necessary) lie flat on their face, arms by their sides, on the tiled floor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Watched by a guard, they must remain lying face down, forbidden to speak or move
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a muscle except for 10 minutes every hour, when they may sit up and stretch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     before resuming the position. Modest meals are brought to them, and at night
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     they sleep on the floor of the corridor outside under electric light and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     gaze of a guard. At dawn they resume the position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     This is known officially as being 'in OP' - Observation Placement - and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     casually as 'lying on your face'. Any level student can be sent to OP, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     automatically demotes them to level 1 and zero points. Every 24 hours, students
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     in OP are reviewed by staff, and only sincere and unconditional contrition will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     earn their release. If they are unrepentant? 'Well, they get another 24 hours.'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     One boy told me he'd spent six months in OP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I didn't think this could be true, but it transpired this was not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     exceptional. 'Oh no,' says Kay. 'The record is actually held by a female.' On
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and off, she spent 18 months lying on her face.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, ahem, I have always been of agreeable disposition---there is not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth be told, much of the rebel in me, and I sincerely do admire those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are ready to stand up against the whole world whenever.  But isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *this* pathological?  Doesn't it seem to indicate that there really is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something deeply, deeply, serious wrong with this girl?
</em><br>
<p>No.  It makes her a hero.  I would be proud to meet her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How in the hell could she lay there hour after hour, day after day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without saying, &quot;Just how stupid could it be for me to have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself into this situation?  Exactly what was so important that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to happen?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This is not the same as a great martyr standing up for his God, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political dissident refusing to divulge the names of other dissidents.)
</em><br>
<p>It sounds just exactly the same to me.
<br>
<p>Children are people.  Their parents don't believe it, but it's true.  For 
<br>
her to stand up for her rights is just as heroic, just as meaningful, as 
<br>
Rosa Parks refusing to sit in the back of the bus.  Inconvenient, yes, 
<br>
painful, perhaps even breaking in the end, but heroic.  Remember also that 
<br>
children have learned to perceive much fewer options, and that in fact 
<br>
children in this situation *have* fewer options.  She can't fight to wipe 
<br>
Tranquility off the face of the Earth, at least not yet.  Large scale 
<br>
actions are closed to her.  Her soul is all she has to fight for; it is 
<br>
the only outcome she controls.  As such, it is worth just as much to her 
<br>
as a bus seat to Rosa Parks or the Singularity to me.  Whatever outcomes 
<br>
you can influence, that is your world.
<br>
<p>Consider also her alternatives.  This is a school designed to break 
<br>
children.  Nothing more, nothing less.  She cannot just &quot;go along&quot; with 
<br>
the system.  It is deliberately designed to reach into her soul, find her 
<br>
independence, and break it, to take every inch she gives it, and demand 
<br>
more.  Remember also that these children are not adults and they do not 
<br>
have adult resources to resist; the people trying to destroy their souls 
<br>
are smarter and more experienced and have leisure to think and plan.  No, 
<br>
she was quite wise to resist every step of the way for as long as she 
<br>
possibly could.
<br>
<p>&quot;Tranquility&quot; sounds like a hell on Earth.  Having been to the Holocaust 
<br>
Museum in Washington, I think that calling it a kiddie concentration camp 
<br>
would not be out of line.  Forget Iraq; let's invade here.
<br>
<p>Funny thing.  Adults may be programmed to care for children, but 
<br>
apparently if you're not a political power bloc, no one really cares about 
<br>
what you think.  You're not a game-theoretical agent; you're a piece of 
<br>
valuta to be fought over and disposed of.  &quot;What is it like to be a 
<br>
child?&quot; is as far beyond most adult's reach as asking what it is like to 
<br>
be a bat.  People claim to be working on children's behalf in much the 
<br>
same way that they claim to be working for a better environment or a lower 
<br>
government budget.
<br>
<p>No one thinks much, on this list or elsewhere, of proposing that parents 
<br>
should have 24-hour surveillance capabilities over their children.  Why 
<br>
not?  Children are valuable objects, aren't they?  Why shouldn't we be 
<br>
able to keep watch on them?
<br>
<p>Have you forgotten what a living hell that would have made your life when 
<br>
you were a child?  Are those memories so painful that they have simply 
<br>
been lost?
<br>
<p>But I remember.
<br>
<p>Did you, as part of your teenage efforts to convince yourself that you 
<br>
were an adult, turn your back on all the unfairness because unfairness to 
<br>
children sounds like a childlike thing to complain about?
<br>
<p>But I don't care what things sound like.
<br>
<p>Children are people, and across the world they are being put through hell. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, of course, are many adults.  But it is the children that no one 
<br>
sympathizes with, no one writes about, no one is ever able to take their 
<br>
viewpoint because the memories are too painful and the minds are too alien 
<br>
and they don't dare respect children for fear that others will stop 
<br>
respecting them.  Everyone says they care, and perhaps they do, but no one 
<br>
ever takes the children's side.  The whites who marched for black civil 
<br>
rights and the males who marched for female equality would never dream of 
<br>
joining a march for less homework.  Funny how millions of people can be 
<br>
condemned to hell because it would sound funny instead of heroic to take 
<br>
their side.  Sometimes I wonder whether anyone ever really cares at all, 
<br>
or whether it's all just people showing off how altruistic they are.  No 
<br>
one is willing to care if it looks silly instead of defiant.
