<p><em>&gt; &gt; It might be interesting from a bioethical standpoint to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Truman's justification (using the bomb instead of troops)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Hitler's arguments (for eliminating the Jews) side-by-side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to see where the similarities and dissimilarities are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I think it would be.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. 
<br>
<p>Without getting too forensic (Truman's justification may even 
<br>
be Googlable but Hitler's arguments would be harder to find) 
<br>
one obvious difference is that Truman was aiming at ending a
<br>
war he didn't start and he would have had obligations to US
<br>
citizens that he did not have to the citizens of Japan.
<br>
<p>Truman's motive was different. Had Truman decided not
<br>
to use the bomb he would have been responsible for the
<br>
consequences of that decision also.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I agree.  I don't consider the things I mentioned above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (trying to influence the political process and supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  research) mere hobbies. They are a matter of life and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death to me personally, as I am already 53 years old,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and though I don't suffer from any particular health 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem at the moment, my odds of dying young are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at present quite high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't hesitate to kill someone who was directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatening me or someone I love. I *know* this about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself, because I have been in that situation twice. As 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it turned out, I did not have to kill anyone, but I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully prepared to to do if it had been necessary to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I find this question extremely disturbing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Are we are willing to sacrifice humanity due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personal or moral repugnance?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I am not surprised that most people would find this 
<br>
question disturbing but we must know that some 
<br>
people are not just theoretically but actually placed
<br>
in the position of having to make that call.
<br>
<p>But note &quot;sacrifice humanity&quot; can be taken at least
<br>
two ways. It could mean sacrifice ones own humanity,
<br>
perhaps by attaining some inhuman detachment 
<br>
where the death of a million is merely a statistic, or it
<br>
could mean sacrificing all the human race for a principle.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the principle of defending artificial persons
<br>
or non homo-sapiens that are sentient. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the same way that I avoid dealing with a person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whom I observe cheating someone else (he may tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, &quot;Look, I'll cheat person X, but I'd never cheat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you. You're my friend.&quot; But there's no assurance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I might not  later join the set of non-friends), I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would avoid dealing with a person who is willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toss out his personal code of ethics whenever it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears to him to be practical.
</em><br>
<p>I would agree with this were it not for the question how
<br>
could you be sure you knew (a) their code of ethics and 
<br>
(b) whether they were willing to chuck it out. I can think 
<br>
of scenarios where leaders acting genuinely in accordance
<br>
with what would widely be held to be moral principles 
<br>
would lie or deceive to one or two innocents if it meant
<br>
saving the lives of thousands. You or I might be that one
<br>
or two innocents that the other has to sacrifice in a nasty 
<br>
contingent universe where the decider doesn't get to 
<br>
set up all the conditions of the decision he or she just
<br>
gets to decide. Eg. They have to react in real time
<br>
to the real time ultimatums set up by another or to fail
<br>
to act which is itself something with consequences. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
