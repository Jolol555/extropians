writes: I am taking the position that engineering a situation where you are 
<br>
forced to use nuclear weapons to kill people for the first time in nearly 60 
<br>
years is not a good way to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons; and that 
<br>
after all was the point of the entire endeavor.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### Blame America first, &quot;engineering a situation.&quot;  Those dastardly 
<br>
Americans infiltrated the North Korean government and each night whispered into 
<br>
their dictators ear, &quot;build a nuclear weapon, mass 10,000 heavy artillery 
<br>
weapons within firing range of Seoul.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&lt;And what are you going to do when they call your bluff as they almost
<br>
certainly will?&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### Well, I don't know why you think we would be bluffing.  Massing 
<br>
that much offensive power that close to an international border is a provocation 
<br>
to war that is clearly understood in international politics.  If your 
<br>
statement is true about the offensive power they have have massed then a major threat 
<br>
exists and it has to be disposed of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I remind you that even the CIA admits that Kim Jong-Il enjoys a great deal 
</em><br>
of grass root support in his country, far more than Saddam ever had in his.  
<br>
Yes it's odd that a monster like that could be popular but the fact is he is.&lt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### John you can go to any Golden Glove boxing tournament this coming 
<br>
winter and you will hear exactly the same sort of language back in the 
<br>
dressing rooms and waiting areas.  I have heard the threat many times and frankly it 
<br>
is an idle threat.  His Generals will be loyal as long as he on top and able 
<br>
to deal out rewards &amp; punishment.
