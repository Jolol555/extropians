<p><em>&gt; &gt; But anyone who has the presence of self to have resisted so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hard and so long, why had she not the ability to say and do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what they wanted, yet continue to lead a quite separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inner life?  I would have had no trouble after the age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eleven or so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people can do this, and some people cannot, or refuse to.
</em><br>
<p>Why, that might be The Answer!  She may indeed go through
<br>
life completely unable to control her tongue, whether it's
<br>
in class, in movie theaters, talking to the police, or in
<br>
church.
<br>
<p>But if it's not, then I agree:  she's just *refusing* to.
<br>
I still don't get why.  Unbelievably fierce stubbornness,
<br>
pride, and resolve are parts of it, no doubt.  I wonder
<br>
if Robert Roy MacGregor (&quot;Rob Roy&quot;, the great Scottish
<br>
rebel) would have acted the same way in the same situation.
<br>
Somehow, I can't help feeling that at Tranquility Bay, he'd
<br>
be more sensible, and plot his revenge with more cunning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You appear to be asserting that Multiple Personality Disorder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is preferable to less than two years of physical discomfort.
</em><br>
<p>Joking?  Actors, deceivers, and other people in good control of
<br>
their outward expressions and appearance hardly have MPS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I wonder if she had managed to learn at a tender age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that if you scream long enough and do whatever else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it takes, you *can* win the contest of wills with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be that she did learn that.  Nevertheless, it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good excuse to use force against her.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't saying that this was a justification, I was only
<br>
submitting it as an explanation.  But yes, parents shouldn't
<br>
always surrender to the whims of their children, no matter
<br>
how resolute the children are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I know, intellectually, that I'm capable, but there's something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; very deep in me that is only satisfied if I'm very far from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; goal, and makes actually finishing any project harder than stopping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; just shy of success.  I often &quot;come to&quot; saying &quot;What the hell am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; doing?&quot; when I find myself playing a video game for hours on end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; when I would otherwise have finished a weeks-long project that day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now this part, I intuit, doesn't really add up.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some other factors must be at play.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  I'm interested to know what your opinions are on that.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know for sure, just a feeling.  I take it that you have
<br>
subtracted the usual effects
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. as the most interesting and stimulating part of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a project is done, it is often very distasteful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to finish it off
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. fear (learned unconsciously from previous instances)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of not having anything to do when the project is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally done.  Some people just feel at awful loose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ends with themselves in these situations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We all &quot;come to&quot; and ask ourselves &quot;what the hell we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are doing&quot; from time to time; it's still to be figured
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out if your case is in some way specially different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(it could be)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you saying that you think &quot;being a rebel&quot; is a genetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predisposition,
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  Besides, what else could it be?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; such that their brains are actually different and not susceptible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the ordinary mind-altering behaviors that the rest of us are?
</em><br>
<p>Everyone is susceptible; it's always a question of degree.
<br>
Remember, even that girl after 18 months eventually got out
<br>
of lying on her face.
<br>
<p>Religious martyrs who suffered unbelievably because they 
<br>
would not say &quot;it's one in three&quot; instead of &quot;it's three
<br>
in one&quot; (or some fool thing like that), probably would
<br>
have broken under modern forms of brainwashing, wherein
<br>
the prisoner is starved and beaten for months.
<br>
<p>Off for a three day weekend.
<br>
<p>Later,
<br>
Lee
