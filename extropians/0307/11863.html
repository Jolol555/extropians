<p><em>&gt; &gt; Can you clarify what you imagine this world would be like. To me I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really see that the propagation speed would make any observable difference as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effective force levels would still be the same in any region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a static field in such a &quot;slow gravity&quot; universe nothing would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. But imagine sending out Voyager towards Jupiter. At first it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences the weak tug towards the place where Jupiter was a long time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago, and is accelerated that way. As it approaches the region where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jupiter is, the acceleration will change direction and move towards the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current position, and as Voyager continues beyond it will shift back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards an old position.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree (or more probably, don't understand).  Let's
<br>
just discuss gravity influences moving at speed c.  It would
<br>
seem to me that if a large object (like Jupiter) were moving
<br>
through interstellar space (somewhere between Alpha Centauri
<br>
and Sol, for example), that its gravitational field (i.e.
<br>
space curvature) would extend in front of it just as much as
<br>
it extended behind it.  I say that mostly because from its
<br>
reference frame, there *is* symmetry.
<br>
<p>But perhaps it has to be *really* traveling to generate the
<br>
effect you are discussing.  Very well, assume that this large
<br>
object a couple of light years from Sol is traveling with
<br>
respect to the Big Bang or wrt our galaxy at c/10.  To observers
<br>
moving with the planet, of course its field would be symmetric;
<br>
satellites would orbit it in the predictable fashion.
<br>
<p>But what about to those of us at rest wrt the Big Bang?  This is
<br>
a lot like railroad cars and lightning strikes, perhaps.  Anyway,
<br>
what say you?
<br>
<p>Later, Anders writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I made a matlab program (included at the end for those of you who like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to play with it), and it seems to say the opposite (assuming I coded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, which is anybody's guess :-). The trailing side has a stronger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force compared to the non-moving case. It looks more like a sonic boom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a doppler shift. If the planet is releasing gravity waves, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will of course be doppler shifted. 
</em><br>
<p>I guess that this program will depend a lot more on our relativistic
<br>
assumptions than what we would actually learn from running it.  Or
<br>
did you find it enlightening in some way?
