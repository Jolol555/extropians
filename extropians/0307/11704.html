</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... part way through Stephen Hall's Merchants of Immortality...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw MoI in Border's the other day and it surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me that I had seen no discussion of it on extropians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps it was discussed during the time I was losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lotta my email?  Brett, has Stephen Hall any insight?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I got something out of it. And I agree with Mez's 
<br>
comments.
<br>
<p>Just a few things that come to mind include the extent to 
<br>
which characters like Michael West founder of Geron
<br>
and more recently of ACT have actually been walking the
<br>
extropian talk. He's the closest thing to a full blown 
<br>
&quot;Extropian&quot; entrepreneur I've seen, in terms of the scale of
<br>
his vision, the people and resources he was able to put
<br>
together his political and media savvy, obvious ego and 
<br>
frankly sometimes what seemed to be a reckless even
<br>
manic personality.
<br>
<p>I liked the guy as he was portrayed in the book as a sort of
<br>
exemplar of extropic moving and shaking. But also saw
<br>
in the book warnings of having such egos pushing their
<br>
own personal applecart's and timetables could put the
<br>
general &quot;cause&quot; backwards.
<br>
<p>Other significant insights for me. If either the Clinton-Lewinsky 
<br>
affair had not occurred (undermining Clinton's moral standing)
<br>
or Bush had not &quot;won&quot; the election against Gore then it is very
<br>
likely that the stem cell legislation in the US today could be far
<br>
more liberal than it actually is. The book warns of the 
<br>
irresponsibility of talking of certain cures. But it is undeniable
<br>
that if cures do result later rather than sooner because the 
<br>
machine gets moving later rather than sooner than the cost in
<br>
human lives (real human lives not potential ones) will be 
<br>
enormous. 
<br>
<p>As Mez said this is not really a book about life extension,
<br>
genetics and anti-agings techs. Indeed it covers the period
<br>
up until early 2003 before Clonaid claim to have produced
<br>
a clone and after september 11. It looks at stem cell 
<br>
politics particularly in the US but also harkens back to the 
<br>
right to life politics and suggests a continuum. 
<br>
<p>I would heartily recommend it as a good read to those who
<br>
wonder as I do to what extent such non-direct technical 
<br>
aspects as intellectual property regimes and politics can 
<br>
resist what many folks with a transhuman mindset seem 
<br>
to see as the irresistible march of technologies whose time
<br>
has come. 
<br>
<p>To me the book showed that science is a social enterprise.
<br>
The new dispensations around Intellectual property where
<br>
discovery rather than innovation is driving biotech patents
<br>
probably has slowed down the rates of progress in stem
<br>
cells. Also the book makes clear how politics can close
<br>
down progress in a field substantially.
<br>
<p>Robert Bradbury and I have on occasion wondered to 
<br>
what extent progress being stopped in one country like
<br>
the states simply causes good technologies with strong
<br>
drivers (like people wanting cures and to live better lives)
<br>
to simply work around. To me, how well, the drive to 
<br>
provide what markets want and technology may be
<br>
able to supply on the one hand with the desire to effectively
<br>
close down research that is not well understood in society
<br>
is an open question. But it is a critically important question.
<br>
<p>I'd happily recommend to all extropes interested in how
<br>
IP and politics might impact the role out times of certain
<br>
technologies to take a look at this book.
<br>
<p>One thing I recall is a comment by Pederson an embryologist
<br>
that developmental biologists (embryologists) have been all
<br>
dressed up with not place to go now in terms of being able
<br>
to study human embryology for almost 20 years. Mouse
<br>
embryological development is sufficiently different to human
<br>
embryological development that not being able to do study 
<br>
in humans is really seeming to be a serious problem for
<br>
us developing basic understanding. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the book is in a time period. 6 months
<br>
have passed. Britain can create embryos for research so it
<br>
looks like the basic fundamental knowledge of developmental
<br>
biology will get a chance to be explored anyway. 
<br>
<p>I have no doubt personally that politics in the US has slowed 
<br>
down embryonic stem cell understanding perhaps as much 
<br>
as two years. I feel it would be prudent for extropes and
<br>
transhumanists to be as aware as possible of the social 
<br>
and political ramifications of technologies. It really seems 
<br>
possible (though not definite) to me that mankind may not do
<br>
sufficient research on human subjects to get the benefits for
<br>
curing diseases let along radically extending life for another
<br>
couple of generations. I'd like to call extropes and 
<br>
transhumanists not to the technological battlements but to
<br>
deeper political and media savvy. The technology is going
<br>
to be the *relatively* easy part imo. The real fronts are
<br>
the political and intellectual property fronts. The speed limits
<br>
on change on these two fronts are quite separate (and slower)
<br>
to those on the technological front. 
<br>
<p>Another point made in the book is that there are a number
<br>
of gerontologists and respected scientists like Steve Austad
<br>
and Leonard Hayflick (and around 49 others) who seriously
<br>
doubt that immortality will ever be achieved. 
<br>
<p>I would agree I think with Robert Bradbury here (but Robert
<br>
can speak for himself) that Austad and probably Hayflick are
<br>
worth listening too, AND that aging is a very complex
<br>
series of phenomena. I do not think immortality as opposed to
<br>
life extension of more than say 15 years or more will be 
<br>
achieved by fixing individual genes and addressing individual
<br>
diseases like cancer, Parkinsons, Alzheimer's, stroke, diabetes
<br>
etc, although these are definitely things worth fixing. But and 
<br>
this is the point, a better approach to attacking the anti-aging,
<br>
problem has been suggested by Aubrey de Grey and this better
<br>
(in my view approach) has not been addressed by Hayflick 
<br>
or Austad. 
<br>
<p>Aubrey would take an engineering approach to the whole problem
<br>
rather than a fix the series of things that appear to be broken.
<br>
<p>I'd really love to see Aubrey discuss the ideas in his paper 
<br>
&quot;An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging
<br>
medicine ( <a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/manu16.pdf">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/manu16.pdf</a>)
<br>
with the likes of Hayflick and perhaps especially Steve Austad.
<br>
<p>I think Hall's point backed by the paper by Hayflick which
<br>
Austad supported is solid. The conventional approaches to 
<br>
anti-aging are NOT going to lead to immortality or even 
<br>
serious extension of life-spans soon, but Aubrey's approach
<br>
is more daring. Alas it is probably also a harder sell. 
<br>
<p>From a PR standpoint I am a big fan of Aubrey's Methuselah
<br>
Mouse project to change the popular mindset that aging is
<br>
immutable. But there is a comment in the back of MoI where
<br>
Hall quotes Ali Brivanilou of the Rockefeller &quot;the difference
<br>
between mouse embryological development at the molecular 
<br>
level and human development was &quot;night and day&quot;. &quot;Everything
<br>
that we know about the mouse, (embryologically), we already
<br>
know is not true for humans&quot;. 
<br>
<p>This gets me thinking we are learning a lot, but we are not 
<br>
learning a lot about human embryology particularly quickly
<br>
and without the capacity to do some basic research radical
<br>
life extension may remain a pipedream for the present 
<br>
generation. Sure there is the Chinese. Sure there are possible
<br>
work arounds and political climates can change. But it 
<br>
would be a huge mistake in my opinion to think that anything
<br>
like radical lifespan extensions are going to fall automatically
<br>
into the laps of either this generation or the next one or even
<br>
the one after that. Fact is the future is still very much up for 
<br>
grabs.
<br>
