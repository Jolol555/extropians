I think, we must absolutely win this case to protect the future of European
<br>
cryonicists, and it is not going to be easy.
<br>
The influence of religious fundamentalist thinking are much stronger in the
<br>
US than in Europe. So the most frequent objections to cryonics in the US are
<br>
of the type &quot;it is against God's will&quot;. Now since this is a stupid objection
<br>
that goes clearly against rational thinking, I believe it is going to be
<br>
reasonably easy to defeat or ignore. Also, as more and more people see the
<br>
engineering feasibility of cryonics, they will think much less of God's will
<br>
than of their own survival. I am optimist that cryonics is going to win in
<br>
the US cultural environment.
<br>
In Europe, we care much less about God. I am very happy that in the EU
<br>
constitution under elaboration the word &quot;God&quot; is absent, despite pressures
<br>
from the Vatican, and I hope it will stay out in the final version. So,
<br>
whether something is or is not against &quot;God's will&quot; is much less of an issue
<br>
over here. Unfortunately (for what concerns cryonics) Europeans are more
<br>
sensitive than Americans to social issues. So we will see objections like
<br>
&quot;cryonicists buy potential immortality while the majority cannot afford it&quot;,
<br>
&quot;too many olds (even if they are in young bodies) will reduce the vitality
<br>
and innovation of society&quot;, etc. Contrary to &quot;God's will&quot;, these objections
<br>
DO make rational sense, so it will be much more difficult to counter them. I
<br>
am sure they can be countered, but it is going to take hard thinking and
<br>
harder work.
<br>
Now: what can we do to help winning the Martinot case?

Brett Paatsch a écrit (24.7.2003/23:12) :
&gt; I'd not realised the restrictions on free speach went so
&gt; far in France. By &quot;condemned&quot; do you mean that it is
&gt; actually illegal or just politically incorrect?
Actually illegal.
You know, it's really like in a family. Someone says something, and
the mother says: &quot;Don't say that!&quot;
I am sure it was common in the ancestral tribe, too.
See how Damien recently reacted to a suggestion by Robert :-)
&gt; If I was going to try and resolve a similar legal
&gt; problem with cryonics in Australia I'd look to the
&gt; civil libertarian organisations as natural allies.
I do not know of the existence of such an organization here. I know
some that supposedly care about freedom of speech, or privacy rights,
or consumers rights, or minorities rights, but I don't know any that
generally cares about individual liberties, in a way that might extend
to cryonics.
You have those that defend the liberty to have babies at all costs,
that sort of things. But I don't think their charter will extend to
cryonics.
I will contact a few organizations who are libertarian-oriented, as
they might be the most receptive. I will get them to read the article
by David Nicholas about immortality (that I have translated and
published at &lt;<a href="http://dtext.com/transition/nicholas/nicholas1.html">http://dtext.com/transition/nicholas/nicholas1.html</a>&gt;)
and see if they are interested to do something before the Conseil
d'Etat gives its decision.
Thanks for your input.
Jacques
