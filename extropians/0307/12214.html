-snip-                                                                        
<br>
I have a core belief that \&quot;more complexity\&quot; is better                       
<br>
than \&quot;less complexity\&quot;.  This may be modified by                            
<br>
\&quot;more complexity sooner\&quot; is better than \&quot;less complexity                   
<br>
sooner\&quot;.  That is because the Universe as we know it                         
<br>
and as currently structured might end and if one doesn't                      
<br>
get sufficient complexity to potentially intervene in                         
<br>
that process (sooner) then all bets are off.  (Viewed as                      
<br>
another way I'm concerned that we not only have to create an                  
<br>
extropic reality now, but we have to create an even                           
<br>
more extropic reality in the future, and we potentially                       
<br>
have to warp reality such that increasing extropicness                        
<br>
is feasible and can survive the current reality.                              
<br>
<p>This is driven in large part by Dyson's \&quot;Time without                        
<br>
end\&quot; perspective [1].  Alternate \&quot;realities\&quot; such as                       
<br>
Tipler's hold little attraction for me.  The entire                           
<br>
state of our comprehension of our universe *is* in                            
<br>
a significant state of flux at this time (due to                              
<br>
work in everything from dark energy to dark matter                            
<br>
to string theory) -- so exactly *how* the physics                             
<br>
of reality impacts on maximization of extropic                                
<br>
perspectives I do not now know.  But I *do* think                             
<br>
we should be thinking about it.                                               
<br>
<p><p>Robert - You make an interesting case here for complexity as a valid goal. I
<br>
in general agree, however I think you may be missing something in the
<br>
simplicity (either just for this post or in general) of those words.
<br>
<p>Complexity in and of itself can be good or bad, IMO.
<br>
<p>A Vingean blight is awful complex, for instance. So could be a totalitarian
<br>
state with umptillions of uploads slaving away under strict control.
<br>
<p>How can we tell if we're heading towards more complexity in a beneficial way,
<br>
or in a detrimental way? I'm uncertain, but suspect that individual rights
<br>
(not just of meat-bodies born of the two-backed beast, but of all sophonts)
<br>
might be VERY important to such a situation. Thoughts?
<br>
<p><p>-snip-
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you're born and living, you *count*.
</em><br>
<p>No argument.  But from an extropic perspective I have                         
<br>
to raise the question &quot;How much do you count&quot;?  Can                           
<br>
you climb out of bed on a day to day basis and answer                         
<br>
the question &quot;Yesterday, did I increase or decrease                           
<br>
the entropic trend in the universe?&quot;.                                         
<br>
<p><p>Excellent point. Unfortunately, the devil's in the details. And is the
<br>
entropic trend of the universe the be-all and end-all?
<br>
<p><p>Most members of humanity do not really have the opportunity to                
<br>
ask that question unfortunately. Most members of this list                    
<br>
and certain people in power positions do.                                     
<br>
<p><p>Disagree. The scope may not be of the same degree, but (assuming extropy is
<br>
the best goal available) ANY net extropic growth is better than none.
<br>
<p><p>-snip-                                                                        
<br>
[So the &quot;horror&quot; of nuclear weapons is removed                                
<br>
and one is just dealing mostly with the question of                           
<br>
&quot;Is the long term future of humanity better off with                          
<br>
these people alive or not alive?&quot; -- not too different                        
<br>
from the question that jurors in homicide cases deal                          
<br>
with though I'll admit the numbers are quite different.]                      
<br>
<p><p>Just to be clear, the horror to me is not in the nukes. They're bad, true,
<br>
but they're NOTHING compared to the destruction of that many people on a
<br>
&quot;maybe&quot;. Doesn't matter if you use nukes, chems, a knife, or cars, that many
<br>
deaths is an utter horror.
