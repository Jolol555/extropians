<p>
I just re-read the triad of anti-transhumanist books that came out in
<br>
the last couple years:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
- Leon Kass: Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
- Francis Fukuyama: Our Posthuman Future
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
- Bill McKibben: Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm struck by how different the three books are, and how they're each
<br>
dangerous in their own way:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Kass's book is  the best selling and is the only one of the three
<br>
that's grounded in religious arguments.  In a way, he's 'preaching to
<br>
the choir'.  Any non-religious person reading his book is going to see
<br>
pretty quickly that his arguments are really all based on his
<br>
spiritual beliefs.  Yet there's a large segment of the world that
<br>
agrees with him.  And because Kass is chairman of the PCBE, his words
<br>
carry weight disproportionate to their actual persuasiveness.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
McKibben's book is the most populist and most liberal.  He comes at
<br>
things from an environmental perspective and appeals to a very wide
<br>
audience.  His arguments are very simple and very emotional.  His book
<br>
has a lot of heat and relatively little light.  In particular, he
<br>
distorts scientific reality to make his points.  In that respect, he
<br>
and Kass are very similar.  But McKibben is more of a ranter, more of
<br>
a rabble rouser, with less of the intellectual tone that keeps Kass
<br>
from appealing to the masses.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Fukuyama's book is far and away the best and most cogent of the three.
<br>
Fukuyama, unlike the others, demonstrates that he understands the
<br>
science and technology.  His arguments are secular and relatively
<br>
thoughtful.  Frankly, I think a lot of the issues he brings up are
<br>
legitimate.  The technologies we advocate WILL cause problems.  I
<br>
believe that the cost / benefit calculation comes down clearly on the
<br>
side of pursuing those technologies.  But that doesn't mean we can
<br>
ignore the costs.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In any case, I think these books are worth reading.  Particularly
<br>
Fukuyama's and McKibben's.  I recommend them to any transhumanist.
