<p>
Wired is doing a series on super-powers, based on the August issue of
<br>
the magazine.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pwr_invisible.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pwr_invisible.html</a> is about an
<br>
invisibility cloak, and
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pwr_antigravity.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pwr_antigravity.html</a> discusses
<br>
so-called anti-gravity devices, actually lifters powered by ion wind.
<br>
<p>Tomorrow there should be an article on time travel, and the next day
<br>
one on &quot;8 super powers&quot;.
<br>
<p>The anti-gravity lifters don't amount to much, IMO; I played with
<br>
ion wind powered pinwheels when I was a boy, and these just aim the
<br>
propulsion downwards.  You can't get any significant lifting power
<br>
without using voltages that would be unsafe.
<br>
<p>But the invisibility cloak article is quite interesting.  They mention
<br>
an amusing party trick I haven't seen: putting a webcam on your back and
<br>
holding a laptop screen in front of you, allowing people to see right
<br>
through you.  Seems it would work even better with a tablet PC, make
<br>
a Halloween costume of a guy with a hole through his chest.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately doing &quot;real&quot; invisibility requires producing a view valid
<br>
from all directions, for which they propose using a 10 megapixel per
<br>
square centimeter display, with fish-eye lenses in front of each 180x180
<br>
pixel block, so that each pixel gets aimed in a different direction.
<br>
<p>The only problem is that computing power to generate 4 square meters of
<br>
such imagery amounts to 10 billion GHz, which is rather far away even
<br>
with Moore's Law helping out.  Still, a cruder and smaller version could
<br>
work as a proof of concept.
<br>
<p>The author doesn't consider the possibility of interleaving light sensors
<br>
among the pixels, using the fisheye lenses to focus light coming from
<br>
different directions.  That might reduce the computing power requirements
<br>
and make the logic of what to display much simpler; just mimic what is
<br>
being received at the corresponding position and angle on the other side
<br>
of the cloak.
<br>
<p>One thing I liked is that the article discussed the alien's invisibility
<br>
suit in the movie Predator, which I have always thought was a well
<br>
done effect.  It seemed realistic in that there was a certain amount of
<br>
lag or distortion when the alien moved, which was not only a dramatic
<br>
visual effect (and probably pretty easy to do) but also realistic for
<br>
the way you'd imagine a suit like that would work.
<br>
