[Secret war in Laos...]
<br>
<p><p>I'd like to share a story  - a chapter from my memoir, actually.  It concerns
<br>
the July 26, 1968 sapper attack on the Udorn[1] air base.  I was down the road
<br>
at Ramasun Station at the time.  The following is my statement of facts as I
<br>
know them from my time there and from talking to others who were there at the
<br>
same time.  Admittedly, it includes some speculation on my part, as well as
<br>
documented fact.  If any of you can shed further light on this particular
<br>
incident, I welcome your input.  Many of you have probably seen this before, but
<br>
I'm recycling it for benefit of those who have not and for the sake of a new
<br>
thread.  I call it... 
<br>
[1] Thailand
<br>
<p><p>Sitting Ducks, Sappers, and artificial boundaries…. 
<br>
<p>One hot July evening in '68 some of my fellow airmen were killed and wounded in
<br>
an attack on the Udorn Air Base, just down the road from us.  There was no
<br>
danger of their being completely overrun.  A mere harassment raid&quot;, this was
<br>
officially called, though I'm sure it was just a little more than harassment to
<br>
those wounded and to the families of those who were killed.   In that raid, two
<br>
Thai perimeter guards were killed, and at least two Americans were wounded, one
<br>
of them fatally, by an exploding satchel charge detonated by one of the sappers. 
<br>
<p>It was the Communists' mission to damage or destroy as many aircraft as
<br>
possible, no matter what type they might be, and to generally disrupt operations
<br>
of the air bases.   The TC[2], Pathet Lao and NVA would steal into Thai bases
<br>
under cover of darkness.  Sappers would charge onto the bases with satchel
<br>
charges and grenades, attempting to get near enough to a suitable target before
<br>
detonating the charge.   Sometimes they sacrificed themselves in the process.  I
<br>
remember hearing stories from flight line personnel at other Thai bases, who had
<br>
witnessed cleanup crews going about the grisly task of policing up pieces of
<br>
sapper bodies that had been strewn about the tarmac. 
<br>
[2] Thai Cong
<br>
<p>In the July, 29 raid on Udorn, their target was a C-141 Starlifter.  In this
<br>
case, it was one being used as a medical evacuation plane.  It was unmistakable
<br>
as such with the huge, conspicuous red crosses on its fuselage.  I remember
<br>
having seen it sitting parked on the base for several days before the attack.  I
<br>
took particular note of it, only because it was so unusual to see one there.  It
<br>
was reported to the press that the raiders must have mistaken it for a B-52
<br>
bomber.  That story may have satisfied the press corps, but I found it totally
<br>
absurd, as the two aircraft look nothing alike.  Besides, there were no
<br>
B-52's[3] stationed at Udorn, and how many B-52 bombers would display huge red
<br>
crosses on their sides anyway? Did it just happen to be the biggest, easiest
<br>
target available at the time?  Or did the raiders know exactly what it was and
<br>
specifically target it?  After all, this was a war - one they were fighting to
<br>
win!  For them, there were no &quot;rules of engagement.&quot;  Any target was fair game! 
<br>
[3] B-52s in Thailand were based at U-Tapao Royal Thai Air Force Base in
<br>
southern Thailand
<br>
<p>The raid began at about 10:00 PM. The happenings at the scene that night were
<br>
related to me by a member of the flight line crew there. He had seen the whole
<br>
thing, watching from a ditch where he'd taken cover when the shooting started.
<br>
Unarmed, he had no choice but to hide and hope to survive it. The C-141 had been
<br>
sitting on the taxiway, awaiting arrival of a diplomatic flight from Vientiane,
<br>
which was rumored to be carrying two just recovered American POW's. I don't know
<br>
who they were, or where they had been, but it seems their return was shrouded in
<br>
secrecy. Upon landing at Udorn, they were to be immediately airlifted out to a
<br>
hospital in the Philippines by the Starlifter’s medevac crew. It may have been
<br>
coincidence, but the precise moment the Vientiane flight touched down on the
<br>
runway, the attack commenced. 
<br>
<p>It was a heavy assault, concentrated primarily on the C-141, though I also
<br>
learned from another source that at least one unexploded satchel charge was
<br>
later recovered from the intake on one of the parked F-4 Phantoms. When it
<br>
became apparent they were under attack, the commander of the C-141, Captain
<br>
Robert Shultz, and his flight engineer, Tech Sgt. Paul Yonkie dove for cover -
<br>
too late to escape injury. In a blinding flash that lit up the night, white-hot
<br>
shrapnel from an exploding satchel charge invaded Sgt. Yonkie's chest and
<br>
abdomen, and Captain Shultz's hands and wrists were slashed to the bone by the
<br>
cruel shards of flying metal. 
<br>
<p>I don't know how many were involved in the raid, but the battle went on for
<br>
thirty minutes or more on base before they could be driven back. And the
<br>
fighting continued throughout the night in the surrounding area. It was rumored
<br>
that the arming of the flight line personnel at the air base was initially
<br>
delayed, because the First Sergeant, who had possession of the key to the
<br>
weapons lockers was off base when the attack occurred. Fortunately, several
<br>
minutes into the assault, someone else was finally found to open the lockers and
<br>
distribute the weapons and ammo clips. Under the circumstances, it was fortunate
<br>
we didn't suffer more casualties than we did. When word of the ongoing attack on
<br>
the air base reached us at Ramasun Station, we were put on full alert. To put it
<br>
mildly, it was a somewhat disconcerting sight - two armed MP’s inside the
<br>
operations building, stationed facing the only door, with weapons at the ready,
<br>
locked and loaded. My blood ran cold. 
<br>
<p>To this day, it’s difficult for me to reconcile why the rest of us were not
<br>
immediately issued weapons with an attack under way just a few miles up the
<br>
road. Actually I can, but the conclusions are disturbing. I would have felt at
<br>
least a little better about the situation that night had I and my men been
<br>
allowed to carry our own M-16's and not have to entrust our security entirely to
<br>
a handful of armed guards, however well trained and dedicated they were! True
<br>
enough, we were technicians and linguists, not trained as combat troops. But in
<br>
other wars, even technicians and linguists had been provided means of self
<br>
defense! We each had been trained in the use of the M-16, and we had been
<br>
required to qualify with live ammo, before being shipped overseas. Furthermore,
<br>
we had all been officially assigned a weapon and were required to sign for it
<br>
upon arrival at our duty stations in country. Yet, while I was there at least,
<br>
we were never drilled on what to do, nor told where to retrieve those weapons in
<br>
case of attack. I never touched an M-16 while I was there. We were simply
<br>
informed, &quot;They’re in the armory.&quot; They probably were, but I had serious doubts
<br>
we would be allowed to actually use them when the time came. 
<br>
<p>Today I have to ask myself, &quot;Was it all just for show - something with which
<br>
powers that be could cover their asses in case of a major loss of life due to
<br>
hostile action in Thailand? Was it a measure of deniability for those who were
<br>
calling the shots in this war, and a means of hopefully silencing angry bereaved
<br>
families back home?&quot; As a shift supervisor, I should have at least been made
<br>
aware where the weapons lockers were located and given the means to quickly open
<br>
them if we did indeed come under attack. But I was not. Unarmed as we were, if
<br>
the enemy were to breach our perimeter defenses and overrun the post, we would
<br>
have been &quot;sitting ducks&quot;, much the same as the poor hapless men of LS-85[4] had
<br>
been. Some loss of life is inevitable and expected in war. We all knew and
<br>
accepted that. But some of it is unnecessary and is preventable. I kept thinking
<br>
it was another tragedy waiting to happen. And had it happened, it would have
<br>
been swept under the rug, just as the LS-85 incident had been.
<br>
[4] USAF radar site inside Laos
<br>
<p>I quote from Alan Vick's book &quot;Snakes in the Eagle's Nest&quot; regarding air base
<br>
defenses in Thailand.  &quot;Throughout the war US air bases in Thailand lacked
<br>
sufficient perimeter fencing, lighting, observation towers and defensive
<br>
fighting positions.  These shortfalls made it possible for NVA sappers to
<br>
penetrate base perimeters on at least five occasions.&quot;  Looking back on it now,
<br>
we at Ramasun were ill prepared to deal with an enemy attack, in spite of the
<br>
perimeter fencing, observation towers and lighting we had there. The operations
<br>
compound at Ramasun Station was located very near the perimeter of the post.
<br>
Once inside the wire, it would take the enemy raiders only seconds to cover the
<br>
distance to the ops building.  And if the guards in the towers had used their
<br>
spotlights to illuminate the grounds, they themselves would become sitting
<br>
ducks, easy targets for snipers. 
<br>
<p>If the building was stormed, the two guards at the entrance might take out a lot
<br>
of enemy troops, but in the face of a concerted rush by an enemy suicide unit,
<br>
they almost certainly would have been overwhelmed. Still, we inside the building
<br>
were supposed to remain unarmed at our radio receivers, carry on with the
<br>
mission, and pretend nothing unusual was going on outside - just as the men of
<br>
LS-85 had continued to man their RADAR and communications equipment to the
<br>
last.  Indeed, in the event the post was overrun, in the last moments we would
<br>
likely have been preoccupied, feverishly destroying equipment and classified
<br>
documents and too busy to participate in our own defense! In our Security
<br>
Service training we’d had it drummed into our heads that we were to take care of
<br>
classified information FIRST at any cost! Our personal safety was a last
<br>
concern. 
<br>
<p>This very policy is in sync with another possible, much more sinister reason we
<br>
in the ops compound were not allowed to carry arms. I did not know it at the
<br>
time, but I have since learned some disturbing facts from one in a position to
<br>
know. An MP who had been stationed there at Ramasun, he states there were always
<br>
contingency plans - standing orders among the MP force that no one in the
<br>
compound was to be taken alive if the post were in danger of being overrun by
<br>
the enemy. In a letter to me he writes, &quot;The M.P.s were told no one at Ops was
<br>
to be taken alive if we were overrun. Ops would be the final point of defense.
<br>
We were told before Ops would be overrun the Air Force would be sent in to
<br>
destroy it and the remaining personnel!&quot; It’s a chilling thought to me, if it is
<br>
indeed true. Now I have to wonder, were the armed guards I saw at the door of
<br>
the ops building that night there to dispatch us, rather than to defend us from
<br>
the enemy? In the event things did not go well outside the building, would they
<br>
have turned their weapons on us? My mind recoils from such a prospect. It’s too
<br>
incredible, too distasteful to accept, yet I have to wonder. Certainly, if this
<br>
scenario was true, arming those of us in the operations building would have made
<br>
their task much more difficult, in fact impossible to carry out. 
<br>
<p>As for possible air strikes, I knew then, and it’s a well documented historical
<br>
fact, that Lima Site 85 had been destroyed just months earlier by Napalm strike
<br>
by our own fighter-bomber aircraft out of Udorn. Though the nape was dropped on
<br>
site-85 after the enemy had taken it, it doesn’t require too much of a stretch
<br>
of the imagination to believe they might have preemptively done the same at
<br>
Ramasun Station, if the situation had warranted. After all, there was at least
<br>
some evidence that three of the men at LS-85 had been taken alive and made
<br>
prisoners by the enemy. Like us, they were men who held Top Secret security
<br>
clearances, and were in possession of vital information of great potential value
<br>
to enemy intelligence. And we were fully aware the Communists had ways of making
<br>
even the strongest, most well indoctrinated man talk. Certainly, what had
<br>
happened earlier in the year at LS-85 was a &quot;lesson learned&quot; for those calling
<br>
the shots in this war. They would want to insure they did not make the same
<br>
mistake twice, would they not? They would surely take all steps necessary to see
<br>
to it Ramasun Station would not be occupied, and its personnel captured alive by
<br>
the enemy. 
<br>
<p>The post was but eighteen kilometers from Udorn, mere moments away by air.
<br>
Within minutes after orders were issued, aircraft could be scrambled, and the
<br>
post where we served would no longer exist. All that would remain is smoldering
<br>
rubble. Ramasun Station would be obliterated from the landscape, and we who
<br>
served there would be wiped out with it! Of course, on an intellectual level we
<br>
understood going in, that we were all expendable to protect the security of &quot;the
<br>
mission.&quot; We had been told as much, many times over. It was an integral part of
<br>
our Security Service training and indoctrination. In fact, we had been told that
<br>
our operatives inside Laos had been issued cyanide capsules and ordered to
<br>
commit suicide, if they were in imminent danger of being captured. Still, at the
<br>
time, I don’t think any of us wanted to truly believe in our &quot;heart of hearts&quot;
<br>
that we might actually be purposely sacrificed in order to prevent our live
<br>
capture. That was the stuff of spy novels! After all, we were American boys!
<br>
Uncle Sam had invested literally millions of dollars and years in the training
<br>
of each of us. &quot;Surely, we are of too much value to them alive for them to
<br>
actually do such a thing!&quot; At least we all consoled ourselves with that
<br>
rationalization. It was a source of comfort and means of making the possible
<br>
consequences of what we were involved in less intimidating in our minds. But I
<br>
am a good deal older and wiser now, and I realize we were perhaps naive and
<br>
overly optimistic in allowing ourselves to believe that at the time. But the
<br>
young are by definition, naive and by nature, optimistic. Back then, not one of
<br>
us, I’m sure, truly believed in our hearts we were ever going to die. That sort
<br>
of thing only happens to others. But the undeniable hard reality remains,
<br>
preserving the secrecy of &quot;the mission&quot; was everything! 
<br>
<p>Admittedly, these ramblings represent only speculation on what might or could
<br>
have taken place that night at Ramasun, had the enemy chosen to hit us. In any
<br>
case, we spent a restless, uneasy night waiting there in the windowless radio
<br>
room, anticipating an attack that thankfully never came.  I can only imagine
<br>
what the poor bastards manning the guard towers outside the building were going
<br>
through.   They at least were armed, but I'm sure they would much rather have
<br>
been in a fox hole in the ground than exposed, thirty feet up in those towers! 
<br>
After that incident, I never slept quite as soundly or as comfortably at night
<br>
on post.  &quot;Yes, there damned sure IS a war going on, and it is here!&quot;  Moreover,
<br>
I was left with little confidence that I and my men would be given the means
<br>
with which to defend ourselves if, and when the need arose. I felt closer than
<br>
ever to the men of LS-85. 
<br>
<p>Back at the air base, after the flight line was finally secured, both Yonkie and
<br>
Shultz were stabilized and immediately evacuated to the hospital at Clark Air
<br>
Base in Manila.  There, Captain Shultz would recover from his wounds.  But after
<br>
putting up a valiant struggle to live, Sgt. Yonkie finally succumbed to his
<br>
injuries weeks later.  He was but 34 years old, and I understand he left behind
<br>
a grieving wife and three young daughters.  The morning after the attack, I
<br>
heard that Yonkie and Schultz had been seriously wounded and were air evac'ed
<br>
out, but I didn't learn the particulars of their eventual fates until many years
<br>
later, after I'd returned Stateside.  I didn't know Sgt. Yonkie personally, and
<br>
I don't know if he had ever killed anyone in his life.  I doubt it.  He'd been
<br>
on TDY there (Temporary Duty) from his unit's home base in South Carolina, and
<br>
he was the unit's first casualty of the Vietnam War.  A so called &quot;REMF&quot;, his
<br>
only mission was to help airlift out our wounded, and he surely didn't expect,
<br>
nor deserve to die in such a way.   But then, neither did any of the more than
<br>
58,200 American casualties of that war whose names cover that massive wall in
<br>
Washington DC. 
<br>
<p>The &quot;Domino Theory&quot;, which proposed that other nations of the region would fall
<br>
under Communist control if South Vietnam were to fall, was not just some
<br>
unfounded fear, despite arguments to the contrary.  The Communist sympathizers
<br>
and revisionists of history, who would characterize North Vietnam's part in the
<br>
war as simply a struggle to unite the two halves of their own country, are dead
<br>
wrong!  For North Vietnam was actively promoting and directly aiding the
<br>
Communist insurgents in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, as well as the Viet Cong
<br>
in South Vietnam.  And beyond that, the North Vietnamese were receiving massive
<br>
aid from the Chinese and Soviet Communists, who would have loved nothing better
<br>
than to see their brand of oppressive government spread around the world. 
<br>
<p>These are things to which I can attest from first-hand knowledge.  Aside from
<br>
what I learned personally, listening in on Communist communications, I found
<br>
from reliable intelligence sources, at least one of the raiders killed in that
<br>
fatal July attack on Udorn was a Captain in the North Vietnamese Army.  At least
<br>
one other raider, who had been captured alive, was also NVA.  His live capture
<br>
was a stroke of good luck for our side, and a very unlucky one for him.  For
<br>
days, he was exhaustively interrogated by our agents, before finally being
<br>
handed over to the Thai authorities for further questioning. I don’t know, but
<br>
the talk in the intelligence community was, his would be a fate far worse than
<br>
death. He would pray to die before the Thais were through with him. This had
<br>
been a rare opportunity to glean intelligence from one of the sappers. In the
<br>
raids on Thai bases, aside from the ones who sacrificed themselves as human
<br>
bombs with satchel charges strapped to their bodies, most of the raiders would
<br>
get away.  After a brief firefight, they'd disengage, melt back into the rain
<br>
forest and retreat beyond the borders to find refuge in Laos or Cambodia, where
<br>
our troops and planes were not supposed to follow. 
<br>
<p>The Communist forces which were invading South Vietnam were using the sanctuary
<br>
of Cambodia and Laos in the same way. The no man’s lands of Laos and Cambodia
<br>
were KEY FACTORS in perpetuating the Vietnam War, thereby determining its final
<br>
outcome.  This point cannot be overly emphasized! By their own admission, to the
<br>
North Vietnamese, Laos and Cambodia were absolutely crucial to their success in
<br>
South Vietnam.  The restriction of not being able to send our ground troops into
<br>
those areas in meaningful numbers was the main factor which enabled the North to
<br>
keep the ground war in the South alive, year after bloody year. Because we were
<br>
never allowed to eliminate the Communists’ places of refuge, the war persisted,
<br>
like some throbbing abscessed tooth. The American people gradually grew
<br>
increasingly opposed to an ongoing conflict which seemed to have no end in
<br>
sight. As time went on, more of the mainstream began to add their own voices to
<br>
the voices of the radicals, who for their own reasons, had opposed the war from
<br>
the beginning. That public fatigue with the war is what would eventually allow
<br>
the American people to look the other way, as our political leaders finally
<br>
pulled the rug out from under the South, ending ALL U.S. support for them. It’s
<br>
what would allow America to look the other way and ignore the mass murder that
<br>
would take place in Cambodia under the Pol Pot regime and the many atrocities
<br>
that would be carried out in Laos by the Pathet Lao. 
<br>
<p>I quote here an excerpt from a telegram from the Vientiane embassy to the
<br>
Department of State in Washington, dated March 16, 1968.  It points up a growing
<br>
sense by our Lao allies that America lacked the will to do what was necessary to
<br>
help them protect themselves in the face of determined Communist aggression. 
<br>
<p>&quot;As we enter last few weeks of dry season without visible reduction North
<br>
Vietnamese presence or activities, Lao are bracing themselves for another series
<br>
of enemy attacks. This time there is somewhat less sense of panic than in
<br>
February and a more careful measuring of circumstances.  However, there is also
<br>
an underlying worry and fatalism, which reflects a broad scale of uncertainties.
<br>
Chief among these are apparent inability of friendly forces in South Vietnam to
<br>
reassert initiative, specially in countryside and marks of diminishing support
<br>
for war in United States.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Yes, we did send missions into Laos, trying our best to fight and win a &quot;Secret
<br>
War.&quot;  But they were much less extensive and less effective than they might
<br>
otherwise have been, because of their necessarily clandestine nature.  That
<br>
secrecy was a necessity imposed upon us by a recalcitrant American public and
<br>
the politicians.   For our involvement in an officially &quot;neutral&quot; Laos would
<br>
have been an escalation unacceptable to the anti-war protesters back home!  And
<br>
any news of Americans involved in a shooting war in Thailand certainly would not
<br>
have been well received by them either. But then, those who were protesting in
<br>
the streets at home were not the ones sitting in a jungle, halfway around the
<br>
world, risking life and limb for their country, were they?  Better we should let
<br>
the Communists escape to regroup, re-supply and return in a few days or weeks
<br>
and do it all again! 
<br>
<p>Far from helping us, the protesters back home were virtually cutting our legs
<br>
from under us!  Because of political expediency, we on the ground outside the
<br>
borders of South Vietnam were to be kept unarmed and defenseless. And theater
<br>
wide, we were to be bound by ridiculous &quot;rules of engagement&quot; and expected to
<br>
observe artificial boundaries that our enemies were not obliged to observe. It
<br>
was absolute insanity, a completely, indefensibly asinine way to fight a war -
<br>
one that just would not allow us to win!
