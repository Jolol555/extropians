It's amazing how Samantha tried to twist and rephrase nearly everything
<br>
we were talking about:
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Well, the real dynamic is that he perhaps indeed should yell

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or fortune may be impaired if he doesn't learn to keep his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mouth shut about some things.  This is, of course, the true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unconscious message communicated to those we shout down (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; try to shout down):  Beware---be afraid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think the message to think twice or more before proposing killing 10^8 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings as a utilitarian value is a particularly bad message to send as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a group.  Do you?
</em><br>
<p>The message was not to &quot;think twice&quot;.  The message was a
<br>
personal attack on the morality of the poster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If I say something truly stupid or despicable and a friend of mine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; someone who I respect, reacts with obvious dismay and tells me quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; strongly that what I've just said is dangerous, then I will take note.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes.  Exactly.  Some ideas---alas even here---are just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangerous to speak aloud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dangerous?  Where is the danger of simply being told that one is on an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appalling right bender and should get a grip?   That is all the responses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amounted to after all.   I don't see any terrible danger or intellectual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brutality going on there.
</em><br>
<p>Do you want me to go back and find the damning quotes?  Again,
<br>
you are trying to put an entirely different gloss on.  I would
<br>
never speak of &quot;intellectual brutality&quot;---I was speaking of
<br>
character assassination and personal attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is the floating of the notion that 10^8 murders might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of benefit something to be protected and respected in your mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the horror and repugnance of people on this list is not?   
</em><br>
<p>Because the former was phrased in a constructive manner, and
<br>
held to the ideals of rational debate, and the latter did not.
<br>
<p>Remember, *merely* expressing one's repugnance and horror again,
<br>
tautologically does nothing more than convey one's state of mind.
<br>
What is the purpose of &quot;conveying one's state of mind?&quot;, asks
<br>
Lee rhetorically?  Well (I answer my own question) to shock and
<br>
intimidate others into silence.
<br>
