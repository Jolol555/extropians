Randall, on Saturday 6:35 PM by his watch, apparently
<br>
anticipating my post in detail, wrote

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, but there *is* something very important at stake: who you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; most will eventually come to believe it.  All you have to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is force someone to repeat, every day, that they deserved any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment that you mete out, to turn them into someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really believes that on some level.
</em><br>
<p>This is an important point, but I still cannot credit it.
<br>
I agree that very compliant especially young children
<br>
perhaps might get brainwashed in exactly the way you suggest.
<br>
(I also acknowledge your additional explanation below.)
<br>
<p>But anyone who has the presence of self to have resisted so
<br>
hard and so long, why had she not the ability to say and do
<br>
what they wanted, yet continue to lead a quite separate
<br>
inner life?  I would have had no trouble after the age of
<br>
eleven or so.
<br>
<p>Why is it that they simply cannot act?  I'm not a bad actor,
<br>
(even though many of my associates say that I am, for some
<br>
odd reason).
<br>
<p>Moreover, I do not believe that this girl subscribes to your
<br>
theory on an intellectual level.  I wonder if she had managed
<br>
to learn at a tender age that if you scream long enough and
<br>
do whatever else it takes, you *can* win the contest of wills
<br>
with your parents.  &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child&quot;, as 
<br>
ancient wisdom has it.
<br>
<p>(Listen---I do apologize for the troll-like quality of that
<br>
last remark, but to soften it here on this list would be to
<br>
give in to pressure, to submit to domination, to surrender
<br>
my soul, to lose my identity.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm 30, and I haven't yet been able to completely throw off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the deep belief that I am not deserving of success, ingrained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in me by years of being forced to repeat after my parent that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was not deserving of good grades, etc, since I hadn't done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough work.
</em><br>
<p>Remarkable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know, intellectually, that I'm capable, but there's something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very deep in me that is only satisfied if I'm very far from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal, and makes actually finishing any project harder than stopping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just shy of success.  I often &quot;come to&quot; saying &quot;What the hell am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing?&quot; when I find myself playing a video game for hours on end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I would otherwise have finished a weeks-long project that day.
</em><br>
<p>Now this part, I intuit, doesn't really add up.  I think
<br>
some other factors must be at play.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's a difference between a minor inconvenience from someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fancies themselves in authority, and the horror of having that person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insist that you tell them that you believe that they are right, day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after day, for years.  Eventually, you'll really agree that they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right.  You may think that you could resist that indefinitely, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you might be right, but children are, by nature, far more malleable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than you are.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, some children at any rate.  But those teenagers who are such rebels?
