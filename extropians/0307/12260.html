<br>
<p>Sorry Emlyn, but I have to *most* strongly disagree.  Just because a
<br>
discussion &quot;sucks&quot; does not mean that it may be useful to engage in it.
<br>
<p>The Public Broadcasting System of America offered me a good example
<br>
of this last night in a program &quot;Under Orders, Under Fire&quot; which
<br>
included a Harvard Law Professor (Charles Ogletree) grilling
<br>
everyone from military generals to congressmen to leading journalists [1].
<br>
<p>The premise of the discussion was &quot;A soldier has a duty to serve his
<br>
country, but does that mean following orders no matter what? Should
<br>
a commander counsel - or kill - a deserting soldier?  How does a
<br>
soldier protect himself from guerillas disguised as innocent
<br>
civilians?&quot;
<br>
<p>Though I do not have a transcript for the program -- the conversation
<br>
did deal with issues of &quot;How many people do you lose?&quot; and &quot;How does
<br>
one lose them?&quot;.  (Interestingly the series may be over a decade old,
<br>
long before the current environment evolved.)
<br>
<p>Here are another two definitions of genocide:
<br>
1. &quot;the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political,
<br>
or cultural group&quot; (Merriam-Webster online).
<br>
2. &quot;the systematic killing of a whole people or nation&quot; [Webster's
<br>
New World Dictionary]
<br>
<p>Now, my proposal was not in any way based on race or culture.
<br>
It was based on a clear presentation of the value of current
<br>
vs. future human lives.  If that isn't trying to look at things
<br>
from an extropic perspective then I don't know what is.  If we
<br>
discover a NEO is going to strike the Earth in a month and the
<br>
probable death toll will be half of humanity then decisions
<br>
are going to need to be made.  &quot;*Who* do we save?&quot; and &quot;*How* do
<br>
we save them?&quot;.  And we aren't going to have all this &quot;flak&quot;
<br>
about &quot;genocide&quot;.  If anyone on the list thinks that major
<br>
military organizations, the Center for Disease Control, and
<br>
perhaps other security &amp; health related groups have *not*
<br>
thought about scenarios (that might kill large numbers of
<br>
people) and do not have contingency plans for this then
<br>
they are simply being naive.
<br>
<p>The only thing that I am guilty of might be having the
<br>
audacity to ask the question of &quot;Do the needs of the
<br>
many outweigh the needs of the few?&quot; and ask it in a
<br>
rather controversial way.  But it is *not* an unusual
<br>
question (or one that should be discarded from the ExI
<br>
list) as the PBS special I cite above shows.  If PBS
<br>
can debate issues like this, then I think we should be
<br>
able to do so as well.
