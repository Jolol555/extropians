</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  thinking about it.
</em><br>
<p>For some reason I'm reminded of the movie
<br>
Butch and Sundance where they are about to
<br>
jump down from a very high cliff into a river in
<br>
a desperate attempt to escape their pursuers
<br>
and Sundance I think says to Butch that he is
<br>
worried because he can't swim (= the universe
<br>
is going to end someday) and Sundance laughs
<br>
and says &quot;why are you crazy, the fall&quot; (= the 
<br>
next forty years) &quot;will probably kill you&quot;. ;-) 
<br>
<p>Hell, Robert, we get through that next 100 years
<br>
and we are still having this sort of conversation 
<br>
and we may be glad that the universe isn't going to
<br>
make things too boringly ease for us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; To me, a potential life, a never-would-have-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been-born-otherwise life gets a coefficient of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actuality--and corresponding coefficient of value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; --of zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is where we may part in our opinions. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I view a potential future human life as a &quot;it might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; save my lazy old ass probability&quot;.  [This is well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documented in terms of the productivity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists younger than 30, not yet married, etc.]  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So one should not discount the value of future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human lives to zero (irrespective of the discount 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate one is otherwise using).  [For as I've discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  if one loses humanity totally (leaving aside oneself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as an individual) then the discount rate one selects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  doesn't really friggin  matter -- so one had best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factor in some way to figure out how current vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future human lives may relate to ones long term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival.]
</em><br>
<p>Surely net complexity, total available ingenuinity is not
<br>
*necessarily* going to correlate too closely with 
<br>
such a crude thing as the actual *number* of sentients
<br>
in the distant future. I don't need to believe in AI to 
<br>
feel confident that cybernetics will be feasible and
<br>
that there will be both massive increases in the 
<br>
intelligence of the individual sentients we come in 
<br>
contact with going forward and also that there will be 
<br>
a far greater community of mind, bringing with it 
<br>
both a speed of conveying ideas and a greater sense
<br>
of community to the majority of sentients in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Once you're born and living, you *count*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No argument.  But from an extropic perspective I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to raise the question &quot;How much do you count&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>This is a very good and very contemporay question. 
<br>
This genuinely good question was raised in Australia
<br>
and elsewhere in recent times around the nature of
<br>
stem cell legislation where the real moral question
<br>
that had to be considered once all the sound and fury
<br>
was removed was, given that an embryo, (or perhaps
<br>
in future any living cell) has the *potential* to be 
<br>
transformed into a person how do we today, tommorow
<br>
and next year, in real time, with real medical problems 
<br>
and the need to make hard triaging calls on where we
<br>
as communities and societies spend our resources
<br>
determine the relative moral weigh of potential persons
<br>
in various stages of actualisation against actual persons?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you climb out of bed on a day to day basis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer the question &quot;Yesterday, did I increase or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decrease the entropic trend in the universe?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most members of humanity do not really have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity to ask that question unfortunately. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of this list and certain people in power 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I *still* have not seen a clear and concise argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;the needs of the many living&quot; outweigh &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs of the many more future living&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>What part of your quandry is not addressed if we state
<br>
things in terms of the need of those persons who actually
<br>
exist outweigh the needs of the many more potential 
<br>
persons (who by definition don't yet exist as full persons)?
<br>
<p>The reason I asks is because if the argument or question
<br>
is couched in terms of embryos or cells or forms of life 
<br>
then we can perhaps come to grips with it with to varying
<br>
degrees of precision both now and after review again latter
<br>
as the practical necessity to make decisions requires. 
<br>
<p>But if you were for instance to hold the view that the
<br>
death of a man must be weighted as a tragedy not just
<br>
because he is himself dead but each sperm in his testes
<br>
were somehow special too then we really are going 
<br>
somewhere strange and my question would be why
<br>
&nbsp;bother going there? How is it useful to pursue such a
<br>
line?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I've seen arguments that those living have a right of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;being&quot;. Sorry, Nature doesn't care about said &quot;right&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- be it an earthquake, a volcano or an asteroid they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not discriminate and they are ruthless. So the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question becomes *what* one is doing to reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  those risks (for either humanity or oneself) or whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has adopted a perspective of &quot;Live for now -- for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it may all be over soon&quot; (which of course isn't a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  extropic perspective).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Woulda-coulda-shoulda been alive is nothing, zero, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a fantasy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in my book -- those people may save my ass.
</em><br>
<p>I can well understand how having an increased number
<br>
of highly intelligent knowledge workers working in 
<br>
concert on life extension etc could indeed save your
<br>
arse in the near term (and mine) and I can well 
<br>
understand how such a perception can motivate and 
<br>
focus one but I don't really follow the additional point, 
<br>
if indeed you are making it, that numbers of lives will
<br>
matter in the timeframe that is relevant to altering say
<br>
the big crunch or dilution of the universe. 
<br>
<p>I think it would be useful to the discussion to identify 
<br>
how it is that you think larger numbers of sentients 
<br>
as opposed to fewer numbers of sentients might 
<br>
save your ass. (If your right there are few other
<br>
contemporary asses I'm quite fond of as well including
<br>
one that I am very attached too).
<br>
<p>I *certainly* agree with this in the short term. But 
<br>
beyond that 100 year horizon I don't think increasing
<br>
numbers will matter as each individual repositary of 
<br>
sentience can still increase its complexity and therefore
<br>
net complexity can still increase.
<br>
<p>I reckon the imperative to triage and do the tough moral 
<br>
analysis is greatest in the *near* term. We are going to
<br>
have to come to terms with the fact that we *cannot* 
<br>
save all of us and not all of us (humanity) are even 
<br>
currently living with the lights on.  Further some sections
<br>
of humanity will go out of their way to oppose what is 
<br>
an extropic path because they are afraid or because 
<br>
they are mistaken.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm trying to force one into the position of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices between &quot;morality&quot; or &quot;humanity&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that it may be fundamental to extropic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspectives.
</em><br>
<p>Me too.
