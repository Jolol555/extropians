<em>&gt; Humans have rescued the life on this planet from

</em><br>
<p>...I still think spike is enjoying a dry technoweenie
<br>
style amusement with the above ongoing theme of
<br>
humanity showing up just in the nick of time and
<br>
saving the planet from carbon exhaustion...  Jeff
<br>
<p><p>Certainly I am enjoying this theme, as is my
<br>
custom.  My outlook on life is a kind of converse 
<br>
of a common 1960s paradigm, adapted by making it into
<br>
&quot;If it doesn't feel good, don't do it.&quot;
<br>
<p>The more I ponder the theme of a one-way carbon-sink
<br>
the stronger the notion becomes, for it holds even if 
<br>
Thomas Gold's notions of hydrocarbon formation
<br>
are correct.  He is not actually arguing that pure
<br>
carbon is formed during the process of planet formation,
<br>
but rather the mechanics of hydrocarbon formation
<br>
(microbes vs dinosaurs).
<br>
<p>In either case, the carbon still eventually ends up in 
<br>
a form that is unavailable to the kinds of lifeforms 
<br>
that evolved on this planet, until humans began 
<br>
liberating it.  I do not believe that Dr. Gold would
<br>
argue that any known nontechnological lifeform could 
<br>
break down anthracite coal, never mind diamond.
<br>
<p>On this planet we have volcanism and plate tectonics,
<br>
which recycle carbon to some extent, however it is
<br>
easy to imagine life forming on a planet which does
<br>
not have either.  This would explain how it is that
<br>
life on this planet managed to survive for 85% of its
<br>
history in the form of blue-green algal mats without
<br>
actually using up all the raw materials.  
<br>
<p>Still, the carbon cycle is imperfect, and as time went 
<br>
on, we can imagine it becoming ever less efficient in
<br>
recycing the carbon, as the crust becomes thicker and
<br>
the mantle ever less accessible.  On a planet without
<br>
volcanism and plate tectonics, coal would still form
<br>
however, so that one could theorize that life on those
<br>
planets would not have the luxury of being allowed
<br>
a leisurely 4 billion years to figure out how to go
<br>
multicellular, evolve intelligence, develop technology.
<br>
Perhaps most planets have only one billion years of
<br>
procariotic lifespan available until carbon-starvation,
<br>
which is in general not enough time to make the
<br>
three critical steps given above.
<br>
<p>It is not surprising that Robert should suggest 
<br>
the evolution of non-carbonbased lifeforms, for
<br>
he has theorized one: the Bradburian silicon-based 
<br>
M-Brain.  Perhaps we can see this as the fourth
<br>
critical step in evolution, that absolutely requires 
<br>
going thru each of the first three:  1) evolution of
<br>
life, 2) development of multicellular lifeforms,
<br>
3) the development of technology-capable lifeforms,
<br>
4) construction of MBrains.
<br>
<p>Claim: there is no possible path to step 4 without
<br>
going thru and surviving each of the previous 3.
<br>
Claim: the previous 3 steps absolutely require 
<br>
carbon based life.
