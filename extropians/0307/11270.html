The Dallas Morning News, Europe Bureau, By Gregory Katz, 7 July 2003
<br>
<p>PARIS -- Does this diet seem healthful?  Steak and other red meat 
<br>
topped by heavy sauces, large helpings of salted French fries and 
<br>
bread slathered with butter, plenty of wine with meals and a pack of 
<br>
cigarettes a day.  Breakfast, of course, is chocolate pastry.
<br>
<p>It may sound like a recipe for heart disease, lung cancer and an 
<br>
early death.  But the French live on average at least one year longer 
<br>
than Americans.
<br>
<p>While many Americans are using skimmed milk in their cappuccino and 
<br>
scouting out tasteless, low-fat muffins, the unperturbed French are 
<br>
still eating rich, buttery croissants and drinking their morning 
<br>
coffee with warm whole milk.
<br>
<p>How can they eat all this saturated fat and live so long?  What is 
<br>
the reason for this anomaly, which doctors have dubbed the &quot;French 
<br>
paradox&quot;?  Are there lessons that extend beyond the boundaries of 
<br>
France, where eating and drinking well are a national passion?
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the wine,&quot; said Jacky Larsonneur, who with his wife, France, 
<br>
runs the small restaurant Je Thé Me in the Vaugirard neighborhood of 
<br>
Paris.  &quot;The red wine is very important.  It has calcium, magnesium, 
<br>
potassium, all the mineral elements.  You should have two or three 
<br>
glasses of wine a day, with your meals.&quot;
<br>
<p>It has become French custom to credit the health-giving properties of 
<br>
red wine for the low rates of heart disease that are a contributor to 
<br>
their longevity.  It is a national credo that benefits the country's 
<br>
many wine-producing regions and furthers the image of France as a 
<br>
haven for enjoying the good life.
<br>
<p>The view that red wine helps prevent heart disease has been supported 
<br>
by numerous studies and endorsed by several leading cardiologists 
<br>
throughout the world.  Nonetheless, many doctors are reluctant to 
<br>
advise patients to drink wine for fear of contributing to alcoholism.
<br>
<p>The French believe the benefits of their diet extend beyond the wine 
<br>
that is served with most meals.  Many also believe that French food 
<br>
is much less likely to be treated with additives and preservatives 
<br>
than food found in American supermarkets.  French consumers can 
<br>
usually consume meat, produce and fruit grown locally.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have a lot of small markets here, and we can buy things very 
<br>
carefully to make sure the meat doesn't have hormones added, and we 
<br>
know how the meat has been raised and how the produce has been 
<br>
grown,&quot; said Mrs. Larsonneur, interrupting her husband's impassioned 
<br>
praise of red wine.  &quot;Here farming is done on a small scale, and the 
<br>
food is much better.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Larsonneurs, and many French people, agree that Americans simply 
<br>
eat too much junk.
<br>
<p>&quot;We went to America and we could not eat like that,&quot; Mr. Larsonneur 
<br>
said.  &quot;Americans eat things that are too sweet and too heavy and too 
<br>
fat and soft drinks filled with additives.  It's disgusting for a 
<br>
French person to watch.&quot;
<br>
<p>One indication of the commitment to fresh food can be found in the 
<br>
fact that the Larsonneurs do not have a freezer at their 
<br>
hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Freezing causes food to lose quality 
<br>
and nutritional value, they believe.
<br>
<p>Mrs. Larsonneur said the French also benefit because leisurely family 
<br>
meals are still a tradition, even during the busy workweek.  &quot;We take 
<br>
our time to prepare a very nice table, and we eat calmly and slowly,&quot; 
<br>
she said.  &quot;In the U.S. they eat on the street; they eat very fast. 
<br>
I would rather not eat at all if I can't sit down.  We may take an 
<br>
hour and a half to eat.  It's important for your equilibrium.&quot;
<br>
<p>This attitude carries over to the business lunch.  It is common in 
<br>
central Paris to see men and women in suits lingering over their last 
<br>
coffee and cigarettes after finishing a three-course meal.  The 
<br>
classic lunch is still steak and fries, often served with a fried egg 
<br>
on top of the beef -- cholesterol be damned.
<br>
<p>And don't expect them to skip dessert.  Profiteroles, chocolate mouse 
<br>
and scoops of rich Berthillon ice cream are popular.  Another 
<br>
cultural difference can be found in the attitude toward wine.  While 
<br>
American parents typically try to keep children from all alcohol, 
<br>
French parents usually start giving their children sips of wine when 
<br>
they are 5 or 6 years old.
<br>
<p>Dr. Serge Renaud, a prominent cardiologist whose research has helped 
<br>
establish a medical basis for the &quot;French paradox&quot;, said there is now 
<br>
conclusive statistical evidence showing that wine can help prevent 
<br>
heart disease and reduce cancer rates.
<br>
<p>&quot;The polyphenols in wine have a very important antioxidant effect 
<br>
throughout the body,&quot; he said.  &quot;But to be beneficial you have to 
<br>
drink moderately -- for a man, two or three sizable glasses a day, 
<br>
for a woman, one or two.  And to be beneficial, you should drink it 
<br>
with meals and not become intoxicated.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some researchers believe the polyphenol molecules inhibit a peptide 
<br>
called endothelin-1, which is known to contribute to heart disease by 
<br>
causing blood vessels to narrow.  Others, such as the late Dr. 
<br>
Christiaan Barnard, a pioneer heart transplant surgeon, maintain that 
<br>
the benefits of red wine cannot be easily understood and should 
<br>
simply be enjoyed.
<br>
<p>Skeptics say it is not surprising that Dr. Renaud of Bordeaux, famed 
<br>
the world over for its quality wines, believes that wine has health 
<br>
benefits.  But Dr. Renaud cites many studies reported in prestigious 
<br>
medical journals in the last 11 years to back his claim.
<br>
<p>And he freely concedes that many French people drink far too much 
<br>
wine, not only losing the beneficial effect but also descending into 
<br>
life-threatening alcoholism.  He said French life expectancy would be 
<br>
even higher if many men did not die relatively early because of 
<br>
alcohol abuse.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you drink five or six glasses a day, you lose the benefit to your 
<br>
heart and your health; and if you drink more than that, it has a 
<br>
negative effect,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Dr. Renaud said the health benefits of wine can be amplified by 
<br>
modifying eating habits to conform to the so-called Mediterranean 
<br>
diet that emphasizes fish, whole grains, nuts, olive oil, fruits and 
<br>
vegetables along with moderate wine consumption.
<br>
<p>A survey of more than 22,000 Greeks released in late June found that 
<br>
this diet led to a 33 percent reduction in the death rate from heart 
<br>
disease and a 24 percent lowering of cancer rates.  Doctors said the 
<br>
findings emphasized the importance of diet for overall health, not 
<br>
just the prevention of heart disease.
<br>
<p>None of this is news to devotees of French wine.
<br>
<p>Philippe Ansot gave up a career as a waiter to open a small wine shop 
<br>
in the Belleville neighborhood of Paris.  He credits French longevity 
<br>
not just to the wine, but also to the overall quality of food that 
<br>
the French consume.  He said they identify with their food and wine 
<br>
in a way that other cultures do not.
<br>
<p>&quot;These local foods and products bring a lot of pleasure,&quot; he said. 
<br>
&quot;The whole idea of taking pride in local cuisine and getting pleasure 
<br>
from locally raised food in combination with a local wine creates a 
<br>
kind of joy that maybe Americans don't have.  It creates a universe 
<br>
in which you really live well.&quot;
<br>
<p>But there are indications that this healthy French lifestyle is 
<br>
starting to fade.  A new study of 25,700 people released in June 
<br>
indicated that more and more French are overweight, in part because a 
<br>
sedentary lifestyle is taking hold.  The study found that more 
<br>
children eat fast food and spend their free time watching television 
<br>
or playing computer games.
<br>
<p>Doctors analyzing the results predicted that rates of heart disease, 
<br>
diabetes and other serious illnesses probably would rise in the 
<br>
coming decades as a result.  In effect, this would mean the end of 
<br>
the French paradox.
<br>
<p>It's a change that can be seen on the streets of Paris, said Mrs. 
<br>
Larsonneur, the restaurant ownder who believes in serving the 
<br>
freshest of foods.  She has started to notice women carrying home 
<br>
ready-made dinners and -- horrors! -- frozen food from the 
<br>
supermarket.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are trying to keep the traditions, but things are changing,&quot; she said.
