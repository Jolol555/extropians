<em>&gt; How about a poll...
</em><br>
<p>I should have answered this myself, so here goes...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who on the list personally knows someone affected by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism. Personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquaintances as maximum distance, no friends of friends please.
</em><br>
No, except if Alex Blainey counts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More subjective: would you rate yourself now (hopefully based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on some kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of quasi-empirical guestimate, at least) as more or less safe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10 years ago? 20 years ago? 
</em><br>
<p>I haven't noticed anyone that I personally know being actually threatened
<br>
more than in the past (ie: no one has actually copped it). So I couldn't
<br>
honestly say from that basis that I'm less safe than in the past.
<br>
<p>In the eighties, I was far more scared of MAD. In the 90s, I felt safer (and
<br>
more optimistic). Now, I'm less secure, because the world political
<br>
situation seems to have gone crazy. Too many sabres rattling for my liking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What are the major threats to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence/lifestyle? How about 10 years into the future? 
</em><br>
<p>Car crash, cancer, heart disease. Although I've seen Robert's stats now (url
<br>
in another post), and suspect that I'm more worried about car crashes than I
<br>
should be.
<br>
<p>If geopolitical events continue on their current course, ten years from now
<br>
could see us in a wildly unstable situation, as king kong swats smashes
<br>
buildings and swats in frustrations at the little planes buzzing around his
<br>
head. Hopefully some sense will prevail on all fronts, and things might calm
<br>
down. Otherwise, the world situation becomes a growing threat.
<br>
<p>Further in the future, a lot depends on the course of world politics. A
<br>
world that becomes substantially less free seems inevitably to lead to a
<br>
crippled fight against aging, which means we are all dead.
