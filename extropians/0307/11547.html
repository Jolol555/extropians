<em>&gt; The best solution I think I've seen for this &quot;thus far&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mangle the address with an image within it.  For example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the &quot;@&quot; a gif generally fools the address harvesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bots but still allows humans to get the message.
</em><br>
<p>There's another solution with embedded javascript putting the email address
<br>
text together at the client side, which apparently hides it well from bots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This does however tend to make nonfunctional one of the more useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features of the HTML protocol (i.e. the &quot;mailto:&quot; capability).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if that is the price we have to pay to defeat the spammers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until better protocols and laws can be developed -- so be it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (An interesting idea would be to promote everyone &quot;creatively&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifying their email addresses such that intelligent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can decode them but bots cannot.  As Spike points out this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will drive the evolution of bot intelligence -- but there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of us than there are of them (and our aggregate CPU
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity still significantly exceeds theirs).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I still think that the best way to stop spammers is to encourage active
<br>
communication with them. Pick one spam per day, and actually
<br>
reply/call/whatever, just to tell them that you are not interested in their
<br>
product. Politely. If most people did this, the amount of incoming
<br>
rejections would entirely flood their communications channels, and obfuscate
<br>
the very low percentage of positive responses that they get. ie: They'd be
<br>
crippled by inverse spam. Cost of business goes way up, and becomes
<br>
pointless.
<br>
<p>For those spams that advertise websites, all I can think is that DDOS
<br>
attacks are highly underrated...

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we will need to get to the point of randomly altering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our email addresses and communicating them to &quot;trusted&quot; users
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (akin in some respects to the way that spread spectrum communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works) while &quot;novel&quot; communications will have to hurdle multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verification protocols to get our attention.
