<p>[Mark, please read all the way to the end of this -- you offer

an observation there that I did not have the perspective of

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert, I don't get the feeling you take serious the &quot;just one problem&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we might think of as  &quot;the iron laws of galactic history&quot; problem.
</em><br>
<p>I understand your point.  I'll try to provide some justification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It looks like we will soon have the technology to send out a genesis probe (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; von Neumann machine on the end of a rocket).
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  But it raises the question:
<br>
&nbsp;(a) Why in the blazes would one do that?  Given that it may be sowing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the seeds for the destruction of oneself or ones civilization).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[For the sowing of a genesis probe to make sense you also have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to argue that the civilization is monumentally stupid or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-destructive (in the long run)].
<br>
&nbsp;(b) One has to argue that SR probes will not have been eliminated by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more advanced civilizations (as a really bad idea).
<br>
<p>So one is only left with the possibility that a very &quot;early&quot; advanced
<br>
technological civilization sent out SR-probes (which will ultimately
<br>
come back to haunt it) and they managed to get a sufficient foothold
<br>
to allow their survival before more sensible minds came to dominate
<br>
the environment.
<br>
<p>This scenario *may* have happened in some galaxies -- which is why
<br>
I view the exploration of what is &quot;out there&quot; with some interest.
<br>
(I'll note this week we seem to have both observations that stars
<br>
with higher metal content are more likely to have jupiter class planets
<br>
as well as the fact that there seem to be galaxies that only consist
<br>
of hydrogen gas (given our limited observational capabilities)...
<br>
There are a *lot* of possibilities that we have not considered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we don't send out such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probe it looks for all the world that this must be a political decision.
</em><br>
<p>No -- absolutely not.  Not sending out a SR probe is ultimately
<br>
a &quot;survival decision&quot;.  One does *not* want ones foolish youthful
<br>
decisions (&quot;oh -- lets just see what is out there&quot;) to come back
<br>
to haunt you in old age as in (&quot;oh dad, I notice that my sun is running
<br>
out of hydrogen so why don't I simply 'borrow' some from your sun&quot;).
<br>
<p>Duh...  I think even spike would be willing to agree that this
<br>
isn't &quot;rocket science&quot;.
<br>
<p>Doesn't mean that a few civilizations might not get it wrong from
<br>
time to time -- but if there is a &quot;Galactic Club&quot; established it
<br>
seems likely that it will quickly crack down hard on such foolish
<br>
civiliztions.
<br>
<p>Here is an interesting question (for an advanced civilization) --
<br>
If there *were* a &quot;Galactic Club&quot; (something that you cannot in
<br>
any way be certain of due to speed-of-light delays in ones
<br>
knowledge of the state of the galaxy) -- how would one view
<br>
a civilization that would behave so stupidly as to send out
<br>
SR probes in a Universe that one suspects (given current
<br>
observations) has finite resources?  (So one is going to have
<br>
to eliminate the self-replicators *sooner or later*.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are there galactic iron laws that prohibit us from doing this?
</em><br>
<p>No -- but I think there may be logical conclusions that any
<br>
rational species may reach and therefore they end up becoming
<br>
the &quot;law of the land&quot;.
<br>
<p>So you have to argue that there are &quot;advanced technological
<br>
civilizations&quot; that are quite misinformed (i.e. they have
<br>
not bothered to scan the galaxy for signs of intelligent
<br>
activity -- [note I said &quot;signs&quot; and not &quot;communication&quot;])
<br>
or else they are not rational.
<br>
<p>It might be an interesting discussion -- &quot;what would be the
<br>
longevity of a non-rational civilization?&quot;  (We can use humanity
<br>
as a marker perhaps -- we may be pushing towards 10,000 years with
<br>
semi-rationality.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [snip] then one of them would have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the imprudent thing long ago and there should be genesis probes here right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, one can be &quot;imprudent&quot;.  Going in that direction raises any
<br>
number of questions.  I'll point out only two:
<br>
(a) how can one guarantee there is not an alien presence within this
<br>
solar system specifically tasked with keeping us from behaving
<br>
imprudently?  It doesn't even have to be particularly intelligent
<br>
(how intelligent does it have to be to prevent SR probes from
<br>
leaving the solar system...);
<br>
(b) Have you seriously considered the intelligence scales?  An
<br>
MBrain has around 10^42 OPS.  A probe has what 10^13?  (Somewhat
<br>
less than a human even if you are using moderately advanced tech).
<br>
Can you seriously propose that the &quot;imprudent&quot; behavior is going
<br>
to survive in galaxy where &quot;prudent&quot; behavior has a selective
<br>
advantage?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily imagine a group of Nietzscheans saying that they think launching a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genesis probe is the highest manifestation of their will to power,
</em><br>
<p>Good example *but* I think you need to qualify it as being a bunch
<br>
of extremely unintelligent Nietzscheans who really do not care about
<br>
their own survival.  And they only get lucky if they &quot;happen&quot; to
<br>
exert their &quot;power&quot; at the precise point in galactic evolution when
<br>
it might be successful.  And given the speed of light delays there
<br>
is probably no way of knowing that.  So they are playing a very high
<br>
stakes game.  And in most high stakes games one loses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are a reasonable number of advanced civilizations then there must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iron laws: political laws stopping genesis probes--a galactic UN of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorts--or some as yet unknown laws of the universe that prevent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launching of a genesis probe.
</em><br>
<p>Ah-ha -- so we come to some meeting of the minds -- perhaps.  There
<br>
may not be &quot;political&quot; rules preventing probes but there may be both
<br>
some logical rules (that civilizations impose upon themselves) as
<br>
well as interdiction efforts (imposed by any galactic clubs).  Where
<br>
*we* (humanity) reside in this development process needs quite a bit
<br>
more information before we can make any well qualified judgements
<br>
I would feel.
