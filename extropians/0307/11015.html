<p>
We can combine Lee's proposal of a machine which (potentially) destroys
<br>
and re-creates your consciousness 100 times a second with the idea of
<br>
evolution evolving consciousness to produce a horrific concept: a world
<br>
which has evolved consciousness which works like Lee's machine!
<br>
<p>In this bizarre world (call it World X), animals and intelligent beings
<br>
are conscious as they are in our world, but due to a quirk of their brain
<br>
chemistry, their consciousness is destroyed and re-created 100 times a
<br>
second.  Yet this has no impact on their behavior, because it happens so
<br>
quickly.
<br>
<p>Without their knowledge, slaughter and death is occuring on a horrendous
<br>
scale, with every conscious being on World X dying 100 times a second.
<br>
<p>The terrible part is, since this does not affect their behavior, there
<br>
is no reason for evolution to avoid this outcome.  A being which has
<br>
continuous, connected consciousness, like us, has no survival advantage
<br>
over one who suffers the fate of having his consciousness constantly
<br>
being destroyed.  Therefore there is a substantial chance that worlds
<br>
where consciousness evolves may indeed be just like World X.  Thank
<br>
goodness that we were one of the lucky worlds!
<br>
<p>In fact, I just had a horrifying thought... too terrible to share with
<br>
others... about our own world.  I shudder to even imagine it.  But could
<br>
it be true?
<br>
<p>Hal
