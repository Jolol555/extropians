<p>
[Just something I wrote in the early northern morning, inspired by the 
<br>
fierce growth of the surrounding vegitation and some discussions about 
<br>
the need for values to meet green conservatism. ]
<br>
<p><p>I have a vision of the future. 
<br>
<p>Within a fairly short time we will have the technological tools to 
<br>
manipulate matter at the molecular scale, making both manufacturing and 
<br>
recycling nearly perfect. Advances in artificial intelligence will 
<br>
enable more or less smart devices to act on their own, allowing teams of 
<br>
robots to build vast structures as desired or process enormous amounts 
<br>
of information in order to design solutions to many problems. We will 
<br>
have the tools to redesign ourselves and our environment according to 
<br>
our visions.
<br>
<p>Soon the solar system will change beyond recognition. Surrounding the 
<br>
Earth space habitats with their own artificial ecospheres will orbit in 
<br>
vast bands. Within each there is room for millions of people to shape 
<br>
their own culture. Similar, but even vaster habitats are being wrought 
<br>
by the material of the asteroid belt and the cometary nuclei. Slowly a 
<br>
sphere is being formed by millions of habitats, solar power collectors 
<br>
and other devices around the sun drinking its life-giving energy and 
<br>
radiating communications of all kinds. In the end most of the solar 
<br>
output will be used by life rather than dissipate into the cold of 
<br>
space.
<br>
<p>On Mars eagles soar above the Valles Marineris and dolphins explore the 
<br>
new Boralis Sea as ecopiesis and terraforming makes it inhabitable. What 
<br>
started out as a apocalypse of comets guided to crash into the planet 
<br>
and self-replicating nanomachines producing greenhouse gasses, breaking 
<br>
down carbonate rocks and freeing water first made the planet warm and 
<br>
wet enough for life . mostly genetically modified algae and lichens . to 
<br>
survive on their own. Gradually the life transformed the environment 
<br>
into something more and more terrestrial species could inhabit. Mars 
<br>
will never become a copy of Earth; the lower gravity, the red rocks, the 
<br>
uneven seasons, colder and dryer climate and the two moons will make 
<br>
sure of that. Over the eons life will adapt more fully to Mars until 
<br>
what started out as transplanted species will have become entirely new 
<br>
species that are truly native.
<br>
<p>On Mercury an ecosystem of machines is thriving. Self-replicating 
<br>
machines mine the rocky surface, extracting metals and semiconductors 
<br>
they use to build solar collectors. Deliberately designed to evolve they 
<br>
are inventing an ecology of glittering artificial life in shapes 
<br>
unimaginable to human planning. Some solutions are as creative and 
<br>
unexpected as wood . a wonderful material with many desirable 
<br>
properties, but nothing that any engineer could deliberately think up . 
<br>
and serve as inspiration for the rest of the solar system.
<br>
<p>In the seas of Europa adapted deep-sea lifeforms are slowly colonising 
<br>
the volcanic vents on the bottom of the sea. Most of them are variants 
<br>
of the ecologies around terrestrial volcanic vents, but strange new 
<br>
algae designed to make use of the weak light and heat now live beneath 
<br>
the thick ice. On Earth they have survived in their nearly unchanging 
<br>
ecological niche for hundreds of millions of years; on Europa their 
<br>
niche will likely persist for billions of years. 
<br>
<p>In the tar-like seas of ethane on Titan new forms of life designed from 
<br>
scratch are evolving. Instead of water they use hydrocarbons, and 
<br>
instead of photosynthesis they gather nutrients raining down from the 
<br>
clouds and the forces of the vast tidal flows. 
<br>
<p>And around the gas planets vast projects are underway to build ships 
<br>
that will bring the seeds of the solar system outwards to other stars. 
<br>
Fuelled by energy from the enormous solar collectors and mass from the 
<br>
gas atmospheres, they hold the collected information of the life of the 
<br>
solar system . genomes, human culture, the blueprints for new habitats. 
<br>
Are they crewed? Some might be filled with humans or human descendants, 
<br>
others by our artificial descendants or simple replication systems. Once 
<br>
they reach another system they will settle on a suitable asteroid and 
<br>
use it to build a larger base with room for greater minds, who in turn 
<br>
will use their stored knowledge and equipment to built yet larger and 
<br>
more versatile homes. Just as a tiny seed can unfold a few small leaves 
<br>
and roots that gives it the energy and nutrients needed to grow more 
<br>
leaves, more roots and strive towards the sun, the solar system seeds 
<br>
will bootstrap themselves into ever greater and diverse forms once they 
<br>
reach their destination and finally become adult civilisations. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Lets zoom outwards in time and space. From the perspective of the galaxy 
<br>
the yellow dwarf star on the outskirts of the Orion arm has never been 
<br>
unusual. But first it sends out a burst of strangely ordered radio 
<br>
signals. Soon afterwards it begins to change as if the solar system 
<br>
around it was turning into a globe more carefully using its energy for 
<br>
something. Nearly instantly . a few scant millennia . other stars in the 
<br>
vicinity begins to change in a variety of ways. A wavefront is expanding 
<br>
outwards turning empty solar systems and raw matter into something new 
<br>
and complex: habitats for life. In some cases this might be the 
<br>
terraforming of planets or the construction of habitats in space. In 
<br>
other cases entire planets are dismantled to build enormous concentric 
<br>
shells of energy collection, computing nodes and cooling systems that 
<br>
enable vast computer networks to house information ecologies far more 
<br>
complex than the biological one that once grew on the first planet. Here 
<br>
and there entire stars are disassembled to provide for longer lasting 
<br>
sources of warmth than they would naturally be. As the wavefront passes 
<br>
the galaxy changes, becomes a home to life and thought and not just to 
<br>
mass and energy. 
<br>
<p>And after it has transformed the milky way the wave continues outwards . 
<br>
to the Magellanic clouds, to Andromeda and the other galaxies in the 
<br>
local cluster, taking the vast jump to the Virgo cluster, embracing the 
<br>
local supercluster and beyond. This is my vision of the future: a future 
<br>
where life embraces and fills the universe.
<br>
<p><p><p>One might argue that what I have described is not the triumph of life 
<br>
but the triumph of human culture and technology. But what is human 
<br>
culture and technology but an expression of life? The human species is 
<br>
just another species doing what it can to survive. In our case we 
<br>
stumbled on the unusual ecological niche of making tools to help us and 
<br>
eventually build our own ecological niches, something which was aided by 
<br>
(or perhaps caused by, causing or co-evolving with) our vast 
<br>
communications and thinking abilities. There are many species that use 
<br>
simple tools to survive better, or construct environments that please 
<br>
them . insect larvae assembling gravel coatings, birds picking 
<br>
caterpillars with sticks, corals constructing reefs. Are they in any 
<br>
respect different from our clothing, hammers and cities? A city is not 
<br>
just an artefact but also an ecosystem: countless other species have 
<br>
moved in and survive there thanks to the actions of the keystone species 
<br>
Homo sapiens. Given enough time natural evolution would likely produce 
<br>
adaptations to city life among the plants and animals just as bizarre 
<br>
and beautiful as the one seen on coral reefs and in tropical jungles. It 
<br>
is only because our cities are so young and not intended to be 
<br>
ecosystems (and because we do not pay attention) they appear 
<br>
impoverished and sterile. 
<br>
<p>It is true that humans will play a key role in this vision. But it is 
<br>
not primarily a story about the hegemony of humanity over the natural 
<br>
world. It is true that this vision has room for all varieties of human 
<br>
futures and ambitions, from quiet contemplation to vastening into 
<br>
godlike posthuman states. While the humans might consider themselves the 
<br>
rulers, they are unwittingly serving life by expanding its niches to new 
<br>
places, places where life would never have been able to go naturally. 
<br>
Evolution can never reach a local optimum separated from current species 
<br>
by a sufficiently broad desert of non-viable species; no matter what it 
<br>
cannot evolve the molecular machinery to build diamond skeletons, 
<br>
spaceflight or survival on Mercury. This is something that requires what 
<br>
is currently uniquely human, foresight and technology. Intelligence is 
<br>
necessary for the long-term survival and expansion of life. By expanding 
<br>
outwards (for whatever reasons) humanity brings with itself other 
<br>
species. Some as food and companions, some as freeriders and parasites 
<br>
and likely, when crossing great gulfs, many .just in case. to make sure 
<br>
no diversity is lost. Some might be visionaries wanting to save or 
<br>
expand life for its own sake, but the beauty is that not all humans need 
<br>
to be. A vision that required all humans to act as one would remain just 
<br>
a beautiful vision; a vision merely requiring that humans continue to do 
<br>
what it always has done is far more likely. 
<br>
<p>Pessimists among us might complain that in the past we humans have often 
<br>
destroyed the environment of life, and that this is also something that 
<br>
is likely to continue. But most of this destruction has been due to 
<br>
ignorance and limited resources: when you are half starving you do not 
<br>
care that your next meal is an endangered keystone species. It is thanks 
<br>
to the affluence and efficiency of modern technology we can reduce our 
<br>
ecological footprints and undo some of the damage. If one believes that 
<br>
mankind is always the destroyer, then my vision is not possible. But 
<br>
given that assumption no other positive vision of the future is 
<br>
possible, not even sustainability on the Earth. On the other hand, if 
<br>
one assumes humanity can take care of its biosphere (however 
<br>
imperfectly), then there is no hindrance to spreading that biosphere 
<br>
outwards and hoping for the best. 
<br>
<p>As I see it the word life should not be interpreted narrowly and 
<br>
parochially as our particular kind of water-protein organisation but as 
<br>
complex self-replicating and evolving systems as a whole. The machine 
<br>
ecology of Mercury, the methane ecology of Titan and the software living 
<br>
within the vast computing networks are all examples of generalised life. 
<br>
We will not just expand the niches of traditional life but also create 
<br>
new kinds of life . as experiments, as art, as adaptations. And these 
<br>
forms of life are equally worth our reverence and appreciation as the 
<br>
traditional wet kind. There is no fundamental difference between created 
<br>
and born life, except possibly that the former has a morally responsible 
<br>
.parent.. 
<br>
<p>Some readers no doubt find my vision distasteful just because it 
<br>
replaces the natural with the artificial. There are those who argue that 
<br>
terraforming a planet is a crime against its natural environment. But 
<br>
when plants begin to colonise a newly formed volcanic island, is that a 
<br>
crime? Hardly, and it is seen as natural. Would it be a crime to 
<br>
deliberately scatter seeds on the island? It might have less of the 
<br>
appeal of surprise a natural scattering would have engendered in a human 
<br>
observer, but from the perspective of the plants and rocks there is no 
<br>
difference. Scattering seeds across the universe is the same thing on a 
<br>
vast scale.  Perhaps most important, life remakes itself. A typical tool 
<br>
when left to itself will not change (except for some decay). Life 
<br>
reproduces and evolves, exploring new possibilities almost by 
<br>
definition. Even a strictly manufactured living environment will become 
<br>
something else given enough time. It will become born rather than made, 
<br>
but it could not exist without the initial manufacture. Humanity is both 
<br>
steward of life and a player in its emergence. 
<br>
<p>One might argue that this is just a .quantity is quality. vision, that 
<br>
the number of living things do not matter. Why convert teratonnes or 
<br>
matter into plants, animals and humans when only a few would be 
<br>
necessary? But the same argument suggests that we would be just as well 
<br>
off with a single patch of vegetation in an otherwise empty gravel 
<br>
desert as an entire meadow. One reason the meadow is better than the 
<br>
patch is that it can sustain more species and more complexity than the 
<br>
patch; it can be a part of the interplay between biomes. It is also more 
<br>
stable to damage and is needed to sustain large animals like horses. But 
<br>
it is also necessary to allow more uniqueness. As I see it life has an 
<br>
inherent worth compared to the matter and energy of the universe. It has 
<br>
the potential of growth, change and awareness disorganised rock and 
<br>
plasma lack. Due to its evolutionary and individual past each organism 
<br>
is contingent . it was shaped due to its genes and surroundings in an 
<br>
unique way that will never occur again. Each of us, each blade of grass 
<br>
or bacteria, is a kind of one-of-a-kind snowflake. I hope the universe 
<br>
will be filled with a snowstorm of these.
<br>
<p>What about other life in the universe? In this ecological vision there 
<br>
is not just room for it, it is something to be sought out, cherished and 
<br>
spread just as we will spread our own kind. Life is life. 
<br>
<p>What about the alternative to my vision? Imagine the following 
<br>
.sustainable. vision: mankind contents itself to the Earth, remaining 
<br>
static either deliberately or by quietly dying out. Life continues on 
<br>
Earth, while the bodies of the solar system revolve as nothing has 
<br>
happened. Species come and go on Earth, while the sun slowly but 
<br>
inexorably increases in luminosity. In a few hundred million years the 
<br>
increasing heat overcomes the homeostasis of the biosphere and it 
<br>
largely dies out, leaving a Venus-like world of heavy smog and gravel. 
<br>
In a few billion years the sun grows into a red giant and engulfs the 
<br>
inner system. What is eventually left is either a frozen husk of slag 
<br>
orbiting a white dwarf or just a hint of extra lithium in the spectrum 
<br>
of the planetary nebula around it. 
<br>
<p>Is this vision desirable? It is the .natural. chain of events that will 
<br>
result if humanity does not change things. There is room within it for 
<br>
billions of species and thousands of grand civilisations. But it ends 
<br>
ignominiously and it is fundamentally limited. 
<br>
<p>On a larger scale there might be biospheres emerging all the time around 
<br>
distant stars: small stalks of grass growing in the dark soil of the 
<br>
Milky Way. But without intelligence supporting them they all shrivel and 
<br>
die before any chance of seeding. Each biosphere, filled with uniqueness 
<br>
and potential, will vanish without a trace, without even one conscious 
<br>
observer.
<br>
<p>The desire to protect the natural is a desire to protect the contingent 
<br>
and valuable from the ravages of entropy . or just conservatism 
<br>
devaluing human ambition and creativity. Unfortunately the two are often 
<br>
confused. This vision is all about protecting and nurturing nature at 
<br>
its largest by means of vast human ambition. The triumph of the 
<br>
denigration of the artificial and deliberate would be not just the 
<br>
abandonment of humanity but also the eventual betrayal of the only 
<br>
chance life has to continue growing. 
<br>
<p>It has been said that growth is the ideology of the cancer cell. This is 
<br>
true, but it is also the ideology of the orchid. Without constant 
<br>
attempts to sprout seeds everywhere the orchid would die out. Even if it 
<br>
did survive at a guaranteed constant number it would not have any 
<br>
incentive to evolve. It is the constant struggle to produce more orchids 
<br>
that have made orchids evolve their bulbs and air-roots, their amazing 
<br>
flowers to entice insects and vast variety of ecological niches. It is 
<br>
thanks to growth and evolution that we achieve beauty. 
<br>
<p>I propose that we will turn the universe into a garden.
