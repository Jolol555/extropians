OK. I haven't quite got the hang of this list yet. It's hard to tell
<br>
sometime who said what. One of you said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Doesn't mean that a few civilizations might not get it wrong from
<br>
time to time -- but if there is a &quot;Galactic Club&quot; established it
<br>
seems likely that it will quickly crack down hard on such foolish
<br>
civiliztions.&quot;
<br>
<p>We could solve this one quite easily. Let's send a probe and see if the
<br>
&quot;Galactic Club&quot; steps in!

<em>&gt; &gt; Robert, I don't get the feeling you take serious the &quot;just one problem&quot;

<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand your point.  I'll try to provide some justification.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It looks like we will soon have the technology to send out a genesis
</em><br>
probe (the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; von Neumann machine on the end of a rocket).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep.  But it raises the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (a) Why in the blazes would one do that?  Given that it may be sowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      the seeds for the destruction of oneself or ones civilization).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      [For the sowing of a genesis probe to make sense you also have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       to argue that the civilization is monumentally stupid or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       self-destructive (in the long run)].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (b) One has to argue that SR probes will not have been eliminated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      more advanced civilizations (as a really bad idea).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So one is only left with the possibility that a very &quot;early&quot; advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological civilization sent out SR-probes (which will ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come back to haunt it) and they managed to get a sufficient foothold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow their survival before more sensible minds came to dominate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This scenario *may* have happened in some galaxies -- which is why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I view the exploration of what is &quot;out there&quot; with some interest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I'll note this week we seem to have both observations that stars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with higher metal content are more likely to have jupiter class planets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as the fact that there seem to be galaxies that only consist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hydrogen gas (given our limited observational capabilities)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are a *lot* of possibilities that we have not considered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If we don't send out such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probe it looks for all the world that this must be a political decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No -- absolutely not.  Not sending out a SR probe is ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;survival decision&quot;.  One does *not* want ones foolish youthful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions (&quot;oh -- lets just see what is out there&quot;) to come back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to haunt you in old age as in (&quot;oh dad, I notice that my sun is running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of hydrogen so why don't I simply 'borrow' some from your sun&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Duh...  I think even spike would be willing to agree that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't &quot;rocket science&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't mean that a few civilizations might not get it wrong from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to time -- but if there is a &quot;Galactic Club&quot; established it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems likely that it will quickly crack down hard on such foolish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civiliztions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is an interesting question (for an advanced civilization) --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there *were* a &quot;Galactic Club&quot; (something that you cannot in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any way be certain of due to speed-of-light delays in ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of the state of the galaxy) -- how would one view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a civilization that would behave so stupidly as to send out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SR probes in a Universe that one suspects (given current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations) has finite resources?  (So one is going to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to eliminate the self-replicators *sooner or later*.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Are there galactic iron laws that prohibit us from doing this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No -- but I think there may be logical conclusions that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational species may reach and therefore they end up becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;law of the land&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you have to argue that there are &quot;advanced technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations&quot; that are quite misinformed (i.e. they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not bothered to scan the galaxy for signs of intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity -- [note I said &quot;signs&quot; and not &quot;communication&quot;])
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or else they are not rational.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might be an interesting discussion -- &quot;what would be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longevity of a non-rational civilization?&quot;  (We can use humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a marker perhaps -- we may be pushing towards 10,000 years with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semi-rationality.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [snip] then one of them would have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the imprudent thing long ago and there should be genesis probes here
</em><br>
right
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, one can be &quot;imprudent&quot;.  Going in that direction raises any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of questions.  I'll point out only two:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) how can one guarantee there is not an alien presence within this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar system specifically tasked with keeping us from behaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imprudently?  It doesn't even have to be particularly intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (how intelligent does it have to be to prevent SR probes from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving the solar system...);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) Have you seriously considered the intelligence scales?  An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MBrain has around 10^42 OPS.  A probe has what 10^13?  (Somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than a human even if you are using moderately advanced tech).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you seriously propose that the &quot;imprudent&quot; behavior is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survive in galaxy where &quot;prudent&quot; behavior has a selective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; easily imagine a group of Nietzscheans saying that they think launching
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genesis probe is the highest manifestation of their will to power,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good example *but* I think you need to qualify it as being a bunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of extremely unintelligent Nietzscheans who really do not care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own survival.  And they only get lucky if they &quot;happen&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exert their &quot;power&quot; at the precise point in galactic evolution when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might be successful.  And given the speed of light delays there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably no way of knowing that.  So they are playing a very high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stakes game.  And in most high stakes games one loses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are a reasonable number of advanced civilizations then there must
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iron laws: political laws stopping genesis probes--a galactic UN of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sorts--or some as yet unknown laws of the universe that prevent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; launching of a genesis probe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah-ha -- so we come to some meeting of the minds -- perhaps.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be &quot;political&quot; rules preventing probes but there may be both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some logical rules (that civilizations impose upon themselves) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well as interdiction efforts (imposed by any galactic clubs).  Where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *we* (humanity) reside in this development process needs quite a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more information before we can make any well qualified judgements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would feel.
