&lt;me&gt; it can, ergo why people discuss history.  At least that occurred         
<br>
in our universe; thus its far more likely to be relevant.  Thats the          
<br>
nice                                                                          
<br>
thing about history; there's so many different viewpoints to examine and      
<br>
choose from, and hindsight is always 20/20.                                   
<br>
<p><p>Where do you get those perfect retroglasses? I could use a pair - and I'd LOVE
<br>
to forward pairs to the SCOTUS, congresscritters, the executive branch, etc...
<br>
<p>What am I saying, they'll just look at the parts they want to see, anyways.
<br>
*big sigh* Oh well, it was a good thought while it lasted...
<br>
<p><p>[charles] whereas in the book one                                             
<br>
knows, or can know, the complete context.                                     
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; Thats facetious at best; you're reading a fiction book.  Unless you      
<br>
are                                                                           
<br>
the author, you have absolutely no idea what the complete context             
<br>
of the book is; just what the author has currently decided to expose          
<br>
to the reader.  Furthermore, there is nothing to indicate that a valid        
<br>
comparison can be necessarily drawn from the book mapping to our              
<br>
current reality.  If they were doing a book review, than yes,                 
<br>
I'ld agree &lt;within the bounds of the book&gt;; they are however,                 
<br>
discussing real-life effects of the genocide of human beings.                 
<br>
Pointing out the fictional character had second thoughts while                
<br>
nice, is really not that useful.  Arguing the reason (or rationale)           
<br>
the author used to generate that particular fictional response                
<br>
might be.  Using that rationale as conclusive proof however, is               
<br>
not.                                                                          
<br>
<p><p>Agreed, it's a book. It's a fiction. However, if it's a good book (by which
<br>
I mean that the reader doesn't have to suspend disbelief TOO much), it gives
<br>
you a rough thought experiment, all nicely written out and shared amongst many
<br>
people throughout the community of readers, to draw on to help explain other
<br>
events.
<br>
<p><p>-snip-                                                                        
<br>
One final thought; what the media and movies (and yes, even                   
<br>
fictional works in their heyday) represent does not indicate the              
<br>
norm in reality.  Its a shame people have such difficulty in                  
<br>
observing the difference.                                                     
<br>
<p><p>Good catch - and most fiction is escapist at best, agreed. However, even so,
<br>
I find that I can explain libertarianism easier to a sci-fi crowd by invoking
<br>
Heinlein, as just one example.
