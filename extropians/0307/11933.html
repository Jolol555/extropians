<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think so, too, and I sent a letter to that effect to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As a matter of law, *why* do the judges need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somehow swallow that? Is pathetic delusion or its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mere symptom itself now a crime. And if so which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are the minority religious faiths and how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; astrologers are there crowding French jails?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Alas then, for the land of Voltaire and the birthplace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of *liberty*, equality, fraternity, when judges presume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to judge science or pre-judge scientific possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and set aside the principle that even fools that harm no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one by their eccentric choices should be denied their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right to make such choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. [You mean &quot;should not&quot;.]
</em><br>
<p>Yes, sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, first, civil liberties in France are not as prioritary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as they are in the US. You know the famous quote by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Voltaire regarding freedom of speech: &quot;I totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with you, but I will fight so that you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express yourself.&quot;; well, in France you can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemned if you say that the number of Jews killed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WW II is X, rather than Y.
</em><br>
<p>I'd only heard it translated as &quot;I may not agree with what
<br>
you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it&quot;.
<br>
which I guess, even if accurate might not be very useful
<br>
when death is itself part of the issue.
<br>
<p>I'd not realised the restrictions on free speach went so
<br>
far in France. By &quot;condemned&quot; do you mean that it is
<br>
actually illegal or just politically incorrect? Australia
<br>
has racial vilification laws which restrict some speech
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, they are considered dead. I am not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how the liberties of individuals are kept by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;them&quot; when they die in French law.
</em><br>
<p>My guess would be they wouldn't be. But I'd be
<br>
pretty surprised if there is not some sort of voluntary
<br>
organisation in France concerned with civil liberties.
<br>
<p>Australia does not have a Bill of Rights like the US
<br>
and States can therefore theoretically pass laws here
<br>
to do just about anything to an individual (there
<br>
are no specific constitutional protections), our civil
<br>
rights are political rather than legal constructs. There
<br>
is a Victorian Council for Civil Liberties which
<br>
acts as a political lobby group and which has a
<br>
membership that is largely made up of lawyers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is an administrative law (which is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not anti-constitutional) that says how dead bodies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be disposed with, and it offers the choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between earth or fire, but not ice. And such law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; settles the situation, seen from a magistrate. Again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it regards DEAD bodies; so framing it in terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of individual liberties, especially in a laic State (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Giulio rightly mentioned), may not make much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HENCE, though not a lawyer myself, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an expert of French law, I think that one should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show that cryonics has some plausibility, in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to show that the administrative law that says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how corpses are disposed with is not the relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; juridical frame for the situation.
</em><br>
<p>I think the pivotal figure in arguing cryonics through
<br>
the courts in the US was Greg Fahy. I'm not sure if
<br>
he could or would be able to assist. I'd be pretty
<br>
surprised if he had not heard of the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I add a post-scriptum on this, regarding the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point. Not being French, when I first came here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was all vibrant against the violations of individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberties. Then I came to realize that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tension between &quot;liberty&quot;, and &quot;equality and fraternity&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I've heard that argued somewhere too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US constitution is great on the first. The French is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better on the two last. Some restrictions of individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberties do make sense in this system, which has some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good aspects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't debate that here, though. I just wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid a position of saying: &quot;Yes! Of course you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right! French are fools! Everyone knows that!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the French are fools. I still drink milk
<br>
that's Pasteurised ;-) But French law comes from a
<br>
different tradition to Australian and US law which
<br>
were both based on English law. Unfortunately I
<br>
don't know enough about French law to help.
<br>
My questions below were really meant to be
<br>
rhetorical suggestions.
<br>
<p>If I was going to try and resolve a similar legal
<br>
problem with cryonics in Australia I'd look to the
<br>
civil libertarian organisations as natural allies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think they have followed a different path, coming from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Voltaire and the Revolution, which makes some sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Liberalism is good at redirecting competitive instinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into socially productive behaviour. But the ideals of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; French Revolution go beyond that.)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Is there no organisation of civil libertarians in France?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Are there no philosophers or lawyers students that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wish to be famous and launch or rejuvenate their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; careers in defence of an old principle of freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even when to do so would ensure that they would get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their names in the paper and a wealth of publicity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Not a bad idea. In Switzerland, I could more easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make such connections (all the more so as my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; father is a lawyer in Geneva...). However, not here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll have a try to target such population with such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, now I understand, your name is French-Swiss I
<br>
was assuming you were French.:-)
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People understand that taxes, for example, is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restriction of individual liberty that is coherent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last two thirds of the republican trinity. As are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the restrictions on freedom of speech on the grounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;incitation à la haine raciale&quot; [incitement to racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hatred]. Different cultural path, different tradition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for best and worse.
</em><br>
<p>Seem Australia is somewhere between the US and
<br>
France then with our racial vilification laws.
<br>

<br>
