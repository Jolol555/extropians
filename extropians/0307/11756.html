</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The Luddites continue to win, legislatively, commercially, and in

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have said this to you many time, Mike:  Start your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization.  If you can do it better than anyone else, then do it!
</em><br>
<p>That isn't the point. You claimed that you were achieving things. I
<br>
asked you to name them. You can't, so you deflect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt; But I'm not going to state here what my plans are at this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is par for the course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it is not par for the course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You just went to a meeting where you were inspired to pursue your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activistic yearnings and now you are blaming me for there not being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an outlet for you to be an activist.  
</em><br>
<p>This isn't about me, Natasha, so stop trying to flip it over. Nor did I
<br>
&quot;just went to a meeting&quot;, since I've been a member of the FSP since it
<br>
started in 2001, about the same time as Extro5 when you announced the
<br>
formation of Pro-Act. I used the FSP as an example of how a successful
<br>
organization works (and how successful it has been in the same time
<br>
period that Pro-Act has been in existence) to contrast with your utter
<br>
and abject failure and lack of communication, cooperation, or
<br>
commitment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not the person to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blaming.  The fact that I did not pass on the baton for Pro-Act is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) no one qualified to take it on emailed me asking to help out; 
</em><br>
<p>i.e. when I emailed you, offering my help and support, and I got
<br>
absolutely no response from you, it is because you thought I was not
<br>
qualified... which confirms my earlier statement that you used Pro-Act
<br>
to deflect the community from supporting my efforts which preceded
<br>
yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) I could not think of any one person who was objective enough to
</em><br>
take it on;
<br>
<p>Which only demonstrates you have no idea what it takes to run an
<br>
activist organization. Objectivism doesn't count as a major
<br>
qualification, moreover your opinion of me as not being objective is
<br>
only because my anti-Green leanings conflict with your Green leanings.
<br>
How objective is that on your part?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (3) I was not sure if Pro-Act was indeed the right direction to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go in with dealing with the current political and social global 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-biotechnology leanings.
</em><br>
<p>Then why did you even start it? Perhaps because you saw my efforts as a
<br>
threat to your position as the queen of extropia?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While Pro-Act was timely and could have been an effective activist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization for warding off the luddites, in hindsight it was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the direction I think best uses our extropic transhumanist ideas. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of fighting the opposition, it is might be more meaningful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate with the opposition.  After so much name calling between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transhumanist organizations - Socialist, Libertarian, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian, Democratic, Marxist, Facist, Republican, etc. et al., 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seemed that moving beyond the obvious politicalized transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentiment is a better way of dealing with how people &quot;think.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Communicating with the opposition doesn't work when they are outlawing
<br>
your existence. Do you really think that Lenin was at all interested in
<br>
receiving communication from the Mensheviks? That Mao was at all
<br>
interested in parlaying with the Nationalists?
<br>
<p>Nor is communicating with luddites something we should even deal with.
<br>
Activism in a polarizing plenum is the way it works and the way people
<br>
do it, BECAUSE that is the way that DOES work best. It aint pretty, and
<br>
it can be stressful, but it is necessary because neither side is going
<br>
to quit until they are proven wrong by history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am more interested in the architecture of how people think and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;design&quot; of changing thinking than I am &quot;fighting&quot; the opposition. 
</em><br>
<p>That isn't the sort of attitude that makes ANY sort of progress
<br>
possible. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We may never change the way a many in the Greenpeace community or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Rifkin community, or the Leon Cass community, but we can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design ways that will help people communicate about the problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more effectively.
</em><br>
<p>That isn't going to be worth anything when they've obsoleted your
<br>
exisence and purpose by draconian legislation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the latest newsletter I asked people to comment.  That would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been a great opportunity to you to communicate with me about what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are doing.
</em><br>
<p>Cut the horseshit, Natasha. I've attempted to communicate with you
<br>
several times over the last two years about this issue and I've been
<br>
totally rebuffed. Greg Burch knows this because I've communicated with
<br>
him my concerns and asked him what the hell is going on with you
<br>
people. You have not returned any of my emails about this issue since Extro5.
