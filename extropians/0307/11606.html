<p>
Perhaps many of you will recall the excellent
<br>
pitch by Greg Stock at Extro4 regarding the
<br>
effect of cash prizes on scientific research.  
<br>
I suggested at that time that we have an excellent 
<br>
test case with the collaborative online background
<br>
computing effort, GIMPS.  With GIMPS we have an
<br>
hourly-updated measure of participation, so it
<br>
is idea for testing Dr. Stock's theories.  My 
<br>
notion at the time was that not only the amount 
<br>
of the prize but also the actual award structure 
<br>
that is of primary interest.
<br>
<p>This contention has been wonderfully verified
<br>
by an observation I have made over the past
<br>
few months: As a result of the Electronic 
<br>
Frontier Foundation's cash reward, the total 
<br>
computational thru-put of GIMPS has risen 
<br>
steadily, but ironically the productivity (output)
<br>
has begun to actually decline.  {8-[
<br>
<p>This paradox is a result of the structure of
<br>
the prize.  EFF offered $50k for the first
<br>
million digit prime, $100k for the first 10 million
<br>
digit prime, $150k for the first 1E8 and $200k
<br>
for the first billion digit.  EFF offered no
<br>
explanation for the odd prize structure,
<br>
but he who pays the piper calls the tune.
<br>
<p>The million digit $50k prize was claimed
<br>
in June 1999.  The GIMPS project progressed steadily
<br>
to where it is now searching in the 6 million
<br>
digit range, but currently more and more of the 
<br>
new accounts, signing on with the newer and
<br>
faster computers, are jumping ship and searching
<br>
up in the 10 million digit range. A 2GHz processor
<br>
can complete a 1E7 search in a reasonable time 
<br>
(about a month) and a one-in-50,000 chance at 
<br>
$100k is worth a couple bucks in a sense, so 
<br>
why not collect the free lottery tickets?
<br>
<p>This strategy makes the probability of
<br>
of finding a record prime on any given day
<br>
actually decline, since fewer candidates can be
<br>
checked (each one takes longer) and each candidate 
<br>
has a lower probability of being prime (approximately
<br>
in proportion to the number of digits).  Furthermore, 
<br>
if the prize is claimed before the rest of the GIMPS 
<br>
effort can catch up (extremely likely), it may be many 
<br>
years hence before the two Mersenne primes hiding in 
<br>
the 6 to 10 million digit range are discovered.  
<br>
Furthermore the EFF prize will surely create an 
<br>
even larger unsearched gap in the 10 million to 
<br>
100 million digit range, with few volunteers willing
<br>
to search for the biggies that will not set any
<br>
records, resulting in little fame or riches.
<br>
<p>So while the EFF prize may have provided financial
<br>
motivation in some cases, it has kinda messed up 
<br>
this one area of research.  One could say prime 
<br>
number research has been EFFed, in a way perhaps
<br>
analogous to the way modern medical research is 
<br>
spending more resources trying to cure impotence 
<br>
and baldness than on life extension, for that is
<br>
where the money is.

<p>PS does anyone here have Dr. Stock's email @?
<br>
Please forward this note to him.  s
