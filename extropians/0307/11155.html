From:  Karen Rand Smigrodzki
<br>
... I was also thinking that the effect of riding a motorcycle might
<br>
make your hormonal levels change...(It makes me wonder if the guys in
<br>
the late 1800's had the same effect riding in their horseless
<br>
carriages.)...
<br>
<p><p><p>Karen, here is an insight from my own misspent youth.
<br>
Knowing that motorcycles caused my own raging hormones
<br>
to rise to even more mind-numbing heights, I sought to 
<br>
discover what activity would have a similar effect on
<br>
women, in order to be present when those activities
<br>
were taking place.  I asked my friend, who was well known
<br>
to understand the mysteries of the female of the species.  
<br>
He advised I attend horse related events, and observe 
<br>
closely the powerful effect these strong and gentle beasts 
<br>
had on women.
<br>
<p>I did so, observing carefully the horses and the
<br>
way they managed to capture the hearts of their
<br>
riders.  I got a date with a girl I knew to be a
<br>
horse lover.  Foregoing the usual (and proven 
<br>
unreliable) technique of actual conversation, I
<br>
substituted neighing and whinneying, with the
<br>
occasional B-B-B-B-B-B-B flappy lips thing that
<br>
horses often do for no apparent reason.  My date 
<br>
excused herself to the powder room, and never 
<br>
returned.  I learned she had changed her phone 
<br>
number and moved away leaving no forwarding address.  
<br>
Note to self: No horse lips.
<br>
<p>Reported back to my friend who conceded that my
<br>
technique would only have worked had I shared
<br>
certain physical characteristics with horses.
<br>
Of course *any* technique would have worked, had
<br>
that been the case, which I assured him it was not.
<br>
He suggested that perhaps I was emulating the wrong
<br>
beast, that in fact the aarvark was the lifeform
<br>
of choice.  &quot;You wait for just the right moment,&quot;
<br>
says he, &quot;Then you go down on the old anthill.  
<br>
Works like magic.&quot;
<br>
<p>So I got a new date.  The conversation was on the
<br>
topic of the life cycle and habits of the aardvark.
<br>
Things started going well.  Verrrry well, if you
<br>
catch my drift. (Wink)  So, just at the critical 
<br>
moment, I went down, poked my snoot in the anthill.  
<br>
The ensuing commotion ensured me it was having the
<br>
desired effect.  
<br>
<p>I was mistaken, however, for upon looking up I
<br>
found that again my date had fled.  The commotion
<br>
was half a dozen passers-by, pointing and inquiring
<br>
as to the exact nature of my major malfunction.  My
<br>
date requested a court order to keep me at bay,
<br>
and just for good measure had entered the Federal
<br>
witness protection program.  Just as well, for it
<br>
took several days for the swelling to subside on my
<br>
nose from all the bites from the angry ants, who
<br>
had lived many generations without having been 
<br>
attacked by an aardvark.  Note to self: no aarvarks.
<br>
<p>I began to doubt the advise of my friend, and
<br>
decided to emulate a different creature on my
<br>
next date: an amoeba, with money.  That worked.
<br>
She married me.
