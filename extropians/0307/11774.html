<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yet another of our pet topics gone mainstream:

<em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/07/19/aging/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/07/19/aging/index.html</a>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;...SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Fancy living 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another 100 years or more? Some experts said on Saturday that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific advances will one day enable humans to last 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decades beyond what is now seen as the natural limit of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human life span.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I think we are knocking at the door of immortality,&quot; said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Michael Zey, a Montclair State University business professor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and author of two books on the future. &quot;I think by 2075 we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will see it and that's a conservative estimate...&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was actually rather uncomfortable with this.  Zey made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this pronouncement without any real scientific grounding. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I saw his talk at World Future Society this weekend, where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Smart, Jose Cordeiro, and I were also speaking.)  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worry that loud public statements of this sort without a solid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific basis are more harmful than helpful.
</em><br>
<p>For some reason I can't get to this link. 
<br>
<p>Actually this was also a bit of a pattern shown (according
<br>
to Hall in MoI), by Michael West. Beyond mere enthusiasm
<br>
and positive thinking about ones enterprises there are strong
<br>
commercial incentives to hype ones business ventures in
<br>
the media. Investors presumably like to see the companies 
<br>
and personalities they have invested in reported on in the 
<br>
press. The press makes it easier to raise funds, at least whilst
<br>
some semblance of scientific credibility can be retained. They
<br>
serve as a source of free advertising. But at the end of the 
<br>
day, if the hype doesn't get realised, the suggestion is that 
<br>
more harm is done than good. 
<br>
<p>West apparently reported the production of a six celled
<br>
&quot;embryo&quot; via SCNT as a breakthrough in human cloning 
<br>
and was roundly and robustly criticised by the scientific
<br>
community for making the claim firstly in the media and
<br>
without serious peer review and secondly at a time when
<br>
the overstatement could have had particularly adverse 
<br>
effects on the legislative environment being debated around
<br>
therapeutic cloning. What would have been regarded by
<br>
scientists as a failure, (the attempted clone got no further
<br>
than six cells), West tried to plug as progress. And 
<br>
apparently it was felt that this was irresponsible science 
<br>
and played straight to the misperception that reproductive
<br>
cloning was imminent.
<br>
<p>Not only West, but I think Ventner and Hasseltine have also 
<br>
used similar hyped statements in the media as a means to get
<br>
free publicity and thereby facilitate further funding or boost
<br>
stock prices. Its all part of the game. 
<br>
<p>I am not sure myself though that the overhyping is always as
<br>
much as a problem as it is held to be. I guess it depends on 
<br>
the individual case.
<br>
<p>In which *particular* respects do you think hyped statements
<br>
like Zey's may be more harmful than helpful?
