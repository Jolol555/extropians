<p>These flying self replicating used needles may very well be the

harbringers of whatever disease does the human race in.  The solution is
<br>
simple, bring back DDT.  To talk about the consequences of ideas, and
<br>
the morally culpability for being believed, Rachel Carson is the
<br>
greatest mass murderer to have ever existed.  If extropians want to do
<br>
something extropian, save lives, and right scientific wrongs, DDT is the
<br>
best place to start.

<p>Michael Dickey
<br>
<p>From - <a href="http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/summ02/DDT.html">http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/articles/summ02/DDT.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;The 1972 U.S. ban on DDT is responsible for a genocide 10 times larger
<br>
than that for which we sent Nazis to the gallows at Nuremberg. It is
<br>
also responsible for a menticide which has already condemned one entire
<br>
generation to a dark age of anti-science ignorance, and is now infecting
<br>
a new one.
<br>
<p>The lies and hysteria spread to defend the DDT ban are typical of the
<br>
irrationalist, anti-science wave which has virtually destroyed rational
<br>
forms of discourse in our society. If you want to save science-and human
<br>
lives-the fight to bring back DDT...&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Sixty million people have died needlessly of malaria, since the
<br>
imposition of the 1972 ban on DDT, and hundreds of millions more have
<br>
suffered from this debilitating disease. The majority of those affected
<br>
are children. Of the 300 to 500 million new cases of malaria each year,
<br>
200 to 300 million are children, and malaria now kills one child every
<br>
30 seconds. Ninety percent of the reported cases of malaria are in
<br>
Africa, and 40 percent of the world's population, inhabitants of
<br>
tropical countries, are threatened by the increasing incidence of
<br>
malaria.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;As King correctly observed, the incidence of malaria, and its death
<br>
rates, were vastly reduced by DDT spraying. To take one example: Sri
<br>
Lanka (Ceylon) had 2.8 million cases of malaria and more than 12,500
<br>
deaths in 1946, before the use of DDT. In 1963, after a large-scale
<br>
spraying campaign, the number of cases fell to 17, and the number of
<br>
deaths fell to 1. But five years after the stop of spraying, in 1969,
<br>
the number of deaths had climbed to 113, and the number of cases to
<br>
500,000. Today, malaria rates have soared in countries that stopped
<br>
spraying. In South Africa, the malaria incidence increased by 1,000
<br>
percent in the late 1990s&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The Silent Spring Fraud
<br>
The campaign to ban DDT got its start with the publication of Rachel
<br>
Carson's book Silent Spring in 1962. Carson's popular book was a fraud.
<br>
She played on people's emotions, and to do so, she selected and
<br>
falsified data from scientific studies, as entomologist Dr. J. Gordon
<br>
Edwards has documented in his analysis of the original scientific
<br>
studies that Carson cited.2
<br>
<p>As a result of the propaganda and lies, the U.S. Environmental
<br>
Protection Agency convened scientific hearings and appointed a Hearing
<br>
Examiner, Edmund Sweeney, to run them. Every major scientific
<br>
organization in the world supported DDT use, submitted testimony, as did
<br>
the environmentalist opposition. The hearings went on for seven months,
<br>
and generated 9,000 pages of testimony. Hearing Examiner Sweeney then
<br>
ruled that DDT should not be banned, based on the scientific evidence:
<br>
&quot;DDT is not carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic to man [and] these
<br>
uses of DDT do not have a deleterious effect on fish, birds, wildlife,
<br>
or estuarine organisms,&quot; Sweeney concluded.
<br>
<p>Two months later, without even reading the testimony or attending the
<br>
hearings, EPA administrator William Ruckelshaus overruled the EPA
<br>
hearing officer and banned DDT. He later admitted that he made the
<br>
decision for &quot;political&quot; reasons. &quot;Science, along with economics, has a
<br>
role to play . .. .. [but] the ultimate decision remains political,&quot;
<br>
Ruckelshaus said.&quot;  .
