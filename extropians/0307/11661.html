<p>I would consider the ExI Principles a rational moral framework,
<br>
but as Anders points out they may be lacking with respect to
<br>
suggesting behaviors to adopt towards others, in particular any
<br>
whom have particularly entropic views and behavior patterns.
<br>
<p>Where things get messy is when ones intuition and the other
<br>
voices of wisdom get contradicted.
<br>
<p>One might cite dealings by societies with with known mass
<br>
murderers or sex offenders -- why does society not simply
<br>
eliminate these people (as humanely as possible)?
<br>
<p>What justifies the cost of supporting them (over a
<br>
term of life imprisonment) given the risk that they
<br>
pose to others should the escape or be paroled?
<br>
<p>I'm simply expanding the discussion somewhat.  Perhaps
<br>
I am looking for someone to say &quot;These fundamental
<br>
human rights trump any extropic moral framework.&quot;
<br>
<p>And then I'm looking for a rational, or intuition,
<br>
or wisdom based argument as to *why* that is the
<br>
case.  (Rather than say a genetic/tribal argument
<br>
that one simply doesn't &quot;kill&quot; other human beings
<br>
due to probable risks to oneself.  After all most
<br>
of us have no problem &quot;killing&quot; cattle, pigs,
<br>
chickens, many types of fish, etc. -- so it isn't
<br>
the &quot;killing&quot; aspect that upsets people.)
