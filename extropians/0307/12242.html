<p>Rafal may be better qualified to comment on this than I...

<p>Having seen first hand what the Russian &quot;collective&quot;

defeat of Hitler's armies, the reliable space program

(as Spike admits)) -- the question seems to come back

to &quot;what does one get?&quot; and &quot;what does it cost you?&quot;

<p>1. It is worth understanding that Russia went from essentially
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a feudal state to a superpower in less than 100 years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of the combination and Stalin and Hitler on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia range from 10 to 100 million lives lost.  One has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to wonder what might have been accomplished without the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unextropic vector (but under a similar &quot;command&quot; economy)?
