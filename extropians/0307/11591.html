<p>Mike, as a person whose name appears on the Pro-Act site and who heard
<br>
Natasha's idea before it went public, I can assure you that the it was
<br>
not created because of you.  I think many people had similar reaction to
<br>
Luddites around the same time due to Luddite activities.  With our
<br>
cross-pollination of ideas on the list, it is no wonder that many people
<br>
would have similar ideas.  You can be proud that you responded to the
<br>
Luddite threat even before Pro-Act was announced.  You are pro-active
<br>
and not merely following other people's ideas.  But please don't assume
<br>
that Pro-Act was following your ideas or that it was done out of some
<br>
sort of malice.  Unfortunately, I have seen too many of these types of
<br>
organizations and activities fail.  I am pretty sure that you cannot
<br>
blame lack of interest in your projects on ExI.  Instead, I fear the
<br>
real blame is that most transhumanists are too busy or apathetic to do
<br>
much more than read an e-mail list.  Even with the best of intentions,
<br>
organizations have trouble getting paid members, funding, and enough
<br>
volunteer workers.  Almost everybody in the transhumanist movement is
<br>
doing this part time after hours from their day jobs.
<br>
<p>I agree with your frustrations in general if not with your specific
<br>
examples.  I, too, have been ranting about my frustrations with the lack
<br>
of progress of transhumanism in general.  It really does seem that what
<br>
we do is all talk and no action.  I have been questioning how much
<br>
transhumanists are leading or supporting or causing change, and how much
<br>
we are merely a fan club watching the show.  I applaud your work with
<br>
the free state project.  I hope you can accomplish something with it.
<br>
As you know, there are many followers and few leaders.  I predict that
<br>
you will continue to be frustrated at other people's apathy into the
<br>
future.  You will probably work on many great projects that go nowhere
<br>
because other people didn't care enough.  You will run into a lot of
<br>
people who want to join, discuss, and be part of something, but who have
<br>
little time, money or energy for real work.  This is an unfortunate
<br>
state of humanity.  I am beginning to think that human inertia will
<br>
prevent anything unusual or too radical from occurring.
<br>
<p>As someone who also tends to get angry, produce long rants, and vent
<br>
steam at ExI or others every few years, I don't have a lot of advice for
<br>
you.  I can merely say that I recognize exactly what you are saying.  I
<br>
am still here, but I don't know why.  I am still frustrated at a lack of
<br>
progress, but I don't know what else to do instead.  I am still spending
<br>
most of my time in my own company and my own projects, and have little
<br>
energy or money left over to do much more.  I am currently between
<br>
contracts and have been doing a lot of reorganization in my life, my
<br>
business, and my goals.  My own projects and goals are becoming more
<br>
important to me and transhumanist goals are becoming less important to
<br>
me.  Mind you, I still am working toward immortality, better computers,
<br>
future technology, and improving the state of the world.  I just don't
<br>
see this happening through the various groups I joined over a decade
<br>
ago.  Like you, if I want action, I'm going to have to do it myself.  It
<br>
is a sad pattern that I have already noted in previous years.  Those
<br>
people who are really doing things tend to get too busy and they drop
<br>
out of this list.  This list seems to detract rather than add to
<br>
people's real accomplishments.
