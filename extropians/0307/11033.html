</em><br>
<p>I just reread some. Sorry a couple of comma's missing that
<br>
would have helped. This is not the sort of area where my 
<br>
sloppy typing, grammar or punctuation is likely to be helpful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I postulate that I is something; that's my axiom. I exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am, and I am something, therefore something exists.
</em><br>
<p>Seems you are using &quot;I&quot; in the sense of the Cartesian &quot;I&quot;.
<br>
Eg. &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;. 
<br>
<p>At the level of abstraction at which you are operating, &quot;I&quot;
<br>
may not, in fact be a particular thing. In the same way as,
<br>
at the cellular level your &quot;body&quot; is not one thing and your 
<br>
&quot;brain&quot; is not one thing.
<br>
<p>At this level, to say &quot;I&quot; exist, as an axiom is to include an
<br>
unclear term (a term unclear to you and carrying a different
<br>
meaning to others in your axiom) If what you mean by &quot;I&quot;
<br>
is not clear to you then it is not a fact its just a word and
<br>
you do not have a valid (a meaningful) axiom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I've said, I could start from &quot;Something exists&quot;, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't  change the fact the &quot;I exist&quot; would also be axiomatic; 
</em><br>
<p>Although it sounds counter-intuitive, at the level you are talking
<br>
&quot;I&quot; exist is, imo, *not* a fact, it is a statement without meaning
<br>
because you have no clear and distinct notion of what the &quot;I&quot; is. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know it to be true (that's the point of this whole discussion).
</em><br>
<p>Where &quot;it&quot; means ' &quot;I&quot; am ' I think you are mistaken here.
<br>
(NB: I in this sentence is used at different levels of abstraction
<br>
we would probably be better off coining a new term like 
<br>
Iprime to preserve associations but not different contexts.) 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why I bring this up is the following: If there is no &quot;I&quot;, if &quot;I&quot; am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  merely a self-reinforcing, self replicating pattern of information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  what is my driver to prolong the existence of said pattern?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would I want to continue it, or copy it? 
</em><br>
<p>Because at a more fundamental level, a level that is older
<br>
than the evolutionarily acquired trait of consciousnes that 
<br>
gives you the concept of a self and an I, you and your 
<br>
ancestors before you contained a &quot;drive&quot; to survive. The 
<br>
whole conscious thing is an accessory to that. Had your
<br>
ancestors not had that trait you would not be a creature 
<br>
capable of consciousness and self awareness. The drive
<br>
to survive can exist without consciousness but not vice
<br>
versa.
<br>
<p>I think. I am not absolutely certain here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, if there is no self, then why do I care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about life extension, uploading, issues of teleportation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even staying alive one more minute? 
</em><br>
<p>Nature has &quot;programmed&quot; (evolution has selected) you 
<br>
to act to survive and consciousness when it emerges either
<br>
works with the program or is selected against.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is (can be) the point of it, if all I am is bits in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information maelstrom?
</em><br>
<p>There is no externally defined point. The brute fact of your
<br>
existence and consciousness require no point. You have
<br>
the opportunity, or the obligation however, you choose to
<br>
view it to come up with your own point. 
<br>
<p>Your existence preceded any point. You (we) are, as
<br>
Sartre said, &quot;condemned to be free&quot; you (we) must decide
<br>
your own meaning or have none.
