<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0307/12188.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0307/12188.html</a>:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And just who decides and how that this individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violates the Geneva Conventions by acting as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illegal combatant?  The U.S. military?  Without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public trial by jury?  How convenient.  As I said, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights are defined as due process, then we are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly free right now (to follow the law, that is).
</em><br>
<p>a) The Geneva Convention specifies (if you'd care to read them, hint
<br>
hint) that military tribunals judge war crimes, IF the prisoner has
<br>
been incarcerated in a POW camp. The Nuremburg Trials, for example,
<br>
were exactly that. Military officers can summarily execute enemy war
<br>
criminals on site if guards and transportation are not feasible or
<br>
would hamper military movements.
<br>
b) War crimes are so specifically characterized and demand material
<br>
evidence (i.e. actual posession or use of serrated bayonets, or
<br>
chemical weapons, or arrested in civilian clothes, or surrendered while
<br>
hiding behind civilians, etc. etc. etc) that 'who decides', in terms of
<br>
who can bring charges, can be anybody. Anybody can bring a charge of a
<br>
war crime to any officer or military JAG unit or Inspector General, or
<br>
to a civilian politician, or civilian prosecutor, who will forward
<br>
charges to the appropriate authorities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The whole point of Guantanemo is that these people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused of something which carries legal penalties. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That accusation does not constitute a conviction.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter WHO makes it.  That's the whole point of public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trials, juries, due process and the recognition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic human rights, which exist independent of any law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or state.  AFTER they have been convicted by a proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public jury process, with access to counsel, privacy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights to appeal, etc., THEN, if they are duly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convicted, and ONLY THEN can you with any claim of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimacy make the kind of ludicrous Kafkaesque
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims you make below.
</em><br>
<p>Incorrect. While ANY conflict is ongoing, seized enemy combatants,
<br>
legal or illegal in nature, can be held indefinitely. Disposition under
<br>
courts of law is only REQUIRED when a specific conflict has ended, but
<br>
this ONLY applies to LEGAL combatants. 
<br>
<p>The difficulty today is only that al Qaida is not a country, not a
<br>
government, so 'declaring war' is not a possible political action,
<br>
therefore having an end to a specific conflict is quite a vague thing.
<br>
This is an unfortunate fact of any sustained guerilla insurgency, and
<br>
the fact that such movements force governments to infringe on liberties
<br>
is one reason why I am so adamant that illegal combatants should be
<br>
seen as the worst sort of criminal on earth, because they seek to
<br>
destroy the most important bonds of trust that maintain the
<br>
subservience of military to civilian.
<br>
<p>Who decides who is a legal or illegal combatant? On the battlefield,
<br>
officers decide. If a lieutenant of an infantry platoon arrests a man
<br>
with enemy military id who is wearing civilian clothes and has either
<br>
weapons in their posession or their use while in civilian clothes was
<br>
witnessed, that individual can be summarily executed by the officer if
<br>
it is judged that it is not feasible to arrange guards and
<br>
transportation to POW camps.
<br>
<p>Illegal combatants can be interrogated as their captors see fit. Under
<br>
international law, an illegal combatant essentially becomes a
<br>
non-person, because war crimes are supposed to be seen as such heinous
<br>
acts, violating any possible code of personal honor or integrity. This
<br>
is why foreign spies are treated so harshly in many situations when
<br>
caught, if they don't have diplomatic immunity. Infiltrating another
<br>
country without diplomatic status is called in intelligence circles
<br>
&quot;going illegal&quot;. It means if you get caught, you get disavowed and your
<br>
country can't do anything for you, because you are violating the Geneva
<br>
Conventions by doing so.
<br>
<p>Once again, I HIGHLY suggest that people actually study international
<br>
war law before making such unsupported statements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BTW, my understanding is that now all the U.S. state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to do to nail you or me is to make a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declaration that we have de facto, by our actions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given up our U.S. citizenship - and all the &quot;rights&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as they now define &quot;rights&quot;) it entails - by acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a foreign combatant.  Then we could end up down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there too - and we might.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, no. You do get a chance for judges, in some cases a grand jury, to
<br>
decide whether the state's claim is valid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On another related note, I am sorry if I have confused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the discussion of a &quot;free state.&quot;  Originally I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the discussion referred to an existing &quot;state&quot; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S.  However, somewhere along the thread, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective broadened and that's where I came in.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same issues apply however in the narrower context, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any reliance upon &quot;state sovereignty&quot; or &quot;state's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights&quot; might be dampened by reference to the Fed's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions here in California, where they have had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualms about going after medical mariuana users,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite objections from the &quot;state.&quot;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do agree, however, that moving any &quot;state&quot; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general direction of libertarianism would be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, and I am considering what actions I might take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if this project appears likely to actually succeed.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; note that Mary Margarette in Fort Collins, CO, tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this a decade or more ago, and got quite a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarians to move there, but apparently without any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great impact.
</em><br>
<p>Mary got 1000 libertarians to move to Fort Collins, most of whome gave
<br>
up and left within a few years, essentially because the economy was so
<br>
poor and they, being early libertarians (this was the early 70's) were
<br>
even more offensively intolerant of unorthodoxy or differing opinions,
<br>
and unable to work in practical politics due to personal
<br>
predispositions.
<br>
<p>Firstly, she sought too few people. Secondly, libertarians at the time
<br>
were not worn out and ticked off at continued failure of the national
<br>
party to achieve anything. Thirdly, she picked Colorado, which has
<br>
never been a particularly idea location to build liberty. Western
<br>
illusions of liberty are just that. When the feds own your land and the
<br>
state constitution resembles a fascist document, trying to build
<br>
liberty in one community alone is a dumb idea. We've got bigger and
<br>
better ideas than that.
<br>
<p>We are getting 20,000 people, which according to statistics can have a
<br>
measurable impact on any state of less than 1.5 million people. We are
<br>
not interested in an enclave, building bunkers or hiding our heads in
<br>
the sand. We want to win political office, engage in practical
<br>
politics, and not stand on political orthodoxy in every instance.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, in the case of NH, our Republican Governor, who was a
<br>
registered Independent up to a year before the election, is actually a
<br>
libertarian who was the biggest funder of the LPNH. We already have
<br>
four libertarians in the legislature, and the LPNH chairman is on
<br>
Governor Benson's  Government Efficiency Commission. Governor Benson
<br>
wants the FSP membership to move here to NH and is signing up as a
<br>
Friend of the FSP. He specifically said in a private meeting with 20 of
<br>
us that he agrees far more with us than with most of his republican
<br>
colleagues.
<br>
<p>If the FSP votes for NH, the FSP will be simply pushing further along a
<br>
movement that is already well underway here in NH. We already get
<br>
25,000 votes regularly and have 3,000 paying LPNH members. We have the
<br>
highest libertarian population per capita in the country.
