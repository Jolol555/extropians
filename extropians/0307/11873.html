Emlyn makes a number of good points:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert wrote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They don't have to &quot;crash&quot; -- all advanced civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can simply reach the conclusion that there is *no point*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to expansion.  The reason that humans colonize is to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more resources for replication -- once one realizes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; replication (beyond limited forms of self-replication that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which allows one to trump the galactic hazard function) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pointless then one would logically stop doing it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, life itself is essentially pointless, but we keep doing that.
</em><br>
<p>Oops.  Well, he makes a lot of great points later.  The &quot;pointlessness&quot;
<br>
of life depends *entirely* on mood which in turn depends (at the present
<br>
primitive time) on chemicals.  In the words of Philip Dick, the joy knob
<br>
on your mood organ just needs a twist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our human civilisation is the main character in it's own story, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is also the theatre for the competition of ideas. Ideas have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same rules as genes; they need to survive and replicate. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is how you can explain someone sacrificing himself for duty to country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or deciding not to have children but instead to work and become wealthy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but only if this causes his genes in bodies besides his
<br>
own to prosper.  And that would require population to rise,
<br>
not fall.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For instance, a strongly group-oriented collectivist nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [e.g. Sparta] might see the act of colonising the galaxy as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glorifying the state; the sacrifice of the individual may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified [in their eyes] in such circumstances, even to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...Or maybe some civilisation bumps into another civilisation, and is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repulsed by it, or so confused by it, or brought so close to the brink of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinction by it, that the decision is made to spread everywhere, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal of eradicating all alien lifeforms and covering the universe with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable things.
</em><br>
<p>Yes ;-) quite.  I for one much prefer to be among understandable
<br>
things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the bullish times of universal expansion, I think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair to say that many would likely ignore bearish predictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the ultimate resource crunch.
</em><br>
<p>Well said.  &quot;It only takes one&quot;, or a few anyway.  And if
<br>
no one else will, I will gladly colonize the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There seems to be a reasonable argument for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;galactic club&quot; enforcing a &quot;Thou shalt not send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out self-replicating probes&quot; interdiction -- because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any advanced civilization isn't going to want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deal with the problems they create in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We would do it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this doesn't make any sense.  Sending out colonies
<br>
has *always* helped, *never* hindered nations.  As recently
<br>
as the 1600's and 1700's, England on a high enough level
<br>
appears to have had the foresight to get a big country
<br>
going with its own language and ethnic group on an
<br>
underpopulated country so that the big country would
<br>
save the mother country's bacon more than once later on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Question -- if you knew you were likely to survive until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the &quot;end of the universe&quot; with high probability -- would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you actively seek to create future problems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you would eventually have to deal with?
</em><br>
<p>To paraphrase Emlyn, I would probably have fewer problems if I
<br>
were able to make the rest of the universe more &quot;understandable&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For instance, there's always been the question of what an MBrain actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks about. Maybe a civilization/entity/intelligence which can reach such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a state gets concerned about finding a way out of the box (the observable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe). If an MBrain can't work it out, or can get close but not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole way, then turning all of existence into computronium must begin to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks like the positive alternative to a slow, hopeless, lingering death.
</em><br>
<p>I have long predicted that ultimately there will be only
<br>
two things to do:  mathematics and gratification research.
<br>
The latter---it seems to me---also implies generating 
<br>
benefit for one's self as globally as possible, not just
<br>
locally.
<br>
