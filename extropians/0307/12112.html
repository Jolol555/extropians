<p><em>&gt; to capture a thought precisely {and thus is highly recommended}; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>[Lee] Sounds quite sensible.  I especially appreciate your observation
<br>
that one language can *delay* the conclusions that one could or would
<br>
come to, without preventing them.  Even that is quite a concession to
<br>
the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.  While of course it can be harder to convey
<br>
in one language what is easy in another, it surely is about equally
<br>
difficult or easy to *think* certain thoughts.  At least that's what I
<br>
am concluding from this discussion.
<br>
<p>&lt;Me&gt; Actually whats really cool about something like that is the
<br>
function 
<br>
it sets up for comparing the fitness between languages;  that is,
<br>
depending
<br>
on the domain u're discussing, certain languages are better suited than
<br>
others
<br>
for arriving at a particular sequence or arrangement.
<br>
<p>I've picked out a set of languages I wish to learn based on the
<br>
following criteria:
<br>
a) reading material of interest [based on who's publishing what types of
<br>
material]
<br>
b) different mode of thinking &lt;the point we're discussing&gt;
<br>
c) usefulness as it relates to # of people speaking that particular
<br>
language...
<br>
<p>I also believe that language strongly shapes culture; 
<br>
which implies a transitive nature to evaluating *cultures*
<br>
within a domain.  Again for the simple reason that people
<br>
&lt;generally speaking&gt; use what comes to mind first rather
<br>
than examining all their options rationally.
<br>
<p>I'm extremely interested in linguistic structures :)
