I said before that I thought this discussion was bogging down, so I paused 
<br>
for a while.  I think I'll mainly now respond to direct questions left 
<br>
hanging.

</em><br>
<p>The key question here has been your point number 1.  No strong arguments 
<br>
have been offered on it either way so far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;... any particular area or result of which you worry I am ignorant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In economics it goes by the name of &quot;social welfare analysis&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you mean social choice theory?
</em><br>
<p>No, not particularly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I had in mind examples that look much less like deliberate deception.  A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;corporation (or non-profit org) can start out with principles that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;declares, and that the top individuals in it believe it follows, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;market selection pressures can end up making it violate those principles.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This organizational pathology sounds like something entirely separate from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human self-deception, operating through different mechanisms to produce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;results with surface similarity.  If I were analyzing the two systems I 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;dismay.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't seem so different from human self-deception to me.  At it allows 
<br>
us to consider various alternative scenarios and ask what the company 
<br>
&quot;really wants&quot; in such situations.  If you reject the idea that companies 
<br>
want things because they have complex components, you may well not be able 
<br>
to say that our descendants want things, as they may well also have such 
<br>
complex components.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Who says that what *does in fact* make people happier, that is, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical events will in fact put their brains into a state bearing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happiness, is the metric of what they really want right now?
</em><br>
<p>This is one of the two standard metrics used by philosophers and 
<br>
economists, when trying to decide what actions will benefit a person.   Of 
<br>
course being standard doesn't make it right.

</em><br>
<p>Yes.

<p><em>&gt;... Eliezer claims that he can't think of anybody who has been

<p>A lot of people are &quot;shocked, just shocked&quot;, and go through a few cheap 
<br>
motions of concern, but almost all then quickly forget about the issue and 
<br>
go on as before.  Almost no one actually spends much effort trying to shake 
<br>
it off.
