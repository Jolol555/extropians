</em><br>
<p>Right.  I agree completely.  I just resubscribed here after some 18 months
<br>
(IIRC).  The last time I was active here I became rather disillusioned and
<br>
over the last year or so I can honestly say I haven't so much as thought
<br>
about extropy or transhumanism.  I came back for some nostalgia.
<br>
<p>I think part of the problem is that we need to bracket a certain number of
<br>
&quot;ultratechnologies,&quot; the singularities in our equations, these being
<br>
superintelligence, uploading, and drexlerian nanotechnology.  These three
<br>
cast a vast, ominous shadow over any attempt at practical action.  It's
<br>
fairly easy to call them into question: the status of something called
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; that can be Supersized like so many Happy Meals, the myth of
<br>
substrate independence, understating the complexities of system design.
<br>
Extropy is a child of the computer age, so it's little wonder that these
<br>
three embody it so profoundly, and not only through their crippling
<br>
optimism.  &quot;Intelligence,&quot; for example, the idea that computers are
<br>
&quot;reasoning machines,&quot; better than human, more rational.  Moore's Law, a
<br>
fundamental adage of our philosophy and of computer science, despite being a
<br>
marketing technique of a particular company that decided to reduce component
<br>
size and increase speeds, design be damned.  Tape them together and you have
<br>
Supersized Intelligence: superintelligence.  The substrate, another part of
<br>
computer age mythos: abstractionism.  Of course, there's no physical theory
<br>
for uploading, except perhaps, if you might allow, this short, utterly
<br>
erroneous argument: (1) at the quantum level reality is discrete; (2)
<br>
therefore, a quantum computer can simulate any part of reality; (3) the
<br>
brain probably isn't capable of exploiting quantum mechanical effects; (4)
<br>
therefore, a classical computer can simulate a brain that is identical to
<br>
and identifiable with the original.  This, at least, is what I can salvage
<br>
from my side of those copy arguments we used to have.  (I concede.)  And
<br>
finally, we shovel all the real problems under that carpet we call
<br>
&quot;software.&quot;  This is part of that larger Myth of the Computer Age:
<br>
universality.  We can do anything in software, given enough speed.  This is
<br>
not true in any practical or useful sense, however.
<br>
<p>I say the following with complete confidence: there will be no Yudkowskian
<br>
Singularity, the copy is not the original, the creation of the first
<br>
assembler will not cause an immediate revolution in manufacturing.  These
<br>
are science fiction pipedreams.  They're not even very good ones.  Further,
<br>
we need to &quot;deconstruct&quot; our relation to the computer revolution.  We're on
<br>
the other side now, I mean this in complete seriousness, the computer
<br>
revolution is played out.  All that is left is for computers to recede; not
<br>
in the hip, ubiquitous technology &quot;computer in my doorknob&quot; sense but in the
<br>
&quot;everybody stopped caring&quot; sense.  This may mean they'll take different
<br>
shapes.  But that's it, that's your revolution.  Now it's time to look back
<br>
and ask ourselves what was real and what was hype.  A lot of it was hype.
<br>
But that's our origin and we need to pick it apart to understand where we
<br>
came from.  Artificial Intelligence, of the CS kind, of the kind that
<br>
assumes we can design Minds (not brains) through some sort of hokey
<br>
self-reflection, is the sort of hubris we must now only find humour in.
<br>
(Which is not to say computer simulation won't play a big role in the brain
<br>
sciences or any other science, but it's a tool now, nothing more.)
<br>
<p>Even if you bracket the three &quot;ultratechnologies&quot; I mentioned only as a
<br>
thought exercise, it's interesting to see how the horizon changes.  Without
<br>
superintelligence, without the technological Saviour-God, there is no wall
<br>
over which we cannot see.  Without uploading, we're going to die unless we
<br>
fight for it.  Curing aging is only a first (incredibly difficult) step, the
<br>
way we value our lives will have to change, the medical practise will have
<br>
to change.  Nobody wants to live to 400 and slip in the bath, crack their
<br>
head open on the faucet.  It's an entirely different attitude towards death
<br>
and we have to sell it to the world.  Without drexlerian nanontechnology
<br>
(and I speak more of the supposed time frame than the technology itself)
<br>
there is no sudden &quot;fix&quot; for the poor, the starving.  We need to engineer
<br>
crops, educate people, provide clean water.  None of this is going to be
<br>
easy.  We're not going to get off-world soon either, so, yes, we're stuck
<br>
here amidst the war, the famine, those evil fundamentalists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People who complain about our slow progress, question whether things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will work, point out flaws in existing plans, etc., are the real heroes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of tomorrow.  They are the engineers of the future.  People who don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know enough technology to see the flaws, or who are so optimistic that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't see any need to address the flaws, are the people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delaying progress.  Dynamic Optimism was never intended to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith-based position.  We were supposed to be optimistic that everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was possible so that we would continue working toward a solution while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others had long since given up.  Optimism should be an excuse to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harder for the future, not an excuse to sit back and do nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and as well as realising that this stuff requires hard work, we need
<br>
a *critical* approach to technology.  We need to take our heads out of the
<br>
sand, lose the ridiculous &quot;luddite&quot; talk, and realise that, yes, technology
<br>
does effect peoples lives, and that, no, not all technology effects all
<br>
lives in a positive way.  Technophilia doesn't cut it.  Technology is
<br>
ideological in the strongest sense.  The telephone has something to say
<br>
about personal space, personal time, about availability, about distance, it
<br>
embodies certain attitudes towards these things.  Technology is not neutral.
<br>
It meets the world in the form of products or govenment programmes; if
<br>
science has a claim to neutrality, its realisation in technology has long
<br>
since lost it.  And we must always keep in mind that science only makes a
<br>
*claim* to neutrality: universality is the target of science, not its
<br>
immediate achievement.  We can be critical of science, we must be.  We must
<br>
be able to be critical of some research, some applications of science, some
<br>
technologies in order to make a fair argument for others.  To take a
<br>
specific example: with genetically modified foods our fight is to move the
<br>
field of battle from the general, from the sweeping accusation, to the
<br>
specific.  We have to acknowledge that, yes, there are some negative uses
<br>
here.  However, the mistake we don't want to make is the focus on the
<br>
catastrophic.  That's the mistake Foresight made.  Nobody references Drexler
<br>
because he's the grey goo guy.  You can think on whatever timeframe you
<br>
choose, that's your prerogative, but you can only act on a human timeframe.
<br>
What's funny is, a lot of fears could be alleviated if we just admitted how
<br>
difficult this stuff is.  Designer babies?  Not likely!
