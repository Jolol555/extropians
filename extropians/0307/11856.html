NAME: Alex Blainey
<br>
<p>E-Mail: <a href="mailto:Ablainey@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20[GKES]%20figuring%20out%20just%20what%20everyone%20is%20here%20is%20doing%20to%20bring%20on%20a%20bet...">Ablainey@aol.com</a>
<br>
<p>ACTIVITIES
<br>
<p>1) Anthroform robotics research (Upper extremities) with view to eventually 
<br>
producing custom made replacement limbs, also teleoperated limbs with human 
<br>
dexterity and sensory feedback.
<br>
<p>2) Spreading the word about Transhumanism and Extropians to the unsuspecting 
<br>
general populus.
<br>
<p>3) Teaching by example. I have quit the rat race, moved to a better area, 
<br>
Live a healthier lifestyle and show others how they can do the same.
<br>
<p>4) VOTE !!!!!!
<br>
<p>HOW TO HELP
<br>
<p>Regarding 1) Access to MRI, CT or high-res ultrasound equipment would be very 
<br>
helpfull for long term goals. Donations of kit and materials are always very 
<br>
welcome :o)
<br>
<p>Regarding 2) A 'guide to Transhumanism for Dummies' would be a very usefull 
<br>
thing. Many people are put off by the apparent Elitist and heavy 'high tech' 
<br>
emphasis of Transhumanism. Generally they run away from the idea because they 
<br>
think it is just for Boffins and nerds with high IQ's and letters after their 
<br>
name.
<br>
<p>Regarding 3) Get of your Arse and do all that stuff you know you can. Show 
<br>
others that it really isnt that hard to make a difference, Even if it just makes 
<br>
your own life better. This really is the key, people are reluctant to help 
<br>
others, but we all want to help ourselves. So do something to improve your life 
<br>
and then show others how to do the same.
<br>
<p>Alex
<br>
<p>P.S I wish I was at the cutting edge where I could make some major 
<br>
differences. I just hope that the little I am doing contributes to the bigger picture.
