<p>I've spoken with Peter Passaro about this, and apparently the main things 
<br>
are (a) get frozen as soon as possible after death (b) use the new 
<br>
oxygenated cryoprotectants (c) keep the brain from being starved of 
<br>
oxygen.  So people are working on it, and if you get frozen with the 
<br>
latest techniques your chance of survival may still be pretty good.
<br>
<p>One problem I have, though, is that it still looks to me like it would be 
<br>
better to just chop off the head and drop it into a bucket of liquid 
<br>
nitrogen as fast as possible.  *Large*-scale freezing damage is 
<br>
irrelevant; you can still connect the dots easily enough.  What you want 
<br>
to ensure is that the information, the Shannon information, is still 
<br>
there.  I would not be surprised to find even the earliest cryonics 
<br>
patients are resurrectable in toto; it is not necessary that the cells be 
<br>
reparable but that their physical state, when scanned down to the atomic 
<br>
level, contain enough information to extrapolate back the original brain 
<br>
and its relevant high-level information.  The critical parameters here are 
<br>
a matter of information theory, not just medicine, and not at all obvious 
<br>
(i.e., how many initial states map to the same post-freezing state, 
<br>
whether critical information is in global patterns or local patterns, 
<br>
whether information makes a distinction in the final molecular state even 
<br>
if the apparent functional characteristics of the neuron have been destroyed).
<br>
<p>I worry that cryonics has been approached from the viewpoint of medicine 
<br>
rather than information theory.  Here is a point where lack of optimism 
<br>
about post-Singularity capabilities may have killed people - cryonicists 
<br>
thinking &quot;let's keep the neurons as undamaged as possible from the 
<br>
viewpoint of biological function&quot; rather than &quot;let's try and create a 
<br>
physical freezing process such that the configuration space of pre-frozen 
<br>
brains is mapped to the configuration space of molecularly analyzed frozen 
<br>
brains in a way that does not introduce information-loss on the level of 
<br>
relevant functional information&quot;.  These are not at all the same thing; 
<br>
one is concerned not with how much &quot;damage&quot; the freezing process does, 
<br>
from the viewpoint of ice crystal formation and so on, but rather with the 
<br>
question of whether ice crystal formation of just dumping a head into 
<br>
liquid nitrogen is a physical process that maps many initial states into 
<br>
one final molecular-level state to a greater degree than the retraction of 
<br>
axons and dendrites that occurs if you leave the brain without oxygen.
<br>
<p>To give an example of how different the viewpoints are, slicing an area of 
<br>
neural tissue in half and translating one of the pieces by several 
<br>
millimeters is extremely destructive from a biological point of view, yet 
<br>
if the slice is a good one and the translation is consistent, almost no 
<br>
information has been lost - each point in the original configuration space 
<br>
maps to a unique point in the new configuration space.  The question about 
<br>
ice crystal formation is not how much &quot;damage&quot; it does to the neurons, but 
<br>
whether as a physical process it tends to map distinct initial conditions 
<br>
onto distinct outcomes.
<br>
<p>If dendrites and axons retract into the cell body within half an hour 
<br>
after the neuron has been starved of oxygen (!!!), even so the essential 
<br>
information *may* have been preserved; the question is whether scanning 
<br>
the neuron on the *molecular level* would enable you to determine where 
<br>
the original dendrites and axons were, to a degree necessary to reproduce 
<br>
the functional information.  In turn, you can only determine this by 
<br>
running several possible dendritic configurations forward in time under 
<br>
the retraction process, and seeing if several functionally different 
<br>
initial configurations map to exactly the same (molecularly the same) 
<br>
final retracted neuron.  If the mapping is nonunique, however, you're 
<br>
probably toast, unless the gross position of neurons is a constraint 
<br>
sufficient to reconstruct the functionally relevant information of the 
<br>
original circuitry - if there is only one person you could have been such 
<br>
that your neurons would have occupied that gross position.
<br>
<p>What determines this?  The degree to which precise details of the final 
<br>
post-freezing configuration constrain the original circuitry, and the 
<br>
degree to which the constraint is global in nature rather than local, 
<br>
relative to the functional space of brains.  For example, suppose that in 
<br>
some area A1 we have a lossy mapping from a set of neural circuits N1 to 
<br>
the post-freezing brainstate F1.  And suppose that the set of possible 
<br>
initial neural circuits N1 that map to F1 contain possibilities that are 
<br>
functionally different from each other.  Are you dead meat?  Perhaps and 
<br>
perhaps not.  Suppose that there is Shannon information between the 
<br>
pre-freezing states of A1 and A2, such that if we know the pre-freezing 
<br>
state of area A1, it would constrain the permissible states or probability 
<br>
distribution of area A2.  And suppose that, on a local level, there are 
<br>
many different circuits N2 that could have frozen to the final state F2, 
<br>
and some elements of N2 are functionally distinct from one another. 
<br>
However, there's only one possible element of N1 that is compatible with a 
<br>
possible element of N2, and only one possible element of N2 that is 
<br>
compatible with that particular element in N1.  This is an idealized 
<br>
example; you can have probability distributions that constrain and narrow 
<br>
each other without this kind of definite certainty emerging from 
<br>
inspection of a mere two areas.
<br>
<p>The upshot is that if local areas of pre-frozen brains constrain one 
<br>
another (relative to the space of functionally different brains) in a way 
<br>
that survives mapping to frozen brains, such that local areas of frozen 
<br>
brains constrain information globally rather than locally, then even large 
<br>
local blurs may not destroy global preservation of information.  If, 
<br>
however, local areas do not strongly constrain one another, then even a 
<br>
small local blur may permanently destroy your mind-state.  All the locally 
<br>
uncertain probability distributions will modularly add up to an extremely 
<br>
uncertain global probability distribution, rather than many local 
<br>
uncertainties constraining each other to add up to global certainty.  The 
<br>
greater the *locality* of the brain, in other words, the more easily it is 
<br>
destroyed by blurring.
<br>
<p>Blurring may be defined as mapping of functionally distinct local initial 
<br>
conditions to physically identical local final states; or more formally, 
<br>
mapping such that the densest volumes of the probability distribution for 
<br>
the final states tend to overlap one another even for functionally 
<br>
distinct initial conditions.  Whether a given degree of local blurring 
<br>
kills you will depend on the degree to which those functionally distinct 
<br>
local initial conditions permitted by the final local physical state 
<br>
provide Shannon information about each other on a global scale, and 
<br>
whether that Shannon information can constrain the whole brain to a single 
<br>
functional state or whether it only narrows the blur without managing to 
<br>
eliminate it.
<br>
<p>It all boils down to the probability distributions for p(brain|mind) and 
<br>
p(frozen|brain), which together will determine p(mind|frozen).  As usual, 
<br>
your life or death depends on - wait for it - Bayes' Theorem.
<br>
<p>So whether cryonics will work is a question that intersects biology, 
<br>
physics, and information theory, and the properties that determine whether 
<br>
you live or die are not at all obvious if you are thinking 
<br>
anthropomorphically about &quot;preventing (biological) harm to neurons&quot;.  What 
<br>
I worry about is not that cryonics has been misunderstood by the public, 
<br>
but that it has been misunderstood by cryonicists.
