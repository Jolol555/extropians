Dear Natasha,
<br>
<p>I am so sorry to hear of your fight with cancer.  I have seen other people 
<br>
battle with it also so I have some idea, as much as is possible without going 
<br>
through it myself, of how hard and scary that is.   Dealing with cancer truly 
<br>
is &quot;major&quot;.
<br>
<p>But the fact that cancer and other vagaries of our current limits can strike 
<br>
any of us at any time is a very very strong reason that no part of our 
<br>
efforts should be so dependent on one person where at all possible.   
<br>
<p>I don't feel too good about you stating that you are not going to state your 
<br>
plans at this time.  If more of us are not in the loop then how can we 
<br>
contribute?  This seems to be not taking advantage of potential resources and 
<br>
possibly holding on much too tightly and asking people to remain in the dark 
<br>
with just the assurance that things are being done.   That doesn't feel very 
<br>
reasonable.    
<br>
<p>It is quite understandable if a lot else is on your mind and heart heavily at 
<br>
this time.  But please delegate and share where you can. 
<br>
<p><p>- samantha
