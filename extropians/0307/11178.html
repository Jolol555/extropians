<em>&gt; It's true that most people do not know how to save money, and this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very bad for them. However, my questions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   1. when should government print money
</em><br>
<p>When it needs more new money, of course.
<br>
<p>I don't know much about this printing of money business.  I hear it
<br>
devalues the currency ... which might be good if your currency is strong
<br>
and obviously bad if your currency is weak.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   2. when should it reduce taxes *in order to* stimulate growth&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Define where you're measuring &quot;growth&quot; -- that's important.  Raising
<br>
taxes stimulates growth in the government agencies while reducing taxes
<br>
stimulates growth in the private sector.  I presume you're only
<br>
interested in the private sector, so ... I think any time you reduce
<br>
taxes, you are stimulating growth in the private sector.
<br>
<p>Is the tax reduction enough to overcome other forces that may continue
<br>
to depress the economy?  Perhaps not, but if you don't set things in
<br>
motion, you'll never sink any balls.  Doesn't mean every time you set
<br>
things in motion, a ball will be sunk ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, tax cuts really is an alternate form of taxation: instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of people giving their money to the government who then has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; burden of budgeting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;burden&quot;, yeah right  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>There are folks who can't budget a $700-a-week paycheck to adequately
<br>
cover their bills.  How many people do you think have the skills to
<br>
budget billions of dollars?
<br>
<p>(Obviously not most of our politicians, either ...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and distributing it out to government organizations, a tax cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effectively cuts out the government as the middle-man and sends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that money directly back out into the economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A nice generalization, but not always true. What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times that government projects, usually infrastructure, end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up creating wealth in the long run?
</em><br>
<p>Like which?
