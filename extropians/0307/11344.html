<em>&gt; &gt;I agree.  I am sure of this:  there are SOME situations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which our &quot;enlightened&quot; abstract notions of freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;worship of individuality are inappropriate.  There *have*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to be hell-stories of teenagers bent not only on destroying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;their own lives, but the lives of everyone they will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;into contact with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are also stories of adults bent on destroying their own lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the lives of people they come in contact with.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I am aware of such stories.  And for the sake of other
<br>
readers I will state that I think we are talking about non-
<br>
criminal acts here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do the stories about the teenagers differ? Is it that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories about adults are often invented as an excuse for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians to exert control, but the stories about teenagers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are always told by truthful Bayesians?
</em><br>
<p>Why, no.  The stories (or claims) are in many cases the
<br>
same.  The difference is that one can isolate oneself
<br>
from abusive adults, even spouses.  But one cannot get
<br>
away from one's own children.
<br>
<p>To be clear, I do not think that the biographies of
<br>
adults who systematically, yet legally, wreck the lives
<br>
of most people they come into prolonged contact with
<br>
are false.  I wonder why you think that politicians
<br>
would be involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Now [is it evil for me to anticipate objections?], some will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;say that the parents are in no place to judge these intractable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;questions about how the life of their kid is turning out or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will turn out.  But I have two answers.  One is that if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;them, then who?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The kids, as long as they aren't doing things that ought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be considered crimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And if they can't exert control over kids at age 16 then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why permit them to send a kid to his room (depriving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; him of freedom) and restricting his friends and when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he can see them (denying him freedom of association)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't think of a good reason why we should respect any parent who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imprisons kids for actions that the government shouldn't treat as crimes.
</em><br>
<p>Respect is one thing; &quot;permitting&quot; another.  You may or may
<br>
not respect a parent that physically restrains a toddler, for
<br>
example, from various actions, and you may or may not respect
<br>
a parent who keeps a child from leaving the house under certain
<br>
conditions.  That, to me, is not the point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you aware of some argument for permitting it
</em><br>
<p>Here I read this as &quot;permitting a parent to send a child
<br>
to his or her room&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; other than that the means required to prevent it are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes unethical?
</em><br>
<p>I don't see that the state must adopt &quot;unethical&quot; means
<br>
to control the actions that adults take against their
<br>
children.  But I do see such laws (i.e. means) as 
<br>
deleterious to, ultimately, economic and social progress.
