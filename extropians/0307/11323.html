<em>&gt; &gt; want, noble things.  Therefore they do not want to believe that they want,

<em>&gt; &gt; and want to want, ignoble things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please clarify what you believe these &quot;ignoble&quot; things are that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypothesize people &quot;really&quot; want regardless of what they say.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't have specific things in mind, but rather all the things usually
<br>
suggested as what people really want, versus what they say they want.  If
<br>
was going to pick between such things, I'd probably prefer evolutionary
<br>
psychology examples of self-deception about motives.
<br>
<p>For example, people may want sex outside marriage, but not want to be believed
<br>
to want such sex.  People may resent their parents, but want to be thought of
<br>
as loving their parents.  People may want to produce art to gain social 
<br>
approval,
<br>
wealth, mates, etc., but want to be thought of as doing it just for the art.
<br>
People may want to advocate positions that make them seem clever and
<br>
compassionate, and get them social accepted by the right folks, but want to be
<br>
thought of as wanting only to tell the truth.  People may want to be unfair
<br>
when serving as a neutral judge, but want to thought of as fair.  These 
<br>
examples
<br>
should be familiar to everyone; is there anyone here to whom these are &quot;news&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Self-alteration is primarily only at the service of things you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (including things you want to want).  So if people really want to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ignoble, then self-alteration will only make them more so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would you put the supposedly distinct things people want above what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want to want which presumably include their &quot;higher&quot; or less &quot;ignoble&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspirations?   Why would self-modification more likely server what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe is the base reality?
</em><br>
<p>I think you misread me.  I put &quot;want&quot; and &quot;want to want&quot; on the same side, and
<br>
opposed them to &quot;want to believe to want&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, does anyone here believe there are authentic journeys of self-discovery
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and real growth?
</em><br>
<p>I did explicitly posit that there are such real journeys, which Damien said
<br>
have been called &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If so, what distinquishes such from illusory psuedo-growth?
</em><br>
<p>What distinguishes is obvious.  I think you mean to ask how can we tell if we
<br>
are really discovering, or only self-deceived into thinking we are.  That is
<br>
a very hard problem.  I discuss it some in: <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a>.
<br>
There is actually a psych self-deception test you can take, which I have 
<br>
somewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;And those who do struggle over decades to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;the truth about what people want, and who are willing to tell others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; would face largely indifferent or hostile audiences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As seems to be the case with the gruesome experiences of such mystics. Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course what they have to say when they come out the other side filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bliss (which is probably as self-serving and delusory as normalizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; `journey of self-discovery' narratives) also gets a generally hostile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reaction, except among devotees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Again, this seems cynical and self-serving in that it would lead to a notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that real self-growth/self-improvment is impossible so why bother.   Someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who has actually grown is indeed a challenge to others who have not done so.
</em><br>
<p>The notion is not that real self-discovery is impossible, but that it is not
<br>
likely to be socially rewarded, and that it may well not really be what you 
<br>
want.
