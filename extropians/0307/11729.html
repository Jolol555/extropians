<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In some extreme cases I guess it is appropriate to attack someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally, so she or he gets a chance to reevaluate his/her thoughts.
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubert, something tells me you are single.  Seriously, does this
<br>
technique work for you? Perhaps there are certain groups of people with whom
<br>
your technique would work; I am guessing truck drivers, punk groups, drug
<br>
addicts? In my experience, admittedly only with mathematicians, musicians,
<br>
lawyers, physicians, and the like, your technique would be
<br>
counterproductive. First of all, if I read a post of the type you suggest
<br>
(even if not directed at me) then I would conclude that the author is unable
<br>
to make intellectual arguments, has an anger control problem, is prone to
<br>
fits of hysteria, is possibly dangerous in person, and/or  is a jerk.
<br>
Secondly, personal attacks make the reader not like the attacker which makes
<br>
them less likely to care what the attacker has to say and much less likely
<br>
to want to have any philosophies in common with the attacker. Thirdly,
<br>
persons on this list are, for the most part, reachable by appeal to their
<br>
intellect; and your technique is an appeal to their emotion. Irrational,
<br>
emotion driven arguments (which is how personal attacks come across) are a
<br>
poor way of trying to convince others that your view is rational and/or
<br>
superior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whenever it comes to the support of killing people for any cause
</em><br>
whatsoever,
<br>
<em>&gt; except for oself defense I think I even have the obligation for a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you have the obligation, if any, to refrain from personal
<br>
attacks especially in such a situation. If you believe that supporting
<br>
killing for any cause is irrational, then you must present your position
<br>
rationally in order to obtain the best audience from your target. If you act
<br>
with anger toward a person, the person is likely to react to you (and to
<br>
others as proxies for you) in anger and not with the cool-headed, rational,
<br>
serious deliberation that the issue deserves. I believe your approach in
<br>
such a situation would be a detriment to the cause.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubert, I have tried to give you a &quot;chance to reevaluate&quot; your thoughts
<br>
on the matter by an appeal to your intellect. I wonder if it is necessary
<br>
for me to prompt you that this is what I hope you will do by inserting
<br>
personal attacks on you in the way of obscenities.  I don't believe so, even
<br>
though this seems to be what you think is necessary for other people to be
<br>
urged to reevaluate their views. If you need it  though, please insert as
<br>
you read whatever obscenities and personal attacks on yourself that you
<br>
would have put in if you were writing this.
<br>
