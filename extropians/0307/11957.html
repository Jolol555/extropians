<p>
I'm interested in feedback on this line of reasoning:
<br>
<p>Imagine a trait which has a 0.5 heritability.  That is to say that
<br>
there's a 0.5 correlation between the trait and one's genes.
<br>
Specifically, let's use IQ.  Estimates of the genetic component of IQ
<br>
vary, but 0.5 is not an unreasonable number.
<br>
<p>Now let's imagine you wish to bring into this world children with high
<br>
IQs.  Using the DNA of someone known to have a high IQ, you create a
<br>
number of clones.  In this case, let's pick Albert Einstein as the DNA
<br>
donor.  And let's posit that his IQ was 160.
<br>
<p>Alternately, if science has identified every IQ-affecting gene (hah!),
<br>
you may start with any human embryos and modify their IQ-related genes
<br>
to match Einstein's.  
<br>
<p>Here are my suppositions about this thought experiment:
<br>
<p>1) We do not know the relative contribution of genes and environment
<br>
to Einstein's high IQ.  In the absence of such specific knowledge, our
<br>
best choice is to use the statistical contribution of genes and
<br>
environment across the population.  The 0.5 heritability in the
<br>
population would suggest that half of Einstein's deviation from the
<br>
norm in IQ was due to his deviation from typical human genes, and the
<br>
other half was due to environmental effects.
<br>
<p>2) If we created many children who shared Einstein's IQ-related genes
<br>
and raised them in average environments (or a set of environments with
<br>
a distribution mirroring the social average), then we'd expect the
<br>
average IQ of such children to be 130.
<br>
<p>3) The distribution of IQs of these children would form a normal bell
<br>
curve centered on 130.  
<br>
<p>4) The standard deviation of their IQs would be 10 points. (I'm
<br>
particularly interested in feedback on this point.  Would the standard
<br>
deviation remain 10 points given that the genetic contributor to IQ is
<br>
fixed?)
<br>
<p>5) As an extension of point 3, as many of these children would have
<br>
IQs of 100 (dead average) as would have IQs of 160 (Einstein)
<br>
<p>Point 5, to me, is a pretty unexpected conclusion.  But it seems be an
<br>
inevitable consequence of a 0.5 heritability of IQ, and the guess that
<br>
Einstein's deviation from the norm in particular was 50% accounted for
<br>
by genetics and 50% by environment.
<br>
<p>Thoughts?
