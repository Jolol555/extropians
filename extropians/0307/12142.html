<p>
It will certainly be unfortunate if these guys manage to get the market
<br>
shut down.  However my guess is that it will be able to proceed now that
<br>
some of the more provocative imagery and examples have been removed from
<br>
the web site.  People read the articles, and go to the site, and all they
<br>
see is some dry-sounding text, no pics of nuclear missiles arcing out of
<br>
Korea, no Yassar Arafat clutching his chest as an assassin speeds away,
<br>
nothing dramatic.
<br>
<p>So hopefully it can weather the storm.  And in that case, the project
<br>
got more publicity than it could have ever hoped for.
<br>
<p>There is an interesting connection to our ongoing discussion here about
<br>
&quot;Radical Suggestions&quot; and how to think about the unthinkable.  Just as we
<br>
have those here who argue against even abstract consideration of horrific
<br>
suggestions, these Senators seemed to have a similar emotional reaction
<br>
to a market which would deal with objective predictions and responses,
<br>
for events like terrorist actions or acts of war.
<br>
<p>There is something about the mere possibility of a non-emotional response
<br>
which is threatening to this mindset.  My take on it is that there is
<br>
a certain strategy, or perspective, or philosophy, which gives great
<br>
value to emotional response.  This is a widely held philosophical view,
<br>
probably a majority viewpoint, possibly even a very wide majority.
<br>
Sometimes it is combined with a spiritual or religious perspective.
<br>
<p>If we think of this philosophy as a meme-complex, it is in competition
<br>
with an alternative philosophy which reduces the importance of emotional
<br>
reactions relative to abstract intellectual reaasoning.  These two
<br>
points of view are threatening to one another, as each one attacks the
<br>
basic presumptions of the other.  And as memes, both are in competition
<br>
for the hearts and minds (a phrase which itself embodies the two sides)
<br>
of the population, each providing answers and strategies that are almost
<br>
exactly the opposite of the other.
<br>
<p>In his novel Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Robert Pirsig
<br>
dealt with much the same split, between viewpoints he called Classical
<br>
and Romantic.  It's a very old distinction, which he traces back to the
<br>
ancient Greeks.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what lesson we can draw from this, other than to recognize
<br>
the existence of these two points of view, and to try to respect the
<br>
other one even if you don't agree with it.  Of course, my whole analysis
<br>
here is completely in the Classical mode, and will therefore tend to be
<br>
rejected by the Romantics.  It's a tough divide to bridge.
<br>
