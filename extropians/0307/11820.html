<em>&gt; matus, Thu Jul 17, 2003 10:51 am:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There are no doubt a lot of people on this list who know a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;things, and suggesting they are wrong in the face of overwhelming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;evidence is absurd. I would never, for example, suggest Amara's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;descriptions on the formation of dust clouds is incorrect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;historical account and perception of US involvement in the Afghan 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Invasion certainly was, and I presented a clear, calm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precise argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;suggesting as much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matus:  I wish you would have found somebody else with whom to make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your point.  I am not subscribed here and I only read a small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage of the messages. Even when I was able to pay more attention
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; to this list in the past, I'm relatively sure that it was obvious that
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a fundamental disconnect to your worldview,
</em><br>
<p>I note you said specifically 
<br>
<p>&quot;The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. The Afghans fought them with
<br>
little help, surprisingly successively for a large part of that war.
<br>
Please look to Soviet sources or talk to Russians for how difficult of a
<br>
time the Soviets were having. The U.S weapons to the Afghan fighters
<br>
were not until some 7 or 8 years later. We all know how that turned out,
<br>
don't we?&quot;
<br>
<p>I base my worldview as much as possible on empricial evidence, and
<br>
accurate representations of historical events.  You suggested that the
<br>
US waited a '7 or 8' years before supplying 'weapons' in Afghanastan.
<br>
While my 'worldview' may be one you have a fundamental disconnect from,
<br>
your 'worldview' is one that seems to deviate from reality, to suggest
<br>
the US sat idly by and did nothing for 7 or 8 years, is completely
<br>
false.  Perhaps you were referring specifically to weapons, and not
<br>
supplies, but unless you were referring to Stinger missiles, your
<br>
statement is incorrect.  You may have spoken to some Afghan refugees who
<br>
personally did not receive any rifles or Stingers until 7 or 8 years
<br>
into the fighting, but you can not extrapolate from their individual
<br>
statistical sample to the entire Afghan population.  The tremendous
<br>
amoung ot supplies and mules sent in also helped, and to assert the
<br>
Mujahadeen would have won the War without it seems unreasonable.
<br>
<p>I have proposed many times on this list a group effort to form a
<br>
empirical and scientific account of historical events, as unbiased as
<br>
possible.  As I have stated many times, there are so many people of
<br>
different political interpretations that we are sure to get to an
<br>
accurate and reasonable account of what transpired.  No one has ever
<br>
taken me up on the offer, but no problem, its in the works. 
<br>
<p>and I know that I was unable to 
<br>
<em>&gt; communicate my own worldview to you (and the other aggressive and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prolific posters).
</em><br>
<p>I would only ask that you state facts.  Telling me an afghan refugee
<br>
said that no US weapons showed up for 8 years vs. citing official US
<br>
govt documents, supply routes, chinese documents etc... Which evidence
<br>
has more weight?  MaxPlumm chimed in with quotes from 'people who were
<br>
their', although they did not happen to coincide with your worldview.
<br>
<p>There is no doubt the Mujahadeen were brave, hard working, courageous
<br>
fighters.  They were also sadistic in some instances, (as many people in
<br>
a war can be) yet they were fighting the expansion of a murderous
<br>
tryanical regime, and the US helped them.  The vast numbers of stinger
<br>
missiles the US sent made the Soviet helicoptor force completely
<br>
irrelevant, and a significant impact on the invasion in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Usually now I lack  the resources and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation necessary to try to write here.
</em><br>
<p>That is understandable, I personally work some 80 - 100 hours per week,
<br>
and simply because you don't have time to further argue a point does not
<br>
mean you acquiesce said point.  However, don't expect your points, if
<br>
others feel it reasonable to assume are incorrect, to not be challenged.
<br>
<p><p>I would also emplore you not to take it as a personal attack, I may
<br>
disagree with your 'worldview' (i.e. interpretation of historical events
<br>
based on available evidence) but it does not reflect any issue I have
<br>
with you personally.  You seem a bright, intelligent, sincere,
<br>
passionate individual.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I write this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message now much more for the newer people on the list than for you,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since I don't often enter onto the extropians list any more.
</em><br>
<p>Well I write this response for them as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My reason for writing this message is to say that I wish you wouldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be so confidently sure of your facts regarding the topic of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan and other political topics. On that particular message of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan, to which I think you are referring (I didn't read through
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; to the end, it was very long),
</em><br>
<p>I would contend that I am not so confidently sure of my facts.  When
<br>
numerous cites document specific values of aide provided, it seems
<br>
reasonable to assume said aide figure was somewhat accurate.  This begs
<br>
the question of 'what is evidence?'  A web site?  Lots of web sites?
<br>
Official US Govt web sites?  Official Afghan web sites?  Books/web sites
<br>
written by people intimately involed?  Books / web sites written by
<br>
people who spent a lot of time studying said topic?  US Govt official
<br>
documents?  Short of traveling through time, there can always be an
<br>
interpretation of a vast conspiracy to explain away any 'evidence'.  But
<br>
at some point it must be reasonable to draw an interpretation from
<br>
analyzing as many accounts as possible.
<br>
<p>If I were to say the gravitational constant is 6.67x10^-11 and you said
<br>
'prove it'  Do I have to tie some heavy weights up, suspend one by an
<br>
ultra fine thread and measure the torque imparted to said thread, and
<br>
resolve the observations for the G value?  Or can I do a couple web
<br>
searches and present that as evidence?
<br>
<p>I think the old skeptic mantra applies well here, seek evidence in
<br>
proportion to the outrageousness of the claim.  Is it outrageous to
<br>
think the US did actually send $50 million in Aide to afghanastan in
<br>
1982?  Not particularly, and is it outrageous to assume that some
<br>
'weapons' were part of those supplies? Again, I would say not
<br>
particularly.  What are your requirements for evidence?  How would you
<br>
go about 'proving' no weapons were sent (or received)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; my memory of that message was that you presented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information from a number of documents which you found on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Web, and I presented words from a documentary book, and from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghans with whom I have spoken and/or were friends.
</em><br>
<p>And Maxplumm responded with passages from books as well.  Are books
<br>
automatically more valid than web sites?  Or are other issues, such as
<br>
source important to consider as well?  I think it best to analyze as
<br>
many accounts as possible and attempt to discern the real historical
<br>
events as closely as possible from those accounts.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I know 
<br>
<em>&gt; that I lacked patience at the time to write more, and because of my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usual ongoing limitations (lack of time to write, frequent travel, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of access to Internet,  RSI typing hands), I probably did not do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very good job to present my view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one considers that our information sources were vastly different, I
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; don't think one can ever say absolutely you were right, and I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong or vice versa.
</em><br>
<p>But do you concede that there 'IS' a right and a wrong in this question?
<br>
For instance, did the US send weapons only after 7 years after the
<br>
Soviet invasion?  This seems a simple yes or no question.  If you had
<br>
asked the same question of Stinger Missiles, given the investigation I
<br>
did, I would say the answer was no, the US did not.  However, more
<br>
investigation can be emplored if the figures seem reasonably in doubt.
<br>
If more investigation still results in doubt, in more digging can be
<br>
done, this is why I say we should weigh the evidence requirements
<br>
against the extent that the claim is unreasonable.  
<br>
<p>Perhaps my friends or 
<br>
<em>&gt; the documentaries I read were wrong about the sequence of events, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then that would mean that a chain of related events and other people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were wrong too.
</em><br>
<p>Or perhaps there were a lot of people, in different places, who all saw
<br>
/ witnessed different things.  And the only way to gather an accurate
<br>
account of the events was to examine as many as possible?  I don't think
<br>
you should be so confident in your political viewpoints either.
<br>
<p>Well, that's 
<br>
<em>&gt; possible. Or perhaps the duration of time covered in the documentary I
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; read (to 1986) or the places where the writer interviewed people were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different than what was covered for your data.
</em><br>
<p>Quite possible, no doubt there is a lot of data out there on the
<br>
subject.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Or perhaps what was written in official government 
<br>
<em>&gt; documents were never manifested in the real lives of the people living
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; there. Well, that's possible, too.
</em><br>
<p>That's possible, a lot of things are 'possible' though.  Its also
<br>
possible that the fella writing that book was one of the unfortunate
<br>
groups that had supply routes (for instance) cut off or constantly
<br>
attacked causing difficulty in getter US donated aide to him.  But it is
<br>
also possible that the US never sent $1 worth of aide and it's all a
<br>
vast orwellian re-write of history conspiracy.  Both are possible, but
<br>
which is more *probable*
<br>
<p>In the end, 
<br>
<em>&gt; on that topic, I trusted my people sources because, to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct sources of that kind (words from people through which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've already filtered by different means) seemed to be the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most reliable.)
</em><br>
<p>Given the inherient and recognized difficulties and innacuricies in
<br>
first person anecdotes and accounts, I am surprised you give so much
<br>
weight to these accounts.  Before I came to the extropy list, I was
<br>
heavily involved in skepticism, (in fact that's how I first heard of
<br>
EXI) meeting James Randi and Michael Shermer, a member of the NESS,
<br>
loyal subscriber to SKEPTIC and Skeptical Inquirer.  The fallibility of
<br>
the human mind becomes very apparent upon studying this science niche.  
<br>
<p>Does your filter tend to create answers that re-enforece your previously
<br>
held worldview?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I urge you to choose your information sources wisely, and gather your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information from a variety of sources. 'Facts' regarding political and
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; cultural issues can be fuzzier than you think.
</em><br>
<p>Noted in the above consideration, I think we should all attempt to
<br>
choose our sources widely.  I would not, for instance, quote the North
<br>
Vietnamese figures on the numbers of political prisoners.  Nor would I
<br>
accept for fact the resistance claim to the number of north vietnamese
<br>
political prisioners.  I am perfectly aware that historical political
<br>
question are fuzzy, which is why I have multiple times suggested that
<br>
members of this list make a collected effort to create an accurate,
<br>
unbiased (unbiased as possible) account of historical events.  I have
<br>
taken it upon myself to get this project rolling, but with my allready
<br>
<em>&gt;100 hrs /week work reqs. It will be slow coming.  I assure you, my only
</em><br>
goal is a real as possible answers to historical and political
<br>
questions.  I have no interest in preaching to the choir, as I feel it
<br>
is a waste of time / energy / mental CPU cycles, and there is allready
<br>
millions of people out there doing just that.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On gathering data on political and cultural topics -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My own hierarchical scheme for the best ways to gather information on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political and cultural topics is the following, with the heaviest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weighting, starting at number 1), and usually combining a number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources  to reach my own synthesis and/or perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Live in the location of the news.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Note: this is very different from the experience of being a visitor)
</em><br>
<p>I would consider this suspect, considering the overt bias present in
<br>
news in all countries, let alone the totalitarian countries news events
<br>
relevant to our topic typically happen in, its tough to consider this a
<br>
largely reliable source of info.  I don't know if I would count it as
<br>
the most valuable, but this brings into focus the need to weigh
<br>
evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Visit the location of the news.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Talk to the people, who are from that region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Read media in the language of that region.
</em><br>
<p>Again, given that most items of news interest in these historical /
<br>
political questions happen in totalitarian regimes, it seems difficult
<br>
to place *primary* weight on these sources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) Read media from that region translated into English.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6) Read several world media (English).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I basically would disagree with your ranking, I would probably place
<br>
number 6 as a top priority (dropping the english qualifier), behind only
<br>
pure physical evidence (bullet holes, human skulls, etc) I still would
<br>
find it most valuable to read many different news sources, generally
<br>
give more creedence to ones that tend toward freedom of press, but
<br>
remain skeptical when said news source has a direct and important stake
<br>
in the outcome of events, but wiegh all of this with the extent of the
<br>
extraordinary nature of the news report vs. the evidence presented.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The Economist is my favorite source of high-quality, world news, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; printed in English. One reason I like them is that they have some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporters (I don't know how many) who are native, living in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regions from where they gather their news.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I will have to check the economist more frequently.  Recently I have
<br>
been receiving 'The Week' a US publication.  This is one of the best
<br>
sources of Unbiased reporting (I think) I have yet found, I try to find
<br>
overt bias in it, but have difficulty.  It seems they genuinely want to
<br>
actually report only the news of the last two weeks (anyone else had any
<br>
experience with this periodical?)  Its typicall formula is to report a
<br>
news event, the summarize what the columnists and editorials said about
<br>
it (this almost always covers the major converse interpretations of
<br>
implications and such, typically form liberal and conservative writers
<br>
equally)  It also features editorials from many other countries,
<br>
including mid eastern ones, and european ones.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The other newspapers and magazines in English drop steeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me, in terms of reliability, so I tend to read several in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English from different countries, if I want more information, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to get different perspectives.
</em><br>
<p>Why is that?  You have basically presented your list of weights to be
<br>
attatched to a piece of evidence, can you back up your listing as the
<br>
most reasonable?  I would be hard pressed to myself, as it seems this
<br>
would be a difficult undertaking of its own.  But given that, what made
<br>
you arrive at the particular order your list is in?  It would be
<br>
beneficial to figure out the most ideal evidence weight system.  While I
<br>
feel it may be impossible to create a strict formula the results in a
<br>
value of certainy attatched to a piece of evidence, I think a general
<br>
guide would be a good place to start.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... miscellany ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since 1996, I have not owned a T.V.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Good for you, I consider it significantly responsible for our dubming
<br>
down.  I usually have the &quot;nazi's are bad and WWII is the only
<br>
significant historical event ever&quot; (er, I mean history channel) running
<br>
in the background while working, or the discovery or learning channel.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I try to practice healthy skepticism, especially with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regards to what emerges from the mouths of politicians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>As do I!  Perhaps you would be interested in partaking in this effort.
<br>
I value opposing political opinion more than identical ones, as the
<br>
latter can quickly become redundant.  It would require only as much time
<br>
as you are willing to put into it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I try not to weigh anything that I read on the Internet (it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called the Web of Lies for a good reason), until I have found 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sources of information which can  support the writing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or the writer. Of course, I get  lazy sometimes.
</em><br>
<p>Same here (about the getting lazy) which is why I think it also
<br>
reasonable to weigh the required evidence against the extreme nature (or
<br>
lack their of) of the claim.  I think an Afghan citizen claiming *no*
<br>
weapons were sent in from the US until more than 7 years after the
<br>
soviet invasion is far more outrageous (and thus requiring more
<br>
stringent evidence) than claiming the US was sending millions in aide in
<br>
some form almost immediately.
