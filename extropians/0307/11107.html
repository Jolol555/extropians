Damien had written (quoting his crotchety acquaintance on another list)
<br>
<p>&quot;Many Universes: originally/more correctly, Relative State Interpretation
<br>
that fundamentally cannot reproduce the probabilities (Everett introduced
<br>
the artifact that the branching is probabilistic!). Try out the branching
<br>
problem.
<br>
&quot;[This refers to a scientist in each state trying to do experiments to test
<br>
out the predicted probabilities of his QM manyworld. with a state 
<br>
vector that has 2 components with coefficients at psi1*psi1 = 0.9 and the
<br>
second at psi2*psi2 = 0.1. After three experiments, there would be 11 of the
<br>
16 branches in which the scientist(s) would be saying there is less than a
<br>
0.05 chance that this quantum mechanics is correct. With time, the percent
<br>
of universes in which the scientist(s) could still vouch for his(their) QM
<br>
would approach zero. The chance that we could live in a universe that
<br>
accepts QM is zero.]&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not see how the numbers come about.  After three
<br>
experiments, one should have by the Bernoulli distribution:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1       3        3       1
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.9^3    .9^2     .9      1
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1       .1       .1^2    .1^3
<br>
<p>with products respectively
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.729    .3(.81)  .03(.9)  .001
<br>
or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.729    .243     .027     .001 
<br>
<p>and (whew!) these do sum to one. So out of say 37 worlds,
<br>
27 would have got the more probable outcome three times, 9
<br>
would have got two of the more probable and one of the
<br>
less probable, one would have got the less probable twice,
<br>
and a negligible number would have got the less probable
<br>
outcome 3 times.

<p><em>&gt; A simpler approach just occurred to me.  Let's consider a photon which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emitted in a polarized state and encounters a polarizer tilted to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 10% chance of passing.  As Damien describes, if each photon splits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world into two, then the fraction of worlds that see the 10/90
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities becomes vanishingly small.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I would say that sees *three* such is vanishingly small (only
<br>
one in a thousand). But I fear I misunderstand you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But does it really split like this?  In focusing on just the absorption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspect of the experiment, we are ignoring many other quantum mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variables.  That's appropriate for experimental purposes, but not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps, for philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The photon emission itself is a quantum mechanical process.  It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emitted by an excited electron dropping to a lower orbital.  This quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transition is more correctly modeled as a continuous process.  The excited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom emits a constant, steady-state photon wave, and at some point the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wave function collapses when we measure the photon as a particle.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; but not when &quot;we&quot; do something in particular---when it decoheres
<br>
(all on its own).  Yes, I know that this is what you meant, but such
<br>
talk spooks me still.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore even a single emission and polarization-measurement of a photon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not actually split the universe into two parts; it splits it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an infinite number of parts.  Even if it turns out that photon emission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not truly continuous, that it can only happen at multiples of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Planck time or whatever, that's still a truly enormous number of parts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the point is that among this humongous split, 10% of the universes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will see the photon pass through the polarizer, and 90% will see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be absorbed.  Given this reality, a simple counting rule does in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce the Born probabilities.  It was only because we abstracted away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the enormous additional complexity of the world in order to focus on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polarizer interaction that we thought the universe split into two just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two branches.
</em><br>
<p>This seems quite wonderful and simple to me.  Too simple, unfortunately.
<br>
Might you be begging the question here?  That is, people are wondering
<br>
how to go from amplitudes (given by the almighty QM) to probabilities,
<br>
and there is this funny rule: you square the moduli.  The unwashed infidels
<br>
who have rejected our True MWI still point with glee to a missing step here,
<br>
no?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, this is of course just one specific example.  I don't know if it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be generalized, or if we could create quantum systems which literally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have exactly two states, with no additional parameters or dimensions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can fatten things up and give us the Born rules.  But at least I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think this shows that these simple counting arguments are more suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than they seem.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I just don't know what kind of heretical &quot;counting arguments&quot;
<br>
they're guilty of.  Surely it's not so simple as them lumping together
<br>
identical branches in the count as just &quot;one&quot;, failing to take measure
<br>
into account.  What's going on?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
