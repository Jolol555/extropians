<p><em>&gt; But what I still don't get is what's wrong with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'orthodox statistics'. I obtained my p1/(p1+p2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through frequentist thinking, which is supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be anathema to Bayesians. On the SL4 list, Ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goertzel implies that &quot;non-Bayesian probabilists&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are restricted in their choice of priors:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0305/6820.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0305/6820.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... but even if what he says is true, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it reflecting on the subjectivist-vs-frequentist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate. Both sides need priors to get anywhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there's nothing in frequentism to *compel* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of Gaussian priors. So, I still don't get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical lesson.
</em><br>
<p>I can't answer your question, but did you check out problem
<br>
number three on my list?  Apparently Bayesian statisticians
<br>
can solve it whereas those like me trained in classical
<br>
mathematics, do not have enough information.  I'm still in
<br>
shock that not in all instances does P(A &amp; B) = P(A|B)*P(B)
<br>
according to the Bayesians.
<br>
<p>Anyway, problem number three is hopefully my long sought
<br>
Rosetta Stone that does not require talking of distributions
<br>
to see Bayesianism rear its head.  (I do have one smaller
<br>
and much easier problem that lies bare the differences, but
<br>
this here might be much hotter stuff.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. The probability that a newborn will have deformities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    traceable to a sickness of its mother during pregnancy is 1%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    If a child is born healthy and normal, the probability that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 10%.  If a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    child is born with deformities that can be traced to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    sickness of the mother, the probability that the mother had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    rubella during her pregnancy is 50%. What is the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    that a child will be born with deformities if its mother had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    rubella during her pregnancy?
