<em>&gt; &gt; This is a good idea, I often thought the same.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Alex: Regarding 2) A 'guide to Transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for Dummies' would be a very usefull thing. Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  people are put off by the apparent Elitist and heavy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'high tech' emphasis of Transhumanism. Generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  they run away from the idea because they think it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just for Boffins and nerds with high IQ's and letters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; after their name.###
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder who could write such a thing: if you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haunted by doubt and worry regarding our future,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you will likely prefer to answer your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions; if you are not, then I doubt your guide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be worth reading.
</em><br>
<p>Others would respond to this differently I'm sure but
<br>
here's my answer.
<br>
<p>A person could conclude that the principle barriers
<br>
to there achieving an indefinite life span in their life
<br>
time is not that the technological wherewithal is not
<br>
available to their generation in time for them to use
<br>
it but rather that the principle impediment to actualising
<br>
the technologies are political and systemic. They
<br>
arise from the structures of our current societies.
<br>
Societies where the FDA and the need for clinical
<br>
trials put speed limits on the translation of in principle
<br>
solutions into purchasable products. Societies where
<br>
the intellectual property laws relating to patents are
<br>
such that it is incredibly difficult for the various
<br>
potential patent holders of various components of
<br>
an enabling technology to locate each other and
<br>
negotiate control so that the parts of a solution can be
<br>
effectively brought together by somebody.
<br>
<p>Societies where civil rights are under threat because
<br>
clowns in political office are able to manipulate the
<br>
media and sell almost any crock to an unsceptical
<br>
public.
<br>
<p>In Australia recently there was a poll that found that
<br>
roughly one third of Australian's though PM Howard
<br>
had intentionally mislead them in relation to the
<br>
reasons for going to war, another third thought he
<br>
had unintentionally mislead them and yet his overall
<br>
popularity has increased.
<br>
<p>In my view possible the biggest impediment to the
<br>
realisation of indefinite lifespans for people in my
<br>
life time are that voters with no clue are getting the
<br>
governments they deserve.
<br>
<p>So, if the problem is mainly that the voters have no
<br>
clue then producing some more easily digestible
<br>
material (call it propaganda if you wish) to help
<br>
them understand what is going on in the policy
<br>
setting forums of government is in my interest just
<br>
as it is in there.
<br>
<p>Will I write a book titled Transhumanism for
<br>
Dummies. No, I prefer to work with the brighter
<br>
students in the class. I'm more ambitious in the
<br>
change I want to leverage. But I'd be happy to
<br>
chip in with a chapter or two or respond to specific
<br>
requests for assistance from others whom I know
<br>
share my values.
<br>
<p>Would I like to read at some point when I can find
<br>
time chapters on Bayes, written by Eliezer, work
<br>
on AI written by Anders, work on ethics written
<br>
by Greg - absolutely. And these guys *have* gone
<br>
to some trouble to make such papers available,
<br>
but selfish time constrained specimen that I am
<br>
I would still, all things being equal like to be able
<br>
to put my hand on some of these hardy perennials
<br>
of transhumanism, just that little bit easier. This would
<br>
mean that if I wished to discuss these topics with
<br>
others who have done more groundwork I could
<br>
spare them some of the rehashing and also spare
<br>
myself some searching for a good primer. I could
<br>
also point others who I knew to be interested in
<br>
these topics to primers with some confidence that
<br>
what they would find when they went there would
<br>
be quality.
<br>
<p>For me the fact of democracy give rise to a need
<br>
to increase the savvy of the voter because I don't
<br>
see plausible alternatives to democracies coming
<br>
within the timeframes I am interested in.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
