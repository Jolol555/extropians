<p><em>&gt; Let me get this straight.  You're aware that people who are sent [to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tranquility] have committed nothing except resisting being told what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do?  One person was sent here for having the wrong boyfriend.
</em><br>
<p>I must hasten to add, again, that there is a huge diversity of
<br>
cases, and that I am choosing to address only the fraction in
<br>
which were I to understand the situation much more fully, I would
<br>
sympathize with the parents.
<br>
<p>We agree totally in those cases that the parents would be
<br>
unable to get sympathy from family councilors and experienced
<br>
judges of human character.  I hope that you are, as I am,
<br>
entertaining the most extreme cases that you can think of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; How in the hell could she lay there hour after hour, day after day,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without saying, &quot;Just how stupid could it be for me to have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; myself into this situation?  Exactly what was so important that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had to happen?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How in the hell could they punish her with solitary confinement for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'hour after hour, day after day, without saying, &quot;Just how stupid could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it be for[...]' us to kidnap and punish this woman for being someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other than who we, her tormentors, want her to be?  Why would you blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the victim, here, Lee?  Do victims of other crimes also bring it all on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry to repeat---I do grant that you probably acceded to my
<br>
request in the previous paragraph. But the custodians are being
<br>
paid by the parents, so you really mean, 'How stupid could it be
<br>
for the parents...', and I contend that there are cases in which
<br>
what the parents are doing is not unreasonable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Even this article, which was written from the perspective of someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who finds everything about this to be somewhat abhorrent, admitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that in some cases, the resulting people and their parents are quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happy about the eventual outcome.  Deep waters here, IMO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would imagine (though I'm not a psychologist or doctor) that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is equivalent to &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot;.  If you allow the process to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to completion, you get a model serf.  If you rescue the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual halfway through, you get an angry victim who'd love to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; press charges.  In a free society, rescuing these people halfway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through would be a fine business opportunity.
</em><br>
<p>So far, you have restricted yourself to criticizing the actions of
<br>
the parents and their employees, and for that I commend you.  By
<br>
now, most commenters on your side would be proposing that force be
<br>
used to prevent parents from taking these steps.  As I hinted in
<br>
my reply to Eliezer, this induces a great irony: the state may be
<br>
permitted to apply force, but not the parents.
<br>
<p>Yes, it may resemble the Stockholm Syndrome in many ways, and citizens,
<br>
indeed, should always be free of such coercion. Observe my peculiar
<br>
breakdown of the situation:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Entity   External Agent   Ought the EA be permitted to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use force against the E?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Species   another species     N/A
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation    another nation      N/A
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult     State               N
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Child     Parent              Y
<br>
<p>Beware generalizations. Don't embrace principles that would also
<br>
imply that the neighbors can come in and keep you from harming
<br>
yourself for your own good.  Be careful where you draw the lines
<br>
of what an individual is.
<br>
<p>Also, I do not think that you can produce, even considering all of
<br>
history, an example of a functioning society in which children's
<br>
legal rights equaled those of adults.
<br>
<p>Lee
