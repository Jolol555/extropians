<em>&gt; &gt; Neither do a lot of former believers, unfortunately.

<em>&gt; &gt; Cryonics has to advance back up to the point where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we once thought it already was.  We now know more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than we did before, and it doesn't look as rosy as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; once did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harvey, can you expand on this?
</em><br>
<p>We have a lot better imaging technology now, and pictures of patients'
<br>
brains who have been frozen.  The damage is a lot worse than we thought.
<br>
The cells shrank and pulled apart from each other with gaps between them.
<br>
Where the cells stayed put, they are disconnected from other cells.  Where
<br>
the cells stayed connected, they are all pulled together leaving huge gaps.
<br>
The structure and positional relationship between the cells may or may not
<br>
be recoverable.  Some people have likened this result to &quot;hamburger&quot;, under
<br>
the analogy that resurrecting a brain in that condition would be like
<br>
resurrecting a cow from hamburger.
<br>
<p>I am still signed up for cryonics, but it seems to be to be a very low
<br>
probability chance of success, barely better than nothing.  Many people
<br>
don't even bother to sign up for this reason.  I certainly hope that better
<br>
methods can reduce this situation before my time comes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When do you think cryonics was at it's high point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in plausibility and why do you think it is lower now?
</em><br>
<p>Before the imaging we thought a frozen brain looked pretty much like a
<br>
brain.  We assumed that future technology could fix it, or maybe nanotech,
<br>
or maybe we could just scan the structure and build a new brain.  Now after
<br>
we have a better picture of what is going on inside and at the cellular
<br>
level, the picture literally looks worse than we expected.  That is why I
<br>
consider cryonics to be lower in plausibility now than in earlier years.  We
<br>
have more information, and the newer information isn't good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I was to make one overriding criticism of the transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement it would be that there is entirely too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;believing&quot; going on and too little structured critical thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where assumptions are made explicit and are themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open to constructive criticism. We, this generation, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist that I'd hoped would know better, seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in serious danger of &quot;believing&quot; (as opposed to critical thinking)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another couple of generations to death.
</em><br>
<p>This is what drives me crazy.  So many people are quoting slogans or going
<br>
on &quot;faith&quot; in science and technology.  Science and technology aren't
<br>
supposed to based on &quot;faith&quot;.  It is so rampant that I believe that MOST of
<br>
the claims and predictions we hear today in the movement are over-hyped and
<br>
predicted to occur much sooner than they will.  This is NOT to say that I
<br>
don't believe in this stuff any more.  But it isn't here yet.  Somebody is
<br>
going to have to actually learn the technology and work on this stuff for a
<br>
few decades to bring about the stuff we are talking about.  The pop-culture
<br>
level of discussion we usually see just is out of touch with reality.

<p>I can't get to either of those pages, but I do applaud any real scientific
<br>
work being done.  I don't mind popularizing and discussion either.  Let's
<br>
just get it right.  Hype, over-selling and misinformation won't help our
<br>
cause.
