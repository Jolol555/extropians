<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Human nature being what it is not all the recommendations for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; employee cuts will be motivated by the higher good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; With almost superhuman effort, I refrain from the requisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sarcastic comment here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You lost me Lee. Where are you going?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry Brett.  The requisite sarcastic comment would be
<br>
&quot;Oh really?  Are you telling me that some of the employee
<br>
cuts might be for base motives?  Surely you cannot be
<br>
serious!&quot;, or similar words to convey my cynicism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some will want to settle old scores, remove competitors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; use the opportunities in the restructure to alter their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; competitive position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Say it's not so!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (After all, I'm only human.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In some cases it *is* so. (Double sarcasm if you like ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Well, DUH, of COURSE it's so! 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *You* asked the question!? What gives?
</em><br>
<p>It was a rhetorical question---that is, when I said
<br>
&quot;what possible incentive would government (or government
<br>
employees, etc.) ever have to cut spending?&quot;, I was just
<br>
saying that they do not have incentives to cut spending.
<br>
I am sorry that you took it so literally; that is not how
<br>
it was meant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well I'm not quite that cynical. People's positive views of themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are something they sometimes want to retain too.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, but see Robin's recent comments on &quot;views&quot; of 
<br>
a person.  People also will want positive views of themselves
<br>
too, but often foment the most amazingly self-delusional beliefs
<br>
to do so.
<br>
<p>Oops, sorry, I know what you think about &quot;beliefs&quot;, but it
<br>
is late and I am too tired to reword that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There probably is such a thing as someone wanting to do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real public service all things being equal. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway I thought *you* were the one that believed in altruism. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the kind of altruism that we are evolved for
<br>
is not at all related to the kind of decisions bureaucrats
<br>
make.  We are evolved to feel sympathy for individual other
<br>
people.
