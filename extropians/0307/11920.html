<em>&gt; &gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hahahahaha :) I doubt things are resolved to ur 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfaction on a regular basis, insofar as people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would feel the need to reach for the &quot;ambiguity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the middle ground&quot; are rarely capable (emotionally)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to offer such a clear statement of  intent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Brett] You've got me pegged pretty right. But peoples 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *actions* are often less ambiguous than their words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the absence of a clear statement of intent I can deem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one to have been made on their behalf. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: You can always infer, but are your correct in ur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference?
</em><br>
<p>Not always. But I am always correct in being aware that 
<br>
I have no choice but to act on matters involving other 
<br>
people, their judgements and their motives, their views
<br>
on the basis of incomplete information. This means I can
<br>
act without forming something so sloppy as a &quot;belief&quot;. I
<br>
have a working hypothesis which I test to the extent that
<br>
I need to OR to the extent that time and my other priorities
<br>
permit. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I am at quite at home giving the boot (nothing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse than a scratch u can't itch), I don't like giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people the boot erroneously.  Practically speaking, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means I give them the benefit of the doubt.
</em><br>
<p>Me either. Practically speaking I give them the benefit of
<br>
the doubt *usually* but not always. Sometimes things
<br>
need to get done, if one is operating entrepreneurially 
<br>
or towards some important goal or object, and it doesn't
<br>
matter who does them so much as it matters that they get
<br>
done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: Eg.  A drunk driver is no less dangerous for meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no harm and from me would probably get little mercy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite quite a lot of understanding. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: in other words, u judge not only by intention, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by effect :)  I do the same thing, but for a while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; {17-23} it was an outstanding question in my mind;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or put another way, how hard{line} a game do u play? :)
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the circumstances. Eg. How high are the 
<br>
stakes to you in the particular social exchange? Further,
<br>
are you engaged on a task that is vital and time critical, in
<br>
which case their is little room for being soft and the hard
<br>
line is necessary; or are you just hanging about, chewing
<br>
the fat or talking or acting so as to be sociable, to satisfy
<br>
a human yearning. In the latter case I cut a lot of slack but
<br>
I pick my company beforehand.
<br>
<p>In the drunk driver scenario, where I imagine my life
<br>
or the lives of some that I care about are imperilled by
<br>
some homo-turkeyius a very hard line is taken because
<br>
time does not permit me to adopt a universal perspective
<br>
without losing something of very high local value - ie. me
<br>
or other subjective individuals I value.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;... and the great fear that stops a lesser mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  from becoming a greater mind is the fear of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh I'd agree with that statement insofar as it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; limiting factor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for  attempting new directions;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Hell, more than that its a limiting factor in learning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Most of us live lives surrounded by sources of good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information and people who will as happily help us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and return one good turn for another as not. Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one builds up some credibility and a stock of skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contacts and a knowledge base to trade even the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trade gets to be informal and people with win/win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attitudes to mutual empowerment tend to seek 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; each other out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thats also limited though by ur access to such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people, and what they have to offer in trade (versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what you are offering and their needs).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:As I've gotten older (I'm now 36) I've found that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting access to what some would regard as influential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people is often surprisingly easy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Depends on what u mean by influential :) Besides,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not interested in meeting (necessarily) influential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people; just brilliant (and focused) ones :)  [who may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be influential] :)
</em><br>
<p>That's pretty much what I meant by influential. They can
<br>
assist me in influencing a desired outcome. They may or
<br>
may not be regarded as influential by society generally.
<br>
Often they are though, as often to move with leverage
<br>
you need to tap into the networks of others who can
<br>
themselves move with leverage and so on.
<br>
<p>To give one example. Back in Oz last year national 
<br>
stem cell legislation was being enacted. I wanted to see
<br>
the most liberal possible legislation come into place.
<br>
The people I leveraged with were stem cell CEO's,
<br>
patient advocacy leaders, politicians (or more often 
<br>
their speech writers or advisers), journalists, and the
<br>
heads of biotech and medical research industry
<br>
associations. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have run {acting as one of those people who is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skilled in several areas within my extended family}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into several roadblocks; the largest being the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in experience levels between my own level, and that of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; several cousins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and other associated ilk, despite being of similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chronological age.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The reality of the situation is that without a bloodline 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (regardless of time in shared common experiences), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would probably not have bothered, since they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing notable [to] trade. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: Yep. I get what your saying. Sometimes perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for family or perhaps because ones sees someone be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generous to others or perhaps just because the simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  humanity of the other is enough to build a bridge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between you - you give them trade credit. Latter maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they repay you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: ... or u may just be particularly bored :) 
</em><br>
<p>I'm rarely bored. I spend a lot of time analysing. That is 
<br>
something I *have* to do on my own, but I can run it as
<br>
a background job and sometimes I need to. When I'm
<br>
running the background job I've sometimes got time and
<br>
the inclination to run with stuff that interests other people.
<br>
And in the end I'm social. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm free with information/expertise, insofar as the request
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that information is made in such a manner as to evince:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) some effort to solve the problem (independance)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) some [stalled] effort to analyze why their solution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Generally I don't like dealing with stupid [or lazy] people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who invariably (despite their best efforts) suck up my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time needlessly. Or put another way, people who aren't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be able a) comprehend the answer (or subtleties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contained therein) or b)perform the solution.  That cuts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out alot of the traif :)
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you and I better both fill out a GKES description
<br>
(other thread) or start to describe more clearly what we do
<br>
lest we be in danger of wasting our time then ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the most sophisticated of them required (practically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speaking), approx 3 years to even begin to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an outlook that will eventually lead to a good set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offerings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: I think everyone has something to trade, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchanges are not always equal ones, and when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other tries to bullshit you the trade should be terminated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with extreme prejudice. And sometimes you just have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say sorry can't help today or this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They wish I was that gentle :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Generally I'm pretty much the last resort :) :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll fix their problem, but they'll get a running lecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the size of NY pointing out all the flaws in their current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mode of thinking :)  The particularly intelligent ones shut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up and listen; the stupid ones invariably attempt to offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;insert stupid excuse&gt;, ergo in one ear, out the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those I don't bother dealing with anymore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to everything having something to trade, well, yes :) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thats why the invented the term cannon fodder :P 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;ok, just kidding&gt;.  I can't say that for me personally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody has something to trade.... But i suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats more of a failure on my part to be interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in everyday things that seems to consume a majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their lives.
</em><br>
<p>I see your point and there is no real disagreement here
<br>
I suspect though I am wondering what you do as a day
<br>
job. In ideas as in currency there is small and large
<br>
change. People who want simple things from one (and 
<br>
are willing to trade) can usually be referred to others. 
<br>
The trades aren't all of equal value, nor do they need
<br>
to be two party only.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;The fear of *looking* stupid might very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cost people their lives in coming decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ignorance and stupidity are not the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We all start ignorant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to think we all remain ignorant [given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sheer volume of  information and possibilities];
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; some of us just manage to migrate to (slightly)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lesser degrees of ignorance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see in this what I consider to be a [S]ocrat[ic] fallacy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; i.e., the notion that as nothing can really be known the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person who thinks they know nothing is actually wisest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh I wouldn't go so far;  I am merely pointing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out [that] to pin down any particular statement as a fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you generally have to limit the domain in which u are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussing; and that given true mastery of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment {which is at least, my goal} cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had given the limitation just expressed, ergo we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never be able to completely remove from ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a state of ignorance {given the expansion of the domain}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or as David Bowie said in one of his songs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that @ a certain point in development {of say, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology), I don't prefer knowledge, just certainty :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: Seems I misunderstood you. Sorry. Am I right to infer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you'd agree that even within even a complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain where certainty is not possible that you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still prefer and pursue means to reduce the extent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the uncertainty, to reduce your ignorance as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible. I could be off on a tangent here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Certes :) You are correct;  I would add only one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualification... That I do not pursue all available portions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of knowledge.... I follow a demand-based algorithm for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquisition of expertise.
</em><br>
<p>But whence comes the demand? From you or from others?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are social to an extent, (it is not sensible or useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or healthy for us to personally doubt this), we are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable to an extent ( again let Socrates or the neo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Socratics take a shot at that as a fallacy). Once we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we are social and we are ration[al] we know some things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that are useful to us, to our happiness and our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development. We learn that we have freedoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but that we remain free within bounds. We cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violate the contingent nature of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but that leaves [one] in a continual state of ignorance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does it not?  There *is* no final point of enlightment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where we mystically shed our ignorance and reach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an enlightended state :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ignorance about some things yes. But not ignorance [of]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all things. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: if you're ignorant of something, and knowledgeable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about everything else, you're still ignorant :) 
</em><br>
<p>Yeah but ignorance is now being used multidimensionally.
<br>
There would be little utility in describing Bertrand Russell
<br>
as ignorant simply because he elected not to learn sanscrit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more knowledgeable (in comparison) to someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else, but ur still ignorant :) Its ok to be ignorant of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something; it is not ok to stay ignorant because you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love to be ignorant :) 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Or at least such a choice carries consequences
<br>
and one will be delt with as an object rather than a 
<br>
subject and fairly so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ergo my previous statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of simply being able to reach lesser degrees of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ignorance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: Wow. Perhaps we have come in a circle or were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at cross purposes because now I am agreeing with you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ignorance is a matter of degree. (But there are some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainties). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder if you are agreeing with me that there are some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elemental truths (some certainties) more fundamental than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science and less social than proof of which we are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant. Indeed they form the foundation of what we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build on top of them. Or rather we build outward from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our subjective centre.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:  I dunno, I have it cast in a different image;
</em><br>
<p>Then I think you are not and I've so far failed to
<br>
communicate a potentially important point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think there is an objective reality, and that knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it can be obtained; 
</em><br>
<p>One all-encompassing meta-domain? I agree but in
<br>
paraphrasing I take pause. Ultimately I accept it as working
<br>
hypothesis in which I have a lot of confidence. (Translation:
<br>
I &quot;believe&quot; this for the time being but not unreservedly)
<br>
<p>Knowledge of *part* of it (objective reality) can be 
<br>
obtained. But *not* all of it. And scientists try to understand 
<br>
as large a part of it as they are able.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also hold there is a notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective objectivity, - [that] the[re] are truths contained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in [ones] particular pecerptual filters, as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the effects (artifacts) of [ones] perceptual distortions.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed largely. But truth is not so much &quot;contained&quot; in
<br>
perceptual filters but perceived in part by subjective
<br>
filters. One has *no* objective filters. The eye does not
<br>
produce vision it receives light in a certain range of 
<br>
wavelengths (so much is trivially objective) but seeing is
<br>
not objective but subjective as the brain adds interpretation
<br>
and context sometimes incorrectly. 
<br>
.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Generally I would say yes, at the beginning, u build out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from ur subjectively perceived notions of realities...
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; But I think u can fundamentally characterize both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truths as they relate to your subjective viewpoints,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and by removing those truths (or inversing the function),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve the objective reality that stimulates ur perceptions.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;truths&quot; is becoming a slippery word now.
<br>
<p>Can you paraphrase yourself as I am not following you?
<br>
<p>I doubt your conclusion if it is that you achieve objective
<br>
reality in any non subjective sense. One exists as a brute 
<br>
objective fact, but thats hardly an achievement. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip abstact reasoning etc as separate cases&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My point, ignorance is a natural starting postion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is not something to be *ashamed* of, but nor is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in itself a positive virtue. Socrates was wrong. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wisest man is not the man who knows he knows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing. Imo :-)  A wiser man knows that he is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational and social and that he will find health and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfaction and good relations at least potentially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with other men (or women) if he proceeds on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; basis of these truths that present themselves to him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on a level even  more fundamental than  scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; truths. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I wouldn't go so far as to agree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regarding ur point on Socrates;  I think we simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; differ in our intrepratations :)  You seem to imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Socrates was saying ignorance is a blessed state;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: That was not my intent. I think Socrates was trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to disclose hypocr[i]sy and false knowledge and his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method works well to a point. But it works in dialectic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The monologue of the subjective and some truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are untouchable by Socrates. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Aaaah I see what u're getting at.  You're saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without a comparison to judge [one's] ignorance against,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mans natural inclination should (or would) be to attempt to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand his own nature....
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But its would not should. And my intention is that that
<br>
be a starting point to deeper insight not an insight in itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whereas I think that Socrates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was stating a simple truth; that no matter how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge you accumulate, there is still so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more to learn, and past that, too many probabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to deal with.  He wasn't explicitly giving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comparison function; merely observing that anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with half a brain will also have hit a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conclusion.... which of course, implies a test of sorts.... Of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the game can get deeper from there :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am I think only partly getting your meaning now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me try another take. 1 and 1 make 2. This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a truth open to any inquiring rational mind. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words may be changed but the referents don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A person may not be a mathematical genius but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still be sure that one and one make two. The rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the mathematical domain can be built on top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that (not by all of us and not completely) so to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some extent all of [us] remain ignorant of mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we make ignorance or non ignorance of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics the issue. [if we express it as a binary] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we have to answer truthfully to ourselves do I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand all mathematics yes or no or am I ignorant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the domain as an entirety (but not elements of it)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then yes, one can be ignorant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: bing :)  The only time you can consider urself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-ignorant is by limiting the domain u are considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and knowing everything about it :)
</em><br>
<p>To take such a tack is to perceive ignorance as an
<br>
all or nothing phenomenon [as binary, there or not there]
<br>
not as a matter of degree. This lacks utility and renders
<br>
the concept of ignorance virtually useless when applied
<br>
to the domain of all-knowledge as no-one can be anything
<br>
but ignorant in the binary sense as no-one can know all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do comparisons between states of ignorance within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the context of a particular evaluation function :)
</em><br>
<p>I think your saying what I'm saying now with different
<br>
words. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: But in practical terms we take on the subject matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in complex domains in increments. We model reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't perceive the whole shebang in one hit. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can reduce ones ignorance of the whole shebang
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by degrees. But not remove ignorance of all entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Reductionism may not necessarily give you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire picture, IMHO.
</em><br>
<p>It *cannot*. Goedel incompleteness theorum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider that the symbols
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are using to identify semantic notions are defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by their very relationship to each other...  In that sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your vocabulary is defined holistically.  Whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not ur semantics can be encapsulated by examining each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate relationship between each of the concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not gauranteed.  The tapestry may be more complicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than that (and probably is).  I do agree that more insight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can (statistically speaking) usually be derived, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally I think it will require a holistic viewpoint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to gel it all together.  
</em><br>
<p>There can be no &quot;getting of it all together&quot; in any social 
<br>
transmissable way. We can prove things to each other
<br>
only if we accept the concept of proof. There are some
<br>
things which are truth but which cannot be proven.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  and BTW - just because you achieve a lesser state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of ignorance does not mean u neccesarily are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; competent that someone else in the grand scheme of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things; I, for instance, though quite skilled in several areas, would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not care to go head to head with a peasant in the area concerning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; growing things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: True. There are different domains of knowledge that each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or us can pursue. But importantly imo there are some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domains of knowledge that all of us MUST pursue or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in a state of bad faith [poor &quot;health&quot;] with ourselves. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Well :) That would depend entirely on the utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you derive from lacking that PARTICULAR piece of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance :)
</em><br>
<p>Is your contention *fully* preserved if I paraphase the
<br>
above thus? &quot;That would depend entirely on the utility of a 
<br>
particular piece of knowledge&quot;.
<br>
<p>Because I am arguing something further. I am arguing 
<br>
that there are some domains of knowledge that cannot
<br>
not be of interest whilst one is alive and sentient.
<br>
<p>The distinction between one and you (the loose colloquial
<br>
term) matters for my argument it may not for yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Now outside forces, can intrude upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and mess with ur utility functions, but only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insofar as you value the benefits they offer.
</em><br>
<p>Outside forces can kill one and totally fuck *all*
<br>
ones utility functions permanently. 
<br>
<p>But they cannot kill *you*. In the sense that
<br>
&quot;where death is *you* are not, where *you* are
<br>
death is not&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thats the link between perception and expectation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; btw :)
</em><br>
<p>Lost me? I think were at different levels of abstraction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: And this is that we must each perceive the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the centre of  a subjective universe and that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start doing so with a propensity for sociability and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity for rationality and these two together gives us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language which enable us to approach to varing degrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subjective universe of the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Yes but what if you have no sense of self?  You're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left with a case where there is no impetus :) 
</em><br>
<p>This is nonsense:-) I cannot in any real way have no sense
<br>
of self. So I cannot be in a place without impetus. I can of 
<br>
course use a different word for self or conceptualise my 
<br>
consciousness to myself in different ways. But whilst I live
<br>
I will have impetus. That is brute fact for me. I presume
<br>
it is for others too.
<br>
<p>I think that you are jumping in an out of your own frame
<br>
of reference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a very real case for human beings :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just go ask all the lobotomized people :) or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schizophrenics and the like...  You're trying to extrapolate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ur viewpoint out to encompass all human beings; 
</em><br>
<p>I am indeed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm saying that more important than all of that is the utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; derived from going from a state of ignorance to a state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; {less} ignorance... If there is no utility, then there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference. 
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the standpoint. If you (Paul) think there is no
<br>
difference because you (Paul) see no utility then there may
<br>
be no difference for you. But for me an observer of you 
<br>
I will make comparisons of your states of ignorance in
<br>
different dimensions using a standard of utility for me, not
<br>
for you.
<br>
<p>For example, if I am trying to teach you something because
<br>
I want an ally and to propagate some memes then I will
<br>
care about whether your relative level of ignorance and
<br>
to what extent it is changing within the domain I am trying
<br>
to teach you. But if you don't give a shit about what I
<br>
am trying to teach you, because you see no utility in it,
<br>
you will not bother to learn. Now it could be that what I
<br>
am trying to teach you is how to swim when we are on
<br>
a sinking boat with insufficent lifeboats and you are 
<br>
unaware of it. In such a scenario when the boat sinks
<br>
and you can't swim whatever yoy thought of the value
<br>
of the swimming lessons will be mute. But you will
<br>
not be ignorant anymore. You will not be you. You
<br>
will be dead. You will be in Monty Python terms 
<br>
an ex-Parrot.
<br>
<p>Of course we are all wrestling to teach and learn things
<br>
from each other and all backing our own judgement
<br>
on what are the more and less worthwhile things to 
<br>
learn.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is btw, the main reason why I (practically-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking), feel completely at home ignoring entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies of work; there is no utility  :)
</em><br>
<p>Your probably right. I do the same. But possibly
<br>
both or one of us could be failing to learn to swim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because the information is present doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean there is some  inherent burning need to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out and consume it :)  
</em><br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're arguing .... that the capacity for reason and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the propensity for sociability are two givens; I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree, in that the capacity for reason may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deficient (or absent), and the same for sociability....
</em><br>
<p>Not completely, not in what *I* would regard as a
<br>
subjective sentient other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   In other words, [particular]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge is not an instant path to success :) The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fitness of ur function depends heavily on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment in which you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; competing.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: Agreed. A nuclear physicist that can't swim across out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a river when his boat sinks has in a way wasted some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his time learning excess knowledge in one domain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not enough in another - swimming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I come back to my central point. All of have some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domains in common. We all start from the subjective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centre, we all are social, we all are rational, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we all value our lives. Our lives are the first value to us. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: See, in this starting assumption (social, rational, value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life) we differ :)  Although a majority of people may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ostensibly have those qualities in some degree, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone does :) Now if you would like to limit ur 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements to the subset of people who do have those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities.... :) 
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm. In practice I think I limit my deeming of personhood
<br>
to those who do have those qualities. And those who are
<br>
not persons I would regard as objects not subjects deserving
<br>
of no rights in the social compact. They may be someones
<br>
elses possession. Like someone elses pet or domestic 
<br>
animal. However even pets and domestic animals would
<br>
normally score a rating on my assessment of sociability and
<br>
rationality its just that they have not so far crossed the
<br>
threshold to be deemed persons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You: And perhaps we can use these universals in domain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to good effect. Perhaps we can ground a more rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics. But I digress as well as rant :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: I think u will be dissappointed; the utilities (short of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced death) are not there.
</em><br>
<p>I may be disappointed in my attempts to formulate my
<br>
notions into a consistent ethical system and to communicate
<br>
them but I will not be disappointed in deriving for myself
<br>
an ethical system that I at least will use and that will have
<br>
utility for me in shaping my judgements. 
<br>
<p>But I am pretty ambitious and I see ethical systems as
<br>
important to engendering wide cooperation so I will
<br>
probably persist from time to time with trying to ground
<br>
one and to communicate it to others.
<br>
<p>Forced death is the given. Forced death is the current 
<br>
default human condition. What I am about is looking to 
<br>
change that for persons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   But even death is not enough it seems [given the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of people that have come before us and died]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .....
</em><br>
<p>For them it was too early. I can forgive almost anyone 
<br>
almost anything given they are dead and given they lived
<br>
in a more primitive world and in the earlier circumstances
<br>
that they did. But then I wasn't there then so my forgiveness
<br>
is hardly magnanimous as I was hardly directly harmed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And as u said earlier, the limiting factor is often a fear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of appearing stupid or foolish.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
