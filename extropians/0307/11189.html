<p>
You have a good point. I would not say that cryonics is lower in
<br>
plausibility now than in earlier years, rather that we have now a better
<br>
understanding of the difficulties involved, so that realistic estimates of
<br>
when cryonics patients may be revived have to be set later in the future. At
<br>
the same time we have demonstration that cryopreservation is feasible for
<br>
some biological systems (tissue, embyios, unicellular life), so it seems a
<br>
reasonable assumption that it can also be done for a living brain, even if
<br>
this is far more complex technically. The information IS there, encoded,
<br>
perhaps just reading the information in a frozen brain (look at the recent
<br>
advances in high res brain mapping, there is an article on betterhumans),
<br>
may be feasible before restoring the same frozen brain to biological life.
<br>
I would say the same kind of things for the other examples. Cancer is
<br>
another good example, when I was a kid we thought that cancer would have
<br>
been defeated by year 2000. It has not been the case, but now we know much
<br>
more on the biology of cancer. The current knowledge permits realizing that
<br>
curing cancer is a very difficult thing, much more difficult than we
<br>
thought, but it also permits devising new schemes that, I believe, will
<br>
work.
<br>
Knowledge is always good even if it can be frustrating, at times more
<br>
knowledge forces you to realize that an objective is not so close.
<br>
Back to cryonics, I still intend to sign up and lets see what happens. Life
<br>
has always been a risky business.

<p>###Harvey: Before the imaging we thought a frozen brain looked pretty much
<br>
like a
<br>
brain.  We assumed that future technology could fix it, or maybe nanotech,
<br>
or maybe we could just scan the structure and build a new brain.  Now after
<br>
we have a better picture of what is going on inside and at the cellular
<br>
level, the picture literally looks worse than we expected.  That is why I
<br>
consider cryonics to be lower in plausibility now than in earlier years.
<br>
Wehave more information, and the newer information isn't good...
<br>
<p>This is what drives me crazy.  So many people are quoting slogans or going
<br>
on &quot;faith&quot; in science and technology.  Science and technology aren't
<br>
supposed to based on &quot;faith&quot;.  It is so rampant that I believe that MOST of
<br>
the claims and predictions we hear today in the movement are over-hyped and
<br>
predicted to occur much sooner than they will.  This is NOT to say that I
<br>
don't believe in this stuff any more.  But it isn't here yet.  Somebody is
<br>
going to have to actually learn the technology and work on this stuff for a
<br>
few decades to bring about the stuff we are talking about.  The pop-culture
<br>
level of discussion we usually see just is out of touch with reality.###
