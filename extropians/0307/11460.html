</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually it just occurred to me; from a biological pov,
<br>
given how important gravity is to every day use,
<br>
we'ld all be equipped with significantly better gravity 
<br>
detectors :)  Kind of like &quot;use the force&quot; stuff.
<br>
<p>Amusing.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I can see that. Wouldn't the gravitational force also be weaker than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected if the voyager past the planet on its sun orbital trailing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end ? A kind of gravital doppler shift.
</em><br>
<p>I think in general we're probably confusing things; as someone more
<br>
versed than I pointed out, gravity can either be static [ignoring
<br>
motion]
<br>
or dynamic (even in our current universe); what you're doing when you
<br>
make
<br>
the propogation speed slower than the speed of light is arbitrarily
<br>
converting all cases of &quot;static&quot; gravity into dynamic cases [at least
<br>
relative to the light data]...    
<br>
<p>So, you have a planet which used to be considered static gravity
<br>
[constant
<br>
gravity emittor], which means effectively that at any point in space
<br>
that it occupied it emitted a summative field.  When it vacates a
<br>
position, the
<br>
area of space &quot;springs back' to its original configuration + the
<br>
trailing end
<br>
of the planet...[anyone know what the resiliancy of space with respect
<br>
to gravity (SEPerate from the propogation speed of gravity) is btw?]
<br>
<p>Now lets place an observer in front and behind of the planet relative to
<br>
its motion; the observer in front will see in an increase in gravity
<br>
(depending
<br>
on the propogation speed);  the frequency shift (doppler effect)
<br>
observed,
<br>
would be a &quot;speed up&quot; of the gravity field changes [the equivalent of
<br>
jerk].
<br>
Suddenly gravity would start increasing, and the rate at which it
<br>
increases
<br>
[remembering that gravity in and of itself is acceleration], would be
<br>
accelerating.
<br>
When he would see this sudden acceleration of gravity (no doubt
<br>
unpleasant),
<br>
would be a ratio of the speed he was going versus the speed of
<br>
propogation.
<br>
This would be the equivalent of the sonic boom.
<br>
<p>The observer in the back of the planet would at some point, see the
<br>
correct vacancy in terms of gravity... but it would take him some time
<br>
to see the vacancy for what it was (a shift in gravitational energies);
<br>
the reason being that the speed of the propogation would determine
<br>
when the final energies (relative to the motion) would be updated.
<br>
He would be seeing the equivalent of a gravitational &quot;flicker&quot;;
<br>
2 sources of information (the universe, and this planet), would be vying
<br>
to update his respective environment...  with the final result being
<br>
that of the universe winning, with relatively more time in between
<br>
for its frames...
<br>
<p>Now thats with interleaving within a time frame; but try normalizing
<br>
back to a single frame, and what you end up getting is intense
<br>
periods of supergravity in front of the moving gravity &quot;wave&quot;
<br>
and slow update in the trailing field (where you feel the effects
<br>
of gravity where there's no clear source for that gravity, relative
<br>
to how our notion of the universe works)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Even worse, Jupiter is actually moving &quot;supersonically&quot; in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; setting!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If Voyager is approaching from straight ahead of the planet it will
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experience any gravitational field since Jupiter is moving faster
</em><br>
than
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the information about where it is is spreading through the gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; field. So on one side of Jupiter you would actually be weightless! 
</em><br>
<p>&lt;&lt;cut&gt;&gt; on one side you could be *potentially* weightless, until the
<br>
gravity waves reach up and snag you. and then you would probably
<br>
be severely heavy, and if off-axis from the direction of motion,
<br>
probably sheared in half (or quarters or whatever :P).  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the other side all the information is present and you get normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gravity. And you get a discontinous bow shock where you go from no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gravity to a mix of several accelerations pointing towards many
</em><br>
former
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; positions (likely just causing an inward accleration into the shock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cone).
</em><br>
<p>perhaps :) I'm considering the simple case of a planet moving
<br>
with observers directly in line with its motion....
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>you: Hmm, interesting. An observer on the planet surface would, if
<br>
gravity 
<br>
behaved like it does here, observe the same gravity all around the 
<br>
surface regardless of where it was moving. An external observer would 
<br>
not see the same. 
<br>
<p>me: 
<br>
<p>it all depends on:
<br>
the speed of propogation,
<br>
the distance from the source, 
<br>
the decay of the gravitational attraction per meter, 
<br>
the resiliancy of space (refraction period similar to a neuron),
<br>
and of course, the vector of motion relative to the observer's position.
<br>
<p>if you really want to have some fun, consider the planet not as a point
<br>
source, but as a series of point sources...then look at it from the
<br>
observers point of view....(six gagillion gravitional shockwaves 
<br>
all happening simoultaneously underneath said person).
<br>
<p>I daresay given the eddy currents involved in front, you would never
<br>
really get a planet in the first place; at least not one that's stable.
<br>
<p><p>you:
<br>
My model is based on having gravity disturbances move 
<br>
relative to a fixed spacetime *at a constant speed relative to this
<br>
frame*. 
<br>
There cannot be a fast or slow gravity wave in my model, all gravity
<br>
waves 
<br>
move at the speed g. Just like light in relativity and sound in still 
<br>
air. If we allow gravity waves of different speeds then things get 
<br>
*really* messy and interesting. I guess a fast moving planet would have 
<br>
a field that moved fast to a receiver, while a slowly moving planet 
<br>
would have a slowly expanding field. I think we need extra assumptions 
<br>
here, and the whole thing starts to look like the theory of nonlinear 
<br>
waves. Very interesting, but confusing. 
<br>
