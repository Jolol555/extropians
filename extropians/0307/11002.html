The important thing is whether or not the controller is programmed to allow 
<br>
access to these data. Just because a program keeps a running average of 
<br>
speed does not mean it keeps that data in a format that can be read by a 
<br>
technician.
<br>
<p>Embedded processors are not like PCs in that once the critter is programmed 
<br>
you lose access to the internal memory unless you specifically write code 
<br>
to allow such access. Some processors have in-circuit-debug ports that 
<br>
allow someone with the source code and a map file to go in and examine 
<br>
memory locations, but without the source (trade secret) and the map file 
<br>
(ditto), you are just hacking. Without the debug port, you're stuck.
<br>
<p>It's trivial, though, to write code using a non-volatile memory chip to 
<br>
store the last five minute's worth of data points, and code to dump this in 
<br>
a human-readable form through the diagnostic port - this is what GM has 
<br>
done, evidently.
<br>
<p>I see federal legislation forcing all manufacturers to standardize a format 
<br>
and recording duration, similar to what has been done in the last couple of 
<br>
years with engine data relating to pollution control. We will also need a 
<br>
law prohibiting disconnection of the road speed sensor - perhaps this comes 
<br>
under the heading of &quot;odometer fraud&quot;.
<br>
<p>I also see new applications for &quot;mini-EMP&quot; generators or a smidgen of 
<br>
Thermit...
