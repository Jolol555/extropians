<em>&gt; I'm hesitant to go compiling a list of particular posts I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think to be the _cause._ 
</em><br>
<p>I, too, am tired of constantly being asked to give particulars over and
<br>
over.  Anybody who doesn't see the problem just isn't paying attention
<br>
and doesn't want to see it.  The archives are there, anybody can find
<br>
anything they want to.  Nobody should need to ask anybody else to tell
<br>
the what has happened in the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There feels, to me, to be a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of out-of-touchness among extropians on the list.
</em><br>
<p>This also seems very true, and a lot of different people have been
<br>
commenting on this lately.  Interestingly, they are all coming from
<br>
different directions, ascribing different causes, and come from
<br>
different political and social backgrounds that are often at odds with
<br>
each other.  But a lot of people seem to agree that we need to be doing
<br>
some sort of reality check.  It very well may be that the technology
<br>
scandals have made us question technology, the economy has made us
<br>
question perpetual growth, terrorism has made us question political
<br>
advancement, and the lack of progress has made us question dynamic
<br>
optimism (or at least irrational exuberance).  Or it may just be that
<br>
the flame-wars and personal attacks have made this list so uncomfortable
<br>
that people are questioning whether it is worth the effort anymore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These are some thoughts.  I hope this is useful to people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not perceived as unwarranted criticism.  I've definitely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten a fair number of &quot;me-too&quot; offlist responses, so other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do feel this way.
</em><br>
<p>I, too, have been flooded with offlist &quot;me-too&quot; responses to a number of
<br>
different items that I have posted in the last couple of months.  Sadly,
<br>
there seems to be a very large and silent contingent that is too afraid
<br>
or too tired to speak up, due to the flamewars and personal attacks on
<br>
the list.  Almost all of the &quot;me-too&quot; messages thank me for speaking up
<br>
and explain that the sender prefers to speak off-list rather than on the
<br>
list.  I have come to question whether any communication here is
<br>
possible.  It seems that there is more suppression of ideas than
<br>
creation of ideas.  It seems that more people feel compelled to keep
<br>
silent rather than feel compelled to participate.
