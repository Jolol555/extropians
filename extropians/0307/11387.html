</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why do you think the informed choice metric runs this way?  I would guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the opposite - that most people, asked to make a deliberate choice between
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't disagree that many would feel guilty, but I'm not sure your

</em><br>
<p>I think you misunderstood this point: the claim seems to be that people
<br>
who chose to betray the tribe would feel guilty *instead* of feeling happy
<br>
about their decision; this suggests that your two metrics are at odds on
<br>
this central fundamental case.
<br>
<p>Indeed, it seems to me that, to the extent that they reasoned about it
<br>
clearly, betrayers might say:  &quot;Argh!  I should never have acted on my
<br>
first-order desires for power... I knew then that I wished I didn't have
<br>
those first-order desires, but I acted on them anyway, and now I'm
<br>
miserable.  I *truly* desired not to do that, but I did it anyway, woe is
<br>
I.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;What is the justification for taking such a dark view of things?  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;make this claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is my reading of what the data tell us.
</em><br>
<p>Fascinating, but utterly lacking in content. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;The folk picture of people struggling between their high moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;aspirations and their inner demons is, as far as I can tell, pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;much correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The folk picture that most people are much more concerned about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearing moral than being moral is also pretty much correct.
</em><br>
<p>So you keep saying.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;My own claim is that if you asked people what they cared about, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mattered most to them, what kind of person they wanted to be, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would say that the altruism is the most important part of them.  Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that is what they tell me, why should I - or any friend of theirs -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;contradict them?  The deliberative system may sometimes be weak, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is ultimately in charge - or at least is the center I look to, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;determine how to find the &quot;person&quot; I want to &quot;help&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the heart of our dispute.  As in discussions of whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload, or its copy, would &quot;really be you&quot;, there is an element of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition or choice in looking into a complex contradictory person and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying what their &quot;real&quot; preferences are.  If you aren't going to appeal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any criteria about why this is a good choice, but just declare it by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition, then there isn't much more to talk about.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly right... which is why I argue that the argument is a
<br>
philosophical one, and not (per se) an economic one.  I know you'll object
<br>
to that notion, but what the economists are trying to figure out is
<br>
something entirely different from what the philosophers are trying to
<br>
figure out.
<br>
<p>The economists are trying to decide on a model to predict human behavior;
<br>
instead of looking at the complicated mess of desires we actually have,
<br>
they select some set of simplified idealized desires, and use those to
<br>
predict our behavior.  Doing this research is a good idea, but when the
<br>
economist actually takes that leap and calls those desires our &quot;real&quot;
<br>
desires, (which, I'll admit, must be irresistable after working long
<br>
enough in the field,) he steps entirely out of the area on which we HAVE
<br>
any data.
<br>
<p>The economist who claims that his useful predictors are the &quot;real&quot; desires
<br>
is engaging in metaphysics, par excellence: they are deciding on what we
<br>
should call &quot;real&quot; and what we should call the &quot;mere appearances&quot;.
<br>
Certainly the economists should have some input into this question, but
<br>
they certainly shouldn't get the last word, even if all of the data points
<br>
them squarely at a certain model in particular.  At the end of the day,
<br>
all the economist can claim to have identified is the best possible model
<br>
of our economic desires, or our desires as economic actors.  That's just
<br>
one factor that we take into consideration when we engage in philosophy.
<br>
<p>On the point of philosophy, especially moral philosophy, I take it that
<br>
the cynicalism which you so consistently espouse has serious problems.
<br>
As I have argued before, these &quot;dark pictures&quot; of human society for which
<br>
Eliezer has consistently taken you to task constitute exactly the sort of
<br>
conceptual scheme that any plausible normative component of your theory
<br>
would argue that we shouldn't endorse to other people, and which, as we
<br>
discussed at length in an earlier thread, we shouldn't believe.
<br>
<p>Your philosophy does not warrant its own assertion; it is not rational to
<br>
claim to have it, and it could never be so if it were true.
<br>
<p>Our choice of metaphysics, our selection of which sorts of words we claim
<br>
will &quot;really&quot; describe us, as opposed to merely &quot;useful&quot; models, directly
<br>
tie back into the way we should behave.  Should we trust ourselves and our
<br>
fellows?  Should we coordinate in families, co-ops, unions, businesses and
<br>
nations to promote our common good?  If so, what should we say about
<br>
ourselves and these cooperative ventures?  On this account, all of the
<br>
economic data in the world can and should be cast aside as a merely
<br>
&quot;useful&quot; model, as it runs afoul with our strongest held ethical
<br>
principles: principles about the ethics of belief and group association.
<br>
<p>I argue that, whatever the economic data may show, we'll always be free to
<br>
adopt a metaphysical stance about &quot;real&quot; cognitive beliefs that I might
<br>
call &quot;morally uplifting&quot; and which you might call &quot;self-flattering&quot;. ;)
<br>
The data doesn't show what we should do or say; only our moral convictions
<br>
can show that.  And, in this case, it seems obvious that anti-realism
<br>
about the economic data is exactly what's in order here.
<br>
<p>I morally exhort you to take an anti-realistic stance to the &quot;data&quot; you've
<br>
been observing and to adopt more conventional metaphysical stance in a
<br>
hurry.
