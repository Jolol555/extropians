My first thoughts was along the lines that once not so long ago, 80% of all
<br>
jobs were in agriculture. I must admint that i fail to see 80% unemployment
<br>
today, now machines have taken over allmost all agriculture work, and I also
<br>
must admit that those having the lowest paid jobs today get much more and
<br>
are much wealthier than those having the lowest paid jobs then.
<br>
<p>So.. if robots come take 50 million of the most boring jobs, everyone should
<br>
get a big lift in wealth, like the lift we got when we stopped working in
<br>
the fields with no machines. I'm not sure why it is so, but it seems that
<br>
every time we invent a machine to do 100 men's jobs, everyone, including the
<br>
100 men are better off after a few years. The total productivity of every
<br>
person rises, and i think this in the end is what is the deciding factor
<br>
regarding how wealthy we are. The more wealthy we are as a group, the more
<br>
we are able to take on jobs that are fun, it seems.
<br>
<p>Someone might take their time to research this point (that historically
<br>
automation has been leading to great wealth)  (i'm sure it has been
<br>
researched) and use it as a positive counter-example of the doom and gloom
<br>
meme that the article supports.
