</em><br>
<p>Who says it's an evolutionarily stable strategy?  Linguistic argument 
<br>
about politics is pretty recent.  We may be looking at a simple attack 
<br>
that requires a complex defense, one that would require another coupla 
<br>
hundred thousand years to evolve.  Evolution is slow; it plays long, slow 
<br>
games; and we may just be at a midpoint of it.
<br>
<p>Or another possibility:  If you've got a mutation that leads you to be 
<br>
suspicious, and you're the *only* one with that mutation, it ain't 
<br>
necessarily a reproductive advantage.  If anything, people seem to have 
<br>
actively strong faith in tribal leaders, and given what happens to people 
<br>
who openly express doubts, I'm guessing that the evolutionary force behind 
<br>
that emotional faith has nothing to do with the tribal leaders actually 
<br>
being good guys - more like a heritable tendency that was a reproductive 
<br>
advantage because its bearers ended up joining the winning side.  Think 
<br>
Nash equilibria.
<br>
<p>The thing to remember is not just that some emotions are amazingly enough 
<br>
adaptive, but that *every* emotion is there because it was adaptive, and 
<br>
moreover, we have that set of emotions which was given us by a force which 
<br>
was thinking *only* about the number of surviving grandchildren, and no 
<br>
other criterion.  That is, it's not that human emotions have to be post 
<br>
facto rationalized as adaptive - it's that we have those emotions, and 
<br>
only those emotions, that you would expect to find in a design built 
<br>
purely around adaptiveness.  It takes a long while to realize that this is 
<br>
what you are looking at when you see a human... but the amazing thing is 
<br>
that it really is true.  There is nowhere else that emotions could 
<br>
possibly come from.  The design forces involved are just very... indirect.
