<p>
In response to Mike Lorrey (see below or go to
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0307/12188.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0307/12188.html</a>:)
<br>
<p>And just who decides and how that this individual
<br>
violates the Geneva Conventions by acting as an
<br>
illegal combatant?  The U.S. military?  Without a
<br>
public trial by jury?  How convenient.  As I said, if
<br>
rights are defined as due process, then we are all
<br>
perfectly free right now (to follow the law, that is).
<br>
<p>The whole point of Guantanemo is that these people are
<br>
accused of something which carries legal penalties. 
<br>
That accusation does not constitute a conviction.  No
<br>
matter WHO makes it.  That's the whole point of public
<br>
trials, juries, due process and the recognition of
<br>
basic human rights, which exist independent of any law
<br>
or state.  AFTER they have been convicted by a proper
<br>
public jury process, with access to counsel, privacy,
<br>
rights to appeal, etc., THEN, if they are duly
<br>
convicted, and ONLY THEN can you with any claim of
<br>
legitimacy make the kind of ludicrous Kafkaesque
<br>
claims you make below.
<br>
<p>BTW, my understanding is that now all the U.S. state
<br>
has to do to nail you or me is to make a similar
<br>
declaration that we have de facto, by our actions,
<br>
given up our U.S. citizenship - and all the &quot;rights&quot;
<br>
(as they now define &quot;rights&quot;) it entails - by acting
<br>
as a foreign combatant.  Then we could end up down
<br>
there too - and we might.
<br>
<p>On another related note, I am sorry if I have confused
<br>
the discussion of a &quot;free state.&quot;  Originally I know
<br>
the discussion referred to an existing &quot;state&quot; of the
<br>
U.S.  However, somewhere along the thread, the
<br>
perspective broadened and that's where I came in.  The
<br>
same issues apply however in the narrower context, and
<br>
any reliance upon &quot;state sovereignty&quot; or &quot;state's
<br>
rights&quot; might be dampened by reference to the Fed's
<br>
actions here in California, where they have had no
<br>
qualms about going after medical mariuana users,
<br>
despite objections from the &quot;state.&quot;  
<br>
<p>I do agree, however, that moving any &quot;state&quot; in the
<br>
general direction of libertarianism would be a good
<br>
thing, and I am considering what actions I might take
<br>
if this project appears likely to actually succeed.  I
<br>
note that Mary Margarette in Fort Collins, CO, tried
<br>
this a decade or more ago, and got quite a few
<br>
libertarians to move there, but apparently without any
<br>
great impact.
<br>
<p>Here's the quotes from Mike:

<p>Mike Lorrey (<a href="mailto:mlorrey@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20On%20Libertarianism%20and%20founding%20a%20free%20state%20(was%20Re:%20Food%20labels%20etc)">mlorrey@yahoo.com</a>)

<br>
<p>No, you are conflating two separate issues. 
<br>
<p>When an individual violates the Geneva Conventions by
<br>
acting as an illegal combatant, ALL of their rights
<br>
are automatically forfeit BECAUSE of their crime of
<br>
acting as an illegal combatant. They can be legally
<br>
executed summarily without trial. These are not
<br>
innocent men in Gitmo's prison. They are killers who
<br>
refuse to wear a uniform, who attack civilians and
<br>
torture innocents. They refuse to operate by the 
<br>
Geneva Conventions, and since they choose to operate
<br>
in violation of the laws of war, they will be tried
<br>
outside the civilian court system, for their crime is
<br>
not a civil crime, it is a military one. 
<br>
<p>I have several times asked people to read the Geneva
<br>
Conventions, please do not make any more unsupported
<br>
claims about such things until you do so.
<br>
<p>**************
<br>
<p>Me: and you know, without any due process, trial,
<br>
etc., that these people are guilty as charged, because
<br>
you just trust the U.S. military, or whoever is making
<br>
that claim?  Great.  We can save a whole passel of
<br>
money here.  Just put those people in place of our
<br>
juries in general.
