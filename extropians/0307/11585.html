<p>Well, Wired stopped being relevant some time ago.  There is still a fair 
<br>
amount of technological determinism (Singularity is inevitable) to be had.  
<br>
But I think you are right that the current conditions (all of them not just 
<br>
economic suckiness) are a wake-up call that there is a great deal of work to 
<br>
be done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dynamic optimism is about actually doing something constructive. Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the IT sector is not doing great. But then we better invent new killer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apps or find ways of using the existing in better ways. With cheap

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually, no they can't.  It is *extremely* difficult to get funding for new 
<br>
projects regardless of the cost of some levels of programming talent.   On 
<br>
projects I have been in the cost of programmers themselves was a most 30% and 
<br>
usually a lot less.  Senior people cannot be pulled just off the shelf at 
<br>
whatever price.   They usually also have fixed costs and overhead in their 
<br>
lives that cannot be low-balled out of if they are to have any life at all or 
<br>
be productive much less loyal.    Management and marketing also are not 
<br>
commodified.  The market for the software is very soft due to across the 
<br>
board economic uncertainty.  So ROI cases are more difficult to make.  So no, 
<br>
cheaper programming labor does not translate into &quot;many new projects&quot;.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I am *more* optimistic about the transhuman future today than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was just three years ago. We are finally starting to grow up.
</em><br>
<p><p>I feel less optimistic primary for political and social reasons.  We are 
<br>
seriously invested in walking the path of fear using whatever technologies we 
<br>
have and are soon to be created.   This path leads to some very dystopian 
<br>
outcomes.    It has become harder to project a believable positive course.
