<p>*Robin's* hubris?
<br>
<p>Is this a typo, or do you really mean Robin Hanson?
<br>
<p>I can understand why people accuse me of hubris, but Robin?  Robin is 
<br>
obviously restraining, discounting, and understating his estimation of his 
<br>
own abilities, to the point where it's clear that he does in fact possess 
<br>
more intelligence than he is willing to publicly attribute to himself. 
<br>
And he's done that so carefully that I can't even tell what his real 
<br>
estimation of his own intelligence is.  (As for his real intelligence, of 
<br>
course, I can't tell that either - not by looking at the portion of his 
<br>
ideas that he's selected as being possible to explain.)  In short, Robin 
<br>
is playing exactly by the social modesty rules.  Is the &quot;hubris&quot; part that 
<br>
he is visibly doing just that, playing, or does he actually somehow manage 
<br>
to sound hubristic?  If Robin manages to come across as arrogant, I'll 
<br>
probably just give up on the whole issue.
