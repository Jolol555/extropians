</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it does not advance rational discussion.  It was a serious 
<br>
question, though.  The disconnect between the words being verbally 
<br>
manipulated into sentence streams, and all affect, emotion, intuitive 
<br>
visualization, was large enough to make me start wondering about Robert's 
<br>
sanity, or at least such small sanity as humans are supposed to have.
<br>
<p>The Hiroshima bomber crew did not, contrary to legend, have nightmares 
<br>
about it.  They flew back, Truman told them that he took responsibility, 
<br>
and that was that.  Can you imagine if they'd had to walk along a line of 
<br>
seventy thousand people and, one by one, slit their throats - let alone 
<br>
being forced to burn them in fire?  One by one, letting each soldier or 
<br>
man or woman or schoolchild finish dying before moving on to the next? 
<br>
They would not have gotten past the first ten, they would have had 
<br>
nightmares for the rest of their lives, and if Truman told them he 
<br>
&quot;accepted full responsibility&quot; it would have been a pathetic, useless 
<br>
token.  Dave Grossman is exactly right; technological distance is 
<br>
emotional distance.  Bomber crews don't have nightmares because they wield 
<br>
buttons instead of knives, though the suffering they cause is vastly greater.
<br>
<p>Robert Bradbury has no goddamn idea what the words coming out of his mouth 
<br>
actually mean.  That much is clear.  And similarly the people who dropped 
<br>
the bomb on Hiroshima had no goddamn idea what that button actually did, 
<br>
regardless of what verbal ideas were floating around in their heads.  Hugo 
<br>
de Garis has no goddamn idea of what a 'gigadeath' 'artilect war' would 
<br>
involve, and Ben Goertzel has no goddamn idea that AI is an existential 
<br>
risk, regardless of what words they put down on paper.  Being unable to 
<br>
relate abstract verbal thought to negative affect is not a charming 
<br>
personal quirk.  Robert is just emotionally disconnected from the results 
<br>
of what he's saying, not evil; he has no idea that he might be doing 
<br>
something wrong, though he realizes in a distant way that he ought to 
<br>
acknowledge the possibility.  But y'know, by golly, I bet that when all 
<br>
the bodies are counted up across the galaxies, it's the Roberts and not 
<br>
the Hitlers who account for most of the planetary kills.  There comes a 
<br>
point where stupidity stops being innocent, and it doesn't really matter 
<br>
anymore whether you have to be emotionally evil as well as verbally evil 
<br>
to genuinely be a bad person.  I think that line is crossed when you start 
<br>
talking about the use of nuclear weapons to commit genocide against those 
<br>
darn foreigners because paying attention would be too inconvenient.
