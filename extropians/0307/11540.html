<p>Is that why we did that?  I was wondering.
<br>
Curious, tho, we have had several flamefests
<br>
way worse than the one that broke out in May
<br>
and June.  I need to check it however, for
<br>
I was having a lot of computer problems then
<br>
and much of my email was being automatically
<br>
deleted, so I mighta missed it.
<br>
<p>In any case, this is extropians.  We are 
<br>
famous for flaming each other's brains out, then
<br>
going on the next day as if nothing happened.
<br>
What changed?
<br>
<p>I had an idea that has been bothering me.  We
<br>
are seeing a recession that won't go away and
<br>
a future that none of us expected.  The late
<br>
90s was a time that was perfect for best-do-it-so
<br>
attitudes, was it not?  We had a notion that
<br>
the growth rate we were seeing was a runup
<br>
before the singularity.  
<br>
<p>Now we realize that the growth rates in just
<br>
about anything related to the internet was all
<br>
Worldcom-generated fiction, so much smoke and
<br>
mirrors.  My investment portfolio was a mirror
<br>
of the times, and now it is mostly smoke.  The
<br>
list has a lot of software types, and surely
<br>
the professional programmers must be having
<br>
a severe case of Custer Syndrome: &quot;Where are
<br>
all these frigging Indians coming from?&quot;  
<br>
Cryonics has had a few setbacks, and it is 
<br>
becoming clearer all the time that many of our 
<br>
biotech dreams are going to be fouled up by
<br>
several parties, the Greens, the anti-globalists,
<br>
Religion Incorporated, the liability lawyers etc.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the flamewar was it, but it might just
<br>
be the times.  Dynamic and practical optimism 
<br>
has been more difficult in the last couple years,
<br>
has it not?
