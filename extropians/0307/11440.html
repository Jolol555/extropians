Robert Bradbury wrote: &quot;Research has uncovered more complexity than was

reconcile.&quot;... Robert
<br>
<p>Thanks Robert.  When I read this, I marvel
<br>
at the drama in the timing of the rise of
<br>
technology-capable humans.  Imagine an Earth 
<br>
with no humans but all the other species
<br>
the same as now.  (It isn't hard to do.)  There
<br>
is a definite carbon sink in the form of forests
<br>
dying and being buried by some means, silt from
<br>
a flood, ash from a nearby volcano, blowing dust, 
<br>
etc, resulting in vast coal seams and (by some 
<br>
mysterious means) oil fields.  
<br>
<p>If one looks at the amount of carbon in the earth's
<br>
atmosphere as a function of time, it is straight
<br>
downhill, is it not?  When the earth had a reducing
<br>
atmosphere, there was all that methane and carbon
<br>
dioxide.  Plants came, generated oxygen, which broke
<br>
down the methane, steadily depleted the CO2, converting
<br>
it into coal and oil, carbon forms which are out of
<br>
reach of the lifeforms that evolved here.  Well, all
<br>
of the lifeforms except humans.
<br>
<p>Without some means of restoring that carbon to the
<br>
biosphere, it would have been curtains for all life 
<br>
on this planet.  It would have gradually suffocated
<br>
for lack of raw material, perhaps in the next billion 
<br>
years, steadily fading away with robust memories, 
<br>
like the Civil War soldier's reunion.  
<br>
<p>Then at a critical moment in the history of life on
<br>
earth, technologically capable humans came charging
<br>
to the rescue, freeing that carbon and restoring the
<br>
planet to habitability.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is the fate of life on most habitable
<br>
planets: a carbon sink eventually places the carbon
<br>
out of reach of lifeforms before a technological
<br>
species can evolve and dig it up, restoring the carbon
<br>
and all other life on the planet.  Perhaps only one
<br>
planet in a million enjoys such a dramatic rescue.
<br>
<p>Would this not explain the great cosmological radio 
<br>
silence?
