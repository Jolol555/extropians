<p>Please clarify what you believe these &quot;ignoble&quot; things are that you

hypothesize people &quot;really&quot; want regardless of what they say.

<p>Why would you put the supposedly distinct things people want above what they

want to want which presumably include their &quot;higher&quot; or less &quot;ignoble&quot;

aspirations?   Why would self-modification more likely server what you 
<br>
believe is the base reality?
