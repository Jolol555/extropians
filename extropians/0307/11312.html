<p>
There is a certain perspective about riding a
<br>
motorcycle that one misses in an enclosed vehicle:
<br>
<p>To wit, &quot;whatever happens is going to happen to me
<br>
personally.&quot;
<br>
<p>On the other hand, those typically young afluent fems
<br>
who drive the enormous 4x4's generally have the
<br>
perspective, &quot;I have two tons of steel around me, dumb
<br>
sucker riding your little motorcycle.  I'm
<br>
invulnerable and feeling bitchy.  I think I'll move
<br>
into your lane now.  Better get out of the way...
<br>
quickly.  Oops, too slow.&quot;
<br>
<p>I prefer my motorcycle, nonetheless.  Anyone can be
<br>
brave with two tons of steel to play with.  I like to
<br>
sync/ground my feelings and general reactions to
<br>
reality, both for esthetic reasons and for survival. 
<br>
While riding a motorcycle my survival is totally up to
<br>
me.  There's not much margin for error.  So, two or
<br>
more times each day, I put myself in harm's way in the
<br>
belief that it will serve as a spiritual,
<br>
psychological vaccine against the day when I really do
<br>
need to react well and fast.  Of course, one day it
<br>
might kill me, so it's playing the odds.  
<br>
<p>And, on the sexual vein of this thread, I don't feel
<br>
particularly macho because I ride a bike, but I do
<br>
think that being more grounded in general in my
<br>
feelings makes the potential for any real relationship
<br>
that much better.
<br>
<p>So many temptations and addictions lie in wait to suck
<br>
us away from a reality orientation.  I look for ways
<br>
to short-circuit them.  Reality, what a trip!
