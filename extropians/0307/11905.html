</em><br>
<p>Not really; I think you are right that self-directed evolution is probably
<br>
has to be happening in any technologically advanced civilisation, just to
<br>
get to the point where it can enter space in a serious way, and be able to
<br>
attempt mega-scale engineering (which is 
<br>
where you enter the realm of the fermi paradox).
<br>
<p>However, I'd dispute the assertion that something like the extropian
<br>
principles are necessary. The extropian principles are a good guide (we
<br>
think) for individualists to progress technology and end up in the realm of
<br>
fp. However, I do think that many other entirely different intellectual
<br>
bases for action are possible, that can lead to this result (as I covered in
<br>
another post). So self-directed evolution could look wildly different, with
<br>
different cultural starting points and environmental factors.
<br>
<p>I really think it's important when reasoning about possible alien
<br>
motivations, to acknowledge that we really don't have the &quot;one true path&quot;;
<br>
we just have a way that we happen to favour. A lot of reasoning here seems
<br>
to point toward a hidden value of perfectionism, and an idea that there is
<br>
some kind of platonic ideal (a global maximum?) toward which we strive when
<br>
we progress. 
<br>
<p>Really, that is not even supported by extropianism itself, which is *not*
<br>
utilitarian, and is *not* perfectionist or platonist; it's a philosophy
<br>
about individuals doing their own thing in their own way, coexisting with
<br>
others. It's about diversity, not a drive toward ultimate sameness. Nothing
<br>
in our experience of the universe should lead us to believe that we are
<br>
evolving to some perfect form/perfect way, or that there is a perfect way to
<br>
be/behave. Complex systems just don't work like that.
<br>
<p>That's my reading of it, anyway.
