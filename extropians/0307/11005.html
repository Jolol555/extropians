</em><br>
<p>I think this whole 'uploading' notion is a complete fallacy.
<br>
Consciusness is an evolved process that has taken millenia, and
<br>
only occurs in living e-1 organisms. The illusion of a 'self' separate
<br>
from the backdrop of the rest of the universe is a trick of nature
<br>
caused by the brain constructing a phantom primal eye (from
<br>
neural information) concurrent with the neural information of
<br>
the external or internally generated sense-data. 
<br>
<p>Agreed, a massively distributed parallel silicon network could
<br>
represent data, but it's evolution - - designed and not 
<br>
embryionically recapitulated -- does not include a phantom 
<br>
primal sensor(gan). The chemical reactions of REM are not 
<br>
present in the silicion case, so no dreams, or waking dream
<br>
that is conscious awareness (see Globus' Real-Time hypothesis).
<br>
Content, but no self-referential form. SORRY FOLKS.
