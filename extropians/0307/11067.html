</em><br>
<p>Right, the self is not &quot;the will to survive&quot;, but I *would*
<br>
say that it is a sort of algorithm modeling the universe
<br>
including itself.  But then I have an overly broad view of
<br>
what *algorithms* encompass  8^D
<br>
<p>Indeed, I have never thought to try to define &quot;self&quot;.  But
<br>
it seems to me that it is a species of *person*, which I have
<br>
tried to define.  Yes, persons are algorithms or programs,
<br>
but ones with very special features.  Some kinds of programs
<br>
not only map the external rooms in which they are housed, but
<br>
often (in the case of animals) only do so from the perspective
<br>
of the center, that is, they see the world only through their
<br>
own eyes.  Yet this is sufficient for personhood, and for a 
<br>
self.
<br>
<p>So we begin to enumerate the characteristics that a program
<br>
(ideally housed in a robot body) ought to have to qualify as
<br>
a person (i.e., to have a self).  Now for each of the following,
<br>
I expect that there are exceptions, namely, pathological cases
<br>
in which a criterion is voided:
<br>
<p>1. the program has a belief in a boundary that separates
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself from &quot;other&quot;
<br>
2. the program must have a bias in favor of interpreting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all knowledge in terms of how it itself is affected
<br>
3. it must strive for consistency in its maps; it will not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do for it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to fall into repetitive modes of actions each undoing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) given a stimulus, to apply at random two entirely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different behavior routines
<br>
4. it must act (at least at the lower levels) to do what is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary or traditional for it to survive (e.g., metabolism)
<br>
<p>and of course this list is not complete.  And I repeat, any
<br>
one of these conditions can probably be found unnecessary in
<br>
some example; e.g., for the last, a robot might be constructed
<br>
out of some indestructible materials and placed in an environment
<br>
where it could not possibly come to harm.
<br>
<p>Thus trees do not have selves, but most animals do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can experience arise from that??
</em><br>
<p>I hope that my answers are half as good as your questions!  8^D
<br>
<p>It is necessary to proceed in the 3rd person, because 1st
<br>
person accounts fail.  Therefore, we are asking why the
<br>
organism or robot has experiences, and we keep our point
<br>
of view OUTSIDE the subject we are investigating.
<br>
<p>The entity acts on its programming and its sensory input---
<br>
that much is clear.  Evolution (or Nature, or the next generation
<br>
programmers) has also seen fit to equip the entity with storage
<br>
mechanisms for currently received information and two kinds of
<br>
processing that attend this &quot;memory&quot;.  One kind funnels the
<br>
incoming sensory data with recent memories and current lusts
<br>
or drives, into what we should call a state of mind.  The second
<br>
kind nearly instantaneously matches this state against the entire
<br>
memory store by an incredibly efficient algorithm, and funnels any
<br>
hits  that result, into further processing resulting in actions,
<br>
or (in advanced entities) plans for actions.
<br>
<p>To us, looking down upon the entity or animal, this processing
<br>
is called &quot;experience&quot;, and we say that the entity is undergoing
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>Now all this makes perfect sense, I would think, and hardly comes
<br>
as any sort of surprise or revelation---it seems quite clear why
<br>
entities would have arisen in nature having these features.  The
<br>
only problem comes (perhaps) when the old issue is raised about
<br>
&quot;what it is like to *be* one of these entities&quot;; and we end up
<br>
trying to delve into 1st person accounts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why are they aware? What function does it serve? Algorithms and qualia don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to mix well (if qualia correctly represents what I am trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe, which I suspect it doesn't).
</em><br>
<p>Their awareness (continuing the 3rd person account) serves
<br>
to insure their survivability in a Darwinian universe.  I
<br>
have never found any discussion of qualia to advance understanding
<br>
an iota (but see below).  Keeping the 3rd person perspective,
<br>
one can see what is happening in the monkey brain of the subject,
<br>
and we can (in principle though not yet in exact detail) account
<br>
for its cries, its fears, its cunning, and its hopes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I am finding that emphasizing the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tegmark's &quot;frog perspective&quot; and &quot;bird perspective&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; helps clarity an old dichotomy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know this example.
</em><br>
<p>Tegmark tackles Everything (as in Theory Of) in his cosmological
<br>
paper <a href="http://it.arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131">http://it.arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131</a> .  He discusses
<br>
(briefly buried way in there) whether and when to use the 1st
<br>
person frog perspective or the 3rd person bird perspective.  An
<br>
unabashed platonist, Tegmark says that if you want to have the big
<br>
picture, want to know the truth, then go for the bird perspective.
<br>
<p>As for me, when I look down at the monkey on the laboratory table,
<br>
I can see clearly all the limitations that his brain has for
<br>
understanding the world about him, and even where his grasp of
<br>
the world is good, how biased and prejudicial are its internal
<br>
renderings.
<br>
<p>So, then, stepping back a moment, I can readily understand that
<br>
I myself must have similar shortcomings, and suffer (not too 
<br>
strong a word) from a limited perspective.  So just as we can
<br>
only infer by analogy what four dimensions are &quot;like&quot;, so can
<br>
we only IMO keep looking at that monkey and repeating, &quot;my
<br>
own experience must be something like that&quot;.
<br>
<p>Or I can imagine being strapped down in a large circular operating
<br>
room.  On the beds next to me are other people, very much like me.
<br>
Overhead is a giant view screen that shows in incredible 23rd
<br>
century detail the internal workings of the brains of the subjects
<br>
(one of which I am) in the room.
<br>
<p>I note the essential similarity of everyone's brains, and even the
<br>
amazing degree to which the language regions are remarkably the
<br>
same (they all speak the King's English, it turns out).  So of all
<br>
these nearly identical depictions, one is mine.
<br>
<p>Now the experiment begins.  A needle is jabbed into the finger of
<br>
the first person and we all hear a yelp of pain.  We note on the
<br>
overhead monitor how one of the brains has just undergone a well-
<br>
known reaction.  Then another subject is poked, and we see the
<br>
identical transformation on another screen.  Once again, neural
<br>
conduction from the finger to the arm to the subcortical and 
<br>
finally the cortical regions is clearly shown.  There is also
<br>
attending surprise, anger, and escape mechanisms voluntary and 
<br>
involuntary.  The same glands, etc.
<br>
<p>Suddenly my vision turns red with anger and *I* have an overwhelming
<br>
sensation of pain; yet another part of my mind verifies (or is able
<br>
to a couple of seconds later) that brain #201 has behaved exactly
<br>
as all the others.  Yet, to me, there was obviously something very
<br>
special about #201.
<br>
<p>What else can be said?  What else needs to be said?  I don't see
<br>
anything the slightest bit mysterious here, once I have done two
<br>
things:
<br>
<p>1. FULLY and TOTALLY and UNIMPEACHABLY have renounced any form
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of nonmaterialism, and accept that the physics is all that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is
<br>
2. FULLY and TOTALLY and UNIMPEACHABLY have understood and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepted that I can never escape being a particular one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the entities.
