Damien writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;See how Damien recently reacted to a suggestion by Robert :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not anyone's mother. My capital letter bark at Robert
</em><br>
<p>I am glad I missed that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when he raised nuclear genocide as a possible rational and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *morally preferable* option was the revolted reaction of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend who, out of politeness, did not wish to say publicly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what Eliezer said: `Are you autistic?' 
</em><br>
<p>That's a pretty dumb question!  Like your probable remarks,
<br>
it does far more to connote a frame of mind (a rather 
<br>
deplorable frame of mind IMO) than it does to advance 
<br>
rational discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is tricky, because I like Robert, he has been generous in his support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of me,
</em><br>
<p>Hah, hah!  So *that's* why it's tricky.  But for the personal
<br>
connection, I infer it'd be clear as day to you!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But still, here's the analogy that springs to mind: you're all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sitting around in the bar, various groups [see that!] conversing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or singing at various pitches of intimacy or boisterousness, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone known to the company comes in and starts spraying one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wall, using liquid excrement, with words such as HOW ABOUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LYNCHING ALL THE [NIG]---------?.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do freedom-loving folks smile, grimace, shrug, and turn back to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drinks?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, probably grimace and ignore her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do they invite him [Oh, sorry, it's a &quot;he&quot;] over, still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reeking, and begin a reasoned discussion about how best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to lynch all the -------, some judiciously raising the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative position that perhaps it might be preferable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all costs and benefits taken into account, *not* to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the -------?
</em><br>
<p>Here is where your miserable analogy falls to the ground
<br>
the most rapidly.  That idiot *screaming* in capital letters
<br>
on the walls of the bar resembles *not* Robert's reasoned
<br>
tone, but the certain person *screaming* in capital
<br>
letters at Robert!
<br>
<p>How can you be blind to the obvious analogy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that Robert was not *advising* anyone to murder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10^8 human beings, nor would his advice have any force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with those so empowered if he *had* urged that course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than just raising it for consideration. Not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.
</em><br>
<p>Here is a better analogy:  you are in a bar having a very
<br>
polite discussion with highly intelligent people (read very
<br>
polite discussion with highly intelligent Extropians on a
<br>
forum) and after a long time, a young black woman says,
<br>
with no white people within earshot (read no North Koreans
<br>
contributing to our discussion) &quot;you know, I have so had it
<br>
with white people that if I had a vial of a killer virus
<br>
that would just wipe them all out, I'd break open that vial!&quot;
<br>
<p>So what would you say to her?  Scream at the top of your
<br>
lungs what an evil horrible mass-murdering racist she was?
<br>
Not I!  Since she had been so civil, as appalled as I might
<br>
be by the actual *event* (not recommendation --- a distinction
<br>
I have no problem keeping in mind), I would continue in the
<br>
same tone, saying, &quot;what would be accomplished by that?
<br>
think of the millions of *innocent* white people, what
<br>
logical arguments do you have for such an extreme view?,
<br>
do you really think that such a thing would be called for?&quot;.
<br>
<p>(And in fact, I did address some remarks to Robert about his
<br>
proposal in that tone.  I did not---and NEVER would---attempt
<br>
to make him feel like some kind of pariah.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [only my opinion; I'm just here for the waters]
</em><br>
<p>Well, please explain what else it could be besides
<br>
&quot;your opinion&quot;.  Logically, the alternatives scare
<br>
me---but then, I don't think that you are being
<br>
especially logical.
<br>
<p>Lee
