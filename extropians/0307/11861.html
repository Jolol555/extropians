<p>
I recall many discussions when I was previously on the list, with Robert 
<br>
taking the same position as he's taking now.  I'm not sure the debate has 
<br>
progressed any, and I know I don't have the time-stamina here now to talk 
<br>
on this for as long as such discussions usually go, but since many/most on 
<br>
the list now probably haven't read or don't recall all those old 
<br>
discussions, I'll quickly review my position.
<br>
<p>The key empirical puzzle is that we can do a decent job explaining 
<br>
*everything* we see beyond Earth using the hypothesis that it is all 
<br>
completely dead, and that life here was never influence by life 
<br>
elsewhere.  Of course there's a great deal that we cannot see, but there is 
<br>
also huge amount that we can see.  So if there is 
<br>
life/intelligence/civilization out there it isn't having much of an 
<br>
influence on the things we can see.
<br>
<p>This empirical fact is in conflict with theoretical expectations that 
<br>
life/etc typically looks different from death, that it tends to spread to 
<br>
available niches (which include the things we can see), and that with time 
<br>
it tends to become more &quot;advanced&quot; by accumulating innovations.  The more 
<br>
advanced it becomes, the easier it can spread and the more ability it has 
<br>
to look different from death.  It should have had billions of years to 
<br>
advance.  Many of us picture our descendants soon acquiring the ability to 
<br>
colonize the uncolonized universe and make a big impact on what it looks 
<br>
like.
<br>
<p>There are several ways to resolve this puzzle, though none of them seem 
<br>
particularly attractive.  There may be no life/etc out there, or it may all 
<br>
be primitive, so that life is extremely unlikely to make the transition to 
<br>
the advanced level at which we soon hope to be.  Contrary to all we think 
<br>
we know about physics, it may be physically very hard to spread, so that 
<br>
even very advanced life is effectively isolated.  Or perhaps advanced life 
<br>
or it spreading wasn't physically possible until very very 
<br>
recently.  Finally, the universe may be under the unified control of a very 
<br>
ancient advanced power which enforces a rule that implies that the sorts of 
<br>
things we can see must look dead.
<br>
<p>Robert Bradbury has proposed that advanced life naturally acquires 
<br>
preferences that make it want to become invisible and not want to 
<br>
spread.  It seems to me that in doing so Robert has taken his desires and 
<br>
projected them as the desire of most/all advanced life, and in the process 
<br>
fundamentally misunderstood evolution.  Short of a unified control over the 
<br>
universe there is simply no such thing as taking over evolution on the long 
<br>
timescale.  And given that evolution rules, the only natural preferences 
<br>
are those that result in the &quot;most&quot; progeny, regardless of other consequences.
