<br>
<em>&gt; Interesting point. I think this is part of the truth (I see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average mood of the computer science students at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Institute every day), but it is also a hint that we might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better off without &quot;fair weather extropians&quot;.  There was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological determinism-optimism of 90s transhumanism that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have come to think of as both naive and passivating.  It is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not dynamic optimism: it is passive optimism.  If the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity is coming and Wired is always right, what use is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there of doing anything except cheerleading? 
</em><br>
<p>This is the most important point that I think a few people have been
<br>
complaining about.  Some people have gotten so optimistic that they
<br>
become inactive.  Some people have literally argued against a Pluto
<br>
mission, claiming that Pluto will be turned into computronium before we
<br>
get there.  Some people have literally argued against cryonics saying we
<br>
will be immortal before we get old.  Some people have literally argued
<br>
against saving for retirement say that that the singularity will upload
<br>
us before we retire.  The sad truth is that many people are so confident
<br>
about the future that they won't lift a finger to do anything.  It turns
<br>
into a faith-based religion where real work is worthless and just
<br>
sitting back and doing nothing is the wisest course of action.
<br>
<p>People who complain about our slow progress, question whether things
<br>
will work, point out flaws in existing plans, etc., are the real heroes
<br>
of tomorrow.  They are the engineers of the future.  People who don't
<br>
know enough technology to see the flaws, or who are so optimistic that
<br>
they don't see any need to address the flaws, are the people who are
<br>
delaying progress.  Dynamic Optimism was never intended to be a
<br>
faith-based position.  We were supposed to be optimistic that everything
<br>
was possible so that we would continue working toward a solution while
<br>
others had long since given up.  Optimism should be an excuse to work
<br>
harder for the future, not an excuse to sit back and do nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dynamic optimism is about actually doing something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructive. Sure, the IT sector is not doing great. But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then we better invent new killer apps or find ways of using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the existing in better ways. With cheap programming labor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many new projects can be implemented that were too expensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before.  Cryonics doesn't work? Too bad, let's find another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution. People are not acknowledging Drexler in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology? Write papers that do. Investments went bad? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Start over, a bit more cautiously. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Biotech is under regulatory and luddite attack. So? Go out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and defend it! 
</em><br>
<p>Excellent advice!  I am seeing more and more people starting to question
<br>
our past irrational exuberance.  I hope that this will lead to a new
<br>
stage of increased activity and action.  Those who complain about
<br>
problems are not the enemy.  It is those who see no problems who are the
<br>
enemy.  The first stage in any technology or engineering project is to
<br>
identify the problem.  Only those who are dissatisfied with our current
<br>
progress will do better in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I found Dr. Bainbridge's talk at TransVision 03 very constructive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/articles_more.php?id=697_0_4_0_M">http://www.transhumanism.com/articles_more.php?id=697_0_4_0_M</a>
</em><br>
).  We are getting challenged, now we better respond. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Personally I am *more* optimistic about the transhuman future today
</em><br>
than
<br>
<em>&gt; I was just three years ago. We are finally starting to grow up. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Excellent article.  It is so close to my recent rants that reading it
<br>
gives me déjà vu.  I am glad that I am not the only one who feels like
<br>
we are either growing up or need to grow up.
