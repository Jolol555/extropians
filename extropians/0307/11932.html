<p><em>&gt; The aberration is temporary because DNA will soon be replaced by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster-changing forms of genes, including those you mention.
</em><br>
<p>Just to offer some related observations...
<br>
<p>- People would be very lucky to have 20 kids -- most humans throughout
<br>
evolutionary history died long before they could have raised that number.
<br>
<p>- Given the huge amount of junk DNA in mammalian genomes (and the
<br>
success of mammals over the last 60+ million years) and the fact
<br>
that the junk is mostly remnants of self-relocating genetic
<br>
elements that would happen to carry other genes along with
<br>
them (speeding up evolution) it would appear that there may be some
<br>
selective advantage for faster evolution.  We can't say for sure about
<br>
this since we don't have the genomes of say birds, reptiles or amphibians
<br>
(which have been around longer than mammals and have similar complexity).
<br>
<p>- *But* given the Fugu genome which is very old and relatively
<br>
small compared with mammals (it is a vertebrate so the complexity
<br>
should not be &quot;too&quot; different) it would appear evolution can
<br>
develop a means to interfere with the elements that would
<br>
naturally tend speed up evolution (how this is accomplished isn't
<br>
known at this time).
<br>
<p>- There has been proposed some interesting secondary effects in
<br>
evolution involved in nurturing (or promoting the survival of)
<br>
offspring [<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030717091254.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030717091254.htm</a>].
<br>
Similar effects may be promoting the development of &quot;ethical
<br>
behaviors&quot;.
<br>
<p>- Language (memes) seems to have played a role in speeding up
<br>
human evolution over the last 100,000+ years.  But one might
<br>
wonder whether memes and genes are not competing to see which
<br>
can drive evolution faster without completely driving the
<br>
carriers towards elimination.
<br>
<p>- At the simple chemical level DNA is not a terribly bad information
<br>
storage mechanism (compared with say a Drexlerian polymer tape,
<br>
e.g. Nanosystems sec. 12.6.4).  But I suspect that there may be
<br>
some interesting limits on the equipment that allows an ever
<br>
faster changing of genes/memes.  So the process seems unlikely
<br>
to continue indefinitely.
