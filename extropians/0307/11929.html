<em>&gt; &gt; I think so, too, and I sent a letter to that effect to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In any case, that strategy won't be very easy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In particular, the judges need to somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; swallow that cryonics is not a mere symptom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of pathetical delusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a matter of law, *why* do the judges need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow swallow that? Is pathetic delusion or its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere symptom itself now a crime. And if so which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the minority religious faiths and how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astrologers are there crowding French jails?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alas then, for the land of Voltaire and the birthplace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of *liberty*, equality, fraternity, when judges presume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to judge science or pre-judge scientific possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and set aside the principle that even fools that harm no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one by their eccentric choices should be denied their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to make such choices.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes. [You mean &quot;should not&quot;.]
<br>
<p>But, first, civil liberties in France are not as prioritary as they
<br>
are in the US. You know the famous quote by Voltaire regarding freedom
<br>
of speech: &quot;I totally disagree with you, but I will fight so that you
<br>
can express yourself.&quot;; well, in France you can be condemned if you
<br>
say that the number of Jews killed in WW II is X, rather than Y.
<br>
<p>Second, they are considered dead. I am not sure about how the
<br>
liberties of individuals are kept by &quot;them&quot; when they die in French
<br>
law. In any case, there is an administrative law (which is probably
<br>
not anti-constitutional) that says how dead bodies should be disposed
<br>
with, and it offers the choice between earth or fire, but not ice. And
<br>
such law settles the situation, seen from a magistrate. Again, it
<br>
regards DEAD bodies; so framing it in terms of individual liberties,
<br>
especially in a laic State (as Giulio rightly mentionned), may not
<br>
make much sense.
<br>
<p>HENCE, though not a lawyer myself, and not an expert of French law, I
<br>
think that one should show that cryonics has some plausibility, in
<br>
order to show that the administrative law that says how corpses are
<br>
disposed with is not the relevant juridical frame for the situation.
<br>
<p><p>(I add a post-scriptum on this, regarding the first point. Not being
<br>
French, when I first came here I was all vibrant against the
<br>
violations of individual liberties. Then I came to realize that there
<br>
is a tension between &quot;liberty&quot;, and &quot;equality and fraternity&quot;. The US
<br>
constitution is great on the first. The French is better on the two
<br>
last. Some restrictions of individual liberties do make sense in this
<br>
system, which has some good aspects.
<br>
<p>I won't debate that here, though. I just wanted to avoid a position of
<br>
saying: &quot;Yes! Of course you're right! French are fools! Everyone knows
<br>
that!&quot; I think they have followed a different path, coming from
<br>
Voltaire and the Revolution, which makes some sense. Liberalism is
<br>
good at redirecting competitive instinct into socially productive
<br>
behaviour. But the ideals of the French Revolution go beyond that.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Is there no organisation of civil libertarians in France?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are there no philosophers or lawyers students that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish to be famous and launch or rejuvenate their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careers in defence of an old principle of freedom even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when to do so would ensure that they would get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their names in the paper and a wealth of publicity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free?
</em><br>
<p><p>Not a bad idea. In Switzerland, I could more easily make such
<br>
connections (all the more so as my own father is a lawyer in
<br>
Geneva...). However, not here. I'll have a try to target such
<br>
population with such message.
<br>
<p>The problem being that points 1 and 2 above are obvious to anyone
<br>
here, and getting enthusiastic about defending liberties at whatever
<br>
cost doesn't make your audience shiver like it possibly does in the
<br>
US. People understand that taxes, for example, is a restriction of
<br>
individual liberty that is coherent with the last two thirds of the
<br>
republican trinity. As are the restrictions on freedom of speech on
<br>
the grounds of &quot;incitation à la haine raciale&quot; [incitement to racial
<br>
hatred]. Different cultural path, different tradition, for best and
<br>
worse.
<br>
