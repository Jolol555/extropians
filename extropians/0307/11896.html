<p>Life is made up of &quot;creatures&quot; that reproduce, and &quot;genes&quot; are whatever 
<br>
physically codes for their behavior that is passed on to 
<br>
descendants.  Reproduction is part of a creature's behavior, and so a 
<br>
creatures genes says how it reproduces.  Most animal's genes are in their 
<br>
DNA.  Some human genes are now found in human culture.  With uploads making 
<br>
copies, genes will reside in upload memories and other mental structures.
<br>
<p>DNA genes now say whether a creature reproduces sexually or asexually, and 
<br>
whether the mutation rate increases in response to recent environmental 
<br>
stress.  Genes tell humans which kind of partners they want to mate with 
<br>
and when in their lives to do it.  For Lamarkian creatures, genes would 
<br>
tell them how to change their genes in response to the environment they 
<br>
experience.  All of these seem to be examples of &quot;self-directed evolution&quot;, 
<br>
in the sense that aspects of reproduction are coded for within a creature.
<br>
<p>The heart of evolution is variation and selection.  And given sufficient 
<br>
variation, the key is the selective pressures.  In the examples above 
<br>
&quot;self-directed evolution&quot; does not reduce the strong ability of selection 
<br>
pressure to mold creatures.  What kind of &quot;&quot;self-directed evolution&quot; do you 
<br>
have in mind that could do differently?
<br>
<p>If all life on Earth came under the control of a single power, that power 
<br>
might control who lived and who died, and so direct selection pressure 
<br>
toward its chosen ends.  But even then, if that single power does not 
<br>
control the rest of the universe, it may eventually have to complete with 
<br>
powers elsewhere, and selection can still determine how much of the 
<br>
universe becomes like that Earth power.
