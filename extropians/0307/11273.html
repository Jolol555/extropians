Oh, wait, apparently Lee *did* post this to the Extropians list, instead 
<br>
of just to me... no wonder I couldn't find it in my inbox.  OK, I'll try 
<br>
and straighten this out on-list.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;   that a child will be born with deformities if its mother had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;   rubella during her pregnancy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this stupid problem, the authors badly misstate at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the premises, in my opinion.  If you draw a picture of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, perhaps, you may be less likely to misread it than if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you plug the numbers into a formula.
</em><br>
<p>No, Lee, it's perfectly straightforward to solve the problem from these 
<br>
premises.
<br>
<p>Observe:
<br>
<p>p(deformity) = 0.01
<br>
p(~deformity) = 0.99
<br>
p(rubella|~deformity) = 0.1
<br>
p(rubella|deformity) = 0.5
<br>
p(rubella&amp;~deformity) = p(r|~d)p(~d) = .1*.99 = .099
<br>
p(rubella&amp;deformity) = p(r|d)p(d) = .5*.01 = .005
<br>
p(rubella) = p(r&amp;d) + p(r&amp;~d) = .104
<br>
p(deformity|rubella) = p(rubella&amp;deformity)/p(rubella) = .005/.104 = .048
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the heresy P(AB) is not equal to P(A|B)*P(B) appears in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote from the above paper:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       In Germany, every expectant mother must have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       obligatory test for rubella infection because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       children born to women who have rubella while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       pregnant are often born with terrible deformities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       The following information is at your disposal:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         The probability that a newborn will have deformities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         traceable to a sickness of its mother during pregnancy is 1%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         If a child is born healthy and normal, the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         that the mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 10%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         If a child is born with deformities and it can be traced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         to some sickness of the mother, the probability that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 50%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         What is the probability that a child will be born with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         deformities if its mother had rubella during her pregnancy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       The Bayesian solution p (H | D) is .048.  But participants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       who use one of two non-Bayesian algorithms, computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       p (H&amp;D) = .005 or picking p (H) = .01, will produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       estimates that lie in the interval of ±5 percentage points
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       around the Bayesian solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why shouldn't p(H&amp;D) --- that is, p(defect &amp; rubella) be equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to .005?  What other conclusion can one come to from the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement together with the third statement?
</em><br>
<p>p(H&amp;D) DOES come to .005.  It's just this is the WRONG SOLUTION to the 
<br>
problem.  Sedlmeier and Gigerenzer are not saying that p(H&amp;D) != 0.005, 
<br>
they're saying that p(H&amp;D) != p(H|D).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unless, they fail to believe that p(H&amp;D) = p(H|D)*p(D).  Sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, go back a couple of paragraphs in that paper, and find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       The most frequent non-Bayesian algorithms they identified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       include computing p (H&amp;D) by multiplying p (H) and p (D | H);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No wonder I can't grasp Bayesianism.   ;-)
</em><br>
<p>It may not be a good idea to read academic papers about Bayes before 
<br>
having grasped Bayes, since the authors are speaking to an audience that 
<br>
they need not fear confusing.  When they speak of non-Bayesian algorithms 
<br>
they are NOT talking about formal statistical methods employed by 
<br>
self-declared frequentists; they are talking about naive subjects 
<br>
computing a wrong answer using a bad visualization of the problem.  That 
<br>
is, &quot;non-Bayesian&quot; is here a synonym for &quot;incorrect&quot;, not &quot;frequentist&quot;. 
<br>
They are not talking about the frequentist/Bayesian controversy at all.
<br>
<p>If you look at the surrounding context, you will see that the problem they 
<br>
are addressing is that some incorrect answers computed according to common 
<br>
incorrect strategies are numerically close to the correct answer, and 
<br>
might be confused with a &quot;Bayesian&quot; answer by some common experimental 
<br>
techniques that accept answers as &quot;Bayesian&quot; if they are within a given 
<br>
range of the correct answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, it is a libel to say that Bayesians would be guilty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing that p(H&amp;D) was not equal to p(H|D)*p(D).  But I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hoping that it would turn out to be the case that in some problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do not---now I simply believe that the authors are full of shit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I think that their study is deeply flawed too, as a predictable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of inflicting this problem on a lot of innocent victims.
</em><br>
<p>Lee, Gigerenzer is extremely unlikely (prior probability) to be full of 
<br>
shit.  I haven't heard of Sedlmeier, but I've heard of Gigerenzer.  If you 
<br>
are confused about a mathematical subject and you find yourself 
<br>
disagreeing with a pro mathematician it is diamonds to doughnuts that you 
<br>
are the one in the wrong.
<br>
<p>I would (as stated more briefly in my first reply) recommend that you read 
<br>
through the &quot;Intuitive Explanation&quot; from start to finish without skipping 
<br>
anything; and then, if you are still interested in understanding the 
<br>
difference between Bayesians and frequentists (which is something the 
<br>
intro does not address), I would recommend reading the E.T. Jaynes 
<br>
lectures given in the &quot;Further Reading&quot; section at the end of the intro. 
<br>
Jaynes gives specific examples of cases where frequentist methods are both 
<br>
more complicated than and inferior to Bayesian methods.
