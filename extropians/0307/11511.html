<p>
Various authors have attempted to derive a rational
<br>
defense of honesty with little success.  David
<br>
Friedman, son of Milton, authored an article years ago
<br>
in which he postulated that the natural costs of
<br>
dishonesty - having to expend extra energy to deceive
<br>
ones victims - made it cost ineffective and therefore
<br>
irrational.  David also gave a parallel argument for
<br>
not lane switching in traffic some years before that
<br>
at a local S. CA libertarian supper club.
<br>
<p>With the same fallacy:  Sure, if everyone practices
<br>
lane switching in heavy traffic, then there will be a
<br>
net loss in travel efficiency.  And, if the average
<br>
driver attempts to improve his travel time by lane
<br>
switching, then he will find that he gains little for
<br>
his efforts in competition with the other lane
<br>
switchers who will also move into the faster lane
<br>
until it becomes the slow lane.  All pretty obvious
<br>
and straightforward and almost utterly worthless as an
<br>
argument to convince anyone of anything.  \
<br>
<p>Becuz:  Your typical driver is too lazy to expend
<br>
effort on what is clearly a waste.  Perhaps a few
<br>
hyper types will do so anyway out of frustration, as
<br>
well as a few really stupid people, but the drivers
<br>
who lane switch will tend to be those who have found
<br>
over time that they personally can do so successfully
<br>
- or so it seems to them, anyway.  And, for some of
<br>
them, this will be true.  Better drivers with faster
<br>
reflexes and better eyesight and higher cabs to see
<br>
from and more experience in judging lane prospects
<br>
will tend to win out by lane switching, over drunken
<br>
senile octegenarians with a cold and cataracts taking
<br>
flu medicine and running on short sleep (and they ARE
<br>
out there ;) ).  Some people do gain by lane switching
<br>
and do so reliably.
<br>
<p>Similarly, some people will be on the high end of the
<br>
curve for criminal capabilities and they will profit
<br>
greatly by being dishonest, criminal, hypocritical,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>The other pro-honesty arguments based on internal
<br>
consistency, etc., were nicely dealt with by Xerene
<br>
and Strackon in Invictus in the late '60's, when they
<br>
systematically took them on and showed them all to be
<br>
silly or religious.
<br>
<p>However, there is another factor:
<br>
<p>Psychological visibility is itself highly valuable and
<br>
desireable, as exemplified in how much effort people
<br>
put into relationships that provide it.  People are
<br>
known to be willing to risk or even give their lives
<br>
for love.  Psychological visibility, feedback,
<br>
perceptual reaffirmation, etc. are a key source of
<br>
pleasure as well as a cornerstone of sanity.  Other
<br>
people are the only real mirror of your consciousness
<br>
(with the caveat that lower animals - dogs, for
<br>
example - can provide this feedback up to a point).
<br>
<p>So, let's just throw a monkeywrench into the whole
<br>
process by which we get all that, by injecting the
<br>
element of dishonesty.  The original dishonesty is not
<br>
really that important in general.  Rather, it is the
<br>
ongoing need to cloak oneself, to monitor ones
<br>
expressions, to screen out aspects of ones behavior,
<br>
beliefs, etc, to exert a cognitive, conceptual filter
<br>
on the very channel that is supposed to bypass the
<br>
conceptual and provide an emotional grounding in real
<br>
perceptual, emotional responses.
<br>
<p>This is devastating over time and a very high price to
<br>
pay for dishonesty in general.
<br>
<p>Now, the problem is that we have learned - a la Freud
<br>
/ Judeo-Christianity - as a culture that we are born
<br>
with original sin.  We are NOT supposed to let it hang
<br>
out.  It's just not PC.  Anymore.  It used to be in
<br>
the late '60's, '70's, early '80's in certain
<br>
subcultures, such as those influenced by Wilhelm Reich
<br>
or Nathaniel Brandon.  Now we are much more back into
<br>
the '50's style - hypocrisy as a way of life.  Fashion
<br>
uber alles.
<br>
<p>There is a certain thrill to creating a persona to
<br>
order.  The 3-piece suit, with the little hidden
<br>
pocket for the coke stash.  Screwing over good people
<br>
and forcing them to thank you for it.  Derivative
<br>
thrills abound in the spiral away from the real.  But
<br>
sociopathology has its natural dead end and limits,
<br>
and is, at last analysis, simply a form of cowardice,
<br>
a fundamental surrender of life.
<br>
<p>With the caveat that sometimes (all too often in our
<br>
control-freak culture) that price is still lower than
<br>
the alternative.  As in, being honest about one's
<br>
Jewish ancestry in NAZI Germany.  How sad when we
<br>
force people to give up what makes life enjoyable and
<br>
fulfilling in order to survive.  But then, that's been
<br>
the name of the religious/statist power game for a
<br>
LONG time.
