<p>Reasonable question.  I don't think it requires too much thinking
<br>
to get some approximations.  [I point out some of this in [1]; Mez
<br>
subsequently qualified it].
<br>
<p>But an easy ballpark estimate (for the U.S.) is that if you are
<br>
dealing with 16,000 lives per year from drunk drivers [2] and something
<br>
less than ~1000 lives per year (for the last three years) from
<br>
terrorism then drunk driving should be more than 10x the concern
<br>
of terrorism.
<br>
<p>But I would doubt that in terms of the allocation of budget
<br>
dollars that would seem to be the case.  [And Emlyn --
<br>
don't even talk to me about AU -- terrorism deaths --
<br>
considering the incident in Bali are probably something
<br>
like a hundred or so per year -- based on a several year
<br>
average -- and I'd hate to consider what the Driving Under
<br>
the Influence stats would be.]
<br>
<p>But the point is well taken -- as was the case with SARS we have
<br>
a situation where some of the potential impacts cause a much greater
<br>
notice than others.  What we should be looking for is a rational
<br>
scale and some way of presenting it.  From my (extropic?) perspective
<br>
the greater the risk to humanity, the greater should be the perceived
<br>
risk from a hazard.
