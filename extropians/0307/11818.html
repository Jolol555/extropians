<p>Ok.  I thought you may have been taunting Eliezer for

a &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; defence. I wouldn't have minded 
<br>
seeing that myself  ;-)
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a difficult issue.  My partial solution is to argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that death, as an event, is culturally determined, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask that our view be given as much consideration as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;death is inevitable/desirable&quot; view, under the auspice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the prevailing pluralism in society.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Avoiding senescence would be a choice and a choice that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply to all humanity (the &quot;millions of lives will be lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless we cure aging&quot; mentality). 
</em><br>
<p>I agree that the line on &quot;millions of lives will be lost unless
<br>
we cure aging&quot; is not one that will play well politically. Not
<br>
against a background of nations in conflict and when people
<br>
are still starving, dying of cancer, aids, etc. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own hope is that the  tension between wanting to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the word out, to secure funding, etc, and wanting a morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defensible exclusionary practise (so we don't just seem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a bunch of arrogant Westerners who want to live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever while half the world is starving) will be alleviated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply by elucidating our position.
</em><br>
<p>I think one can have a morally defensible exclusionary practice
<br>
in effect by having an opt-in trigger which many will chose 
<br>
freely not to take. In this way all are invited to share in the
<br>
vision but not all will choose to.  And some will hold the view
<br>
that the current present can give birth to a variety of alternate
<br>
futures and they prefer 'their' vision to 'ours' and be willing to
<br>
compete hard to secure what they see as the more preferably
<br>
mutually exclusive outcome. 
<br>
<p>Realising goals requires resources and in a contingent universe
<br>
the same resource cannot be simultaneously alternatively 
<br>
deployed. (Though supernaturalists in government will often 
<br>
attempt to underwrite rights with a currency of resources that 
<br>
don't actually exist. Eg. The human rights some would ascribe
<br>
to embryos -potential persons - can only be purchased at a 
<br>
reduced capacity to resource the health of sick people - actual
<br>
persons.) This makes any actions aimed at putting particular 
<br>
visions or forging particular futures with social resources 
<br>
inherently political. And there are no resources, including 
<br>
private property, that modern political systems will not regard
<br>
as at least potentially available for redistribution and 
<br>
redeployment.
