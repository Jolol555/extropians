Morris,
<br>
<p>Let me clear up a bit of misinformation ...
<br>
<p><p>On 2003.07.06, Extropian Agroforestry Ventures Inc. &lt;<a href="mailto:megao@sasktel.net?Subject=Re:%20making%20the%20most%20of%20site%20visitor%20information">megao@sasktel.net</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt; Along the way I have captured a list of visitors to my site that
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Unfortunately, it's an easy question with an answer of 'no'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A user's email address is not in any way linked with their IP address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or the hostname that IP resolves to.
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, the answer is &quot;yes, but it's not easy and it's not cheap.&quot;
<br>
<p>(Remember, there are very few things that are truly impossible --
<br>
improbable, sure ... but not impossible.)
<br>
<p>There are information clearinghouses out there who sell access to large
<br>
databases containing all sorts of goodies.  Things that tie people's
<br>
vital stats (name, birthdate, etc.) to their credit reports and debts,
<br>
marketing demographics, etc.
<br>
<p>Someone got smart along the way and said, &quot;Hey, we could tag people's
<br>
browsers with cookies and other tracking nonsense and then wait for them
<br>
to self-identify (at an e-commerce site, for example) then correlate
<br>
them back to the rest of their data ...&quot;
<br>
<p>This information is golden and powerful and isn't easy to get and
<br>
expensive.  But, imagine if you were a marketing droid, what you
<br>
wouldn't give to get at this kind of data ...
<br>
<p>Of course, some feel this might be an invasion of privacy and ought to
<br>
be illegal (and in some cases, it actually is) ... and some folks think
<br>
people who USE this data are even more scummy.  Unlike spam which
<br>
affects you directly and consciously ... people knowing who you are and
<br>
what websites you're visiting and what email addresses you use are a lot
<br>
more subtle, so fewer people know about it happening.
<br>
<p><p>I can't really say much more than this, but I'm showing you the door.
<br>
Which pill you take is entirely up to you.
<br>
