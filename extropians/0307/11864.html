<p>
When I was a teen, I used to tell my friends that the
<br>
sun wasn't really where they thought it was.  When they
<br>
evinced surprise, I proudly announced that it really was
<br>
two degrees to the west of where it looked like it was,
<br>
or about four sun-diameters.
<br>
<p>I explained that this was (of course) because the light
<br>
took eight minutes to reach us, and so the sun's real
<br>
position was two degrees to the right (looking from the
<br>
Northern hemisphere).
<br>
<p>None of them spotted the flaw in my logic :-)  and it may
<br>
take a few on this list a moment or two to see where I was
<br>
going wrong.
<br>
<p>Anyway, it seems that Laplace *did* correctly determine
<br>
that where the sun is as measured by a sensitive gravimeter
<br>
is not the same place that it looks like it is.  There is a
<br>
very nice exercise in &quot;Problem Book in Relativity and
<br>
Gravitation&quot;, Lightman, Press, Price, and Teukolsky:
<br>
<p>&quot;The position of the sun in the sky can in principle be
<br>
measured by a sensitive tidal gravimeter.  What is the
<br>
angular difference between this position and its position
<br>
as measured optically?  If the actual position of the sun
<br>
were at its optical position, there would be a force in
<br>
the direction of the Earth's motion.  If this were the case
<br>
find the radius of the Earth's orbit as a function of time.&quot;
<br>
<p>The answer has something to do with the aberration of light,
<br>
as I understand it.  If the Earth is going 66,000 miles per
<br>
hour (30 km/sec) past the sun, then the sun appears slightly
<br>
shifted towards the forward direction.  That makes sense.
<br>
<p>So what I infer from this problem is that *gravitationally*
<br>
it isn't so!  The gravity waves don't lie!  There must not
<br>
be anything like &quot;aberration of gravitons&quot;.  (This thought
<br>
is also what lent me credence in my earlier post that perhaps
<br>
the frame of reference of the space-bending (i.e. gravitating)
<br>
object is the correct frame of reference to use.  Mostly?
