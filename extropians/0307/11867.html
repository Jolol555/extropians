<br>
<p><em>&gt; The stability of massive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stars is not dependent on the speed of gravity since it is a static 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property (some complications for truly massive stars where relativistic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instability forces them to oscillate). When a star collapses to a black 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole it does so when the mass concentration inside a region becomes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger than the Schwarzchild criterion; you could compress it or add 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass very slowly and still get a quick &quot;schlurp&quot; once the last atom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broke spacetime's back. 
</em><br>
<p>Why do you believe in black holes?  The only way that the
<br>
math yields such things is through transforms that ultimately
<br>
yield singularities (which should have been enough to convince
<br>
people that the use of such mathematical transformations is
<br>
extremely suspect).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (event horizons, being somewhat virtual and arbitrary things, can &quot;move&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster than light, such as when a non-axisymmetric black hole relaxes. 
</em><br>
<p>We don't need to worry about it, if there aren't black holes.
<br>
<p>I am not a crackpot.  :-)  Consider the situation with an open
<br>
mind: we know from the Schwarzchild view that (in effect) the
<br>
passage of time slows near heavy mass concentrations.  This
<br>
might be worthless mathematical arcanae were it not for the
<br>
convenient fact that indeed, just exactly as predicted from the
<br>
use of the S equations and S coordinates, atomic events on the
<br>
sun and on other massive bodies do proceed more slowly.
<br>
<p>So now imagine a body 2.5 times more massive than the sun---
<br>
as it contracts, events begin to proceed VERRRRRY slowly, and
<br>
a gigantic case of stellar constipation obtains.  Near the
<br>
center, it takes practically forever for anything to happen.
<br>
<p>(So the Russian theorists, I claim, were right about &quot;frozen
<br>
stars&quot;, and people in the sixties just fell under Wheeler's
<br>
mesmerism, and began to think that black holes *already*
<br>
existed, instead of happening only after infinitely much
<br>
time has elapsed, and *only* if the object does not evaporate
<br>
---(it is thought by Hawking and others that these alleged
<br>
black holes eventually evaporate)).
<br>
<p>My revisionist view then goes like this:  since it takes
<br>
practically forever for anything to happen in the center of
<br>
a collapsed star, some *people* got impatient, and subjected
<br>
the whole mess to a Kruskal-Szekeres transformation, and 
<br>
voila, we obtain some much more interesting and racy phenomena
<br>
in the new coordinates.
<br>
<p>Never mind that the variable t referring to ordinary time needs
<br>
to take on transfinite values---why should that stop a physicist
<br>
with too much imagination, tenure, and too little common sense?
<br>
It is so joyful to BELIEVE in black holes and singularities, event 
<br>
horizons, and all that fun stuff, never mind if they're real
<br>
or not, or whether even after 10^10^10^10^10 years we'd ever
<br>
actually have one.
