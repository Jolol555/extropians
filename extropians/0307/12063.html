John B writes (and I also greatly appreciated Brett's and Randall's
<br>
further analyses)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ramez writes                                                                  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think a good place to search for past examples of this is in              
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; espionage.  What little I know of the field leads me to believe that a      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; great many spies have been in \&quot;deep cover\&quot; for years at a time without    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; switching allegiances.  Or at least, that's how it is in the spy            
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; movies and books. :)                                                        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt; Sorry, gotta disagree. There are SOME similarities, but I have to agree   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Randall's earlier post that there're some critical differences between a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trained agent provocateur with a support mechanism, a person in this          
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictional position, and the subjects of brainwashing efforts.                           
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A trained agent is given information about the situation that the other two   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack...they are generally well-balanced professionals...and are often           
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologically prepared or selected... for proper ideological structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even so, there are stories of people 'going native' or cracking under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stress of such a prolonged mental and emotional effort.                                                
</em><br>
<p>These are all excellent points, IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The kids, however, do NOT have a strong motivation other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than those provided by the staff [and] do NOT have high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees of acting/lying skill. They do NOT have anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to vent to except by increasing the pressure on others in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the program.                                                                      
</em><br>
<p>One feature of the difference that seems more salient than
<br>
ever to me now is the inherent differences in ability between
<br>
people in terms of acting or portrayal.  I think that it was
<br>
easy for me from a very young age to control my apparent
<br>
reactions (though probably not so well as I imagined).  By
<br>
the age of these teens, I---like a number of people here and
<br>
who I know---would have been easily able to outwardly comply
<br>
*without* becoming brainwashed.  But I am forcibly reminded
<br>
that not all kids are this way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They do NOT have a strong core of personal values - they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still working on 'em,
</em><br>
<p>Again, that is only for some of them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; and that one 'record-holding' girl is the exception which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proves the point, and even SHE folded in the end.
</em><br>
<p>Or learned.  (And I do mean learn without having truly
<br>
changed her feelings and thoughts inside.)
<br>
<p>So then we have three classes of kids as I see it:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1A  -  those with values who can diplomatically or conveniently
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pretend otherwise
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1B  -  those with values who can not or will not (that amazing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;girl
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2   -  those---especially who are much younger---without well-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;established identities or personalities, or even values.
<br>
<p>Now I don't think that the latter type 2 kids ever get sent to
<br>
a reform school like Tranquility Bay, except in rare and pathological
<br>
cases where the problems really and truly arose only in the parents
<br>
(I had better depict this, below, before someone jumps on it).
<br>
<p>So we have the 1A kids, who perhaps quickly learn that there is
<br>
no ready recourse except to feign obedience (which we may charitably
<br>
assume is all that is required in the better camps).  One wonders
<br>
what would happen if all the readers of this list were sent there
<br>
tomorrow, (in young bodies, say) along with dossiers detailing the
<br>
very worst behavior.  What percentage of us would end up &quot;lying on
<br>
our faces&quot; for any extended period of time?  The remarkable 1B girl
<br>
is still central to my puzzlement.
<br>
<p>The kind of parents---really few in number, I think---that I was
<br>
thinking of are those who are *never* satisfied with their children's
<br>
behavior, and project their own problems onto others (or especially
<br>
their kids) at every opportunity.  The classic case is the father 
<br>
who's had a bad day and so kicks the dog.  The parents I was speaking
<br>
of in that paragraph are those who would be unsatisfied by the behavior
<br>
of 99% of actual kids, and would feel a need to do something radical
<br>
in every case.
