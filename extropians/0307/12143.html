<em>&gt; ..when acting on knowledge of probabilities in a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral or immoral....
</em><br>
<p>[brett] I was not meaning to say, as you seem to be here, that
<br>
acting or anticipating the actions of others (especially 
<br>
when the actions of others are likely to be serious even
<br>
lethal) that one is necessarily operating outside of a 
<br>
moral sphere. Quite to the contrary I was trying, perhaps, 
<br>
not very effectively, to make the point that as subjective indivduals 
<br>
*all* of our judgements must necessarily be finally self-centric, 
<br>
including our *moral* judgements. 
<br>
<p>[brett] Therefore, it follows to me, almost as day must follow night, 
<br>
that whatever else one's moral system might incorporate, it *cannot*, 
<br>
(if it is to be consistent and to have utility in guiding our actions
<br>
and 
<br>
serving as a basis from which we might seek to form compacts with each
<br>
other) not incorporate the recognition that we must be honest with 
<br>
ourselves. I'm arguing that moral action is precluded, that one cannot
<br>
be 
<br>
acting morally if one is not acting on one's own best comprehension of 
<br>
the situation.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I think we're discussing two seperate points (again!); I was merely
<br>
stating that in my opinion, anybody who says the statement that they are
<br>
acting morally in a pre-emptive fashion that harms others, regardless of
<br>
the effect, is immoral; insofar as no event has occurred to justify said
<br>
&quot;response&quot;.  In relation to your secondary point (stated in this
<br>
letter);
<br>
I really don't think morality has anything necessarily to do with 
<br>
self-delusion, or the acknowledgement thereof.  Or rather, there is
<br>
no truth that states necessarily you have to be honest, ergo an act of
<br>
dishonesty (as it relates to self-delusion) does not violate any
<br>
particularly
<br>
great truth.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;Or to put it more bluntly, sometimes self-delusion is the ticket :)
<br>
Ever wonder why (evolutionary-speaking) we have emotions?
<br>
<p>[brett]Now against this point it might be argued that there
<br>
are no circumstances where dishonesty with oneself is
<br>
a moral matter. I conceed that this is the traditional view
<br>
but my contention is that that traditional view is wrong, flawed, and
<br>
lacking in utility. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; fair enough, I'll bite :)
<br>
<p>[brett]I am arguing that only those that can commit themselves
<br>
to hold themselves to a rational moral code are in a 
<br>
position to have the sort of maturity that is required to 
<br>
forge the sort of compacts that will best serve the 
<br>
strongest forms of cooperatives and the most extropic societies.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; substitute &quot;ethics&quot; in for &quot;morality&quot; and I'ld agree;
<br>
morality to be is something generally provided for people
<br>
by external sources (rather than derived by said people);
<br>
it also deals heavily with intention.  Now, I *really* don't
<br>
care what people's intentions are, just their actions.  Intention
<br>
are more of a heuristic to decide whether or not someone's
<br>
future actions will be favorable.   This discussion could all
<br>
be simplified by people adopting a non-intention based 
<br>
system, where people are judged by their actions, and statements
<br>
made by said people are evaluated in that context (as actions).
<br>
<p>[brett]I do not imagine that any of us ultimately succeeds in
<br>
avoiding self delusion. But if the charge of hyper-rationality 
<br>
is ever a valid criticism I do not think it can be so on 
<br>
matters of morality where the individuals concerned 
<br>
acknowledge that their take on the universe is inherently 
<br>
subjective and inherently selfish. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I think there are degrees of self-delusion; I think
<br>
more important than self-delusion is the end effect that 
<br>
self-delusion has on the person as a total system.
<br>
<p>[brett]It is my contention that
<br>
if we cannot find a harmony of selfish interests we will
<br>
not find anything but the illusion of harmony at all. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; in other words, someplace where everyones needs
<br>
are met... 
<br>
<p>[brett]And in order for their to be a harmony of selfish interests 
<br>
their must be real recognition of the nature of oneself 
<br>
and ones needs. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; or a mapping of sensory input to available physical stimulus.
<br>
thats another possibility, sans recognition of one's own selfish
<br>
interests.  Same goes for empaths (people with highly developed
<br>
abilities to sense what others are feeling off of physical [body,
<br>
speech] cues).  They intuitively understand people and respond
<br>
sans a specific rational understanding of those people.  There's
<br>
no reason (any empaths out there?) to think that emotion-intuition
<br>
is not being applied to themselves (the equivalent of reflection).
<br>
<p>[Brett]This is where I think it becomes important
<br>
to acknowledge to oneself that one can be rational and 
<br>
that one is by nature social. If one does not acknowledge 
<br>
that one is social one is not (by my reckoning) being true
<br>
to oneself and one does not have the sort of maturity 
<br>
that will enable one to be on good terms with oneself
<br>
and to form real compacts that have a chance of being
<br>
honored with others. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;Ooooh I don't know about that :)  You seem to take
<br>
that people are by nature, social creatures.  I don't
<br>
necessarily think thats the case. Or to qualify, people are
<br>
social by a matter of degree.  Some are quite capable
<br>
of going it alone while others would die if seperated
<br>
from the herd.  So i question ur assumption that everyone
<br>
is social.... Its obviously a core belief in ur system, and certes,
<br>
generally speaking, it is the case that most people are social.
<br>
But not all.
<br>
<p>[brett]If there was a creature that by nature was not social in
<br>
any sense I would grant by my notion of morality that
<br>
that creature would have no duties to others and that
<br>
that creature would not be acting immorally in anything
<br>
it did to others.  If one is sure that one is being 
<br>
threatened by a genuine sociopath by my moral reckoning
<br>
one would not only be permitted to act in ones defence
<br>
one would be morally obliged. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; see now I wouldn't go that far; just because ur being
<br>
threatened by a sociopath does not necessarily mean they
<br>
will carry out that act;  there's a whole subset of sociopaths
<br>
that lead &quot;normal&quot; lives without going through the murder
<br>
sprees that characterize their (by our definitions) 
<br>
less-successful brethern.  I think thats more of a policy issue
<br>
(to be decided upon by each individual)....
<br>
<p>[brett]In practise I would have some residual doubts about
<br>
the completeness of the sociopathy of even a creature
<br>
such as Hitler so I would not feel completely free to 
<br>
exterminate him with extreme prejudice unless I had
<br>
made a good faith reckoning as to the nature of him 
<br>
as a threat to what I value. Then having made a 
<br>
best a rational determination of the nature of the threat
<br>
as I could given the time and context I would feel free
<br>
to exterminate him with exteme prejudice and I 
<br>
would expect to feel no guilt but only some misgivings
<br>
that had I more time I might have judged better. ie.
<br>
My concept of morality is I think in that sense
<br>
practical. And it is extensible. If others share it,
<br>
if they act rationally and in accordance with their selfish
<br>
&nbsp;best interests as they perceive it I can (in the context) 
<br>
of this moral system have not fault them morally.  
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; now don't u see a contradiction therein? What if
<br>
the sociopath, or even loony person (to broaden the set),
<br>
is merely acting to fulfill his own utility (ergo munching
<br>
on ur spleen or the like)?  I mean, just because someone
<br>
else is &quot;selfishly&quot; (is their any other way?!) pursuing
<br>
there own interests, doesn't necessarily mean ur own
<br>
moral code should approve their own...
<br>
<p>[Paul]
<br>
<em>&gt; Pretty much the only time u can consider something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral or immoral is after the event has occurred, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, only for urself.  Morality has absolutely no import
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a pre-emptive doctrine.
</em><br>
<p>[brett]I don't agree. By my reckoning of morality, when 
<br>
individuals agree to cooperate with each other for their
<br>
mutual advantage (perhaps at some cost to them on
<br>
other dimensions were they reckoning their best
<br>
interests separately) there is a moral bond between
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; according to ur definition of morality :)
<br>
<p>[Paul]
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyone that believes to the contrary has not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationally examined the situation.
</em><br>
<p>[brett]To be frank, I am doubtful that the word belief can
<br>
be validly coupled (except as crude linguistic 
<br>
shorthand for &quot;this is my operating hypothesis&quot;) with
<br>
a rational examination of  any situation. Belief is often
<br>
used by fairly rational people in just this short hand
<br>
manner.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; belief =&gt; a statement a rational agent holds true. 
<br>
<p>[Brett] By the code of morality I have tried to
<br>
describe, belief qua belief is immoral. This is because
<br>
when one is believing one is not reasoning and when
<br>
one is not reasoning to the route of ones selfish best
<br>
interest one is groping with a less than optimal method. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; depends on how u define it :) And certes, just because
<br>
you believe something doesn't necessarily make it false
<br>
(or ill-advised); classic example, I believe the sun will
<br>
rise tomorrow morning...  Of course the veracity of that
<br>
statement will require observation tomorrow morning; but
<br>
the belief is both advisable and statistically speaking,
<br>
fairly certain...  In other words, belief and logic
<br>
are not necessarily at odds; it depends on how you define
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>[brett]My contention is that as soon as one becomes
<br>
a &quot;believer&quot; one has ceased to hold to the principle
<br>
of to thine own self be true - unless one is incapable
<br>
of reasoning - (or one must reach a tenatative 
<br>
conclusion based on the imperative to live and
<br>
act in real time). 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; hahahaha :) re - ur last qualification :)
<br>
well since we're all stuck in this current universe... :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Generally speaking, I have no use for morality;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just ethics [standard api, consistently adhered to, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logically derived, based on reality]....
</em><br>
<p>[brett]I'm reading api as 'application programming interface'. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; yuppers.
<br>
<p>[brett]&quot;Generally speaking&quot; I suspect you are unlikely to 
<br>
enjoy discussing morality and/or ethics much further
<br>
with me ;-)
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; it doesn't really bother me, if thats what u're asking :)
<br>
but I've pretty much made up my ethical system, at least
<br>
in terms of the larger ruleset (meta-rules)... 
<br>
some of the smaller &quot;behaviors&quot; are data-driven  
<br>
(tit-for-tat, etc) :)
<br>
<p>[brett]I may make a real balls up of communicating what 
<br>
I am saying in an interesting way but I have given
<br>
the issue of morality some thought. I think it is an 
<br>
important topic. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; certes, I'll completely agree with that; morality
<br>
(or ethics as I prefer) is a very important topic...
