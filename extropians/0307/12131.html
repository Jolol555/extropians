</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If high paying skilled manufacturing jobs

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concern of the federal government because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deals in not just the long term economic stability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the nation, but its political stability as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Even worse, a government that allows the export
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of not just its high paying manufacturing jobs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overseas, but its higher paying knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; jobs overseas is asking for only one possible result:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the reinstitution of feudalism, because all that will be

<em>&gt; &gt; left are wealthy stockholders and lots and lots of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; burger flippers and blue jeans sales people, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; garbage collectors, etc etc etc. i.e. an aristocracy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of educated elites and a majority of uneducated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and unskilled wage slaves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is not what libertarianism is about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I respect that you are active on the libertarian front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike and know from the list your views on certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas such as right to bear arms, gm labelling, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free state project etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you briefly and positively describe what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarianism *is* about in your view.  How do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see libertarianism in relation to globalism and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global economy and law? The notion of a free state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for instance can be looked at from two different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standpoints. One could be that the personal liberties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one would like to be able to take for granted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a citizen as ones birthright are not being respected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that as a consequence the best practical way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get them respected is to come together with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likeminded others and form a state. But is the aim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that state to keep the rest of the world out or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the aim of that state to create a building space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which to live free and demonstrate a principle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that that principles held by that state can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended further?
</em><br>
<p>The aim of the state is to create a protected space in which high trust
<br>
institutions can develop and where individuals can learn to live high
<br>
trust lifestyles and live with high trust attitudes toward their fellow
<br>
man. Only within such a plenum can a libertarian society develop and
<br>
remain stable. Free trade is a fine goal, as is free immigration, but
<br>
such policies should only be permitted between similarly high trust
<br>
societies.
<br>
<p>Look, for example, at the European Union (no example of a libertarian
<br>
society, but far better than most of the world). Immigration between
<br>
member states is pretty wide open now, because all such member states
<br>
have attained some degree of high trust in their societies and can
<br>
therefore freely trade and immigrate between each other. The primary
<br>
immigration problems in the EU are from immigrants from non-member
<br>
states, particularly non-member states which sustain low trust
<br>
societies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can envisage a free state as being potentially either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defensive or offensive from a libertarian perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on how wide a group of people one aims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to extend liberties too. Would a free state be like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last enclave of the American dream or would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it as a prototype to be copied and extended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; globally? 
</em><br>
<p>Copy it and extend it globally, but do not leave your original, or your
<br>
copies, wide open to dilution and dissolution by trade and immigration
<br>
from low trust societies...
<br>
<p>THis is not to say that trade and immigration should be completely
<br>
prevented. Quite the contrary, but products produced in non-free
<br>
environments should be tariffed, and the tariff money used toward
<br>
efforts to increase freedom and trust in those environments, if not
<br>
liberating them entirely, as well as defending free and high trust
<br>
societies against the depredations of non-free and low trust societies.
<br>
Immigrants from such societies should be welcomed as refugees and
<br>
defectors, but should be required to go through far more rigorous
<br>
civics, poli-sci, and history training, as well as literacy proficiency
<br>
before becoming citizens.
<br>
<p>Libertarianism will only be secure when the entire world is free.
