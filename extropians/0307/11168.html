<em>&gt; It's nice to see someone from the &quot;inside&quot; questioning the axioms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism is based on. Such reflections are important. I don't quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with your pessimism, though.
</em><br>
<p>Pessimism implies a poor attitude.  I am not trying to throw cold water on
<br>
future predictions.  I am trying to describe accurate history that people
<br>
seem to be ignoring.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think shortly after that we will reach a point at which living in space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is considered safer then being exposed to the threats of living on earth.
</em><br>
<p>I know, but when this was scheduled for the 1970's and has been delayed 30
<br>
years, it is hard to call this exponential growth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, the cost of leaving earth is steadily declining.
</em><br>
<p>Untrue.  NASA's shuttle fleet is much more expensive than single-use
<br>
rockets.  The cost savings that were predicted by reuse never materialized.
<br>
Our current payload sizes, ranges, orbital heights and costs are all worse
<br>
than the rockets we replaced.  The shuttle is a poor competitor to the
<br>
Saturn V.  It can't go as high.  It can't even put satellites in orbit.  The
<br>
satellites need their own little boosters to go higher than the shuttle can
<br>
fly.  The shuttle cannot escape earth orbit.  It may not even qualify as a
<br>
space ship in the stricter sense of the word.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised if Microsoft announces a move of their HQ from Seattle to space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes around 2020-30. At that time, Bill Gates will of course already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be living there.
</em><br>
<p>Since NASA was previously approved to have a 1000-man permanent colony on
<br>
the moon in the 1970's, I don't see how the above prediction contradicts my
<br>
position.  I have no doubt that this will happen some day.  But how can
<br>
anyone deny that this has been delayed from previous plans?  Instead of
<br>
accelerating exponentially, we have had major setbacks and have not
<br>
recovered our former capabilities yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I fail to see how you can draw that conclusion. The average life span is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steadily increasing, as well as the quality of life as a senior. At the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time, we are close to eliminating a whole range of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age-related diseases.
</em><br>
<p>I am talking &quot;predicted&quot; life-span.  Antioxidants were thought to extend
<br>
animal lifespans to the equivalent of 120 human years.  People on those
<br>
antioxidant diets literally predicted 120-year lifespans.  We don't do this
<br>
anymore.  Our own personal predictions have decreased.  What part of this do
<br>
you not understand?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heck, even the worlds biggest rock band today is a bunch of 60-year olds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=MISS70306281736&amp;sql">http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=MISS70306281736&amp;sql</a>B</em><br>
Bly09ke9t7q79)
<br>
<p>60 yeas old is a pathetically young age to die.  This is not a good example
<br>
to give me for longevity.  Nobody on a life-extension diet would be happy
<br>
with those kinds of numbers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Conclusion: time will be on our side.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps in the future, but it has not been so in the past decade or two of
<br>
life-extension therapies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have personally never really believed in cryonics
</em><br>
<p>Neither do a lot of former believers, unfortunately.  Cryonics has to
<br>
advance back up to the point where we once thought it already was.  We now
<br>
know more than we did before, and it doesn't look as rosy as it once did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hans Moravecs book &quot;Robot&quot; describes how AI-researchers ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the dawn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the field has been limited to 1 MIPS-computers. It isn't until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 90's,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when ordinary PCs broke the 1 MIPS-barrier, that the computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources available to AI-researchers has begun to climb.
</em><br>
<p>I totally disagree with this analysis.  AI research has never been limited
<br>
by processing power.  It is not like folding@home where we know what to do
<br>
but can't get enough cpu power.  AI programs simply don't work or don't pass
<br>
a basic Turing test to appear conscious.  It is not a speed issue.  I could
<br>
deal with a perfect AI that is very slow.  What we have fast-enough programs
<br>
that simply don't work.  I assume that is why Eliezer is working on FAI
<br>
instead of tweaking hardware to run faster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While it is difficult for me to know anything about your initial level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectation, I gather from your post that it was quite high (world peace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and immortality isn't exactly something that happens over night).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aim for the moon, the tree tops feels like a failure.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to have missed my point.  I clearly gave you my level of
<br>
expectations.  We were exploring the moon.  There were multiple permanently
<br>
manned space stations.  We thought we had already doubled human lifespan.
<br>
We thought cryonics was a pretty good bet.  AI was progressing nicely.
<br>
Communism had fallen and the world seems more politically whole.  None of
<br>
those things are true anymore.  We have years if not decades of work to get
<br>
back to where these statements are all true again.
<br>
<p>People who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.  And I am afraid that
<br>
this is exactly what is happening.
