<p>
I'm new here, but it seems odd to me that the largest, most often visited
<br>
topic on this board is &quot;flame wars&quot;. Over half the traffic on the list seems
<br>
to be people complaining about being insulted,  complaining about the
<br>
complainers, or complaining about the complaining about the complaining.
<br>
<p>One of the risks of putting an idea into the open is that you are subjecting
<br>
your opinion to ridicule. If I put an idea out there and someone shoots it
<br>
down or makes me look like a fool, I have the option to ignore them just as
<br>
much as they have the option to ignore my statements. Someone has to take
<br>
the higher ground.
<br>
<p>Why is it that a board full of brilliant people seems to have trouble
<br>
putting things behind them and moving forward? Why is everyone so sensitive?
<br>
<p>Personally, when I throw out an idea, I want to hear exactly what everyone
<br>
has to say about it; even if it isn;t very nice. That doesn't mean I want to
<br>
hear name-calling, but I have thick skin and I can take it. Asking people to
<br>
censor their opinions to keep me from &quot;feeling bad&quot; would be
<br>
counter-productive to my reasons for being here in the first place.
<br>
<p>So can we PLEASE put this &quot;flame wars&quot; topic behind us? I know I am fairly
<br>
new to this board, but it just seems to be a huge waste of time!

Subject: RE: flame wars
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Spike wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ja, this list is indeed flamey, always has been.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would suggest that it is possible to have totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; open and honest discussion of difficult topics while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maintaining diplomacy, good will and having some fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish.  But history has shown differently.  For whatever reason, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian List has not been able to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We can maintain the spirit of Crocker's rules while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still being open, diplomatic, kind and honest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find that most people quote Crocker's rules as an excuse to participate
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; insulting or ad hominem attacks in violation of the list rules.  I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure if Crocker's rules and the current list rules are compatible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As a thought experiment, think of the most honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never-tell-a-lie person you can imagine, one who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also a kind-hearted soul.  Consider him in a typical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropianesque no-win situation, translated into an old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; familiar setting:  &quot;Jesus, do these pants make my butt look fat?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, he could use my usual technique of feigning an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; epileptic seizure, but that in itself is a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dishonesty and they don't fall for it after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fourth time.  It would be perfectly honest for him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answer with a simple &quot;no&quot;, even if he is actually thinking:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;No, those pants dont make your butt look fat.  Its your fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; butt that makes your butt look fat.&quot;  Notice that a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;no&quot; is true, is far more diplomatic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spares feelings, follows the spirit of Crocker's rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of internet exchange.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a straw-man and has nothing to do with insulting behavior or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal attacks.  The problem with arguing for &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;honesty&quot;, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all attackers are sure they are being truthful and honest in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks.  Even the 911 terrorists claimed truth, honesty and integrity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their actions.  Such a standard, while theoretically sound, is almost
</em><br>
never
<br>
<em>&gt; useful in practice.  Humans always seem to be able to justify their
</em><br>
actions
<br>
<em>&gt; in their own minds such that they are the good guys.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We deal with some difficult topics on this list, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I call on people to eschew heated argument in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; favor of controlled argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can &quot;call&quot; for this all you want, but it never happens.  Why would
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; call be any different?  Seriously, do you think you have just solved our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems?  If not, what would be a good solution to stopping flame wars.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; think they are self-destructive behavior which nobody wants.  But we do
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; seem to want to stop them either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ExI's best days are yet before of us.  Let us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cut down on rancor and fan the flames of progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We are on the eve of construction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, but let's not just say it as a matter of faith.  Let's take real
</em><br>
action.
<br>
<em>&gt; What exact changes do you propose to make that will cut down on rancor?
</em><br>
If
<br>
<em>&gt; no changes are made, none will occur.
