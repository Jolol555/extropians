-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Karen Rand Smigrodzki
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Spike&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ja, and I wish someone could explain to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why it is that riding a motorcycle causes all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women in view to appear more attractive
</em><br>
<p>...I know many women personally who are attracted to motorcycle riding
<br>
men; those same women tend to be the ones that are turned on by &quot;bad
<br>
boy&quot; types...
<br>
<p>Sure however motorcyclist as bad boy is somewhat
<br>
outdated.  Or is it?  Seems like a lot of pro-
<br>
establishment proles (like me) ride motorcycles
<br>
these days.
<br>
<p>I was thinking of how the genome somehow influences
<br>
the organism to seek out healthy mates, explaining
<br>
why peahens are attracted to the big brightly colored
<br>
tails, which imply robust health.  If one is too old
<br>
or too creaky, one generally chooses other means of
<br>
transportation than bikes.  Motorcycling requires a
<br>
higher level of alertness, balance and perhaps 
<br>
strength, if one wishes to survive long at it.  
<br>
<p>So motorcycling implies healthy rider, which results
<br>
in the female passers-by look at the rider with a 
<br>
little more warmth, smiling and posturing in a more 
<br>
attractive way?
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;...Why one would feel increased desire while riding may in part be
<br>
(some of) the physical and visual stimulation you suggested. I would
<br>
also suggest that it is in part the effect of knowing that women who see
<br>
you on a bike will
<br>
(often) find you more desirable (as the bad boy); it is probably
<br>
commonly known that knowing someone desires you can cause you yourself
<br>
to become aroused. Very helpful for procreation.  If you could convince
<br>
yourself that everyone who saw you riding was extremely turned off
<br>
sexually by you, do you think that you would have the same increase in
<br>
desire?  --karen
<br>
<p><p>Well, Karen, perhaps you are right, however deep
<br>
down I fully realize that even on the fastest and
<br>
coolest bike, I am still a pencil-necked geek.  The
<br>
real explanation may be as simple as this: when I
<br>
am riding I am having fun.  Fun is inextricably 
<br>
linked to copulation.  Ergo, all females within
<br>
visual range get a free half a standard deviation
<br>
added to their attractiveness.
