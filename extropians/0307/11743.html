<p>
Having observed this going on for several years now,
<br>
and having myself started quite a number of both the
<br>
major discussion threads and also several truly
<br>
spectacular flame wars, my only real gripe is how long
<br>
it takes to dig thru all this mess to get to the
<br>
interesting news and thoughts.
<br>
<p>Having said that, I would like to point out one
<br>
overwhelming fact: most of the flame wars are
<br>
recursive and self-sustaining.  Most of them appear to
<br>
start out with someone making some statement that
<br>
offends someone else.  The someone else then escalates
<br>
to claiming that the statement in question is SO
<br>
OFFENSIVE! that it has no business being there.  Then
<br>
the first person - or perhaps a third party - comes
<br>
back with a further escalation to - &quot;Who are YOU to
<br>
say what should be posted?&quot;  
<br>
<p>So, a minor issue that could have been simply ignored
<br>
or commented on in a neutral, non-offensive tone as
<br>
being inappropriate to the EXTROPY list triggers a
<br>
whole passionate, often vitriolic series of
<br>
escalations to the point of name-calling and
<br>
not-so-vieled threats of exclusion or expulsion.
<br>
<p>This clearly has a chilling effect upon people who
<br>
might have something interesting to say but have no
<br>
desire to be drawn into such silly contests.  When
<br>
you're expending energy dealing with one of these
<br>
useless epiphenomyna, then that's that much less
<br>
energy you have to put into something productive.  One
<br>
shouldn't have to worry that much about what other
<br>
people will think, especially on the EXTROPY list,
<br>
which is by definition concerned with what is new,
<br>
exciting, controversial.  If we're going that route,
<br>
then we should just appoint a censor, and submit
<br>
everything to him/her.
<br>
<p>With regard to the problem of filtering, ISIL has
<br>
taken over a libertarian news group recently which
<br>
uses a rating system for posters, based on the ratings
<br>
that other readers make for their posts.  Perhaps a
<br>
dual rating system might work even better.  I'm
<br>
thinking about a cumulative rating system for authors
<br>
of posts, together with a rating of individual posts. 
<br>
This might cut down on the wasted time.
<br>
<p>However, often it is the very people who are most on
<br>
the cutting edge - almost by definition - who will get
<br>
the lowest ratings.  So, a possible third element
<br>
would be the flatness or spread of ratings.  If a few
<br>
people like some post a LOT, then that itself may be a
<br>
noteworthy fact.  If someone is so far out that NO ONE
<br>
can appreciate them, then what is the point of the
<br>
post anyway, except for saying it for the record,
<br>
perhaps, which I do occasionally, knowing that no one
<br>
will agree with me (but I know that I will often get
<br>
to say years later &quot;I told you so!&quot;).
<br>
<p>The best method, of course, would be that employed
<br>
first by FIREFLY, before the Borg ate them and their
<br>
work disappeared or got patented away from public use.
<br>
&nbsp;FIREFLY's system asked you your preferences over a
<br>
wide range of fields and then, when you were looking
<br>
for a book, movie, restaurant, date, whatever, it
<br>
would look for profiles otherwise matching yours and
<br>
assign weighted ratings to the choices it returned, as
<br>
in, &quot;People similar to you in their prior choices
<br>
liked this book.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Amazon uses a similar system, as in, if you liked
<br>
this, then you will probably like ....
<br>
<p>(In the early '80's, I designed a much more
<br>
sophisticated system that encompasses both what Amazon
<br>
and FIREFLY did and would be a thousand times better
<br>
as a filter, but so far no one has been interested in
<br>
even hearing the details on it. But that's another
<br>
subject. NIH uber alles.)
<br>
<p>Perhaps someone who is into JAVA or SQL or some other
<br>
server-side programming could either write or find an
<br>
open-source model for this that the EXTROPY news group
<br>
could use?
