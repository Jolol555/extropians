</em><br>
<p>Prap's were talking at cross purposes I am more interested in 
<br>
the free market as a global phenomenon. Partly because I've read
<br>
some things which seem to me to make some plausible arguments
<br>
that we may be at a sort of local peak in the rolling out of free
<br>
markets. Ie. Going from *some* imperfect free market nation
<br>
states to a free market world economy faces some serious
<br>
challenges. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But I wouldn't say that it destroys itself - it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poorly capable of defending itself against the greed, hatred,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and short-sightedness of humans who initially make it work.
</em><br>
<p>Fair point. So far the actually destruction of the free market is
<br>
hardly proven. But so too is the establishment of a global 
<br>
free market of the form that I imagine that you and I would 
<br>
approve. As is often the case in discussions with extropes
<br>
good points can be made for seemingly opposing viewpoints
<br>
but often it does turn out that the topic under discussion, 
<br>
in this case the free market, has different meaning for 
<br>
different folks. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Also, there is the difficulty with the provision of certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods, such as information.
</em><br>
<p>Completely agreed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Long-range planning, the very long range enlightened 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest, could  perhaps allow the formation of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable free market with minimal or none of  the brutal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopolist practices typical of the state, with polycentric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law, and yet providing the average humans with much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more services than any other  system.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed it could. But will it? How do we (people concerned
<br>
with such things chart sensible paths from here to there
<br>
the desired destination). All to often it seems to me that
<br>
disagreements amoungst extropes about what to do next
<br>
as a practical step come down to triaging from our 
<br>
different perspectives and circumstances.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Presently most humans (including a fair number of capitalists)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are incapable of such long-range planning, but this could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  happen yet, as life-spans lengthen and intelligence grows.
</em><br>
<p>There are systems in place that actually work against long
<br>
range planning. One of which is the four year electral cycle.
<br>
A government can't implement policy unless it is elected
<br>
and this puts four year planning horizons on some of 
<br>
the countries that have the greatest capacities to institute
<br>
reforms.
<br>
<p>I think longer life spans will make an impact but longer or
<br>
alternatively arranged means of government better able
<br>
to concentrate on long term policy is probably just as 
<br>
important.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>(Perhaps I should have bundled these two responses)
