<em>&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Spike&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;We are instructed to dismount the bike and *walk*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;it across the street or intersection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;I ask you: is this not absurd? Do motorcyclists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;push their bikes across the intersection?...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very true.  Plus as you and I know (being bike owners), there ain't no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who'll tell a biker where he can &quot;push&quot; his mount :)  James...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ja, and I wish someone could explain to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why it is that riding a motorcycle causes all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women in view to appear more attractive, by a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half a standard deviation.  Do men appear more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive to female motorcycle riders?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about homosexual motorcycle riders: does their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bike cause their favorite gender to look more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive?  And why is it that a woman on her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own motorcycle drives us mad with desire,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of her other socially redeeming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities or lack thereof?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could there be some fundamental explanation I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missing?  Such as the weather is usually warmer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nicer when we are riding, so the women on the street
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be wearing more flattering, more revealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothing?  Perhaps seat applies direct pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the prostate, which somehow triggers a surge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hormones or an increase of semen pressure on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain?  Or is it just that we are in a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mood when riding?  All of the above?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;That might partially explain the increased desire of the one riding, but it
<br>
won't account for the increased desire of the one watching the rider.  I
<br>
haven't ever ridden a motorcycle personally. I know many women personally
<br>
who are attracted to motorcycle riding men; those same women tend to be the
<br>
ones that are turned on by &quot;bad boy&quot; types. The standard explanation for
<br>
that attraction is probably well known.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Why one would feel increased desire while riding may in part be (some of)
<br>
the physical and visual stimulation you suggested. I would also suggest that
<br>
it is in part the effect of knowing that women who see you on a bike will
<br>
(often) find you more desirable (as the bad boy); it is probably commonly
<br>
known that knowing someone desires you can cause you yourself to become
<br>
aroused. Very helpful for procreation.  If you could convince yourself that
<br>
everyone who saw you riding was extremely turned off sexually by you, do you
<br>
think that you would have the same increase in desire?
