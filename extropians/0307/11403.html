[ Inspired by the mosquitos of New Haven and Kalix :-) ]
<br>
<p>What to do about mosquitos? Besides being terribly irritating, in many 
<br>
places they transmit dangerous diseases. While chemical repellents work 
<br>
to some extent they might be too costly for the thrid world, have toxic 
<br>
side effects and need to be applied regularly. Insecticides work better, 
<br>
but often cause ecological disruption . mosquitos are an important part 
<br>
of the ecosystem. Spreading sterile mosquitos to cause a decline in 
<br>
population is costly, since the numbers of mosquitos are so large.
<br>
<p>On the more radical side, it ought to be possible to genetically 
<br>
engineer mosquitos to avoid humans. But how to introduce such genes into 
<br>
the mosquito population and make them dominant? A possible approach 
<br>
would be evolutionary: introduce an evolution pressure on the mosquitos 
<br>
to avoid humans.
<br>
<p>My suggestion is along these lines: many people take pills that contain 
<br>
a substance that acts as a mosquito contraceptive. Mosquitos that bite 
<br>
such people will be less fertile, and hence not pass on their genes to 
<br>
the next generation. Mosquitos that tend to avoid humans will have more 
<br>
offspring and become more common. Over the next generations mosquitos 
<br>
will become increasingly human-friendly.
<br>
<p>Will this work? It depends on whether it is possible to create a cheap 
<br>
substance acting as an insect contracpetive that stays relatively long 
<br>
in the human body and does not cause side effects. Enough people need to 
<br>
take it to make the fitness of human-biting mosquitos less than 
<br>
human-avoiding mosquitos (human-avoiding mosquitos probably currently 
<br>
have a slightly smaller fitness since humans are common, large and 
<br>
well-fed mammals in most environments). The larger the fitness decrease, 
<br>
the faster the evolution towards the avoiding form. The behavior also 
<br>
needs to be changeable; this seems likely since many insect parasites 
<br>
are species-specific.
<br>
<p>Some drawbacks are: There might be an evolution towards contraceptive 
<br>
resistance rather than non-biting. Ideally different pills should 
<br>
contain different contraceptives making such resistance unlikely and 
<br>
evolutionary harder than evolution towards non-biting.
<br>
<p>Humans need to continue taking the pill to keep the selection pressure 
<br>
up. If they stop human-biting mosquitos will start to increase again. 
<br>
There will also be an influx of such mosquitos from regions where the 
<br>
pill is not commonly used (while non-biting mosquitos will move into 
<br>
these regions). This might lead to a tragedy of the commons problem, as 
<br>
mosquito protection is a public good but the slight discomfort/cost of 
<br>
the pill makes people want to avoid it . unless of course taking the 
<br>
pill can also be made to benefit them too. Maybe the mosquito 
<br>
contraceptive should be packaged together with a nutrient supplement of 
<br>
some kind? In general the logistics and the economics of this 
<br>
evolutionary approach to mosquitos needs to be studied a bit more 
<br>
closely. The principle seems to be fairly simple and robust, but the 
<br>
actual implementation might be done in many different ways. 
<br>
<p>What do you think?
