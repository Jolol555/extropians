It is fascinating in many ways. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a) How do extropians/transhumanists deal with very strong cultures

</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more correct than those they have grown up with their entire lives?]
</em><br>
<p>There is actually an interesting problem here. The Extropian Principles
<br>
doesn't give much ethical help since they are mostly about how *we* are
<br>
supposed to act ourselves, not much about how we are supposed to act
<br>
towards others. On the other hand, &quot;reading between the lines&quot; and
<br>
situating the principles in their humanistic-liberal ideological context
<br>
gives some more help.
<br>
<p>The key points are open societies and self-direction. DPRK is awful in
<br>
this respect, almost the exact opposite. But the principles as such do
<br>
not tell us if it would be wrong to induce them on DPRK against its will
<br>
(except of course that doing so would also contradict the principles of
<br>
an open society and self-direction). But from the classical liberal
<br>
analysis, it is wrong to try to impose one's views onto others even when
<br>
one considers them really good - with the exception of a minimalistic
<br>
but universal bedrock of human rights. It is here you could actually get
<br>
support to do something towards DPRK, in order to make sure the people
<br>
there enjoyed univeral human rights (another thing to debate is of
<br>
course the exact list of rights; I don't have the time and space to go
<br>
into it except to note that there are important issues in avoiding UN
<br>
declaration style positive rights and that negative rights are more
<br>
important). 
<br>
<p>So this ethical approach would say that societies like DPRK should be 
<br>
left alone as long as they respect human rights, and if they don't we 
<br>
ideally should help their people get human rights using as minimal means 
<br>
as possible. No need to storm every luddite enclave, just make sure they 
<br>
are kind to their children and cannot isolate them completely. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; b) How does one deal with the entropic issue that the diplomatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; route may ultimately be extremely wasteful?  Though I'm sure Nick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not appreciate my citing his paper in this context, his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Development&quot; paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html">http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helps to shape the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The numbers speak for themselves -- 10^14 potential human lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per second of delayed interstellar colonization (minimum).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So lets see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Afghanistan (pop: 28m), Iraq: (pop: 25m), N. Korea (pop: 22m)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we could eliminate the problems distracting us from making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress at the cost of &lt; 10^8 lives -- compared with 10^14
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives *per second* while we keep debating how to resolve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;Roasting On&gt;
<br>
Emlyn correctly pointed out that potential people do not have the 
<br>
ethical weight of real people. If they did, then contraceptives would be 
<br>
murder.
<br>
<p>Also, this is a good example of how consequence ethics need to look at
<br>
complete second order effects. The first order effect is the removal of
<br>
certain people (very negative). The second order effect is a *predicted*
<br>
(note that there is uncertainty here!) removal of distraction leading to
<br>
a glorious future (a high reward times a very uncertain probability
<br>
term). But there is also a probability ~1 effect of *lots* of people
<br>
hating whoever did that fiercely - it is one thing for anti-american
<br>
demonstrators to call the US genocidal, but if it actually did kill
<br>
millions you would get a massive worldwide humanitarian reaction as well
<br>
as millions of people thinking &quot;OK, they are a threat against us. How do
<br>
we take them down?&quot;. So the total second order effect would likely be
<br>
slightly negative (glorious future minus being hated nearly everywhere).
<br>
The third order effect is of course when people start to put their plans
<br>
of taking you down into motion. Millions of Osamas with lots of 
<br>
government support. This extremely likely third order effect is also 
<br>
extremely likely to be negative, since it would be a ridiculously strong 
<br>
distraction, and in fact might view any ideological reasoning used to 
<br>
justify the primary action tainted for a very long time (think of how 
<br>
avoiding dysgenics still remains taboo 70 years after the Reich). 
<br>
<p>From an engineering perspective, it is a bit like using a dirty nuke to
<br>
build a ditch needed for a vacation resort. It makes a ditch of
<br>
uncertain usability and makes the resort impossible. 
<br>
<p>This is also why I don't think basic utilitarian arguments work: they do
<br>
not have any safeguards against atrocities for the common good. 
<br>
&lt;Roasting Off&gt;
<br>
<p>The value of diplomacy depends on the situation and how it is run. Also,
<br>
there are more tools than killing people or talking to diplomats,
<br>
fortunately. What really brought down the soviet union was that certain
<br>
western memes could spread and exploit the inherent weaknesses of the
<br>
system; it was largely aided by widespread information diffusion rather
<br>
than any concerted psyops effort. Make communications equipment more 
<br>
available, and certain systems become unstable. Inefficient systems will 
<br>
see their own inefficiencies if they engage in trade, and have an 
<br>
incentive of becoming more efficient (and in the economy today you win 
<br>
greatly by having free, creative and entrepreneurial citizens unless you 
<br>
are a single raw-material nation) as well as not attacking their trade 
<br>
partners. And so on. The world system is a much more complicated system 
<br>
than a game of Risk.
<br>
<p>DPRK is a hard nut to crack, since it has 1) isolated itself to a unique
<br>
extent. 2) stayed off the radar until very recently so that the nations
<br>
with an interest to sneak democracy into it have not had the time to do 
<br>
any real efforts. This leads to a situation where it needs outside 
<br>
support to survive due to its own inefficiency (which would likely 
<br>
destroy it fairly quickly otherwise), promting it to blackmail. My 
<br>
suggestion would be to stall the blackmail (that is one thing diplomacy 
<br>
is wonderful for) while really finding creative ways of creating 
<br>
stronger communications links to the outside world - in DPRK, they 
<br>
actually are weapons of mass destruction. But even then it will take 
<br>
time. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd rather see strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that justify a suboptimal extropic vector (perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has to sacrifice optimal paths to practical considerations).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is just starting to look like each U.S. citizen is on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hook for about ~$350 this year for activities in Iraq and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we already have a huge sunk cost (in nuclear weapons) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the means to eliminate that expense (ignoring Afghanistan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; N. Korea).
</em><br>
<p>Governments are good at suboptimality. 
<br>
<p>Note that we are not sacrificing the optimal path by the current
<br>
strategies, they still keep it open. They are expensive, inefficient and
<br>
likely could be done much better. But then the issue is doing them much
<br>
better rather than switching to a completely different strategy that in
<br>
many ways is worse.
