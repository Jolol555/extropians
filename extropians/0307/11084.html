<p><em>&gt; Rafal wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Because &quot;not bothering&quot; results in unpleasant subjective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experience.  Also, what do you mean by &quot;existence&quot;?  Minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which do not bother to exist, have a smaller measure in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; platonic pattern space, which might for some other minds be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a reason enough to bother.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, wait up there. An infinite space can't really be partitioned like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that. You either take up none of it, or a finite subset of it, or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite subset of some order equal to or less than its order.
</em><br>
<p>No, Rafal's wording is exactly correct.  Imagine a slice of pie the
<br>
way that scientists thought of it before atoms were widely believed
<br>
in.  A slice is a fraction: if we substitute a mathematical disk,
<br>
then one is entirely correct to say that although both the disk and
<br>
the slice of it have uncountably many points (more than merely 
<br>
countably infinitely many), while &quot;fraction&quot; still retains its usual
<br>
meaning.  Therefore, if I decide to kill myself, then this action
<br>
is replicated in all the solar systems where identical Lee's reside,
<br>
and in all the parallel universes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it clear that making the effort to exist, or to make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are 10 copies of yourself rather than 1 actually impacts in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any way on the space of possibilities in any meaningful way?
</em><br>
<p>I would say yes, and the reason once again is the &quot;fraction&quot;.  The
<br>
idea of fraction is spiffed up in a branch of mathematics called
<br>
measure theory, wherein one speaks of something's &quot;measure&quot; and
<br>
one should read that as &quot;fraction&quot; or &quot;percentage&quot;.
<br>
<p>*Almost* everything is the same as it would be without MWI or all
<br>
the infinitely many other solar systems---but *not* everything.
<br>
<p>One difference is that if you had integrated these latest findings
<br>
into your emotional responses, then when a friend says that his
<br>
brother has died after a terrible bout with cancer, you are properly
<br>
sympathetic.  But if his brother died from having been struck by
<br>
a meteorite, you merely console your friend by reinforcing his knowledge
<br>
that this was a fluke, and that his brother is doing well in almost
<br>
all the other solar systems and universes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Arguments about striving to survive because we evolved to are explanatory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not sufficient for justification in the light of a philosophy (transhumanism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which rejects the constraints of naturally selected mental structures.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree totally.  One should strive to survive because you
<br>
can obtain benefit.  Where there is energy and intelligence, there
<br>
can be happiness.  And one owes it to himself to attempt to arrange
<br>
things so that you and the entities you care about can achieve 
<br>
maximum benefit.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  I see now that Rafal said a lot of this in a later post,
<br>
and on my earlier posts Jef and Hal had said a lot of what I
<br>
wanted to say.  Sorry if it's redundant, I'm just finding it too
<br>
expensive to read everything before giving into the urge to reply.
