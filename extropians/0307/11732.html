</em><br>
<p>I'm going to give the same response to your public post that I did to your 
<br>
private post.
<br>
<p>The only comment I have to make is that sometimes things happen which gets 
<br>
in the way of our plans.  People lose jobs, get divorced, or deal with a 
<br>
death of a loved one.  These unplanned wild cards can interrupt our lives 
<br>
to such a degree that sometimes, we have to start all over again.
<br>
<p>This is not the case with me.  What I had intended to do with Pro-Act will 
<br>
be accomplished in another way, through another means, with a another goal, 
<br>
and for another, but I think better, result.
<br>
<p>So, it is unfortunate that the very day at Extro 5 that I gave my talk and 
<br>
made a public announcement of Pro-Act I was hemorging.  It is also 
<br>
unfortunate that I learned I have cancer 2 days later, and that I had 
<br>
surgery 3 days later, and have spent the last 2 years in remission.
<br>
<p>Dealing with cancer is major.
<br>
<p>Putting this aside, I think my concept of Pro-Act was a success because 
<br>
what I have been doing for the past two years has been far above and beyond 
<br>
what I had planned to do as a person and with activism, and pursuing a very 
<br>
important and well-needed concept for the world.
<br>
<p>But I'm not going to state here what my plans are at this time.
