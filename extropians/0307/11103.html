<p><em>&gt; Damien's critic is right; reproducing the Born probabilities is a serious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with many worlds.  In a stochastic reduction theory, you can just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posit the probabilities; you haven't explained them, but at least they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't contradict anything.  In many worlds, you have a straightforward way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to calculate probabilities, namely counting worlds, that gives a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *different* answer, which is a much more serious problem.  You can deal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this problem by positing an infinity of &quot;minds&quot; per &quot;world&quot;, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then split during measurements due to some unknown process.  Or you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state decision theory axioms that declare that we do not care about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counting worlds.  Neither of these is very satisfactory in my opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My solution (published this month in Foundations of Physics) is described 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/mangledworlds.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/mangledworlds.html</a> .
</em><br>
<p>Is there a problem with this URL?  It doesn't work for me.

<p><em>&gt; One difference [using MWI] is that if you had integrated these latest
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; brother has died after a terrible bout with cancer, you are properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathetic.  But if his brother died from having been struck by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a meteorite, you merely console your friend by reinforcing his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge that this was a fluke, and that his brother is doing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well in almost all the other solar systems and universes.
</em><br>
<p>Really? Is this a standard version of the MWI?
<br>
<p>Whereas yes, improbable worlds are rare, I hasten to add that
<br>
it's not (yet?) standard to extrapolate to how one should feel
<br>
about it 8^D.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I am not really familiar with Many World's and regard it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a degree of scepticism that verges on outright suspicion).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But are you saying that in alternative universes under MW's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meteorite strike can happen or not but that cancer is a given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in all of them?  This seems pretty bizarre.
</em><br>
<p>As Damien said, the cancer will probably turn out to be in
<br>
hindsight more inevitable that we judge the meteorite to be.
<br>
This means that from a set of initial conditions that you
<br>
probably ought to identify with---that is, a collection of
<br>
world containing a recognizable Brett Paatsch and his friend---
<br>
then the development of the cancer occurs in a larger share
<br>
than does the freak accident.
