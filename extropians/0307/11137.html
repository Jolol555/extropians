</em><br>
<p>Let me get this straight.  You're aware that people who are sent here
<br>
have committed nothing except resisting being told what to do?  One
<br>
person was sent here for having the wrong boyfriend.  But because
<br>
there's a punishment, you apparently believe that the punished person
<br>
*must* have done something wrong?  That's exactly the reaction that
<br>
this place tries to brainwash teenagers into.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How in the hell could she lay there hour after hour, day after day,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to happen?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>How in the hell could they punish her with solitary confinement for
<br>
'hour after hour, day after day, without saying, &quot;Just how stupid could
<br>
it be for[...]' us to kidnap and punish this woman for being someone
<br>
other than who we, her tormentors, want her to be?  Why would you blame
<br>
the victim, here, Lee?  Do victims of other crimes also bring it all on
<br>
themselves?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (This is not the same as a great martyr standing up for his God, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political dissident refusing to divulge the names of other dissidents.)
</em><br>
<p>No, it's simple kidnap and torture.  No political principles, just an
<br>
ordinary crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even this article, which was written from the perspective of someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who finds everything about this to be somewhat abhorrent, admitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in some cases, the resulting people and their parents are quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy about the eventual outcome.  Deep waters here, IMO.
</em><br>
<p>I would imagine (though I'm not a psychologist or doctor) that this
<br>
is equivalent to &quot;Stockholm syndrome&quot;.  If you allow the process to
<br>
continue to completion, you get a model serf.  If you rescue the
<br>
individual halfway through, you get an angry victim who'd love to
<br>
press charges.  In a free society, rescuing these people halfway
<br>
through would be a fine business opportunity.
