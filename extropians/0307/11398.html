</em><br>
<p>This assumes there is a way of shutter gravity. It is an old idea in sf 
<br>
(Cavorite in H.G. Wells _First Men on the Moon_), but when viewed in 
<br>
general relativity it does not make much sense: gravity is the effect of 
<br>
curved spacetime, so how do you shutter it in? You would need a way to 
<br>
prevent the curvature at one point to affect a nearby point which would 
<br>
require either that you somehow made the Einstein equations stop acting 
<br>
or introduced a new curvature field in between that did the job - and 
<br>
that likely involves manipulating absurd amounts of mass and/or exotic 
<br>
matter again. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is *very* expensive relative to the manipulation of photons (which

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; else for the questions it would raise....
</em><br>
<p>So, any ideas for this research program? In what ways can we generate
<br>
gravitons (if working within the particle physics framework)? 
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the ideal method would be to convert one species of
<br>
particle into gravitons plus some other species, like how we can get
<br>
neutrinos from beta decay. But that likely would require the existence
<br>
of some symmetry-breaking current that allowed interaction between the
<br>
other three and gravity.
<br>
<p>In the GR field framework the issue would be to make strong gravity
<br>
waves without having a large energy tensor. Maybe that can happen if one
<br>
already has a big (complex) gravitational field where small inputs can
<br>
be amplified by tapping energy or curvature already existing in the
<br>
system. IMHO this sounds less unlikely than the previous approach, but 
<br>
still not particularly promising. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Another really interesting question, which just occurred to me, is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does gravity reflect? are their materials which absorb/rebuff gravity...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or is it all simply a matter of constructive/destructive interference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sans reflection?
</em><br>
<p>Static gravity fields do not seem to reflect/refract, but there are
<br>
indeed some weird goings on for dynamic strong fields. Look at
<br>
<a href="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SCMS/DigLib/text/astro/Gravitational-Wave-Black-Hole-Hobill.html">http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SCMS/DigLib/text/astro/Gravitational-Wave-Black-Hole-Hobill.html</a>
<br>
for example, which shows some nontrivial &quot;refractions&quot; of a gravity 
<br>
wave.
<br>
<p><p>In general (no no pun intended) you need to learn more about general
<br>
relativity in order to say something constructive about gravity. It is
<br>
not the simple force we usually assume. Check out the links at
<br>
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/relativity.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/relativity.html</a> I especially like Greg
<br>
Egan's tutorial
<br>
<a href="http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/FOUNDATIONS/index.html">http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/FOUNDATIONS/index.html</a> and the

FAQ at <a href="http://www2.corepower.com:8080/~relfaq/relativity.html">http://www2.corepower.com:8080/~relfaq/relativity.html</a> (which has
<br>
a nice treatment of the speed of gravity issue)
