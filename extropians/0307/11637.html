<p><em>&gt; For the record, all my complaints were summarily dismissed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderator(s) previous and current.  I was told that I could not complain on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behalf of others.  I have consistently refused to complain on behalf of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.  During my decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list, I have never had any complaint accepted by any moderator.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Okay, if you say so.  Well, somebody complained.
<br>
<p>But anyway, why isn't all that behind us?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, Mike, I don't think that it was really a big deal, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taxing for those of us worrying that finally after all these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years maybe speech on the Extropian list would not be free. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But free it has remained, not surprisingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no free speech on this list while members report that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are too afraid to speak publicly for fear of personal attacks.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is a new definition of &quot;free speech&quot; to me.  I will
<br>
have to think about it.  I certainly cannot think of any 
<br>
historical parallels now.  Besides, to define a freedom in
<br>
terms of how people *feel* sounds quite peculiar.
<br>
<p>I will maintain that speech is free when people are permitted
<br>
to say anything that they want.  Of course, this implies that
<br>
on no moderated list is speech *completely* free, but a practical
<br>
first approximation is that one is free to say anything whatsoever
<br>
provided that one is not excessively engaging in personal attacks.
<br>
<p>Could you tell me who is afraid to speak publicly for fear of
<br>
personal attacks or other criticism?  (It's not that I expect
<br>
you here to betray confidences---perhaps some of these worthies
<br>
have written some posts, either by name or anonymously?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We lose more speech when people drop out, stay silent, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curtail their own speech than we gain by allowing insulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ad hominem speech to continue.  Flame-wars do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage free speech and participation, they suppress it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, apparently I am taking my own advice only too well, 
<br>
because I am not aware of any really problematical tendencies.
<br>
Why do you think that the usual list moderators are not up to
<br>
dealing with the problems that do occasionally arise?
<br>
<p>Lee
