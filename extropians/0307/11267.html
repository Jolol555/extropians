<p><em>&gt; I can't answer your question, but did you check out problem

<em>&gt; number three on my list?  Apparently Bayesian statisticians

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Those remarks, as well as the problem below, come from a link
<br>
<a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/xge/press_releases/september_2001/xge1303380.html">http://www.apa.org/journals/xge/press_releases/september_2001/xge1303380.html</a>
<br>
in an email written by Damien Sullivan on January 26, in the
<br>
thread entitled &quot;Teaching Bayesian Inference in Two Hours&quot;.
<br>
I continued:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, problem number three is hopefully my long sought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rosetta Stone that does not require talking of distributions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see Bayesianism rear its head.  (I do have one smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and much easier problem that lies bare the differences, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this here might be much hotter stuff.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, now it seems to me that in this particular problem, it's
<br>
easy to think, wrongly, that an answer is possible.  So I apologize
<br>
for putting it on the list (at the time, I thought that I just
<br>
wasn't quick enough.)  I still maintain that there is not enough
<br>
information in it.  But now I believe that that goes for
<br>
Bayesians as well as for everyone else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3. The probability that a newborn will have deformities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    traceable to a sickness of its mother during pregnancy is 1%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    If a child is born healthy and normal, the probability that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    the mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 10%.  If a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    child is born with deformities that can be traced to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    sickness of the mother, the probability that the mother had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    rubella during her pregnancy is 50%. What is the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    that a child will be born with deformities if its mother had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    rubella during her pregnancy?
</em><br>
<p>In this stupid problem, the authors badly misstate at least one
<br>
of the premises, in my opinion.  If you draw a picture of the
<br>
problem, perhaps, you may be less likely to misread it than if
<br>
you plug the numbers into a formula.
<br>
<p>And the heresy P(AB) is not equal to P(A|B)*P(B) appears in this
<br>
quote from the above paper:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Germany, every expectant mother must have an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obligatory test for rubella infection because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children born to women who have rubella while
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pregnant are often born with terrible deformities.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following information is at your disposal:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probability that a newborn will have deformities
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;traceable to a sickness of its mother during pregnancy is 1%.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a child is born healthy and normal, the probability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 10%.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a child is born with deformities and it can be traced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to some sickness of the mother, the probability that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother had rubella during her pregnancy is 50%.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the probability that a child will be born with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deformities if its mother had rubella during her pregnancy?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bayesian solution p (H | D) is .048.  But participants
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who use one of two non-Bayesian algorithms, computing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p (H&amp;D) = .005 or picking p (H) = .01, will produce
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;estimates that lie in the interval of ±5 percentage points
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around the Bayesian solution.
<br>
<p>But why shouldn't p(H&amp;D) --- that is, p(defect &amp; rubella) be equal
<br>
to .005?  What other conclusion can one come to from the first
<br>
statement together with the third statement?
<br>
<p>Unless, they fail to believe that p(H&amp;D) = p(H|D)*p(D).  Sure
<br>
enough, go back a couple of paragraphs in that paper, and find
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most frequent non-Bayesian algorithms they identified
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include computing p (H&amp;D) by multiplying p (H) and p (D | H);
<br>
<p>No wonder I can't grasp Bayesianism.   ;-)
<br>
<p>Of course, it is a libel to say that Bayesians would be guilty of
<br>
believing that p(H&amp;D) was not equal to p(H|D)*p(D).  But I was
<br>
hoping that it would turn out to be the case that in some problems
<br>
they do not---now I simply believe that the authors are full of shit.
<br>
And I think that their study is deeply flawed too, as a predictable
<br>
result of inflicting this problem on a lot of innocent victims.
