It is also true that to get gravity waves one has to manipulate *very*
<br>
large masses.  
<br>
<p>Me: or shutter a large mass :) like a signal fire :) Why build the fire
<br>
when you can misdirect it using a blanket :)
<br>
<p>That is *very* expensive relative to the manipulation of photons (which
<br>
effectively have very low masses [based on E = mc^2]).
<br>
<p>Me: Depends on how you do it :) no doubt an elegant solution is just
<br>
waiting to be found :)  At this point, I wouldn't say its
<br>
impossible, or even improbable :)  Just that more data is needed :)  In
<br>
any event, it certainly is worth examining, if nothing
<br>
else for the questions it would raise....  As to light, generally
<br>
coherent light is used as signaling mechanism; however, the
<br>
same effect (a sheild) could be used for say, the light of a
<br>
sun(star)...
<br>
<p>consider the effective size of the sun on our retina...now say I had a
<br>
shield roughly the size of the moon (the size of the shield
<br>
would of course, be dependant on the resolution of our telescopes versus
<br>
the distance to the receiver.... ergo, if we were trying
<br>
to communicate really far away, you could scale the size of the shield
<br>
down, and place it in an orbit), I could open or shut
<br>
it using morse code.  certainly anybody looking at the sun would notice
<br>
my attempt at communication...  and you could further 
<br>
enhance said communication system, by aiming additional telescopes
<br>
(corrected for phase), off stellar clouds of gases
<br>
and synchronizing a shield-gate system, thus minimizing down time (where
<br>
other stellar objects blocked the receivers view
<br>
of the source 'light').  The main reason I don't like this as an
<br>
approach, is that I suspect that gravity propogates
<br>
faster :)  but the same effect could be generated by skewing the
<br>
pulse...
<br>
<p>for instance, say I have a stable stellar object which is generating
<br>
large gravitational pulses, coded to a particular
<br>
frequency;  say I know where my receiver is; there's no reason why I
<br>
couldn't have a significantly smaller gravitational
<br>
force (would probably be energy-based, not matter based) skew the
<br>
generating source frequency enough to mess up
<br>
the receivers signal.  It would be the equivalent of us agreeing on a
<br>
stellar object, measuring its frequency, the receiver
<br>
setting his receiver to that frequency, and us introducing a &quot;drift&quot;
<br>
from the source transmitter, using the drops as a method
<br>
of communicating information.
<br>
<p>Another really interesting question, which just occurred to me, is:
<br>
does gravity reflect? are their materials which absorb/rebuff gravity...
<br>
or is it all simply a matter of constructive/destructive interference
<br>
sans reflection?
<br>
<p>anyway :) all stuff over my head in any event...for now :P
