</em><br>
<p>I'm a singularity sceptic. What do you take to be the
<br>
Yudkowskian Singularity? I am curious if it would overlaps
<br>
with Eliezer's view of the Singularity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are science fiction pipedreams.  They're not even very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good ones.  Further, we need to &quot;deconstruct&quot; our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relation to the computer revolution.  We're on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other side now, I mean this in complete seriousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computer revolution is played out.  All that is left is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for computers to recede; not in the hip, ubiquitous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology &quot;computer in my doorknob&quot; sense but in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;everybody stopped caring&quot; sense.
</em><br>
<p>Well leaving aside the impact of computing in genomics
<br>
and proteomics.  I am in the middle of reading Kevin 
<br>
Warwick's book 'I, CYBORG' (pub 2002).
<br>
<p>According to the blurb, Kevin Warwick (professor of
<br>
Cybernetics) has been using himself as a guinea pig 
<br>
recieving, by surgical operation technological implants
<br>
connected to his central nervous system. 
<br>
<p>I haven't yet got to the part where he succeeds or fails
<br>
in sending a nervous signal over the internet to a partner
<br>
but it is clear that the what is know in detail about
<br>
the human nervous system is limited and that there may
<br>
be exciting possibilities in medicine and in adding additional
<br>
sensors (perhaps as mitigators for those who have 
<br>
disabilities) using electronics and new uses of computing.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the biological revolution will ensure
<br>
that people will &quot;not stop caring&quot; about computing in the
<br>
near future. 
<br>
<p>Then there is the matter of quantum computing and 
<br>
quantum encryption. I think it unlikely that privacy or
<br>
the underpinnnings of the global financial system will be
<br>
a matter of indifference and so in another way people
<br>
will care about computing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This may mean they'll take different shapes.  But that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, that's your revolution.  Now it's time to look back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ask ourselves what was real and what was hype. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of it was hype. But that's our origin and we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pick it apart to understand where we came from. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Artificial Intelligence, of the CS kind, of the kind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumes we can design Minds (not brains) through 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort of hokey self-reflection, is the sort of hubris
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we must now only find humour in. 
</em><br>
<p>Well I'm sceptical but I'm not laughing. Whats the joke?
<br>
Are you suggesting Artificial Intelligence is impossible?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Which is not to say computer simulation won't play a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big role in the brain sciences or any other science, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it's a tool now, nothing more.)
</em><br>
<p>Okay, this answers my points about biotech enabling. 
<br>
But much is said when a quantum computer or an 
<br>
algorithm for determining how proteins fold is described
<br>
&quot;as just a tool&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if you bracket the three &quot;ultratechnologies&quot; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned only as a thought exercise, it's interesting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see how the horizon changes.  [With]out superintelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [with]out the technological Saviour-God, there is no wall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over which we cannot see.
</em><br>
<p>This criticism is good imo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Without uploading, we're going to die unless we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight for it. 
</em><br>
<p>I concede this but with the reservation that cryonics
<br>
*might* offer some chance. Though I've never yet heard
<br>
a satisfactory operational explanation for the reassembly
<br>
process. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Curing aging is only a first (incredibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult) step, the way we value our lives will have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change, the medical practise will have to change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Nobody wants to live to 400 and slip in the bath,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crack their  head open on the faucet.  It's an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different attitude towards death and we have to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to the world. 
</em><br>
<p>It is not that simple. There are important questions of
<br>
triage. The world does not make decisions, individuals
<br>
do, and individuals confront mortality personally.
<br>
<p>A solution for everyone aged 40 or less now if fixed
<br>
as an operational objective would ostracise the over 
<br>
40's. There may be *no* effective political place to
<br>
draw the line for *any* organisation that starts with 
<br>
the priority of confronting individual mortality first,
<br>
unless that organisation decides to pursue its goal
<br>
deliberately leaving some part of the human species
<br>
outside its considerations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without drexlerian nanontechnology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and I speak more of the supposed time frame than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the technology itself) there is no sudden &quot;fix&quot; for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor, the starving.  We need to engineer crops, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educate people, provide clean water.  None of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going to be easy.  We're not going to get off-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  soon either, so, yes, we're stuck here amidst the war,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the famine, those evil fundamentalists.
</em><br>
<p>For now yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People who complain about our slow progress, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question whether things will work, point out flaws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in existing plans, etc., are the real heroes of tomorrow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  They are the engineers of the future.  People who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't know enough technology to see the flaws, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who are so optimistic that  they don't see any need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to address the flaws, are the people who are delaying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; progress.  Dynamic Optimism was never intended to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faith-based position. 
</em><br>
<p>Excellent point.  Belief  *itself* strongly suggests a form of
<br>
pathology. Belief and reason are incompatible where one
<br>
is happening the other is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We were supposed to be optimistic that everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was possible so that we would continue working 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; toward a solution while others had long since given up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Optimism should be an excuse to work harder for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the future, not an excuse to sit back and do nothing.
</em><br>
<p>Optimism as pragmatism without abandoning hope. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and as well as realising that this stuff requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard work, we need a *critical* approach to technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need to take our heads out of the sand, lose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous &quot;luddite&quot; talk,
</em><br>
<p>This &quot;luddite&quot; talk could have an important political 
<br>
purpose. We should remember that it is up to those
<br>
who wish to change the status quo in democracies that
<br>
have the burden of making the case. The luddites are
<br>
the conservatives. They don't have to work so hard
<br>
to sell their message - its the default.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and realise that, yes, technology does effect peoples
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  lives, and that, no, not all technology effects all lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a positive way.  
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Technophilia doesn't cut it. 
</em><br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Technology is ideological in the strongest sense. 
</em><br>
<p>No this is a non-sequitor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The telephone has something to say about personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space, personal time, about availability, about distance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it embodies certain attitudes towards these things. 
</em><br>
<p>Bulldust. The telephone is inanimate. Any attitude you
<br>
see in a telephone is your projection. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Technology is not neutral. It meets the world in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  form of products or govenment programmes;
</em><br>
<p>Ah you mean particular instances or embodiments
<br>
of technologies not all technology per se. What is
<br>
developed or realised in particular as opposed to
<br>
what is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science has a claim to neutrality, its realisation in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology has long since lost it. 
</em><br>
<p>This I don't follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And we must always keep in mind that science only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes a *claim* to neutrality: universality is the target 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of science, not its immediate achievement.  We can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be critical of science, we must be.
</em><br>
<p>Bollocks science has *no* aims. Scientists do. Your
<br>
anthropomorphising. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We must be able to be critical of some research, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some applications of science, some technologies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to make a fair argument for others. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  To take a specific example: with genetically modified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foods our fight is to move the field of battle from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general,  from the sweeping accusation, to the specific.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  We have to acknowledge that, yes, there are some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative uses here.
</em><br>
<p>You make a good general point but what do you mean
<br>
&quot;we&quot; white-man :-) What is the glue that you imagine
<br>
binds *us*? The ExI Principles? A shared desire to 
<br>
avoid death?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  However, the mistake we don't want to make is t[o]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  focus on the catastrophic.  That's the mistake Foresight 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made.  Nobody references Drexler because he's the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grey goo guy. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually Foresight is bigger than Drexler and it is referenced.
<br>
Glenn Fishbine author of  &quot;The Investors Guide to 
<br>
Nanotechnology and Micromachines&quot; is no disciple of Drexler,
<br>
but specifically acknowledges the influence of Foresight as a
<br>
player in setting the larger scene of policy around nanotech.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You can think on whatever timeframe you choose, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your prerogative, but you can only act on a human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; timeframe.
</em><br>
<p>Good point. And further action if it must be coordiated between
<br>
multiple agents (to be effective) requires planning cohesion and 
<br>
shared objectives. The prioritisation of these is not easy to agree
<br>
on in practice because we all bring our own egos and timetables
<br>
to the table.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's funny is, a lot of fears could be alleviated if we just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admitted how difficult this stuff is. 
</em><br>
<p>Some. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Designer babies?  Not likely!
</em><br>
<p>Bad example. Choosing a child sex could be engaging in
<br>
designer babies and it has already happened at least once
<br>
in an IVF clinic. I understand dwarf couples have also been
<br>
alloud to have a dwarf child - which incurred a backlash as
<br>
it was considered that dwarfism is accompanies by other
<br>
health defects. 
<br>
<p>Clones as copies of the self - that is a good example of 
<br>
a furphy.
<br>
<p>Sorry for the forensic criticism. I thought this was
<br>
an excellent post.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
