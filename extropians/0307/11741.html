</em><br>
<p><p>I agree with Damien about the value of Bryan's posts. Thank you for coming
<br>
back, Bryan. At the moment, I'd like to respond to two items you
<br>
discussed -- optimism and humility. You said : &lt;&lt;One of the general points
<br>
I'm trying to make here is that we need to foster a sense of humility.&gt;&gt; and
<br>
&lt;&lt;Optimism should be an excuse to work
<br>
<em>&gt; harder for the future, not an excuse to sit back and do nothing.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I would slightly rephrase what you said about optimism, Bryan to this:
<br>
Optimism should be the *inspiration* to work harder for the future, not an
<br>
excuse to sit back and do nothing. Every entrepreneur I've ever met has been
<br>
wildly optimistic. One of my functions as a lawyer/CPA is to spill a little
<br>
rain on my clients' optimism, to the extent of pointing out possible
<br>
weaknesses in their plans possible rough spots they could run into. This may
<br>
be the sort of thing you mean when you say we need to foster a sense of
<br>
humility; but being aware of potential problems is not the same thing as
<br>
being humble.
<br>
<p>I would go so far as to say that too much humility is more likely to cause
<br>
inaction than too much pride. A humble person is more likely to have the
<br>
attitude that nothing she does can make any difference. Rather than
<br>
humility, I think we need to foster a sense of reality-based pride in
<br>
accomplishment and belief in every person's ability to make changes for the
<br>
better. Such changes can't all be listed on a general to-do list (although
<br>
such a list probably wouldn't be a bad idea), because many of the changes
<br>
are personal in nature. I liked something Anders said well enough to repeat
<br>
it here: &lt;&lt;As I see it the question &quot;how can I get involved?&quot; can be turned
<br>
into the question-tree: &quot;Can I turn my current activities and interests into
<br>
something more useful? If not, do I want to change them in such a
<br>
direction?&quot;. Most people are going to find that the first step actually
<br>
gives plenty of room for practical action.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Down to the level of the extremely practical, having to do with  time
<br>
management and taking that first step: the path from the current position to
<br>
the ultimate goal can almost always be broken down into discrete steps. When
<br>
I'm facing a large project and find myself procrastinating, I can almost
<br>
always trace my resistance to beginning the project to a belief that I don't
<br>
have enough time. I can overcome this resistance by breaking the project
<br>
down into sub-projects that can be completed in one or two hours. It's
<br>
almost always possible to find one or two hours in a day.
