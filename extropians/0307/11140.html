</em><br>

<p>David Deutsch (famous quantum physicist and many-worlder) has a good
<br>
pro-childrens-rights essay, The Final Prejudice, at
<br>
<a href="http://www.webleyweb.com/tle/le970401-10.html">http://www.webleyweb.com/tle/le970401-10.html</a>.  He analyzes a Star
<br>
Trek episode in which Captain Picard is transformed into a shape which
<br>
causes no one to take him seriously.
<br>
<p>Deutsch also links to an organization, Taking Children Seriously,
<br>
<a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/</a>, dedicated to the principle that &quot;it is
<br>
possible and desirable to bring up children entirely without doing things
<br>
to them against their will, or making them do things against their will,
<br>
and that they are entitled to the same rights, respect and control over
<br>
their lives as adults.&quot;
