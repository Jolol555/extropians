<p>
When you are 19, your intuition is clear as a bell, and you
<br>
have utter and supreme confidence in it.  You have not seen,
<br>
normally, baffling counter-examples to &quot;obvious&quot; theorems,
<br>
or the two-envelopes problem, Monte-Hall, Simpson's Paradox,
<br>
Unexpected Hangings, etc.
<br>
<p>That's how it was with me in 1967 when I was 19 and first
<br>
encountered Bayes' Theorem in Gnedenko's Theory of Probability
<br>
textbook.  I was appalled that something so simple as the Bayes'
<br>
Formula should have a *name*.  To me, it was as if someone's
<br>
name were attached to the general solution of N equations in N
<br>
unknowns.
<br>
<p>(This is a phenomenon among the quite young; a few years ago
<br>
a brilliant mathematician I knew---still a teenager---had run
<br>
into the Borel-Cantelli lemma in probability theory, and was
<br>
in turn appalled that something so &quot;obvious&quot; had a name!)
<br>
<p>Only ten or fifteen years ago did I discover the *true*
<br>
problem that the Reverend Bayes worked on, and why indeed
<br>
his solution/theorem warrants the appellation, and why the
<br>
elementary formula also should therefore be named in his honor.
<br>
<p>Here is the sort of problem he had obtained an answer to:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next room you hear shouts of &quot;I win!&quot; alternately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with &quot;Damn!&quot; from one particular player, and you realize
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that he is playing some sort of game with perhaps cards
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or dice.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear &quot;I win!&quot; three times, and &quot;Damn!&quot; twice.  What
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is the probability that he will win the next round?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or, for the non-Bayesians, what do you estimate to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the probability or likelihood he will win the next round?)
<br>
<p>I *believe* that the non-Bayesians will calculate a likelihood
<br>
curve, but the Bayesians will go right ahead and announce a
<br>
probability.  (With a prior uniform distribution, I, and the
<br>
Reverend Bayes, and the Bayesians---I think---use a little
<br>
calculus to get an answer.  I will go dig up my answer and
<br>
post it.)
<br>
<p>Here is Bayes' original problem, in his words, in the 1750s or so:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Given* that the number of times in which an unknown event has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happened and failed: *Required* the chance that the probability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of its happening in a single trial lies somewhere between any 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two degrees of probability that can be named.
<br>
<p>Already he wanted the probability density (distribution function).
<br>
And in his paper published later by the Royal Society, he got it.
