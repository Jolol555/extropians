John B had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; A rather disturbing story published in the UK Guardian...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://education.guardian.co.uk/classroomviolence/story/0,12388,987932,00.html">http://education.guardian.co.uk/classroomviolence/story/0,12388,987932,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Or go to the observer.guardian.co.uk page and scroll down to &quot;The Last Resort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (part one)&quot;  Deals with a 'behaviour modification centre' for teens in Jamaica...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; . . very bad juju, IMO.
</em><br>
<p>Randy comments
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we have lost touch with our past and our biological destiny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most cultures used to have a tradition of taking teenagers out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family setting when they start acting up at &quot;a certain age&quot; (such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12-15 years of age). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It varied from culture to culture.  One culture might force the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teenager to go live in a male barracks, where the older males make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them into men, none too gently. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't know about &quot;losing touch with our past&quot;---perhaps.
<br>
But stress should probably be placed on *varies from culture to
<br>
culture* and we should avoid at all costs the notion that there
<br>
has to be one right answer here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another tribe or culture might force him out of the village and into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long journey.  Young male humans are NOT evolved to be sitting in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classroom at 13.
</em><br>
<p>But some young male humans evidently *are* evolved to do just that,
<br>
and many others can with a nip from the bottle...er... I mean, with
<br>
the help of a little ritalin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These are schools for problem kids who hate their parents, who hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school, who are getting in trouble with drugs, etc etc etc, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are places where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kids are disciplined roughly until they are damned glad to see their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents and go back to a safe suburban life . They are the quick,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap and dirty version of military schools, but these schools are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the reach of western legal systems. From the perspective of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former teacher of kids 12-14, this sounds like a very good idea.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  I am sure of this:  there are SOME situations in
<br>
which our &quot;enlightened&quot; abstract notions of freedom and
<br>
worship of individuality are inappropriate.  There *have*
<br>
to be hell-stories of teenagers bent not only on destroying
<br>
their own lives, but the lives of everyone they will come
<br>
into contact with.
<br>
<p>Now [is it evil for me to anticipate objections?], some will
<br>
say that the parents are in no place to judge these intractable
<br>
questions about how the life of their kid is turning out or
<br>
will turn out.  But I have two answers.  One is that if not
<br>
them, then who?  And if they can't exert control over kids at
<br>
age 16 then why permit them to send a kid to his room (depriving
<br>
him of freedom) and restricting his friends and when he can see
<br>
them (denying him freedom of association)?
<br>
<p>The second reason is that he who foots the bill should have the
<br>
say.
<br>
<p>Consider this passage from the article:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When most children first arrive they find it difficult to believe that they have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no alternative but to submit. In shock, frightened and angry, many simply refuse
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to obey. This is when they discover the alternative. Guards take them (if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary by force) to a small bare room and make them (again by force if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary) lie flat on their face, arms by their sides, on the tiled floor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched by a guard, they must remain lying face down, forbidden to speak or move
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a muscle except for 10 minutes every hour, when they may sit up and stretch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before resuming the position. Modest meals are brought to them, and at night
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they sleep on the floor of the corridor outside under electric light and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gaze of a guard. At dawn they resume the position.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is known officially as being 'in OP' - Observation Placement - and more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casually as 'lying on your face'. Any level student can be sent to OP, and it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;automatically demotes them to level 1 and zero points. Every 24 hours, students
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in OP are reviewed by staff, and only sincere and unconditional contrition will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earn their release. If they are unrepentant? 'Well, they get another 24 hours.'
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One boy told me he'd spent six months in OP.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't think this could be true, but it transpired this was not even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceptional. 'Oh no,' says Kay. 'The record is actually held by a female.' On
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and off, she spent 18 months lying on her face.
<br>
<p>Now, ahem, I have always been of agreeable disposition---there is not,
<br>
truth be told, much of the rebel in me, and I sincerely do admire those
<br>
who are ready to stand up against the whole world whenever.  But isn't
<br>
*this* pathological?  Doesn't it seem to indicate that there really is
<br>
something deeply, deeply, serious wrong with this girl?
<br>
<p>How in the hell could she lay there hour after hour, day after day,
<br>
without saying, &quot;Just how stupid could it be for me to have gotten
<br>
myself into this situation?  Exactly what was so important that this
<br>
had to happen?&quot;
<br>
<p>(This is not the same as a great martyr standing up for his God, or a
<br>
political dissident refusing to divulge the names of other dissidents.)
<br>
<p>Even this article, which was written from the perspective of someone
<br>
who finds everything about this to be somewhat abhorrent, admitted
<br>
that in some cases, the resulting people and their parents are quite
<br>
happy about the eventual outcome.  Deep waters here, IMO.
<br>
<p>(Yes, I *do* realize that this could be and surely *sometimes* is a
<br>
too-easy solution, and I remind you of Randy's words, who talked
<br>
of many other options.)
<br>
<p>Lee
