</em><br>
<p>But... why?  Why postulate this?  What is the motivation for this dark and 
<br>
gloomy view of the world?  And especially, how can you walk up to people 
<br>
who say &quot;I want to be a better person&quot; and say &quot;No you don't&quot;?  I'm not 
<br>
asking about the gloominess, mind you, I'm asking what definition of 
<br>
volition you're using.  How can you determine what people want to want 
<br>
except by asking them?  If I believe that I want to be nicer, and I 
<br>
believe that I want to want to be nicer, so that to the question &quot;Do you 
<br>
want to be a nicer person?&quot; I answer &quot;Yes&quot;, then to where are you jumping, 
<br>
outside that system, to determine that the real answer is no?
<br>
<p>Or to put it another way, if you define a renormalized goal system it is 
<br>
possible for people to be wrong about what they really want.  I don't 
<br>
quite see how you can be wrong about what you *want* to want, except by 
<br>
reference to a third-order aspiration somewhere.
<br>
<p>If someone has the cognitive representation that they want to be nicer, 
<br>
and also contains emotional hardware supplying positive reinforcement to 
<br>
darker actions, it is not at all clear to me (to put it mildly) that the 
<br>
emotional hardware should take precedence over the cognitive 
<br>
representation in defining the person's volition.
<br>
<p>It might make more sense to dispense altogether with the disputed term 
<br>
&quot;want&quot; and speak separately of cognitive representations and emotional 
<br>
hardware, leaving the construction of a definition of volition to some 
<br>
later date.  In other words, people might have built-in tendencies and/or 
<br>
pleasurable reinforcement on ignoble behaviors, and inaccurate cognitive 
<br>
representations for those tendencies, and positive reinforcement for those 
<br>
inaccurate representations (i.e., they Hanson-&quot;want&quot; to disbelieve, 
<br>
although not necessarily Eliezer-&quot;want&quot; as I define volition).
<br>
<p>Thus a journey of self-discovery can either succeed in uncovering the 
<br>
darkness and giving someone the reflective ability to fix it, or it can 
<br>
short-circuit on the construction of still more pleasurable delusions. 
<br>
This I would not argue with.
<br>
<p>Looking at such an inconsistent cognitive system and saying what he or she 
<br>
&quot;wants&quot; is a different, and far more complex, issue.
<br>
<p>I am objecting to your phraseology here because it seems to preemptively 
<br>
settle the issue by identifying people's built-in emotional reinforcers as 
<br>
their real wants, while dismissing their cognitively held hopes and 
<br>
aspirations and personal philosophy as a foreign force interfering with 
<br>
their true selves.  One could just as easily view the system from the 
<br>
opposite perspective.
