</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, it does sound like the standard apology. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But evolution and similar time-asymmetric complexity increases cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occur unless 1) some information is erased to produce selection or 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is always more resources to encode information in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not clear to me that 1) always has to be true; but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do a good job of delineating the possibilities here:
</em><br>
<p>To get evolution you need replication, variation and selection. Unless 
<br>
selection is all about number of offspring (case 2), some replicators 
<br>
have to be removed. (Here replicators do not need to be beings, they 
<br>
could just as well be memes or engineering designs).  I think you can do 
<br>
the variation part without losing information (just attach a changelog), 
<br>
and if you have free memory space you can replicate with no loss (but 
<br>
this only work if the memory is known to be zeroed; overwriting stuff 
<br>
implies erasure and energy dissipation). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Second, pain might perhaps be replaced by non-pleasure. But in many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; learning rules there is an inherent difference between non-pleasure and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aversive experience, and it could be that the most efficient learning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rules belong to this category. Then the issue becomes a choice between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pain or lesser learning abilities. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's been pointed out many times, I am sure, that the kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds we would like to become would still encounter disappointment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and frustration.  Fine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The aversive experience I have in mind is the hideous burden that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent creatures continue to suffer under because they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not yet gained control of their internal workings.  An extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid beast needs to be reminded not to kick certain kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objects, for example, and extremely and long-lasting pain was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most efficient teacher.  I propose to do away with all stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures, and, in fact, probably most matter that is not itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent and capable of getting along quite nicely without pain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot imagine the case that you are discussing: namely, an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent entity whose learning is advanced by the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain experienced by lower animals and, sadly still, humans.
</em><br>
<p>Human thinking and behaving is right now extremely colored by that we
<br>
seem to be based on temporal difference reinforcement learning.  We get
<br>
a bigger reward from when things turn out better than expected than when
<br>
things turn out just right. This makes us look for new 
<br>
possibilities more than we would have done if we had another form of 
<br>
reinforcement learning, even if that is just as good from a pure 
<br>
learning standpoint. This and many other quirks of the learning rule 
<br>
makes us who we are. Changing the rule might be possible, resulting in 
<br>
subtle changes of the posthuman mindset. 
<br>
<p>But it is still not clear to me that an antisymmetric utility function
<br>
(X units of bad is felt as -1*(feeling X units of good) so we can
<br>
replace bad experiences with absences of good) will be a useful option. 
<br>
Risks against survival have to change behavior far more strongly than 
<br>
absence of a strong reward signal. Or is this prejudice from a world 
<br>
where survival risks are common? Maybe it is not necessary in a world 
<br>
where it is really hard to hurt oneself. But as _The Golden Age_ points 
<br>
out, a world with mental technology is filled with subtle dangers we 
<br>
really need to find ways of avoiding. 
<br>

<p>Hmm, a rather dangerous sentiment. :-)
