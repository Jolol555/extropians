<em>&gt; &gt;Ok, now this is less useful too general, I think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Hi reason and thanks for your feedback. I might have made an effort to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine what the GKES header on this thread meant before posting, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead I simply 'winged-it' based on the remainder of the subject line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;One can assume that we're all interested in grassroots transhumanism, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I might have been more specific there. I meant 'meatspace grassroots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism'. In other words, I am interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism-for-dummies-like memes and vectors specifically enabling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general non to semi-technical population (or the 'proles' as spike might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say) in my immediate geographical region (i.e. my salon client base) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorably grasp, participate in, and profit from the project of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What, specifically, are you actually *doing* in the sense of organizing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;creating?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Pretty much that.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, but what *is* it that you are organizing/running/creating? e.g.
<br>
some people here manage transhumanist websites, others run advocacy groups,
<br>
others are scientists in appropriate fields with interesting projects, and
<br>
so forth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I'd like to have some sort of lower-bound cut-off off on project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;effort/size on this list in order to keep it useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Surely you meant to type &quot;this thread&quot; not &quot;this list&quot;. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the discussion of things relevant to transhumanists and transhumanism. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just one other list member finds a part of what I write to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to transhumanism, then what I have written is *useful* by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition. And up to eight times a day I might add.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, I was referring to the text list (under construction by Dan Fabulich) of
<br>
definitive, identifiable, transhumanist-relevant larger projects that people
<br>
on this mailing list are working on.
