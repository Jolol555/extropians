<p>...y'know, that's a predictable enough outcome, from a
<br>
certain point of view, that one might start to wonder
<br>
if he planned it that way.  Consider: you're the Iraqi
<br>
Minister of Info.  Say you know exactly what's going
<br>
down, and your boss left you with the castle when he
<br>
fled, so you owe him no loyalty any longer.  You're
<br>
looking out for number one.  But you were his Minister
<br>
of Info, and you know how big on info the US is.
<br>
(Maybe you don't exactly know what, say, a &quot;cyberwar&quot;
<br>
is, beyond generally an attack on their information
<br>
infrastructure, but you've read articles saying
<br>
they're
<br>
scared fecesless about it.)
<br>
<p>How logical a conclusion would it be, then, that you
<br>
might be their number one target or close to it, and
<br>
if
<br>
they catch you as is, they'll grill you for the rest
<br>
of
<br>
your (probably unnaturally short) life trying to find
<br>
more WMDs than actually exist (whether or not Saddam
<br>
had any in the first place)?  And once you reach that
<br>
conclusion, what strategies pop up for extricating
<br>
yourself from that fate?  Lying brazenly and openly
<br>
with a straight face until they arrive, then offering
<br>
to cooperate once they do, seems like a simple plan.
<br>
<p>This is all speculation, of course.  If he did do it
<br>
deliberately, he can never confirm it for any kind of
<br>
record.  And there are quite a few who might not
<br>
believe him if he did anyway.
