$5 million a year for an American National Preparedness 
<br>
Centre (who thinks these names up) to examining ethical
<br>
issues relating to nanotechnology. Looks like the job
<br>
prospects for ethicist are getting rosier. I wonder if they
<br>
multiply in proportion to the number of issues, or if they 
<br>
get even a little bit thinner as nanotech, joins stem cells
<br>
and GM food as something to be 'deeply concerned' 
<br>
about.  I suspect its the former.

<br>
(Actually maybe an 'open' review of the safety of 
<br>
nanotech may be better than a govt block as a result of
<br>
someone deeming that nano has weaponry implications)

<br>
Probing Nanotech's 'Dark Side'
<br>
<a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2003/701/2">http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2003/701/2</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;The U.S. Congress is on the verge of approving legislation
<br>
&nbsp;that would require the government to examine the implications
<br>
of nanotechnology as it pumps funds into the promising field. 
<br>
The U.K. government is also moving to probe nanotech's 
<br>
promise and peril.
<br>
<p>Researchers have touted nanotechnology--an array of
<br>
techniques that allow the manipulation of matter at the atomic
<br>
scale--as the next big thing, producing everything from better
<br>
materials to tiny robots. But some commentators warn of a 
<br>
darker side. Prominent computer scientist Bill Joy, for instance,
<br>
worries about the creation of self-replicating &quot;nanobots&quot; that 
<br>
could run amok, coating Earth in a blanket of &quot;gray goo.&quot; 
<br>
Such scenarios are unlikely, argue mainstream researchers. 
<br>
Still, many say that the growing field's potential impacts 
<br>
deserve a closer look.
<br>
<p>The House and Senate have recently worked on bills 
<br>
(H.R. 766 and S. 189) that would require the government to
<br>
fund studies on the social, economic, and environmental 
<br>
impacts of civilian nanotechnology. The House bill orders
<br>
the government to report on &quot;the development of safe 
<br>
nanotechnology,&quot; including a study of its use for 
<br>
self-reproducing machines, artificial intelligence, and &quot;human
<br>
brain extenders.&quot; A bill passed in June by the Senate 
<br>
Commerce Committee would authorize $5 million a year for
<br>
a special American Nanotechnology Preparedness Center
<br>
to examine ethical issues relating to nanotechnology. The full
<br>
Senate is expected to approve the legislation later this 
<br>
summer, and the two bodies will then reconcile their 
<br>
differences. 
<br>
<p>In Britain, meanwhile, the government last month asked the
<br>
Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering to
<br>
review nanotech's ethical and social implications. The joint
<br>
panel, which is expected to hold its first meeting next month,
<br>
aims to &quot;determine where we are with this technology, what
<br>
we want from it, and what safeguards [we] need,&quot; says 
<br>
chair Ann Dowling, a mechanical engineer at the University
<br>
of Cambridge. A final report is due next spring.&quot;
