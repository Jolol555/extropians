<p>### I can echo Steve Witham's mention of Antonio Damasio's &quot;Descartes'
<br>
Error&quot; in this context. As it happens, I am now about halfway through
<br>
&quot;Looking for Spinoza&quot;, the newest book by Damasio, and I am more attuned to
<br>
the interdependencies between emotions, feelings and reason, rather than
<br>
their opposition.
<br>
<p>There seems be a line of tension between the built-in hardwired simple
<br>
emotional reactions (brainstem, limbic system) and the adaptive, learning,
<br>
general-purpose deliberation (prefrontal cortex). The former cannot accept
<br>
certain outcomes and automatically, unthinkingly act to achieve their preset
<br>
goals. The latter is capable of self-referential examination and recursive
<br>
change. If logical deliberation leads one to conclude that some unwished-for
<br>
event is inevitable, the emotional brain is incapable of accepting it.
<br>
Consequently, there are elaborate mechanisms of self-deception (evolved and
<br>
learned) to prevent a constant activation of the flight-or-fight systems is
<br>
response to the realization of the inability of reaching hardwired goals.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it is the feeling that provides the motive force for
<br>
deliberation to take place, and to tie its results to the actual physical
<br>
body where this information processing takes place. I am using &quot;feeling&quot; in
<br>
the sense that Damasio describes it, an awareness of one's body, the
<br>
condition it is in, and awareness of one's quality of thinking (fast,
<br>
brilliant, slow, muddled). Damasio's favorite subjects, patients with
<br>
prefrontal cortex damage, are incapable of binding the results of
<br>
deliberation (which they provably can perform, in IQ tests and in tests of
<br>
social reasoning) to appropriate actions (they tend to mess up their lives
<br>
horribly). It is unclear to me if it is possible to build a sentience
<br>
capable of long-term survival without having at least some form of the
<br>
information processing (and maybe the qualia) that we call feeling. I guess
<br>
it might be possible, but we have too little knowledge to reasonably
<br>
speculate here. However, at least for the classic human neuroform, feelings
<br>
are crucial to appropriate functioning.
<br>
<p>The problem with the senator's reaction (aside from other contributing
<br>
factors, like cynical calculation of personal gain from publicity, against
<br>
the interests of other Americans) is that they have an insufficient level of
<br>
integration between their emotions and reasoning (if any). Whereas adult,
<br>
well-integrated personalities accept both reason *and* emotions, and learn
<br>
to live with them, our senators, like children who close their eyes to
<br>
danger, choose not to think in certain situations and instead let knee-jerk
<br>
reactions control them.
<br>
<p>I noticed by introspection that feelings, which are subserved by cortical
<br>
mechanisms (mainly the insula, some parietal and frontal activity), are
<br>
modifiable. The switch from one emotional attitude to another can be pretty
<br>
slow, subconscious, and is helped by repetition of exposure to material,
<br>
including one's own deliberative activity, favoring one feeling over another
<br>
(this is BTW, the reason I am appalled by the Tranquility Bay brainwashing,
<br>
aimed at using quirks of our brains to destroy personalities with externally
<br>
provided input). We cannot change our emotions too much, but we can learn
<br>
new feelings, including feelings compatible with reason. It takes much more
<br>
time and effort to convince a human to change feelings than reasoned
<br>
positions but it is possible. This is why a neuroscientist arguing about a
<br>
synapse can convince another one by a bit of empirical data, quickly, since
<br>
usually we do not have feelings about every single synapse. This is why it
<br>
takes much longer for two people to come to an agreement on issues where
<br>
their rationality is directly impacted by emotional inputs (or doubts about
<br>
veracity).
<br>
<p>In the long run, especially with improved intelligence, even politicians
<br>
might learn to combine feelings and deliberation into a rational whole.
