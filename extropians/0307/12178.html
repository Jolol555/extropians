<p><em>&gt; P.S. Another well known example of instinctive moral judgements that

<em>&gt; conflict with those held by many of us is Leon Kass's article, The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wisdom of Repugnance, about his instinctive discomfort with reproductive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.  How can we know who is right, if it's our guts against his?
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly, there was an interview, on PBS &quot;Now&quot;, between Bill
<br>
Moyers and Leon Kass a few days ago.  The URL for the transcript of
<br>
the July 25th 2003 interview appears to be:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_kass.html">http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_kass.html</a>
<br>
<p>Having watched Kass was a bit more revealing than reading Kass.
<br>
<p>Points:
<br>
a) He seems to have been raised in a moderately secular environment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(either Jewish or completely nonreligious).
<br>
b) He seems to have derived his positions from a &quot;search for meaning&quot;.
<br>
c) He does *not* seem to be vigorously opposed to stem cell research.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He clearly states that stem cells may provide cures for human
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diseases.)
<br>
d) He is somewhat opposed to destroying embryos to create new stem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cell lines.  (He views it as unnecessary at this time -- this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a position that might be sharply debated by some biologists.)
<br>
e) He is opposed to cloning.  (He views it as humans taking technology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too far and for little reason/purpose -- justifications are a bit fuzzy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here.)
<br>
f) He is definitely opposed to lifespan extension.  He definitely feels
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that human beings *should* die.  Again, his reasons are rather
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fuzzy (to allow the renewal of the species, to eliminate jaded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perspectives of the old folks, etc.)
<br>
<p>I would consider that his perspectives are most dangerous from the
<br>
perspective of where his &quot;search for meaning&quot; lead him.  It may relate
<br>
somewhat to the &quot;revelation mentality&quot; (&quot;I had a death defying
<br>
experience and I was saved&quot;; &quot;This came to me in a dream&quot;, etc.) ==
<br>
I am not sure.  But from the interview it seemed that his perspective
<br>
was invented and not inherited/derived/etc.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately he comes across as a very educated person with respect to
<br>
scientific principles so one has to ask *how* do people &quot;crossover&quot;
<br>
from the principles of &quot;science&quot; to the principles of &quot;faith&quot;.
<br>
(I believe it may have to do with the desire, or more probably,
<br>
the *need* to create meaning (or purpose) in ones life.  But this
<br>
is just my opinion.)
<br>
<p>However, if the interview accurately represents his positions, Kass
<br>
is most dangerous because he honestly believes that *you* (each and
<br>
every one of us) *should* die.  Due to that perspective he may trump even
<br>
my hand among the players of &quot;genocidal mania poker&quot;.
