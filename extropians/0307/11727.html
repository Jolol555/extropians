<p><em>&gt; Frankly, I am surprised how many liars and hypocrites are present on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list who pretended to agree to follow the list rules when they joined and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then later make it clear they have no intention of keeping their promise.
</em><br>
<p>Obligation, yes, of course.  Sometimes things change in the course of time,
<br>
sometimes thinking in extropian heads bends towards the event horizon of a
<br>
psychic black hole, suggesting to commit a genocide. At this event in space
<br>
time all rules break down, even the rules of the extropian list. At these
<br>
points I feel souvereign enough to attack somebody personally with words.
<br>
Anything else would be the behaviour of a hypocrite. I know that I violate
<br>
the rules but I tell you, if any executive board should exclude me from the
<br>
list because of that I would happily go and not bother you anymore.
<br>
<p>Hey, R.B. talked about killing 10^8 people!
<br>
<p>If no one else stops this inhumane thinking, if most of the answers (except
<br>
Damien's)
<br>
even take it serious, overread Robert Bradbury's outrageous statement or
<br>
dismiss it, not because they find it annoying but because of &quot;the
<br>
ineffectiveness of nuking&quot; which must be either a childish thoughtlessness,
<br>
again cold-bloodedly neglecting 10^8 dead people, or seems to suggest that
<br>
under different circumstances these posters would approve of nuking
<br>
countries like Afghanistan. Iraq and North Korea. (Watch the border line to
<br>
the south though. . . ooops, sorry, well a few hundred thousand South
<br>
Koreans are not really worth worrying about, are they? Any way you
<br>
look at it: a horrible example of depravity in seeking allegedly transhuman
<br>
answers for the fetish technological progress.
<br>
<p>By the way, I *did not* send an appropriate ad hominem attack at all. Since
<br>
Friday I wrote four versions of a *real* AH attack, but was smart enough not
<br>
to send them, to spare you, R.B and me a desaster. So it ended up in my
<br>
friendly letter from which you quoted.
<br>
<p>Yes, sometimes it is wiser to spit fire, poison, venom and yell aloud than
<br>
to remain polite.
