I don't believe this for a minute, but I found this article, 
<br>
thought-provoking, and might be good for few email laughs. The assertions listed below are 
<br>
debatable (even for a US nationalist like myself). Enjoy.

<p><p><p><p>Australia primed to be yanked into US
<br>
By Tess Livingstone
<br>
16Jul03 
<br>
<p>AUSTRALIA has been urged to seriously consider becoming the 51st state of the 
<br>
US. 
<br>
<p>And American-born historian Dr David Mosler told a Brisbane audience 
<br>
yesterday there was a 20 per cent chance of Australia becoming an American state in 
<br>
the next 50 years. The visiting research fellow at Adelaide University, who has 
<br>
lived in Australia since 1971, said the chances would increase significantly 
<br>
in the event of a major Al-Qaeda attack on Australia or if Indonesia became a 
<br>
fundamentalist Islamic republic. 
<br>
<p>Dr Mosler told the 2003 Fulbright Symposium at Griffith University yesterday 
<br>
that he decided Australia was &quot;an unreformable society&quot; after the loss of the 
<br>
1999 republic referendum. 
<br>
<p>Australians, he said, had no flag of their own; a weak sense of nationhood; 
<br>
no prime minister in the Lodge, with John Howard living in Sydney; no national 
<br>
bushfire or water plans, even with the worst drought in history; and no &quot;broad 
<br>
knowledge of nation in public discourse or popular culture&quot;. Australians had 
<br>
replaced &quot;Empire with Yanks&quot; after 1942, and the country retained a 
<br>
&quot;quasi-colonial status&quot;. 
<br>
<p>He said Australian governments, attuned to the British, Americans, Japanese 
<br>
and global capital markets, had &quot;sold off the farm&quot; - electricity, water, 
<br>
ports, airports, resources - while Australians weren't offended by such &quot;treasonous 
<br>
behaviour&quot;. 
<br>
<p>He said Australia's passage to American statehood would not be difficult 
<br>
under its Constitution. 
<br>
<p>He listed the advantages of American statehood for Australia as: 
<br>
<p>* Access to the world's best higher education system. 
<br>
<p>* Large savings on embassies. 
<br>
<p>* Being part of the world's most effective defence system. 
<br>
<p>* Merger with the world's strongest currency. 
<br>
<p>* Being part of the world's biggest economy. 
<br>
<p>* A constitution bringing a republic and a Bill of Rights. 
<br>
<p>* Fielding teams in the US national basketball, baseball and gridiron 
<br>
competitions.
