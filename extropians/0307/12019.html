Would taking Hitler out at an early age actually have been better? Even with
<br>
all the lives saved, it could very well have caused an even larger problem.
<br>
German society was ready for a Hitler when he came to power. Someone else
<br>
would have probably filled his shoes and that person may not have made the
<br>
mistake of going into Russia.
<br>
<p>I have to question the validity of preemptive strikes. To do such a thing
<br>
suggests that the person conducting the strike has prior knowledge that the
<br>
event will take place. Even if a person had made the decision to attack
<br>
another country, they could always change their mind right up to the last
<br>
moment before the first shot is fired. Their reasoning may or may not be
<br>
reasonable, but it could occur just the same.
<br>
<p>The only way to &quot;know&quot; for sure that the attack was going to actually occur
<br>
would be through some kind of psychic ability. Even then, there would be
<br>
some kind of possibility of incorrect interpretation.
<br>
<p>When carrying  out a preemptive strike, we are only weighing possibilities,
<br>
not realities.

<p>&quot;A common mistake that people make when trying to design something
<br>
completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools&quot; -

<em>&gt;   &gt; Suppose that I suddenly found myself in the year 1936 about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; fifty miles outside Berlin, and I had in my hand a remote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; control switch that would detonate a Hiroshima-sized device
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; in the capital of Germany, and that I knew that this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; be my only chance to kill Hitler and his henchmen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; I would scarcely hesitate, even though it would mean the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; immediate deaths of 100,000 people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1936 you would know that Hitler was a very bad person but the trouble
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; you would not know that very soon he would cause the death of 30 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people; nor in 1936 would you know if incinerating the German capital
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; lead to something even worse than Hitler by demonstrating to the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9 years early that nuclear weapons are possible and practical. Even today
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for the North Korea nuclear weapons situation, yes it is very serious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I just don't see a military solution. For one thing it's too late,
</em><br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; already have the bomb, but even with just conventional weapons a new
</em><br>
Korean
<br>
<em>&gt; war would be the biggest bloodbath since World War 2. It is estimated that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Korea has the ability to fire 10,000 heavy artillery shells into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seoul, a city of 10 million people, every 20 seconds.
