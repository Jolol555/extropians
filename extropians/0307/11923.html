From:Andrew Clough
<br>
<p>...When a reduction in atmospheric CO2 progresses far enough, the 
<br>
polar caps grow, and the increased albedo from them further cools the
<br>
Earth 
<br>
in a runaway process that ends with our planet becoming one big 
<br>
snowball.  This seems to have happened several times in the distant
<br>
past, 
<br>
put with massive death among photosynthesizers, the CO2 released from 
<br>
volcanos (that's where inducted carbon eventually ends up) built up
<br>
enough 
<br>
to reverse the process...
<br>
<p><p>The process you are describing is the sputtering gasping
<br>
end of life on an earthlike planet.  I agree that some
<br>
carbon can be freed by volcanos, but over the long haul
<br>
volcanos become ever scarcer, as does the free carbon.
<br>
<p>For every lifeform we have today, there was something
<br>
bigger and better in the Jurassic: dinosaurs in place of
<br>
our lions, for instance, and those big honking dragonflies,
<br>
oh my!  Life was almost finished on this planet when we 
<br>
came along and saved it all.  Not Gaia, not an expanded
<br>
sun, it was technological capable humans.  Take a bow,
<br>
friends, our kind saved the planet.
