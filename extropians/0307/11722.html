...
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;...[newly ethical investors suddenly began] demanding that their

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Anders Sandberg:  Hmm, why do you think this is Miller's position? In
<br>
the story it was the demand from the Catholic Church (where the list
<br>
certainly seem 
<br>
plausible). But where is the evidence that this is Miller's view?...
<br>
<p><p>Ja, and this makes my point even stronger, for it
<br>
suggests that the catholic church would have a
<br>
unified view on these topics.  They *might* have
<br>
a fairly unified view on pornography, but the rest of
<br>
the topics would all have a wide spread of opinions
<br>
within any group of devout catholics.  Even if this
<br>
group were unified by a blind devotion to the
<br>
pope, there would still be a wide divergence
<br>
of opinion and action.
<br>
<p>The actual mechanism I am thinking about is the
<br>
projection of one's sense of ethics onto a group
<br>
or humanity.  If one projects in this way, one
<br>
might come to the conclusion that those who invest
<br>
in those six areas Miller gives are doing so against
<br>
their conscience.  I suspect most people already
<br>
invest in accordance with their conscience.  I
<br>
I cannot see why one would do otherwise, for there 
<br>
are plenty of companies in which to invest, regardless 
<br>
of one's position on the political or ethical spectrum.  
<br>
<p>Unfortunately ethical standards are not universal or 
<br>
objective.  If they were, what an easy world this would 
<br>
be.  To that end, I make the following modest proposal:
<br>
that all humanity adopt my view of ethics and morality.  
<br>
Then everyone would agree, wars would cease, societies
<br>
would prosper, etc.  Will all 6E9 of you agree
<br>
to that?
