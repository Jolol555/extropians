<p>
This is very bad news, I hope that the appeal is successful. I can
<br>
understand the logic bu which the lawyer chose to defend the legality of
<br>
freezing as a way of burial, instead of trying to defend the idea of
<br>
cryonics itself. The lawyer must have thought that insisting on something
<br>
controversial like cryonics was not a good strategy.
<br>
But, see things from this point of view. A corpse is an &quot;object&quot; to be
<br>
disposed of as quickly, safely and inexpensively as possible (remember,
<br>
France is a secular country, probably much less than the US). So choosing
<br>
how to bury a corpse is not a big ethical issue, and from the point of view
<br>
of a magistrate the best is just following what the current law says.
<br>
Insisting on cryonics, the right to hope to be revived, etc., would turn it
<br>
into an ethical issue. Perhaps this is a better strategy.

Subject: Re: Precisions on the Martinot situation
<br>
<p><p>Hi there,
<br>
<p>This is just to follow on my last report (September 2002, below) from
<br>
France on the Martinot situation (cryonically frozen couple), and the
<br>
legal battle linked to the legality of cryonics in France.
<br>
<p>The (bad, but expected) news is that Thursday (July 17, 03), the
<br>
decision on the Nantes appeal (&quot;administrative court&quot;) was given and
<br>
it said freezing was not a legal way to bury people.
<br>
<p>(For best and worse, the lawyer chose to defend the legality of
<br>
freezing as a way of burial, instead of trying to defend the idea of
<br>
cryonics itself.)
<br>
<p>The lawyer, as he had already announced, said he would appeal to the
<br>
&quot;Conseil d'Etat&quot; (highest administrative juridiction), and then, if
<br>
needed, to the Court of HUman Rights.
<br>
<p>See below my previous report if you want more precisions (my comments
<br>
there still apply).
<br>
<p>Best things to all
<br>
<p>Jacques
<br>
<p><p><p>Jacques Du Pasquier a écrit (10.9.2002/18:43) :
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm back with more details (I'm not a jurist, I hope I got it right)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and some reflections. The situation is slightly more complicated, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't look particularly good within the French juridiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On one hand, the Prefet of Maine-et-Loire, in April 02, willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proceed to the burial of the Martinots, got a decision in that sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Cour d'Angers. Rémy Martinot appealed to it as you remember, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Prefet waited for the decision on the appeal, which was due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yesterday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, another court, &quot;Tribunal administratif de
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nantes&quot;(*), had to judge, more generally, whether congelation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constituted a proper and lawful burial. (That's the way they frame the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation obviously.) Turns out they said no. That's bad. That was on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thursday, and they justified it through the &quot;General Code of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Collectivities&quot; that says a dead body has to be cremated or inhumated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rémy Martinot appealed to that decision, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So yesterday, Cour d'Angers, instead of saying to the Prefet that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could, or could not proceed, said that it would wait for the decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Nantes appeal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The decision on the Nantes appeal can take up to 6 months.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If *that* decision is negative, Rémy Martinot's lawyer says they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seize the &quot;Conseil d'état&quot;, which in France is the highest authority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on administrative conflicts (and also adviser to the President).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Conseil d'Etat already rejected an appeal on a situation with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preservation of a body in ice; however it doesn't seem that in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case cryonics was intended. It was more like: keeping the body around,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without any hope of reviving it ever. So obviously one should plead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is NOT a burial (otherwise they will make the same decision).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rémy's lawyer said he was confident, because the situation here was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally different. (But...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the Conseil d'Etat says no, then last resort is to go the European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Court of HUman Rights, which they say they will if needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I really hope that they plead the deep problem, that they make a case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for cryonics as something that is, though of course far from certain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely rational, and not just a funerary rite among others. I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmitted to the lawyer several documents to that effect, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an article by Ralph Merkle (suggested by Robert), documentation on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alcor and Cryonics Institute, names of reputed people taking cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe if a lawyer really getting it would get in touch that would help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit? I feel that Alain Fouquet, Rémy's lawyer, needs some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encouragement to the effect that, yes, there is really a good case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it's possible to win. If you need contact info (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telephone) for the lawyer, just ask me. I have provided my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encouragement, and he thanked me for that, but more encouragement, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from people who are part of the juridical world, might be useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Conseil d'Etat are probably intelligent folks, and one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeed in explaining to them this should not be considered as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burial, but as a situation that had not been considered in the making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of current law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jacques
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (*) In France, you have specific courts for judging conflicts between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the citizens and administration. Apparently it is not the same in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anglo-saxon countries. (Sorry if this is so obvious for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; juridically literate. Or if it's wrong.)
