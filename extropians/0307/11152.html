From:  J Corbally
<br>
<p>...The motorcycle (and the scooter, of course) are working mens' 
<br>
machines.  Perhaps since the rider doesn't have a car, the woman 
<br>
subconciously realizes that he's poorly paid...James...
<br>
<p>With this I must beg to differ.  The biker may
<br>
appear as one who is well paid, for she has
<br>
enough money left over to have this machine,
<br>
most probably in addition to a car. 
<br>
<p>I just returned from the annual Independence 
<br>
Day rally in Hollister taxifornia.  There were
<br>
an estimated 80-100 thousand bikes there.  Most
<br>
of these were Harleys, many of them were verrry
<br>
expensive customs, nearly all of them recreational
<br>
vehicles in the sense that they were clearly
<br>
not everyday transportation.  
<br>
<p>A very conservative estimate would value the
<br>
bikes at 10k each.  So the attendees at that
<br>
rally represented over a billllion dollars in
<br>
strictly recreational vehicles, lots of expensive
<br>
custom paint and decorative pieces, fancy 
<br>
butt-jewelry.  
<br>
<p>This is the reason I go down there every year,
<br>
to witness firsthand all this exuberant waste.
<br>
It fills me shock and awe, seeing what can be
<br>
accomplished given freedom, democracy and good
<br>
old unfettered capitalism.  Ahhh, life is 
<br>
gooood.
