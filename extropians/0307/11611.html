<p>Mike was speaking of ExI and extropians, not the list.  Because you do not 
<br>
&quot;know what many of you do offline...&quot; is the reason I am responding.  I 
<br>
don't know why it is difficult to comprehend that this list is not 
<br>
comprised of only extropians.  There are people on this list who are not 
<br>
extropians and this list is not reflective of all extropians.
<br>
<p>When you state that &quot;extropians&quot; are &quot;about the most non-action-oriented 
<br>
people ...&quot; I take issue.
<br>
<p>Let me explain my thinking.  In the business world, a person and his or her 
<br>
company is more inclined to brand and market the company than the 
<br>
philosophical organization he or she is a member of.  This is common 
<br>
business practice.  This is what has occurred for ExI.
<br>
<p>Many of our members and those on the board, and advisors are highly action 
<br>
oriented people.  They are so busy pushing, marketing and promoting their 
<br>
own company, that they are not on tv, radio or in print stating the 
<br>
affiliation or promotion of ExI.  This is done all the time.
