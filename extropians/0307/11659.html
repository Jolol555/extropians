If I were 20 again I would probably be dreaming of making someday a very,
<br>
very direct contribution to the development of ultratechnologies to take us
<br>
much closer to posthumanity. Something like leading the development of the
<br>
first conscious AI, or leading the development of a super ultra MRI at 1
<br>
nanometer resolution that permits uploading consciousness.
<br>
At a certain point most of us realize that they will never have the skill,
<br>
or the time, or simply that they will never be at the right place at the
<br>
right moment to play this kind of role. At the same time we can all do
<br>
things to facilitate the task of those few lucky persons who are or will be
<br>
in such a position.
<br>
Something we all can do is promoting the acceptance of the coming of
<br>
posthumanity, spreading the meme. Try saying to friends &quot;Well it is quite
<br>
likely that in 50 years with AI nanotech and stuff people do not have to die
<br>
anymore, one is able to switch sex at will, telepathy will be achieved by
<br>
plugging organic brains in the wireless net, ...&quot; and see what sort of
<br>
horrified response you get even from very bright people.
<br>
They will say &quot;death is noble and gives meaning to life&quot;, and things like
<br>
this. Now what is this bullshit? There is still a lot of work to do in order
<br>
to make the majority see as reasonable options those things that we consider
<br>
as evident.
<br>
Perhaps trying to propagate our ideas in a measured and reasonable way is
<br>
already enough.

<em>&gt; &gt; I hinted at the answer above, but it should seem obvious now what it

must

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; balanced against the other; all of them are taken to their &quot;logical

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more fulfilling than I realize; maybe I'll get hooked and become an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ascetic instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps my imagination is simply drained, but it's hard to see what kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of work I can usefully do in my free time, to contribute to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ultratechnologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But is contributing to the ultratechnologies the best way of furthering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman goals? There are certainly some technologies that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit from more people tinkering, and some transhumanists that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well into relevant technologies and developing them. But then there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the project: we need to make sure these technologies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usable for transhuman goals, and not just furthering of current human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals (or even worse, dangerous or subhumanity-causing). Here we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people participating in the public debate to make the transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position acceptable at the negotiation table, here we need people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysing stuff on all scales to point out possibilities and threats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here we need people trying out different solutions, technologies and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social networks to see what works and what doesn't work. And of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be great to have more people with funding opportunities within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this ideological sphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of this is &quot;activism&quot; and some of it is &quot;scholarship&quot;. But there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also plenty of room of being an entrepreneur and a transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (selling something transhuman, making money that can be used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman ways or just having a transhumanism friendly organisation) or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even doing it from the inside of an organisation (sure, foobar corp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not care the least about transhumanity, but if the marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department has a transhumanist flair or the research department
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the importance of nanotech the effects can be rather good -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all involved).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I see it the question &quot;how can I get involved?&quot; can be turned into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question-tree: &quot;Can I turn my current activities and interests into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something more useful? If not, do I want to change them in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction?&quot;. Most people are going to find that the first step actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives plenty of room for practical action.
