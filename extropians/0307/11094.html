I was in a hurry when I posted my one-liner.
<br>
Let me deal with this in a little more detail.

<em>&gt; The reflected photon would have the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequency as the pre-reflection photon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only if the light source and the reflector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are stationary with respect to each other.
</em><br>
<p>...Is this actually the case?...
<br>
<p>Ja.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;...Has it been 
<br>
observed experimentally with stationary 
<br>
versus moving mirrors?...
<br>
<p>Ja.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;...Certainly we've 
<br>
heard of radiation that has been Doppler-shifted 
<br>
red or blue from radiation sources moving
<br>
towards or away--respectively--from the 
<br>
observer.  Is a moving reflector equivalent to a
<br>
moving emitter?...
<br>
<p>Ja.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;...What are the differences between
<br>
these two radiation-'manifesting' processes?  And what
<br>
are the differences between the reflection(1) we
<br>
associate with mirrors (metallic and dielectric), and
<br>
the reflection(2) we associate with, say, the moon,
<br>
which seems more rightly a case of absorption and
<br>
re-emission?...
<br>
<p>Oy.  Jeff I hope I get to your question here by saying
<br>
what you need is to remember is momentum is
<br>
conserved, same with reflected photons as with any 
<br>
other collision.  You know that the momentum of a
<br>
photon is h*(nu)/c.  If one collides with your
<br>
motor home it will appear from the point of view
<br>
of the driver to have the same frequency when it
<br>
leaves as when it arrives.  Of course the photon
<br>
is slightly blue shifted from the drivers view
<br>
compared to the cop's view.  The difference between
<br>
the frequency the cop sees and what the driver sees
<br>
is doubled, and that is the blue shift the radar gun
<br>
sees.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>...Consider the solar sail when first unfurled.  If it
<br>
were in a conventional stable orbit, with no radial
<br>
velocity relative to the sun, would there then be no
<br>
force arising from 'radiation pressure'?...
<br>
<p><p>No.  Assume the sail of just the right density that
<br>
the force due to light pressure exactly equals the
<br>
force due to the sun's gravity.  The sail hovers,
<br>
stationary with respect to the sun, no work is done,
<br>
no frequency shift of the reflected photons.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p>...I've just finished
<br>
reading a few web pages on radiation pressure.  It
<br>
seems a fairly established phenomenon, with both
<br>
heavyweight theoretical
<br>
foundation--Maxwell--<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure</a>
<br>
and experimental confirmation...
<br>
<p><p>Ja, these are all well understood physical phenomena.
<br>
Thomas Gold can access many good texts on the subject.
<br>
I looked over his site briefly and saw several areas
<br>
which look erroneous or incomplete.  Solar sails are
<br>
not perfect reflectors.  Standard theory has a factor
<br>
which describes what fraction of the sun's energy is
<br>
reflected.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>...So, will an observer traveling with the solar sail
<br>
observe an alteration in frequency of the incoming and
<br>
outgoing radiation?...
<br>
<p><p>No.  The astronaut on board the solar sail sees the
<br>
same frequency incoming and outgoing.  The observer
<br>
on the sun sees a redshifted spectrum if the sail is
<br>
moving away and blue shifted if the sail is inbound.
<br>
Note that in practice a solar sail would actually
<br>
orbit the sun, then orient itself at some angle, say
<br>
pi/4 to spiral away from or spiral towards the sun.
<br>
That way, there is no need to have the sail so thin
<br>
that its mass per unit area is less than the light
<br>
pressure from the sun.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Does starlight from a receding or approaching star change frequency
<br>
when reflected in an earthbound mirror?
<br>
<p><p>Ja, of course.  Starlight is no different from
<br>
any other kind of light.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If the reflector is moving away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light source, there is clearly gravitational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential energy coming from somewhere.
</em><br>
<p>...Yesiree.  Everything suggests a pressure, a force over
<br>
an area, a transfer of and increase in momentum, and a consequent
<br>
inescapable increase in energy, some combination of potential:out of the
<br>
gravity well, and kenetic--increase in velocity.  The question remains,
<br>
where's the energy coming from?...
<br>
<p><p>The reflected photons have transferred some of their
<br>
energy to the sail.  That's why they are red shifted,
<br>
assuming the sail is outbound.  If the sail is inbound,
<br>
the photons are blueshifted, higher frequency, higher
<br>
energy.
<br>
<p><p><p>...It seems logical to look to the incident radiation for
<br>
the source of the energy.  I would be looking for less
<br>
energy coming 'out' in the reflected radiation, than
<br>
went in, originally...
<br>
<p>Exactly so, Jeff.  Whats the mystery?  
<br>
<p><p><p><p>...Now, I've seen one of these gadgets, and the little
<br>
vanes do indeed turn away from the blackened side and
<br>
in the direction of the silvered side.  Clearly the
<br>
'radiation pressure' on the silvered side, with a high
<br>
degree of reflection, is no match for the competing
<br>
force generated, presumably, from the absorption,
<br>
heating, and reemission from the blackened side...
<br>
<p><p>No.  Light pressure is verrrrry small compared to
<br>
the force generated by air inside the bulb being
<br>
heated more on the black side than on the cooler
<br>
silvered side.  If you took one of those things, pulled 
<br>
a sufficiently strong vacuum on it and shined a
<br>
sufficiently strong light, it *would* turn the
<br>
other way.
<br>
<p>This would be provable with something as simple
<br>
as a vacuum bell jar.  Drill a hole in the
<br>
bulb, keep the light source steady and watch the
<br>
spinner slow as the pressure in the bell jar
<br>
drops.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>...Would a better solar sail result if the inward-facing
<br>
side were blackened and the outward side silvered?...
<br>
<p><p><p><p>No.  A solar sail doesn't have a blackened side.  One
<br>
cannot afford the weight hit of such a thing, even if
<br>
it were useful for some reason, which it isn't.
<br>
<p>Gold's Carnot cycle argument comes apart when one
<br>
realizes how very little actual energy we are extracting
<br>
from the photons.  It really isn't much, and the final
<br>
resulting accumulated gravitational potential energy
<br>
isn't much.  The magic of the solar sail is that the sun
<br>
is providing both the energy source and the propellant
<br>
(the photons) so the spacecraft neednt haul the stuff
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>Again I urge you, young man, consult the established
<br>
texts on this topic.  The smart guys have figured 
<br>
this stuff out.  Everything's hard till ya know how to 
<br>
do it, Jeff.  We know how to do this one.
