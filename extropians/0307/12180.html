<p>
One serious but unaddressed problem with building a
<br>
&quot;free state&quot; in today's world is that the existing
<br>
states will not let you.
<br>
<p>In a Free State, one would presumeably be free to do
<br>
whatever non-aggressive thing one wanted.  Otherwise,
<br>
what point?  Use or sale of drugs is non-aggressive. 
<br>
How long would it take for one of the existing drug
<br>
cartels to move in and set up operations, perfectly
<br>
peacefully and very likely spreading a piece of their
<br>
$billions around to make sure that everyone was happy
<br>
and probably behaving like the most perfect neighbor
<br>
you could possibly want?  
<br>
<p>How long would it then take for one of the major
<br>
terrorist nations - for example, the U.S.A. - to move
<br>
in militarily, as it has elsewhere all over the globe,
<br>
to enforce its own version of public policy - killing
<br>
drug dealers and anyone who supports them or gets in
<br>
the way, and supporting gangs of local thugs to keep
<br>
their own hands relatively clean?  
<br>
<p>After all, they've already killed a few hundred
<br>
thousand people (conservatively) directly or
<br>
indirectly in various parts of SE Asia or Central or
<br>
S. America, and thoroughly destroyed several fairly
<br>
advanced 2nd world cultures without any particular
<br>
qualms, plus of course putting more people behind bars
<br>
here in the land of freedom, both total and
<br>
percentagewise, than any other nation on the earth,
<br>
all to protect us from our own choices of what to put
<br>
in our bodies.
<br>
<p>There are other examples...  &quot;Kiddy Porn,&quot; of course. 
<br>
Another purely &quot;public policy&quot; law.  Recall that they
<br>
justify it on the basis that a market in it finances
<br>
the exploitation of children.  The owner or seller
<br>
does not personally have to have done anything
<br>
whatsoever to any &quot;child,&quot; and the images can even be
<br>
of 20-somethings made up to appear younger, or
<br>
completely computer generated, for that matter.  (And
<br>
of course the definition of &quot;child&quot; is purely
<br>
arbitrary as well.  Most 14 yr. old girls would be
<br>
married in most primitive societies, as they are
<br>
commonly today in rural Mexico.)  But, public policy
<br>
uber alles.
<br>
<p>And, as a non-U.S. citizen, members of this &quot;free
<br>
state&quot; will not qualify now, under the new
<br>
interpretation of &quot;rights&quot; by the U.S. state, for
<br>
basic human rights, in total contradiction of the
<br>
entire basis of the U.S. Constitution, yes, of course,
<br>
but so what?  The Bush Administration has finally
<br>
managed to get de facto and de jure recognition of the
<br>
principle that &quot;rights&quot; are something that the state
<br>
grants you, and, as such, are whatever the law
<br>
defines.  
<br>
<p>That's the implicit meaning of denying the application
<br>
of basic rights - as in the Bill of Rights - to
<br>
non-U.S. citizens.  That's the whole real point of
<br>
detaining those people in the concentration camp in
<br>
Guantanamo.  If being a non-citizen means you have no
<br>
rights, then rights must be something artificial -
<br>
like incorporation - which is a fiat of the state.  If
<br>
so, then the only questions are those of legality. 
<br>
Clearly if rights is just another name for due
<br>
process, then why would we need a &quot;free state&quot;?  And,
<br>
what, if anything, would the term mean?  We are
<br>
already perfectly free, almost by definition - free to
<br>
do anything legal.
