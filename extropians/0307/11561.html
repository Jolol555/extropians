<p><em>&gt;Interesting point. I think this is part of the truth (I see the average

</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is also a hint that we might be better off without &quot;fair weather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropians&quot;.  There was a technological determinism-optimism of 90s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhumanism that I have come to think of as both naive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;passivating.  It is not dynamic optimism: it is passive optimism.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the singularity is coming and Wired is always right, what use is there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of doing anything except cheerleading?
</em><br>
<p>I think we have been very practical, that is why we have moved from being 
<br>
naive cheerleaders of a possible future and now learning ways of actually 
<br>
making our ideas come to fruition by careful application and choosing our 
<br>
battles wisely.
<br>
<p>I don't think that our optimism is passive, I think it is a more matured 
<br>
sense of reality and rather than running here and running there trying to 
<br>
produce this and that and get so many  members and have so many conferences 
<br>
.... (like a mouse in a cage running on the treadmill), that many of us are 
<br>
actually getting to the next levels of how to communicate, where to 
<br>
communicate and what to communicate.
<br>
<p>For example, being conserving energy and considering emotional 
<br>
sustainability, it is far better to not debate each and every biotechnology 
<br>
Luddite.  Consider the recent debate with Greg Stock and George Annas. Greg 
<br>
was cool and stayed with the point, while Annas's augment zigzagged from 
<br>
space exploration to sodomizing children - totally off topic. Because of 
<br>
this, he lost a lot of credibility in the debating circle.  His insults, 
<br>
finger pointing and sneering at Greg were so unappealing, while Greg stayed 
<br>
calm (maybe a bit too calm), and even if he missed the opportunity to nail 
<br>
Annas on some of his ridiculous points, he did conserve his dignity.  Greg 
<br>
came out as the winner of the debate.
<br>
<p>In sum:  I'd rather be quoted in one paragraph of reason in a 3-page 
<br>
article about hyperbole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Dynamic optimism is about actually doing something constructive. Sure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the IT sector is not doing great. But then we better invent new killer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apps or find ways of using the existing in better ways. With cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programming labor many new projects can be implemented that were too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive before.  Cryonics doesn't work? Too bad, let's find another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solution. People are not acknowledging Drexler in nanotechnology? Write
</em><br>
<em>&gt;papers that do. Investments went bad? Start over, a bit more cautiously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Biotech is under regulatory and luddite attack. So? Go out and defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it!
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Practice practical optimism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Personally I am *more* optimistic about the transhuman future today than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was just three years ago. We are finally starting to grow up.
</em><br>
<p>Me to.
