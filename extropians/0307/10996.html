<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I've been finding continuing thinking on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nature of consciousness quite unsettling. The problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Axiom: I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tenuous hypothesis 1: I have sensory input implying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other stuff, and so it  is too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tenuous hypothesis 2: I am part of the set of other stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (much deduction, investigation, leading to negation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concept of conscious self; self is an illusion, &quot;I&quot; am just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a pattern of information)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find that if I take Tenuous Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; axioms, I produce the result:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Result: I am not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how you get to your result from 1 and 2.
</em><br>
<p>I've not included any of the reasoning here; basically, it is &quot;insert
<br>
materialist argument X&quot;. When I talk about &quot;I&quot;, I refer to the fundamental
<br>
sense of self that I assume we all experience, which seems to have no
<br>
information processing component, yet is accessible to the information
<br>
processing component (because I can talk about it!). I can't find any role,
<br>
or mechanism, for a non-information processing component to consciousness.
<br>
The materialist point of view would be, I think, that it therefore cannot
<br>
exist (or at least can't be part of the model?).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not posit:  &quot;I&quot; whatever &quot;I&quot; am, am party a self referential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes or even set of processes. The &quot;I&quot; may not be a singular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process it may be a plurality. Perhaps some of these processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contained in what we term crudely call the &quot;self&quot; are recursively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of the other processes in the &quot;self&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I have no doubt that the information processing aspect of self aware systems
<br>
works like this. The biggest problem, imo, is that it doesn't imply a sense
<br>
of self like that experienced by other humans (or me, at least). You could
<br>
posit a self aware intelligent system without a &quot;consiousness&quot;, without it
<br>
being a zombie bicycle. 
<br>
<p>In short, there is something in there, the sense of &quot;I&quot;, which shouldn't be
<br>
there, yet which is the source of the fundamental axiom underpinning all my
<br>
goal systems, the basis for everything that the mundane, information
<br>
processing aspects of me strive for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We don't doubt we are multicellular though we talk of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a body. Perhaps consciousness is a sets of precesses and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refer to the self as though it is a singular thing is to make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake as to assume our body is a single thing. 
</em><br>
<p>I can't explain even one sense of self, let alone many of them.
<br>
<p>In the case of the body, the deconstruction explanation works; it doesn't
<br>
leave anything out. Vitalism doesn't cut the mustard. However, consciousness
<br>
is different, because it is something; in some important sense it is the
<br>
only thing. You can't leave it out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstraction at the body level and the &quot;self&quot; level losses too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail. Maybe.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; By my original axiom, I now have A and ~A. I've just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flushed reality down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the toilet. What is existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't fault the materialist viewpoint, because I can't support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alternative; the closer I look, the more it appears that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible role at all for any proposed non-physical piece of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So intelligent thought is a purely physical phenomenon, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processing. Which means that &quot;I&quot; am not; &quot;I&quot; am an illusion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (fooling who?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can only find paradox at the base of any search for an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only phenomenon in the universe that I can definitely call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axiomatic (that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am). To me, it is more clearly evident than the existence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But apparently it cannot be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Help.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course it is correct that we do not yet know as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we should on brain and consciousness. At the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the point that I am trying to make is independent of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular mechanism of consciousness:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Question A: does the uploaded copy of person X wake up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinking and feeling that (s)he is X? Does (s)he feel continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with X (going to sleep - waking up)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes and yes. Assuming, as we have been, that the upload works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed the test of whether the upload has worked is likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; does Xprime think (s)he is X and does everyone else relate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Xprime as X.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a scientific question that can be answered with a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment: just ask the uploaded copy of X. I assume the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answer depends on the details of a uploading technology, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how much and what kind of information it is able to copy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restore. I think this technology is a few decades away at least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it seems reasonable to think that it will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed sooner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, the uploading technology is unlikely to be *built* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; be designed. Seems we are unlikely to be satisfied with the design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; until we have a better understanding of what we take for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; and the &quot;self&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Question B: assuming that the answer to Question A is yes (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uploaded copy feels that (s)he is X), is (s)he REALLY X?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This does not look like a scientific question, since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its formulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is such that it cannot be verified or falsified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Agreed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem:  There are certain propositions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that are true that cannot be proven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think the consciousness of any other person you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is a scientifically veriable hypothesis? I think it can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; be inferred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think your own is even to you? I think it can only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; assumed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Without assuming it you have *no base* from which to formulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; scientific questions or any other types of questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course we still tend to feel uneasy: when it comes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone is the Most Selfish Individual. We cannot help thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that Question B matters very much. The answer that I choose is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it does not matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A leap of faith?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can accept as a continuation of my current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identity any conscious being who thinks that he is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of my current identity. I could not go to sleep if I could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accept this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A leap of faith for peace of mind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brett:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because I don't *know* enough about how my consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the experience of self-hood manifests to assume 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persist completely decoupled from a matter substrate for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; length of time. My current thinking is no substrate means no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conscious processing (or unconscious processing either). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness process means no self concept process. In short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I assume that no brain means a discontinuation of me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems prudent to do so.
