<p><em>&gt; I've resisted posting on this subject because my viewpoint is largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anecdotal, and I don't have a great deal of grounding in the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics of the situation. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, each account helps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My sister was sent to one of the programs related to Tranquility.
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have never been so insulted in my life as when my parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invited me to comment on the 'positive changes' in my sister. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She talked slowly, detailing all the wrongs she had visited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on me, without ever taking her eyes off the floor. I read 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their textbooks, which were a mix of deprecating language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on adolescence, and evangelical Christian theory....
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I have never been more proud of my younger sister, as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day that my parents told me she had fought her way out of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; center, and made good her escape into the blue sky, and left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a string of black eyes and clawed guards in her wake. She 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not return for a year, after my parents promised to never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; betray her like that again.
</em><br>
<p>I would like to know what caused the parents to have a 
<br>
change of heart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure how I would have reacted, had my parents done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same to me. I'm glad I never had to find out(possibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because at the time I was growing up, my parents didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the means to do so.) and I don't think that anyone should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to. These 'centers' and 'schools' are nothing but abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed because children can be beaten without cause. As the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policeman who handcuffed my sister and led her away early one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saturday said 'you're under eighteen, you only have the rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your parents decide to give you'. I didn't know then what she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was in for. If I had, maybe I would have spoken up. I'm sorry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I didn't anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you weren't very old yourself.  Just how bad had her
<br>
behavior been?
<br>
<p>As I agree with you and the others on the easier cases,
<br>
let's take a hard one.  The following is entirely made
<br>
up, and is only loosely based on ideas in the article
<br>
that began this thread.
<br>
<p>A Hard Case
<br>
<p>Before us sits a 25 year old man, who testifies as follows
<br>
as to the effectiveness and propriety of kidnapping actions
<br>
taken against him by his parents and their employees when
<br>
he was fifteen:
<br>
<p>&quot;Listen, I am not the same person that I was then. I was
<br>
an arrogant little asshole, who utterly had failed to
<br>
develop properly.  Ask my brothers and sisters, if you
<br>
don't believe me. Unlike my parents' other six children,
<br>
something had to be wrong with me. The third youngest,
<br>
from everyone's earliest memories I simply could not get
<br>
along with other people, be it here at home or in school
<br>
or at church.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think now that myelination happened in me pathologically
<br>
slowly (though I am not a medical person and have had no
<br>
training), but somehow I just could not see other people's
<br>
points of view.  It was a complete lacuna.  Not only was I
<br>
in every way inconsiderate of others, but some demon in me
<br>
would actually cause me to go out of my way to torment them
<br>
and to, to put in in a word, cause trouble. I enjoyed it.
<br>
I needed the attention and the stimulation.  The harm alone
<br>
that I inflicted on myself is almost unbelievable, and yet
<br>
I could not stop.  I did not want to stop.
<br>
<p>&quot;Fortunately, through their love for me, my family and their
<br>
friends bought the very best. Sadly, it had to be out of our
<br>
country, because busybodies in the state capitol have enacted
<br>
laws wherein they can meddle in family business, in ways that
<br>
do not concern anyone outside our family.  This was very
<br>
expensive, and I want personally to do what I can to repay
<br>
my friends and relatives who helped me.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now, you are undoubtedly asking, 'Why should we believe you
<br>
and not the 15 old that you were'?  It's true.  I did happen
<br>
to be very articulate as a 15 year old, and would have passed
<br>
all the usual measures of ability given to adults. In a sense,
<br>
you have destroyed the person that was, and I have been born
<br>
instead. I am not the same person, but you may ask, how is it
<br>
that your actions against who I was can in any way be justified?
<br>
<p>&quot;It is because of the destruction that I was committing against
<br>
everyone, against myself, and against everything and every
<br>
institution that I could think of. As a humanitarian, you ought
<br>
to take that into account when pushing your vaunted &quot;principles&quot;.
<br>
There is a reason that human societies have traditionally had
<br>
at least two classes of people demarked by age: adults and
<br>
children. It is the wisdom of our current civilization that
<br>
adults are given privileges that are denied children.  I am
<br>
not against all experimentation, but I can see in my own case
<br>
the benefits of the actions that the people who love me took.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Well, so who are we going to believe?  Him, or his 15 year old
<br>
former self?  How are we in our infinite wisdom, going to 
<br>
implement the laws and agencies to oversee what happens between
<br>
members of private groups of individuals/citizens?
<br>
<p>Lee
