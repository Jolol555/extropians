</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with 16,000 lives per year from drunk drivers [2] and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than ~1000 lives per year (for the last three years) from

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of terrorism.
</em><br>
<p>From the stats in your attached URLs, it would seem to me that even road
<br>
accidents are negligable. Heart disease &amp; cancer (and age related conditions
<br>
that are hidden by those two biggies, presumably) are clearly the biggest
<br>
concern from the standpoint of a rational observer.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But I would doubt that in terms of the allocation of budget
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars that would seem to be the case.  [And Emlyn --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even talk to me about AU -- terrorism deaths --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering the incident in Bali are probably something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a hundred or so per year -- based on a several year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average -- and I'd hate to consider what the Driving Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Influence stats would be.]
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree. But I've thought all the way along that the threat of
<br>
terrorism has been wildly overstated, and while it does exist to some
<br>
extent, is far less problematic than AIDS, for example. The far bigger
<br>
threat from terrorism, IMO, is that it's working; we are all acting out of
<br>
fear, and destroying the great societies in which we live in the process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the point is well taken -- as was the case with SARS we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a situation where some of the potential impacts cause a much greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice than others.  What we should be looking for is a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale and some way of presenting it.  From my (extropic?) perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the greater the risk to humanity, the greater should be the perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk from a hazard.

<p>From my perspective, it's all about statistical risk, coloured by one's
<br>
personal behaviour. It seems obvious to me that the freedoms we are allowing
<br>
to erode now in the name of the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; are in no way justified
<br>
by the risks.
