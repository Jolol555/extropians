<p>Less safe than 10 years.  Ten years ago, post cold war, I had far more hopes 
<br>
for the world becoming a much more progressive, rational and prosperous 
<br>
place.  For a while it almost seemed like it would be so.  Ten years ago I 
<br>
had more faith that people in the US understood freedom and its importance 
<br>
and were willing to dismantle government bloat and control of their lives.   
<br>
Ten years ago I had more freedoms that were not under direct attack by my own 
<br>
government.  
<br>
<p>Much the same can be said for 20 years ago except that the cold war was still 
<br>
on and there was the non-zero possibility of nuclear armaggedon.  
<br>
<p>Ten years in the future is a guessing game.  It very much depends on whether 
<br>
we grow beyond the almost total centering of all our policies on fear.  It 
<br>
depends on whether we create a vision of the future that unites us 
<br>
successfully.  If we fail in this then I think we will be vastly less safe 10 
<br>
years from now than today.
<br>
<p>The major threat to my lifestyle/exsitence at this time is from my own 
<br>
government.  The real erosion of rights and freedom and the vast planned 
<br>
expansion of government surveillance and control capabilities are a very 
<br>
serious threat to my plans and the plans of anyone who may be at or near the 
<br>
cutting edge of change.  
<br>
<p>I don't think the &quot;death sentence over our head&quot; will be fixed by top-down 
<br>
government control and dominantion.   I don't think that it will be happened 
<br>
by hyping our fears incessantly and acting from them.
