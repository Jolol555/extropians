<em>&gt; It seems to me that an alternative hypothesis should be entertained: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are greatly self-deceived about what we want.  Maybe the things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we actually want are typically not as noble as the things we want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that we want.  Maybe we really want social approval more than we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit, for example.  But believing ourselves to be noble may help us to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince others that we are noble, and so to convince them to associate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with us.  Also, we may want to believe that our career/spouse/etc. is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the sort of career or spouse we wanted, so that we can reassure our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associates that we are not considering switching careers/spouses/etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This alternative hypothesis suggests that most literary journeys of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-discovery are really aids to self-delusion, helping people tell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves comforting stories about themselves.  Real journeys of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-discovery would largely be dark affairs, wherein mounting evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced people to believe ignoble things about themselves that they would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather not tell others.  And those who do struggle over decades to learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth about what people want, and who are willing to tell others, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would face largely indifferent or hostile audiences.  Young optimists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have evolved to ignore the claims of old cynics, since the young 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimists of the past who did not were less attractive as mates and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associates.
</em><br>
<p>This definition of &quot;want&quot; seems to me to be one of the classically 
<br>
postulated failure modes in genie stories - defining what people &quot;really 
<br>
want&quot; as including wants they would not want to want.  If someone does not 
<br>
want to want something, it is not &quot;help&quot; to satisfy that want.  I would 
<br>
say that volition and its satisfaction should be defined by taking the 
<br>
renormalized goal system into account, including people's aspirations to 
<br>
be better people.  It is not helpful if a genie defines your &quot;wish&quot; by 
<br>
reference to your dark, repressed desires, and in fact, it is not helpful 
<br>
if a genie defines your &quot;wish&quot; by inducing features of your apparent de 
<br>
facto preferences which you would reject if you understood them.
<br>
<p>What is the purpose of self-discovery if not self-alteration?
