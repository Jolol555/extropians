Some good calls among the dross (and stuff that could have happened if
<br>
people had chosen them)
<br>
<p>Men and women of 70 in A.D. 2000 look as if they were 40. Wrinkles, sagging
<br>
cheeks, leathery skins are curiosities or signs of neglect. The span of
<br>
life has been lengthened to 85. [no one would have believed it, but there
<br>
it is]
<br>
<p>Cancer is not yet curable in 2000. But physicians optimistically predict
<br>
that the time is not far off when it will be cured
<br>
<p>If old Mrs.Underwood, who lives around the corner from the Dobsons and who
<br>
was born in 1920 insists on sleeping under an old-fashioned comforter
<br>
instead of an aerogel blanket of glass puffed with air so that it is as
<br>
light as thistledown she must expect people to talk about her &quot;queerness.&quot;
<br>
<p>[that's rather like what Aussies call a `doona'; more to the point, if Mrs.
<br>
Underwood had slept under Mrs. Dobson, people would talk about her
<br>
queerness with a great deal more candor and less opprobrium than in 1950]
<br>
<p>Of course the Dobsons have a television set. But it is connected with the
<br>
telephones as well as with the radio receiver [almost gets the Internet, as
<br>
does:] a combination of calculating machine and forecaster. The calculator
<br>
solves thousands of separate equations in a minute; the automatic
<br>
forecaster carries out the computer's instructions and predicts the weather
<br>
from hour to hour. In 1950, meteorologists had no time to deal with the
<br>
50-odd variables that should have been mathematically handled to predict
<br>
the weather 24 hours in advance.
<br>
<p>It is a crime to burn raw coal and pollute air with smoke and soot. [we're
<br>
getting there]
<br>
<p>Jane Dobson has one of these electronic stoves. In eight seconds a
<br>
half-grilled frozen steak is thawed; in two minutes more it is ready to
<br>
serve. [forget the steak--nuke that pizza!]
<br>
<p>By 2000, supersonic planes cover a thousand miles an hour, but the
<br>
consumption of fuel is such that high fares have to be charged. In one of
<br>
these supersonic planes the Atlantic is crossed in three hours. [spot on,
<br>
but closed down a few years later]
<br>
<p>Nobody has yet circumnavigated the moon in a rocket space ship, but the
<br>
idea is not laughed down.
<br>
<p>[no, what's laughed down is the idea of going back there]
<br>
