</em><br>
<em>&gt;I worry that cryonics has been approached from the viewpoint of medicine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather than information theory.  Here is a point where lack of optimism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about post-Singularity capabilities may have killed people - cryonicists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking &quot;let's keep the neurons as undamaged as possible from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viewpoint of biological function&quot; rather than &quot;let's try and create a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical freezing process such that the configuration space of pre-frozen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brains is mapped to the configuration space of molecularly analyzed frozen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brains in a way that does not introduce information-loss on the level of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relevant functional information&quot;.  These are not at all the same thing; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one is concerned not with how much &quot;damage&quot; the freezing process does, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the viewpoint of ice crystal formation and so on, but rather with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question of whether ice crystal formation of just dumping a head into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;liquid nitrogen is a physical process that maps many initial states into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one final molecular-level state to a greater degree than the retraction of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;axons and dendrites that occurs if you leave the brain without oxygen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To give an example of how different the viewpoints are, slicing an area of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neural tissue in half and translating one of the pieces by several 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;millimeters is extremely destructive from a biological point of view, yet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if the slice is a good one and the translation is consistent, almost no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information has been lost - each point in the original configuration space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maps to a unique point in the new configuration space.  The question about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ice crystal formation is not how much &quot;damage&quot; it does to the neurons, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether as a physical process it tends to map distinct initial conditions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;onto distinct outcomes.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If dendrites and axons retract into the cell body within half an hour 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after the neuron has been starved of oxygen (!!!), 
</em><br>
<p>How do you know this?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;even so the essential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information *may* have been preserved; the question is whether scanning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the neuron on the *molecular level* would enable you to determine where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the original dendrites and axons were, to a degree necessary to reproduce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the functional information.  In turn, you can only determine this by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;running several possible dendritic configurations forward in time under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the retraction process, and seeing if several functionally different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;initial configurations map to exactly the same (molecularly the same) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;final retracted neuron.  If the mapping is nonunique, however, you're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably toast, unless the gross position of neurons is a constraint 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sufficient to reconstruct the functionally relevant information of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;original circuitry - if there is only one person you could have been such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that your neurons would have occupied that gross position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What determines this?  The degree to which precise details of the final 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post-freezing configuration constrain the original circuitry, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degree to which the constraint is global in nature rather than local, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relative to the functional space of brains.  For example, suppose that in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some area A1 we have a lossy mapping from a set of neural circuits N1 to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the post-freezing brainstate F1.  And suppose that the set of possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;initial neural circuits N1 that map to F1 contain possibilities that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functionally different from each other.  Are you dead meat?  Perhaps and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perhaps not.  Suppose that there is Shannon information between the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pre-freezing states of A1 and A2, such that if we know the pre-freezing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state of area A1, it would constrain the permissible states or probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distribution of area A2.  And suppose that, on a local level, there are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many different circuits N2 that could have frozen to the final state F2, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and some elements of N2 are functionally distinct from one another. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, there's only one possible element of N1 that is compatible with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible element of N2, and only one possible element of N2 that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compatible with that particular element in N1.  This is an idealized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example; you can have probability distributions that constrain and narrow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each other without this kind of definite certainty emerging from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inspection of a mere two areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The upshot is that if local areas of pre-frozen brains constrain one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another (relative to the space of functionally different brains) in a way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that survives mapping to frozen brains, such that local areas of frozen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brains constrain information globally rather than locally, then even large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;local blurs may not destroy global preservation of information.  If, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however, local areas do not strongly constrain one another, then even a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;small local blur may permanently destroy your mind-state.  All the locally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uncertain probability distributions will modularly add up to an extremely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uncertain global probability distribution, rather than many local 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uncertainties constraining each other to add up to global certainty.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;greater the *locality* of the brain, in other words, the more easily it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroyed by blurring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Blurring may be defined as mapping of functionally distinct local initial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions to physically identical local final states; or more formally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mapping such that the densest volumes of the probability distribution for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the final states tend to overlap one another even for functionally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinct initial conditions.  Whether a given degree of local blurring 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kills you will depend on the degree to which those functionally distinct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;local initial conditions permitted by the final local physical state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provide Shannon information about each other on a global scale, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether that Shannon information can constrain the whole brain to a single 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functional state or whether it only narrows the blur without managing to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eliminate it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It all boils down to the probability distributions for p(brain|mind) and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;p(frozen|brain), which together will determine p(mind|frozen).  As usual, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your life or death depends on - wait for it - Bayes' Theorem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So whether cryonics will work is a question that intersects biology, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics, and information theory, and the properties that determine whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you live or die are not at all obvious if you are thinking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anthropomorphically about &quot;preventing (biological) harm to neurons&quot;.  What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I worry about is not that cryonics has been misunderstood by the public, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but that it has been misunderstood by cryonicists.
