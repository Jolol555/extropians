<em>&gt; &gt;It seems a great pity that amongst the first things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent people often seem to get good at is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sarcasm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a useful ability whether u admit it or not.
</em><br>
<p>I definately *do* admit that it is a useful ability. I think
<br>
I am a perhaps a bit like Harvey in that I have an emotional
<br>
predispisiton towards people playing nice. I see it as 
<br>
efficient as well as pleasant. But given that people don't 
<br>
always play nice I am certainly willing to fall back on
<br>
the alternatives.
<br>
<p>Some folks, Voltaire comes to mind, perhaps Thomas
<br>
Huxley (Darwins Bulldog) can use sarcasm very effectively
<br>
in public forums. I would aspire to have such skills in
<br>
a political repertoire and hope to have to use them very
<br>
infrequently.
<br>
<p>I'm a rationalist humanist. I like to cooperate. But I am
<br>
also a reasonable bush lawyer and former state karate
<br>
champion I don't need to learn that sometimes the 
<br>
opportunity to play nice is taken off the table by others.
<br>
Then, if truth be told I probably find the honesty and 
<br>
directness of a real knock down take no prisoners fight
<br>
preferable to the namby pamby half hearted exchanges 
<br>
of petty spites. I don't *like* the *ambiguity* of the middle
<br>
ground of minor petttiness. I like it to be *clear* whether 
<br>
cooperation or competition is the optimal mode as then
<br>
*I* can commit more fully to either and not waste my
<br>
time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... and the great fear that stops a lesser mind from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming a greater mind is the fear of looking stupid. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh I'd agree with that statement insofar as it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limiting factor for  attempting new directions;
</em><br>
<p>Hell, more than that its a limiting factor in learning. 
<br>
Most of us live lives surrounded by sources of good 
<br>
information and people who will as happily help us
<br>
and return one good turn for another as not. Once
<br>
one builds up some credibility and a stock of skills
<br>
contacts and a knowledge base to trade even the 
<br>
trade gets to be informal and people with win/win
<br>
attitudes to mutual empowerment tend to seek 
<br>
each other out.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The fear of *looking* stupid might very well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cost people their lives in coming decades. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ignorance and stupidity are not the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We all start ignorant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to think we all remain ignorant [given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sheer volume of  information and possibilities]; some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us just manage to migrate to (slightly) lesser degrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ignorance.
</em><br>
<p>I see in this what I consider to be a socrates fallacy, ie, 
<br>
the notion that as nothing can really be known the 
<br>
person who thinks they know nothing is actually wisest.
<br>
<p>As I said, I think its a falacy. We all come into the
<br>
world as sensing agents with a few subjective drives
<br>
that have no meaning in themselves but rather set down
<br>
the boundaries of the types of creatures we can be.
<br>
<p>We are social to an extent, (it is not sensible or useful
<br>
or healthy for us to personally doubt this), we are
<br>
reasonable to an extent ( again let socrates or the 
<br>
neo-socratics take a shot at that as a fallacy). Once
<br>
we know we are social and we are ration we know
<br>
some things that are useful to us, to our happiness
<br>
and our development. We learn that we have freedoms
<br>
but that we remain free within bounds. We cannot
<br>
violate the contingent nature of the universe.
<br>
<p>My point, ignorance is a natural starting postion and
<br>
it is not something to be *ashamed* of, but nor is it 
<br>
in itself a positive virtue. Socrates was wrong. The 
<br>
wisest man is not the man who knows he knows 
<br>
nothing. Imo :-)  A wiser man knows that he is 
<br>
rational and social and that he will find health and
<br>
satisfaction and good relations at least potentially
<br>
with other men (or women) if he proceeds on 
<br>
the basis of these truths that present themselves
<br>
to him on a level even more fundamental than 
<br>
scientific truths. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
