...in a moment of IMHO arrogance.
<br>
<p>There is a definite lack of the sense of purpose and accomplishment in this
<br>
community forum that reflects what is actually going on in the sphere of
<br>
small groups and individuals that make it up. Many of us a) work our asses
<br>
off on extropic goals and b) are not entirely vocal about it (who has the
<br>
time to trumpet these days?).
<br>
<p>Three months of listening to this list wouldn't give you i) the impression
<br>
that much of anything is actually going on, ii) how to help with the things
<br>
that are going on, iii) a fuller sense of the threaded pathways to near-term
<br>
and long term goals.
<br>
<p>I mean, sure, you can run off and read stuff. Having read it, however, you
<br>
don't then have the knowledge to connect that reading to this community.
<br>
There's an enormous chasm for newcomers and even people who've been here a
<br>
while to leap. This, I think, is why you don't see this community driving
<br>
anything.
<br>
<p>In the spirit of getting things done, here is the low-cost organizational
<br>
solution to this particular problem:
<br>
<p>1) Someone becomes Grand Keeper of Extropian Secrets. Democratic process and
<br>
whatnot not really required; duties are not onerous. Should be someone
<br>
responsible and reliable.
<br>
<p>2) The GFES gets a mission statement/miniFAQ/resource list written. Two
<br>
pages should do it. This is posted to the list once a month. I refer to you
<br>
to the CR list at www.calorierestriction.org for a truly excellent example
<br>
of this sort of thing. The purpose of this thing is a) to help the newcomers
<br>
find context, b) to help the oldtimers remember the context.
<br>
<p>3) The GFES finds out what people are doing. I mean *doing*. Like I run
<br>
www.longevitymeme.org. There are at least twenty or so other transhumanist
<br>
webmasters I know of who can be said to be *doing* things. Mike has the Free
<br>
State Project, there are WTA cells all over the place, people organizing
<br>
conferences, two or three nanotech advocacy groups, some of us are even
<br>
figuring out the internals of the human body or building better rockets. I
<br>
mean, there's a lot going on.
<br>
<p>The list of *doing* gets formalized and posted once a month. With contact
<br>
information, brief project descriptions, and How To Help paragraphs. As it
<br>
progresses and shows value, the GFES stops having to prod people, because
<br>
they come to the GFES with their updates.
<br>

Now, speaking as the voice of experience in managing online communities,
this sort of stuff works. Really works. If you want an online community to
get on the same page, get on with things and be constructive, this is the
sort of start you have to make.
