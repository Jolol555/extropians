</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Exactly how do spammers &quot;win&quot; this way? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spammers cripple our freedom to communicate (at least if you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hide your address from the web/usenet and aren't using a good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spam filter) by ruining it for their own selfish purpose. I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty confident that spammers are the bad guys in this case and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that i am not fooling myself in believing deleting all spam is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the good of the tribe. By charging the number of emails sent, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cripple our ability to communicate as well, thus are going the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spammers way. 
</em><br>
<p>This is horse puckey. You do not cripple the ability of anybody to
<br>
communicate but those who send millions of emails, which means
<br>
absolutely NOBODY but spammers. For those on large email lists, it
<br>
might be a LITTLE pricey, but not so much that it does anything more
<br>
but improve the signal to noise ratio.
<br>
<p>For example, if the charge per email is, say, $0.0001, I would pay ten
<br>
cents per post to an email list that has 1000 members. That is less
<br>
than a third of the cost of sending one snail mail letter to ONE person
<br>
(if you only count the postage). It is a minor amount, but enough so
<br>
that a person is going to put some thought into what messages he or she
<br>
sends, rather than just repeating 100 stupid jokes of the day to their
<br>
entire address book all the time.
<br>
<p>Email lists may allow members to opt to accept mail from the list
<br>
&quot;toll-free&quot;. The point is that the abilty to charge per email should be
<br>
in the hands of the email recipients, not the senders. My inbox belongs
<br>
to ME, not you, and I pay good money for that inbox (or else I agree to
<br>
accept advertising in lieu of payment, a la my yahoo account). It takes
<br>
me significant amounts of time to keep the limited space of that
<br>
mailbox free of garbage and unwanted messages, time I could be spending
<br>
on productive enterprises. It therefore costs me money every time YOU
<br>
send me a message. I deserve to decide whether I want to be compensated
<br>
for that waste of my time.
<br>
<p>If you really want me to read something I don't want to read, you are
<br>
going to have to pay me some small amount to do so. If I find your
<br>
posts interesting, I can choose to give you toll free access to my
<br>
inbox. Similarly, a sender should be able to have a setting on their
<br>
message to refuse to deliver to any mailbox demanding payment for
<br>
receipt.
<br>
<p>In the above example, if a spammer is charged $0.0001 per email, it
<br>
would cost him $100 per million messages sent. 100 million messages =
<br>
$10,000. This would quickly shut down all of the illegitimate spammers,
<br>
leaving only those who have a signficant commercial interest and
<br>
ability to pay, who are used to paying for other direct marketing
<br>
methods. These would be companies with concern for their public image
<br>
and are responsive to stockholders and consumers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We already pay a fixed fee for our Internet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection. Most subscription have a user quota (eg, mine is 10GB 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over last 30 days with max. 15% upload), which leaves me virtually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inifinite numbers of mail i may send to communicate with friends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and contacts, for the same monthly fee. Only transfer of large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data amounts may be extra charged, which i understand.  However 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; text communication is bandwidth sparing and should in no way be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcharged. 
</em><br>
<p>The charge is not for bandwidth use, it is for wasting the time of the
<br>
recipient. You DO NOT own their inbox, and have no right to pollute it
<br>
with your mail for free, no matter how important or frivolous the
<br>
reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The more i communicate over email the less costy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each email is, other net services aside. My academic interests 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are duely served by this wonderful technology. If my ISP starts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to charge even one extra eurocent per mail i'll be reluctant and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel less free to send emails to anyone. It would be the end. OTOH
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the other end pay with free passes for your friends is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea either because it could kill new virtual relationship in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bud.
</em><br>
<p>Crap. Any relationship that is not worth a penny is a relationship that
<br>
isn't worth anything to begin with.
