Dan Fabulich wrote yesterday at 7pm or so
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, let's get back to your [Mitchell's] question.  There is no hard-and-fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of &quot;frequentist&quot; in this debate, unfortunately.
</em><br>
<p>The likelihood of that sounds high to me.  :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Using orthodox methods and an expensive statistics program,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calculate the probability that, if the hypothesis &quot;I am looking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; red barrel is correct&quot;, you will see 7 or more red tokens in ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; samples.  Explain why this number is actively harmful to genuine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statistical understanding in twenty-five words or less.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; IMO, the relevant &quot;frequentist&quot; position at which Eliezer was poking fun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here was the position that there are some common-sense events that have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability whatsoever; these &quot;singular&quot; events don't have a probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 0 or 1, they just don't have &quot;probabilities&quot; at all... according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this type of frequentist, the whole notion is simply not applicable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what his point was, but I don't that that it
<br>
is what you have written.  Yes, the only traditional reasons
<br>
separating the Bayesians and the non-Bayesians seems to be,
<br>
as I put it decades ago, &quot;the non-Bayesians are too chicken
<br>
to say what the probability is in some cases&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A good example might be to ask what the odds might be that a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple will get married.  In this case, the frequentist feels obligated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond that &quot;probability&quot; is a misnomer here: probability only applies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when there's a large set of things that can be literally counted.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were a million pairs of nearly identical couples, THEN the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequentist would let it count as a &quot;probability&quot;, but not otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hence, some kind of frequentist might say of Eliezer's question 1, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posed:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1.  After repeatedly revising your probability to take each of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observations into account, what is your estimated chance that the barrel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the one containing mostly blue tokens?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; that the question, as stated, doesn't make any sense: there is no such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing as an estimated probability or prior chance in this case.
</em><br>
<p>I can't imagine *anyone*---&quot;frequentist&quot; or not---who would fail to
<br>
announce a probability for the barrel in question to be the one
<br>
mostly containing blue tokens.  The a priori of 1/2 was clearly
<br>
stated, whereas in your marriage example, of course, it's really
<br>
not so easy to pin anything down, as you explained.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that frequentist WOULD be comfortable answering question 3.
</em><br>
<p>Namely, I think you are saying, that a frequentist would be willing
<br>
to announce a probability that you will see seven or more tokens
<br>
*given* that you are drawing from the barrel containing mostly red
<br>
tokens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, if this frequentist were really hard-core, she might reject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayes' Theorem altogether and try to find the frequency by actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeating the experiment a bunch of times.  That, the frequentist might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insist, would be the only way to guarantee that a meaningful result was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being calculated.
</em><br>
<p>I cannot believe---until someone gives me some evidence---that there
<br>
is anyone who doesn't make free use of Bayes' formula in a case like
<br>
this.  They know damn well what frequency they'll get, because logic
<br>
grabs you by the throat and FORCES you to calculate it.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Looking back at the problem, I have no idea which barrel is red, (since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither barrel was painted,) but, on the presumption that the barrel with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly blue tokens was painted blue, and the other barrel (which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed to notice had an EQUAL number of blue and red tokens) must have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been painted red.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Eliezer did not state the problem using absolutely correct
<br>
terminology, but his meaning was clear enough.  Why are you picking
<br>
on the possibility of a difference between &quot;the red barrel&quot; and &quot;the
<br>
barrel containing mostly red tokens&quot;?  It's clear that this is what
<br>
he meant, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Neither do I find myself able to say much about how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequentist, even my hard-core frequentist, has actively harmed her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical understanding...  even frequentists can plug numbers into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayes as well as anybody else, but sometimes they choose not to on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if I had to give an answer, it would be this: &quot;orthodox statisticians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot explain WHY the given answer is correct; they couldn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicted the answer, and couldn't therefore have been &quot;surprised&quot; by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results.&quot;  [Hence, they have left the path of science.]
</em><br>
<p>Now it seems to me that in simple problems like these that do not
<br>
involve distributions, orthodox statisticians can explain just as
<br>
well as Bayesians why an answer it *correct*.  They merely, (so far
<br>
as I know, and as you pointed out) simply refuse to call certain
<br>
estimates &quot;probability&quot;, and don't appear to have much use for those
<br>
calculations.
<br>
<p>I'm sure that there is more to it than that, but that's how I see it
<br>
right now.
