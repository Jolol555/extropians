<p>
I agree with the analysis given of the article.
<br>
<p>Moore is certainly abrasive and not always accurate.  But he bring a 
<br>
lot of points up that are just ignored by no other major figure.
<br>
<p>I'm very much in favour of capitalism.  However, it's totally unclear 
<br>
to me that what we have here is capitalism -- if companies really 
<br>
worked properly, then when a company lost money, the CEO would at the 
<br>
least lose compensation and at the most be fired.  This just never 
<br>
seems to happen.  It's been shown time and time again that there is 
<br>
no correlation at all between executive salaries and performance of 
<br>
the companies involved.
<br>
<p>The classic example is the music industry.  The accounting for the 
<br>
music business divides the cash outflow into 17 categories, things 
<br>
like promotion, production, artists and repertoire, etc.  Of those 17 
<br>
categories, the largest amount of money goes into executive salaries, 
<br>
the smallest goes into artists royalties (just below &quot;property rental 
<br>
and acquisition&quot;).  This has been true for 20 years and hasn't 
<br>
changed despite the fact the the major labels have experienced severe 
<br>
losses in the last ten years or so.  What's really troubling about 
<br>
this is that it's totally unclear that the executives have any 
<br>
positive effect at all on the quality of the product generated or on 
<br>
the companies ability to sell the music.
<br>
<p>In a true capitalist system, musicians who produced great sales would 
<br>
be rewarded.  This is only true for an extremely small number of 
<br>
musicians, perhaps two dozen in the entire world -- the vast majority 
<br>
sees the fruit of their labor taken away from them by fraud and 
<br>
deception -- see &lt; <a href="http://www.negativland.com/albini.html">http://www.negativland.com/albini.html</a> &gt; for example.
<br>
<p>The issue is that the corporate system completely white-washes 
<br>
accountability.  A corporation is considered legally a person with 
<br>
the same rights as a person but few of the responsibilities. 
<br>
Shareholders are unable to get any sort of accounting, criminal 
<br>
behavior by the officers of the company is in practice unpunishable 
<br>
-- consider the thousands killed and over a hundred thousand 
<br>
seriously injured by the extreme, informed, conscious negligence of 
<br>
management of Union Carbide, not one of whom ever spent a day in jail 
<br>
or paid a dollar in fines!
<br>
<p>Michael Moore points this out.  No one else seems to care.  More power to him.
<br>
