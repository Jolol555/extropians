<p><em>&gt;You know, it's really like in a family. Someone says something, and

<p><em>&gt;I am sure it was common in the ancestral tribe, too.

<p><em>&gt;See how Damien recently reacted to a suggestion by Robert :-)
</em><br>
<p>I'm not anyone's mother. My capital letter bark at Robert when he raised
<br>
nuclear genocide as a possible rational and *morally preferable* option was
<br>
the revolted reaction of a friend who, out of politeness, did not wish to
<br>
say publicly what Eliezer said: `Are you autistic?' 
<br>
<p>This is tricky, because I like Robert, he has been generous in his support
<br>
of me, I've learned a lot from his published papers, and any apt analogy I
<br>
might offer is bound to be offensive. But still, here's the analogy that
<br>
springs to mind: you're all sitting around in the bar, various groups
<br>
conversing or singing at various pitches of intimacy or boisterousness, and
<br>
someone known to the company comes in and starts spraying one wall, using
<br>
liquid excrement, with words such as HOW ABOUT LYNCHING ALL THE ---------?.
<br>
Do freedom-loving folks smile, grimace, shrug, and turn back to their
<br>
drinks? Do they invite him over, still reeking, and begin a reasoned
<br>
discussion about how best to lynch all the -------, some judiciously
<br>
raising the alternative position that perhaps it might be preferable, all
<br>
costs and benefits taken into account, *not* to kill all the -------?
<br>
<p>I agree that Robert was not *advising* anyone to murder 10^8 human beings,
<br>
nor would his advice have any force with those so empowered if he *had*
<br>
urged that course rather than just raising it for consideration. Not the
<br>
point.
<br>

<br>
[only my opinion; I'm just here for the waters]
