<p><em>&gt; There are some very important and worthwhile issues

behind the screens of political correctness and even

intelligent people need to be able to make a mistake
<br>
occasionally if those issues are to be explored and
<br>
solutions illuminated.  
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think a line is crossed when people can't tell the

difference between an abstract discussion and concrete
<br>
actions. I thought Robert was trying to have an
<br>
abstract discussion on an important issue. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------
<br>
<p>Discussing taboo or politically incorrect subjects is
<br>
difficult.  Sometimes it's hard to be dispassionate,
<br>
particularly if someone is perceived (or misperceived)
<br>
as actually advocating something over-the-top
<br>
offensive.  
<br>
<p>If one wants to discuss a topic which is 'difficult',
<br>
then precautions need to be taken to avoid having the
<br>
whole thing blow up in your face.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think taking on a taboo subject is a
<br>
worthwhile challenge.  Exciting even.  The taboo
<br>
subject is by its nature not much explored, so there's
<br>
novelty and low hanging fruit.  And there are
<br>
discoveries to be made about the nature of taboo,
<br>
which I think you will find is more about people than
<br>
about whatever 'other' topic.  It's like bunji
<br>
jumping, or the firewalking thing of a few years back.
<br>
&nbsp;It not mind over matter, or some shamanic magic, but
<br>
rather will over mind, or will over reptilian mind. 
<br>
And when you go there you're in for a steep learning
<br>
curve, and some exhilaration.
<br>
<p>Anyway, a discussion list is exactly the place for
<br>
sensitive topics.  If that's your intent, you might
<br>
warn your fellows to buckle up for a possibly bumpy
<br>
ride.  Or, if you see that you've caught someone by
<br>
surprise, you can take a moment to help them regain
<br>
their composure by reminding them that &quot;No need to get
<br>
upset.  We're just TALKING here.&quot; At the same time, if
<br>
you're a listener who gets surprised by something
<br>
emotionally jarring, well, you can take that deep
<br>
breath all on your own, and remind yourself of the
<br>
difference between discussion, and &quot;sticks and
<br>
stones&quot;.
<br>
<p>Finally, these problems are obviated, as well as the
<br>
possibility that some random visitor might get the
<br>
wrong impression about ExI, if you just have a &quot;place
<br>
out back&quot; for &quot;special&quot; topics.  Then, if you go
<br>
there, you know ahead of time to steel yourself.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<br>
