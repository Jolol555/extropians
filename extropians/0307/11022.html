</em><br>
<p>Yeah but as a consequence this sort of world of 
<br>
discontinuous creatures removes in large part the
<br>
conceptual barrier to uploading (it doesn't touch the
<br>
engineering of the transfer problem but we weren't
<br>
talking about that.) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The terrible part is, since this does not affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their behavior, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no reason for evolution to avoid this outcome.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; continuous, connected consciousness, like us, has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; survival advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over one who suffers the fate of having his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being destroyed.  Therefore there is a substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance that worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where consciousness evolves may indeed be just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; World X. 
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Thank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goodness that we were one of the lucky worlds!
</em><br>
<p>Very droll :-)
<br>
<p>I don't know about the 1/100 of a second bit but we
<br>
(scientists) can and no doubt are builidng up knowledge
<br>
bases of the mechanics of consciousness and neural 
<br>
processing in animal models. We are reducing the 
<br>
mystery and &quot;the leap of faith&quot;.  
<br>
<p>It was good to see Rafal insert a little science into 
<br>
the philosophy naming the regions that are associated
<br>
with particular activities, but I wonder how close any,
<br>
even the most eridite of us are to coming up with 
<br>
a design for uploading our wetware selves to non
<br>
wetware substrates let alone being in a position to
<br>
do it.
<br>
<p>I'd be kind of pleased if a couple or even one extrope 
<br>
could laugh that one off. It can be a pure pleasure
<br>
being wrong when the prognosis was negative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In fact, I just had a horrifying thought... too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrible to share with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others... about our own world.  I shudder to even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imagine it.  But could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it be true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>Of course it could. But isn't it funny how one persons
<br>
best of all possible worlds can be another's worst.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Not only could it be true, but it **is** true(gasp!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Synaptic cycling--fire, pause to reset (horrors!),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ready once again to fire--means we are kilt and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resurrected every fraction of a second exactly as Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypotheticalized(egad!).  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, perhaps not 'exactly'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so, since the synaptic firing may not be globally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synchronized, every neuron marching in step.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed the synapses are firing *at* something.
<br>
Other neurons, which then fire or not depending
<br>
on intensity of that received. But none of this
<br>
marching in step nonsense unless I am seriously
<br>
mistaken. Marking in groups or platoons 
<br>
maybe but not *all* in step. 
<br>
<p>Clearly, to some, I don't know enough about the
<br>
nature of consciousness in our world to be 
<br>
able to tell how far Lee's scenario varies from
<br>
what actually happens. But I do know we can explore
<br>
it and in exploring it we reduce the leaps of faith.
<br>
<p>I did read a book titled CONSCIOUSNESS: 
<br>
HOW MATTER BECOMES IMAGINATION
<br>
(Gerald M Edelman and Giulio Tononi. Pub 2000)
<br>
nd although I wrote all over it I think I only took
<br>
in about 30% of it and have since forgotten a good
<br>
part of that. I would recommend it though. It gets
<br>
a plug o the cover ftom Oliver Sacks, who wrote
<br>
THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR
<br>
A HAT, which I am reading currently but very
<br>
slowly.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Then again, I read not so long ago, that the neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaged in a coherent thought all fire in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synchronized fashion.  I guess that means that, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever extent you're 'incoherent' and ego-less--I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know how to describe this or if it even makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense--like say with intention and active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participation in the thought stream turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off--Oooooohm, oooooohm, oooooohm--then your identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is continuous since synaptic asynchronicity means some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuronal fraction is 'always on'--some firing, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resetting, some resting and ready to fire.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, if you--there's that troublesome little semantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conundrum: which 'you' or aspect set of a temporally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or compositionally dynamic 'you' construct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slippery little devil, are we talking about here--are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 'thought-quieted' receive mode, that you, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought-quieted you, is 'there' with uninterrupted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity (except of course at the vastly shorter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plank time/quantized time 'interval', but never mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that).  Only when 'you' (that problem again) intrude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this continuous asynchronicity by **responding** to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sensory input stream (and I haven't even bothered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider about the automatic/reflexive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'lower-level' processing of the input stream which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'unconsciously'(preconsciously?) filters and shapes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into grist for the mill of higher level thought slash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'consciousness'), and forcing the trade-off of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive/constructive synchronicity, only then do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you 'suffer' the fate of millisecond scale cyclic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity extinguishment/reinitialization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just a thought, ...a thought, ...a thought, ...a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought,...a thought, ...a thought, ...a thought, ...a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought,...a thought,...a thought, ...a thought, ...a
