<p><em>&gt; Sorry Emlyn, but I have to *most* strongly disagree.  Just because a

</em><br>
&lt;example of roughly similar things not quoted&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here are another two definitions of genocide:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. &quot;the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or cultural group&quot; (Merriam-Webster online).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. &quot;the systematic killing of a whole people or nation&quot; [Webster's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New World Dictionary]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, my proposal was not in any way based on race or culture.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it more or less was based on geographical area, i.e., particular 
<br>
countries you seem to belief are so benighted as to be hopeless and possible 
<br>
threats to our continued future and thus to purported HUGE numbers of people 
<br>
to someday be.   Toying with the idea that Afghanistan or N. Korea should be 
<br>
nuked for the alleged good the the supposed future hordes of being does 
<br>
amount to an indiscriminate genocide of a nation or nations. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was based on a clear presentation of the value of current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. future human lives. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually it is based on pure speculation that isn't exactly what I would call 
<br>
&quot;clear&quot; at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that isn't trying to look at things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an extropic perspective then I don't know what is.  
</em><br>
<p>If that is an extropic perspective then I would want nothing to do with 
<br>
extropy!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover a NEO is going to strike the Earth in a month and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probable death toll will be half of humanity then decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to need to be made.  &quot;*Who* do we save?&quot; and &quot;*How* do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we save them?&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>Please stay on track as to what you said and why it is objectionable.  This 
<br>
flak thrown in does not help. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And we aren't going to have all this &quot;flak&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;genocide&quot;.  If anyone on the list thinks that major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military organizations, the Center for Disease Control, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps other security &amp; health related groups have *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought about scenarios (that might kill large numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people) and do not have contingency plans for this then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are simply being naive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant to you proposed thought experiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only thing that I am guilty of might be having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audacity to ask the question of &quot;Do the needs of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many outweigh the needs of the few?&quot; and ask it in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather controversial way.  But it is *not* an unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question (or one that should be discarded from the ExI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list) as the PBS special I cite above shows.  If PBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can debate issues like this, then I think we should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to do so as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Controversial?  Proposing genocide goes far beyond controversial.  
<br>
Indiscriminate slaugther, even as a thought experiment, of entire countries 
<br>
full of people because you or we may be worried about them and not believe at 
<br>
least the leadership is reachable is highly un-extropic.  If such 
<br>
indiscriminate slaughter of sentient beings is not un-extropic then I don't 
<br>
know what is.
