<p><em>&gt; Damien's critic is right; reproducing the Born probabilities is a serious

</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't contradict anything.  In many worlds, you have a straightforward way 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; *different* answer, which is a much more serious problem.  You can deal 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; then split during measurements due to some unknown process.  Or you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state decision theory axioms that declare that we do not care about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counting worlds.  Neither of these is very satisfactory in my opinion.
</em><br>
<p>I think the decision theory approach is relatively promising.  I don't
<br>
know that the axioms really declare that we don't care about counting
<br>
worlds.  In the end, it's true, we conclude that rationally we should
<br>
act as though the standard QM &quot;Born&quot; probabilities hold and ignore
<br>
the simple mechanism of counting worlds.  That is a deduction from the
<br>
axioms and is therefore implicit in them.  But the axioms are intended
<br>
to present a plausible definition of what constitutes rational behavior.
<br>
They don't start right off declaring that we ignore world counts.
<br>
<p>A simpler approach just occured to me.  Let's consider a photon which is
<br>
emitted in a polarized state and encounters a polarizer tilted to give
<br>
a 10% chance of passing.  As Damien describes, if each photon splits
<br>
the world into two, then the fraction of worlds that see the 10/90
<br>
probabilities becomes vanishingly small.
<br>
<p>But does it really split like this?  In focusing on just the absorption
<br>
aspect of the experiment, we are ignoring many other quantum mechanical
<br>
variables.  That's appropriate for experimental purposes, but not,
<br>
perhaps, for philosophy.
<br>
<p>The photon emission itself is a quantum mechanical process.  It was
<br>
emitted by an excited electron dropping to a lower orbital.  This quantum
<br>
transition is more correctly modeled as a continuous process.  The excited
<br>
atom emits a constant, steady-state photon wave, and at some point the
<br>
wave function collapses when we measure the photon as a particle.
<br>
<p>Therefore even a single emission and polarization-measurement of a photon
<br>
does not actually split the universe into two parts; it splits it into
<br>
an infinite number of parts.  Even if it turns out that photon emission
<br>
is not truly continuous, that it can only happen at multiples of the
<br>
Planck time or whatever, that's still a truly enormous number of parts.
<br>
<p>And the point is that among this humongous split, 10% of the universes
<br>
will see the photon pass through the polarizer, and 90% will see it
<br>
be absorbed.  Given this reality, a simple counting rule does in fact
<br>
reproduce the Born probabilities.  It was only because we abstracted away
<br>
the enormous additional complexity of the world in order to focus on the
<br>
polarizer interaction that we thought the universe split into two just
<br>
two branches.
<br>
<p>Now, this is of course just one specific example.  I don't know if it can
<br>
be generalized, or if we could create quantum systems which literally
<br>
have exactly two states, with no additional parameters or dimensions
<br>
that can fatten things up and give us the Born rules.  But at least I
<br>
think this shows that these simple counting arguments are more suspect
<br>
than they seem.
