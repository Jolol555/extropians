I second this motion.

All in favor...

<br>
The Evolution Is Being Broadcast
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ...in a moment of IMHO arrogance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a definite lack of the sense of purpose and accomplishment in
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; community forum that reflects what is actually going on in the sphere of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small groups and individuals that make it up. Many of us a) work our asses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off on extropic goals and b) are not entirely vocal about it (who has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to trumpet these days?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three months of listening to this list wouldn't give you i) the impression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that much of anything is actually going on, ii) how to help with the
</em><br>
things
<br>
<em>&gt; that are going on, iii) a fuller sense of the threaded pathways to
</em><br>
near-term
<br>
<em>&gt; and long term goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, sure, you can run off and read stuff. Having read it, however, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't then have the knowledge to connect that reading to this community.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's an enormous chasm for newcomers and even people who've been here a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while to leap. This, I think, is why you don't see this community driving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the spirit of getting things done, here is the low-cost organizational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution to this particular problem:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Someone becomes Grand Keeper of Extropian Secrets. Democratic process
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; whatnot not really required; duties are not onerous. Should be someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible and reliable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The GFES gets a mission statement/miniFAQ/resource list written. Two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pages should do it. This is posted to the list once a month. I refer to
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; to the CR list at www.calorierestriction.org for a truly excellent example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this sort of thing. The purpose of this thing is a) to help the
</em><br>
newcomers
<br>
<em>&gt; find context, b) to help the oldtimers remember the context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) The GFES finds out what people are doing. I mean *doing*. Like I run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; www.longevitymeme.org. There are at least twenty or so other transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; webmasters I know of who can be said to be *doing* things. Mike has the
</em><br>
Free
<br>
<em>&gt; State Project, there are WTA cells all over the place, people organizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conferences, two or three nanotech advocacy groups, some of us are even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuring out the internals of the human body or building better rockets. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean, there's a lot going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The list of *doing* gets formalized and posted once a month. With contact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, brief project descriptions, and How To Help paragraphs. As it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progresses and shows value, the GFES stops having to prod people, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they come to the GFES with their updates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, speaking as the voice of experience in managing online communities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this sort of stuff works. Really works. If you want an online community to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get on the same page, get on with things and be constructive, this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of start you have to make.
