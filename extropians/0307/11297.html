Interesting Natasha, can you say something more of your media development 
<br>
plan?
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what you're referring to (maybe you are replying to someone 
<br>
else and not me?), but I can't think of a better way to deal with the media 
<br>
than what I have been doing for the past decade :-)  But that is for my own 
<br>
work and not related to ExI.
<br>
<p>For ExI, I think the best plan is to provide reliable information and 
<br>
networking to the world community of futurists and those who want to know 
<br>
about the future.  Also, producing material that helps people develop 
<br>
skills for understanding the development and use of new technologies and 
<br>
the social ramifications provides a service that is tangible.
<br>
<p>Getting media attention is not difficult.  What is difficult is having 
<br>
enough substance that sticks.
<br>
Also, I am more of a grassroots person and think producing 
<br>
transhumanist-friendly mainstream big media is done by many people, not one 
<br>
person or one organization.  Thus, networking futurist organizations is the 
<br>
best development plan and working with cooperation, not competing for 
<br>
center stage which happens all to often in our community.  Center stage is 
<br>
fun, but it's a lot more fun when you share it with people who share smart 
<br>
sportspersonship.
<br>
<p>In summary:
<br>
<p>1.      Form an alliances with other futurist directed that are not 
<br>
necessarily transhumanist in scope;
<br>
<p>2.      Work directly with other organizations for a team-effort and one in 
<br>
which each organization decides what their contribution will be to the goal 
<br>
rather than duplicating the same thing (we see this with Foresight 
<br>
Institute's gatherings which is pretty much the same as the ExI community; 
<br>
and also with WTA's membership and goals which tends to be a duplication of 
<br>
ExI.  If Foresight focused on nanotechnology and encouraged its members to 
<br>
be members of ExI, we would have more money and better advantage.  Further, 
<br>
if WTA had joined forces with ExI rather than try to compete, we would have 
<br>
had a much larger community that would have been more diverse and copacetic 
<br>
to transhumanist goals.
<br>
<p>3.  Send out press releases weekly on publicized issues.
<br>
<p>Just some thoughts that I can think of off-hand.  A more definitive 
<br>
strategy that ExI is working on is not ready for our transparent society. :-)

<em>&gt;###To this end, i already have some media interests that are reaching a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fairly wide audience and have a multi-media network that is launching 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nationally within the next two months.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All of these channels are based on building towards a transhuman friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future. So, this list adn transhumanism in general has at least channel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is only 1 degree of separation from reaching a new, bigger and more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;mainstream&quot; audience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All that needs to happen in order to begin broadcasting transhuman ideas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is for you to submit them. I can get them in print in a newspaper (soon to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be newspapers) and online (soon to be in print) with a magazine. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Additionally there will be other mediums available in the near future.###
