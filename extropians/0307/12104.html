Barbara came up with quite a number of intriguing scenarios:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, this is not really a fair example. What about if you have a knife,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I know for a fact that you've threatened other people with the knife and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stolen their corn?  What if you've just traded in your knife for a machete?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I hear that you're on your way to rob me? Or my neighbor? Should I go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over to your house and blow you away with my shotgun?
</em><br>
<p>I used to hate people who would not submit simple YES or NO
<br>
answers to such questions.  They'd always begin &quot;It depends...&quot;
<br>
<p>It depends on a number of things: firstly, what do I gauge will be
<br>
this person's reaction to the fact that I have a shotgun and
<br>
am inclined to use it on him if he proceeds unjustly with his
<br>
machete?  Let us suppose that this would sober him up, and moreover,
<br>
that he's not the type to sneak up on me and kill me later on.  Then
<br>
moderation seems the best course.
<br>
<p>It would be idiotic IMO to try to place probabilities on all
<br>
these possibilities or tendencies, so one should have to ponder it
<br>
and length, and perhaps talk to others to gain the advantage of their
<br>
thinking and experience before making a decision.  Clearly, I ought
<br>
to go kill him if there is a very large chance he will ambush me
<br>
later.  Moreover, since you bring up his past misdeeds, there looms
<br>
the large possibility that we should jail or execute this person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is still not a fair example. How about this one: what if you have a .22
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caliber handgun, and I have reason to believe you intend to use it to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the community well that supplies all the water for irrigation of crops?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should I go over to your house and blow you away, just in case? Should your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy make a difference?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, your target's &quot;philosophy&quot; definitely should make a difference.
<br>
If you just go over there and show him your shotgun, and muster all
<br>
the true determination and decisiveness you actually possess, and
<br>
attempt to make it clear to him that he can't get his way by threatening
<br>
others with his gun, then you *may* be able to tell from his reaction
<br>
what to do.  I definitely would not go alone however---not for the sake
<br>
of my personal safety, but for the sake of the impact of numbers, and
<br>
to make my decision to take away his gun, or even to kill him, a group
<br>
decision of all of the community that is involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should it make a difference if your reason for taking over the well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to redesign the irrigation system so that it functions more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently?
</em><br>
<p>This definitely depends on how predisposed he is to talk things over.
<br>
If he has decided upon his plan of action because people are dying
<br>
and the council is stupid and stubborn, then perhaps both of you---
<br>
armed---can talk some sense into the council.  But:
<br>
<p>This perfectly well illustrates the paucity of information (necessary
<br>
of course, in most written accounts) in your story.  In a real situation,
<br>
one's knowledge of all the circumstances would be so much greater.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about a less complex situation: Suppose there is a bus carrying 45
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent passengers. You have reason to believe that the bus driver intends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drive the bus through a crowd of pregnant women at a LaLeche League
</em><br>
<em>&gt; event. To allow the bus to continue on its present course may result in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deaths of 50 women, 53 fetuses, and 2 bus passengers; and at least 120
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential lives will be lost (some of the women killed would have gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pregnant and given birth again, after the births of the fetuses they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presently carrying, and several of the bus passengers are females of child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bearing age). Do you  blow up a freeway overpass as the bus approaches,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causing the bus to crash and burn?
</em><br>
<p>You then go on to shade this example with further important particulars.
<br>
In every case you ask &quot;does it make a difference if...&quot;, and the answer
<br>
is always &quot;yes&quot;.  Our decisions would always be based, IMO, on all the
<br>
available data.  Only in rare circumstances would I close my ears and
<br>
announce that I was simply going to adhere to some principle.  On the
<br>
other hand, in no case would I merely ignore the precious principles
<br>
handed down to us by our ancestors.
<br>
