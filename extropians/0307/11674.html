<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I just came across this thought-provoking future speculation by

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Geoffrey Miller, author of &quot;The Mating Mind&quot;: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; <a href="http://psych.unm.edu/faculty/moral_vision.htm">http://psych.unm.edu/faculty/moral_vision.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; There's something broken about this idea, but its hard to say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; exactly what it is...
</em><br>
<p>I can say exactly what it is.  Miller presumes 
<br>
everyone's sense of ethics matches his own.  It 
<br>
would have made more sense if he had postulated 
<br>
that the entire world read The Mating Mind, then 
<br>
fell prostrate at the biologist's feet, begging 
<br>
for guidance in how to invest according to 
<br>
Miller's sense of morality.
<br>
<p>Examples:  
<br>
<p>&quot;...[newly ethical investors suddenly began] demanding that their
<br>
pension funds and mutual funds divest from any producers of armaments,
<br>
alcohol, tobacco, gambling, pornography, or abortifacient drugs.  Within
<br>
a few months, 450 million Catholics controlling about 2 trillion dollars
<br>
in equity had followed his advice.  Lockheed and Penthouse went into
<br>
receivership...&quot;
<br>
<p>So Miller believes abortifacient drugs are worse
<br>
than abortion?  That alcohol, which in at least
<br>
some forms such as wine, has been shown to increase
<br>
lifespan, is immoral?  That communications satellites
<br>
are unethichal?  That investing itself is not a 
<br>
form of gambling?  That established companies depend
<br>
in some way on their stock prices?  Absurdities, all.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;...India and China went straight for subsonic light-rail public
<br>
transport, microgenerator networks, and genetically self-optimizing
<br>
crops...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Again Miller projects his own values onto the
<br>
entire population of the world, presuming that
<br>
public transport is morally superior, even tho 
<br>
it is universally rejected when populations are 
<br>
offered a reasonable alternative.  I think he
<br>
would also find a very large segment of the
<br>
world's population that would object to
<br>
genetically self-optimizing crops, even if
<br>
they had not the foggiest clue what that was.
<br>
Im not sure I know what he meant either.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;...The fad for hiring professors of moral philosophy as CEOs was
<br>
short-lived though: academics obsessed with the internal consistency of
<br>
ethical systems were unsuited to judging the protean moral dilemmas of
<br>
business...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>This was perhaps the most remarkably insightful
<br>
comment in the essay.  I would extend the comment
<br>
to say professors of biology are generally unsuited
<br>
for commentary on ethichal investing.
<br>
<p>As much respect as I have for Dr. Miller's insightful
<br>
book The Mating Mind, I am appalled at the arrogance
<br>
of his presumption that all investors' sense of
<br>
ethics would match his own, or each other for that 
<br>
matter.  Investors already generally steer clear of 
<br>
companies that violate their moral sensibilities.  
<br>
I see no reason to do otherwise, as there are plenty
<br>
of companies to choose from.
<br>
<p>Miller's essay is a form of Hollywood Effect, where 
<br>
movie stars are granted inappropriate credibility because
<br>
of their skill in entertaining, even tho the great
<br>
collective Hollywood Incorporated has demonstrated 
<br>
no unusual insightfulness in political matters.
<br>
Neither should we be surprised when a truly outstanding
<br>
biologist demonstrates that he has no special
<br>
insights into investing or ethics.
