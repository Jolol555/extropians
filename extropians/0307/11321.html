</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As usual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So, does anyone here believe there are authentic journeys of self-discovery 
<br>
and real growth?  If so, what distinquishes such from illusory psuedo-growth?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Real journeys of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;self-discovery would largely be dark affairs, wherein mounting evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;forced people to believe ignoble things about themselves that they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rather not tell others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The classic mystical-tradition term for this is indeed the Dark Night of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Soul. Of course the base things such people uncover might not be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones you have in mind, but they are said to feel really, really rotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about themselves, nigh unto death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Serious self-examination and attempt to grow requires going through a lot of 
<br>
internal sheep-dip.    It is not at all easy and it begins at the point of 
<br>
seeing what is really present vs. what we might wish were present.   Whether 
<br>
what is found is shared with others or not is a different question.   People 
<br>
going through this stuff with honesty and courage usually are not into a lot 
<br>
of pretense with others but also usually don't drag others into the midst of 
<br>
their struggles. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;And those who do struggle over decades to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the truth about what people want, and who are willing to tell others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would face largely indifferent or hostile audiences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As seems to be the case with the gruesome experiences of such mystics. Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course what they have to say when they come out the other side filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bliss (which is probably as self-serving and delusory as normalizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `journey of self-discovery' narratives) also gets a generally hostile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction, except among devotees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, this seems cynical and self-serving in that it would lead to a notion 
<br>
that real self-growth/self-improvment is impossible so why bother.   Someone 
<br>
who has actually grown is indeed a challenge to others who have not done so. 
<br>
<p>I am curious what people here believe about the possibility of real journeys 
<br>
of self-discovery and change and the place of such in extropic living.
