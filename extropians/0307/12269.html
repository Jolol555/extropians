<p><p><em>&gt; How about a poll...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who on the list personally knows someone affected by terrorism. Personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquaintances as maximum distance, no friends of friends please.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More subjective: would you rate yourself now (hopefully based on some kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of quasi-empirical guestimate, at least) as more or less safe than you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10 years ago? 20 years ago? What are the major threats to your continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence/lifestyle? How about 10 years into the future? 
</em><br>
<p>I have lived in the shadow of terrorism for most of my life. People have 
<br>
quickly forgoten the IRA and the death, destruction and fear that they caused. I 
<br>
have been directly effected by terrorism when I worked in London and my wifes 
<br>
office was virtually destroyed by the bishopsgate bomb. Luckily she and her 
<br>
colueges had been evacuated due to the quick response to a warning given by the 
<br>
IRA. Something which the victims of 911 did not have. Also many of my personal 
<br>
friends have been effected by terrorism, not only here but also while on 
<br>
holiday in places such as Spain where ETA operate. Europe in general has always had 
<br>
some sort of constant Terrorist threat, which we have dealt with on a daily 
<br>
basis. Perhaps that is why some Americans might feel that the rest of the world 
<br>
wasn't quite as shocked by 911 as they thought we should be. ??
<br>
<p>My feeling about whether I am safer or not now than I was 10 or 20 years ago 
<br>
is that I am far less safe. one reason is as I stated above, While having 
<br>
always lived with the threat of terrorism. There has always been some comfort in 
<br>
knowing that usually there will be a warning preceeding any activity. This is 
<br>
not the case with the new breed of religously motivated extreamists. There one 
<br>
and only aim seems to be to kill and maim as many people as possible. This 
<br>
coupled with fact that in the case of the IRA, I could understand why they were 
<br>
attacking the UK and in some way agreed with there cause, if not their methods. 
<br>
They could be reasoned with and therfor an end was always in sight, even if 
<br>
somewhat far away. 
<br>
This is no longer true, I cannot agree with, understand or remotely relate to 
<br>
people that kill Men, Women, Children and even their own because of lies and 
<br>
unjustified hatred. These people really scare me.
<br>
<p>So do I feel safer ? Like Fuck do I !!!!!
<br>
<p>The future?  hmmmmmm. I do know one thing, Running around the world shooting 
<br>
at anyone that 'looks at us funny' is only going to end in one thing. A bullet 
<br>
in the back.
