<em>&gt;What is the purpose of self-discovery if not self-alteration?
</em><br>
<p>There is a key difference between wanting to want and wanting to believe 
<br>
that you want.  I hypothesize that people want, and want to want, ignoble 
<br>
things, but that they want others to believe that they want, and want to 
<br>
want, noble things.  Therefore they do not want to believe that they want, 
<br>
and want to want, ignoble things.
<br>
<p>Self-alteration is primarily only at the service of things you want 
<br>
(including things you want to want).  So if people really want to be 
<br>
ignoble, then self-alteration will only make them more so.
