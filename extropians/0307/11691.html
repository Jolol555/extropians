From: &quot;Bryan Moss&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bryan.moss@dsl.pipex.com?Subject=Re:%20How%20Extropians%20Live%20Their%20Lives%20was:%20Optimism">bryan.moss@dsl.pipex.com</a>&gt;

\The
<br>
<em>&gt; numbers we use to predict the Rupture (Singularity) or decide how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;potential lives&quot; are lost by not colonising space or nuking North Korea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for fucks sake) are rough, back of the envelope calculations by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roboticist that make some massive, sweeping assumptions about the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When someone expresses the opinion that, perhaps, the brain isn't easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated, they're usually met with, &quot;I doubt anything quantum mechanical
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; going on,&quot; which forgets that there's no simple correlation between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classical physics and classical computers.  An actual simulation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, its biological and chemical processes, is most likely impractical.
</em><br>
A
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;simulation&quot; of thought processes is pure pseudo-science, as is any claim
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;general intelligence.&quot;  You can argue that not everything that happens
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; the brain (physically speaking) plays a functional role in thought, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's fair (depending on your criteria), but if you start arguing that
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; know what does and does not play functional roles, in any strong sense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're most likely being disingenuous.
</em><br>
<p>### No, I don't think I am being disingenuous when I dismiss Hameroff's
<br>
arguments that the mystery of cognition and intelligence is in the
<br>
quantum-mechanical entanglement of microtubules. We do have a pretty good
<br>
idea about what does and what does not correlate with learning and conscious
<br>
experience. We can safely exclude the chemical basis of life from the
<br>
description of consciousness, as long as the synaptic strengths, the general
<br>
rules for their adjustment and the overall pattern of connectivity are
<br>
accounted for. You can make dramatic changes at the level of ion channels,
<br>
proteins, but as long as they are compensated by appropriate homeostatic
<br>
mechanisms, they do not interfere with synaptic activity and do not impact
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>Therefore, estimates of equivalency of computers and brains based on synapse
<br>
counting are fundamentally right, plus/minus a couple orders of magnitude.
<br>
Since such estimates do not account for the limitations of the architecture
<br>
of brains, such as need for self-organization, unfinished or obsolete
<br>
evolutionary optimization, and the massive redundancy needed to cope with
<br>
the imperfect computational substrate, the actual computational needs for an
<br>
engineered, constructed intelligence implemented in a more stable substrate
<br>
are in my opinion likely to be less than estimated by e.g. Moravec.
<br>
<p>The emergence of superhuman AI is not inevitable, but still quite likely.
