<em>&gt; My guess is that extropy.org, extropy.com, sl4.org, lucifer.com,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; javien.com, and everybody else hosted by Spots InterConnect are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarly being blocked.  You might talk to Spots InterConnect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confirm if all their subscribers are being blocked.  If so, they may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to help resolve this issue at their level by informing AOL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that these addresses are not dynamic.  However, I am not sure AOL will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond, because this bone-headed policy is intentional on their part.
</em><br>
<p>This policy isn't bone-headed.  It's a very reasonable one, actually.
<br>
<p>ISPs have the option to self-elect their IP netblocks as being resold to
<br>
third parties on various lists.  Folks who receive mail then can
<br>
subscribe to those lists and refuse to receive mail from those IPs.
<br>
<p>Why is this good?  Because folks who buy access may not properly secure
<br>
their mail servers.  They may either intentionally or inadvertently set
<br>
up their machines as open mail relays, run an open proxy, or otherwise
<br>
allow unauthorized individuals to use their machines (and thus, their IP
<br>
address) to send mail out.  So, the ISP in good faith elects to add
<br>
the IP addresses they license to customers in these DUL (Dial-Up Users)
<br>
or other lists.  (Yes, &quot;Dial-Up&quot; today is a misnomer, but that's where
<br>
it started and thus got its name.)
<br>
<p>ISPs who do self-elect in this fashion should be offering a mail relay
<br>
server that their customers can use to send mail to the outside world.
<br>
This mail relay should only allow mail to be relayed from IP addresses
<br>
that they own (and have self-elected to add to these DUL lists).  This
<br>
way, there's proper logging of what mail is passing out of the ISPs
<br>
networks by its customers.  This makes identifying violations of their
<br>
TOS or AUP easier, rather than waiting for angry complaints about a
<br>
particular IP address in their netblock and having to figure out who and
<br>
what is doing it.
<br>
<p>David needs to contact Spots InterConnect and ask them what mail server
<br>
he should be using as a relay host.
<br>
<p>My previous ISP, Eclipse Internet (now NetCarrier Communications)
<br>
self-elected their IPs that they use to provide dial-up and DSL
<br>
connections through.  Even the static IPs that I was assigned.  For
<br>
hosts who blocked mail from me via DUL lists, I simply had to add
<br>
entries to my /var/qmail/control/smtproutes file like so:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aol.com:mail.eclipse.net
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aol.net:mail.eclipse.net
<br>
<p>mail.eclipse.net is their mail relay for their customers.  Really easy,
<br>
and it keeps the DUL system working with only a minor inconvenience to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is apparently a common problem for all mailing lists.  AOL not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocks certain type of addresses as above, they also block on keywords
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicating messages that are sexual, extremely political, violent, racist or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subversive.
</em><br>
<p>Do you have proof of this?  Do you have a sample message that will
<br>
trigger this block?
<br>
<p>An individual customer can always report an email they receive as
<br>
offensive, but I don't think they actually block email that a customer
<br>
hasn't flagged as coming from a sender they don't wish to receive mail
<br>
from.
<br>
<p>I think if enough customers report the same sender as sending offensive
<br>
messages, then yes, that sender may be blocked from sending messages to
<br>
any OTHER customers.  I think this is a good service.  One complaint
<br>
might just be a difference in opinion, but if 50 people report being
<br>
harassed from the same sender ... should you really allow that sender to
<br>
send mail to any other people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They also will trigger from subscribers pressing the &quot;report
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spam&quot; button.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is what is really happening in the behavior you mentioned
<br>
above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They also block mail if any intervening ISP is blocked.
</em><br>
<p>Guilt by association.  It sucks, but the many true positives usually
<br>
outweighs any possible false positives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may not even be extropy or javien that is blocked, but some other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customer of that same ISP.
</em><br>
<p>Or, more likely, some customer of Spots InterConnect performed repeated
<br>
abuse and people threatened to blackhole the entire ISP if they didn't
<br>
self-elect their IPs to various block lists, like DUL.  (Guess that
<br>
doesn't sound so much like /self/-election anymore, but it still is.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, the problem is apparently well known and definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside AOL.  Their subscribers may simply need to understand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their mail is being censored.  The Extropians List is still available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them via the web bbs interface, so nobody is completely cut off.
</em><br>
<p>The problem stems from a protocol (SMTP) that hasn't been adequately
<br>
updated to reflect the needs of the Internet, today.  Maybe it was fine
<br>
15 years ago, but it sure isn't workable today.  AOL's simply trying one
<br>
potential hack or workaround to the problems that SMTP isn't addressing.
<br>
It's not perfect, but again, the massive number of true positives it
<br>
blocks definitely outweighs the false positives.  Especially when it's
<br>
trivial to correct things once you realize you're being blocked as a
<br>
false positive.
