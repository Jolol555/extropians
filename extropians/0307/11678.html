<p>OK, I now realize that you were not referring to our official moderators
<br>
(currently Hal and formerly Shaun) when you referenced the &quot;then-current
<br>
list monitor.&quot;  I don't know who you meant by this title, so I retract my
<br>
statement that your history is distorted.  I simply don't know what group or
<br>
incident you are talking about.  I was referencing the level of coordination
<br>
among the attackers and rule violators, but you seem to be referencing the
<br>
level of coordination among the victims and the rule enforcers.
<br>
<p>I readily concede that I complained to a lot of people that the list rules
<br>
were not being enforced.  Reportedly, some of these people did take off-list
<br>
actions on their own that I was not aware of.  I am flattered that you think
<br>
I am primarily responsible for the restoration of order and enforcement of
<br>
the rules to the list.  But I do not claim that these events occurred
<br>
because of me!
