<p><em>&gt; I love any problems that lead to a better understanding of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead-wrong. Scientific rigor makes me aroused.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Im wondering if there is anyone that has or would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to write an accessible update on the trajectories of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics, life extension, nanotechnology, etc. . . Any one of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these topics or all of the above.
</em><br>
<p>Why wouldn't every transhumanist with a computer be doing
<br>
this exercise for themselves?  Start with what you know. 
<br>
<p>Your age. The default prognosis if nothing changes - you will
<br>
die around about when? 
<br>
<p>Then maybe ask what are the technologies and the social
<br>
activities that might change the default prognosis for you.
<br>
<p>There are examples around of people who are making a good
<br>
fist of mapping *parts* of what are likely to impact on the future
<br>
in certain areas. In my view the social and political variables are
<br>
much harder to quantify but that's an aside.
<br>
<p>The cheering section is always larger than the playing section
<br>
but when one thinks that it is ones own life that is at stake and
<br>
that putting ones shoulder to the wheel in some respect is likely
<br>
to increase one's own prognosis, the playing section may 
<br>
increase in size. 
<br>
<p>It is harder to be a generalist and try and track all of the factors
<br>
that are likely to matter but if one starts with a draft one can 
<br>
always improve on it. As one collects facts and finds others
<br>
doing the same thing one can get better at winnowing out 
<br>
the hype from the dross. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The best type of PR is based on facts. I mean, the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someday, some humans will live longer than we currently do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - hell the fact that we live so much longer than our ancestors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - is exciting! It seems to me that the best way to get people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  involved beyond this little circle is to promote the day to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day facts. Tragedy and setbacks are great for this. They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide the drama and tension that's so emotionally charged
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for most people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Evolution Is Being Broadcast
</em><br>
<p>More broadcasters wouldn't hurt though. And as you say
<br>
the best type of PR is based on facts. The surest way for
<br>
one to get the facts is to have a self-empowering strategy
<br>
for finding them for oneself.  As one does it why not slot
<br>
them into a document or some other structure that can be
<br>
peer reviewed.
<br>
<p>Ignorance is no great virtual but we all start there and 
<br>
ignorance is at least partly remediable, if one is honest 
<br>
about it.
