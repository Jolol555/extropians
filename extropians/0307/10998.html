<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I've been finding continuing thinking on the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness quite unsettling. The problem is as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Axiom: I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tenuous hypothesis 1: I have sensory input implying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other stuff, and so it is too.  [Too what, tenuous?]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tenuous hypothesis 2: I am part of the set of other stuff. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You better jolly well believe that you are part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other stuff.  The materialistic hypothesis is everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we could ask for: for four hundred years it has had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an unbroken track record of success, it's simple, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's almost free of contradictions (and they're tiny).
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely, I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (much deduction, investigation, leading to negation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self; self is an illusion, &quot;I&quot; am just a pattern of information)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it depends (of course) on what we ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properly believe the &quot;self&quot; to be.  I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there exists a proper notion of self completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compatible with materialism.
</em><br>
<p>Care to elucidate? I don't think I know what it is. It certainly isn't &quot;the
<br>
will to survive&quot;; that's just a partial specification for a decision making
<br>
algorithm. It's also not an algorithm modelling the universe including
<br>
itself, including the information that the self model represents it; that's
<br>
just data and process again. How can experience arise from that??
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find that if I take Tenuous Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 as axioms, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Result: I am not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It looks probable to me that your notion of self is such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you do not have one.
</em><br>
<p>That's the crux. And yet I do have one, it's the only thing I really know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; By my original axiom, I now have A and ~A. I've just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flushed reality down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the toilet. What is existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The self-awareness of certain machines whose ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to map their environment extends warily into mapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves as a point in their environment?
</em><br>
<p>Why are they aware? What function does it serve? Algorithms and qualia don't
<br>
seem to mix well (if qualia correctly represents what I am trying to
<br>
describe, which I suspect it doesn't).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't fault the materialist viewpoint, because I can't support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alternative; the closer I look, the more it appears that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible role at all for any proposed non-physical piece of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So intelligent thought is a purely physical phenomenon, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processing. Which means that &quot;I&quot; am not; &quot;I&quot; am an illusion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (fooling who?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me (or if you prefer, to this instance of Lee Corbin)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there probably exists a satisfactory meaning to be associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with &quot;I&quot; also.  I am finding that emphasizing the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tegmark's &quot;frog perspective&quot; and &quot;bird perspective&quot; helps clarity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an old dichotomy.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know this example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can only find paradox at the base of any search for an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only phenomenon in the universe that I can definitely call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axiomatic (that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am). To me, it is more clearly evident than the existence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anything else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I totally agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But apparently it cannot be true. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, our course of action is clear!  We need only reform our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notions of &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, and &quot;self&quot; so that the inconsistencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappear.  Now it has appeared to many thoughtful people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this cannot be done without doing excess violence to what those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tokens conventionally mean.  The same fate has befallen &quot;free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. The tokens are not the issue, it is what I am struggling to use them to
<br>
represent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I, and also a number of thoughtful people, think that (unlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;phlogiston&quot; and &quot;soul&quot;) all of the above can be used to usefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate, and that all of the above can refer to objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evident pieces of reality.
