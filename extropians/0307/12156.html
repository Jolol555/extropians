<p>
How can a prescription to trust our moral instincts deal with the fact
<br>
that people disagree about these matters?  In their press conference
<br>
(<a href="http://video.c-span.org:8080/ramgen/ndrive/archive/ter/ter072803_wydendorgan.rm">http://video.c-span.org:8080/ramgen/ndrive/archive/ter/ter072803_wydendorgan.rm</a>)
<br>
the Senators said &quot;betting on terrorism is morally wrong&quot;.  They said
<br>
it was &quot;offensive to almost everyone&quot;, &quot;ridiculous and grotesque&quot;, a
<br>
&quot;sick game&quot;.
<br>
<p>Logic and reason have as some of their main benefits the ability to
<br>
reconcile conflicting views.  If people can agree on their premises, then
<br>
ideally, using logic, they can come to agreement on their conclusions.
<br>
<p>But how can this work with emotions, with instincts?  Suppose I don't
<br>
share the senator's repugnance?  Which of us is right, and which is wrong?
<br>
What mechanism can we use to resolve these differences of opinion?
<br>
<p>I suppose, in practice, we would just say that majority rules.  If most
<br>
people share the moral repugnance of the Senators, then they are right.
<br>
If instead people instinctively thought that the market's potential
<br>
benefits were worthy enough, then the supporters of the futures market
<br>
are right.
<br>
<p>I'm not that happy with a rule like this, that the majority is always
<br>
right.  But what else can we do?
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S. Another well known example of instinctive moral judgements that
<br>
conflict with those held by many of us is Leon Kass's article, The
<br>
Wisdom of Repugnance, about his instinctive discomfort with reproductive
<br>
technology.  How can we know who is right, if it's our guts against his?
