Hey Mike maybe there is something to the power of prayer.
<br>
<p>Buddhists may write their prayers on paper and hang them
<br>
out in the wind but seems the post em to the net strategy
<br>
may work too.

<p>&quot;The European Union will lift its five-year moratorium on
<br>
&nbsp;genetically modified produce to try to defuse a row with
<br>
America, but will impose strict labelling so that supermarket
<br>
shoppers have choice.
<br>
<p>The new rules, to be approved by Euro-MPs today, clear
<br>
the way for bio-crops to be grown and sold in Europe for
<br>
the first time since 1998, but impose tough conditions. The
<br>
bio-tech industry says that this will make the EU fall further
<br>
behind America in a key area.
<br>
<p>All packets of crisps and biscuits and fizzy drink sold in
<br>
supermarkets will have to be labelled a GM product if it
<br>
contains 0.9 per cent GM material, even if it comes from
<br>
derived products and refined oils that no longer contain
<br>
any DNA trace of genetically modified organisms.&quot;
<br>
<p>etc
