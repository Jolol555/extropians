<p>What surprises me is that more people don't question the economic theory and

in fact we are short of all levels of software skill or believed we were a

on more than a personal and humanitarian scale.   We have a

monetary/financial crisis but we act as if it is only a small fluctuation in

demand/need.  It is not.  The need did not change.  The financial resources

connected as some might like to imagine.

<p>I hope not too much of that.  :-)   Really, the one major resource you have 
<br>
right now is time.  Please use it as wisely as you can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do have to say though, as a person who is extremely dedicated
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; *particularly* people resources, are next to impossible to come by

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do remain optimistic, that given enough time on this planet [- sudden
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More than anything else though, its the lack of a skilled [and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedicated]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor supply (read: architects rather than technicians).  Unfortunately,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have yet to actually find a good (reliable) source for such [people]
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You need good technicians in greater abundance than architects.  But the 
<br>
architects are certainly crucial.
