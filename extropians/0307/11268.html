<p><em>&gt; ### Persons who have been wronged may apply force. Their agents may apply

</em><br>
<em>&gt; who produced these human's DNA and contributed nutrition to their fetal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth (and mistakenly assume that having performed these actions entitles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to ownership of the humans in question).
</em><br>
<p>In other words, you would be willing to act on behalf of children (among
<br>
others) who have been wrongfully imprisoned by their parents.  What
<br>
constitutes imprisonment, in your view?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether I would choose to use a private protection agency or a monopolist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provider of security services, the state, is not relevant to the argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also irrelevant what kind of labels you are using to describe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans involved - whether you call some &quot;children&quot;, or &quot;parents&quot; - the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing that matters is who was harmed and how to rectify it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understand.  I think.  As you yourself have said that you are
<br>
willing to act on behalf of children who have been wronged, would you
<br>
mind if I put your name on my web site as a resource for wronged ten
<br>
year olds?  (It is a fact that many parents make incorrect decisions
<br>
regarding the freedoms of their ten year olds.)
<br>
<p>I'm sure that however generous you may be with your own time, you
<br>
would prefer the establishment of a more objective agency, perhaps
<br>
international in scope.  Quite a number of teenagers have been
<br>
denied all the freedoms we customarily enjoy, among them freedom
<br>
of association, free movement, and freedom of speech (the latter
<br>
called, prejudicially, &quot;mouthing off&quot; by their parents).  Do you
<br>
envision a web site where the children can take their complaints,
<br>
and a ruling board that would decide whether intervention against
<br>
the parents will be undertaken?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
