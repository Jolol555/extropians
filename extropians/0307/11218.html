<p><em>&gt; &gt;   1. when should government print money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When it needs more new money, of course.
</em><br>
<p>How perfectly awful of you to say that!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know much about this printing of money business.  I hear it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devalues the currency ... which might be good if your currency is strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and obviously bad if your currency is weak.
</em><br>
<p>Printing more money definitely devalues the currency,
<br>
and, by itself, is quite destructive.  It's an implicit
<br>
cheat against anyone holding the money, and punishes
<br>
especially the prudent.
<br>
<p>But when an economy really is expanding---due to the
<br>
very miracle I like to discuss---then the printers
<br>
whip up some more money and lend it to the banks, who
<br>
lend it to their customers.  (And in times of contraction,
<br>
this same money vanishes in the exact reverse process.)
<br>
<p>In the scenario I'm thinking of (very simplified), the
<br>
government (or whoever else is printing money) observes
<br>
that
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) factories are closed and people are out of work
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) people who have money and would like to buy things
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are afraid to do so because of (i)
<br>
<p>So the government prints $2,000,000,000 and hands it out, the
<br>
factories open because they know for sure because now at least
<br>
half the populace will rush back into the stores, and then
<br>
finally the people who have money and were merely afraid
<br>
to spend it will see that everything is getting better.
<br>
<p>At the very end of the process, the government takes the
<br>
$2,000,000,000 out of the subsequent tax revenue, and burns it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;   2. when should it reduce taxes *in order to* stimulate growth&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Define where you're measuring &quot;growth&quot; -- that's important.  Raising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes stimulates growth in the government agencies while reducing taxes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulates growth in the private sector.  I presume you're only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in the private sector, so ... I think any time you reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes, you are stimulating growth in the private sector.
</em><br>
<p>Good question; by &quot;growth&quot; I mean that which takes us towards
<br>
the singularity. Whatever advances the economy in the long run.
<br>
Growth is, of course, difficult to measure, but the economists
<br>
use GDP and other measures, even though they realize that they
<br>
contain flaws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and distributing it out to government organizations, a tax cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; effectively cuts out the government as the middle-man and sends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that money directly back out into the economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A nice generalization, but not always true. What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; times that government projects, usually infrastructure, end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up creating wealth in the long run?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like which?
</em><br>
<p>It may be that the American space program is an example,
<br>
and it's likely that the &quot;American Road&quot; they built 
<br>
across the Appalachians in the early 1800's is another.
<br>
I don't know if the English government were involved
<br>
(one must say &quot;they&quot;, one knows), but it might have
<br>
turned out to be very sensible to have got behind
<br>
all the canal building over there in the late 1700s.
