<p><em>&gt; When I was a teen, I used to tell my friends that the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; evinced surprise, I proudly announced that it really was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two degrees to the west of where it looked like it was,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or about four sun-diameters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I explained that this was (of course) because the light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took eight minutes to reach us, and so the sun's real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position was two degrees to the right (looking from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Northern hemisphere).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of them spotted the flaw in my logic :-)  and it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take a few on this list a moment or two to see where I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going wrong.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good puzzle; it fooled me for a few minutes.  If the sun were
<br>
actually &quot;rising&quot; and &quot;setting&quot;, travelling around the earth every 24
<br>
hours and drawn by Apollo's chariot, then what you say would be right,
<br>
its apparent position would lag its actual position.  But since the sun is
<br>
stationary, and the earth is rotating and moving slowly enough to mostly
<br>
neglect aberration, then when the earth turns so that you are closest
<br>
to the sun, the sun really is directly over your head at that instant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyway, it seems that Laplace *did* correctly determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that where the sun is as measured by a sensitive gravimeter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not the same place that it looks like it is.  There is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very nice exercise in &quot;Problem Book in Relativity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gravitation&quot;, Lightman, Press, Price, and Teukolsky:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The position of the sun in the sky can in principle be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measured by a sensitive tidal gravimeter.  What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angular difference between this position and its position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as measured optically?  If the actual position of the sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were at its optical position, there would be a force in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the direction of the Earth's motion.  If this were the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find the radius of the Earth's orbit as a function of time.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting that in this passage it seems to go without saying
<br>
that the position measured by the gravimeter is in fact the &quot;actual&quot;
<br>
position of the sun.  That is certainly non-obvious and in fact it is
<br>
something that can stand considerable discussion, as this and related
<br>
threads have shown.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The answer has something to do with the aberration of light,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I understand it.  If the Earth is going 66,000 miles per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hour (30 km/sec) past the sun, then the sun appears slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shifted towards the forward direction.  That makes sense.
</em><br>
<p>Often an analogy is used to vertically-falling raindrops, where if you
<br>
are moving forward the raindrops appear to fall slanted, from in front
<br>
of you, in your frame of reference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what I infer from this problem is that *gravitationally*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it isn't so!  The gravity waves don't lie!  There must not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be anything like &quot;aberration of gravitons&quot;.  (This thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is also what lent me credence in my earlier post that perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the frame of reference of the space-bending (i.e. gravitating)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object is the correct frame of reference to use.  Mostly?
</em><br>
<p>It's not that gravitons are immune to aberration.  Presumably if you could
<br>
emit and detect a graviton beam, they would be subject to aberration
<br>
just like any other particles.  (Let's not forget that gravitons are
<br>
very hypothetical at this point.)
<br>
<p>Rather, the action of gravitons as mediators of gravitational force is
<br>
quite different from simple emission and absorption.  Instead, gravitons
<br>
are to gravititational force as photons are to electrical force.
<br>
<p>If you bring two oppositely charged particles together, they attract.
<br>
In quantum theory, this is expressed by the action of &quot;virtual&quot; photons
<br>
whose shadowy existence produces indirect effects that lead to the
<br>
measured force.  These virtual photons don't have well-defined paths
<br>
and can even travel at speeds other than c.  In some ways it is better
<br>
to think of them as mathematical terms in a series expansion than as
<br>
real particles.
<br>
<p>This is why electric fields, like gravitational ones, are not subject to
<br>
aberration.  If the sun were charged and you could measure its position
<br>
with a sensitive electrometer, it would show up at the same spot as
<br>
shown by the gravitational meter.
<br>
<p>In principle, gravitons would play the same role for gravity as
<br>
photons play for electromagnetism, but in practice the theories are
<br>
not so similar.  Attempts to come up with a consistent quantum field
<br>
theory for gravity have failed; the tricks that worked for the photons
<br>
fail for gravitons.  As I have heard it, the problem is that gravitons,
<br>
having mass and energy, exert gravity; while photons, being uncharged,
<br>
do not generate electromagnetic fields.  This extra complication with
<br>
the gravitons produces infinities in the theory that have not been
<br>
successfully eliminated.
<br>
<p>If you want to know more about virtual particles, a good next step is
<br>
the discussion in the sci.physics FAQ,
