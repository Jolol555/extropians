<p>Apparently they have the same problems (lots of mosquito

repellents for dogs, and they do spread diseases to them:

<a href="http://memorias.ioc.fiocruz.br/932/3390.html">http://memorias.ioc.fiocruz.br/932/3390.html</a>). Mosquitos seem to

thrive on most large mammals and birds:

<br>
Here in Sweden they likely live mostly on elks, cattle and humans. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This observation causes me to wonder what happened

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I noted the benefits of being relatively furry when encountering 
<br>
the northern gnats - they got lost in the fur on my arms. Very 
<br>
neat. 
<br>
<p>The aquatic ape theory says it was because of water, but that 
<br>
never stopped the otters. My guess is that long distance running 
<br>
made it too hot - we developed more sweating instead. This article 
<br>
suggests it is sexual selection + demonstrating lack of parasites: 
<br>
<a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,972905,00.html">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,972905,00.html</a>
<br>
This theory also suggests it was due to our development of 
<br>
shelters, fire and clothing the evolutionary pressure removed the 
<br>
fur.
<br>
<p>Of course the *real* reason is the spread of Gruad genes, but the 
<br>
Illuminati doesn't want you to think that. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I favor the notion however that humans could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually eliminate mosquitos from the planet, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should we determine to do water control correctly.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps this attitude comes from having grown up in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Florida, where the old-timers would absolutely marvel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at how successful the state's mosquito control efforts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been.  They have not been eradicated, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute number of mosquitos has dropped to perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% what they were in the 1920s.  I may be wrong but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my perception is that the problem has dropped in half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since my own childhood in the 60s.  Water control is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the key to bug control.  spike
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But managing the ecosystem without them is somewhat tricky. 
<br>
All those flying pests also provide significant amount of food for
<br>
various neat birds. While some mosquito species aren't keystone 
<br>
and just spread disease and annoyance, others are hard to remove 
<br>
without having to remodel plenty of other species. 
<br>
<p>I wouldn't mind becoming invisible to all insects, that would
<br>
probably be the best solution: no risk from overly curious wasps,
<br>
hungry mosquitos, generally annoying flies and their relatives and
<br>
ants when observing them.  Hmm, is there a way to confuse compound
<br>
eyes? Maybe one could set up destructive interference through some
<br>
patterns (Zebras?  flickering light?).
