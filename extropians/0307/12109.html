</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because of regulations put in place to protect him the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unskilled worker in the US may not get the *choice* to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell their services at price parity with those in third world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sweat shops. In some labour intensive forms of manufacture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (perhaps producing Nike shoes) the total cost of production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is substantially determined by the cost of the unskilled labour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force.I think car plants and other forms of manufacturing facilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also examples of where the cost of production is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially determined by the cost of the unskilled labour force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A multinational can establish its plant wherever it gets the cheapest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost of production. Capital can move across national borders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily but the US unskilled worker will not find it easy (even if he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to) to avoid the oncosts of occupational health and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety regulatons. The US worker is not free, in the free market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to just up and relocate to the third world country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nor I suspect would you or I want him to have to reduce his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost at the price of his health and safety. 
</em><br>
<p>In the original form of the US government, its revinues were almost
<br>
entirely based on either tariffs, imposts, and excises, i.e. trade,
<br>
since the primary function of the federal government at the time was
<br>
naval protection of trading ships and maintaining the 'channels of
<br>
commerce', i.e. the navigable waterways, which were the highway system
<br>
in the early US. It only stood to reason that those benefitting most
<br>
from such federal expenditures should pay the cost.
<br>
<p>This was also why the rural Pennsylvanians, West Virginians, and others
<br>
rose up in rebellion against the whiskey excise tax, since the feds
<br>
made no investments in building channels of commerce across the
<br>
appalachians by which farmers could easily transport their crops to
<br>
markets in coastal cities. The feds invested in no Road Guard to patrol
<br>
roadways like the Coast Guard patrolled the rivers and lakes and
<br>
coastlines.
<br>
<p>Another duty of the federal government is the 'general welfare' of the
<br>
economy, i.e. its economic vitality and long term stability (i.e. NOT
<br>
nanny statism). If high paying skilled manufacturing jobs are being
<br>
shipped overseas or replaced by automation, leaving just poorly paid
<br>
burger flipping jobs in their place, this is a constitutional concern
<br>
of the federal government because it deals in not just the long term
<br>
economic stability of the nation, but its political stability as well.
<br>
<p>Even worse, a government that allows the export of not just its high
<br>
paying manufacturing jobs overseas, but its higher paying knowledge
<br>
jobs overseas is asking for only one possible result: the reinstitution
<br>
of feudalism, because all that will be left are wealthy stockholders
<br>
and lots and lots of burger flippers and blue jeans sales people, and
<br>
garbage collectors, etc etc etc. i.e. an aristocracy of educated elites
<br>
and a majority of uneducated and unskilled wage slaves.
<br>
<p>This is not what libertarianism is about.
