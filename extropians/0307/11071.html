<em>&gt; The reflected photon would have the same 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; only if the light source and the reflector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are stationary with respect to each other.
</em><br>
<p>Is this actually the case?  Has it been 
<br>
observed experimentally with stationary 
<br>
versus moving mirrors?  Certainly we've 
<br>
heard of radiation that has been Doppler-shifted 
<br>
red or blue from radiation sources moving
<br>
towards or away--respectively--from the 
<br>
observer.  Is a moving reflector equivalent to a
<br>
moving emitter?  What are the differences between
<br>
these two radiation-'manifesting' processes?  And what
<br>
are the differences between the reflection(1) we
<br>
associate with mirrors (metallic and dielectric), and
<br>
the reflection(2) we associate with, say, the moon,
<br>
which seems more rightly a case of absorption and
<br>
re-emission?    
<br>
<p>More fun.  
<br>
<p>Consider the solar sail when first unfurled.  If it
<br>
were in a conventional stable orbit, with no radial
<br>
velocity relative to the sun, would there then be no
<br>
force arising from 'radiation pressure'?  
<br>
<p>That doesn't seems reasonable.  I've just finished
<br>
reading a few web pages on radiation pressure.  It
<br>
seems a fairly established phenomenon, with both
<br>
heavyweight theoretical
<br>
foundation--Maxwell--<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pressure</a>
<br>
and experimental confirmation.  
<br>
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichols_radiometer">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichols_radiometer</a>
<br>
A Nichols radiometer is the apparatus used by Nichols
<br>
and Hull in 1901 for the measurement of radiation
<br>
pressure. 
<br>
And nowhere is motion of the illuminated area
<br>
mentioned as a factor.
<br>
<p>So, will an observer traveling with the solar sail
<br>
observe an alteration in frequency of the incoming and
<br>
outgoing radiation?  Does starlight from a receding or
<br>
approaching star change frequency when reflected in an
<br>
earthbound mirror?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If the reflector is moving away from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light source, there is clearly gravitational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential energy coming from somewhere.
</em><br>
<p>Yesiree.  Everything suggests a pressure, a force over
<br>
an area, a transfer of and increase in momentum, and a
<br>
consequent inescapable increase in energy, some
<br>
combination of potential:out of the gravity well, and
<br>
kenetic--increase in velocity.  The question remains,
<br>
where's the energy coming from?
<br>
<p>It seems logical to look to the incident radiation for
<br>
the source of the energy.  I would be looking for less
<br>
energy coming 'out' in the reflected radiation, than
<br>
went in, originally.  And I would expect the degree to
<br>
which the reflection is 'perfect', as with a
<br>
finely-polished mirror, to correlate with low
<br>
absorption/heat generation, and high ratio conversion
<br>
to velocity parallel to the radiation. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The reflected photons are red shifted by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receding reflecting surface.  Photon's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; momentum  is transferred to the sail, no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy is lost, no conundrum or paradox, no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically illegal procedures.
</em><br>

<br>
Also, from the original article, we have this quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;There may also be evidence to support Gold's theory,
<br>
in the form of a quirky device called a Crookes
<br>
radiometer. It consists of four paddles attached to
<br>
the arms of a rotor, inside a vacuum jar. Each paddle
<br>
is silvered on one side and coated with a black
<br>
absorber on the other. When placed in sunlight, the
<br>
rotor spins. If the theory of solar sailing is right,
<br>
the rotor should spin with the reflecting silver
<br>
surfaces moving away from the light. But it actually
<br>
spins the other way...&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, I've seen one of these gadgets, and the little
<br>
vanes do indeed turn away from the blackened side and
<br>
in the direction of the silvered side.  Clearly the
<br>
'radiation pressure' on the silvered side, with a high
<br>
degree of reflection, is no match for the competing
<br>
force generated, presumably, from the absorption,
<br>
heating, and reemission from the blackened side.
<br>
<p>Hmmmm.  
<br>
<p>Would a better solar sail result if the inward-facing
<br>
side were blackened and the outward side silvered?
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
