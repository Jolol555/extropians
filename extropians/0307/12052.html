_Our Molecular Future: How nanotechnology, robotics, genetics, and artificial
<br>
intelligence will transform our world_ by Douglas Mulhall
<br>
<p>Prometheus Books, 2002, HB, 392PP, Bib, Ind, Illus, $28.00, ISBN 1 57392 9921
<br>
<p><p>Futurology can be a funny business.  Like science fiction with an MBA, tomes
<br>
such as *Our Molecular Future* inevitably tell you more about the concerns
<br>
of the present than the path of the future.  They can often be at their
<br>
most fascinating 10 or 50 years down the line, when you can marvel at how
<br>
much they got right or, more usually, chortle at how wrong they were in
<br>
their extremes of optimism or pessimism.  And in many cases, there's a
<br>
certain strain of quasi-religious revelation about the whole exercise.
<br>
<p>Douglas Mulhall, a journalist and sustainable development consultant, sets
<br>
out to be speculative rather than predictive, and dedicates the book to
<br>
anyone &quot;who walks the perilous path between those who claim that technology
<br>
will solve our problems, and those who say it will destroy us&quot; -- a suitably
<br>
fortean ideal.  Disappointingly, his own writing sometimes fails to live up
<br>
to that standard.
<br>
<p>*Our Molecular Future* is centred on the potential of molecular
<br>
nanotechnology -- the manipulation of matter at the molecular level, as
<br>
popularised in the late 1970s by Eric Drexler.  The first half of the book
<br>
is a fairly straightforward prognostication of the potential benefits or
<br>
problems of the technological vanguard.  According to Mulhall, nanotech
<br>
promises to revolutionise society and economy, deliver virtually free
<br>
energy and the flying car, and save humankind from terrorism, earthquake,
<br>
disease and asteroid impact.
<br>
<p>Interlinked areas of robotics, artificial intelligence, virtual reality
<br>
and genetic manipulation also come into play.  The book opens with the
<br>
concept of 'singularity' -- the point at which humans are effectively
<br>
rendered obsolete by advancing machine intelligence, unless we decide
<br>
to upgrade ourselves of course.  It closes 300 pages later with the
<br>
assurance that nanotechnology can enable us to &quot;transcend our dark side
<br>
and enter a new era&quot;.
<br>
<p>Although Mulhall displays some scepticism towards the more outré claims
<br>
of the Extropian movement and suchlike techno-utopians, there's an
<br>
inescapable note of visionary evangelism in his own writings.
<br>
Interestingly, he tells of how he was struck by a sudden realisation of
<br>
the fragility of Earth civilisation while observing the Shoemaker-Levy
<br>
comet crash into Jupiter in 1994, a moment of illuminating epiphany.
<br>
<p>The central section of the book details the many natural catastrophes
<br>
that could cripple or destroy civilisation, and includes a detour into
<br>
historical catastrophism and the fate of Atlantis, complete with an
<br>
appearance by the ubiquitous Graham Hancock.  New technologies, of
<br>
course, can deliver us from such fates.  This juxtaposition of ideas
<br>
did, however, make me ponder that perhaps Atlantis developed into a
<br>
truly nanotech civilisation, and the reason its ruins have gone as yet
<br>
undiscovered is because they're really, really wee.
<br>
<p>Mulhall has deliberately set out to write the 21st century equivalent of
<br>
Alvin Toffler's *Future Shock.*  Various sections of his wilder speculation
<br>
are likely to alienate technologist and environmentalist alike, and his
<br>
rather excitable rhetoric doesn't always help: molecular nanotechnology is
<br>
like &quot;a magma dome rumbling beneath the surface of society, ready to blast
<br>
out from countless vents, burn away every obsolete technology, and establish
<br>
a new substrate on which to build&quot;, apparently.
<br>
<p>The other problem with books such as this is that they very rapidly become
<br>
outdated.  In the early chapters, Mulhall provides a rapid introduction to
<br>
cutting-edge nanotech research, including the groundbreaking research at
<br>
Bell Labs in the U.S.  Since the book's publication, much of this research
<br>
has been discredited following the discovery of fraud involving star
<br>
researcher Hendrik Schön.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, this is an informed and provocative manifesto for a
<br>
technological century.  And forteans should be pleased to learn that the
<br>
world could get a whole lot weirder and, Mulhall promises, more personally
<br>
satisfying.
<br>
<p>Tim Chapman
<br>
<p>Fortean Times verdict:  6
<br>
<p>...over-egged provocative manifesto for the 21st century...
