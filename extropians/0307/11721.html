<p>I haven't read MoI yet, but it sounds as though I should, even if it's
<br>
not mainly a life-extension book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another point made in the book is that there are a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of gerontologists and respected scientists like Steve Austad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Leonard Hayflick (and around 49 others) who seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt that immortality will ever be achieved. 
</em><br>
<p>Please post this quote.  There was a &quot;position statement&quot; orchestrated
<br>
by Hayflick and two others and endorsed by 48 more, whose main message
<br>
was that *existing* so-called anti-aging medicine is a misnomer (which
<br>
is why I was one of the 48), but which also (because of the bias of the
<br>
organising trio) touched on longer-term prospects.  But Austad refused
<br>
to sign on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a better approach to attacking the anti-aging, problem has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested by Aubrey de Grey and this better (in my view approach)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has not been addressed by Hayflick or Austad.
</em><br>
<p>Correct, but deserving of a comment.  Hayflick is simply very out of
<br>
date on such issues and indeed has no real clue what I'm proposing in
<br>
the necessary degree of detail, despite having taken part in my second
<br>
roundtable (see my site <a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/</a> and the links
<br>
on the left).  Austad on the other hand is among the most optimistic
<br>
of the senior cadre of biogerontologists in his public statements: he
<br>
is the one who said that the first 150-year-old is probably already
<br>
alive, and in fact he is now on record that the first 160-year-old is
<br>
probably already 60.  He isn't really as up-to-speed on the details
<br>
of what I propose, but he's definitely at my end of the spectrum of
<br>
professional biogerontologists, so if MoI implies otherwise he's been
<br>
misrepresented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd really love to see Aubrey discuss the ideas in his paper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medicine ( <a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/manu16.pdf">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/manu16.pdf</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the likes of Hayflick and perhaps especially Steve Austad.
</em><br>
<p>This may happen soon (with someone on Hayflick's side but much better
<br>
informed and more influential).  Watch this space.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The conventional approaches to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-aging are NOT going to lead to immortality or even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious extension of life-spans soon, but Aubrey's approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more daring. Alas it is probably also a harder sell. 
</em><br>
<p>Unclear.  I always maintain that the only constituency I really need
<br>
to get on my side, publicly, is a respectable number of my colleagues
<br>
in biogerontology.  I'm progressing quite well in that regard -- the
<br>
conference coming up in Cambridge (<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/iabg10/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/iabg10/</a>)
<br>
is another big step in that regard.  Once people like Austad start
<br>
promoting my way of thinking on the TV, the war will be over.  That
<br>
may be sooner than you think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there is a comment in the back of MoI where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hall quotes Ali Brivanilou of the Rockefeller &quot;the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between mouse embryological development at the molecular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level and human development was &quot;night and day&quot;. &quot;Everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we know about the mouse, (embryologically), we already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know is not true for humans&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>This is (a) hyperbole, (b) embryology, and most important (c) it is
<br>
science rather than intuition.  It doesn't matter a hoot how hard it
<br>
will actually be to translate late-onset mouse life extension therapy
<br>
to humans: what matters is that the general public will intuitively
<br>
feel that it may be hard but there's a fighting chance that it'll be
<br>
possible within a decade or two.  That public intuition will force
<br>
public investment in pushing the effort to translate the technology
<br>
to humans as fast as it can go.  How fast that is doesn't matter,
<br>
just as the war on cancer is getting just as much money now as in
<br>
the 70s despite having, shall we say, rather overrun its schedule.
