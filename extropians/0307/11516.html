<p>Not for the reasons that you state, Mike.

<p><em>&gt;  I don't follow your reasoning here Mike. Why

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Nah, almost negligible.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Not so. Look at the impact record, especially on the far side
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of the moon. If the moon were not so significant, you'd see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;little variation between the near side and far side impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;records. Instead, the far side looks like it's suffered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;multiple cases of chicken pox, cow pox, small pox, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;leprosy.
</em><br>
<p>You must consider the time dimension.
<br>
<p>After the moon formed (in a molten state- one theory called the
<br>
large-impact hypothesis describes why this is so), it was subjected
<br>
to intense bombardment. This was during the first 1/2 billion years
<br>
of its life. The Moon's crust was shattered, and you can see large
<br>
basins like the Mare Imbrium basin formed during this time. Then
<br>
between 4.1 and 3.9 billion years ago, the cratering rate fell
<br>
sharply, to about 1000 times less than its early heavy bombardment
<br>
rate.
<br>
<p>While the Moon cooled rapidly after its formation, some process
<br>
heated the subsurface material and part of it melted, which produced
<br>
lava. The deep basins were flooded by successive lava flows between
<br>
3.8 and 3.2 billion years ago.
<br>
<p>The key to understanding why the maria are nearly free of craters
<br>
and the highlands heavily cratered is the time of events and the
<br>
thickness of the Moon's crust and topography of its surface. The
<br>
cratering was intense and early. Then the lava flows filled in those
<br>
early records and created the maria, but not uniformly over the
<br>
surface of the Moon.
<br>
<p>Studies have shown that the Moon's crust is thinner on the side
<br>
towards the Earth. Gravity mapping, shows that on average, the lunar
<br>
crust is about 70 km thick, but it varies from a few tens of
<br>
kilometers beneath the mare basins to over 100 km in some highland
<br>
areas. Under some of the largest basins, the crust was weakened so
<br>
much that the mantle has bulged upward. Moreover, the intrusion of
<br>
the dense mantle material into the crust changes the local gravity
<br>
field.
<br>
<p>In addition to the gravity mapping, Clementine's laser altimeter
<br>
showed for the first time a relief map of the Moon's topography. The
<br>
global map of the Moon's topography showed that the near side of the
<br>
moon appears relatively smooth with typical relief of only 5 to 6km,
<br>
whereas on the far side one sees a full 16-km range of relief. The
<br>
difference is caused by wide-spread filling of the near side
<br>
basins by mare basalts and a relative scarcity of maria on the far
<br>
side. Moreover, the wide range of relief on the far side is caused
<br>
mostly by the presence of the enormous South Pole-Aitken basin, 12km
<br>
deep.
<br>
<p>The Moon's center of mass is offset from its geometric center by
<br>
about 2 km in the direction of the Earth, probably because the crust
<br>
is generally thicker on the far side. Spudis says in (2) that it
<br>
might explain why so few maria exist on the far side of the Moon.
<br>
Imagine a subsurface boundary akin to a global water table,
<br>
attracted towards the center of mass with equal gravitation force at
<br>
every point. Because of the 2-km offset, this equipotential surface
<br>
lies farther from the top of the crust on the far side. It is
<br>
possible, therefore, that basalt magmas rising from the interior
<br>
reached the surface easily on the near side, but encountered
<br>
difficulty on the far side.
<br>
<p>Instead of deflecting Near Earth Objects gravitationally, as you
<br>
hypothesize, the Moon's effect on the Earth is something different.
<br>
Spudis points out that without the Moon's stabilizing effect on the
<br>
Earth's rotational axis, life on Earth would experience extreme
<br>
climate changes and also wouldn't have evolution-catalyzing tides in
<br>
the oceans.

<p>&quot;...Geologic evidence for low-latitude glaciation during the
<br>
Precambrian era suggests that the obliquity of early-Earth may have
<br>
been much higher than it is today. Earth's obliquity could have been
<br>
reduced to its present value as a consequence of
<br>
obliquity-oblateness feedback. In this process, obliquity-driven
<br>
changes to continental ice volume and oblateness may have caused a
<br>
secular downward drift in obliquity of ~30o between 600 Ma and 500
<br>
Ma. Such an event may account for the present non-zero inclination
<br>
of the lunar orbit.&quot;
