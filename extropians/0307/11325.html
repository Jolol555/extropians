<em>&gt;Deutsch also links to an organization, Taking Children Seriously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/</a>, dedicated to the principle that &quot;it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible and desirable to bring up children entirely without doing things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to them against their will, or making them do things against their will,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that they are entitled to the same rights, respect and control over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their lives as adults.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I found this site quite interesting. I was surprised at the degree to
<br>
which they are able to use a Popperian approach to conclude that popular
<br>
dogmas about children are cruel.
<br>
&nbsp;I generally agree that children should be treated as rational beings,
<br>
and that disagreements between adults and children should cause us to
<br>
suspect a disagreement in goals rather than that the children are being
<br>
foolish and need to have the adults' opinions forced on them.
<br>
&nbsp;The &quot;Gateway Religions&quot; essay at
<br>
<a href="http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Articles/KSGatewayReligions.html">http://www.eeng.dcu.ie/~tcs/Articles/KSGatewayReligions.html</a>
<br>
is particularly amusing: &quot;Look for the following DANGER SIGNS that
<br>
may indicate your child has been using religion&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;But I'm unconvinced by the TCS claims about what obligations parents
<br>
have towards their children, as illustrated by this attitude towards
<br>
carnivorous children:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vegetarian who believes that meat eating ought to be legal ought
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to buy it for their child and give them the respect they would give
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another human being.
<br>
I didn't see any argument that this view is better than the more standard
<br>
view that the parental payment for the food gives them substantial
<br>
authority to influence what their children eat, just as it would if they
<br>
were feeding adult friends. Did anyone see an argument that I missed?
