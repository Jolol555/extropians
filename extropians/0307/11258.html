</em><br>
<em>&gt;If someone has the cognitive representation that they want to be nicer,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am objecting to your phraseology here because it seems to preemptively 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I do agree that this is a subtle question, whose answer is not immediately 
<br>
obvious.  The topic of self-deception can be a conceptual morass, as our 
<br>
usual anchors are not as available.   Nevertheless, I do want to argue for 
<br>
the claim you find questionable.
<br>
<p>If people have contradictory beliefs, how can we say which ones are the 
<br>
&quot;real&quot; beliefs?  By reference to the basic schema of self-deception, in 
<br>
which the real beliefs tend to determine less visible actions with more 
<br>
fundamental consequences, and the false beliefs tend to determine what we 
<br>
tell others and ourselves about ourselves, and the most socially visible 
<br>
actions with the least fundamental consequences.
<br>
<p>If you smoked often in private, but told yourself and others that you did 
<br>
not smoke, and did not smoke in public, I'd say you really wanted to smoke 
<br>
but didn't want others to believe that you smoked.  If a corporation 
<br>
polluted a lot, but had a public relations department that insisted that it 
<br>
did not pollute, and that PR department managed to make sure that no 
<br>
pollution was obvious during public tours of corporate facilities, I'd say 
<br>
the corporation wanted to pollute but did not want to be thought of as 
<br>
polluting.
<br>
<p>If we make the hidden smoker's actions visible enough, he might stop 
<br>
smoking.  And if we give enough publicity to the corporation's polluting, 
<br>
it might stop polluting.  But is this because the smoker did not want to 
<br>
smoke, and the corporation did not want to pollute?  I'd say it was because 
<br>
they wanted more not to be believed to smoke, and to pollute.
