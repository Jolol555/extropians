<em>&gt; You have a good point. I would not say that cryonics is lower in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausibility now than in earlier years, rather that we have now a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the difficulties involved, so that realistic estimates of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when cryonics patients may be revived have to be set later in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.
</em><br>
<p>Your entire posting sounds like this.  You seem to agree with my basic
<br>
point, but you wouldn't say it in such negative terms.  The examples you
<br>
discuss, cryonics, cancer, etc. are the same.  We had predicted success much
<br>
earlier.  We now know the problem is much harder than we thought.
<br>
Technology is racing ahead much faster, but we are pushing specific
<br>
milestones back farther and farther with our newer knowledge.
<br>
<p>In short, I don't think anybody is really disagreeing with me.  They just
<br>
don't want to use negative terminology.  They refuse to call these
<br>
occurrences delays, setbacks, or failed predictions.  They explain away how
<br>
it was government technology, poor information, mistaken assumptions, or
<br>
whatever.  But my point remains.  Predictions have been pushed back before.
<br>
Current predictions may need to be pushed back.
<br>
<p>We can't jump on every hyped theory and then assume exponential growth from
<br>
there.  Sometimes there are delays, setbacks, and failures.  Sometimes we
<br>
have to find a different approach when one path doesn't pan out.  This is
<br>
normal scientific method and experimentation.  However, many people here
<br>
don't seem to understand this.  There seems to be a mistaken belief that we
<br>
only move forward, that things go faster and faster without delays, and that
<br>
all scientific breakthroughs pan out and move into production.  That's not
<br>
how it works.  Those are the faith-based promises of hype and PR, not of
<br>
real scientists.
<br>
<p>My original point was merely explaining my frustration that there are some
<br>
setbacks occasionally.  This has since evolved into a further frustration
<br>
that many people seem to believe that there are never setbacks and I am only
<br>
imagining problems where none exist.  Sometimes there are problems, folks.
<br>
Pretending that they don't exist won't help us.
