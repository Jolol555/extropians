<p>Ok, you've got a point there about reduced volcanic activity in the future, 
<br>
and some quick research reveals that I was probably wrong about the lack of 
<br>
Snowballing in &quot;recent&quot; history.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;Could the Earth become a &quot;snowball&quot; in future? For the last million years, 
<br>
the Earth has been in its coldest state since the Neoproterozoic. We are 
<br>
now living in a relatively warm episode, some 80,000 years from the next 
<br>
glacial maximum, but some evidence suggests that each successive glaciation 
<br>
over the last several cycles has been getting stronger and stronger.&quot;
<br>
<p>Still, it seems absurdly anthropomorphic to claim that we are rushing in to 
<br>
save the Earth just in time.  When the solar system (and galaxy and...) 
<br>
blooms we'll be able to claim credit, but even if every human alive were 
<br>
killed off instantly, I bet another species could evolve to intelligence 
<br>
before the big ice comes.
