Giu1i0 Pri5c0 a écrit (25.7.2003/15:59) :
<br>
<em>&gt; My experience tells me that good lawyers are quite smart folks able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand quickly whatever they need to understand in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defend their client in court. So I think any good lawyer will &quot;get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it&quot; is (s)he wants (read: if paid enough). If I were to choose a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer to protect my own frozen body against this kind of things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than choosing a naive &quot;believer&quot; I would choose one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal sharks who win divorce and inheritance cases (like Pat Webster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in The First Immortal).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The difficulty is that, contrary to divorce and inheritance cases,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here there is no money to win. So the lawyer wants to be paid in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cash instead that as a percent of the sum gained.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest that you contact the very best legal studio in Paris and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find out how much they want to take the case. If it is much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the Martinot family can afford (I am sure it is), we can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much we can raise from cryonicists.
</em><br>
<p>Somehow I agree with your idea, but with some reservation. Cryonics is
<br>
so young and fringe at that stage, that you may actually need someone
<br>
who understands the scientific and philosophical background to
<br>
defend it usefully.
<br>
<p>The Martinots' situation, legally speaking, is crystal-clear: they are
<br>
dead, and will be disposed of according to the law. It would seem you
<br>
cannot &quot;use the law&quot; to defend the Martinot in France, right now,
<br>
however smart and sharky you are. You need to get the guys to consider
<br>
that the couple might not really be dead, so that dead bodies disposal
<br>
law is not relevant. And that is difficult, because cryonics is seen,
<br>
at best, as a scary movie fantasy.
<br>
<p>Another thing is, French lawyers are not as sharky as in the US, for
<br>
reasons linked to the special status of lawyers, and for more general,
<br>
societal reasons. Money-driven social organization is, FBAW, not as
<br>
pervasive in Europe as it is in the US.
<br>
<p>In any case, I am presently finding out what the next judiciary stage
<br>
involves, and what the options are.
<br>
<p>Jacques
