Giu1i0 Pri5c0 a écrit (24.7.2003/17:39) :
<br>
<em>&gt; In Europe, we care much less about God. I am very happy that in the EU
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitution under elaboration the word &quot;God&quot; is absent, despite pressures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the Vatican, and I hope it will stay out in the final version. So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether something is or is not against &quot;God's will&quot; is much less of an issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over here. Unfortunately (for what concerns cryonics) Europeans are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensitive than Americans to social issues. So we will see objections like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;cryonicists buy potential immortality while the majority cannot afford it&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>Yes. With the following, which is a variant:
<br>
<p>&quot;If cryonics actually makes sense, then everyone will want it, and it
<br>
will cost too much to the community. We better spend this money on
<br>
living people during their normal life.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, it's a &quot;family-like&quot; reasoning. &quot;We better spend...&quot;
<br>
<p>The idea that cryonics may make sense, but that people will still have
<br>
to pay for it individually, is relatively alien, as all differentiated
<br>
access to medicine has been abolished in France (which is great in
<br>
some way; any bum can benefit from the best technology and the best
<br>
specialist, free; to say the truth I am amazed that such a system can
<br>
actually work; and it sort of does).
<br>
<p>So people instantly visualize &quot;cryonics for all&quot;, and see freezers
<br>
everywhere, and think it's crazy.
<br>
<p>[snip other possible objections]
<br>
<em>&gt; Now: what can we do to help winning the Martinot case?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know.
<br>
<p>In any case, if you want to write to Rémy Martinot and his lawyer, do
<br>
it. Don't know French? I'll translate your letters.
<br>
<p>Write the letter, write me with your letter, and I will send you back
<br>
the postal adresses and your letter translated. To make things easier
<br>
for me, please keep it relatively short (2 pages max.), and include
<br>
your letter in an email message (no attachment). Same if you want to
<br>
write someone else on this subject.
<br>
<p>I've written this afternoon to a few French and European
<br>
libertarian-oriented organizations; it's probably what comes closest
<br>
to associations defending individual liberties. There are many
<br>
European ones, that speak English. You may want to contact them to try
<br>
persuading them they should lobby for this.
<br>
<p>You can start at <a href="http://www.cne.org/">http://www.cne.org/</a> and go to the links section for
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>I finish by referencing the decision of the Conseil d'Etat on the
<br>
somewhat similar case last year, which I just found on the web. It was
<br>
negative. It's obviously an important starting point for filing the
<br>
Martinot appeal to the Conseil d'Etat.
<br>
<p>Conseil d'Etat, 5 / 7 SSR, 2002-07-29, 222180, Publié au Recueil Lebon
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/Visu?cid=157070&amp;indice=2&amp;table=JADE&amp;ligneDeb=1">http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/Visu?cid=157070&amp;indice=2&amp;table=JADE&amp;ligneDeb=1</a>pÄ	<br>
<p>The single most important step, in my opinion, would be for a French
<br>
lawyer who &quot;gets it&quot; to contact Rémy's Lawyer, Alain Fouquet from
<br>
Angers (ask for contact info). If you know a non-French lawyer who
<br>
&quot;gets it&quot;, maybe HE knows a French lawyer who gets it. (Maybe Greg
<br>
Burch?) FInd out.
<br>
<p>Jacques
