<p><em>&gt; Point taken.  I might offer that perhaps there are 3 codes --

</em><br>
<p>I agree, if what you're saying is that humans are genetically predisposed to
<br>
perceive, think, and act in certain ways. This &quot;instinctual&quot; way of
<br>
perceiving, thinking, and acting may or may not serve us well in any given
<br>
situation. For example, some of the research I've read indicates that people
<br>
are not genetically predisposed to approach decision making in a rational
<br>
manner. (I've read a lot of research on decision making, because my PhD
<br>
dissertation [not completed] was on the topic of how people make business
<br>
decisions). In an emergency where complex decision making is required, even
<br>
a mathematical genius might (would probably?) tend to fall back on
<br>
irrational decision making techniques.This is one reason people need a set
<br>
of behavior-guiding rules that have been carefully thought through before an
<br>
emergency arises.
<br>
<p>As you point out, we will soon be in a position to alter the instinctual
<br>
code, but from what I've read and from interviews I've heard and
<br>
conversations with people working in the field, it will apparently be quite
<br>
difficult to precisely control such complex behavior as decision making (the
<br>
behavior may well be *altered* in various individuals, but I suspect such
<br>
alterations will at first be random byproducts of genetic alterations made
<br>
for completely different purposes).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code seems highly society dependent (witness &quot;eye for an eye&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors in Iraq or Turkey which have been the discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of recent news articles).
</em><br>
<p>Sure. First, successful rules (successful = encouraging the survival of the
<br>
culture) will be different depending on the environment, so you'd expect
<br>
that some rules which made a lot of sense in one time and place, with a
<br>
certain population size and so forth, wouldn't work well in other
<br>
situations. Second, there is almost always more than one way to satisfy any
<br>
given need. Third, the rules for any given culture are to some extent
<br>
dependent on each other.
<br>
<p>The &quot;eye for an eye&quot; rule might work quite well in a situation where people
<br>
live in relatively small, self-governing tribal groups. I would not expect
<br>
it to work well with large groups of people ruled by a small elite group.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The legal code seems quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bendable [at least over time] (witness the recent PBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specials documenting how the wives of Henry VIII were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated using varieties of court/church/political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;law&quot; all the way up to the the Japanese internment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during WWII -- &quot;The Fred Korematsu Story&quot; and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Supreme Court was manipulated by the Justice Dept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce a verdict that still seems to hang over our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads).
</em><br>
<p>I didn't see the PBS specials (wish I had; sounds interesting), but I'm well
<br>
aware of the bendability of the legal code.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Against those 3 codes -- I would still offer up the questions of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- (a) Are the rules of the code(s) worth the sacrifice of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    who would uphold it (or believe in it) [or benefit from it]?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, then the question would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to become &quot;How many current lives -- and how many future lives --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    are you willing to sacrifice for such principle(s)?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>With all due respect, Robert (and I do mean this -- I respect you, or I
<br>
would not be spending my time engaged in this discussion), I think you're
<br>
asking the wrong questions and that a better set of questions would be
<br>
something like this:
<br>
<p>1. For any given legal code, is there a coherently expressed moral code upon
<br>
which it's based?
<br>
2. If there is such a moral code, is it valid for the circumstances under
<br>
which the legal code will be administered?
<br>
3. If the answer to 2 is &quot;no&quot; then what changes are needed to bring the
<br>
moral code into line with present-day reality?
<br>
<p>Sometimes your approach seems to be all or nothing. Either the moral/legal
<br>
code functions perfectly or it's completely worthless. But other things
<br>
you've written lead me to believe that this is not really what you mean to
<br>
say (for example, your comment that to act on the premise &quot;the hell with the
<br>
moral code&quot; would lead to chaos and would thus be entropic rather than
<br>
extropic). Incidentally, there was some research done around 25 years ago to
<br>
find out what motivates taxpayers to be honest on their tax returns (sorry,
<br>
I don't have a copy of the paper, and I can't even recall the authors'
<br>
names). Among the motivators tested were fear of getting caught and
<br>
subjected to fines and imprisonment, fear of being publicly exposed, and the
<br>
perception of a moral duty. Perception of a moral duty to pay one's taxes
<br>
was a significantly more powerful motivator than any of the others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that I'm attempting to force one into a position of doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triage (what lives do I allow to be lost now?) as well as performing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a discount value analysis of the net worth of current vs. future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human lives.
</em><br>
<p>Triage is generally associated with emergency situations. More broadly, it
<br>
can mean &quot;the assigning of priority order to projects on the basis of where
<br>
funds and resources can be best used or are most needed&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=triage">http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=triage</a>c<br>
<p>Although assigning priorities is certainly necessary when one is deciding
<br>
between conflicting goals, I don't see the concept of triage as particularly
<br>
useful in evaluating and revising a moral code. Rather, it's a process you
<br>
would use after the moral code is already in place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Rather than saying that it's okay to disregard one's moral code, you now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem to be arguing that a practical moral code should be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the assumption that the needs of many outweigh the needs of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few, or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps I am more interested in precisely *when* one code grants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precedence or priority to another.  Or I may be interested in how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one structures the codes for the most extropic outcome.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably reasonable to assume that I desire the most extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.  This would seem in line with my actions over the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade, my position on the ExI board, and at least some of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postings to the list).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if an extropic future path is in conflict with current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal, moral or instinctual codes then I think we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously look at those codes.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the last paragraph above. Note that the legal code is
<br>
relatively easy to change, the moral code a bit more difficult, and the
<br>
instinctual *very* difficult. Although the instinctual code can be
<br>
overridden by the moral code in day-to-day life, people often fall back on
<br>
it in a bind, so the best moral code is one that meshes well with the
<br>
instinctual code, and a major instinct is to Stay Alive. One thing I never
<br>
liked about Christianity (at least as it was presented at the churches my
<br>
parents forced me to attend when I was a kid) was that if one practiced it
<br>
conscientiously and consistently, one would soon be dead.
<br>
<p>Now, just to make sure we're all on the same sheet of music here, I believe
<br>
the main topic under discussion is whether or not it would be appropriate to
<br>
nuke North Korea tomorrow, or some other time before they've actually taken
<br>
any action beyond developing weapons; or more generally speaking, whether or
<br>
not it would be advisable to kill a group of people whose continued
<br>
existence might shorten the lives and/or prevent the births of a larger
<br>
group of people.
<br>
<p>You have offered two lines of thought: on the one hand, you said that all
<br>
people are pretty much alike and therefore one should look only at numbers:
<br>
thus, it would be permissible to kill, say, 100 people, in order to allow
<br>
105 people to live. Or perhaps you would argue that the difference in
<br>
numbers must be a certain minimum %, say 200%. Thus, it would not be okay to
<br>
kill 100 people in order to let 105 people live, but it would be okay to
<br>
kill 100 people to let 200 people live.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, you have argued that the reason the north Koreans should
<br>
be killed is that they have an unextropic culture. You added that because of
<br>
the nature of the culture, their continued existence could result in the
<br>
deaths of, and failure to be born of, a much greater number of people. So
<br>
maybe you would insist that this is still selection by the numbers, but I
<br>
don't think it's quite the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Apparently in your scenario, the decision maker is whoever has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the most potent weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would appear to be true.  However the decision maker can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose *not* to exercise that power.  In which case the power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; migrates to those with less potent weapons.
</em><br>
<p>While this is true in certain circumstances, I don't think it is necessarily
<br>
true. Clearly it's not true with respect to interactions between
<br>
individuals. If I have a shotgun, which I could use to threaten you and
<br>
steal the $15 you have in your wallet, but instead I give you my surplus
<br>
corn for your $15, my power hasn't migrated to you. We're now both better
<br>
off. I've freed up the storage space the surplus corn was taking up, you've
<br>
got the corn, and I've got the $15. And I haven't used up any of my shotgun
<br>
shells.
<br>
<p>However, this is not really a fair example. What about if you have a knife,
<br>
and I know for a fact that you've threatened other people with the knife and
<br>
stolen their corn?  What if you've just traded in your knife for a machete?
<br>
And I hear that you're on your way to rob me? Or my neighbor? Should I go
<br>
over to your house and blow you away with my shotgun?
<br>
<p>This is still not a fair example. How about this one: what if you have a .22
<br>
caliber handgun, and I have reason to believe you intend to use it to take
<br>
over the community well that supplies all the water for irrigation of crops?
<br>
Should I go over to your house and blow you away, just in case? Should your
<br>
philosophy make a difference? Should it make a difference if your reason for
<br>
taking over the well is to redesign the irrigation system so that it
<br>
functions more efficiently? (note: I do not mean to imply that North Korea
<br>
is technologically superior to the U.S. The preceding is a purely
<br>
hypothetical line of thought)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me reformulate it -- one can sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 million (10^8) human lives (one time) *or* one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifice 10,000+ potential humanities (i.e. ~10 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people) *every second* that you choose not to sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those 100 million lives.
</em><br>
<p>How about a less complex situation: Suppose there is a bus carrying 45
<br>
innocent passengers. You have reason to believe that the bus driver intends
<br>
to drive the bus through a crowd of pregnant women at a LaLeche League
<br>
event. To allow the bus to continue on its present course may result in the
<br>
deaths of 50 women, 53 fetuses, and 2 bus passengers; and at least 120
<br>
potential lives will be lost (some of the women killed would have gotten
<br>
pregnant and given birth again, after the births of the fetuses they are
<br>
presently carrying, and several of the bus passengers are females of child
<br>
bearing age). Do you  blow up a freeway overpass as the bus approaches,
<br>
causing the bus to crash and burn?
<br>
<p>Does it make a difference if one of the passengers on the bus is the brains
<br>
behind a research project that is on the brink of a major medical
<br>
breakthrough that could potentially save millions of human lives over the
<br>
coming centuries?
<br>
<p>Does it make a difference if the pregnant women are taking part in an
<br>
anti-abortion demonstration and if 30% of them are carrying Downs Syndrome
<br>
fetuses?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I have not seen one discounted present value analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the lives lost [because we wish to maintain current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal or moral codes]  (and this leaves out what the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those lives from an extropic perspective which may be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different).
</em><br>
<p>If you wish to value people purely for the amount of money their lives could
<br>
have generated, the value of a human life will vary, depending on the
<br>
individual whose life you are valuing. A mentally &quot;challenged&quot; person, who
<br>
could hope to contribute no more than his physical labor over the course of
<br>
his life, or a bright person burdened with an inability to focus, would be
<br>
worth a lot less than someone capable of focused, thoughtful action. In
<br>
general, males would be worth less than females (for an interesting analysis
<br>
of the costs and benefits of the two sexes, see MEN ARE NOT COST EFFECTIVE
<br>
by June Stephenson). Following your argument that most people are pretty
<br>
much alike, the most cost effective way to proceed might be to kill all the
<br>
males whose IQ's are less than 140 (and even quite a few of the smart ones
<br>
might need to be sacrificed, since many high IQ males don't seem to be very
<br>
productive) while allowing all women with IQ's over, say 100, to live.
<br>
<p>Aside from difficulty of determining the value of a life before the fact,
<br>
this does not seem to be a very satisfactory measure of the value of human
<br>
life even after the life has been lived and you can add up all the money the
<br>
individual generated. Not all valuable traits can be traded in the market,
<br>
and therefore there *is* no monetary value. It's true that monetary
<br>
valuation for, say, companionship, is attempted in personal injury and
<br>
wrongful death lawsuits; but no one claims that this is anything more than a
<br>
means of settling a dispute.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Your suggestion of mass murder to save humanity is qualitatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; similar to spiking your drinking water with arsenic to kill bacteria.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, my thoughts were motivated to save *many* humanities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, I do not understand the comparison -- I am proposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some may need to die so that many many more others may live.
</em><br>
<p>You are proposing an extremely messy, expensive course of action. Among
<br>
other things, you have neglected the cost of environmental damage,
<br>
disruption of trade, breakdown of relationships with other nations, probable
<br>
breakdown of civil order within the U.S. In order to justify this
<br>
destructive course of action, you are proposing the adoption of a moral code
<br>
that would neglect the value of the individual, thus leaving no basis for
<br>
individual freedom. There's a book that discusses the economic value of
<br>
individual freedom: *Human Action: A Treatise on Economics* by Ludwig von
<br>
Mises

<br>
?v=glance  I would recommend it, at least as a starting point in devising an
<br>
extropic moral code.
