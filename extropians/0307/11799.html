From: &quot;Mark Walker&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I just came across this thought-provoking future speculation by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Geoffrey Miller, author of &quot;The Mating Mind&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://psych.unm.edu/faculty/moral_vision.htm">http://psych.unm.edu/faculty/moral_vision.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There's something broken about this idea, but its hard to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exactly what it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. I find implausible how the system is supposed to get rolling in the
</em><br>
first
<br>
<em>&gt; place--the signaling system seems too weak. Of course, a strong signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system is introduced later on with the &quot;moral vision system&quot;, however, it
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; difficult to see how this system could realistically get going without
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt; a strong system earlier on. The trouble of course is how to signal that
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; has made an ethical investment. It is true that sometimes some entities
</em><br>
get
<br>
<em>&gt; called on the carpet, e.g., a teachers' pension fund might get criticized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for investing in something less than ethical, the trouble is how to assess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see the signals of those whose financial dealings are not open to public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scrutiny. It is the usual problem with defectors: one can wear a pin and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look like one is investing with the ethical while in fact actually
</em><br>
investing
<br>
<em>&gt; with the merely &quot;prudent&quot; (Of course the prudent may invest the way that
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; ethical do on occasion, the prudent have the &quot;advantage&quot; that they need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not). For example, notice how the story talks says that  &quot;the major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Protestant churches in the U.S. instructed their congregations to bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their investments into line with their consciences.&quot; Well, if it were that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy you would think they could stop any number of sins, e.g., it would
</em><br>
seem
<br>
<em>&gt; a simple matter to stop adultery by simply exhorting everyone not to covet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thy neighbor's wife, etc. The story of course could be altered to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accommodate this point. Perhaps the ethical wave doesn't get rolling until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the advent of &quot;moral vision system&quot;. Another less hi-tech possibility is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the amount one invests in ethical funds allows one to earn one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angelic titles in the traditional hierarchy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   a.. Seraphim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   b.. Cherubim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   c.. Thrones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   d.. Dominions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   e.. Powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   f.. Authorities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   g.. Principalities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   h.. Archangels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   i.. Angels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the greater your investment (as a proportion of your disposable income)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into ethical funds the higher your angelic title. If I'm as invested as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be in ethical funds then I might earn the title &quot;Seraphim Mark
</em><br>
Walker&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt; What's to stop everyone calling themselves a 'Seraphim', well, my income
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; investments could be monitored by an independent agency and the results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; published on the web. There would be no need to publish my earnings or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holdings, only the percentage of my disposable income invested in ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds, (which would be expressed by my angelic designation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I've had a couple of further thoughts on how to engineer the social good.
<br>
When we compare modern society to our tribal past it seems clear that we now
<br>
have a harder time signaling and tracking how individuals contribute to the
<br>
social good. The angelic rating system suggested above for ethical investing
<br>
could be expanded to include the number of hours that one volunteers per
<br>
week, the amount one gives to charity and the percentage that one invests in
<br>
ethical funds compared to investment in nonethical funds. For example if one
<br>
gave to charities at the average rate U. S. 3.2 % of income before taxes
<br>
(<a href="http://www.justgive.org/html/don_info/howmuch.html">http://www.justgive.org/html/don_info/howmuch.html</a> ), and volunteered 2
<br>
hours a week (<a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0764352.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0764352.html</a>), and invested an
<br>
average amount in ethical funds then one would merit the average angelic
<br>
designation 'powers'. (The donation rate might be rated on a sliding scale
<br>
depending on one's income). Those that donate more than an average amount of
<br>
their time and money (over their lifetime) will move up the angelic scale.
<br>
The angelic scale, as mentioned above, would be maintained by a volunteer
<br>
organization. One would have to submit evidence of their monetary and
<br>
volunteering good deeds. So how would the angelic designation be put to use?
<br>
For instance, other things being equal one might prefer to hire the
<br>
candidate with a higher angelic rating, or deal with a company with a higher
<br>
angelic rating (its rating being calculated as the average of its
<br>
employees). One might brag that they dump the ex because he or she was a
<br>
mere archangel, while their new boyfriend or girlfriend was a Seraphim. In
<br>
short, if the system were adopted by enough people it would allow one to
<br>
track altruistic (or at least behavior intended to promote the good) and
<br>
reward or punish as one sees fit. If the system changed peoples behavior to
<br>
increase the average level of altruism in theory the tax rate might go down
<br>
as more &quot;good deeds&quot; are taken on by the private charities.
<br>
<p>One of the ethical issues that this might raise is whether it would be
<br>
permissible to discriminate on the basis of an angelic rating. Would it be
<br>
ok  to hire on the basis of the candidate's angelic rating? Would it be ok
<br>
for universities to set admission criteria in terms of an angelic rating?
<br>
I'm inclined to think that this shouldn't be a problem.
<br>
