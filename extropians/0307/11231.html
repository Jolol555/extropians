</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gaussian priors. So, I still don't get the philosophical lesson.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Bayesian v. frequentist&quot; philosophical arguments are plagued with
<br>
vagueness; one feels the vagueness more acutely than in many other
<br>
philosophical arguments b/c they both seem to brush up right next to
<br>
what's analytically verifiable, and because the math can be so niggling
<br>
and error-prone.
<br>
<p>(I note, for example, that you happened to misread the problem Eliezer
<br>
posed; you solved a perfectly fine problem instead, but not exactly the
<br>
problem as posed.  That problem has some handy features that which allow
<br>
you to simplify and solve the problem just a bit faster.  [Though I sure
<br>
as hell wouldn't notice them unless I was working on paper.])
<br>
<p>[There's something else driving this &quot;argument&quot; as well, IMO.  There's a
<br>
deep psychological problem with the study of statistics: it's so easy to
<br>
make trivial errors with huge ramifications that, once you get kind of
<br>
good at it, you realize just how absurdly often people make radical
<br>
mistakes in their statistical intuitions; people who do this a lot usually
<br>
leave the path of interpretative charity, assuming that their opponents
<br>
are probably just making a mistake like everyone else, not that they are
<br>
well-informed thinking people with reasonable and possibly serious
<br>
objections.]
<br>
<p>But, let's get back to your question.  There is no hard-and-fast
<br>
definition of &quot;frequentist&quot; in this debate, unfortunately.  I wish I could
<br>
say that Goertzel was &quot;wrong&quot; in his characterization of frequentists, but
<br>
I'm afraid I just can't guarantee that.  One thing I can say, though, is
<br>
that he almost certainly wasn't really talking about the definition of
<br>
frequentist/orthodox that Eliezer was using in his bonus question 3:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.  Using orthodox methods and an expensive statistics program,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculate the probability that, if the hypothesis &quot;I am looking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red barrel is correct&quot;, you will see 7 or more red tokens in ten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samples.  Explain why this number is actively harmful to genuine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical understanding in twenty-five words or less.
</em><br>
<p>IMO, the relevant &quot;frequentist&quot; position at which Eliezer was poking fun
<br>
here was the position that there are some common-sense events that have no
<br>
probability whatsoever; these &quot;singular&quot; events don't have a probability
<br>
of 0 or 1, they just don't have &quot;probabilities&quot; at all... according to
<br>
this type of frequentist, the whole notion is simply not applicable
<br>
sometimes.
<br>
<p>A good example might be to ask what the odds might be that a certain
<br>
couple will get married.  In this case, the frequentist feels obligated to
<br>
respond that &quot;probability&quot; is a misnomer here: probability only applies
<br>
when there's a large set of things that can be literally counted.  If
<br>
there were a million pairs of nearly identical couples, THEN the
<br>
frequentist would let it count as a &quot;probability&quot;, but not otherwise.
<br>
<p>Hence, some kind of frequentist might say of Eliezer's question 1, as
<br>
posed:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1.  After repeatedly revising your probability to take each of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations into account, what is your estimated chance that the barrel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the one containing mostly blue tokens?
</em><br>
<p>that the question, as stated, doesn't make any sense: there is no such
<br>
thing as an estimated probability or prior chance in this case.  Hence,
<br>
nothing to calculate, and nowhere to begin.  (It's hard to say what
<br>
exactly a &quot;real&quot; self-described frequentist might say in response to
<br>
Eliezer's example, because it's easy to see how the experiment is, at
<br>
least, repeatable in principle, as opposed to, say, the married couple
<br>
example, which really just can't be repeated with any kind of scientific
<br>
rigor as far as we know: lovers attitudes towards each other are
<br>
irretrievably dependent on history, so we wouldn't call any repeated
<br>
attempts at getting them hitched &quot;repetitions&quot; of the &quot;same&quot; kind of
<br>
event.)
<br>
<p>But that frequentist WOULD be comfortable answering question 3.
<br>
Furthermore, if this frequentist were really hard-core, she might reject
<br>
Bayes' Theorem altogether and try to find the frequency by actually
<br>
repeating the experiment a bunch of times.  That, the frequentist might
<br>
insist, would be the only way to guarantee that a meaningful result was
<br>
being calculated.
<br>
<p>So a frequentist like the kind I'M describing, as OPPOSED to what you did,
<br>
would literally write a program (or use an expensive pre-existing one,
<br>
depending on how much money was on hand) and do the experiment over and
<br>
over again, until an answer to question 3 was found to within some
<br>
experimental precision.  (Note that talking about &quot;precision&quot; here tends
<br>
to require some background assumptions like those Goertzel mentioned in
<br>
his answer to your question on SL4.  What could that &quot;precision&quot; mean
<br>
unless you assumed something Gaussian were going on in the background?)
<br>
<p>Looking back at the problem, I have no idea which barrel is red, (since
<br>
neither barrel was painted,) but, on the presumption that the barrel with
<br>
mostly blue tokens was painted blue, and the other barrel (which you
<br>
failed to notice had an EQUAL number of blue and red tokens) must have
<br>
been painted red.  Neither do I find myself able to say much about how the
<br>
frequentist, even my hard-core frequentist, has actively harmed her
<br>
statistical understanding...  even frequentists can plug numbers into
<br>
Bayes as well as anybody else, but sometimes they choose not to on
<br>
principle.
<br>
<p>But if I had to give an answer, it would be this: &quot;orthodox statisticians
<br>
cannot explain WHY the given answer is correct; they couldn't have
<br>
predicted the answer, and couldn't therefore have been &quot;surprised&quot; by the
<br>
results.&quot;  [Hence, they have left the path of science.]
<br>
<p>I appear to have narrowly met the word limit.  Well, hopefully my wordy
<br>
answer has served you better than the terse but certainly charming
<br>
response Elizer himself probably would have given.
