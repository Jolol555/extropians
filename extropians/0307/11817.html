<p>&quot;This seems to me to be the most likely possibility. Clarke said any

<br>
I don't think he goes far enough ... indistinguishable from Nature,
<br>
perhaps, or indistinguishable from the vacuum of space, maybe.&quot;
<br>
<p>I certainly would not consider that the most probably scenario.  So,
<br>
intelligent life has arrived from elsewhere, and we don't know about it
<br>
because it is undetectable?  Sounds like the old invisible dragon in
<br>
Carl sagan's garage to me.  
<br>
<p>We have no idea yet how probable life is to arise in the universe, if we
<br>
eventually find it reasonable to assume that intelligent life frequently
<br>
arises and produces technology, then their blatant absence from our
<br>
presence needs explaining.  The most likely scenario in the face of
<br>
current evidence is NOT that they are simply invisible, but here...
<br>
this is unscientific.  Their existing on levels we are unable to detect
<br>
is indistinguishable from not existing at all.  
<br>
<p>If it is found reasonable that intelligent life frequently evolves, then
<br>
their startling absence from our system stems from the most likely
<br>
explanation that, for some reason, they never start spreading out.  The
<br>
most likely reason for that is that they end up dying off for some
<br>
reason.  Of all the possible explanations for their absence, this is the
<br>
ONLY one that requires action on our part.  Why do they die out?  Was it
<br>
something they could have prevented, or was it unpreventable?  If it was
<br>
preventable, they obviously did not do enough to prevent it.
<br>
<p>Given the astounding history of civilization collapse, is it more
<br>
reasonable to assume we will rise above all our trivial violence and all
<br>
be god like super AI beings, or that eventually some idiot tribalist
<br>
does something so astoundingly stupid that all intelligent beings are
<br>
wiped out from that planet?  If you don't think this is a possibility,
<br>
read some of the luddites and greens descriptions of what humans are
<br>
doing to earth, nature, etc.  Phrases like raping, murdering, plundering
<br>
etc are used...  What does one do with rapists or murderers?  If that is
<br>
what a well motivated intelligent luddite thinks of humans, what might
<br>
he feel justified to do?  
<br>
<p>It seems unlikely to be coincidental that some people tend to embrace
<br>
the explanation that tends to require the least action.
<br>

<p>I've always thought that the most silly possibility.  For what
<br>
reason would they make their presence so difficult to detect?
<br>
If they're made of ordinary matter, there is a lot of energy
<br>
that they are willingly ignoring.
<br>
<p>I can just imagine Europeans in the 15th century asking,
<br>
&quot;how do we know that we have not already ourselves been
<br>
colonized by a great Chinese fleet?&quot;, or wondering &quot;should
<br>
we obey the Prime Directive if we encounter other peoples
<br>
below the equator or on faraway islands?&quot;.
<br>

<br>
I don't think he goes far enough ... indistinguishable from Nature,
<br>
perhaps, or indistinguishable from the vacuum of space, maybe. They
<br>
don't have to be made of ordinary matter at all. They could exist on
<br>
many levels that we are unable to detect. And they don't have to
<br>
necessarily be hiding from us. That simply may be where they live. And
<br>
have you considered that they my not care any more for our development
<br>
than we do about the future evolution of a tick?
<br>
<p>Whether we evolve to their level or not may be of statistical interest
<br>
only to critters who live within the quantum fluctuations of the
<br>
hydrogen in your coffee.
