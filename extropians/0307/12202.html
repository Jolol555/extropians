<p><em>&gt; Verbal thought is not the same as rational thought.  Rather, it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular kind of heavily abstract chain of deliberative statements, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often divorced from the intuitions that usually guide it.  Abstract verbal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning is only *more rational* if it *actually works better*...
</em><br>
<p>I think that that's a good reminder.  Rational thought ought to be
<br>
considered to take everything into account, even feelings.  A sublime
<br>
whole is the goal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are going to discuss genocide 'rationally' rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'instinctively' - and that should always be in quote marks -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you had better know the evolutionary psychology and game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory and everything else that lies behind those instincts,
</em><br>
<p>I think that this is putting too much of a qualification on it.
<br>
There are people of very sound thinking and good judgment that
<br>
can discuss the issues quite well without formal knowledge of
<br>
such things.  I know quite a bit of game theory, for example,
<br>
but my instincts were right on long before I learned it.  To
<br>
me, much of it was (and still is) common sense.  Nature has
<br>
indeed equipped many people with good instincts about a lot
<br>
of things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the reason why the instincts are there in the first place,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the ethical instincts are if anything far too *weak*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than the other way around. 
</em><br>
<p>For what purpose?  For the purposes of surviving in the environments
<br>
for which nature prepared us?  I dare say not.  I think you wish that
<br>
your own moral preferences (and probably mine as well) were more
<br>
instinctual---but that is mixing up things (crossing, IMO, the is/ought
<br>
barrier).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you don't understand the evolutionary psychology of genocide, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game theory of cooperation, the ethics of deep uncertainty about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, the historical outcomes of similar proposals, then all you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing by reasoning 'rationally' (verbally) is taking the safety catch off 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a deadly gun.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming that one can &quot;understand&quot; in effect (by means of having good
<br>
judgment or experience), then I'll agree.  This is a state of affairs
<br>
many describe as &quot;hyperrationality&quot;.  It often occurs, it seems to me,
<br>
in the so-called logical paradoxes.  One whose general knowledge or
<br>
judgment was being unfortunately suspended might really think that
<br>
some actual sort of problem arises from consideration of the truth
<br>
of &quot;if this sentence is true, then God exists&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see no reason why someone who starts reasoning verbally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ignorantly, about genocide under the banner of 'rationality',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be thought of any differently from someone who advocates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genocide with passionate hatred under the Romantic banner of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'honest feeling'.
</em><br>
<p>You sound as though *all* genocidal actions can be, or ought
<br>
to be dismissed, out of hand.  Have you read &quot;Ender's Game&quot;?
<br>
<p>And if that scenario isn't adequate to convince you, I am 
<br>
sure that you could think of one in sixty seconds or less
<br>
that would.
<br>
