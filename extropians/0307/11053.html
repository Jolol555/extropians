<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paradox of the Global Information Infrastructure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dana R. Fisher
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emerging global information infrastructure (GII) is set
<br>
to become a powerful tool in international relations.  As people 
<br>
within countries around the world develop the ability to access 
<br>
the Internet and the graphical interface called the World Wide 
<br>
Web, the borders separating states become more permeable; 
<br>
information can enter and leave without a visa.  Although 
<br>
commercial applications currently predominate, the GII is 
<br>
increasingly used in diplomacy and as an educational tool for 
<br>
academics, governments and activists.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GII has two major advantages.  First it is fast. 
<br>
Sending information across borders is no longer a matter of 
<br>
couriers and days; it is almost instantaneous.   Second, once the 
<br>
hardware is in place, it is inexpensive.  The latest Internet 
<br>
capabilities work much like video teleconferencing, except with a 
<br>
far lower cost. Even the &quot;older&quot; Internet resources give one the 
<br>
ability to have a spontaneous, textually-based conversation and 
<br>
send huge amounts of data quickly and very inexpensively.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By making communication between countries faster, easier and
<br>
cheaper, people in other countries are virtually next door 
<br>
neighbors.  The Nautilus Institute, for example, uses electronic 
<br>
communication to enhance its work on security and sustainable 
<br>
development in Asia.  Through the GII, the Institute involves 
<br>
people from over 30 countries in a virtual community of experts 
<br>
via the Northeast Asia Peace and Security Network (NAPSNet) and 
<br>
the Asia-Pacific Regional Environment Network (APRENet).  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the GII traverses territorial boundaries, it
<br>
supports the development of new types of global and regional 
<br>
relations.  In Asia, it is an important contributing force to 
<br>
emerging  regionalism.  The eighteen members of the Asia Pacific 
<br>
Economic Cooperation group (APEC) have agreed to establish an 
<br>
&quot;Asia Pacific Information Infrastructure&quot; which has enormous 
<br>
implications for the conduct of trade and investment, as well as 
<br>
diplomacy, in the region.  In addition, the GII was used to 
<br>
educate and coordinate the work behind the November APEC meetings 
<br>
in Osaka.  Primary documents, background information, and most 
<br>
recent research on APEC was available to anyone through the 
<br>
Internet.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) and citizen groups in
<br>
Asia are also increasingly turning to the GII to facilitate 
<br>
cross-border information flows and campaigns.  The Internet 
<br>
allows vast amounts of information to be shared cheaply and 
<br>
quickly and stored for future use.  The GII, in short, promotes 
<br>
new forms of grassroots international cooperation and advocacy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, however, the GII also reinforces social
<br>
inequities both inside and between countries.  Like other aspects 
<br>
of economic globalization, the spread of the GII is uneven.  It 
<br>
may increase social fragmentation within state borders and 
<br>
between countries even as it forges new communities.  With the 
<br>
growth of the GII comes the risk that developing countries and 
<br>
the less affluent in societies will become more disenfranchised.  
<br>
Many developing countries are not yet able to take full advantage 
<br>
of the resources available through the GII.  In addition, many 
<br>
sectors of developed societies can not or do not choose to use 
<br>
the new technology.  Because the growth of the GII does not 
<br>
follow the usual lines drawn by those who have telephones and 
<br>
televisions, this social fragmentation will exclude many who are 
<br>
presently considered the technological haves resulting in a whole 
<br>
new sector of society:  the have somes.  Paradoxically, one of 
<br>
the largest populations of have somes are governments, many of 
<br>
whom are as disconnected from the new technology as those who 
<br>
cannot afford phone lines.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As participation on the Internet explodes, people and
<br>
countries without access can only lag behind.  Unable to receive 
<br>
information easily and inexpensively, those without or unable to 
<br>
afford access will remain less informed and less involved in the 
<br>
international dialogue.  Many countries can afford the Internet 
<br>
but are limited in their ability to use the World Wide Web. 
<br>
Those countries receive only some of the benefits of the new 
<br>
technology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a June 1995 workshop on Harnessing the Communication
<br>
Revolution in Beijing, China, representatives from developing 
<br>
countries expressed their concern that they were &quot;missing it.&quot; 
<br>
As the World Wide Web--which needs consistent telephone lines and 
<br>
relatively fast computers-- grows more popular, countries without 
<br>
strong telecommunications infrastructures will not be able to 
<br>
access the latest tools on the GII [See Box].  Even today, many 
<br>
developing countries do not have open, public access to the 
<br>
Internet.        
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the majority of the information available through
<br>
the GII-- which includes files, conferences, mail and hypertext-- 
<br>
is English based.  To compound other factors that limit many 
<br>
people's use of the Internet, those without skills in English 
<br>
would find it very difficult to make use of a number of the 
<br>
resources that are available on-line.  Until the GII has the 
<br>
resources to support translation, international dialogues are 
<br>
significantly limited by the singularity of the language.  Thus, 
<br>
the seemingly perfect tool for international communication 
<br>
actually isolates a large percentage of the world from the most 
<br>
hyperactive level of human communication.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, the Global Information Infrastructure will
<br>
grow enormously in terms of applications and usage.  But who will 
<br>
be able to take advantage of this growth is not certain. 
<br>
Although it will make it even easier for citizens of the world to 
<br>
communicate quickly and inexpensively at all levels of 
<br>
international society, many organizations, people and even 
<br>
countries could be left out of the dialogue.  In short, commitment 
<br>
to include the developing world and the less advantaged in 
<br>
international dialogues is inadequate.   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of the GII has made hard copies of many materials
<br>
obsolete.  Because the new technology renders obsolete expensive 
<br>
and labor intensive distribution of  hard copies, those who do 
<br>
not have Internet access are also  missing information they might 
<br>
once have received.  To ensure that the GII serves its purpose as 
<br>
a communication tool for everyone, we must consciously design 
<br>
information services that are tailored to the local needs and 
<br>
technological capabilities of all constituencies, including those 
<br>
in the developing world and the have-nots inside each society.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nautilus provides its on-line services--NAPSNet and APRENet-
<br>
-free of charge to anyone with access to the Internet.  By making 
<br>
its documents and information available through e-mail as well as 
<br>
on the World Wide Web, even those who cannot afford or do not 
<br>
have access to anything but e-mail are included in the dialogue
