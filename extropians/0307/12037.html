&nbsp;The &quot;reality&quot; of Hitler should have been dealt with any time from
<br>
<em>&gt; 1921 when he took over the &quot;German Workers Party&quot; to 1924 when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was written to 1938 when the Czechoslovakian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absorption was begun or 1939 the tragedy in Poland began [1].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question becomes precisely &quot;How much *reality* do you want?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Good question. I think that once it is established that he is willing to
<br>
take his ideas to the point of action, he should be removed. Saddam was a
<br>
killer, no doubt about that. This was a good enough reason to remove him.
<br>
All that talk of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; and &quot;preemptive strike&quot; make
<br>
sense because of his previous actions.
<br>
<p>Here is something I read about North Korea:
<br>
<p>Soon also reported that the bodies of hundreds of prisoners served as
<br>
fertilizer for orchards that produced especially large and sweet apples,
<br>
pears, peaches and plums reserved for senior party and police officials. She
<br>
herself was there when 150 prisoners were buried under these trees.
<br>
<p>She said that in the meantime, prisoners were kept starving to such a degree
<br>
that they ate the raw flesh of rats they had caught coming out of their
<br>
latrine holes. She described special punishment cells, 24 inches wide and 44
<br>
inches high, where people were confined for seven to 10 days, without being
<br>
able to stand up straight, or sit or lie down.
<br>
<p>Such confinement was the penalty for &quot;offenses such as leaving an oily mark
<br>
on clothes, failing to memorize the president's New Year message or repeated
<br>
failure to meet work quotas.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;When the prisoners are released from the cells, their legs are badly bent,
<br>
with frostbite in the winter, and so they can hardly work,&quot; Soon went on.
<br>
&quot;Many victims are permanently crippled from lack of adequate exercise and
<br>
eventually died as a result of the work resumed immediately after the
<br>
lease.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>This to me is enough justification to go in and rid the world of these evil
<br>
people. I have no problem with the US working as a world police force. I
<br>
wonder at times, what right we have to judge other countries by our
<br>
standards, but then I remember that I have concluded that all human beings,
<br>
and most other living things, are entitled to a life free of unnecessary
<br>
killing and torture. (I have yet to establish at which point I draw the line
<br>
here on other animals). I see nothing wrong with removing such people from
<br>
power or killing those who defend these jerks from our troops.
<br>
<p>Still, I see it as a matter of punishment for past atrocities rather than
<br>
preventing further ones.
