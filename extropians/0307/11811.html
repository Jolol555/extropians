From: &quot;Anders Sandberg&quot; &lt;&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Exactly. This is my own personal guess at the answer of the Fermi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradox. But it has the problem of invoking the existence of some kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics we do not know about; not an unlikely assumption or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prediction, but rather unsatisfying since it does not tell us anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cannot be tested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or can it? The assumption says that there should exist a domain in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature where structures of extremely high complexity can persist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform at least Turing-computable operations, and that this domain does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not look out of the ordinary to us. The current candidates seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either dark matter (essentially going back to &quot;some unknown stuff&quot;) or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spacetime on the Planck scale. This case is interesting: it wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprise me if one could prove that spacetime evolution in GR can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing type computation (proof sketch: one could implement a billiard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ball computer with black holes using very massive cosmic strings or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wormholes as reflectors - but a real proof needs to show that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable enough), but it would be needed to show that stable information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; storage was also possible in principle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I have sympathy with the general line of thought, in fact I've argued before
<br>
that contemporary science should take serious the possibility of a missing
<br>
science. If we think of the universe in its early stages only physical
<br>
phenomena were present--the phenomena currently studied by physics--later
<br>
chemical,
<br>
biological, psychological, sociological and economic phenomena emerged.
<br>
Surely the question arises whether there process might continue, i.e.,
<br>
whether there might be further (emergent) development that calls for a new
<br>
science.
<br>
Once you allow for this possibility then indeed it is quite a natural
<br>
thought to think that the explanation for the Fermi paradox lies with the
<br>
missing science. (With reductionist tendencies one might want to insist that
<br>
physics is incomplete rather than a new level of phenomena (requiring a new
<br>
science) has emerged). This new emergent level may be inscrutable to us,
<br>
which I suppose would not be satisfying even if true. However, even we
<br>
accept this explanation it seems that there must be some &quot;top down&quot; effect.
<br>
If all advanced life forms disappear into dark matter it is still a mystery
<br>
that as a matter of bad housekeeping they didn't leave one single genesis
<br>
probe around, i.e., a single von
<br>
Neumann machine that is bent on populating the universe with life forms at
<br>
our stage of development. The top down effect is that all such genesis
<br>
probes get thwarted by the emergent phenomena. If this is the case then
<br>
there must be some &quot;iron laws&quot; of development, be they physical, social or
<br>
political or emergent that guarantee that not even a single rogue genesis
<br>
gets loose in the universe. This means that we might not be as free as we
<br>
appear to be. Consider that we should soon have the technology to launch
<br>
just such a genesis probe. The iron laws say that this must fail.
