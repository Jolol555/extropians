Someone buy that man a pint  :  )
<br>
<p>The last few months, it has gotten more and more enjoyable on this list. 
<br>
I've felt welcome, interested, and encouraged. I haven't been able to 
<br>
give much, due to being up to my monitors in other projects.
<br>
I've been attracted back again and again though, because of some 
<br>
stunning examples of  open intelligence and flexible logic, being 
<br>
applied creatively to make things better, by a bunch of people who are 
<br>
in my opinion the epitome of integrity under pressure, online (or 
<br>
offline, those whom I have met.) This doesn't apply to all the people on 
<br>
the list, just some of the most competent.
<br>
Since I first joined the list (2-3 years ago), the constant 
<br>
determination, day by day and month by month, of these people to _make 
<br>
things better_ has been a shining example to me. Their patience, in 
<br>
dealing with some truly appalling incidents seems to me (almost) 
<br>
supernatural.
<br>
That to me is the embodiment of being Extropian.
<br>
On this list I have met inspirers, creators, movers and doers. I have 
<br>
met some of the people who are now my colleagues; we are working 
<br>
together on projects which otherwise could not have happened.
<br>
People here have shared with me their research, designs and data; this 
<br>
has led to new innovation in my own work and tech design.
<br>
Other list colleagues have given me essential feedback on my papers and 
<br>
book in everything from American grammar to phosphorylation.
<br>
You may see this as a one-way process; as I said, I have not had much 
<br>
time to contribute  anything myself, that I know of, _to_ the list...
<br>
But your ideas and your views and your books and your information have 
<br>
gone forward with me, into the channels of 'the establishment', into 
<br>
hospitals and schools and clinics where I lecture and work, onto BBC 
<br>
World + News24 TV, into documentaries, books, a registered charity, and 
<br>
other, hands-on, patient treatment projects which you may well never 
<br>
hear of, but that does not mean that they are not going on.
<br>
You have changed me, from a man living in hope, to a man living in 
<br>
optimistic determination, who is now about to throw his life, and life 
<br>
savings (and those of several of his friends!) into Extropian projects 
<br>
&nbsp;:  )  
<br>
...I hope you all realize that all this success is entirely ExI's fault.
<br>
&nbsp;Anyone who feels guilty should apologize to a big bunch of blind folks 
<br>
who now have text to speech, thanks to this list, the patients we have 
<br>
on CR, thanks to this list, who are getting better quicker, and the 
<br>
producer of the documentary we are making, thanks to this list, about 
<br>
the sudden increase in public interest in 'Extropian' issues, 
<br>
and...(send me an SAE and I'll forward a full list of people to 
<br>
apologize to).
<br>
Extropes, you've been more than an example to me, you've been the family 
<br>
and the teachers and the friends I somehow managed to bypass in my youth.
<br>
To quote an old Irish song...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You've made me, for better or worse, the fool that I am or the 
<br>
wise man I'll be&quot;.
<br>
<p>...'Thank you' is totally inadequate...
