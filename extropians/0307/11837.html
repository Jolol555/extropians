<em>&gt;I can understand why people accuse me of hubris, but Robin?  Robin is

</em><br>
<p>By the standards of most people, I have to be way way into the upper tail 
<br>
of the distribution of hubris.  I propose radical new forms of governance 
<br>
and social organizations, I propose radical theories of common social 
<br>
behaviors, I claim we know some things about distant future technologies 
<br>
such as uploads and their social implications, I endorse relatively 
<br>
straightforward consequential ethics when most people would retreat into 
<br>
deontology, and I am a cryonics customer.  If that isn't hubris, I'm not 
<br>
sure what is.
<br>
<p>I do agonize about the fact that all else equal being that far out into the 
<br>
high hubris tail strongly suggests that I'm mistaken in my hubris.  But in 
<br>
the end, this agonizing doesn't seem to change my views very much, besides 
<br>
adding a few more qualifiers now and then, so it's not clear that I really 
<br>
take it that seriously.  Maybe you'll give me anti-hubris points for 
<br>
stating this publicly, but I'm not sure you should.
