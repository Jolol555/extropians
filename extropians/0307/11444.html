</em><br>
<p>Actually, I strongly disagree with &quot;what you do after being briefly and 
<br>
privately informed of evidence sufficient to convince a neutral observer&quot; 
<br>
as a metric of what people &quot;really want&quot;.  So what if the evidence is 
<br>
strong enough to convince a neutral observer?  If the person doesn't 
<br>
believe the evidence upon being &quot;briefly informed&quot;, their volition (the 
<br>
cognitive system constituting their volition) is just the same as it was 
<br>
before.  Any gaps or problem areas in their volition will still be there. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A warning label that someone ignores doesn't help, doesn't change 
<br>
anything, and is not a metric of what people really want.  Extrapolating a 
<br>
major change in someone's volition is a major problem, and &quot;briefly 
<br>
informing&quot; someone doesn't get to grips with that problem at all.  There 
<br>
is no way to &quot;briefly&quot; inform a Christian that there is no life after 
<br>
death and ask if they would &quot;really want&quot; cryonics.  It may seem *fair* to 
<br>
give someone enough evidence to convince a neutral observer, and it is 
<br>
certainly very inconvenient to have to jump through more hoops than that. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But so what?  What does fairness to the experimenter or convenience for 
<br>
the experimenter have to do with it?  In reality it is just an unfair and 
<br>
inconvenient and complicated problem.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I disagree with the premise that people would betray the 
<br>
tribe if privately and successfully informed that this was, in fact, the 
<br>
dilemma they were faced with.  Who says that this is what all people or 
<br>
most people would do?  I should expect being successfully informed to 
<br>
bring moral principles and retention of self-respect into play as the 
<br>
primary components of the decision.  Can you name anyone who was 
<br>
successfully informed... by studying evolutionary psychology over a period 
<br>
of years, say... who is *not* now trying to cut the puppet strings?  It's 
<br>
a highly biased sample when you consider the kind of personality that 
<br>
would stick to studying the issue in the first place, but still: people 
<br>
who *are* successfully informed of the puppet strings generally seem to 
<br>
want to cut them.  Sample bias, availability bias, consensus bias, but 
<br>
it's still how things look offhand.
