<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, then at what age may one ask a child to leave one's house?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ...It's just that you cannot *tell* a child to leave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ### On the contrary, since you are the owner of your house, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; may demand that others leave it, with or without a reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyone living for an extended time in a residence has certain rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For example, if you let your friend stay in your house for free, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot just up and kick him out one day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Is this an actual rule of law? Is it statutory in many jurisdictions, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common law?
</em><br>
<p>What planet are you guys living on?  ;-)   To evict a
<br>
child from your house would frequently land you in
<br>
jail for endangering a minor, among other crimes, e.g.,
<br>
failing to pay for the support of a child, child abandonment.
<br>
Perish the thought.  One is *responsible* for one's children
<br>
---the question most people on this list are probably
<br>
thinking about is whether or not that includes giving
<br>
the child what he or she wants to eat, or what outside
<br>
agencies deem to be good to eat.
<br>
<p>(I think that soon if any child chooses to be a vegetarian,
<br>
for example, then regardless of the dietary preferences of
<br>
his parents, they will have to conform to his wishes.  It
<br>
will be entertaining to watch as the kids realize the lever
<br>
they'll hold in this situation.)
<br>
<p>Rafal, I think that Randy is right.  I'm not sure
<br>
how one would go about evicting a non-family adult
<br>
who had lived at your place for a period of time.
<br>
Certainly if he's been either *paying*, or has an
<br>
agreement to pay, then (whether he has actually 
<br>
ever paid or not), he is protected by tenant's rights.
<br>
It is often a lengthy process to evict tenants.  Usually
<br>
they can remain up to about six months before you can 
<br>
legally get the sheriff to physically evict them.
<br>
