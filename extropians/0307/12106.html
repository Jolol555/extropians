<p>Spike, I would urge you to rethink this.  The problem
<br>
is *not* the availability of carbon (go over the
<br>
fundamental equations of stellar nucleosynthesis).
<br>
The problem is *where* it is available within a solar
<br>
system.  The problem is that most of the C gets
<br>
locked up as CO or CO2 in the outer regions of a
<br>
solar system -- the dynamics of which -- i.e. how
<br>
many comets (and what size) can you deliver to a
<br>
planet annually? becomes a critical factor.
<br>
<p>Answer these questions -- How much C is the Earth
<br>
receiving annually from outer space?  How much C
<br>
is being subducted annually?  What are the radioactive
<br>
isotope levels required (in the core of initial planet
<br>
formation) to sustain carbon recycling (through volcanic
<br>
activity)?
<br>
<p>When you can answer those questions (on a statistical
<br>
solar system basis) *then* maybe we can talk about
<br>
your perspective seriously (not that I disagree with
<br>
it but I want the beef on the table).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Still, the carbon cycle is imperfect, and as time went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, we can imagine it becoming ever less efficient in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recycing the carbon, as the crust becomes thicker and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mantle ever less accessible.
</em><br>
<p>Spike, give me a break, you must be talking about
<br>
&quot;cave men&quot; being the maximal level of development.
<br>
Any advanced technological civilization is going
<br>
to trump the architecture of its planet (to the
<br>
point of disassembling it) -- so for this scenario
<br>
to work you have to make the planet very &quot;primitive&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not surprising that Robert should suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evolution of non-carbonbased lifeforms, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he has theorized one: the Bradburian silicon-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M-Brain.
</em><br>
<p>Actually silicon is only a partial sub-component
<br>
of an MBrain.  I thought I had made this clear in
<br>
various conversations, but in reviewing my papers
<br>
the &quot;picture&quot; may not be present.
<br>
<p>Please see:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/MBlayout.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/MBlayout.html</a>
<br>
<p>It is a very brief document that may explain this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we can see this as the fourth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical step in evolution, that absolutely requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going thru each of the first three:  1) evolution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, 2) development of multicellular lifeforms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) the development of technology-capable lifeforms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) construction of MBrains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Claim: there is no possible path to step 4 without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going thru and surviving each of the previous 3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Claim: the previous 3 steps absolutely require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carbon based life.
</em><br>
<p>I will not dispute (3).  I would question whether (4)
<br>
is necessary -- [for example there may be loopholes
<br>
in the laws of physics as we currently know them that
<br>
enable (4) to be avoided.  Certainly the jury is
<br>
still out on whether (4) [in a specific form] is
<br>
required.]  But the most iffy assertion IMO might
<br>
be (2).  Yes multicellular lifeforms certainly help
<br>
in the evolutionary process -- but it would seem to
<br>
be a stretch to assert this is the only path that
<br>
evolution must follow.
