<p>### Probably a bad idea. The freezing damage (microstructural) is extensive,
<br>
maybe reversible with some as yet not-invented technique, but quite possibly
<br>
too severe after all. Vitrification, and the, recently proposed by Alcor,

intermediate temerature storage at just below the glass transition phase,
<br>
should greatly reduce the damage, even including the gross fractures.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned not with how much &quot;damage&quot; the freezing process does, from
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of whether ice crystal formation of just dumping a head into

</em><br>
<em>&gt; without oxygen.
</em><br>
<p>### You are correct to look at the problem from the information theory point
<br>
of view, but the specific application of your reasoning is IMO
<br>
inappropriate - freezing does much more damage in terms of information loss
<br>
(just a guess, prompted by looking at fresh-frozen brain sections) than a
<br>
perfusion and vitrification process, even if they take longer to complete. I
<br>
don't think it is reasonable to expect that vitrified neurons will ever be
<br>
brought back to life in some direct (biological) way, the only likely way is
<br>
through the extraction of functional information from them to guide
<br>
reconstruction in silico or in another biological substrate, as you
<br>
described below, and vitrification is likely to preserve this information
<br>
much better than anything else (except maybe fixation by perfusion).
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If dendrites and axons retract into the cell body within half an hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the neuron has been starved of oxygen (!!!),
</em><br>
<p>### This is not true.
