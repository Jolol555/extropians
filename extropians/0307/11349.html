<em>&gt;&gt; Oh, but there *is* something very important at stake: who you

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; punishment that you mete out, to turn them into someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; really believes that on some level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an important point, but I still cannot credit it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that very compliant especially young children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps might get brainwashed in exactly the way you suggest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I also acknowledge your additional explanation below.)
</em><br>
<p>I don't know how effective it is for adults to do this, but
<br>
since this is how children learn to be adults in the first
<br>
place, I wouldn't credit an assertion that it can't work. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But anyone who has the presence of self to have resisted so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard and so long, why had she not the ability to say and do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they wanted, yet continue to lead a quite separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner life?  I would have had no trouble after the age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eleven or so.
</em><br>
<p>Some people can do this, and some people cannot, or refuse to.
<br>
<p>You appear to be asserting that Multiple Personality Disorder
<br>
is preferable to less than two years of physical discomfort.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it that they simply cannot act?  I'm not a bad actor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (even though many of my associates say that I am, for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odd reason).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moreover, I do not believe that this girl subscribes to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory on an intellectual level.  I wonder if she had managed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn at a tender age that if you scream long enough and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do whatever else it takes, you *can* win the contest of wills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with your parents.  &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child&quot;, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancient wisdom has it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Listen---I do apologize for the troll-like quality of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last remark, but to soften it here on this list would be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give in to pressure, to submit to domination, to surrender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my soul, to lose my identity.)
</em><br>
<p>It may be that she did learn that.  Nevertheless, it isn't
<br>
a good excuse to use force against her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I know, intellectually, that I'm capable, but there's something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very deep in me that is only satisfied if I'm very far from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; goal, and makes actually finishing any project harder than stopping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just shy of success.  I often &quot;come to&quot; saying &quot;What the hell am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; doing?&quot; when I find myself playing a video game for hours on end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; when I would otherwise have finished a weeks-long project that day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this part, I intuit, doesn't really add up.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other factors must be at play.
</em><br>
<p>Really?  I'm interested to know what your opinions are on that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; There's a difference between a minor inconvenience from someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fancies themselves in authority, and the horror of having that person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; insist that you tell them that you believe that they are right, day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; after day, for years.  Eventually, you'll really agree that they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right.  You may think that you could resist that indefinitely, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you might be right, but children are, by nature, far more malleable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than you are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, some children at any rate.  But those teenagers who are such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebels?
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that you think &quot;being a rebel&quot; is a genetic 
<br>
predisposition,
<br>
such that their brains are actually different and not susceptible to the
<br>
ordinary mind-altering behaviors that the rest of us are?
