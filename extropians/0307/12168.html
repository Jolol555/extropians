</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Can you briefly and positively describe what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; libertarianism *is* about in your view.  How do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see libertarianism in relation to globalism and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; global economy and law? The notion of a free state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for instance can be looked at from two different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standpoints. One could be that the personal liberties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that one would like to be able to take for granted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as a citizen as ones birthright are not being respected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and that as a consequence the best practical way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to get them respected is to come together with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likeminded others and form a state. But is the aim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of that state to keep the rest of the world out or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the aim of that state to create a building space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in which to live free and demonstrate a principle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so that that principles held by that state can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extended further?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The aim of the state is to create a protected space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which high trust institutions can develop and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where individuals can learn to live high trust lifestyles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and live with high trust attitudes toward their fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man. 
</em><br>
<p>I definately *like* and see considerable merit in the 
<br>
idea of forming such a state Mike.  In fact back around
<br>
november 2002 I started a thread &quot;The Principles of 
<br>
Founding a Virtual Country&quot; (which unfortunately seems
<br>
to be too too old to link to in the bbs archive). 
<br>
<p>Although I think I have relatively few illusions about
<br>
how difficult it would be to establish such as state in
<br>
practice I do not believe that it would be impossible.
<br>
<p>I think I get what you mean by &quot;high trust&quot; institutions 
<br>
and lifestyles, but it also occurs to me that &quot;trust&quot; can
<br>
sometimes be something of a naive thing, where too 
<br>
great a reliance may be placed on other people, institutions
<br>
etc for one's own good. I'm thinking of the old maxim
<br>
about 'the price of freedom being external vigilance'.
<br>
<p>What do you mean by &quot;high trust&quot;? Is this notion of 
<br>
high trust yet incorporated into any 'manifesto' or draft
<br>
free state constitution?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only within such a plenum can a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society develop and remain stable. Free trade is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine goal, as is free immigration, but such policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should only be permitted between similarly high trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies.
</em><br>
<p>Personally I would agree that there is a lot of merit
<br>
in exploring both the philosophical and practical 
<br>
aspects in the development of such a state. I am glad
<br>
that there is a group that is giving this idea a run. 
<br>
<p>With respect to free trade and free immigration I 
<br>
see your point. One of the consequences of living
<br>
in a contingent universe and each having to budget
<br>
our time and our money (formally or by default) is
<br>
that when we come to consider the future we would
<br>
like to build in its multidimensionality and the present
<br>
in which we live with its myriad shortcomings we
<br>
come to realise that there is no choice, if we are to
<br>
be practical and make progress at all, but to 
<br>
recognize, prioritise and form some cohensive plan
<br>
for sequencing the order in which we will try and
<br>
change things. In this sense I can see how, for a
<br>
time, a free state, to establish itself would need to
<br>
delay or consider carefully free trade and free
<br>
immigration. 
<br>
<p>Related also to the trust aspect though, and I am
<br>
sure that this would be an issue that you would 
<br>
have considered, historically it seems that distrust
<br>
between certain groups of people has manifest itself
<br>
into intense competition for resources and at the
<br>
extreme into the classical arms race. How do you
<br>
see a proposed free state defending itself against
<br>
outside aggression and do you think that that it
<br>
can still innovate in with the same degree of 
<br>
urgency if it does not engage in free trade for
<br>
instance with other states?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look, for example, at the European Union (no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of a libertarian society, but far better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the world). Immigration between member
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states is pretty wide open now, because all such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member states have attained some degree of high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust in their societies and can therefore freely trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and immigrate between each other. The primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigration problems in the EU are from immigrants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from non-member states, particularly non-member
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states which sustain low trust societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can envisage a free state as being potentially either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defensive or offensive from a libertarian perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depending on how wide a group of people one aims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to extend liberties too. Would a free state be like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; last enclave of the American dream or would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see it as a prototype to be copied and extended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; globally? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Copy it and extend it globally, but do not leave your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original, or your copies, wide open to dilution and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissolution by trade and immigration from low trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies...
</em><br>
<p>Ok. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THis is not to say that trade and immigration should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be completely prevented. Quite the contrary, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products produced in non-free environments should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be tariffed, and the tariff money used toward efforts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increase freedom and trust in those environments, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if not liberating them entirely, as well as defending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free and high trust societies against the depredations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of non-free and low trust societies. 
</em><br>
<p>I see, but how would the level of tariffs be determined?
<br>
This sort of leads into the idea of what sort of government
<br>
the state would have. 
<br>
<p>One of the substantial difficulties I see in forming such 
<br>
a state is that modern states are remarkable complex
<br>
and that whilst one might be able to find relatively large
<br>
numbers of libertarians that are ideologically predisposed
<br>
towards forming and living in such a state, many of these
<br>
folk are likely to themselves have grown to maturity in 
<br>
economies and societies that encourage specialisation in
<br>
working roles and also knowledge base. The sorts of 
<br>
true general knowledge holding state builders that I 
<br>
imagine would I think be fairly thin on the ground and
<br>
might face considerable difficulty pursuading some of
<br>
the younger more idealistic would be pioneers that 
<br>
the prototype for the state even in design is likely to 
<br>
be more complex that they may suspect on first 
<br>
impressions. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Immigrants from such societies should be welcomed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as refugees and defectors, but should be required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go through far more rigorous civics, poli-sci, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history training, as well as literacy proficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before becoming citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed if your state was well conceived and founded, 
<br>
(I would see this as involving serious consideration of
<br>
education, law and order, the relationship of the state
<br>
with other states, government, economics etc) it could
<br>
in fact be very successful in competing in a number
<br>
of areas with other states even trading only with that 
<br>
subset of other states with whom it was satisfied were
<br>
high trust. Such a state could indeed become a highly
<br>
desirable place in which to live.  But the logistics of
<br>
rolling such a state into existence given it would need
<br>
a population of a certain size and a populace that
<br>
is on the whole well educated and yet willing to do 
<br>
work in the short term perhaps like agriculture that
<br>
is necessary for the state to become sustainable in
<br>
the first place seem to be significant ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Libertarianism will only be secure when the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is free.
</em><br>
<p>I like the way you are thinking Mike, but the challenge
<br>
of beginning and beginning intelligently and with a strong
<br>
chance of success would seem to throw up the need to
<br>
categorise and prioritise. This would be because in the 
<br>
short term certain types of freedom in the fledgling free
<br>
state would actually be less than the sort of freedom
<br>
on the same dimension that at least some of the states
<br>
citizens may have enjoyed prior to joining it. We often
<br>
hear of freedoms describes as a list of  'freedom toos'
<br>
but often just as important are the 'freedom froms' -
<br>
religion is the obvious example that comes to mind. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
