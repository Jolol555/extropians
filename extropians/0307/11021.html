</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has evolved consciousness which works like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee's machine!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this bizarre world (call it World X), animals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are conscious as they are in our world, but due to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quirk of their brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemistry, their consciousness is destroyed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-created 100 times a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second.  Yet this has no impact on their behavior,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it happens so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without their knowledge, slaughter and death is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occuring on a horrendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale, with every conscious being on World X dying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 times a second.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The terrible part is, since this does not affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their behavior, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no reason for evolution to avoid this outcome.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuous, connected consciousness, like us, has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over one who suffers the fate of having his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being destroyed.  Therefore there is a substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance that worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where consciousness evolves may indeed be just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World X.  Thank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goodness that we were one of the lucky worlds!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I just had a horrifying thought... too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrible to share with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others... about our own world.  I shudder to even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine it.  But could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it be true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>Not only could it be true, but it **is** true(gasp!).
<br>
<p>Synaptic cycling--fire, pause to reset (horrors!),
<br>
ready once again to fire--means we are kilt and
<br>
resurrected every fraction of a second exactly as Lee
<br>
hypotheticalized(egad!).  Well, perhaps not 'exactly'
<br>
so, since the synaptic firing may not be globally
<br>
synchronized, every neuron marching in step.
<br>
<p>[Then again, I read not so long ago, that the neurons
<br>
engaged in a coherent thought all fire in a
<br>
synchronized fashion.  I guess that means that, to
<br>
whatever extent you're 'incoherent' and ego-less--I
<br>
don't know how to describe this or if it even makes
<br>
sense--like say with intention and active
<br>
participation in the thought stream turned
<br>
off--Oooooohm, oooooohm, oooooohm--then your identity
<br>
is continuous since synaptic asynchronicity means some
<br>
neuronal fraction is 'always on'--some firing, some
<br>
resetting, some resting and ready to fire.  
<br>
<p>Thus, if you--there's that troublesome little semantic
<br>
conundrum: which 'you' or aspect set of a temporally 
<br>
and/or compositionally dynamic 'you' construct,
<br>
slippery little devil, are we talking about here--are
<br>
in 'thought-quieted' receive mode, that you, the
<br>
thought-quieted you, is 'there' with uninterrupted
<br>
continuity (except of course at the vastly shorter
<br>
Plank time/quantized time 'interval', but never mind
<br>
that).  Only when 'you' (that problem again) intrude
<br>
on this continuous asynchronicity by **responding** to
<br>
the sensory input stream (and I haven't even bothered
<br>
to consider about the automatic/reflexive
<br>
'lower-level' processing of the input stream which
<br>
that 
<br>
'unconsciously'(preconsciously?) filters and shapes it
<br>
into grist for the mill of higher level thought slash
<br>
'consciousness'), and forcing the trade-off of
<br>
destructive/constructive synchronicity, only then do
<br>
you 'suffer' the fate of millisecond scale cyclic
<br>
identity extinguishment/reinitialization.
<br>
<p>Just a thought, ...a thought, ...a thought, ...a
<br>
thought,...a thought, ...a thought, ...a thought, ...a
<br>
thought,...a thought,...a thought, ...a thought, ...a
<br>
thought,...a thought, ...]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;SYSTEM FAILURE&gt; 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;That's the whole problem with science. You've got a
<br>
bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of
<br>
unimaginable wonder.&quot;
