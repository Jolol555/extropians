Barbara has just posted a rich analysis of the key issues in the
<br>
discussion &quot;Radical Suggestions&quot;.  First, a brief comment on the
<br>
first thing she wrote before getting to the pertinent article I
<br>
read (which is unfortunately no longer on-line)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert wrote:

<em>&gt; &gt; Point taken.  I might offer that perhaps there are 3 codes --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a legal code, a moral code and an instinctual code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, if what you're saying is that humans are genetically predisposed to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This much is certainly true.  Suppose that during the plutonium project,
<br>
experienced engineers had simply used their intuition to decide how to
<br>
place the charges to achieve the right forces necessary to compact the
<br>
plutonium.  The sciences, of course, offer innumerable examples of this
<br>
kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, some of the research I've read indicates that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not genetically predisposed to approach decision making in a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner. (I've read a lot of research on decision making, because my PhD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissertation [not completed] was on the topic of how people make business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions). In an emergency where complex decision making is required, even
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but what do you think of the following article?  This is
<br>
extremely fun reading---as well as IMO extremely important.
<br>
Somewhere between the perhaps &quot;hyperrational&quot; view you have
<br>
just espoused and the following lies the truth.
<br>
<p>Especially interesting is the story of how George Soros gets
<br>
key information from whether his back is hurting him or not,
<br>
the amazing comeuppance that the U.S. Marine Corp received
<br>
at the hands of the Wall Street brokers, and how the military
<br>
has recently taken note.

<p>How to Think With Your Gut---How the geniuses behind the Osbournes, the Mini, Federal Express, and Starbucks followed their
<br>
instincts and reached success. By Thomas A. Stewart, November 2002 Issue of Business 2.0
<br>
<p>Getting in Touch With Your Gut---It's simple, really: Just get out of your own way.
<br>
<p>Psychologists have a term to describe people who are in unusually close contact with their gut feelings -- &quot;high intuitives.&quot; While
<br>
you can't teach such skills the way you teach multiplication tables, everyone can hone their instincts to some degree. Here are a
<br>
few guidelines:
<br>
<p>Practice, practice. This is the most important thing. &quot;Gut instinct is basically a form of pattern recognition,&quot; says Howard
<br>
Gardner, a Harvard professor and psychologist. The more you practice, the more patterns you intuitively recognize. List decisions
<br>
you've made that turned out right -- and mistakes, too. Then reconstruct the thinking. Where did intuition come in? Was it right or
<br>
wrong? Are there patterns? Highly intuitive people often let themselves be talked out of good ideas. &quot;Generally you're better with
<br>
either people or things,&quot; says Manhattan psychologist and executive coach Dee Soder. If you're intuitively gifted about people,
<br>
write down your first impressions of new colleagues, customers, and so on -- you want to hold on to those gut reactions.
<br>
<p>Learn to listen. People come up with all sorts of reasons for ignoring what their gut is trying to tell them. Flavia Cymbalista has
<br>
developed a decision-making approach adapted from a psychological technique known as &quot;focusing.&quot; She calls it MarketFocusing, and
<br>
she uses it to teach businesspeople to find the &quot;felt sense&quot; that tells them they know something they can't articulate. &quot;You have to
<br>
express your willingness to listen to what the felt sense has to say, without an agenda of your own,&quot; she says.
<br>
<p>Tell stories. Fictionalize a problem as a business school case or as happening to someone else. That can free up your imagination.
<br>
Dave Snowden, director of IBM's (IBM) Cynefin Centre for Organisational Complexity in Wales, has been working with antiterrorism
<br>
experts and finds that they think more creatively if he poses problems set in a different time -- the Civil War, for example.
<br>
Another kind of storytelling is what cognitive psychologist Gary Klein calls a &quot;pre-mortem&quot;: Imagine that your project has failed
<br>
and gather the team to assess what went wrong.
<br>
<p>Breed gut thinkers. Dismantle the obstacles that prevent people from using their guts. High turnover rates, for example, are
<br>
inimical to developing the deep expertise that hones intuition. Since gut feelings are inherently hard to express, don't let people
<br>
jump on a dissenter who hesitantly says, &quot;I'm not sure ... &quot; Instead, say &quot;Tell us more.&quot; Some leaders go around the table twice at
<br>
meetings to give people a chance to put hunches into words. To sharpen your intuitive thinking, you have to get out of your own way;
<br>
to foster it among those around you, you have to get out of their way too.
<br>
<p>The practical implications of all this are profound. People who make decisions for a living are coming to realize that in complex or
<br>
chaotic situations -- a battlefield, a trading floor, or today's brutally competitive business environment -- intuition usually
<br>
beats rational analysis. And as science looks closer, it is coming to see that intuition is not a gift but a skill. And, like any
<br>
skill, it's something you can learn.
<br>
<p>To make sense of this, you first have to get over the fact that it contradicts everything you've been taught about making decisions.
<br>
B-school encourages students to frame problems, formulate alternatives, collect data, and then evaluate the options. Almost every
<br>
organization that trains decision-makers has followed the same approach. Paul Van Riper, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general,
<br>
was taught that way, and he drilled this method into his students when he ran the Marines' leadership and combat development program
<br>
in the '90s.
<br>
<p>But Van Riper noticed that in the swirl and confusion of war simulations -- let alone actual combat -- rational decisions always
<br>
seemed to come up short. &quot;We used the classical checklist system,&quot; he says. &quot;But it never seemed to work. Then we'd criticize
<br>
ourselves for not using the system well enough. But it still never seemed to work, because it's the wrong system.&quot; Frustrated, Van
<br>
Riper sought out cognitive psychologist Gary Klein. At the time, Klein was studying firefighters, who operate under conditions quite
<br>
like war. To his consternation, Klein learned that firefighters don't weigh alternatives: They simply grab the first idea that seems
<br>
good enough, then the next, and the next after that. To them it doesn't even feel like &quot;deciding.&quot;
<br>
<p>Inspired by Klein, Van Riper brought a group of Marines to the New York Mercantile Exchange in 1995, because the jostling, confusing
<br>
pits reminded him of war rooms during combat. First the Marines tried their hand at trading on simulators, and to no one's surprise,
<br>
the professionals on the floor wiped them out. A month or so later, the traders went to the Corps's base in Quantico, Va., where
<br>
they played war games against the Marines on a mock battlefield. The traders trounced them again -- and this time everyone was
<br>
surprised.
<br>
<p>When the Marines analyzed the humbling results, they concluded that the traders were simply better gut thinkers. Thoroughly
<br>
practiced at quickly evaluating risks, they were far more willing to act decisively on the kind of imperfect and contradictory
<br>
information that is all you ever get in war. The lesson wasn't lost on the Marines, who concluded that the old rational analysis
<br>
model was useless in some situations. Today the Corps's official doctrine reads, &quot;The intuitive approach is more appropriate for the
<br>
vast majority of ... decisions made in the fluid, rapidly changing conditions of war when time and uncertainty are critical factors,
<br>
and creativity is a desirable trait.&quot; Conditions, in other words, not unlike those in which many business decisions are made today.
<br>
<p>The notion that people always act rationally and in their own interest is a pillar of economic theory. So it's interesting that a
<br>
group of economists, led by the University of Chicago's Richard Thaler, should contribute some of the most damning evidence of
<br>
people's proclivity for irrational decisions. Building on work by Princeton psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, these
<br>
so-called behavioral economists have shown not only that many of our economic decisions are irrational, but also that our
<br>
waywardness is predictable. We get more satisfaction from avoiding a $100 loss than from making a $100 gain, for example, and we
<br>
compulsively find patterns where none exist. (This stock has gone up for three days; therefore it will continue to go up.) Go ahead,
<br>
point it out to us. It doesn't matter; we'll make the same mistakes over and over again.
<br>
<p>Thaler and others speculate that these logical lacunae are the product of a brain wired for survival on the savanna, not for
<br>
hyperrational calculation. Machines do deductive and inductive calculations well. People excel at &quot;abduction,&quot; which is less like
<br>
reason than inspired guesswork. (Deduction: All taxis are yellow; this is a taxi; therefore it is yellow. Induction: These are all
<br>
taxis; these are all yellow; therefore, all taxis are probably yellow. Abduction: All taxis are yellow; this vehicle is yellow;
<br>
therefore this is probably a taxi.) Abduction leaps to conclusions by connecting a known pattern (taxis are yellow) to a specific
<br>
situation (this yellow vehicle must be a taxi). Compared with computers, people are lousy number crunchers but superb pattern
<br>
makers -- even without being aware of it. Indeed, much of what we call instinct, psychologists say, is simply pattern recognition
<br>
taking place at a subconscious level.
<br>
<p>Some tantalizing evidence in this regard comes from experiments by Antonio Damasio, head of neurology at the University of Iowa
<br>
Carver College of Medicine. In one experiment, Damasio gave subjects four decks of cards. They were asked to flip the cards, picking
<br>
from any deck. Two decks were rigged to produce an overall loss (in play money), and two to produce a gain. At intervals, the
<br>
participants were asked what they thought was going on in the game. And they were hooked up to sensors to measure skin conductance
<br>
responses, or SCRs (which are also measured by lie-detector machines).
<br>
<p>By the time they'd turned about 10 cards, subjects began showing SCRs when they reached for a losing deck -- that is, they showed a
<br>
physical reaction. But not until they had turned, on average, 50 cards could they verbalize their &quot;hunch&quot; that two decks were
<br>
riskier. It took 30 more cards before they could explain why their hunch was right. Three players were never able to put their
<br>
hunches into words -- yet they, too, showed elevated SCRs and they, too, picked the right decks. Even if they couldn't explain it,
<br>
their bodies knew what was going on.
<br>
<p>Damasio was already aware of the astounding fact that people who suffer damage to parts of their brains where emotions are processed
<br>
have difficulty making decisions. When such patients participated in Damasio's card experiment, they never expressed hunches.
<br>
Remarkably, even if they figured out the game intellectually, they continued to pick from losing decks. In other words, they knew
<br>
their behavior was a mistake but they couldn't make the decision to change it. Emotions, Damasio theorizes, get decision-making
<br>
started, presenting the conscious, logical mind with a short list of possibilities. Without at least a little intuition, then, the
<br>
decision process never leaves the gate.
<br>
<p>None of us have the advantage of a handy SCR detector to know when we're getting a hunch. But gut knowledge has other ways of making
<br>
its presence felt, and it's often physical. Howard Schultz shook when he had his caffe epiphany. George Soros, the international
<br>
financier who made billions in currency speculation, feels opportunity in his back, according to his son Robert. &quot;The reason he
<br>
changes his position on the market or whatever is because his back starts killing him,&quot; Robert said in a book about his father. &quot;It
<br>
has nothing to do with reason. He literally goes into a spasm, and it's his early warning sign.&quot;
<br>
<p>What exactly is Soros's back reacting to? That question bedeviled Flavia Cymbalista, an economist who specializes in uncertainty in
<br>
financial markets. Soros invests only when he has a hypothesis -- a story that explains a trend in the market. But as Soros himself
<br>
has theorized, markets don't yield to analysis, because they are continuously changing -- and this is one reason Soros has learned
<br>
to trust his back. &quot;There are things you can know, but only experientially and bodily,&quot; Cymbalista says.
<br>
<p>What does this mean for making decisions in real life? Research suggests that neither nose-in-the-spreadsheet rationality nor pure
<br>
gut inspiration is right all the time. The best approach lies somewhere between the extremes, the exact point depending on the
<br>
situation. Naresh Khatri and H. Alvin Ng, of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and Massey University in Wellington, New
<br>
Zealand, surveyed nearly 300 executives in the computer, banking, and utilities industries -- meant to represent three different
<br>
degrees of business stability -- and then compared what executives said about their own decision-making styles. Intuition was
<br>
clearly the favored strategy for computer-industry execs. Planful approaches were the norm in the relatively staid, rules-driven
<br>
utilities industry.
<br>
<p>In a similar vein, Dave Snowden, director of IBM's new Cynefin Centre for Organisational Complexity in Wales, suggests basing your
<br>
approach on the nature of the problem confronting you. Snowden breaks problems down into four types:
<br>
<p>The problem is covered by rules. This is the domain of legal structures, standard operating procedures, practices that are proven to
<br>
work. Never draw to an inside straight. Never lend to a client whose monthly payments exceed 35 percent of gross income. Never end
<br>
the meeting without asking for the sale. Here, decision-making lies squarely in the realm of reason: Find the proper rule and apply
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>The situation is complicated. Here it is possible to work rationally toward a decision, but doing so requires refined judgment and
<br>
expertise. Building an automobile, for example, is a complicated problem. You can diagram it; you can assemble and disassemble it;
<br>
if you remove a piece, you know the consequences. This is the province of engineers, surgeons, intelligence analysts, lawyers, and
<br>
other experts. Artificial intelligence copes well here: Deep Blue plays chess as if it were a complicated problem, looking at every
<br>
possible sequence of moves.
<br>
<p>The situation is complex. This sort of problem can't be resolved by rational analysis. Too much is unknowable. Complex systems --
<br>
battlefields, markets, ecosystems, corporate cultures -- are impervious to a reductionist, take-it-apart-and-see-how-it-works
<br>
approach because your very actions change the situation in unpredictable ways. &quot;Complexity is coherent only in retrospect,&quot; Snowden
<br>
says. With hindsight, for example, the malevolent lines leading to 9/11 are clear, but it would have taken pure luck to see them
<br>
beforehand.
<br>
<p>The strategy is to look for patterns at every level, Snowden says. Or rather, the idea is to allow patterns to surface and trust
<br>
your gut to recognize them. That's how masters play Go, a game that artificial intelligence can't seem to understand. They don't so
<br>
much analyze a game as contemplate it. When a pattern or behavior emerges, they then reinforce it (if they like it) or disrupt it
<br>
(if not).
<br>
<p>In the realm of complexity, decisions come from the informed gut. Karl Wiig, a consultant who runs the Knowledge Research Institute,
<br>
and Sue Stafford, who heads the philosophy department at Simmons College, saw this in action while designing systems for insurance
<br>
companies. &quot;Insurance underwriting software is good only for simple cases,&quot; Stafford says. Plug in the data -- married white male,
<br>
age 30, driving this and living here -- and get a quote. Hard cases -- the diabetic actuary who skydives and teaches Sunday
<br>
school -- need human underwriters, and the best all do the same thing: Dump the file and spread out the contents. &quot;They need to see
<br>
it all at once,&quot; Stafford says. They don't calculate a decision; they arrive at one.
<br>
<p>The situation is chaotic. Here, too, instinct is better than analysis. The only thing you can do is act. &quot;You impose order,&quot; Snowden
<br>
says. &quot;That's where charismatic leaders come in.&quot; After Enron imploded, a team of crisis executives from Kroll Zolfo Cooper
<br>
parachuted in to save what's savable and dismantle the rest in an orderly way. One of them, Michael France, has the job of putting
<br>
together a business plan for OpCo, a possibly viable energy business.
<br>
<p>When he landed, the entire operation was in chaos. &quot;People were afraid,&quot; France recalls. &quot;They were either misdirected or
<br>
undirected. Decision-making was paralyzed. You don't have much time. You've got to be quick and decisive -- make little steps you
<br>
know will succeed, so you can begin to tell a story that makes sense.&quot; This quick-twitch sort of decision-making is akin to the
<br>
firefighter whose gut makes him turn left or the trader who instinctively sells when the news about the stock seems too good to be
<br>
true.
<br>
<p>Behind many of the errors in decision-making lies a yearning for the &quot;right&quot; answer: If only we get enough data, if only we examine
<br>
all the alternatives, we'll know what to do. &quot;People tend to spend all their time looking for rules,&quot; Snowden says. &quot;They're kidding
<br>
themselves.&quot; Situations in which rules supply all the answers are becoming an endangered species, in business and everywhere else.
<br>
Command-and-control management went out with tail fins. Risks are both greater and less predictable. As companies outsource,
<br>
globalize, and form alliances, they become more interdependent -- simultaneously competitor and customer, drastically increasing the
<br>
complexity of their relationships. More and more, all you can do is admit that you simply don't know and go with your gut.
<br>
<p>This may well feel uncomfortable. No one likes uncertainty, and it's going to be hard to explain to your boss a hunch you can't
<br>
really articulate, even to yourself. To make things easier, you can teach yourself to tune in more attentively to intuition and to
<br>
raise your gut IQ. (See &quot;Getting in Touch With Your Gut.&quot;) On the other hand, making decisions this way may come more easily than
<br>
you think. Chances are that the classic linear model you thought you were following -- data comes in, you analyze, draw inferences,
<br>
make a decision -- was partly an illusion anyway. &quot;The data doesn't just 'come in,'&quot; Klein points out. &quot;You have to figure out where
<br>
you're going to look -- and that is an intuitive process.&quot; In other words, you already are more of an intuitive decision-maker than
<br>
you may have thought. So relax and listen. Your gut has something to say to you, and it might be important.
