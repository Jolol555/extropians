</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm with Simons on this one.  Ever since the term
<br>
&quot;junk dna&quot; gained currency, I've wondered why someone
<br>
hasn't challenged the notion.  Breathtakingly arrogant
<br>
if you ask me.  Just because someone came up with the
<br>
idea and coined the phrase, hardly makes it true.  Can
<br>
it really be said--having barely embarked on the
<br>
journey of discovery-- that we know enough about the
<br>
function of dna to declare the apparent 'excess' to be
<br>
junk.  This is way way over the top presumptuous.
<br>
<p>Nature 'believes' in efficiency.  Fitness and
<br>
efficiency go hand in hand.  It took an awful lot of
<br>
energy to make all that 'junk'.  Another organism
<br>
looking to compete for a given niche would have a
<br>
serious advantage when not burdened by the need to
<br>
synthesize and carry around all that 'junk'.  I'm not
<br>
buyin' it.
<br>
<p>My money's on Occam's razor.  The simplest--and
<br>
glaring-- explanation by far is human ignorance and
<br>
overreaching.  The utility of the 'extra' dna awaits
<br>
the gradual elaboration of the grand scheme.  
<br>
<p>I've heard tell that for birds, evolution winnowed the
<br>
cargo of dna, the better for the birdies to get and
<br>
stay airborne.  Or so the theory goes.  If indeed
<br>
evolution trimmed their dna, then we have a proof of
<br>
principle re dna trimming for fitness purposes.  The
<br>
profligate and wasteful production of 'junk' dna
<br>
similarly seems an idea too heavily freighted to get
<br>
off the ground.
<br>
<p>I don't have much in the way of fact here, to back up
<br>
my objection, so shoot me down if you will.
<br>
<p>Some time ago, when I first got annoyed at the seeming
<br>
presumptuousness of the 'junk' dna concept, I wondered
<br>
if perhaps the 'junk' might be preferentially
<br>
distributed in the outer layers of the nuclear
<br>
package, providing a 'shield' for the really vital
<br>
'inner' bits.  You know.  Whatever nasty dna-degrading
<br>
agencies--free radicals, mutagenic compounds, ionizing
<br>
radiation--runnin' around loose in the cytosol, would
<br>
have to get past the protective/sacrificial outer
<br>
layers before thay could do any 'real' damage.  Just
<br>
an idea.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;When I am working on a problem I never think about
<br>
beauty. I only think about how to solve the problem.
<br>
But when I have finished, if the solution is not
<br>
beautiful, I know it is wrong.&quot;
