<em>&gt;Of course not.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your argument, but I thought

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Second, we can see if you'd choose to get it when they are briefly and

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm claiming, against this: &quot;But it wouldn't, in fact, make them happy.
</em><br>
<p>The question was about the choice between power/status and doing good for
<br>
the tribe.  We have been assuming that typically when faced with this choice
<br>
people fool themselves into thinking they are actually doing good for the
<br>
tribe.  We have been asking if this is what they &quot;really want&quot;, and I
<br>
proposed considering two standard ways to define what we &quot;want.&quot;  I claim
<br>
that people are happier in the situations where they get power/status,
<br>
relative to the situations where the tribe has been done good to, in part
<br>
because they can fool themselves into thinking they are doing good by
<br>
getting power/status.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Your argument is that we're self-decieved: we are &quot;really&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;untrustworthy, in the sense that we &quot;really&quot; want things that no one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trust us if they knew we wanted them (and that we would act to get them).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You follow that up with the claim that if individuals become honest to and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with themselves, they'll suffer serious consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Any plausible normative corollary to this claim would require that either:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1 we should cast off our &quot;self-deception&quot; and be honest to ourselves, come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what may, accepting that we all really want terrible things and that no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one should be trusted in the ways that they've been pressured to claim, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2 we shouldn't believe the truth, as you argued in an earlier thread.
</em><br>
<p>I have so far avoided making any moral claims; I have just been making claims
<br>
about what people &quot;really want&quot;.  It is not morally required to give people
<br>
what they really want, and there is no guarantee that what people really
<br>
want is to be moral.  I do personally find it plausible that the moral
<br>
thing to do is to be honest, come what may.  But I don't see much of a
<br>
basis to argue for that position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As you may recall, I argued that 2 was self-contradictory in the &quot;Should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we believe the truth&quot; thread: the short version of that argument was that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it was contrary to 2's own normative principles to believe that it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true.  So, if it were true, we shouldn't believe it: it would be its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first casualty.  I claimed further that 2 was in violation of normative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logic: that, rather, the truth is what we should believe.  (This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because I shouldn't believe that &quot;there is some X such that X is true but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I shouldn't believe X.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>You have generalized your 2 far more than need be.  One might instead claim
<br>
that we shouldn't believe certain particular truths.  That claim would not
<br>
be self-contradictory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... being anti-realistic about the set of desires D, those which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the economist seems to find that we have, allows us to act correctly on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the economic data without believing anything that would lead us to have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept 1 or 2.  We can say, without contradiction, that the economist has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found a set of things that might be called desires but aren't &quot;really&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what we desire at all.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me you are going through these contortions for the mere purpose
<br>
of being able at the end to say that we really want to be moral.  Sure, you
<br>
say, in the ordinary sense of want we don't want to be moral, but in this
<br>
new spiffy philosophical sense of want, that we just invented for this
<br>
purpose, we do want to be moral.  Why not just accept that people don't want
<br>
to be moral?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... the economist's input ends when he tells us which theory is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best economic theory; the philosopher's job begins precisely when we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deciding whether the best economic theory is &quot;real&quot; or just &quot;useful&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think I follow you here, but it seems irrelevant to me; if need
<br>
be I'll just put on my philosopher's hat and claim to be in both roles.
