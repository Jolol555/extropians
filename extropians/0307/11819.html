</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>A decade of &quot;goodness&quot; is probably a significant gain in many people's eyes,
<br>
maybe worth carrying the coaster afterwards. It's kind of like saying I can
<br>
work hard for a decade and get rich, then retire.
<br>
<p>It also reminds me a LOT of university degrees.. work hard for a few years,
<br>
get a degree, never think again. (As an aside, I am really surprised that no
<br>
one makes you re-prove your worthiness for degreed status every so often.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So one has the problem that one selects based on high ratings that are

</em><br>

<p>Sure, it goes like this:
<br>
<p>1. Kill everyone
<br>
2. Let google sort 'em out.
<br>
<p>Anything more complex than this is all chicken entrails.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Would it be ok

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm inclined to think that this shouldn't be a problem.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the first few years (when &quot;natural&quot; behaviors) were in effect yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as soon as people figured out how to milk the system the &quot;ratings&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be of questionable value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is where you need a free market effect to step in; if one system of
<br>
ratings sucks, then others should crop up; the good, bad and ugly. May the
<br>
best system win, until it loses to another one. Personally, I think no-one
<br>
could effectively judge the long term effects of each candidate system, so
<br>
the choice would come down to all the usual crap that we choose from;
<br>
credibility of the system purveyors, market penetration, glossiness of the
<br>
pamphlets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is interesting -- such an approach might produce group 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (tribe) supportive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors (above the average level) for a limited period of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time -- that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be of net benefit to society for some period -- but one has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to wonder about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether there might be a net downside once the cat is out of the bag.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g. &quot;You mean you manipulated me into being a better person than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would otherwise naturally be -- how could you do that?&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; R.
</em><br>
<p>As long as the system of ethics required isn't fixed, it would probably be a
<br>
good thing overall. Once you've released the concept to the market, then it
<br>
just becomes another facet of the market environment; a preference for
<br>
ethical investment over non-ethical, with the preference probably being the
<br>
most common ethical standard amongst all coexistent standards at any time.
<br>
Things like &quot;Don't murder people&quot; become defacto absolute morality, whereas
<br>
&quot;Don't abort fetuses&quot; or &quot;Don't genetically modify organisms&quot; would carry
<br>
far less weight.
<br>
<p>However, a system of ethical investment kicked off by the churches is very
<br>
unlikely, imo, to devolve easily into a system of DIY Ethics. The churches
<br>
would have first mover's advantage, which you would see reflected in the
<br>
infrastructure; the systems of ratings are likely, for example, to come from
<br>
church sources, initially, and to handle a fixed moral code (commandments x
<br>
10 etc). Software to support ethical investment is likely to reflect those
<br>
early assumptions too. Also, and crucially, the churches suddenly have the
<br>
power of the big retirement funds, or other massive investors; how they
<br>
direct investment, in many cases, would control prices. So investing along
<br>
the lines that they invest becomes the right thing to do, purely from a
<br>
profit orientation.
<br>
<p>Probably you'd need government intervention, establishing an Office of Moral
<br>
Competition, requiring that large churches not crush the smaller ones with
<br>
their massive market power. It could levy enormous fines for collusion
<br>
between the Catholics and the Protestants if they conspired to disadvantage
<br>
the Muslims (eg: maybe it would be found that they were telling their
<br>
followers not to invest in oil). 
<br>
<p>They might even force the Catholics to break up into smaller sub-religions.
<br>
Here's a question for those better versed in religion than moi: in what way
<br>
do you break up the Catholics for anti-competitive morality? What are the
<br>
new religious organisations? :-)
