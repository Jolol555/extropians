<p>In other words, you would be willing to act on behalf of children (among

constitutes imprisonment, in your view?
<br>
<p>### Being prevented from leaving the private property of a person, either
<br>
physically or by a threat of force, or in special cases by withholding of

information.

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understand.  I think.  As you yourself have said that you are
<br>
willing to act on behalf of children who have been wronged, would you
<br>
mind if I put your name on my web site as a resource for wronged ten
<br>
year olds?  (It is a fact that many parents make incorrect decisions
<br>
regarding the freedoms of their ten year olds.)
<br>
<p>### I would refer them to the appropriate child protection agencies to which
<br>
I am financially contributing.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>I'm sure that however generous you may be with your own time, you
<br>
would prefer the establishment of a more objective agency, perhaps
<br>
international in scope.  Quite a number of teenagers have been
<br>
denied all the freedoms we customarily enjoy, among them freedom
<br>
of association, free movement, and freedom of speech (the latter
<br>
called, prejudicially, &quot;mouthing off&quot; by their parents).  Do you
<br>
envision a web site where the children can take their complaints,
<br>
and a ruling board that would decide whether intervention against
<br>
the parents will be undertaken?
<br>
<p>### Yes, this would be a good idea. Children dissatisfied with their parents
<br>
must be afforded the same freedom as e.g. employees dissatisfied with their
<br>
employers, or adults dissatisfied with their spouses - the freedom to leave.
<br>
Children wishing to contract for help in dealing with their oppressors must
<br>
be able to contract for protection with agents of their choice. If they
<br>
choose a &quot;ruling board&quot; (what a sinister name), more power to them. It is
<br>
however important to note that no legal &quot;intervention against the parents&quot;
<br>
can be undertaken, unless there is court-admissible evidence of battery,
<br>
fraud, theft, embezzlement, or other common law crimes committed against the
<br>
child. In the absence of such evidence, children, as all humans, may only
<br>
insist on the protection of their freedom and property from encroachment by
<br>
others, rather than retributive justice.
