<em>&gt; Is that why we did that?  I was wondering.
</em><br>
<p>Specifically, I made the mistake of encouraging people to take arguments
<br>
off-list to the moderator as the list rules require.  Unfortunately, I
<br>
didn't realize that we no longer had a moderator and that the list rules
<br>
were not being enforced or followed.  Trying to follow the list rules
<br>
made things worse as people tried to make official complaints with
<br>
nobody to accept them.  As far as I know, none of the complaints were
<br>
ever addressed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Curious, tho, we have had several flamefests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way worse than the one that broke out in May
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and June.  I need to check it however, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was having a lot of computer problems then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and much of my email was being automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deleted, so I mighta missed it.
</em><br>
<p>This latest one was a lot more personal and spilled over into the real
<br>
world.  I am not going to rehash it or go into details again.  However,
<br>
previous flame-wars were more about people's ideas or actions on the
<br>
list.  The latest flame-wars included accusations of real-world
<br>
activities off-list regarding suspected support of different sides of
<br>
the War on Iraq.  There also were vague accusations against ExI as an
<br>
organization and against its officers for some sort of ill-defined
<br>
political misconduct.  We also saw reports of off-list discussions,
<br>
rumors and activities beyond the on-list discussion.  We have never seen
<br>
this level of coordination before, with this number of concurrent
<br>
targets, nor this amount of off-list activity before.  This truly was
<br>
something new for our list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the flamewar was it, but it might just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the times.  Dynamic and practical optimism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been more difficult in the last couple years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has it not?
</em><br>
<p>The real-world problems have been over the last few years.  The list
<br>
problems  have just occurred in the last few months.  Also, other
<br>
transhumanist lists are not facing the same problem even though they
<br>
consist of similar people in a similar world.
