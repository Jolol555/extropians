<em>&gt; there are 10 copies of yourself rather than 1 actually impacts in any

</em><br>
<p>### Maybe it does. Say, if there is an infinite number of distinct
<br>
trajectories that a mind can follow in its development - not the number of
<br>
distinct states that the mind can have, at present, which might be finite,
<br>
but the possibilities for growth in various ways, which should be infinite,
<br>
then increasing the measure of your instantiations in the multiverse (having
<br>
a trillion copies per hubble volume, if you make it to the interstellar
<br>
diaspora by cryonics, rather than one - if you decide not to bother), could
<br>
increase the number of the trajectories you can follow at any point in the
<br>
history of the universe. You can still achieve an infinite number of futures
<br>
if you are re-formed again at a later stage of the universe's history (e.g.
<br>
in a simulation, billions of years later) but you are missing a lot of
<br>
trajectories possible at the same time (sorry for the fuzzy use of the
<br>
concept of time and simultaneity). An infinity does not equal infinity.
<br>
<p>Imagine an ever-growing disc, built by a cellular automaton from a point
<br>
origin. It's border is present, and it is also the only place where
<br>
consciousness of any kind is possible in this system. At some time point r
<br>
in the calculation you exist in a few locations (2pi*r)on the border.
<br>
Assuming that the frequency of you per unit of circle length remains the
<br>
same, at time point r + y there will be 2pi(r+y) of you. There will be also
<br>
trajectories derived from you and your interactions with the local
<br>
environments, different at every location. If you decided to die at r in
<br>
most locations, then you would miss most of the trajectories. You could
<br>
experience them if you wait long enough (r + x) and the local environments
<br>
from r are again recreated (the automaton has a partially recursive
<br>
structure), but by then there are even more trajectories than there were at
<br>
r + y, and you will never catch up with the guy who wanted to live right
<br>
from the start.
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to unpleasant consequences, that seems like a rather sad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment-avoidance motivation, unworthy of a rational being. Exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you are scared to not. Yuck.
</em><br>
<p>### I wouldn't say I am scared of non-existence, but rather eager to exist.
<br>
The unpleasant consequence is not death, but loss of life.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arguments about striving to survive because we evolved to (as brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up by Brett), are explanatory, but not sufficient for justification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the light of a philosophy (transhumanism) which rejects the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints of naturally selected mental structures. Wanting life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we evolved to want it isn't really good enough. Is there a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better reason?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### I think there is no good (i.e. transcendentally valid, universally
<br>
right, one and only proper) reason to live. But, since there is no power in
<br>
me that would counteract my desire to live, I choose to live. I don't see
<br>
the fact that all my desires are just computations on a protein computer
<br>
which evolved to survive, as an external imposition. I wouldn't say that
<br>
transhumanism rejects naturally evolved mental structures merely because
<br>
they are natural - to reject something, it has to be no longer fitting in
<br>
with the rest of accepted mental structures. If it still works, feels
<br>
coherent, then I can keep it. I am, I identify, I accept this evolutionary
<br>
process as a part of self. My self wants to live. This is all the
<br>
justification for living that I need.
