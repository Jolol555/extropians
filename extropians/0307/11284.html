<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Human nature being what it is not all the recommendations for

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; employee cuts will be motivated by the higher good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; With almost superhuman effort, I refrain from the requisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sarcastic comment here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You lost me Lee. Where are you going?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry Brett.  The requisite sarcastic comment would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Oh really?  Are you telling me that some of the employee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cuts might be for base motives?  Surely you cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious!&quot;, or similar words to convey my cynicism.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough. The tone was missing and sometimes, to your
<br>
credit, (no sarcasm at all) you question the bleedin' obvious
<br>
just as I do, and soetimes the bleedin; obvious turns out to 
<br>
be not so obvious after all.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some will want to settle old scores, remove competitors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use the opportunities in the restructure to alter their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; competitive position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Say it's not so!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (After all, I'm only human.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In some cases it *is* so. (Double sarcasm if you like ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, DUH, of COURSE it's so! 
</em><br>
<p>Triple sarcasm with a redundant DOH ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *You* asked the question!? What gives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was a rhetorical question---that is, when I said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;what possible incentive would government (or government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employees, etc.) ever have to cut spending?&quot;, I was just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that they do not have incentives to cut spending.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sorry that you took it so literally; that is not how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was meant.
</em><br>
<p>Ah but in some cases they do. We agree now I presume, if
<br>
we ever really disagree that being a member of the government
<br>
employee class is insufficient to give us full insight into the 
<br>
motives of each particualar instance in that classs whilst they 
<br>
are also members of other classes with other calls on their
<br>
loyalty.
<br>
<p>Probably I push these things into the area of the bleedin 
<br>
obvious sometimes because a *series* of obvious steps often
<br>
gets one to a not so obvious conclusion. Sometimes finer
<br>
grained explanations are useful. Sometimes not.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well I'm not quite that cynical. People's positive views 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of themselves are something they sometimes want to retain too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, yes, but see Robin's recent comments on &quot;views&quot; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a person.  People also will want positive views of themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too, but often foment the most amazingly self-delusional beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Yep but I think the desire to reduce cognitive dissonance is still
<br>
there. Actually Robin's thesis reminds me of Glaucon's question
<br>
to Socrates in the republic. I paraphasing. &quot;Why would people
<br>
want to do what is generally regarded as righteous and nobel
<br>
as opposed to merely being perceived as doing what is 
<br>
righteous and nobel and actually doing whatever they damn 
<br>
well please.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Oops, sorry, I know what you think about &quot;beliefs&quot;, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is late and I am too tired to reword that.
</em><br>
<p>I know what you mean. You know what I mean. The beliefs
<br>
thing is another discussion for another day. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There probably is such a thing as someone wanting to do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; real public service all things being equal. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyway I thought *you* were the one that believed in altruism. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but the kind of altruism that we are evolved for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not at all related to the kind of decisions bureaucrats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make.  We are evolved to feel sympathy for individual other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.
</em><br>
<p>Sympathy or empathy. Your a rational sort of specimen Lee, I
<br>
figure I am too. We can't both be using altruism with the same
<br>
referent you holding that it is true and me holding that it is 
<br>
not (or actually I hold that I don't believe in it - which is not quite
<br>
the same thing).
<br>
<p>What's your case for altruism. You may be able to convert me.
<br>
Stick in a link or ref if you don't want to reinvent the wheel.
<br>
<p>I don't think these discussions are merely academic. 
<br>
<p>I suspect that there are core attributes, universals if you like
<br>
of 'human nature' that almost all of us subscribe to. 
<br>
<p>Having a good handle on these would be very useful. We 
<br>
may define a set of median interests that more people can 
<br>
get behind. Currently ethics seem to be on appallingly 
<br>
poor rational ground. 
<br>
<p>I'd start with the propositions that human beings have
<br>
1) a propensity to sociability (not unlimited)
<br>
2) a propensity to rationality (not unlimited)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to these we have a capacity for language.
<br>
<p>3) We develop biologically so our capacities and even 
<br>
our conceptions of ourselves as conscious selves emerge
<br>
over time. There are some cognitive steps we cannot 
<br>
jump.
<br>
<p>Are there any other fundamentals? Are these too many?
<br>
<p>I think I'd throw in a thesis that life, one's own life
<br>
is one's first (original not necessarily highest) value.
<br>
<p>Dead things value nothing. Some people will sacrifice
<br>
their lives for what seems to me to be their self
<br>
concept. Ghandi perhaps. But the key word is perhaps
<br>
still *their* self concept.
<br>
<p>My point is we (scientists, humanists) may be able to take
<br>
these basic &quot;truths&quot; of human nature and put ethics on 
<br>
a stronger footing. Game Theory, tit for tat etc are a
<br>
start but I reckon we can go further. 
<br>
<p>I am not yet ready to surrender to Bertrand Russell's
<br>
notion that what is ethical can amount to no more than
<br>
what I like, or in your case what you like. I think we
<br>
can attack the thesis with some of the other aspects of
<br>
human nature but I don't think we need altruism. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
