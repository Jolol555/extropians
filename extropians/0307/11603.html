<p><em>&gt; As I see it the word life should not be interpreted narrowly and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parochially as our particular kind of water-protein organisation but as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex self-replicating and evolving systems as a whole.... And these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms of life are equally worth our reverence and appreciation as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional wet kind. There is no fundamental difference between created 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and born life, except possibly that the former has a morally responsible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .parent.. 
</em><br>
<p>Sounds quite right, except for the lack of stress on &quot;experience&quot;.
<br>
<p>In your fine essay, you speak often of valuing life for its own sake,
<br>
and---if we are to compare it to emptiness or dead matter---I agree
<br>
fully and absolutely.  But of what value is ordinary life when
<br>
compared to life which can host subjective experience?
<br>
<p>The main point to life, so far as I can see, is to generate living
<br>
experience.  That is, unless there are entities around to *enjoy*
<br>
existing, it's not of much use.
<br>
<p>As progressive and avant garde as your essay is in our world today,
<br>
this is the extropians list, and I would like you to criticize a
<br>
parallel vision.  It is an emotionally unappealing view, at least
<br>
when considered visually, as I readily admit.  This vision consists
<br>
of nothing but matter throughout the solar system being turned into
<br>
ugly silicon, or silicon-like matter capable of processing information.
<br>
All other forms of existence would yield, and be replaced by whatever
<br>
computronium-like substance we can engineer to provide the greatest
<br>
possible amount of positive experience for the greatest possible
<br>
number of sentient entities.
<br>
<p>I will not attempt the necessary paragraphs to communicate the
<br>
vastness of the complexity, joy, richness, fulfillment, and 
<br>
satisfaction that this image rightfully possesses, and devolves
<br>
onto sextillions of entities or their equivalent.  But I would
<br>
hope that the happiness of matter is not sacrificed for traditional
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; concerns, e.g., conventional ecosystems, which can hardly
<br>
be said to enjoy life all that much.
<br>
<p>(Of course, there are many problems: what if a provision for one
<br>
&quot;utility monster&quot; in some manner provides matter with more and
<br>
higher quality experience than providing for trillions of lesser
<br>
entities?  Just how our allegiance to freedom and to private property
<br>
evolution will cause all this to turn out is surely not foreseeable.
<br>
But that's all right IMO;  we can hardly wish to impose any kind of
<br>
top down global solution.  I would hope that the owners of matter will
<br>
simply work towards using it to maximize positive experience for entities,
<br>
that's all, regardless of how many natural environments, trees, or
<br>
beetles are sacrificed in the process.)
