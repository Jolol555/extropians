<em>&gt; Journeys of self-discovery are familiar themes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature and in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories people tell about themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Because journeys themselves are a standard literary
<br>
device.  It is easier to describe and relate physical
<br>
changes, especially in ways that capture the
<br>
audience's attention, than purely mental ones.  &quot;Jane
<br>
sat around all day, thinking about the difference
<br>
between herself and mermaids, and realized that they
<br>
were just two different types of people after all,&quot; is
<br>
not as exciting as, &quot;Jane donned her scuba gear and
<br>
set off for the mermaid colony, enraptured by every
<br>
quirk of difference she saw, until she noticed that,
<br>
despite the fins and gills and aquatic cities,
<br>
mermaids were just people too.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why couldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution have let people better see their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences?  Now it isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crazy to think that our preferences are encoded in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such complex and kludgey 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental modules that our conscious mind must struggle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to infer their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contents from lots of specific decisions.  But even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so it seems odd that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now seem to know more about the (really quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strange) nature of the atom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than we do about what the typical person really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants.  Why were not our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestors able to slowly learn what they wanted, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then use language to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass that knowledge on to succeeding generations?
</em><br>
<p>Because the human brain is far more complex than, and
<br>
not as easy to objectively observe as, an atom?
<br>
<p>Consider: Boolean logic, having few practical uses
<br>
before the invention of the computer (a tool with
<br>
which to implement its predictions), did not receive
<br>
as much study before that time as since.  Likewise, we
<br>
have been lacking in tools to observe mental states -
<br>
beyond notoriously subjective observations of actions
<br>
that said states trigger, with often unreliable
<br>
connections back to said states - until the past
<br>
century or so.
