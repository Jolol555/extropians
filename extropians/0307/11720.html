<p><em>&gt; In the spirit of getting things done, here is the low-cost organizational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution to this particular problem:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Someone becomes Grand Keeper of Extropian Secrets. Democratic process and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatnot not really required; duties are not onerous. Should be someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible and reliable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The GFES gets a mission statement/miniFAQ/resource list written. Two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pages should do it. This is posted to the list once a month. I refer to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the CR list at www.calorierestriction.org for a truly excellent example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this sort of thing. The purpose of this thing is a) to help the newcomers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find context, b) to help the oldtimers remember the context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) The GFES finds out what people are doing. I mean *doing*. Like I run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; www.longevitymeme.org. There are at least twenty or so other transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; webmasters I know of who can be said to be *doing* things. Mike has the Free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State Project, there are WTA cells all over the place, people organizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conferences, two or three nanotech advocacy groups, some of us are even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuring out the internals of the human body or building better rockets. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean, there's a lot going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The list of *doing* gets formalized and posted once a month. With contact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, brief project descriptions, and How To Help paragraphs. As it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progresses and shows value, the GFES stops having to prod people, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they come to the GFES with their updates.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds great to me.  One great asset of such an initiative is that there
<br>
are many (such as myself) who are spearheading key aspects of the futurist
<br>
agenda but to whom reading high-bandwidth lists is a major time sink that
<br>
competes with our (presumably valuable) main occupation.  Replying to
<br>
questions that are directed to me personally (and copied to a list if the
<br>
questioner chooses) is a much more efficient approach that I never shirk
<br>
from, and I bet numerous others in my position feel the same.  Having my
<br>
name/website/activities on such a list would thus be a move in the right
<br>
direction from my point of view.

(who is curious what the word beginning with &quot;F&quot; that was replaced by
<br>
&quot;Keeper&quot; was...)
