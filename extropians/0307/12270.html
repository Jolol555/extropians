<p>
So, states have special &quot;rights&quot; that people somehow
<br>
do not?  Well, at least it's a consistent position. 
<br>
States define whatever &quot;rights&quot; exist by virtue of
<br>
having more guns than mere citizens.  I get that.  OK,
<br>
&quot;Rights&quot; then are merely whatever is legal.  I.e.,
<br>
Jews had no right to exist in NAZI Germany, just as
<br>
our heroic* drug dealers have no similar &quot;right&quot; to
<br>
exist in the U.S. (or anywhere on Earth, in as much as
<br>
the U.S. has now given itself the &quot;right&quot; to hunt them
<br>
down and kill them anywhere in the universe).  
<br>
<p>*Hey, if Ms. Lynch can be a hero for passing out and
<br>
being rescued, then a drug dealer, who takes huge
<br>
actual risks to deliver products to eager consumers,
<br>
in spite of armed thugs in uniform expending every
<br>
effort to find and imprison or kill him, certainly 
<br>
qualifies...  Or maybe only if the drug dealer has a
<br>
cute photogenic face?
<br>
<p>So, all we have to have is any ongoing conflict - and
<br>
WHO decides THAT issue - and then we can just dispense
<br>
with all that silly nonsense about juries, due
<br>
process, trials, public tranparency...  I guess Hitler
<br>
had it right with that little fire at the Reichstag,
<br>
huh? This is a libertarian position???  libertarianism
<br>
sure has changed from what I thought it was.
<br>
<p>Now I can certainly understand that if someone is
<br>
pointing an RPG at you, you don't have to read him or
<br>
her his rights before blowing the sucker away. 
<br>
However, the whole point of giving battlefield
<br>
personnel that discretion is that the demands of
<br>
self-preservation require it.  Once you have actually
<br>
subdued and captured the person, then other rules
<br>
apply, including due process, trial by jury, etc.
<br>
<p>And the need to prevent enemy combattants from taking
<br>
advantage in ways that involve non-combattants
<br>
involuntarilly - as in spies pretending to be
<br>
civilians, or using civilians otherwise as human
<br>
shields - still requires a determination that this has
<br>
in fact been the case.  Which means public trial by
<br>
jury, etc.  
<br>
<p>The discretion to kill or otherwise inflict harm on
<br>
any person is limited by the natural requirements of
<br>
the situation.  We all have the natural right to
<br>
defend ourselves from immediate attack.  None of us
<br>
has the right to extend that to killing other people
<br>
after they are safely in custody - except in the very
<br>
limited circumstances of a natural battlefield
<br>
emergency, which, again, is justified by immediate
<br>
need.

<br>
Date: Wed Jul 30 2003: ....  While ANY conflict is
<br>
ongoing, seized enemy combatants, legal or illegal in
<br>
nature, can be held indefinitely. Disposition under
<br>
courts of law is only REQUIRED when a specific
<br>
conflict has ended, but this ONLY applies to LEGAL
<br>
combatants. 
<br>
<p>(Me: And so, once again, somehow some military person
<br>
makes a determination that supercedes and nullifies
<br>
all other rights.  Just declare that person ILLEGAL
<br>
and then you can do whatever you want to them.  Just
<br>
announce that a conflict is ONGOING and you can
<br>
declare anyone ILLEGAL whenever you want.)
<br>
<p>....I am so adamant that illegal combatants should be 
<br>
seen as the worst sort of criminal on earth, because
<br>
they seek to destroy the most important bonds of trust
<br>
that maintain the subservience of military to
<br>
civilian. 
<br>
<p>(Me: my understanding is that we already have cases
<br>
now of American citizens losing their citizenship
<br>
rights BEFORE any trial, just by this same sort of
<br>
declaration - the &quot;American Taliban&quot; being one such
<br>
example.)
<br>
<p>(Me: who would have thought that throwing out a couple
<br>
centuries of supposed Constitutional-based liberty
<br>
would be so simple?)
