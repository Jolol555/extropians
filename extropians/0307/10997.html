<em>&gt; I think you can avoid the contradiction by modifying your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Axiom 1 from &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist (am)&quot; or &quot;I think&quot; to  &quot;Something exists&quot;, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Something thinks&quot;.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think this would serve the intended purpose in the logical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Jef
</em><br>
<p>I could do that, because I am something, and I exist, therefore something
<br>
exists. However, I would still conclude that I am not, and &quot;I am&quot; would
<br>
still be my most basic axiom (I am not free to vary this!), so I would still
<br>
be in the same position.

<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I've been finding continuing thinking on the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness quite unsettling. The problem is as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Axiom: I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (What is this &quot;I&quot; the human speaks of?  We in the hive find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this concept to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be very strange.)
</em><br>
<p>I can't speak for the hive, only for myself. It is my sense of self, of
<br>
continuity; something that no mere algorithm should be able to lay claim to.
<br>
It is being. Fuck, that makes no sense at all. Sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tenuous hypothesis 1: I have sensory input implying other stuff, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so it is too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Tenuous hypothesis 2: I am part of the set of other stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (much deduction, investigation, leading to negation of concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conscious self; self is an illusion, &quot;I&quot; am just a pattern of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find that if I take Tenuous Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 as axioms, I produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the result:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Result: I am not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; By my original axiom, I now have A and ~A. I've just flushed reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down the toilet. What is existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't fault the materialist viewpoint, because I can't support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alternative; the closer I look, the more it appears that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible role at all for any proposed non-physical piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness. So intelligent thought is a purely physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; phenomenon, about information processing. Which means that &quot;I&quot; am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not; &quot;I&quot; am an illusion (fooling who? what?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can only find paradox at the base of any search for an explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the only phenomenon in the universe that I can definitely call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; axiomatic (that I am).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is axiomatic that *something* exists, but not that *I* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist since this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would require defining what what *I* is, and this leads to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that circular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning that's troubling you.
</em><br>
<p>How about this: &quot;I&quot; is that piece of me, as an entity, that experiences. I
<br>
exclude all information processing components from this, although they are
<br>
undoubtedly required to be present. I feel like there is something left over
<br>
that can be termed &quot;I&quot; (and which is somehow pivotal), but I also know that
<br>
that can't be the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no self separate from the rest of the universe.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self is a process that evolved within certain replicating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe due to its utility to the survival and further 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propagation of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns.  The concept of &quot;self&quot; (everything inside) and &quot;not self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (everything outside) is fundamental to virtually all complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote survival and thus propagation of the organism.  No 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder its so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to see.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this material explanation of self makes a lot of sense, yet I can
<br>
imagine a system which fully meets the description, and yet doesn't have
<br>
this visceral, fundamental experience of being.
<br>
<p>I can't explain it any better than this; I'm really hoping that people out
<br>
there know what I'm refering to (or else Solipcism is right after all).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me, it is more clearly evident than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; existence of anything else. But apparently it cannot be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Help.
