</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>NO.  But it is quite appropriate to noise it about that you will defend 
<br>
yourself and your property with deadly force if attacked.  If you &quot;know for a 
<br>
fact&quot; this person has violated community laws then you should present your 
<br>
evidence and have this person carted away if at all possible. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I used to hate people who would not submit simple YES or NO
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It depends on a number of things: firstly, what do I gauge will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this person's reaction to the fact that I have a shotgun and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am inclined to use it on him if he proceeds unjustly with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machete?  Let us suppose that this would sober him up, and moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he's not the type to sneak up on me and kill me later on.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderation seems the best course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is not moderation.  It is simply sane. Blowing him away without 
<br>
sufficient evidence to convict on suspicion is highly unjust and itself 
<br>
criminal and actionable malice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be idiotic IMO to try to place probabilities on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these possibilities or tendencies, so one should have to ponder it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and length, and perhaps talk to others to gain the advantage of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking and experience before making a decision.  Clearly, I ought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go kill him if there is a very large chance he will ambush me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later.  Moreover, since you bring up his past misdeeds, there looms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the large possibility that we should jail or execute this person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, this [ambush likely] scenario is not sufficient reason to kill another 
<br>
human being in a civilized society.   What does talking to a bunch of other 
<br>
people have to do with the clear issues and principles at hand?

<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; This is still not a fair example. How about this one: what if you have a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take over the community well that supplies all the water for irrigation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of crops? Should I go over to your house and blow you away, just in case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should your philosophy make a difference?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, your target's &quot;philosophy&quot; definitely should make a difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you just go over there and show him your shotgun, and muster all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the true determination and decisiveness you actually possess, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to make it clear to him that he can't get his way by threatening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others with his gun, then you *may* be able to tell from his reaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what to do.  I definitely would not go alone however---not for the sake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my personal safety, but for the sake of the impact of numbers, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make my decision to take away his gun, or even to kill him, a group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision of all of the community that is involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should it make a difference if your reason for taking over the well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is to redesign the irrigation system so that it functions more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efficiently?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This definitely depends on how predisposed he is to talk things over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If he has decided upon his plan of action because people are dying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the council is stupid and stubborn, then perhaps both of you---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armed---can talk some sense into the council.  But:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This perfectly well illustrates the paucity of information (necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course, in most written accounts) in your story.  In a real situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's knowledge of all the circumstances would be so much greater.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How about a less complex situation: Suppose there is a bus carrying 45
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innocent passengers. You have reason to believe that the bus driver
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intends to drive the bus through a crowd of pregnant women at a LaLeche
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; League event. To allow the bus to continue on its present course may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result in the deaths of 50 women, 53 fetuses, and 2 bus passengers; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least 120 potential lives will be lost (some of the women killed would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have gotten pregnant and given birth again, after the births of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fetuses they are presently carrying, and several of the bus passengers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are females of child bearing age). Do you  blow up a freeway overpass as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the bus approaches, causing the bus to crash and burn?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You then go on to shade this example with further important particulars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In every case you ask &quot;does it make a difference if...&quot;, and the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is always &quot;yes&quot;.  Our decisions would always be based, IMO, on all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available data.  Only in rare circumstances would I close my ears and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; announce that I was simply going to adhere to some principle.  On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand, in no case would I merely ignore the precious principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handed down to us by our ancestors.
