</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How perfectly awful of you to say that!
</em><br>
<p>But of course.  It was just begging for it; I couldn't resist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the government prints $2,000,000,000 and hands it out, [... then]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the government takes the $2,000,000,000 out of the subsequent tax

<em>&gt; revenue, and burns it.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like you've answered your own question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [...] by &quot;growth&quot; I mean that which takes us towards the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whatever advances the economy in the long run.
</em><br>
<p>Tax cuts stimulate both short term and long term growth.  Tax hikes do
<br>
the same thing, really.  Any external artificial force on the economy
<br>
has the opportunity to stimulate growth.  Nothing is guaranteed, of
<br>
course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A nice generalization, but not always true. What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; times that government projects, usually infrastructure, end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; up creating wealth in the long run?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Like which?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be that the American space program is an example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it's likely that the &quot;American Road&quot; they built 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across the Appalachians in the early 1800's is another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know if the English government were involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (one must say &quot;they&quot;, one knows), but it might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned out to be very sensible to have got behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the canal building over there in the late 1700s.
</em><br>
<p>I'm surprised you didn't lump &quot;the Internet&quot; in there as well.
<br>
<p>Realize that a lot of government projects utilize vendors in the private
<br>
sector.  Even infrastructure-building and other government projects is
<br>
really just a venue for redistributing tax funds back into the economy
<br>
... which is exactly why both tax hikes and tax cuts have similar
<br>
effects.  Of course, since I'm on this side of the fence, I enjoy tax
<br>
cuts more because I'd rather spend the money myself, than let government
<br>
spend it for me.
