<p><em>&gt; However, my questions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   1. when should government print money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   2. when should it reduce taxes *in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      to* stimulate growth&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Dunno. But I think I can knock an edge of the second point
<br>
at least.
<br>
<p>Taxes (in Australian and I imagine in the US) automatically
<br>
increase with inflation through what is known as the pehenomenon
<br>
of bracket creap.
<br>
<p>Tiered tax systems impose different levels of taxation at each
<br>
of the thresholds crossed. Say 29% on income up to 29,999
<br>
32% on income up to 40,000, 38% on income up to 55,000
<br>
etc (the figures are not correct).
<br>
<p>Point is in doing it this way the thresholds don't move up with
<br>
inflation. the purchasing power on 29,999 is less after a year
<br>
of inflation and so all things being equal salaries going up to
<br>
maintain parity with inflation see more income in real (not nominal
<br>
terms get taxed over time). In high inflation environments the
<br>
goverment collects more tax as a consquence of bracket creep.
<br>
<p>So there are two ways of &quot;reducing taxes&quot;. (1) cut spending.
<br>
(2) return the proceeds of bracket creep.
<br>
<p>(2) is a political freebie. Pollies can do it without cutting 
<br>
spending.
<br>
<p>(1) Though is a separate matter. Whether one holds a 
<br>
particular tax cut is going to be stimulatory depends in 
<br>
part on what governement spending is not going to happen.
<br>
<p>Welfare recipients may spend a higher proportion of their
<br>
income than the wealthy. Cutting welfare and dispersing
<br>
the tax breaks not back to the welfare recipients can end
<br>
up in putting the money in the hands of some not on welfare 
<br>
including the wealthy who may be inclined to invest it rather
<br>
than spend it. If it they invest it wisely the net priming 
<br>
effect on the economy may be sufficient to offest the 
<br>
non-near certain spending that would have been made had
<br>
all the tax cuts gone back to the welfare recipients.
<br>
<p>If you want to stimulate business investment there may be
<br>
better ways than tax cuts. But that means the government
<br>
is going into the business of picking winners. Personally I
<br>
think there are some categories of investmen, perhaps 
<br>
increased funding to longer term R&amp;D, or the NIH, where
<br>
the money may well have a greater pump priming effect 
<br>
and also provide financing to sectors that would otherwise
<br>
develop more slowly.
