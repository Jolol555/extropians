<em>&gt; &gt; that is based on ones best judgements made in good 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; concept of morality itself becomes absurd as we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ultimately have no other recourse than to act on our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; judgement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Paul] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ..when acting on knowledge of probabilities in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premptive fashion),  you can't really consider ur reaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral or immoral....
</em><br>
<p>I was not meaning to say, as you seem to be here, that
<br>
acting or anticipating the actions of others (especially 
<br>
when the actions of others are likely to be serious even
<br>
lethal) that one is necessarily operating outside of a 
<br>
moral sphere. Quite to the contrary I was trying, perhaps, 
<br>
not very effectively, to make the point that as subjective
<br>
indivduals *all* of our judgements must necessarily be
<br>
finally self-centric, including our *moral* judgements. 
<br>
<p>Therefore, it follows to me, almost as day must follow
<br>
night, that whatever else one's moral system might 
<br>
incorporate, it *cannot*, (if it is to be consistent and to
<br>
have utility in guiding our actions and serving as a basis
<br>
from which we might seek to form compacts with each
<br>
other) not incorporate the recognition that we must be
<br>
honest with ourselves. I'm arguing that moral action is
<br>
precluded, that one cannot be acting morally if one is
<br>
not acting on one's own best comprehension of the
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>Now against this point it might be argued that there
<br>
are no circumstances where dishonesty with oneself is
<br>
a moral matter. I conceed that this is the traditional view
<br>
but my contention is that that traditional view is wrong,
<br>
flawed, and lacking in utility. 
<br>
<p>I am arguing that only those that can commit themselves
<br>
to hold themselves to a rational moral code are in a 
<br>
position to have the sort of maturity that is required to 
<br>
forge the sort of compacts that will best serve the 
<br>
strongest forms of cooperatives and the most extropic
<br>
societies.
<br>
<p>I do not imagine that any of us ultimately succeeds in
<br>
avoiding self delusion. But if the charge of hyper-rationality
<br>
is ever a valid criticism I do not think it can be so on 
<br>
matters of morality where the individuals concerned 
<br>
acknowledge that their take on the universe is inherently 
<br>
subjective and inherently selfish. It is my contention that
<br>
if we cannot find a harmony of selfish interests we will
<br>
not find anything but the illusion of harmony at all. 
<br>
<p>And in order for their to be a harmony of selfish interests
<br>
their must be real recognition of the nature of oneself 
<br>
and ones needs. This is where I think it becomes important
<br>
to acknowledge to oneself that one can be rational and 
<br>
that one is by nature social. If one does not acknowledge 
<br>
that one is social one is not (by my reckoning) being true
<br>
to oneself and one does not have the sort of maturity 
<br>
that will enable one to be on good terms with oneself
<br>
and to form real compacts that have a chance of being
<br>
honored with others. 
<br>
<p>If there was a creature that by nature was not social in
<br>
any sense I would grant by my notion of morality that
<br>
that creature would have no duties to others and that
<br>
that creature would not be acting immorally in anything
<br>
it did to others.  If one is sure that one is being 
<br>
threatened by a genuine sociopath by my moral reckoning
<br>
one would not only be permitted to act in ones defence
<br>
one would be morally obliged. 
<br>
<p>In practise I would have some residual doubts about
<br>
the completeness of the sociopathy of even a creature
<br>
such as Hitler so I would not feel completely free to 
<br>
exterminate him with extreme prejudice unless I had
<br>
made a good faith reckoning as to the nature of him 
<br>
as a threat to what I value. Then having made a 
<br>
best a rational determination of the nature of the threat
<br>
as I could given the time and context I would feel free
<br>
to exterminate him with exteme prejudice and I 
<br>
would expect to feel no guilt but only some misgivings
<br>
that had I more time I might have judged better. ie.
<br>
My concept of morality is I think in that sense
<br>
practical. And it is extensible. If others share it,
<br>
if they act rationally and in accordance with their selfish
<br>
best interests as they perceive it I can (in the context)
<br>
of this moral system have not fault them morally.  
<br>
<p>[Paul]
<br>
<em>&gt; Pretty much the only time u can consider something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral or immoral is after the event has occurred, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, only for urself.  Morality has absolutely no import
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a pre-emptive doctrine.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree. By my reckoning of morality, when 
<br>
individuals agree to cooperate with each other for their
<br>
mutual advantage (perhaps at some cost to them on
<br>
other dimensions were they reckoning their best
<br>
interests separately) there is a moral bond between
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>I am interested in exploring the notion that all things
<br>
that are reckoned by a person to be in that persons
<br>
rational self-interest 
<br>
<p>[Paul]
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyone that believes to the contrary has not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationally examined the situation.
</em><br>
<p>To be frank, I am doubtful that the word belief can
<br>
be validly coupled (except as crude linguistic 
<br>
shorthand for &quot;this is my operating hypothesis&quot;) with
<br>
a rational examination of  any situation. Belief is often
<br>
used by fairly rational people in just this short hand
<br>
manner. By the code of morality I have tried to
<br>
describe, belief qua belief is immoral. This is because
<br>
when one is believing one is not reasoning and when
<br>
one is not reasoning to the route of ones selfish best
<br>
interest one is groping with a less than optimal method. 
<br>
<p>My contention is that as soon as one becomes
<br>
a &quot;believer&quot; one has ceased to hold to the principle
<br>
of to thine own self be true - unless one is incapable
<br>
of reasoning - (or one must reach a tenatative 
<br>
conclusion based on the imperative to live and
<br>
act in real time). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Generally speaking, I have no use for morality; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just ethics [standard api, consistently adhered to, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logically derived, based on reality]....
</em><br>
<p>I'm reading api as 'application programming interface'. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Generally speaking&quot; I suspect you are unlikely to 
<br>
enjoy discussing morality and/or ethics much further
<br>
with me ;-)
<br>
<p>I may make a real balls up of communicating what 
<br>
I am saying in an interesting way but I have given
<br>
the issue of morality some thought. I think it is an 
<br>
important topic.
