<p>
Journeys of self-discovery are familiar themes in literature and in the 
<br>
stories people tell about themselves.  In such journeys, people learn about 
<br>
their abilities, how they appear to others, and what they really 
<br>
want.  While sometimes people learn a great deal about themselves in a 
<br>
short time, usually self-discovery is considered to take place over years 
<br>
or decades.
<br>
<p>Now it makes sense that it takes a lot of time and varied experiences for 
<br>
people to learn about their abilities and how they appear to others.  But 
<br>
it may seem more surprising that people need so much time and effort to 
<br>
figure out what they want.  While people do tend to know that all else 
<br>
equal they prefer more health, comfort, achievement, approval, status, 
<br>
novelty, sex, children, truth, and so on, people often seem remarkably 
<br>
unsure about the relative weights they put on these things.  Standard 
<br>
stories have people thinking, for example, that they want to achieve some 
<br>
great end, and then learn that they really care more about family and 
<br>
intimacy than they realized.  Or someone might think they want a high 
<br>
status mate, only to discover they care more about loyalty than they realized.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From an evolutionary point of view, it seems odd that it should take so 
<br>
much effort for people to figure out what they want.  Why couldn't 
<br>
evolution have let people better see their own preferences?  Now it isn't 
<br>
crazy to think that our preferences are encoded in such complex and kludgey 
<br>
mental modules that our conscious mind must struggle to infer their 
<br>
contents from lots of specific decisions.  But even so it seems odd that we 
<br>
now seem to know more about the (really quite strange) nature of the atom 
<br>
than we do about what the typical person really wants.  Why were not our 
<br>
ancestors able to slowly learn what they wanted, and then use language to 
<br>
pass that knowledge on to succeeding generations?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that an alternative hypothesis should be entertained: that 
<br>
we are greatly self-deceived about what we want.  Maybe the things we 
<br>
actually want are typically not as noble as the things we want to believe 
<br>
that we want.  Maybe we really want social approval more than we admit, for 
<br>
example.  But believing ourselves to be noble may help us to convince 
<br>
others that we are noble, and so to convince them to associate with 
<br>
us.  Also, we may want to believe that our career/spouse/etc. is just the 
<br>
sort of career or spouse we wanted, so that we can reassure our associates 
<br>
that we are not considering switching careers/spouses/etc.
<br>
<p>This alternative hypothesis suggests that most literary journeys of 
<br>
self-discovery are really aids to self-delusion, helping people tell 
<br>
themselves comforting stories about themselves.  Real journeys of 
<br>
self-discovery would largely be dark affairs, wherein mounting evidence 
<br>
forced people to believe ignoble things about themselves that they would 
<br>
rather not tell others.  And those who do struggle over decades to learn 
<br>
the truth about what people want, and who are willing to tell others, would 
<br>
face largely indifferent or hostile audiences.  Young optimists would have 
<br>
evolved to ignore the claims of old cynics, since the young optimists of 
<br>
the past who did not were less attractive as mates and associates.
<br>
<p>This hypothesis is not optimistic about the prospects for successful wider 
<br>
application of academic psychology and social science.  To the extent that 
<br>
evidence forces academics to see the truth about what people typically 
<br>
want, academics may be marginalized and ignored by the larger society.  And 
<br>
to the extent that academics are responsive to demands from students, 
<br>
donors, and other clients, they may ignore the evidence as long as possible.
<br>
<p>What do women (or men) really want?  Are you sure you want to know?
