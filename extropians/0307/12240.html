<p>
When I was 19, my friend and I discussed the usual sophomore
<br>
questions, &quot;when would you throw a rope to a drowning man?&quot;,
<br>
and &quot;if you would, to how much inconvenience or risk would
<br>
you put yourself?&quot;.
<br>
<p>I found my friend's answer very interesting: he almost always
<br>
said &quot;It's not my responsibility&quot;.  I gathered that he'd
<br>
throw the rope only if he happened to feel like it, or if he
<br>
had done something to cause the desperate person to be in such
<br>
a predicament.  I, on the other hand, was at that age willing
<br>
to assume almost unlimited responsibility.  For me, in all
<br>
cases, it clearly was a clear choice of A or B, and I
<br>
evalutated my preferences as best I could according to abstract
<br>
principles (perhaps admitting, as I have more formally done in
<br>
recent decades, that a separate and important part of my values
<br>
concern what ends up being good for me).
<br>
<p>Today I have drifted far from that original position.  It's rather
<br>
easy to consider imaginary cases in which the answer &quot;That wouldn't
<br>
be my responsibility&quot; comes easily.  There are many more cases
<br>
than previously whereupon I would undertake some action except
<br>
that it would be a burden to feel responsible for the consequences.
<br>
<p>I wonder how general this development is.  Has anyone else here
<br>
experienced similar or contrary personal developments?
<br>
