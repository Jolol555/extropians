<p>The calculation need not be particularly rigorous.  If significant information

is stored structurally and if significant structural damage is a property of 
<br>
current cryonic techniques then it is given that there will likely be too 
<br>
much loss of significant information.

<p>No, I don't think you can.  What are to use to &quot;connect the dots&quot; where which

dots were connected to what and even some of the dots themselves is precisely

what was lost to freezing damage?

<p>The power of the scan is irrelevant at the resuscitation end if what is

scanned is too critically damaged in some of its major information bearing
