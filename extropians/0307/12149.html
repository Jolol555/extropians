<p>Verbal thought is not the same as rational thought.  Rather, it is a 
<br>
particular kind of heavily abstract chain of deliberative statements, 
<br>
often divorced from the intuitions that usually guide it.  Abstract verbal 
<br>
reasoning is only *more rational* if it *actually works better* - remember 
<br>
that at the heart of all this is Bayes' Theorem, which makes no mention of 
<br>
where the cognition is carried out.  If you are going to discuss genocide 
<br>
'rationally' rather than 'instinctively' - and that should always be in 
<br>
quote marks - then you had better know the evolutionary psychology and 
<br>
game theory and everything else that lies behind those instincts, the 
<br>
reason why the instincts are there in the first place, why the ethical 
<br>
instincts are if anything far too *weak* rather than the other way around. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't understand the evolutionary psychology of genocide, the 
<br>
game theory of cooperation, the ethics of deep uncertainty about the 
<br>
future, the historical outcomes of similar proposals, then all you are 
<br>
doing by reasoning 'rationally' (verbally) is taking the safety catch off 
<br>
a deadly gun.  I see no reason why someone who starts reasoning verbally, 
<br>
and ignorantly, about genocide under the banner of 'rationality', should 
<br>
be thought of any differently from someone who advocates genocide with 
<br>
passionate hatred under the Romantic banner of 'honest feeling'.  Yes, it 
<br>
is possible to discuss genocide rationally, and whaddaya know, when you 
<br>
discuss it rationally, in full knowledge of all the forces at play, it 
<br>
turns out to be a more horrifying idea than mere emotional revulsion would 
<br>
suggest.  I don't see rationality at work here.  I see an emotional 
<br>
disconnect combined with historical, psychological, evolutionary, 
<br>
game-theoretical, and decision-theoretical ethical ignorance.  Yes, there 
<br>
is a verbal explanation, and it is a critical thing to learn.  But if you 
<br>
don't know it, you'd better not try and switch off your emotions until you do.
