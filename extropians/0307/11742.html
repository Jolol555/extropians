<p>Think what you will about my intellectual strength. I know my abilities and
<br>
my limits pretty good. Fortunately I am not ambitious enough to regard
<br>
rational intelligence as my most valuable fetish, 24 hours a day.
<br>
<p>Karen, I strongly advice you to read Robert's original mail and then ask
<br>
yourself *who* is the jerk here? He cold-bloodedly proposed a genocide, I
<br>
wrote a *friendly* letter and attacked this view. And now *I* am regarded as
<br>
the bad boy and not this potential mega killer.
<br>
<p>I clearly said: &quot;in some extreme cases&quot; I believe it's appropriate to attack
<br>
someone personally. I  would not see the slightest reason to attack anybody
<br>
because of any extreme intellectual views. I can think about them, reject
<br>
them, but I never would attack a person because of his visions. But
<br>
I *do* resort to sarcasm and irony, when it comes to the support of killing
<br>
people, because I don't see any other way to express my disgust at the
<br>
idea of mass murdering. Should I appeal to his rational intelligence -
<br>
the very feature he is so proud of? What do you suppose, I
<br>
should say to somebody who proposes a genocide: &quot;This is not very ethical,
<br>
Robert!&quot;? No, I simply want him to know that I have a strong suspicion that
<br>
he might be an asshole, if that is okay with him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [. . .] with the cool-headed, rational,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious deliberation that the issue deserves. I believe your approach in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a situation would be a detriment to the cause.
</em><br>
<p>As I said before, in the face of such a monstrous thought, Robert has
<br>
expressed, all rules of politeness vanish. You can regard my recourse to
<br>
sarcasm and irony as a weakness, that's okay, maybe it is, but when it comes
<br>
to utilitarian thinking desasters like this one, for me the case is obvious
<br>
I can save my intellectual powers for more difficult issues. This one here
<br>
does not need more than healthy guts and a rough understanding of
<br>
Kant's categorial imperative.
<br>
<p>I don`t want to get involved in a *discussion* about genocide.
<br>
Thank you very much. If the majority believes, this depravity is even
<br>
worth a discussion, then, I think it's an act of superior intelligence to
<br>
leave this forum and waste my time with more pleasant things than
<br>
dealing with infantile jerks who believe they will save humanity by nuking
<br>
poor countries who do not fit in the Western (that is US) system of values.
<br>
<p>Good night Extropy!
