</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe than you were 10 years ago? 20 years ago? What are the major

</em><br>
<p>In 1993, gun owners were beeing assassinated and torched in their homes
<br>
for exercising their constitutional rights here in the US. Of course I
<br>
feel safer today than I did then.
<br>
In 1983, less than a dozen states in the US had 'shall issue' concealed
<br>
carry permit laws. Today 35 states have such laws or require no permit
<br>
at all to do so. Of course I feel safer today than I did then.
<br>
The major threats to my continued existence/lifestyle are:
<br>
<p>a) liberal Democrats (not all Democrats)
<br>
b) statist Republicans (not all Republicans)
<br>
c) the two party system
<br>
d) the continued lack of liberty present in the rest of the world,
<br>
particularly the muslim and communist worlds, which continues to feed
<br>
the phobias and fears that give strength to statists of both parties
<br>
and the electoral system they hold hostage.
<br>
e) continued lack of rationality and intelligence in statist camps that
<br>
results in such stupidities as the cancelling of the Terror Futures
<br>
Market.
<br>
(not necessarily in this order)
<br>
Ten and twenty years ago, pilots could not fly armed, and air marshals
<br>
were a very minor agency with minimal staffing.
<br>
<p>As for ten years from now, if present trends continue, I forsee:
<br>
a) shall issue CCW permit laws (or no permit required laws) in at least
<br>
43 US states).
<br>
b) federal laws mandating that CCW permits issued by one state are
<br>
valid in all states. States that refuse to recognise other states CCW
<br>
permits lose federal transportation and national guard funding. Other
<br>
states may refuse to recognise drivers licenses from non-reciprocal CCW
<br>
states, as well as refuse to recognise driverse license suspensions
<br>
from non-reciprocal states. This would all be based on the theory that
<br>
priviledges (as states claim drivers licenses are) should not be
<br>
afforded greater protection and recognition than rights.
<br>
c) the so called 'assault weapons ban' will sunset without renewal
<br>
d) the so called Gun Ownership Protection Act of 1986 will be reversed.
<br>
sale of newly manufactured class III weapons will be legalized to
<br>
civilians.
<br>
e) the courts will rule that any tax on firearms or ammunition of more
<br>
than 10% of the manufacturers recommended retail price is intended not
<br>
as a revinue measure but as a means of raising barriers to a citizens
<br>
ability to exercise their constitutional rights. As a result the NFA of
<br>
1934 will be rescinded.
<br>
f) tort reform laws that make it criminally unlawful to sue any
<br>
manufacturer of a product for the consequences of its proper use, nor
<br>
for the abuse or improper use of such a product by third parties.
<br>
g) shooting ranges will be federally protected zones where gun owners
<br>
and users can freely shoot without intereference or malfeasance by
<br>
others, including state and local governments.
<br>
h) harassment of a private citizen engaged in wildlife management will
<br>
become a federal crime.
<br>
i) Terrorists will be dealthly afraid of setting foot in the US.
