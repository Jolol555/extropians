<em>&gt; Perhaps my imagination is simply drained, but it's hard to see what kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of work I can usefully do in my free time, to contribute to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultratechnologies.
</em><br>
<p>But is contributing to the ultratechnologies the best way of furthering 
<br>
transhuman goals? There are certainly some technologies that would 
<br>
benefit from more people tinkering, and some transhumanists that are 
<br>
well into relevant technologies and developing them. But then there is 
<br>
the rest of the project: we need to make sure these technologies are 
<br>
usable for transhuman goals, and not just furthering of current human 
<br>
goals (or even worse, dangerous or subhumanity-causing). Here we need 
<br>
people participating in the public debate to make the transhumanist 
<br>
position acceptable at the negotiation table, here we need people 
<br>
analysing stuff on all scales to point out possibilities and threats, 
<br>
here we need people trying out different solutions, technologies and 
<br>
social networks to see what works and what doesn't work. And of course, 
<br>
it would be great to have more people with funding opportunities within 
<br>
this ideological sphere. 
<br>
<p>Some of this is &quot;activism&quot; and some of it is &quot;scholarship&quot;. But there is
<br>
also plenty of room of being an entrepreneur and a transhumanist
<br>
(selling something transhuman, making money that can be used in
<br>
transhuman ways or just having a transhumanism friendly organisation) or 
<br>
even doing it from the inside of an organisation (sure, foobar corp 
<br>
might not care the least about transhumanity, but if the marketing 
<br>
department has a transhumanist flair or the research department 
<br>
understand the importance of nanotech the effects can be rather good - 
<br>
for all involved). 
<br>
<p>As I see it the question &quot;how can I get involved?&quot; can be turned into 
<br>
the question-tree: &quot;Can I turn my current activities and interests into 
<br>
something more useful? If not, do I want to change them in such a 
<br>
direction?&quot;. Most people are going to find that the first step actually 
<br>
gives plenty of room for practical action.
