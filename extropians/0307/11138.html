<p>
I have been thinking in my mind upon the old question of
<br>
wealth creation.
<br>
<p>I will sheeplishly admit that my first recent thoughts
<br>
on this eternal subject a couple of days ago projected
<br>
my own spending habits onto other people.
<br>
<p>The reality is that most Americans want many goods that
<br>
they do not have, and will spend almost everything that
<br>
they have in order to obtain them. Of course, as always
<br>
there is wide diversity and a continuum between complete
<br>
thrift and complete abandon.
<br>
<p>So when the Republicans began to talk about putting money
<br>
in the hands of those who would go spend it and that this
<br>
would help the economy, I was skeptical.  It seemed to me
<br>
that this would not result in any true wealth creation.
<br>
&quot;Consider&quot;, I told one acquaintance, &quot;what would happen
<br>
if in order to inspire confidence in the economy, the
<br>
government simply exhorted all the citizens to go buy
<br>
something, or printed up a lot of money and distributed
<br>
it at random. This would fail to create wealth because it
<br>
would only cause a lot of people to engage temporarily in
<br>
&quot;fake work&quot; and produce a lot of crap that people didn't
<br>
really want---didn't really want, that is, badly enough
<br>
to spend their own money on it&quot;.
<br>
<p>I went on to say that this is how socialist countries often
<br>
operated; by trying to get the masses to have such a positive
<br>
frame of mind that they'd all work themselves to the bone for
<br>
the greater good, and that indeed while the economic metrics
<br>
might for a short time reflect what looked like an advance,
<br>
it was simply a dog chasing its tail.  True wealth creation
<br>
is a mysterious, magical process that cannot be so easily
<br>
engendered.
<br>
<p>However, upon talking to yet others, I have been subsequently
<br>
thinking (perhaps mainly only in my mind, after all, like normal
<br>
people) that the phenomenon of wealth creation, in a number of
<br>
circumstances, indeed can be advanced by tax cuts, and perhaps
<br>
even by printing more money!  How is this possible?
<br>
<p>Under certain special circumstances (which probably human beings
<br>
are really not so good at identifying, and probably governments
<br>
even less) it could be that a thing could happen which would
<br>
make everyone happy, and advance progress:  people could be 
<br>
employed making goods (which in this day often means using
<br>
more-or-less advanced technology) that other people really do
<br>
want, but which the latter folks are scared to purchase.  It
<br>
could happen, as it did during the depression of the 1930's, 
<br>
that if were people only more confident of the future then they'd
<br>
spend, and not spend on junk, but spend on things that they
<br>
TRULY WANTED and which provided them, ultimately, with the
<br>
incentive to ever work (themselves) in the first place.  Thus,
<br>
money placed into the hands of most Americans would (i) cause
<br>
a number of people to make purchases of things they wanted, 
<br>
and (ii) result in a slight lengthening of the capital structure
<br>
as workers would get more practice turning out stuff.  (The
<br>
latter, too, would be very happy to have the work.)
<br>
<p>Why, just where do I stop with this train of thought?  Why not
<br>
indeed when confidence is low have some state (say California)
<br>
print up a lot of money and distribute it to its most reliable
<br>
citizens, namely those who have to pay taxes?
<br>
<p>If the unemployment is being caused in this case primarily not
<br>
because entrepreneurs don't know what to do (the usual case)
<br>
but because those with money are afraid to spend it (or afraid
<br>
to go into more debt), why not?
<br>
