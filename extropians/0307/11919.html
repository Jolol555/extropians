<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;.  I propose to do away with all stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures, and, in fact, probably most matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is not itself intelligent and capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting along quite nicely without pain.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So all bacteria, mammals, reptiles and birds will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exterminated, uploaded, uplifted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, much in the way that when you built your house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---or hired mercenaries to do it for you---all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ants and bacteria living where the concrete foundation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is got snuffed.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; You take much upon yourself from your current rather limited and puny 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.  
</em><br>
<p>*My* puny understanding?  **My** puny understanding??
<br>
Is this not a case of the pot calling the kettle black?
<br>
<p>Seriously, this is an interesting statement coming from
<br>
someone who thinks that some kind of ironclad rules need
<br>
to be created in order to avoid insults, personal attacks,
<br>
and flames.
<br>
<p>*My* puny understanding?  Well I can dish it out as well
<br>
as you can:  May the fleas of a thousand camels infest
<br>
your nostril.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; All matter should be *at least* as feeling and thoughtful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as your own best 10 cc's of brain tissue.  And with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; miniaturization, I'm sure that even our brains at present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are largely wasteful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arbitrary.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I *think* you got my point.  So what is arbitrary?
<br>
The &quot;10ccs&quot;?  Of course it's not a measurement---I was
<br>
trying to convey the idea.  I do wish that there was more
<br>
substance in some of your gripes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, what's the matter with *our* ethics, that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human ethics?  IMO there are very few really evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people.  I have never met anyone who I think would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not make a good God.  (Yes, some people would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better than others, but no one I have ever met would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dish out disaster and hardship the way old Jehovah
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The vast majority of humans are not &quot;evil&quot; by the standards of the vast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of humans.  However, this does not mean that their ethics is ok and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly does not mean that it will work perfectly well as we get greater 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities for good or harm.  Most people are not particularly compassionate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and believe that achieving their interests can be done at the expense of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others and this is perfectly ok as long as one can get away with it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree.  I agree, that is, with what you surely
<br>
mean (far be it from me to pick at words or phrases).
<br>
It is *not* perfectly okay, but yes, of course, they
<br>
do indeed appear to think that it is, and more importantly,
<br>
behave as if they think it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have seen on this very list talk about how the first uploads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or AIs should/would preclude others from becoming as powerful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, the old reptilian/mammal/primate power dominance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended straight into godhood. This assumptions have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made on many, many levels on this very list.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I just don't understand.  I do not believe that it is
<br>
only a tendency stemming from our ancient impulses.  Rather,
<br>
it is a logical conclusion under some circumstances.  Now,
<br>
of course, what the exact circumstances are or will be is
<br>
the subject of discussion, and you probably just disagree
<br>
with many about what those circumstances will be.  But I am
<br>
sure that in *some* situations, you would find it quite
<br>
prudent to prevent another entity (e.g. smallpox) from 
<br>
rising up against you, and would take preventive measures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find the notion that the average Joe or Jill elevate to God powers would do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just fine to be one of the most deeply troublesome statements I have ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encountered here.  With great power goes great responsibility.  With great 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power goes great need for wisdom. 
</em><br>
<p>Okay, pick someone on this list.  Now imagine that they've
<br>
got all the God-technology at their personal command.  Just
<br>
how bad do you think it would be?  Even if it was Damien B.,
<br>
I am sure that the damage would be quite limited.
<br>
<p>Yes, I agree that we are probably better off not having anyone,
<br>
even a saint, possess such control.  But that is in my opinion
<br>
only because we are so close to obtaining individual self-
<br>
control, and so close to a Singularity (geologically speaking,
<br>
if not lifetime speaking).  Can you really imagine that say
<br>
the 13th century when perhaps 60 million Chinese were slaughtered
<br>
by Genghis Khan, and innumerable people all over the world went
<br>
through the typical tribulations of semi-literate people, that
<br>
it wouldn't have been MUCH better with almost anyone you can
<br>
name?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Given that there exist states of matter so advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that a few cubic centimeters of it could emulate our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entire civilization sans the really unpleasant stuff,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why not convert the whole solar system to that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mean besides the likelihood that the entire solar system is being run 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within something like that?  :-)   
</em><br>
<p>Well, I give that scant likelihood (and have stayed out
<br>
of those debates because the probability is so elusive
<br>
even for Bayesians) to that scenario.  It would be someone
<br>
cruel indeed if this were a simulation and he had God-like
<br>
powers.  &quot;If God is God, then He is not good; if God is
<br>
good, then He is not God.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It would be a crime in my book to leave any matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatsoever out of that equation---and that certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; includes mindless trees and insects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, presumably you include all humans who do not choose to be uploaded in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category of &quot;wasted&quot; matter that should be converted anyway?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, afraid so.  When we can *guarantee* to a 99.9 percent probability
<br>
that the life of an Amish farmer will go exactly the same inside
<br>
the simulation, then I say upload him and be done with it.  There
<br>
are too many other non-existent entities that need those resources.
