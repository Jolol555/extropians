<em>&gt; &gt; Sigh....
</em><br>
<p>The last 3 months, my participation has fallen off significantly,
<br>
primarily due to my activities in support of the Free State Project. I
<br>
just can't be bothered with snitty little carping from a bunch of
<br>
people who in my opinion are about the most non-action-oriented people
<br>
I've ever met, online or offline, in my life (this doesn't apply to all
<br>
members of the list, just most of the active posters). The last two
<br>
years of pathetic inaction by ExI to deal with the luddite threat is
<br>
just the most blatant and important example. The daily and weekly
<br>
sniping by individuals whose only calling in life seems to be entirely
<br>
about figuring out reasons why things shouldn't be done is just the
<br>
most frequent recurring annoyance. That ain't friggin extropian in the
<br>
least.
<br>
<p>The extropian and transhumanist community is full of so many melvinated
<br>
complainers, carpers, snipers and all around do-nothings that it is no
<br>
wonder nothing gets done. Anybody with any initiative of any
<br>
significant degree went away long ago.
<br>
<p>In the time frame that ExI has had some great media opportunities and
<br>
chances to make significant impact and grow its membership
<br>
significantly, and done pretty much nothing with them, a small upstart
<br>
project that was the idea of a Yale graduate student in 2001 has
<br>
exceeded ExI's membership significantly, has garnered exponentially
<br>
MORE media coverage, and has attracted people who are fed up with the
<br>
abject failure of the National Libertarian Party to make any electoral
<br>
headway.
<br>
<p>The Free State Project is taking one very extropian idea and has run
<br>
with it. Next month, when we hit 5,000 members, we will decide which
<br>
state will be the free state. We are raising funds, we are delegated
<br>
projects and responsibilities. Local groups are forming and taking
<br>
action. The Welcome to the Granite State Committee of the Libertarian
<br>
Party of New Hampshire is currently mailing a recruitment letter to
<br>
nearly 1000 former members of the Connecticut Libertarian Party (we
<br>
figure former party members are sick of debating societies and want
<br>
action) seeking their support for NH in the upcoming FSP state
<br>
election. We are sending out a fund raiser letter to do another
<br>
recruitment blitz to over 25,000 current and former Libertarian members
<br>
and voters in Massachusetts.
<br>
<p>This is how real activist groups operate. They don't sit on their duffs
<br>
and host tea parties, run online debating societies, or operate like
<br>
some ivory tower think tank. Real activist groups take action. They
<br>
accomplish goals, and they get their message out and recruit membership
<br>
and financial support. They meet the powers that be (a bunch of us met
<br>
Governor Benson two weeks ago), and recruit support from within their
<br>
ranks (two members of the NH House are FSP members and the Governor's
<br>
Efficiency in Government committee chair John Babiarz, (also chairman
<br>
of the LPNH), is a member.
<br>
<p>This all exactly what ExI AIN'T done, and as far as I can see, WON'T
<br>
do. It's too bad, cause this inaction by ExI is highly unextropic. If
<br>
the luddites win, it will be entirely ExI's fault.
