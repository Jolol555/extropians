NB: I've changed references from Most Selfish Individual
<br>
to just Individual with a survival-orientation and deleted
<br>
the side issue of altruism. If I've over-simplified please
<br>
feel free to restore.

<em>&gt; &gt; Any 'leap of faith' this (..) Individual takes will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as *small* and late as he can make them.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But we are talking about a survival-oriented, {..}
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; view of  {what is &quot;in it&quot; for} an individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *I* perceive the world from a stand-point that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessarily  self-centred. *My* senses collect data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and *my* brain interprets it as information. My &quot;self&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a process which I understand emerges along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness has amongst its attributes a desire for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;self&quot; preservation. It's a pretty strong desire and my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  worldview rightly or wrong informs *my* self about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what seem to be more and less optimal ways to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pursue that desire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All that is very true.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snipped altruism as a side issue&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose that there existed a machine that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; decompose you into your constituent elements 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; within a microsecond.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then suppose that a few microseconds later, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  reconstitutes you.  Now suppose that this entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  process happens hundreds of times per second...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ok. Stipulations noted. If I was to discover that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had in fact  been happening my worldview would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessarily change. I might conclude that continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot be a necessary precondition for self-hood, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have come to experience it, because I hadn't ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had continuity, I'd have been mistaken. 
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; However, we might further imagine that you lived in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population one-half of which underwent this operation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one hundred times per second.  At this point, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuition might suggest that since everyone acted as if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were conscious, and were the same person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then perhaps it was true.
</em><br>
<p>This extra scenario doesn't advance us very far because
<br>
I already conceded that all others are only knowable to
<br>
me in a discontinuous and inferential way. I only experience
<br>
myself as a continuity because it is only myself as conscious
<br>
and unconscious processes that I have access to. Now if
<br>
I were to discover I was one of the 50% that had undergone
<br>
the operations previously unbeknownst to me then that 
<br>
would have the same effect on me as your above scenario.
<br>
I.e. As my worldview would now include the acceptance
<br>
that I had been interrupted in the past in fact 100 times
<br>
every second that I would have to abandon either my notion
<br>
self-hood could not survive an interruption of continuity or
<br>
I'd have to alter my notion of self-hood into something more
<br>
sophisticated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We routinely avoid solipsism by extending this notion to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people (even though we feel no pain when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are pinched), and also go so far as to extend it to animals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what is important is the *story*, the *explanation* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind the scenes.  If it's not at all compelling, then the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above thought experiment has little point.  The story is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that when you examine the *physics* associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this operation happening to someone else, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder just what could be the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the various 1/100 second versions. 
</em><br>
<p>Well from my point of view if I'm not one of the 1/100
<br>
second versions I can accept that a sufficiently faithful
<br>
copy is going to be good enough to satisfy me in the
<br>
case of others. I only had a discontinuous relationship 
<br>
with them anyway, If they are happy and I am unable
<br>
to tell the difference then I let the result, that I can 
<br>
pick up my relationship with these others and they 
<br>
with me seamlessly speak for itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In what sense are they different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people?  
</em><br>
<p>Sure I'd wonder about what the differences might be 
<br>
between them and me if any. Sure it would make me
<br>
consider that *perhaps* continuity *might* not be
<br>
crucial to the preservation of my self-hood.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How is it possible that a person associated with one of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanishes the next instant?
</em><br>
<p>Ah this is not hard at all really. As an atheist its standard stuff
<br>
for me to hold that all persons historically have lived lives
<br>
of limited duration. I assume no person is a person before
<br>
birth (or perhaps somewhat after when they are conscious)
<br>
and no person is a person after death but in between their
<br>
personhood is continuous. Its the continuous vs. 
<br>
discontinuous thing that is of major significance. Any 
<br>
discontinuity at all however brief (of the mental processing
<br>
in the wetware substrate) requires me to revisit my view of
<br>
self-hood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only way that I have been able to figure out how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be possible for another person to flash into existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for 1/100th of a second, and then to vanish forever into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-existence, is if indeed there is someone overhead Who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is stamping out souls, and assigning them to these copies.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But we reject this (most of us).
</em><br>
<p>I do. I think we tend to over anthropomorphise when we 
<br>
confront unknowns. We tend to posit creatures like ourselves
<br>
less some of our limitations.
<br>
<p>Consciousness is associated with some forms of life. 
<br>
Historically all forms of animal live for a time then die.
<br>
Some insects live very briefly, some mammals quite 
<br>
long. The soul stuff doesn't help either way in my view
<br>
its a red herring. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, it seems far more likely that our minds are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contaminated with lingering notions of a soul, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is responsible for our uneasiness at the prospect, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, of being teleported, or disassembled and reassembled.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. Our experience of life as involving 
<br>
development (sometimes accompanied by development 
<br>
of consciousness) over a period followed by death is
<br>
enough I think. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ... the question is once an adult level of sentience is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; achieved can you capture the recursion counters 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the wetware? A snapshot of the conscious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process and memories and restore it either onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an identical wetware substrate or a different set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of firmware on an upload. I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not?  [why couldn't these &quot;recursion counters&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  be captured]
</em><br>
<p>Given that the recursion counters would be in the brain 
<br>
I guess they should be capturable (in principle) given a
<br>
sufficiently fast technology. But this going to need a 
<br>
snapshot of a massively parallel and dynamic set of 
<br>
processes. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because I don't *know* enough about how my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness and the experience of self-hood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manifests to assume that it can persist completely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decoupled from a matter substrate for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; length of time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No one that I know of imagines that it can persist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without a material substrate, except non-materialists.
</em><br>
<p>Aren't cryonicists and uploaders positing that all that is
<br>
important to the self can be captured as information,
<br>
stored for some period of time, even if its only briefly,
<br>
then the self is recreated from that information? In the 
<br>
middle, a substrate is there, it may be a tape or optical
<br>
disk or something but the transfer to substrate is 
<br>
wholesale (and there is a big question as to how this 
<br>
could be done - outside this discussion).
<br>
<p>Do you imagine the transfer of all the info happens at 
<br>
the speed of light? 
<br>
<p>I see discontinuity of self-hood as part of either the
<br>
cryonics or uploading processes (perhaps not if an 
<br>
incremental upload is done on a living brain).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My current thinking is no substrate means no conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processing (or unconscious processing either). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness process means no self concept process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In short I assume that no brain means a discontinuation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of me because it seems prudent to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, certainly.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; How do you bring about that instant in wetware when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all the pieces come together at once?  This would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; require an extraordinary feat not just of construction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but of coordinating the synchronous assembly of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perishable components in real time and bringing them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; together in that instant that is the deadline. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Doesn't seem &quot;easy&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ;-)  I meant easy in the philosophical sense.  Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are mechanical devices, the same applies to us as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any other machine that you disassemble. 
</em><br>
<p>Thinking of ourselves as mechanical devices may be a
<br>
mistake. We are not supernaturally configured I agree.
<br>
But there *may* be an important distinction between
<br>
growing and being assembled. There are no mechanical
<br>
devices that I am aware of that change their substrate
<br>
and develop anything that looks like consciousness over
<br>
time in doing so yet. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When a heart ceases to beat, indeed, a jolt may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary  to get it once again into the state wherein it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begins to operate all by itself.  An ideal brain brought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a complete state of readiness one day may require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar jolt (perhaps merely along sensory nerves) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get it going again.  
</em><br>
<p>Seems your positing a brain sitting there doing nothing
<br>
and not being dead. Perhaps its like being critically 
<br>
dead. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I believe that neurons can be prepared in states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that they fire spontaneously.
</em><br>
<p>But in massively parallel architectures such as must 
<br>
occur with even unconscious processes like dreams?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So one hardly need fear that one's brain would just &quot;sit&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there if one were uploaded, copied, or teleported. 
</em><br>
<p>Your reassurances are not overly reassuring for some
<br>
reason ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, the usual philosophical questions are pursued by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even adding in that all the original atoms are given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their original velocities as well.  Thus the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resumes its activity in a way that is physically completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to the original.  
</em><br>
<p>So in say cryonics your positing not the substitution of 
<br>
atoms of the same type into a corresponding space but
<br>
the actual original atoms themselves? This seems 
<br>
problematic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is disturbed less by this operation (in principle) than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is by an annoying phone call.
</em><br>
<p>By here the difference between principle and practice
<br>
become important. Some things like Esher's drawings
<br>
may look superficially plausible but would be impossible
<br>
for a builder to construct. 
<br>
<p>Besides if we don't know what it is that's crucial to 
<br>
preserve for self-hood uploading to a different type of
<br>
substrate won't work. The substrate is the brain. 
<br>
Consciousness would have most likely have emerged
<br>
as the brain developed it would not have been ported
<br>
onto it like software onto hardware.
