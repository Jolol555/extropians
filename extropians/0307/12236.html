<p>See, this is what I find most mind-boggling in your faulty recollection of
<br>
the book. How could a reader have missed this pivotal moment of cognitive
<br>
and affective breakthrough? I guess I just have to type the damned thing out:
<br>
<p>Andrew Wiggins (Ender) speaks of the hive species, the `Buggers', he
<br>
exterminated:
<br>
<p>&lt; They found me through the ansible, followed it and dwelt in my mind. In
<br>
the agony of my tortured dreams they came to know me, even as I spent my
<br>
days destroying them; they found my fear of them, and found also that I had
<br>
no knowledge I was killing them... We are like you; the thought pressed
<br>
into his mind. We did not mean to murder, and when we understood, we never
<br>
came again. We thought we were the only thinking beings in the universe,
<br>
until we met you, but never did we dream that thought could arise from the
<br>
lonely animals who cannot dream each other's dreams. How were we to know?
<br>
We could live with you in peace. Believe us, believe us, believe us.'

</em><br>
<p>I'd be up for that, implausible though it seems. Although...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I guess it's good that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>...it's been said before that humans approximate to that description for

many biota here on earth. But me, I'm on the side of the humans, poor
<br>
genetically biased creature that I am.
