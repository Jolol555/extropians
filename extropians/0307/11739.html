<em>&gt; &gt;Given it seems that there are some others who share my frustration

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that Natasha has ascended to run ExI, I'd like to propose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;someone new and more action oriented be elected or appointed to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;forth to actually put some Act back in Pro-Act (unless by 'act' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you mean a put-on).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I have made similar proposals, that Pro-Act get its butt in gear, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;least twice before, which were both totally ignored by the lords of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ExI, with neither public nor private response. Consider this my last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;request. If the people on high continue to blow it off, I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;consider my need for this organization to be at an end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going to give the same response to your public post that I did to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your  private post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only comment I have to make is that sometimes things happen which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets in the way of our plans.  People lose jobs, get divorced, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with a death of a loved one.  These unplanned wild cards can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interrupt our lives to such a degree that sometimes, we have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start all over again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not the case with me.  What I had intended to do with Pro-Act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be accomplished in another way, through another means, with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another goal, and for another, but I think better, result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, it is unfortunate that the very day at Extro 5 that I gave my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk and made a public announcement of Pro-Act I was hemorging.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also unfortunate that I learned I have cancer 2 days later, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that I had surgery 3 days later, and have spent the last 2 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years in remission.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dealing with cancer is major.
</em><br>
<p>No doubt. Any time I have seen others dealing with such difficulties,
<br>
they have always passed the baton on to others, though. They didn't
<br>
just let something die on the vine. This should have been done with
<br>
Pro-Act. The cause is more important than any individuals personal
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Putting this aside, I think my concept of Pro-Act was a success
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because what I have been doing for the past two years has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far above and beyond what I had planned to do as a person and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with activism, and pursuing a very important and well-needed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept for the world.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think so, nor do many others who have emailed me with
<br>
their support. Nor can you point to any actual accomplishments, either.
<br>
The Luddites continue to win, legislatively, commercially, and in
<br>
public sentiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I'm not going to state here what my plans are at this time.
</em><br>
<p>This is par for the course.
