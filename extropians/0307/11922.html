<p><em>&gt; [Samantha writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I find the notion that the average Joe or Jill elevate to God powers would do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just fine to be one of the most deeply troublesome statements I have ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; encountered here.  With great power goes great responsibility.  With great 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power goes great need for wisdom. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, pick someone on this list.  Now imagine that they've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got all the God-technology at their personal command.  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how bad do you think it would be?  Even if it was Damien B.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sure that the damage would be quite limited.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I agree that we are probably better off not having anyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even a saint, possess such control.
</em><br>
<p>I have reconsidered.  There are only one or two idealists
<br>
on this list that I would truly be afraid to give God-like
<br>
powers to.  (These are hyper-rational individuals who'd
<br>
likely implement one of their abstract visions.)  But I
<br>
may be wrong:  even *they* might be just fine.
<br>
<p>Seriously, do you think anyone here would do as bad a job as
<br>
old Jehovah is doing?
