<em>&gt; &gt; So there are two ways of &quot;reducing taxes&quot;. (1) cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  spending.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stop right there.  What possible incentive do government 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employees have to cut spending?
</em><br>
<p>First, to be clear, I wasn't saying that *government employees*,
<br>
(as opposed to government ministers), either as a class, or as
<br>
individuals do have such an incentive.
<br>
<p>The decision to cut spending is usually made by a the 
<br>
government - by elected officials without lifetime tenure. Their
<br>
incentive is to get elected and giving money back to taxpayers
<br>
is pretty easily perceived by most taxpayers as a good for them
<br>
all else being equal.
<br>
<p>But to answer your question, government employees are not 
<br>
only members of the government employee class. As
<br>
individuals there are many other groups with claims on their
<br>
loyalty. A competent government employee that can daily see
<br>
what other incompetent government employees are wasting
<br>
money on and who genuinely desires to be a public servant
<br>
would not necessarily be hard to find. Every departmental
<br>
restructure sends government departments and individuals
<br>
in them looking for their own place in the new scheme.
<br>
<p>A minister hands down a need to a department head for a
<br>
10% cut and the department head looks for the ways to
<br>
realise that cut or tries to oppose the cut as the department
<br>
head sees fit. Some negotiation may ensue by a competent 
<br>
department head will at least go back to the minister armed 
<br>
with information that supports his case.  The department
<br>
head sends a message down to his/her subordinates look for
<br>
ways to cut costs. Those that find them, perhaps at pointing
<br>
out inefficiencies due to technological change that make say
<br>
a few old clerical types redundant will probably be rewarded. 
<br>
<p>Human nature being what it is not all the recommendations for
<br>
employee cuts will be motivated by the higher good. Some
<br>
will want to settle old scores, remove competitors, use the
<br>
opportunities in the restructure to alter their competitive
<br>
position.
<br>
<p>I am inferring from your question a view that government
<br>
employees see themselves as a class and that their class 
<br>
loyalties are not easily shaken up. I think this is mistaken.
<br>
Other loyalties in the case of almost all individuals that 
<br>
happen to be government employees, such as loyalty
<br>
to oneself, one's family, one's friends, and even to the
<br>
ideal of good public service will in some cases if not
<br>
almost all cases be stronger.
<br>
