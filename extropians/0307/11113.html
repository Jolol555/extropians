</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry my suggestion didn't work.  I keyed off your statement that AOL
<br>
was rejecting extropy.org saying &quot;550 DIRECT CONNECTION FROM DIAL-UP OR
<br>
DYNAMIC-IP DENIED&quot; and that this was incorrect.  I therefore jumped on the
<br>
second likely reason.  However, after doing a little further research, I am
<br>
beginning to think that AOL's original error message might be correct.  (Or
<br>
at least I can see why AOL thinks it is.)
<br>
<p>Instead of owning their own network, Javien seems to be utilizing the
<br>
services of an ISP, with their particular IP addresses being assigned from a
<br>
larger block of address owned by the ISP.  This could be the exact situation
<br>
that AOL is intentionally trying to block.  They deliberately intend to
<br>
block modems, DSL connections and dynamic connections through ISPs.  They
<br>
only allow permanent direct owners of an IP to send bulk e-mail.
<br>
<p>1.  The Extropians List is being sent out from tick.javien.com at
<br>
209.115.169.3.
<br>
<p>2.  The name tick.javien.com is just an alias that points to the real name
<br>
of javien2-3.spots.ab.ca, and it is in the spots.ab.ca domain.
<br>
<p>3.  The spots.ab.ca domain is an address range for Spots InterConnect, Inc.
<br>
They are registered as an Internet Service Provider in Alberta, Canada.
<br>
<p>My guess is that extropy.org, extropy.com, sl4.org, lucifer.com, javien.com,
<br>
and everybody else hosted by Spots InterConnect are similarly being blocked.
<br>
You might talk to Spots InterConnect to confirm if all their subscribers are
<br>
being blocked.  If so, they may be able to help resolve this issue at their
<br>
level by informing AOL that these addresses are not dynamic.  However, I am
<br>
not sure AOL will respond, because this bone-headed policy is intentional on
<br>
their part.
<br>
<p>This is apparently a common problem for all mailing lists.  AOL not only
<br>
blocks certain type of addresses as above, they also block on keywords
<br>
indicating messages that are sexual, extremely political, violent, racist or
<br>
subversive.  They also will trigger from subscribers pressing the &quot;report
<br>
spam&quot; button.  They also block mail if any intervening ISP is blocked.  It
<br>
may not even be extropy or javien that is blocked, but some other customer
<br>
of that same ISP.  There are so many ways to get blocked, that it seems to
<br>
be happening to most mailing lists with AOL subscribers.  I am seeing many
<br>
other mailing lists suddenly having the same problems.
<br>
<p>In any case, the problem is apparently well known and definitely inside AOL.
<br>
Their subscribers may simply need to understand that their mail is being
<br>
censored.  The Extropians List is still available to them via the web bbs
<br>
interface, so nobody is completely cut off.
