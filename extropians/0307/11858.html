Harvey said:
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK.  You guys win.  I am leaving this forum.  It is painfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear from all the messages that most people here actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to see the personal attacks, insults and flamewars 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue.  
</em><br>
<p>Most?  I saw only a handfull of respondants that suggested some personal
<br>
attacks can be tolerated.  Noting the difficulty in defining a personal
<br>
attack, it still seems clear that 'most' is not an accurate description
<br>
of the lists opinion.  I think that the vast majority of people do not
<br>
like personal attacks, they do not like receiving them, and are often
<br>
disspointed in themselves after making them.  However, I would remind
<br>
Harvey how often he has argued that silence =/= support.  Just because
<br>
list members didn't rally to your cause (as Lee points out in his
<br>
response to my whinning about getting no responses) it could very well
<br>
mean most agree with you, or don't feel the issue is charged or
<br>
important enough to warrant responses. Apparently only two or three
<br>
people disagreed with you enough to feel it warranted a response.  
<br>
<p>Those who disagree are either silent or have 
<br>
<em>&gt; already left.  Even the moderators, board of directors, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staff do not support my efforts to enforce the existing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules.  Somehow, this particular virtual room has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remodeled into some sort of Fight Club when I wasn't looking. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  My desire for conversation without fighting is ridiculed and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioned.  I apologize as I realize it is I who is out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place.  I will pick up my virtual beverage and head for one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the many other virtual rooms filled with transhumanists.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that I will see most of you in the non-fighting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forums.  To those who only participate here, I bid you farewell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --
</em><br>
<p>So because 3 people disagree with Harvey, out of this entire mailing
<br>
list, he ups and leaves?  Sheesh, if I demanded that level of low
<br>
disagreement numbers I would rarely make it past one sentence before up
<br>
and leaving.
