<p>
I agree with Kevin's comment. At the same time I do not think flames are
<br>
really a big deal. If I post something controversial and get reasoned
<br>
criticism, I try to reply and contribute to the discussion, perhaps I did
<br>
not make my point well or perhaps I was just wrong and said something
<br>
stupid.
<br>
If I get insults and hysterical broken words, I just ignore it, and from
<br>
that moment on I do not consider reading material from that specific poster
<br>
as something worth my time. I really believe that very often the best reply
<br>
to unreasonableness and hysteria is just ignoring it.
<br>
So there is imo no real reason to make a big issue of flames, it is
<br>
something we can live with. Also I have to confess that sometimes flame wars
<br>
can be fun.

<p><p><em>&gt; I'm new here, but it seems odd to me that the largest, most often visited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic on this board is &quot;flame wars&quot;. Over half the traffic on the list
</em><br>
seems
<br>
<em>&gt; to be people complaining about being insulted,  complaining about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complainers, or complaining about the complaining about the complaining.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the risks of putting an idea into the open is that you are
</em><br>
subjecting
<br>
<em>&gt; your opinion to ridicule. If I put an idea out there and someone shoots it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down or makes me look like a fool, I have the option to ignore them just
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; much as they have the option to ignore my statements. Someone has to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the higher ground.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it that a board full of brilliant people seems to have trouble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting things behind them and moving forward? Why is everyone so
</em><br>
sensitive?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, when I throw out an idea, I want to hear exactly what everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to say about it; even if it isn;t very nice. That doesn't mean I want
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; hear name-calling, but I have thick skin and I can take it. Asking people
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; censor their opinions to keep me from &quot;feeling bad&quot; would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counter-productive to my reasons for being here in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So can we PLEASE put this &quot;flame wars&quot; topic behind us? I know I am fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new to this board, but it just seems to be a huge waste of time!
