Robert Bradbury quoted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Impressions From a Visit to North Korea
<br>
<a href="http://www.inesap.org/bulletin20/bul20art31.htm">http://www.inesap.org/bulletin20/bul20art31.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I found the article educational and a bit different from the
<br>
spin we commonly get on the DPRK in the U.S.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I found the article un-nerving, and it added to my fears about North Korea.  
<br>
Sorry.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Some that come to my mind are:
<br>
a) How do extropians/transhumanists deal with very strong cultures
<br>
with very non-western priorities?  (Be they through cultural history
<br>
or brain-washing?)  [This relates to the question of how does one
<br>
interface with a culture that &quot;sets priorities differently&quot;.  Is
<br>
one going to &quot;brain-wash&quot; citizens of the DPRK that western perspectives
<br>
are more correct than those they have grown up with their entire lives?]  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The best way to lead is by example. The best product to sell is success.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;b) How does one deal with the entropic issue that the diplomatic
<br>
route may ultimately be extremely wasteful?  Though I'm sure Nick
<br>
will not appreciate my citing his paper in this context, his
<br>
&quot;Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological
<br>
Development&quot; paper.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Diplomacy, sans power, has lost currency in the modern world. Or, as noted by 
<br>
Talleyrand; the most astute diplomacy is utilized by weakend political 
<br>
states; as a poor substitute for power.
<br>
<p>Regarding your Afghanistan-Bin Laden observation of two years ago; my sense 
<br>
is that merely using nuclear weapons was counter-productive as well as ineffe
<br>
ctive. What we need is a viable energy policy, to buttress a disassociation from 
<br>
petroleum reliance, on middle eastern oil states, chiefly Saudi. This is 
<br>
where, leading by example would have helped us, more then 100 hydrogen bombs. 
<br>
Undermine the financing of the core culture of Wahabbism, will have great benefits 
<br>
to world peace.
<br>
