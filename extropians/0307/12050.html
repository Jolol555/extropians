Best analysis yet.  This is a remarkably unattractive personality.
<br>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________
<br>
<p>When asked by a reporter from the Arcata Eye in 2002 why he wasn't speaking at
<br>
independent bookstores rather than at corporate chains, he exploded in a tirade
<br>
that revealed his willingness to have his principles-in this case, his distrust
<br>
of corporate power-take a backseat to his personal vengefulness. &quot;You know in my
<br>
town the small businesses that everyone wanted to protect? They were the people
<br>
that supported all the right-wing groups,&quot; he ranted. &quot;They were the Republicans
<br>
in town, they were in Kiwanis, the Chamber of Commerce-people that kept the town
<br>
all white. The small hardware salesman, the small clothing store sales persons,
<br>
Jesse the Barber who signed his name three different times on three different
<br>
petitions to recall me from the school board. Fuck all these small
<br>
businesses-fuck 'em all. Bring in the chains.&quot;

[complete lengthy article]
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p>DISCLAIMER:  Not defending any particular statement or action, or 
<br>
disputing any specific information in the article, BUT 
<br>
<p>Moore at least attempts to balance out the incredibly hostile right 
<br>
wing lunatics so very common these days.  Reasoned arguments, 
<br>
listening to your opposite, common courtesy are all very much out of 
<br>
fashion.  At least Moore is attacking people (IMHO) who have very 
<br>
little interest in my personal well-being.
<br>
<p>St. Louis has a holy fool named Larry Rice, (again IMHO) not a very 
<br>
attractive personality and one I disagree with on many fundamental 
<br>
issues, but the only one who stands up and says it was immoral to 
<br>
spend gazillons on new sports stadia, etc., when people are starving, 
<br>
that sort of thing.
<br>
<p>Rice has not, to my knowledge, ever profited and appears to live on 
<br>
about the same level as his homeless shelters, if not in them.  It is 
<br>
possible that Moore is a calculated money-grubber but he also appears 
<br>
to be in it more for the princle than some that pollute our airwaves.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Moore at least attempts to balance out the incredibly hostile right 
<br>
<em>&gt; wing lunatics so very common these days. Reasoned arguments, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listening to your opposite, common courtesy are all very much out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion. 
</em><br>
<p>None more so than with Moore, whose appearances on TV debates inevitably end 
<br>
up in him attempting to shout down his opponents.

<p>Lynn disturbed my rest to tell me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;DISCLAIMER:  Not defending any particular statement or action, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disputing any specific information in the article, BUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moore at least attempts to balance out the incredibly hostile right

</em><br>
<em>&gt;little interest in my personal well-being.
</em><br>
<p>I still go with the lovely image somebody came up with in Might 
<br>
magazine way back when - Moore made it big because the left thought 
<br>
they needed their own big fat idiot to balance out Rush Limbaugh. His 
<br>
heart's very much in the right place, but there was a lot of &quot;Bowling 
<br>
for Columbine&quot;, for example, that just seemed to be cheap sentiment 
<br>
dressed up as some sort of radicalism (most notably the very end).
<br>
<p>As I'm sure I've mentioned before, I literally bumped into Moore in 
<br>
Shaftesbury Avenue last winter, while he was doing his stint at the 
<br>
Roundhouse in Camden, and the conversation went roughly thus:
<br>
Self: I've just read &quot;Stupid White Men&quot;, it's really good to see 
<br>
stuff like that getting out there.
<br>
Moore: Have you come to the see the show yet?
<br>
Self: Er, not yet.
<br>
Moore: There's only three or four performances left, it's really 
<br>
great, you should come. Anyway, see ya.

Talking of Moore, has anyone else seen &quot;As-yet unproven claims by Michael Moore&quot; 
on &lt; <a href="http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/">http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/</a> &gt; (a videogame humour site for bitter SEGA 
fans).  The present one is: &quot;Tap water is really raw sewage dyed with 
see-through bleach&quot;.  Not actually as funny as the rest of the site but there 
you go.
