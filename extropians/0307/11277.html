</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the premises, in my opinion.  If you draw a picture of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem, perhaps, you may be less likely to misread it than if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you plug the numbers into a formula.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, Lee, it's perfectly straightforward to solve the problem from these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Observe:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(deformity) = 0.01
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(~deformity) = 0.99
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella|~deformity) = 0.1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella|deformity) = 0.5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella&amp;~deformity) = p(r|~d)p(~d) = .1*.99 = .099
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella&amp;deformity) = p(r|d)p(d) = .5*.01 = .005
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(rubella) = p(r&amp;d) + p(r&amp;~d) = .104
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(deformity|rubella) = p(rubella&amp;deformity)/p(rubella) = .005/.104 = .048
</em><br>
<p>Now, wait a minute.
<br>
<p>You begin with p(deformity) = 0.01.  I presume that's your interpretation
<br>
of the claim that &quot;a newborn will have deformities traceable to a sickness
<br>
of its mother during pregnancy&quot;, but that doesn't seem right to me at all.
<br>
[Obviously p(deformity) should include cases where there are deformities
<br>
that aren't traceable to a sickness of the mother.]
<br>
<p>Here's my interpretation of the problem.
<br>
<p>p(deformity&amp;traceable) = 0.01
<br>
p(rubella|~deformity) = 0.1
<br>
p(rubella|deformity&amp;traceable) = 0.5
<br>
<p>Where the question is: what's p(deformity|rubella)?
<br>
<p>Now, perhaps I can assume that deformity&amp;rubella entails traceable, but I
<br>
can't just assume that deformity-&gt;traceable.  (And let's not even get into
<br>
the possibility that the child may not be &quot;born healthy and normal&quot; but
<br>
may have no &quot;deformities&quot;.)
<br>
<p>But unless we know p(deformity&amp;~traceable), an obviously non-zero number,
<br>
we can't get p(deformity) or p(~deformity) at all, which we need to get
<br>
p(rubella&amp;~deformity).
<br>
<p>Of course, in light of what they think the answer is, it's obvious that
<br>
they think trivial details like these are irrelevant to the problem;
<br>
perhaps they think my point is a nitpick or something.
<br>
<p>But I'm on Lee's side here... this problem is very badly stated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would (as stated more briefly in my first reply) recommend that you read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the &quot;Intuitive Explanation&quot; from start to finish without skipping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything; and then, if you are still interested in understanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between Bayesians and frequentists (which is something the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intro does not address), I would recommend reading the E.T. Jaynes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lectures given in the &quot;Further Reading&quot; section at the end of the intro.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jaynes gives specific examples of cases where frequentist methods are both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complicated than and inferior to Bayesian methods.
</em><br>
<p>I note here that he has worked out a number of very clear frequentist
<br>
accounts; accounts which don't suffer from as much vagueness as my own,
<br>
but which suffer from their own kinds of problems.
<br>
<p>Note especially section 3.4 and Lecture 5 though his objections against
<br>
frequentism are available througout.
