From: Harvey Newstrom
<br>
...  Sadly, there seems to be a very large and silent contingent that is
<br>
too afraid or too tired to speak up, due to the flamewars and personal
<br>
attacks on the list...
<br>
<p><p><p>Ja, this list is indeed flamey, always has been.  I
<br>
would suggest that it is possible to have totally 
<br>
open and honest discussion of difficult topics while
<br>
maintaining diplomacy, good will and having some fun.  
<br>
We can maintain the spirit of Crocker's rules while
<br>
still being open, diplomatic, kind and honest.
<br>
<p>As a thought experiment, think of the most honest
<br>
never-tell-a-lie person you can imagine, one who is 
<br>
also a kind-hearted soul.  Consider him in a typical
<br>
extropianesque no-win situation, translated
<br>
into an old familiar setting:  &quot;Jesus, do these
<br>
pants make my butt look fat?&quot;  
<br>
<p>Now, he could use my usual technique of feigning an 
<br>
epileptic seizure, but that in itself is a form of 
<br>
dishonesty and they don't fall for it after the 
<br>
fourth time.  It would be perfectly honest for him to 
<br>
answer with a simple &quot;no&quot;, even if he is actually thinking:
<br>
&quot;No, those pants dont make your butt look fat.  Its your
<br>
fat butt that makes your butt look fat.&quot;  Notice
<br>
that a simple &quot;no&quot; is true, is far more diplomatic, 
<br>
spares feelings, follows the spirit of Crocker's rules
<br>
of internet exchange.
<br>
<p>We deal with some difficult topics on this list, but
<br>
I call on people to eschew heated argument in
<br>
favor of controlled argument.  That is really
<br>
the best way for me: Im a lover not a fighter.
<br>
<p>Well, ok, Im not much of a lover either.  But
<br>
while we are practicing a modicum of diplomacy and 
<br>
taking into consideration human emotions, do let us
<br>
remember to have fun, for there is little point
<br>
of extending our lives if we are not having fun.
<br>
Religion Incorporated realized long ago that their 
<br>
memes propagate much more effectively from people 
<br>
that are happy.
<br>
<p>ExI's best days are yet before of us.  Let us
<br>
cut down on rancor and fan the flames of progress.
<br>
We are on the eve of construction.
