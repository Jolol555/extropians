<p>
Bryan Moss, Harvey Newstrom and Mike Lorrey have been making a number of
<br>
good points about taking &quot;action&quot;.  I'd like to follow this up as somebody
<br>
who has made no crucial contributions to the transhumanist movement aside
<br>
from talking... the sort of person about whom many people here have
<br>
complained a great deal.
<br>
<p>To be perfectly frank, the reason I've had a hard time committing myself
<br>
to act on transhumanism in any meaningful way is that I've had an
<br>
extremely hard time figuring out how and why to do that.
<br>
<p>Many people here have already pointed out the problems of deterministic
<br>
optimism; many Marxists (deterministic optimists of a very different
<br>
breed) used to call this the philosophy of the &quot;obstetrician&quot;: if all goes
<br>
as normal, the revolution is inevitable; so all we can do is get ready for
<br>
it.  Get people used to the idea.  Hold hands.  If, by some chance, an
<br>
emergency arises that looks like it's going to threaten the outcome, by
<br>
all means, fix it, if you can.  But other than that, all that's left now
<br>
is cheerleading...  don't knock yourself out over it.
<br>
<p>The Marxists were happy to argue about obstetricianism at length: is this
<br>
attitude a &quot;problem&quot;?  Or is it some kind of &quot;symptom&quot; of some other
<br>
problem?  Is it even wrong?  What would be the alternatives?
<br>
<p>Well, one possible alternative might be called the ascetic approach:
<br>
because the Singularity (or whatever) isn't inevitable, we have to work as
<br>
hard as we possibly can towards making it happen.  If you have any
<br>
time/money, devote it to the Singularity... ALL of it! at least as much as
<br>
you can to the point where devoting any more would make you less able to
<br>
devote more later.
<br>
<p>[But how much later?  Even a mediocre deterministic optimism would suggest
<br>
that some of us, the young ones, already probably have *somewhat* more
<br>
time available than is commonly believed...]
<br>
<p>Eliezer has at least claimed to adopt a position something like this...
<br>
though I note that he still seems to find time to read a few web comics
<br>
every now and again, and perhaps watch a bit of anime.  Still, we have to
<br>
assume that Eliezer and others like him are at least trying to be ascetic;
<br>
maybe they already are at least &quot;maximalist&quot; ascetics if one considers
<br>
one's own present willpower as a limitation which we work to overcome.
<br>
<p>And, of course, aside from that, we'd have to worry about an extremely
<br>
non-extropian alternative: fatalism, here employed in all the negative
<br>
senses.  We're going to die at the normal time [or sooner], no matter what
<br>
we do, so why bother working to overcome it?  Why shouldn't extropians
<br>
just &quot;get over our fear of death&quot; and come to terms with life as it is, as
<br>
some people wish we would?
<br>
<p>So I've just listed three extremist philosophies: fatalism, asceticism and
<br>
obstetrecianism.  Each one advocates a radically different attitude
<br>
towards how we should live our life: fatalism suggests that we all need to
<br>
see therapists immediately, develop a family, and live for today while
<br>
building a legacy as we plan for retirement.  Obstetricianism suggests
<br>
that we plan our lives as if we are already immortal today: invest in the
<br>
extremely long term by taking few risks, acquring lots of money and saving
<br>
it, and advocating the future.  Asceticism tells us to abandon our earthly
<br>
pursuits and to work.  Hard.
<br>
<p><p>As everyone keeps saying, obstetricianism may have seemed more plausible
<br>
in the 90s, but in the last few years it's grown to look pretty dingy.
<br>
And, more to the point, it's unproductive.  Yet, when Bryan says this:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's funny is, a lot of fears could be alleviated if we just admitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how difficult this stuff is.  Designer babies?  Not likely!
</em><br>
<p>as a sort of &quot;antidote&quot; to obstetricianism, I know I can't help but think
<br>
to myself that if he's right, and the ultratechnologies are as &quot;unlikely&quot;
<br>
as he suggests (or even conceptually confused) and that most of it was
<br>
&quot;hype&quot;, asceticism is no way to spend one's life.
<br>
<p>To use Eliezer as an example again, (never merely as a means, I promise,):
<br>
last I checked, Eliezer has no girlfriend and no intention/expectation of
<br>
even seeking one, no job except for pursuing the Singularity, no pleasures
<br>
except for those he takes with some measure of guilt/remorse.  (That
<br>
feeling you get in the back of your throat... I might be having it now as
<br>
I write this.)
<br>
<p>This is all fine if that works... nobody said asceticism would be easy.
<br>
but if the Singularity is &quot;hype&quot;, then an ascetic lifestyle devoted to it
<br>
would be beyond absurd: it would be a tragedy.  Perhaps it would be a
<br>
noble tragedy, if the work of the ascetic laid the groundwork for grand
<br>
improvements in the lives of our descendents, after everyone alive today
<br>
is dead.  But if the ultratechnologies are *just* &quot;hype&quot;, then it wouldn't
<br>
even be that.
<br>
<p>Basically, I've figured out how to be an obstetrician, because it's
<br>
stupidly easy.  Anyone can do it.  But I can't be an ascetic so long as
<br>
there's a better than even chance (from this side of the fence) that I'm
<br>
really an obstetrician or that we're all doomed.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, I work a fulltime job doing stuff unrelated to the
<br>
Singularity (but I'm still young) ... and wait ... and cheerlead.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I hinted at the answer above, but it should seem obvious now what it must
<br>
be: all of the positions I've described are &quot;extreme.&quot;  None of them are
<br>
balanced against the other; all of them are taken to their &quot;logical
<br>
conclusions.&quot;  It's clear that there needs to be a middle ground, a
<br>
sliding scale.  Get used to working part time and perhaps I'll find it
<br>
more fulfilling than I realize; maybe I'll get hooked and become an
<br>
ascetic instead.
<br>
<p>Perhaps my imagination is simply drained, but it's hard to see what kind
<br>
of work I can usefully do in my free time, to contribute to the
<br>
ultratechnologies.  Bryan was completely right when he said that they
<br>
&quot;cast a vast, ominous shadow over any attempt at practical action.&quot;  For
<br>
example, I respect the Free State Project, but it's a rather long shot
<br>
that it'd bring the Singularity much closer.  It's a lot easier for me to
<br>
imagine ascetic life paths than it is for me to think of a way to usefully
<br>
contribute in my spare time.
<br>
<p>I have sent a few extra dollars to ExI, and the Singularity Institute...
<br>
I just sent a few more as I think about it.  But it's not the same.
<br>
<p>Hopefully, I'm just not clever enough to see the other options.  Any
<br>
suggestions?
