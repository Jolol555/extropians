<em>&gt; I'm interested in feedback on this line of reasoning:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a trait which has a 0.5 heritability.  That is to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's a 0.5 correlation between the trait and one's genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Specifically, let's use IQ.  Estimates of the genetic component of IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vary, but 0.5 is not an unreasonable number.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now let's imagine you wish to bring into this world children with high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQs.  Using the DNA of someone known to have a high IQ, you create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of clones.  In this case, let's pick Albert Einstein as the DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; donor.  And let's posit that his IQ was 160.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alternately, if science has identified every IQ-affecting gene (hah!),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you may start with any human embryos and modify their IQ-related genes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to match Einstein's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are my suppositions about this thought experiment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) We do not know the relative contribution of genes and environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Einstein's high IQ.  In the absence of such specific knowledge, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best choice is to use the statistical contribution of genes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment across the population.  The 0.5 heritability in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population would suggest that half of Einstein's deviation from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; norm in IQ was due to his deviation from typical human genes, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other half was due to environmental effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) If we created many children who shared Einstein's IQ-related genes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and raised them in average environments (or a set of environments with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a distribution mirroring the social average), then we'd expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average IQ of such children to be 130.
</em><br>
<p>### Well, not necessarily - if the genetic contribution to our particular
<br>
Einstein's IQ minus average IQ was different from .5, then the mean of the
<br>
clones' IQ would differ from 130. Say, he was a really, really genetically
<br>
smart guy, but his particular environment stimulated his development less
<br>
than average, then you could get a population of clones with average IQ 150.
<br>
<p>It's a bit tricky to apply regression to the mean to a single person,
<br>
although if you apply it to a population of IQ 160 donors, you indeed get
<br>
the results you describe.
<br>
-----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) The distribution of IQs of these children would form a normal bell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curve centered on 130.
</em><br>
<p>### A normal distribution, yes.
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) The standard deviation of their IQs would be 10 points. (I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly interested in feedback on this point.  Would the standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deviation remain 10 points given that the genetic contributor to IQ is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixed?)
</em><br>
<p>### The SD of most IQ tests (WAIS) is usually 15 with a mean of 100. The SD
<br>
would be reduced because of removal of the genetic component of variance.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) As an extension of point 3, as many of these children would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQs of 100 (dead average) as would have IQs of 160 (Einstein)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Yes, with qualifications as in 1).
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Point 5, to me, is a pretty unexpected conclusion.  But it seems be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable consequence of a 0.5 heritability of IQ, and the guess that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Einstein's deviation from the norm in particular was 50% accounted for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by genetics and 50% by environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>### Buying gametes from an IQ 160 donor will give your offspring only about
<br>
11 IQ points over average, they say. Yes, IQ is a finicky trait.
