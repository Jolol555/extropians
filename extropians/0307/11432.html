</em><br>
<p>I think that may be a little oversimplified.
<br>
<p>I suspect that many people consider &quot;biomass&quot; to be the
<br>
mass in a &quot;living organism&quot; -- but if you consider where
<br>
most of the mass is (probably in trees) it is cellulose
<br>
and lignin -- technically not &quot;living&quot; at all -- but an
<br>
accumulated store of &quot;organic carbon&quot;.  Though most people
<br>
for energy production purposes classify &quot;dead wood&quot; as
<br>
&quot;biomass&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, with respect to the soil.  I (a) question the numbers
<br>
in the reference cited by Hal
<br>
<a href="http://www.icsu-scope.org/downloadpubs/scope13/index.html">http://www.icsu-scope.org/downloadpubs/scope13/index.html</a>
<br>
because it was published in 1979 and I think we have learned
<br>
a fair amount about the global carbon cycle since then.
<br>
But assuming that it is accurate, Hal's statements may be
<br>
somewhat misleading.  Why?  Because Table 1.1 seems to point
<br>
out that the amount of carbon (inorganic) in the oceans
<br>
is an order of magnitude greater than the amount of carbon
<br>
on land or in the soil, or present as organic matter in
<br>
the oceans.  (Of course these numbers are subject to revision
<br>
given my post of the Science News article the other day
<br>
indicating that scientists haven't previously looked for
<br>
bacteriophage quantities previously.)
<br>
<p>But the number that *really* skews things is the amount of
<br>
carbon in sediments -- which seems to be ~3-4 orders of
<br>
magnitude larger than those present in other sources.
<br>
<p>The question *then* becomes how much of the carbon in
<br>
sediments is &quot;inorganic&quot; (effectively graphite or coal?),
<br>
how much is &quot;organic&quot; (oil, peat, leaves or their decay
<br>
products, etc.) and how much is living material (primarily
<br>
bacteriophages [if you stretch the definition of &quot;living&quot;],
<br>
bacteria (mostly anaerobic), and perhaps a small fraction
<br>
of multicellular organisms (nematodes, etc.))].
<br>
<p>Now, the organic carbon that is &quot;living&quot; material is probably
<br>
not classified as &quot;biomass&quot; for energy production purposes
<br>
(though peat might be).  On the other hand for for ecological
<br>
purposes and global carbon cycle purposes one probably includes
<br>
much of the carbon in the process of converting from living
<br>
to organic to inorganic in the quantification of &quot;biomass&quot;.
<br>
<p>So there are some real problems with the question as Amara
<br>
posed it in that I think the definitions of &quot;biomass&quot; (and
<br>
&quot;living&quot;) are very context sensitive from a scientific viewpoint.
<br>
Inorganic and organic are fairly well defined.  But as the diagrams
<br>
in chapter 1 of the ref. cited above point out the global carbon
<br>
cycles are *very* complex (and still being worked out 20+ years later).
<br>
<p>So Amara, if you want a good answer to the question I think you need to
<br>
refine the definitions a bit.  For example with respect to the &quot;depletion&quot;
<br>
aspect -- burning of rain forest increases the atmospheric CO2
<br>
concentration which then further increases the oceanic CO2 concentration
<br>
(global warming, if it increases storm activity/rainfall, may also assist
<br>
in this process) [anything that increases the amount of water surface area
<br>
exposed to air will increase the rate at which CO2 disolves into the
<br>
water].  Increasing the oceanic CO2 concentration probably increases net
<br>
biomass production in the oceans (which may offset the losses on land) --
<br>
but there are other limiting nutrients as well such as iron and
<br>
phosphorus.  The raping of the oceans of biomass (in the form of human
<br>
consumed species) probably allows a greater fraction of the oceanic carbon
<br>
to remain in the form of smaller organisms (e.g. photosynthetic bacteria).
<br>
The phages attack them resulting in the release of their organic material
<br>
then rains to the bottom of the oceans and accumulates in the sediments.
<br>
That may get released in part as methane gas by the bacteria most of which
<br>
probably ends up as methane clathrates.  Some of the organic material
<br>
and/or bacteria in the sediments will get slowly converted into oil or coal.
<br>
Some will also eventually get subducted and released as CO2 from volcanoes.
<br>
[But one might be able to make a reasonable argument that an increase in
<br>
oceanic bacteria supports a larger mass of oceanic biomass that is eventually
<br>
consumed by humans and respired as atmospheric CO2...]
<br>
<p>I wouldn't put very much money on statements by scientists that they
<br>
*really* understand these cycles completely yet (obviously human
<br>
interventions, e.g.  everything from oil consumption to fishing are
<br>
changing them so they are going after a moving target).
