<p><em>&gt;&gt; That IQ is heritable doesn't mean you can get the benefits of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligence to reproduce across generations easily. 
</em><br>
<p>We're not really talking about inheriting IQ as from father to son but
<br>
cloning it.
<br>
If intelligence is anyway contributed to by recessive genes it would be
<br>
diluted in 
<br>
A statistical study where it would not appear every generation.  Or
<br>
maybe genius is a 
<br>
mutation in which case cloning would be the only way to reproduce it.
<br>
<p>Also when both parents highly intelligent they tend to be both be
<br>
employed and spoil
<br>
the children with material things but don't necessarily have the time
<br>
out of their busy
<br>
schedule to devote to empasizing their education especially if little
<br>
Johny is getting 
<br>
A's and is still only using half his potential.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Sure. It would likely help most of them most of the time. There is
</em><br>
also 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a very real risk of them running into the usual problems gifted
</em><br>
children 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have with overambitious parents trying to foist destiny on them, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this case not just &quot;make mommy happy&quot; but &quot;save humanity!&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>Psychological counselors would provide guidance and ensure that children
<br>
were not pushed
<br>
to the point that they had high amounts of stress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But look at the big names in history (selected by the importance of
</em><br>
their 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; contributions) and try to see how many of them had enriched
</em><br>
upbringings. 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You will see that most of them had entirely ordinary upbringings of
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; time - Pasteur, Newton, Einstein, Edison and so on. There might be a
</em><br>
larger 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incidence of enriched upbringings than in the population at large,
</em><br>
but if 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you do the math you will see that increasing the number of good
</em><br>
upbringings 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of people with good genes with 20 does not produce a large number of
</em><br>
geniuses:
<br>
<p>Exactly my point what would these individual have produced if they had
<br>
been given 
<br>
the best training and every advantage?  How many more geniuses get
<br>
buried in the 
<br>
school system told they're poor students like Einstein and Edison were,
<br>
and never
<br>
realize their true potential.  For every Einstein and Edison we realized
<br>
we may have 
<br>
thrown 10 away!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Assume one genius per 100 million people (this could be regarded as a
</em><br>
definition 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of a genius): P(genius) = 10^-8. Assume normally one in a thousand
</em><br>
gets a really 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; good upbringing: P(upbringing)=10^-3.  Assume a good upbringing
</em><br>
increases the 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; likeliehood of being a genius a hundredfold. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree with with your math at this point.  This shows how rare the
<br>
probability would be 
<br>
to have a genious reach his/her maximum potential naturally.  
<br>
<p>Since we are taking a genetic copy though and giving it good upbringing
<br>
and optimal environment.
<br>
<p>I say that the probability that the genius will exceed the capabilities
<br>
of the 
<br>
original person from which the DNA was donated is 100%.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Maybe they will explain to the project leaders that the whole idea of
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; the singularity is bunk? 
</em><br>
<p>I doubt this would happen but even if they felt that way it does not
<br>
matter so long
<br>
As they contributed their genius to mankind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The problem with real transformative genius is that it is creative
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; produces something entirely unexpected. While I approve of nurturing
</em><br>
it, 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't think it can be nurtured with a specific goal in mind. If you
</em><br>
by 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; singularity mean &quot;general human progress&quot; then I might regard the aim
</em><br>
of 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your project as valid (even if I disagree on the means), but it may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very well be that these children advance it by becoming great
</em><br>
writers, 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; theologicians or revolutionaries. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree that we can not anticipate what these individuals would choose
<br>
to contribute.  We can
<br>
only hope that they are disruptive technologies and that they would
<br>
significantly advance us forward.
<br>
With an education that emphasized technology and sciences though would
<br>
be nudging them in the right direction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You have never heard of Kantian ethics, have you?
</em><br>
<p>While ethics are all well and good.  They don't do a lot for us if every
<br>
madman on the block can engineer a doomsday virus or when millions are
<br>
dieing from disease and starvation.  We are not dooming the children to
<br>
miserable live on the contrary they will have the best life has to
<br>
offer.  If this violates some tenet of transhumanism but helps our
<br>
planet to survive, I will gladly accept that transgression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The myth of the lone genius as the necessary and sufficient condition
</em><br>
of 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; progress is popular. But it isn't very true, and policies based on it
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; can waste much effort and resources on infinitesimal gains. 
</em><br>
<p>How can you place a price on five Einsteins or five Teslas?  The
<br>
knowledge of math, computer
<br>
science, biotech, and physics it will take to solve the worlds most
<br>
pressing problems disease,
<br>
cheap energy, and protecting ourselves from terrorists may be beyond our
<br>
capability without them.
