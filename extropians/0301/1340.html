<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So far Bush is doing a very poor job convincing anybody that he is
</em><br>
morally
<br>
<em>&gt; right in attacking Irak. Especially the arab countries are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced it is all just a ploy to get cheap oil. Exactly the situation
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; turned Osama and many other arabs against the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; USA. So how can that be a long term solution?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that Sadam is a murderous racist tyrant despotic dictator is
</em><br>
moral
<br>
<em>&gt; justification enough.  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;With no or little consequences and death to only him and his direct guard
<br>
and troops that *might* be enough.  But this is far from the case.&quot;
<br>
<p>So because you feel 'innocents' might be killed, we should do nothing about
<br>
Sadam?  What about the innocents slaughtered by his murderous tyranny?  As I
<br>
noted to Kai, I would be interested in hearing some alternative and viable
<br>
methods of dealing with Saddam from the Anti-War side besides 'war bad, war
<br>
bad'  
<br>
<p>So we can not attack IRAQ unless we only kill or remove him and his direct
<br>
guard and troops.  What about his Son?  What about his supporters?  What
<br>
about his political leadership and infrastructure?  What about the soliders
<br>
standing in his way, shall we politley ask them to step out of the way?
<br>
What about his aresnal?   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that Europeans do not find this as a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification is a testament to the liberalized moral relativist notions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevalent in Europe at the moment.  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This is nothing but empty rhetoric.&quot;
<br>
<p>Your following response demonstates otherwise.  
<br>
<p>&quot;The latest polls show that 70% of the American people believe we should not
<br>
use military means at this time, that we should give more time to
<br>
inspections and diplomatic means.  Of course you can make your empty
<br>
accusations against them also.  But at some point you really need to notice
<br>
that a great deal of the world and of US people do not believe this is the
<br>
correct course of action.  Call them whatever names you will, the numbers
<br>
are against you.&quot;
<br>
<p>A great deal of people in the world think that thier feelings could manage
<br>
to alter the course of a single spec of dust in the universe, believe that
<br>
stars tell their futures, and drinking urine in the morning is healthy.  As
<br>
the numbers were also 'anti war' the vietnam era, and that cost the lives of
<br>
3 million indochinese people, I must appeal to the fallacy of logic known as
<br>
argumentum ad populum, just because more people say something, doesn't make
<br>
it more likely to be right.  This same majority of people (such as yourself)
<br>
think its ok that 3 million indochinese people were murdered by an
<br>
expansionistic communist regime.  I don't think it was ok, but does the fact
<br>
that more people think it was actually make it ok?  This is the fundamental
<br>
basis for moral relativism, it is an appaling, irrational, and ultimately
<br>
deadly  appeal to make.  I don't care how many people say its ok to murder
<br>
and slaughter 3 million people, or that it was 'senselless' to try to stop
<br>
such an attrocity, it still is wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also seem to be oblivious of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that this murderous racist tyrant also controls the worlds second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest supply of the cheapest and dense sources of energy in the world,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; surprisingly he has used it for murder and tyranny.  This is NOT about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'cheap' oil so evil oil companies can profit, its about getting the
</em><br>
cheapest
<br>
<em>&gt; most plentiful source of energy, in fact the second largest depository of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, out of the hands of a murderous despotic tyrant.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;He hasn't been able to do much of squat with that oil for the last decade
<br>
in case you missed it.&quot;
<br>
<p>What do you think his military industrial base runs on, solar power?  Oh
<br>
wait, you did say 'last decade' was that specifically so I couldn't site his
<br>
fossil fuel burning war machines that were used to invade kuwait?
<br>
<p>&quot;There are many murderous despotic tyrants in the world.  Why do we go after
<br>
this one in particular at this time? Are you sure oil and positioning US
<br>
forces don't have at least something to do with it?&quot;
<br>
<p>The same as Kai's &quot;There are other morally less just military actions to
<br>
take, since we havent taken them, I will not support this one, which is more
<br>
morally just&quot;  Consider what you are saying, Sadam is a known murderous
<br>
tyrant, west hating, oppressor, racist, AND controls the worlds second
<br>
largest oil supply.  That's a lot of strikes against him, not to mention he
<br>
has or is attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction.  Of the
<br>
countries Kai mentioned &quot;Chile, Argentina, Nicaragua, Iran&quot; which of these
<br>
also shares *all* these strikes?  Is Chili West hating?  Is it racist?  Does
<br>
it have weapons of mass destruction?  Did it use weapons of mass destruction
<br>
on its own people?  Does it control the worlds second largest oil supply?
