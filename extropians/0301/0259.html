<p><em>    &gt; John, your comment was facetious.
</em><br>
<p>Yea I admit it, that's true;
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;You're not genuinely interested in anything I have to say.
</em><br>
<p>But that's not true.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I have no strong feelings about communism one way or
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the other.
</em><br>
<p>Then you suffer from a serious moral blindness because you should have
<br>
strong feelings about a system that murdered many millions of people and
<br>
brought misery to billions more, you should have very strong feelings
<br>
indeed.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I don't blame communism for Stalin
</em><br>
<p>Ok, you are not impressed that in the 30's Stalin murdered millions of his
<br>
own people but what about the 20's when Lenin forced people to abandon their
<br>
private farms and go to huge corrupt monumentally inefficient collective
<br>
farms with the result that millions died of starvation.  Ok, you shrug that
<br>
off with a wave of you hand but what about the 50's when Mao did the exact
<br>
same stupid thing in China in the name of communism and at least 30 million
<br>
ended up dead, or how about the 70's in Cambodia where the communists
<br>
murdered a greater percentage of their population than any regime in the
<br>
history of the world. Ok, maybe all that is ancient history to you but how
<br>
about the 90's in North Korea, a nightmare country as bad as anything
<br>
George Orwell could dream up, caused two million to starve to death while
<br>
South Korea, a country with the same culture and language but without
<br>
communism became a would economic powerhouse. Exactly what would
<br>
it take for you to blame communism for anything?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;any more than I blame the Spanish Inquisition on Jesus.
</em><br>
<p>Well, why don't you blame Jesus? First of all the man thought he was God and
<br>
so was clearly insane, second he had no tolerance for those who disagreed
<br>
with him even slightly, for example &quot;You serpents, you generation of vipers,
<br>
how can you escape the damnation of hell&quot;.  I can't see Buddha, Lao-tse,
<br>
or even Socrates saying something like that, they had a more enlightened
<br>
attitude toward those who disagreed with them, and they had it 500 years
<br>
before Jesus.
<br>
<p>Far worse was the fact that Christ believed in hell. He talked with glee
<br>
about &quot;wailing and gnashing of teeth&quot; and &quot;these shall go away into
<br>
everlasting fire&quot;. He thought that torturing somebody not for a billion
<br>
years but for an INFINITE number of years, would be an amusing thing
<br>
to do to somebody he didn't like. I think cruelty on this monstrous scale
<br>
shows that Christ of the bible is morally indistinguishable from Satin
<br>
of the bible.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The idea of  voting as a means of confirming that consent seems to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; me feasible and equitable.
</em><br>
<p>Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of communicating your wishes, there are
<br>
much better ways. Every day I send hundreds of exquisitely precise messages
<br>
to the Free Market telling it what I want it to do. I also get to compare
<br>
brands, I can't do that In a democracy because I'm not voting for goods or
<br>
services or even policies, I just get to choose between two grab bags of
<br>
promises every 4 years.
<br>
<p>When I &quot;vote&quot; in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I
<br>
always win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any
<br>
rate, the chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's
<br>
not worth my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the
<br>
politician with the best hairdo gets to make the decisions.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but at last was
<br>
&nbsp;complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have
<br>
&nbsp;never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion
<br>
&nbsp;was correct. I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish
<br>
&nbsp;Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text
<br>
&nbsp;seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would
<br>
&nbsp;include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be
<br>
&nbsp;everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine.&quot; - Charles Darwin
