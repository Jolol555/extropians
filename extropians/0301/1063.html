<p>Right.  The point of the non-sequitur about blind guitar
<br>
players was to urge us to assume the proper humility when
<br>
handling this difficult subject.  This I ask of all sides.
<br>
<p>Over the past several weeks, I have quietly listened to
<br>
opinions of neighbors, friends, officemates, the extropians,
<br>
etc.  We have the usual collection of hawks, undecideds,
<br>
those who who went to the peace marches over the weekend,
<br>
etc.  After I posted, Damien made a comment more eloquent
<br>
that I can manage, asking (paraphrase) if this is the best
<br>
that *smart* people can do, what will happen a few years down
<br>
the road when the world faces military nanotech, AI, etc.
<br>
<p>Please let us take a step back and look at the big picture.
<br>
This conflict between the US, Iraq and North Korea is about
<br>
the development of nuclear weapons.  In the long run, anyone
<br>
can see that if every hungry nation on earth has nukes, it
<br>
really is only a matter of time before they are used, and
<br>
all our fondest dreams go up in radioactive smoke.
<br>
<p>In the big picture, and in the long run, do we not face
<br>
the necessity of somehow ridding the entire planet of all
<br>
nukes and all weapons of mass destruction?  How, how, how
<br>
in the hell are we going to accomplish that?
