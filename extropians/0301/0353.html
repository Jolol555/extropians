<em>&gt;From: &quot;Nathanael Allison&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:jubungalord@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Dominant%20Societies">jubungalord@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are creative thoughts just random occurances?
</em><br>
No, they are determined by a number of factors, and are limited by the 
<br>
constraints of the physical environment; we cannot be creative about 
<br>
something that the environment doesn't influence us to create. In other 
<br>
words, we literally cannot think out of the box.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If so than memes are just random occurances?
</em><br>
<p>No, they are not random. They are mostly the result of rational cognition 
<br>
and observations. But like natural selection, the propogation of memes are 
<br>
subject to non-random influences (eg. a good idea, or a meme that appeals to 
<br>
an individual who is prone to want to pass that idea along the chain).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Assuming that all humans have creative ability and are creative is there a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible measurment of creativity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seems that certain people have more ability to connect seperate thoughts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;together? Isn't this what we assume intelligence is?
</em><br>
<p>The measure of creativity would essentially be a metric that gauges the 
<br>
quality and efficiency of a person's (or group's) ability to construct 
<br>
things that lack a hard precursor. Thus, to a degree, I would associate a 
<br>
certain amount of creativity with intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(My dominant societies theory may have just been a natural random occurance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of creative thought? or was it a reaction to some enviromental stimulus?)
</em><br>
<p>I think your thesis is an interesting one, and I strongly suggest you look 
<br>
up Jared Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies.&quot; 
<br>
He comes up with a number of theories that explain why some societies do 
<br>
better than others, including geography, access to resources, and most 
<br>
importantly, access to data. He shows quite convincingly that the most 
<br>
successful and creative societies in history were those that interacted 
<br>
regularly and openly with neighboring societies and exchanged information 
<br>
and technologies.
