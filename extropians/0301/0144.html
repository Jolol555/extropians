<p><em>&gt; [My] analysis predisposes a notion of identity similar to what

</em><br>
<p>Why, I had always suspected that this had happened!  When God
<br>
was assigning souls, Hal was supposed to get #131,214,226,110
<br>
and George Bush #131,241,226,110, but there was a stupid mix-up
<br>
at the factory.  Sorry you got the rotten deal, and that that
<br>
Hal Finney type got to be president.
<br>
<p>This must be so, because the Soul ID# is the only other thing
<br>
not included in the genetics and environment.  Right?
<br>
<p>But Hal more than makes up for this gaffe with
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin asks, in another thread,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What is bad about Dolly's arthritis?  Who is it bad for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Would it have been better for Dolly if cloning had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forbidden?  Would Dolly be better off dead?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; First, while I think there may be people and animals who are better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off dead, I think that would mostly apply only in extreme cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If someone is in terrible, constant, unrelievable pain, they might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better off dead.  But just having arthritis or diabetes or some other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sickness that limits quality of life would not be enough to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone is better off dead.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, thank you for the clear statement of WHAT SHOULD BE COMMON SENSE
<br>
VALUES FOR EVERYONE.  (Sorry, but this is a little exasperating.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, it's possible that Dolly had another alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Her choices were not between being born defective and not being born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.  From a certain perspective, Dolly might have been born whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and well.
</em><br>
<p>Good point.  I had forgotten that for an animal, as opposed
<br>
to a human being, identities are not nearly so individual.
<br>
For example, we universalist immortalists wish to use technology
<br>
if it becomes available to go back and resurrect every human
<br>
being who ever lived.  Why not?  But animals?  When you've
<br>
brought back one goldfish, you might very well have brought
<br>
back them all.
<br>
<p>So I may be willing to concede that Dolly, especially as a clone
<br>
but perhaps just as a member of a particular kind of sheep, is
<br>
only getting additional run time by being cloned, and is not
<br>
a separate individual rescued from non-existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The obvious difficulty with this perspective is that it raises the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of who is Dolly?  How much of her life circumstances could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be changed while still allowing us to think of her as the same person?
</em><br>
<p>I suggest that the answer may be different for animals than for
<br>
people, accepting that it's of course all a continuum anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Conventionally we draw a line and say that minor changes would preserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity - if I had had a different breakfast today, I would be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same person.  But sufficiently large changes would commonly be said to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change this - I would have been a different person if I had been adopted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or if I had a different set of siblings.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, since identical twins are found by the people who
<br>
know them to be different people---something that would
<br>
not be true of me and my duplicate---then we should say
<br>
that such early influences would for sure have made you
<br>
someone else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However for some purposes we need to adopt a more inclusive position where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even large changes can be considered to preserve identity.  From this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of view, the name is like a label or token which would apply to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different entity in each possible world.
</em><br>
<p>Here you (and perhaps Robin) have completely lost me.
<br>
This sort of identity is very cheap.  We re-label the
<br>
actual entities, or in computer-speak, create other
<br>
pointers to them.  So if in the Bronx there is another
<br>
Lee Corbin, who even has my social security number due
<br>
to a snafu, and is often confused by people with me,
<br>
it does NOT change the reality in any way.  How can
<br>
you suggest this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As long as we can come up with a consistent naming scheme that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applies the labels to entities across the worlds, we can consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entities carrying that name to be the same identity.
</em><br>
<p>How positively weird.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We saw some examples of this in our discussion of some of Robin Hanson's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;agree to disagree&quot; economic results a few years ago.  Part of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning required considering the possibility that pairs of individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were born with circumstances and predispositions exchanged, in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyze rationally when people should disagree.  This analysis predisposes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a notion of identity similar to what I have described above, where I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider what might have happened if I had been born as, say, George Bush,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with his genetics and upbringing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps some peculiar economic argument might be
<br>
advanced by these suppositions---one does in fact find
<br>
that many times clear and absurd simplifications allow
<br>
new insights or are computationally expedient, but this
<br>
doesn't so far seem to have any applicability here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So we can disapprove of Dolly's creation without necessarily saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she would have been better off dead.  We could say that she would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been better off healthy.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yes, right.  Exactly so!  In another thread I described a
<br>
preference relation &quot;&gt;&quot; and suggested something similar to
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healthy &gt; unhealthy &gt; null
<br>
<p>which I think made the distinctions clearer for some people.
<br>
Sometimes mathematical notation, besides inveigling us to
<br>
give something greater credence than it deserves, can also
<br>
simplify main ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question remains though as to whether any sheep would have been born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take Dolly's place if she had not been cloned.  And this arises even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more for human cloning, where at least in the early days the technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems likely to be applied mostly in cases where people are unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reproduce otherwise.  If the alternative to the cloning is to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one born, human or sheep, then we really are back to the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raised by Lee, where you have to claim that the clone is better off dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to condemn their birth.
</em><br>
<p>You seem inarguably right on this point.  How can people want
<br>
to deny having offspring to people who won't be able to obtain
<br>
them?  HOW CAN THEY BE SO DAMNED INVASIVE AND MEDDLING ANYWAY?
<br>
sorry
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Summing up, if cloning allows for more people to be born than would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible otherwise, it is hard to object unless the clones' lives are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so terrible that they all commit suicide as soon as possible to end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their agonizing existence.  But if there are alternatives to cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that still allow just as many people to be born (including adoption of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy babies birthed by others), then we could say that the cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is wrong if it creates people who are less healthy than would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been born in the alternative.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's so.  But we don't know for sure that such a tradeoff
<br>
would materialize, and it may indeed be that cloning is a positive
<br>
gain in the number of people.  Besides, the technology must of
<br>
course be opened up in order that we explore the future.  Not to
<br>
rant again about the nasty, stupid, hyper-cautious, restrictive,
<br>
freedom-denying, meddling passage of new laws!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At this point it looks to me like the second circumstance holds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cloning will not substantially increase the number of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings in the world, so this suggests that it is proper to condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning if it leads to unhealthy babies.
</em><br>
<p>Why wouldn't a mature cloning technology substantially
<br>
increase the number of people?  Why, I myself would go
<br>
get two or three new clones of me alone.  Besides, the
<br>
&quot;unhealthy babies&quot; will be a mere transition effect,
<br>
not to be even significant at all in comparison to the
<br>
years of delay of the advent of millions.  Moreover,
<br>
you yourself gave excellent arguments that these 
<br>
relatively unhealthy babies are THEMSELVES better off
<br>
in most cases.  As for the other cases, there is always
<br>
youth in Asia.
