<p>There is a contradiction here, which I acknowledge. Sorry. My error.
<br>
<p>I got carried away and forgot context. I did use the word &quot;necessity&quot;, and
<br>
I hereby retract that as convenient shorthand, due to parallel construction
<br>
in congruity with the writing of my correspondent. Sloppy of me.
<br>
<p>What I should have said was something like:
<br>
<p>&quot;Independent of any personal psychological value which such a belief might
<br>
have had for proponents of what they called 'natural and God-given rights',
<br>
there was significant value in their framing their speech in such a way while
<br>
promoting their goals, given the entrenched and monopolistically-violent
<br>
opposition they faced which justified its suzerainty, sometimes for
<br>
_all eternity_, in like terms.&quot; Had they not, they likely would have been
<br>
called &quot;Godless&quot;, and that was serious mud to be slinging back in the day.
<br>
<p>This probably puts me at or over my 8 post limit.
