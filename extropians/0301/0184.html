</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; which you cite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; at the top, looks identical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree. And I feel like a newbie again swimming in data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I read the post in the subject header for the first time this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morning and liked it because I thought it was provocative and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mistakenly thought it was new. The misreference to Daisy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clone had me perplexed though, I didn't recall any Daisy, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've followed that area reasonably closely, and read Wilmut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; et als book &quot;The Second Creation&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyway, having gotten all excited about the possibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some genuinely thorough and constructive analysis I find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; material been gone over and therefore probably some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fiercer minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be reluctant to take it up again. What a bummer!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I just read the link Greg refers to (above top), not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forensically, but close enough I think. I have to say, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather choose to say, (as a relative newbie to both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism and Extropian thought) it is *still* my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suspicion that there is much in Toth-Fejel's criticisms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could be &quot;valuably&quot; considered. That's a vague statement I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know but I'm wrestling now in part with the bandwidth of the medium. .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unlike Greg Burch, I saw Toth-Fejels comments on first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impression as constructive and coming from an independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinker and ally not an opponent. I thought, &quot;Great! There's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing like criticism to make a good thing better.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For the record Greg, (having now read your Dialogue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Concerning Transhumanist and Extropian Ethics) I'm with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the theist/atheist dimension (unless you've changed your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mind) but I don't think any,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correction all, of Toth-Fejels points, or anyone else's, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are so well put together, can be summarily dismissed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose I might have sheathed my rhetorical claws a little more, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensed more negativity toward &quot;the transhumanist/Extropian tradition&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entirety of Toth-Fejel's piece than any particular point he made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reveals. This comes mainly from two items in his post.  First is &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazi move&quot; -- Having had my nose poked into transhumanism per se for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade (and far longer, without that label), I tire quickly of &quot;the Nazi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gambit&quot; when discussing human augmentation.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately I am certain ExI hasn't seen the last of it. The Nazi card is
<br>
all too easy to play. In the recent Australian stem cell debate even
<br>
the Deputy Prime Minister played it. I agree with Shermer in the recent
<br>
article posted to this list. We are going to see the same arguments from
<br>
the same folk over and over. Cloning. Stem Cell research. Genetic
<br>
engineering. (And these things have the prospect of positively impacting
<br>
millions of lives by removing diseases let alone doing any functional
<br>
enhancements). And so we are going to have to answer the arguments
<br>
over and over or the turkeys will win by shear weight of numbers. I think
<br>
from the standpoint of defending and propagating the memes its important
<br>
to be ready for the Nazi card. And the don't play God card. Newcomers
<br>
to a group don't all come in through the same portal so they don't all get
<br>
the same induction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I find that it's almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always not the expression of a thought-out analysis of questions raised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by transhumanist technologies, but rather is either a simple emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction or, worse yet, a conscious rhetorical ploy.  After all this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, when I sense &quot;the Nazi gambit,&quot; I scramble all fighters and smoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as many of the enemy's planes as I can.
</em><br>
<p>Completely understand the sentiment. A Indian or Pakistani woman came
<br>
to my door once ostensibly collecting for charity. (Actually, in hindsight,
<br>
I'm
<br>
pretty sure she was collecting for a worthwhile charity as she saw it). But
<br>
she was also wearing a badge which I &quot;recognized&quot; as a swastika and I was
<br>
all ready to &quot;smoke&quot; the &quot;enemy plane&quot; too. As it turned out, unbeknown to
<br>
me at the time, the swastika symbol, had another older usage. The woman
<br>
certainly got a less cordial welcome than the curt but polite response I
<br>
usually
<br>
reserve for unsolicited door to door sales types.
<br>
<p>Who was the clown here?R Me for assuming a swastika means a Nazi, or
<br>
her for not knowing that the association would likely be made in many cases
<br>
and the badge should have stayed out of the &quot;first impression&quot;?R
<br>
<p>Maybe both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, it bothered me that Toth-Fejel quoted the Transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principles and not the Extropian Principles, and also gave little (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most cases) or no (in others) credit to the significant amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought that's already gone into the questions he raised.  It's one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, like Fukuyama apparently recently has, to &quot;discover&quot; the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of transhumanism and be shaken by the implications, but not to be aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there's a group of really bright people who have been thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about these issues in depth for a long time.
</em><br>
<p>The media can suck and it has its own agenda and drivers. Reporters can
<br>
be completely self serving in the way they write their articles. Sensation
<br>
sells. Nothing new there.
<br>
<p>Seriously though, whose responsibility do you think it is to propagate
<br>
one set of memes or one particular &quot;brand&quot; in a competitive world?R
<br>
<p>In democracies we all have the burden of making our cases. If we get
<br>
tired, if we cease to be effective that understandable, that's natural,
<br>
but that's not going to win us any great concessions or sympathy from
<br>
the people who have yet to be persuaded they should care. My point is
<br>
we (and I do mean we as I consider myself an extropian) cannot assume
<br>
the message we want to send will go out as fast or as effectively as we
<br>
would like just because we would like it to. (Apologies for telling
<br>
you how to suck eggs I'm sure *you* know, but there are others
<br>
listening. That's a key point in political activism, there are almost always
<br>
more people listening on the sidelines quietly than talking.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It's quite another to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done enough research to come across Anders' web site and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanist Principles, but to still take the rhetorical position that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these Big Questions Need to be Addressed -- as if the author is a lone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voice sounding the alarm in the wilderness.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't matter that he wasn't, imo, it matters that he *looked* like he
<br>
was asking the sort of questions a lot of people would reasonably have
<br>
asked. In the court of public opinion and in the parliament recently we
<br>
did not get to attack or dismiss the arguments of everyone who was
<br>
opposed to using spare IVF embryos for research just because they
<br>
derived their views from a particular religious tradition (or interpretation
<br>
thereof) because we had to *be seen* to be playing the arguments not
<br>
the arguers.  They on the otherhand got to take lots of cheap shots,
<br>
and do lots of slandering using parliamentary privilege because as it
<br>
happens the worldview they were purporting to represent is a popular
<br>
one and many who don't have a view of their own go for the popular
<br>
by default.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This was one of the things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that bothered me so much about Bill Joy's alarmism.  In this regard,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Toth-Fejel's piece exhibits just a pale shadow of the problems Joy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jeremiad had: &quot;Oh no!
</em><br>
<p>There will be opportunities aplenty for folk who want to make a fast
<br>
buck or a quick reputation knocking what to the majority of the public
<br>
is at least a little beyond their ken. Again, for us, stiff, its adapt,
<br>
prepare,
<br>
plan or die.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We're about to be able to change HUMAN NATURE!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Better be careful!&quot;  Taking the issues seriously on the one hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without acknowledging and dressing the existing literature on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject on the other hand, seems to me to be disrespectful of the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who've devoted themselves to these questions at worst and superficial at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best.  Thus, Toth-Fejel's article triggered in me a desire to set the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; record straight and let his readers know that there was a large body of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing literature addressing the questions he raised.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A last point also probably played a role in my reaction to Toth-Fejel's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article way back when.  When I read it, I did a little research on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; author and discovered that he is a devout Catholic.
</em><br>
<p>This *would* have effected me too. And in one-on-one its good to know when
<br>
one is wasting ones time or that another agenda's is being worked.
<br>
But in a public forum, it is what is said and hear by the *observers* and
<br>
what goes into *the record* that more often matters. The opponents agenda
<br>
is largely irrelevant other than knowing it can help one plan better and
<br>
thereby help one achieve ones own objects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  That's fine and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business, of course, but learning that made me question the sincerity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tone in the article in question.  How can someone who holds the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs he does address the subject of the fundamental re-engineering of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human nature without mentioning the Big Guy in the Sky?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think *he* would have characterised the meeting as about
<br>
addressing the subject of the fundamental re-engineering of human
<br>
nature, (although that was a part of it). His final questing was more
<br>
on his mind I thought, will transhumanism be a good thing?R
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I read you paper &quot;Extropian Ethics and the Extrosattva&quot; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; couple of months ago and thought it was very good. I didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initial response to Toth-Fejel was of the same high standard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An authorial comment years after the fact:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The two pieces were of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely different nature.  I took Toth-Fejel's article as a challenge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to some basic ideas I have developed after a lifetime of study and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, and wrote in my response with a much more rhetorically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggressive and responsive tone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The &quot;Extrosattva&quot; essay, on the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand, was an attempt to set out my ideas about ethics and morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affirmative, &quot;stand-alone&quot; way.
</em><br>
<p>Anders pointed me at this I can't remember all the detail, but the game
<br>
theory, PD stuff and the overall tenor I agreed with and thought it was
<br>
well written and nicely extropianised some of the better work on
<br>
&quot;practical ethics&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Partly so you know I've read the paper, but mainly because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is an unusual viewpoint and one I'm inclined to myself, I draw your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attention to a statement you made (its page 45 of 52 on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; printout. Within Dialog part 1):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You said (then):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &quot;(Unlike many transhumanists) I think an &quot;objective&quot; morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible, and thus that moral axioms are not &quot;unprovable&quot; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense that they are not derived from empirical observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and experiment&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Does Extropian Ethics and the Extrosattva represent your most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; developed thoughts or public thoughts on this subject?  I ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because I want to know where the frontiers lie in your view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and because I want to gauge whether new efforts in this area should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be a priority.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is my most developed public thoughts on the subject, because my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional work in the last few years has taken me away from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to write about ethics at the level I'd like to be able to.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. Too many important things. Too little time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly thought more about the questions presented there, and I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say I haven't changed my views substantially: I still find that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a foundation in game theory and evolutionary psychology for an objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.  Returning to the subject with the seriousness and commitment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it requires is one of my fondest desires, but I'm afraid I can't for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time being.
</em><br>
<p>Me either. Right now,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd be very interested in work done by anyone else in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction!
</em><br>
<p>Me too.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the reply Greg, I *am* on the same side as you (I think :-) ).
<br>
Unfortunately email is a slow form of communication and one doesn't
<br>
get the visual cues. And one needs to be aware of multiple readers so
<br>
posts get long.
