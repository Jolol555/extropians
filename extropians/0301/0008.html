<em>&gt; Barbara Blithered; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;I think if Clean flicks loose it'll be a pity, because with what they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing there's no short term or long term financial &quot;downside&quot; for anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in the long term there's considerable financial and artistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages for the artist(s).&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Snopes Sniped; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if CleanFlicks wins, consider the implications: They (or a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outfit) decides that, say, the appearance of O.J. Simpson in &quot;The Towering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inferno&quot; is objectionable, so they digitally &quot;edit&quot; the film and replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him with a different actor.  Is that still okay?
</em><br>
<p>Barbara Babbles;
<br>
Yes. Why not? (although I'd omit the word &quot;a different&quot; from the snope's
<br>
statement and replace it with &quot;an&quot; &lt;g&gt;). The Kung Fu spoof &quot;Kung Pow&quot;
<br>
showed just how greatly an original can be altered. We are not talking
<br>
about Clean flicks or similar forcing the rest of us to accept their
<br>
version over the original or about the destruction or cessation of
<br>
availability of the original version here: that would be an entirely
<br>
different kettle of Oscars. 
<br>
<p>Provided we're not talking about mass censorship, suppression of the
<br>
original, plagerisation (ie: &quot;passing off&quot;), avoidance of royalty
<br>
payments, false accreditation, or pirating; I can not see any harm in
<br>
creating versions edited to personal taste. Nor can I see any harm in
<br>
folk who share that taste sharing the edited version amongst themselves
<br>
providing the studio still gets their royalties. As these are folk who
<br>
would otherwise not view the movie or purchase the DVD/video it's a
<br>
source of income the studios/artists would not otherwise have.
<br>
<p>As with Kung Pow some &quot;edited&quot; versions may be elligable as works of
<br>
intellectual property in their own right, creating new films from the
<br>
old. The creators of the original material still get their credits and
<br>
royalties so there's no harm done is there?
<br>
<p>In the near future home computers will permit individuals to edit in
<br>
this manner anyway. Clean flicks are merely jumping into that narrow
<br>
time gap between the technology being restricted to the few who can
<br>
afford it and the advances that will make accessible to everyone. 
<br>
<p>Personally I look forward to that day: I'd cut the sex sequences from
<br>
many films (not out of prudishness, but at my age I find the squishy
<br>
bits just sooooo boring) and add Intermissions to long films like LoTR
<br>
(particularly the extended version!), or perhaps as a swordsperson
<br>
myself I'd make a compilation of cinematic and/or TV show sword fights
<br>
or Katas that I've liked. Why not? If I've paid for the original
<br>
version, so how I choose to view it, in whole or in part, is my affair
<br>
and no justified concern of the studios or artists.

<p><em>&gt; Rob Rote; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;But ultimately, I don't think people should tamper with any artistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation. If they can't stand the original, they can find some alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substitute with which to pass their time.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Snopes sniped; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as always, it's a matter of degree.  I doubt you'd object to someone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming his CD player to skip certain tracks on a disc, but isn't that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tampering with an artistic creation as well?  After all, if the artist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't intend and expect you to hear those particular songs (and in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific context), he wouldn't have released them in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>Barbara blithers;
<br>
Interesting you should bring this up. When cassette tape recording made
<br>
hone editing and home compilations possible it wasn't the artists who
<br>
objected but the studios. They called it &quot;home piracy&quot; and campaigned
<br>
for a performing rights surcharge on blank tapes.
<br>
<p>However, &quot;home piracy&quot; wasn't illegal if the editor was using commercial
<br>
LPs/Tapes which they had legitimately bought and were not passing on or
<br>
selling their edited versions. Eventually the studios realized that folk
<br>
who did this would often buy a whole LP simply so they could extract a
<br>
single track. Whereas if they didn't have that ability they'd either
<br>
regard purchase of the whole work a waste of money, or too much hassle
<br>
and effort to line up a single track. So &quot;home piracy&quot; actually provided
<br>
the studios and artists with a source of revenue they wouldn't otherwise
<br>
have. The studio's assumption that every &quot;copy&quot; was a lost sale was
<br>
proven fallacious, and the whole surcharge thing was quietly downplayed.
<br>
<p>The inability to do this with CDs was a major barrier to phasing out
<br>
cassettes. The studios and manufacturers recognized this and nowadays
<br>
one can go into a booth in Virgin, Tescos, or W H Smiths (and the like)
<br>
and select individual tracks from popular artists works and burn ones
<br>
own personal compilation album. Likewise the ability to edit and create
<br>
compilations is hyped as the major selling point of Sony's mini-disk
<br>
system (&quot;get creative&quot; they say), and rather more discretely included in
<br>
the sales pitch for home computers which have the ability to burn CDs.
<br>
<p>Personally I'll lament the demise of the cassette tape. The ICE cassette
<br>
systems require much less diver attention to change tapes than change
<br>
CDs, and even to programme, or make a selection, on an in-car multi CD
<br>
player take ones attention away from the road for far to long in my
<br>
opinion. Perhaps when such devices are voice activated they'll be safe.
<br>
<p>The music industry nowadays approves of home editing because of the
<br>
advantages to the music industry; the film industry will no doubt follow
<br>
suit after an initial period of resistance. Recall that the Film
<br>
industry was violently opposed to home VCRs, and even the video industry
<br>
as a whole, claiming that the video industry would inevitably cause the
<br>
death of the film industry, whereas the actual outcome was that video
<br>
sales and rentals proved to be the salvation of the film industry.
<br>
Likewise Clean flicks and their like will provide a source of revenue
<br>
the industry would not otherwise have had. 
<br>
<p>Imagine a Clean flicks version of Harry Potter with &quot;wizard/witch&quot;
<br>
changed to &quot;prophet&quot; with the good guys spells in Aramaic or calling
<br>
upon saints, and the bad guys like Voldemort becoming Satanists invoking
<br>
the Devil for their arts. The Christian Right, who've stayed away from
<br>
these films in droves, would approve of such editing, and the story's
<br>
core message of friendship, loyalty, and good over evil would not be
<br>
lost. No one except the Christian Right would watch such an edited
<br>
version, it wouldn't be thrust upon the rest of us, and the studios
<br>
would get royalties they wouldn't otherwise get. I don't see any
<br>
downside to this.
<br>
<p>For centuries music composers have been in the position that every
<br>
artist who performs their composition will place their own
<br>
interpretation upon it; some interpretations are so radical that the
<br>
composition has meanings never intended by the composer. The altering of
<br>
the Irish anti-war ballad &quot;Johnny I hardly Knew Ye&quot; to the pro-war &quot;When
<br>
Johnny Comes Marching Home Again&quot; springs to mind (I use to perform
<br>
both; doing the US Civil War version first segwayed into the slower
<br>
Irish version; which I felt gave the latter's anti-war stance a greater
<br>
impact).
<br>
<p>Composers seen their creativity as providing the raw materiel for the
<br>
creativity of others. The Music industry recognizes that stance and
<br>
exploits it now, where once they opposed it: I believe the Film industry
<br>
will go the same way after a similar initial resistance.
