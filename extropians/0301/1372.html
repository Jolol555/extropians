<p>
The following article from the economist on American public opinion
<br>
may be of interest. Poll data is from Jan 8-12th (before France,
<br>
Russia and China -UN Security Council permanent members made
<br>
recent statements opposing war without UN endorsement).
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/world/na/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=1548516">http://www.economist.com/world/na/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=1548516</a>
<br>
<p>I found it interesting that &quot;10% of Americans have opposed all military 
<br>
action (that was the share against war in Afghanistan)&quot; and &quot;one-third
<br>
support all wars (that was the share that backed the Vietnam war to 
<br>
the end)&quot;.
<br>
<p>The following quotes &quot; are from the article. Brackets [ ] are mine.
<br>
<p>-
<br>
<p>&quot;The upshot is that, over Iraq, public opinion [that's American public
<br>
opinion] puts few constraints on the president's freedom of action&quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&quot;..public opposition is unlikely to be a constraint unless the war's 
<br>
opponents can find national leadership. At the moment, support is 
<br>
partisan: 80% of Republicans back the use of force, compared with
<br>
46% of Democrats. But all except one of the Democrats' leading
<br>
presidential candidates supported the congressional resolution 
<br>
authorising force. What was seen in microcosm at the anti-war 
<br>
demonstration [&quot;50,000 on the lawn in front of the Capitol last
<br>
weekend&quot;] is true nationally. Mr Bush has opposition to war where
<br>
he wants it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;This gives [President Bush] a lot of options. If he goes to war, people
<br>
will support him (indeed, the first effect will be a huge rally around the
<br>
flag). If he gives inspectors more time, people will back that too. From
<br>
the point of view of voters, a second UN resolution looks desirable,
<br>
not essential. the only doubt is what happens in the unlikely event that 
<br>
Mr Bush decides not to go to war. In that case, his conservative base
<br>
will doubtless accuse him of flinching, like his dad. But for the public,
<br>
even that course may be tolerable, if the president can convince them
<br>
that his threats have disarmed Saddam. In short, in terms of the 
<br>
administration's freedom of action, reluctant acceptance of war
<br>
without appetite looks better than bloodthirsty enthusiasm.&quot;
