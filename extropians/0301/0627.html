<p>I certain said no such thing.  But it should give us pause that 
<br>
we support and use such persons and tactics when it suits our 
<br>
desires and then condemn as if they are utterly depraved and 
<br>
that we should obliterate them from the face of the earth in the 
<br>
next mood and set of purposes that hit us.  It might even stir 
<br>
us to a bit deeper reflection instead of continuously thrashing 
<br>
about, now befriending and condoning, now destroying and utterly 
<br>
despising.  But most people and indeed entire countries prefer 
<br>
simple little sub-slices of the truth at a time and then only 
<br>
those that are too their liking.
