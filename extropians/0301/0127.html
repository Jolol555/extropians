</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, let's debate this.
</em><br>
<p>I've read the piece Damien refers too as well. Lyle Burkhead
<br>
looks to me like the sort of guy you might need to be careful
<br>
where you were seen (or more likely overheard talking with)
<br>
but on the whole based only on his writting he comes across
<br>
to me as a likeable and intelligent guy wrestling as many 
<br>
intelligent folk do with ways to make progress and to improve
<br>
his own and the &quot;human condition&quot;. I can imagine he would
<br>
get into a lot of trouble, perhaps more than he needs to, and 
<br>
might express exactly the sort of views that are so easily 
<br>
distorted in sound bytes and caricatured by the media. But
<br>
I can also imagine his sort easily beneath the sort of broad
<br>
umbrella of transhumanism I'd approve of. And he to his
<br>
credit would not care if I approved.   
<br>
<p>In an earlier time Lyle is the seems to me to be the sort
<br>
who would have gotten himself (and perhaps others
<br>
around) him burnt as a witch. The witch-burners would
<br>
be wrong but Lyle and associates would be no less burnt
<br>
for that. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, how can a transhumanist be a racist if the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of transhumanist runs counter to the very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of a racist?
</em><br>
<p>Having just read Greg's response to Toth Fejel as well, it is 
<br>
becoming fairly clear to me that the term transhumanism has
<br>
meant and probably still means different things to different 
<br>
people.  
<br>
<p>Lyle himself makes clear that there is in his mind a distinction
<br>
between types of transhumanists and that he may be a 
<br>
transhumanist but not necessarily say an Extropian. 
<br>
<p>I can imagine a person questioning honestly the validity of 
<br>
racial claims and still being a transhumanist. Only Athena
<br>
emerges whole from the thigh of Zeus the rest of us have
<br>
to form and review our ideas and prejudices in real time
<br>
and over time.
<br>
<p>If I am the bell weather for racism then I think the fight 
<br>
against racism is doing very well. I'm not of course. I still
<br>
think its legitimate to consider differences between groups
<br>
and races. As it happens its not my area of interest but it
<br>
is not invalid per se, or so far as I can see anti-transhumanist
<br>
per se to question whether there are racial differences that
<br>
are significant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, are you stating that some *people who might call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves transhumanists through an association of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some specific set of beliefs and  goals of transhumanists*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are racists?
</em><br>
<p>On my reading, Lyle Burkhead, from his own words, falls 
<br>
exactly into this category. I would therefore say this
<br>
statement is true as he is an instance of the class &quot;some 
<br>
people&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a person, such as Lyle Burkhead (I don't know him,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the name is familiar),  or Mr. X, turns adverse to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and disconnects from a belief system that he once felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aligned to, and in his adversity begins to act in a manner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is ethically questionable, would you call him the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same person who he had been in a very different mind set?
</em><br>
<p>I would.
<br>
<p>Though that Lyle Burkhead has a *very* different minset 
<br>
now to that which he had earlier would not seem to be his 
<br>
view, or mine based on what he says (only) in the link
<br>
&nbsp;referenced. 
<br>
<p>Also I'm not sure I'd want to be connected to a belief system
<br>
either, I like Max More's approach to belief systems, as I 
<br>
understand it. Beliefs are too be avoided if possible and
<br>
minimised when not - hence PCR. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, would you claim that Mr. X had some sort of mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconnect and that  his behavior was more symptomatic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anger and [rage] and that because of  this behavioral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dysfunction was  emotionally out of touch with reality?
</em><br>
<p>Based only on the reading of the link. I would not think this
<br>
description fits Lyle Burkhead (or by extrapolation Mr X.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, would you claim that Mr. X was still the very same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  person he had been and that the identity and affiliations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he had once claimed were in a state of stasis? -- That he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was still a transhumanist (if he ever claimed to be, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know) and that his strain or brand of  beliefs, in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; racist tone, are transhumanist?
</em><br>
<p>He did claim to be at some stages. He wrestled with 
<br>
whether the label was worth the effort. A wrestling most
<br>
intelligent people go through in my view when deciding to
<br>
describe themselves with words or isms that carry baggage. 
<br>
<p>I'd say Mr X is the same person. Aspects of him have
<br>
changed but his personhood was not discontinuous merely
<br>
because his opinions changed and he varied from time to 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Brett
<br>
<p>PS:  Well before I was aware that there were such things
<br>
as transhumanists I was a sceptic (I founded a university
<br>
skeptical society) and was for several years a &quot;card 
<br>
carrying humanist.  I must have flagged the interest of the
<br>
US sceptics recently some how as they've sent me an
<br>
express post offer to subscribe and denote :-) 
<br>
<p>For several years I was a member of a state branch of
<br>
a humanist society. One of the things that put me off
<br>
&quot;organised&quot; humanism was the behaviour of others who
<br>
also called themselves humanists. Ironically what 
<br>
motivated the worst behaviours was a concern by some 
<br>
of the stalwarts of the society that all their time and effort
<br>
in building it would be wasted, that the society's name 
<br>
and reputation would be irreparable damaged if certain
<br>
irresponsible practices and people were allowed to do
<br>
and say as they pleased. (For the record I do NOT see
<br>
ExI in this light). It does not take much imagination to 
<br>
see that these stalwarts of the society were right to be
<br>
concerned but it similarly take little imagination in my
<br>
&nbsp;view anyway to see how trying too hard to protect a
<br>
&quot;brand&quot; can actually choke of the very vitality of the 
<br>
organisation itself. 
<br>
<p>I wish I knew some magic answer that would allow
<br>
&nbsp;people to both form societies and leverage the good
<br>
that they could do collectively without at the same time
<br>
creating brands or flags that can be abused or tarnished
<br>
by opportunistic types. 
<br>
<p>Alas the line between constructive criticism of what one
<br>
wishes to improve and empower and running the risk
<br>
of becoming part of its destruction is a very hard line to
<br>
walk. 
<br>
<p>In my previous experience with the state humanist 
<br>
society I reluctantly came to the view that the same 
<br>
stalwarts that assured themselves they were holding the
<br>
society together were in fact only holding together only
<br>
their own vehicle. They were in my opinion blocking a 
<br>
more vibrant and relevant form of humanism. I was 
<br>
disappointed by that as I thought if ever there was an 
<br>
&quot;ism&quot; inclusive enough and self-evidently relevant
<br>
enough to have appeal to all people humanism 
<br>
sounded like it might be it. 
<br>
<p>Reluctantly I had to walk away. I could not have
<br>
reformed that particular society (I was concerned with
<br>
and focussing on improvements to its processes of
<br>
reporting and accountability etc, not personally seeking
<br>
a platform, I don't have trouble finding platforms) 
<br>
without first breaking it well beyond what I could
<br>
reasonably have repaired short of making it my life's
<br>
work. I wasn't willing to do that. All organisations lose
<br>
their vitality when one person has too much influence, 
<br>
and I had no interest in becoming that one person myself.
<br>
<p>Sorry to go off on a tangent, its just that I can empathise
<br>
both with those who are concerned not to have harm 
<br>
come to a good &quot;brand&quot; like ExI that is  doing *very* 
<br>
good work, and yet I also worry that if criticism, even
<br>
&nbsp;constructive criticism is limited only to those minor 
<br>
matters that even a casual reader of the list would not
<br>
find challenging then the health and vibrancy may not 
<br>
be able to be achieved. It could be that there is a level
<br>
of constructive criticism of any groups core values and
<br>
&nbsp;principles that (whilst needing  to happen for its health)
<br>
should not happen on a public  list. 
<br>
<p>Yet even that conclusion is troubling, because not all 
<br>
newbies to extropian thought will be intellectual lightweights
<br>
and if the material content gets too low or sanitised these
<br>
folk may actually be discouraged rather than encouraged.
<br>
But there is also another point. Extropians and transhumanists
<br>
are involved in a meme-war with, for want of a better word 
<br>
the forces of entropy. (FOE :-) ) We don't have to 
<br>
characterise these forces as persons, we can see them as
<br>
the behaviours and actions of persons, but the fact remains
<br>
there are strong forces in the community acting against the
<br>
memes and objects of extropians and we need robust forums
<br>
to counter those forces and marshal pro-active extropic
<br>
&nbsp;responses of our own. If this list goes too far down the path
<br>
of being a place for casually interested potential extropes 
<br>
to sample the fare without being put off, it may become less
<br>
of a forum of interest to those extropians willing and able to
<br>
&nbsp;marshal &quot;political&quot; action however gently that word is
<br>
&nbsp;interpreted. 
<br>
<p>My verbosity not withstanding I am not interested 
<br>
in hijacking anybody's forum or organisation. I think
<br>
the causes I would like to see more effective action
<br>
on are causes that are completely consistent with
<br>
mainstream extropic thought. I would include for 
<br>
instance the sharing and propagation of memes
<br>
and techniques that could accelerate, responsibly
<br>
and ethically the rate at which beneficial biotechnological
<br>
innovations and treatments may become available
<br>
to people. 
<br>
