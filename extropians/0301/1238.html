<p><em>&gt; One thing that has always really got on my tits!  (Annoyed me, for all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of you that are not British) Is the fact that IQ tests are timed. As a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufferer of dyslexicia &lt;G&gt;  I have always felt very hard done by when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completing said tests.  It takes me an age to read  the questions and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another age to reread them just to make sure I got it right the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I once knew your opposite number.  He was terrifically
<br>
good at any test, once scoring 105 on a government test (he
<br>
was trying to get a post office job), where the top score
<br>
possible was 100.  (He got an additional five points for
<br>
having been in the army.)
<br>
<p>But his opinion on any subject that was not some sort of
<br>
game or puzzle was entirely worthless.  So I divined from
<br>
his example that there had to be people exactly opposite;
<br>
namely, those who are slow as molasses on I.Q. tests, but
<br>
are profound enough that you practically want to hang on
<br>
their every word.  And indeed, such is the case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about giving me a chance to comprehend what I'm actually seeing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before you tell me the time is up. Surely the measure of intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be calculated by whether or not you can answer the question 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly.  Rather than simply how fast you can finish it. 
</em><br>
<p>For very large groups of people, the standardized tests---
<br>
with their time limits---work very well.  However, there
<br>
should be tests where &quot;whether you get it at all&quot; is what
<br>
counts.  For sure, there are many problems where all the
<br>
time in the world wouldn't be enough for many people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know this may cause some of you to say that speed does indicate the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of intelligence.  I'd say I do agree. Only the speed of the mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculation of the answer, not the speed of reading the question. 
</em><br>
<p>Even there, some people just think slower than others
<br>
but can still get to a deep result.  But yes, again,
<br>
the stats show that this is rare.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Thank God for spell check!&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>Are you kidding?  Several years ago I was a good speller.
<br>
<p>Lee
