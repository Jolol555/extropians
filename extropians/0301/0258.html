I can answer some of these questions (having been married to a Muslim).
<br>
Ramadan does indeed move through the solar year, by about 9 days per year so
<br>
while it's in winter at the moment prettry soon it's going to be in summer,
<br>
not nice given that you can't drink on top of not being able to eat. The way
<br>
being far north or south is handled is by ruling that if you are north or
<br>
south of an arbitrary line you follow the time that applies in most of the
<br>
Muslim world. That is pretty tough if you don't live far north enough to
<br>
qualify but are nearly there e.g. in much of Scotland. I think the problem
<br>
on Mars would be solved by following Mecca time but how you would work out
<br>
the direction of prayer I can't imagine.

Subject: ramadan
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I was viewing a program about Islam.  They mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that true Muslims fast while the sun is up during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the month of Ramadan.  Then they said the month is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a specific time of year, but is based on a lunar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; month.  I reason that the month of fasting must work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its way around the calendar, so that sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ramadan is in the winter and a few years later in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the summer.  Right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that is the case, what happens if Ramadan straddles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the summer solstice and the believer lives north
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the arctic circle?  Do they just starve?  Anders,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do they have this problem up your way?  If Ramadan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is around the winter solstice, those in the far north
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would scarcely notice.  Seems like the true believer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who didn't like fasting could just move to Damien's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood in those years which Ramadan was in July,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Sweden when it was in the December.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would a true believer in LEO work it?  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat quickly while in the earth's shadow?  What if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were in a polar orbit?  On Mars?  spike
