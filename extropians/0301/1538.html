</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Writers to the thread &quot;Why does the USA still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops in rich Europe&quot; came up with quite a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons---perhaps you missed that discussion.  See
</em><br>
<p>I miss a lot here because of the sheer amount of stuff and participation
<br>
in a few other lists as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't think one has to divine motives or just one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; motive to US troops being in Europe.  I think mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they're there now, when the original reason for them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; being there (the Soviet threat) is long gone just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because of institutional inertia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I nominate &quot;institutional inertia&quot; as reason number 9
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on our list.
</em><br>
<p>I second the nomination.:)
<br>
<p>In general, I wonder how much institutional inertia effects what we see
<br>
in the social and political arena.  These effects can take the form of
<br>
simple intertia -- &quot;we've always done things that way&quot; -- or more
<br>
sophisticated redefinitions -- NATO used to be about defending Western
<br>
Europe from a Soviet invasion, now it's about whatever the leaders of
<br>
NATO want; the IMF similarly was supposed to operate to uphold a certain
<br>
international monetary order, now it's a tool of trade policy and
<br>
shoring up investors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And this can replace our old &quot;reason number 2&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which had been &quot;Europeans save money on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense that way&quot;, which properly belongs on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list of why the Europeans don't kick the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans out.
</em><br>
<p>I would qualify that with &quot;some&quot; for the European side.  Obviously, some
<br>
Europeans do want American forces out of Europe.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers!
<br>
<p>Dan
