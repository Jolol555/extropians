<p>How so? Never come into being is much better than living a life of

constant misery.

<p>Well, some of those with defects are so extraordinaly grateful that 
<br>
they're stupid and silly enough to die of such defects, or commit suicide 
<br>
because they can't stand the pain.

<p><em>&gt; and not just out for a fast buck, who file such law

<p>Huh? They wouldn't be there to start with. That's the whole point: if life 
<br>
is hell it's better it never started. Being dumb about it is somewhat more 
<br>
excusable than actual malice aforethought but it still leaves us with one 
<br>
not exactly happy camper on our hands.
