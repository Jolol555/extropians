<em>&gt; &gt; But now, I ask you Eliezer, on list, for clarification.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As a *general rule*, can't we expect to have *both* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefits of *any* poster's insights and the courtesy and efficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of their placing their thoughts in the thread to which they relate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've sometimes joined together my replies where threads have split but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then converged, so I don't think this is particularly awful netiquette.
</em><br>
<p>If a thread diverges, then converges, I think that it *could* be fair
<br>
enough too. It depends a bit I think. I would hope that I would at least
<br>
think about whether I was injuring the context or clarity of the converging
<br>
threads which after all others have invested something in too.
<br>
<p>I'd hope others would think about this too as part of their weighting up
<br>
of whether converging a diverged thread was worth it.  Then when a
<br>
judgement in each particular case is made it may be a better one for
<br>
the extra consideration. In some cases *additional* context might be
<br>
found.
<br>
<p>I do *not* think any recent decision to combine unrelated threads was
<br>
*intentional* rude. But unintended rudeness not pointed out does not
<br>
give the person a chance to know what's happened or reduce the
<br>
chances of reoccurrence.
<br>
<p>I hope if anyone thinks I am rude that they will point it out to me for
<br>
my potential benefit as well.   I will try not to be.
<br>
<p>I do think it is worth our while given the constraints of a list to over-
<br>
engineer for courtesy with each other rather than to under-engineer
<br>
for it.   What's the downside to a bit of extra courtesy?R. The upside
<br>
seems obvious enough.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your clarifying comment.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
