</em><br>
<p>This is a UN embargo. A Freudian? (World==America==USA ?) Actually I
<br>
thought that America is the big continent composed of South and North
<br>
America.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Rudiger, the Europeans have played the game of trading with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all sides 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the First World War, Second World War, and you are doing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>Ron, that's personal. And wrong, too. For instance Germany didn't play
<br>
that game of trading with all sides: We were one side. The UK didn't
<br>
play that game either: They were firmly on the other side. Most of the
<br>
continent was occupied by Germany during most of the WWII.
<br>
<p>But that's history. Meaningless for todays politics. We're not arguing
<br>
about Saddam being a villain. We're arguing whether it's smart to poke
<br>
a stick into a bee's nest - that's what the middle east is. The risks
<br>
of getting stung are pretty high and anything but an immediate victory
<br>
can bring awkward results. History is full of battles that went wrong.
<br>
<p>This isn't cowardice. Applying force can be OK, but only if the threat
<br>
is substantial enough. In fact this is one of the major worries of
<br>
other countries: That the US' threshold for starting a war is getting
<br>
lower and lower. Most of the friends of the US don't want a new Roman
<br>
Empire and I hope the Americans don't want that either. We're anytime
<br>
at the side of an American partner as the example of Afghanistan shows.
<br>
An American bully is not welcome, though. 
<br>
<p>-Rudiger
