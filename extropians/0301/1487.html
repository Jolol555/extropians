<p>
I'm going to try and put my words into extropic &quot;action&quot;.
<br>
<p>The GM cows article from New Scientist contained a quote
<br>
from &quot;Vanessa Atkinson&quot; of &quot;Greenpeace Australia&quot;, to the
<br>
effect of:
<br>
<p>&quot;The rejection of genetically engineered food is very strong, in countries
<br>
like China as well as the West. And if people don't want to eat it, no
<br>
one will produce it - we've seen that clearly in Europe,&quot; says Vanessa
<br>
Atkinson of Greenpeace Australia. It would be important to ensure that
<br>
any GM animal ingredient would be labelled, she says.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, I would tend to disagree with the assertion that there is strong
<br>
resistance to GM foods in China (we are talking about the place where
<br>
there is extensive government and VC funding of stem cell research
<br>
as documented in my previous comments abstracted from publications
<br>
in Nature).  Bottom line -- people who are poor or starving will be
<br>
happy to consume whatever satisfies their hunger pangs and keeps them
<br>
alive.  If GM foods contain more protein, are less expensive, etc.
<br>
then can anyone *really* believe that people (other than those who
<br>
have been &quot;brainwashed&quot; in a religious cult perspective) would reject
<br>
consuming them?  The assertion is &quot;irrational&quot;.
<br>
<p>[The suggestions by Vanessa do raise the question of whether much
<br>
of Europe has indeed been &quot;brainwashsed&quot;.]
<br>
<p>*So*, in the vein of &quot;talk less&quot; -- &quot;do more&quot; (and I'm well aware
<br>
that &quot;doing&quot; may involve &quot;talking&quot; -- I offer up this URL:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/truefood/newsdetail.asp?PRID=345">http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/truefood/newsdetail.asp?PRID=345</a>
<br>
<p>Which seems to contain some telephone numbers for Vanessa and
<br>
her associates.
<br>
<p>Some interesting questions that pop into my mind....
<br>
<p>- &quot;Are you aware of how many people die from starvation each year?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is staggering -- 13-18 million people each year [1]
<br>
<p>- &quot;Have you done an analysis of how many people will starve to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death due to more expensive food costs as a result of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies Greenpeace is promoting?&quot;
<br>
<p>- &quot;Do you have any problems going to sleep at night knowing that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your activities may result in the deaths of millions of human lives?&quot;
<br>
<p>(The last one is a bit of a stretch since it assumes the &quot;green&quot;
<br>
perspective will prevail.)
<br>
<p>But I'm sure you get the basic idea.  Invent your own questions.
<br>
Get creative.  Then call Vanessa's office or Vanessa herself.
<br>
<p>Be polite.  Be &quot;reasonable&quot;.  But do not be reluctant to
<br>
&quot;raise the issues&quot;.  After all people will live or die based
<br>
on how *really* extropic we are willing to be.
