<p>
Mike Butler asks some great questions.  I am
<br>
considerably relieved that at least one person
<br>
has some idea of what I am talking about:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin wrote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If &quot;&gt;&quot; is a preference relation, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; normal &gt; abnormal &gt; null.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For some preference relationship(s). Yours?
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  (although &quot;relation&quot; is the correct term mathematically)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What of the people who [say they] wish they had never been born?
</em><br>
<p>As for me, they are either correct or incorrect about
<br>
their lives having been worth living to them.  If this
<br>
is a persistent attitude---and it's not just that they've
<br>
been recently jilted by a lover---then their lives are
<br>
not worth living, and it would have been much better if
<br>
someone similar to them but not quite identical had been
<br>
rescued from non-existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ? contented &gt; suffering &gt; null ?
</em><br>
<p>No.  If the suffering is enough to make a life
<br>
not worth living, then
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contented &gt; null &gt; suffering
<br>
<p>(BTW for others, a preference relation should not be
<br>
read as meaning exactly &quot;greater than&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ? resigned &gt; struggling &gt; never-born ?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I'm not parsing that one very well.  Often
<br>
people who seem &quot;resigned&quot; to their fates, are sometimes
<br>
called &quot;fatalistic&quot; I suppose, sometimes just &quot;depressed&quot;.
<br>
They may or may not have lives worth living (to them).
<br>
The same for those who struggle with life, as often
<br>
we all do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Says who?  On what basis?  On a bad day, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things won't get better.  What if bad days are as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good as it gets?
</em><br>
<p>Says me.  (But in a way that I hope persuades others.)
<br>
<p>If the bad days are so numerous that you consistently
<br>
wish you never had been born, then it would have been
<br>
better if someone else had been born, or even null.
<br>
Yet we are not too far away from a time in which our
<br>
psychological ailments can be treated---after all,
<br>
people should have internalized by now a materialist
<br>
perspective, and understand that the satisfaction, joy,
<br>
contentment, happiness, and other states merely reflect
<br>
the chemical constitution of one's brain at time t.
<br>
<p>I have one desperate friend thinking of suicide, because
<br>
the total value of his life is sinking into the red, and
<br>
there is only a little hope left that he'll get better.
<br>
But he is intelligent enough to recognize the possibility
<br>
---there is almost always hope---, and besides he is also
<br>
enough up to speed to be wanting to punt, and get frozen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problems of informed versus retroactive consent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are many.  So are the problems of an entity's chattel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus sovereign status--even sans the hard-edged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duality implied by that way of putting it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; One philology source I've read claims the ancient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greeks and Romans didn't even have a word for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving newborns out on flat rocks if they didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem fit.  Supposedly, the term &quot;infanticide&quot; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coined by a much later Christian scholar. Go figure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no recipe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a solution, but the margins of this email are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too small to contain the proof.
</em><br>
<p>;-) Yes. But I'm appreciative that you've probably
<br>
got something *new* in mind that isn't just a desperate
<br>
form of curve-fitting to ancient traditions that passes
<br>
for most of the debate on this subject.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
