<p>
<em>&gt; One possible way to improve the effectiveness of information sharing on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list might be to create a web-based structure of shared knowledge to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complement the discussion on this list.  It may be time now for an extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiki site.
</em><br>
<p>I'm rather fond of the things myself, particular Wikipedia, for which
<br>
I wrote the software.  If there are enough folks who think such a site
<br>
would be useful, I'd be happy to set it up or even host it.
