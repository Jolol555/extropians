</em><br>
<p>Artillo, I would have to go and do some serious investigative work
<br>
(multi-hours if not days) to find some concrete references to
<br>
answer these questions in detail.  But I can answer them &quot;approximately&quot;
<br>
from my knowledge and personal reveiw of some of the relevant
<br>
literature.
<br>
<p>The U.S. has an active program for the disassembly of nuclear weapons
<br>
dictated by the various Start/&quot;arms reduction&quot; treaties.
<br>
<p>This seems to be a useful URL:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cps-nuke.htm">http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cps-nuke.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I believe much of the nuclear weapons disassembly is taking place
<br>
at the Pantex plant in Amarillo, Texas.  Now precisely what is done
<br>
with the Uranium/Plutonium after disassembly I don't know.  I would
<br>
presume it is classified information.
<br>
<p>But it is a given that both the U.S. and Russia have thousands
<br>
of nuclear weapons.  It seems likely that other nuclear powers,
<br>
e.g. the U.K. and France probably have hundreds of nuclear weapons.
<br>
India and Pakistan probably have dozens.
<br>
<p>The U.S. did develop chemical and biological weapons in the '60s
<br>
and '70s.  However, the U.S. military seems to have disliked them
<br>
due to their lack of specificity.  That is probably a primary reason
<br>
why the U.S. signed onto the &quot;Biological Weapons Treaty&quot; and began
<br>
to destroy these weapons many years ago.  I believe that process
<br>
is largely complete (though to be certain you should research it).
<br>
Biological entities that could cause significant harm would be
<br>
classified such that they could only be dealt with in P4 class
<br>
facilities in the U.S.  There are only few (perhaps a dozen?)
<br>
such labs in the U.S. and they are not designed to manufacture
<br>
large quantities of these agents.  [Bottom line: I believe the
<br>
U.S. has largely destroyed any of its biological weapons -- or
<br>
has a concrete plan for doing so.  Chemical weapons may be a
<br>
bit more problematic, but I believe they have been/are on the
<br>
same path.]
<br>
<p>However, Russia did develop some quite sophisticated biological
<br>
weapons during the cold war.  To the best of my knowledge there
<br>
are *tons* of those weapons that are still in storage.  Russia
<br>
is supposed to be disposing of them but as with many things in
<br>
Russia they are still in negotiations as to who will pay for them
<br>
to do this.
