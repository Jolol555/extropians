<em>&gt; Hmm, how does your constitution help you here? Mind you,

<em>&gt; I think your consitution is a wonderful document and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American constitutionalism a positive thing. But it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; not internal bloat. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the courts were able to handle the bloat problem until the
<br>
FDR dynasty threatened them with irrelevancy by packing the court.
<br>
Until the packing episode, the courts had struck down every one of his
<br>
proposals as unconstitutional bloat. Since that time, there have been
<br>
few attempts to redress the problem, since demogogues have redefined
<br>
the terms 'interstate commerce' and 'public welfare' to encompass any
<br>
socialist flight of fantasy. The bloat is now entrenched with
<br>
significant constituencies beyond merely the bureaucratic class.
<br>
<p>Nor was FDR the first to do this. His cousin, Teddy, and his
<br>
'Progressive' party, along with the muckrakers and socialists like
<br>
Sinclair Lewis's propaganda and disinformation, created the first bloat
<br>
primarily as a response to a tendency of the industrial revolution to
<br>
distort the socio-economic landscape into a more euro-esque vertical
<br>
patron/client orientation rather than the horizontal citizen-citizen
<br>
relationships typical of the pre-Lincoln era (excepting the slavery
<br>
problem).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If government bureaucracies as currently structured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tend to grow overlarge, cannot we look at that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structure, find the factors at fault, and propose a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; restructuring aimed at improving the situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure. I think the libertarian approach has much to offer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here. We need some buraucracy for some things, but it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risky and has to be kept under control. Public choice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory shows some of the economics of this. One way to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep it in check is to reduce the incentives of growth, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to set up funding and organisation so that it is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable for any office to grow beyond just what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed - ideally it should shrink if it could. Generally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setting up strong economic constraints on government 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be very helpful. 
</em><br>
<p>I think that a primary means of accomplishing it is through
<br>
competition. Multiple departments of education, welfare, etc where
<br>
citizens can subscribe to one or the other and the bureaucrats must
<br>
compete for clients, and cannot compel participation.
