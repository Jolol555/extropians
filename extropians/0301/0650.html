<p><em>&gt;&gt; I'd like to suggest my self-published book _Create/Recreate: The 
</em><br>
3rd
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Millennial Culture_ because it is the only book available to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;date that explains the history of transhumanism. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Natasha, I'm interested to hear more about your experience with
</em><br>
self-publishing.  As I've posted to the list, I'm working on my own
<br>
book, _More Than Human_, which is an overview of several 
<br>
transhumanist technologies and an argument that fundamentally we 
<br>
ought to pursue these technologies as a way to improve ourselves and 
<br>
our world.&lt;
<br>
<p>What I like about self-publishing is that it allows the author to design 
<br>
the book without worrying about costs/expenses and publisher 
<br>
interference, and that the book can be revised/updated at any time 
<br>
without having to go through a lengthy negotiations meeting.
<br>
<p>Also advantageous to self-publishing is the fact that if a person is 
<br>
smart about marketing, anything is possible.  Most self-published 
<br>
books, here in the US, are considered acceptable and some people 
<br>
even consider self-publishing to be a sign of a self-starter, a person 
<br>
who enjoys being on first base and 3rd base simultaneously, and 
<br>
someone who is not afraid of the publishing industry (which can be 
<br>
pretty unnerving).
<br>
<p>However, self-publishing, for all its bandied accolades, high praises, 
<br>
you-go attitude, still - still self-publishing is looked down upon by many 
<br>
people who think that it means that a person cannot get an agent or a 
<br>
publisher.
<br>
<p>This is the misnomer.  To the contrary, people who self-publish tend to 
<br>
be impatient.  They also tend to be people who enjoy being creative 
<br>
and also producing.  Some just have something to say and don't want 
<br>
to wait for someone to tell them that it is okay to say it.
<br>
<p>If a self-publisher becomes a best seller or the author gets on Opra 
<br>
Winfrey then no one thinks it is a cop-out.  Otherwise, there is always a 
<br>
lifted eyebrow and people who not consider a self-publisher to be a 
<br>
real author.
<br>
<p>In my case, I already had a Hollywood top agent wanting to sign me as 
<br>
a writer (Paul Kohner Agency - can't get any better than that when I 
<br>
started writing).  When I chose futurism as my topic of interest, no one 
<br>
wanted to sign me because it was too early on (1980s).
<br>
<p>Today, I don't worry about getting a publisher if the topic is good, if the 
<br>
writing is good, and there are potential sales.
<br>
<p>That is the name of the game.  Supply and demand.  If they can sell it - 
<br>
you have a deal.
<br>
<p>For the ABCs of self-publishing, just write it, put it in PageMaker or 
<br>
Quark or another program and take it to a printer.  Put up a website to 
<br>
market it and take it to conferences.  When you have your book 
<br>
completed, I'll give you some marketing tips.
<br>
<p>Would I do it again?  YES!  It may be in video formatt or CD, but I'm a 
<br>
producer so it comes naturally :-)
