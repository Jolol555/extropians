<em>&gt;&gt; The interesting thing (at least to me) is that if something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; built this way breaks, there is no way in hell you are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to be able to fix it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Interesting, it means you could run the printer all night
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; printing out palm-pilots and then go out the next day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and use them for skeet practice.
</em><br>
<p>Not unless you're wealthy enough to be a sporting clays enthusiast
<br>
(for those unfamiliar: &quot;sporting clays&quot; has been described as &quot;golf with
<br>
shotguns&quot; and it's a pricy hobby for, e.g., well-to-do plastic surgeons).
<br>
<p>A little homiletic anecdote:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ink cassettes for an ALPS 2010 cost $9 retail; the full complement
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;costs me $36 (incrementally, of course).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don't I buy reloading supplies? Because the cartridges are dye-sub tape,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not inkjet liquid. I didn't want my printouts to run in the rain, and I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gambled that there'd be second sources for the ink. I lost that bet.
<br>
<p>So... let's see what the cost-per-cc for these items turns out to be... :\
<br>
<p>Now, over in Shenzhen, where they can run city-block-sized floors of
<br>
such machines, fed by big rooftop vats of noxious monomer brew--that might
<br>
show some economy of scale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is an old idea that I have been following for a while.
</em><br>
<p>Me too (at least 10 years).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       Its about time rapid prototyping machines and polytronic printing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were merged. I wonder how long it will be before you can print a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lambourghini Diablo? &lt;G&gt; Does anyone know of a suitably strong, heat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof polymer that could be printed into an engine?
</em><br>
<p>The best temp performance polymers I know of are high-temp liquid crystals
<br>
used to mold, e.g., the connector housings for thermocouples. They spec out
<br>
at something well under 500F.
<br>
<p>You're up against a pretty fundamental limit of materials, I suspect: any
<br>
hydrocarbon polymer is going to poop out somewhere around the flash point of paper.
<br>
<p>Conceivable that, after forming, you could heat-drive the hydrogen off
<br>
(as they do today with some Santa Claus casing forming tech) to get carbon
<br>
matrix x y and z, but those are not very strong compared to bulk solid materials.
<br>
<p>Now, if you consider _diamond_ a polymer... :)
<br>
<p>Sintering metals or ceramics seems superficially plausible, but I'd guess
<br>
it loses a lot in strength without very special manufacturing tech.
<br>
<p>For me, that leaves hypotech such as [s]elf-assembling ([Sic], given the monicker
<br>
&quot;Santa Claus Machine&quot;, plus the hypothetical nature) nano&quot;crystals&quot; in a slurry.
