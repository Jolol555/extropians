In my opinion, Americans have the right to defend themselves against Iraq whenever their nation is invaded by Iraqi forces.

<p>Damien, thank you for the much needed support.  I'm actually much more concerned about Canada and Mexico launching a massive two-pronged sneak attack against the United States while all our troops are away in the middle east!  Fidel Castro of course will be the mastermind behind the entire operation...  ; )
<br>
<p>Seriously, it is the indirect attack done through third parties in the form of terrorism which worries us about Iraq.  We created this Frankenstein monster and now we must go kill it.  
<br>
<p>It's just very sad that several thousand U.S. troops may die in house to house fighting in Baghdad, but that's what they signed up for.  I'm certain an oil company CEO would say that to his confidantes as they watch on the news the bodybags come home.  
<br>
<p>I think there MAY be very positive effects to the U.S. led toppling of Saddam's regime.  When our forces have vanquished his large middle eastern nation and are occupying it, the entire region will once and for all see our now unrivaled power to crush our foes is to be dearly respected.  Of course heavyhitters like Russia and China (even North Korea or &quot;ally&quot; Pakistan) are still off the list since we would be biting off more then we could chew. lol   
<br>
<p>Next on our list of nations needing behavior modification should be Saudi Arabia.  I would never want a &quot;friend&quot; who behaves like them!  I just wish our oil addicted/ corrupt corporate and gov't leaders would have the resolve to go fullbore into a program to relieve us of foreign oil dependancy.        
<br>
<p>I agree with Mez that the real potential problem is China.  They have all the raw materials to over the next several decades grow into a serious regional if not global bully.  I just hope they prove better than that.      
<br>

<br>
My father lives in New York City and I pray the consequences of our occupation of Iraq is not seeing him and millions of others being vaporized by a terrorist nuke.
<br>
<p>Pax Americana!
<br>
<p>hoping for the best,
<br>
<p>John
