<p><em>&gt;... I ask you, what moral claim does a country have

to

<br>
make ANY moral claim to 
<br>
existence? Does it have a 'right' to exist? Since it
<br>
does not respect 
<br>
rights of individuals, it clearly can make no claims
<br>
to rights. It is a 
<br>
nation built on oppression, threats, pain, and
<br>
murder.&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;And???? Like is there another kind of nation state?&quot;
<br>
<p>This is a difficult question to answer.  Is there ANY form of state that is
<br>
moral?  Obviously most libertarians or anarchocapatialists would answer
<br>
'no!'  I am still attempting to create an informed opinion on this, but
<br>
tentatively I would say that a government that exists only to protect
<br>
individual civil liberties, protect against foreign threats, and ensures
<br>
property rights while not regulating the economy, science, or any moral
<br>
actions beyond those which threaten or assault person or property could be
<br>
consider, by me at least, moral.  It would need be a constitutional republic
<br>
as well, with severe limitations on what the majority can vote into law.  
<br>
<p>Given that though, I certainly do believe that some states can be LESS
<br>
IMMORAL than other states.  A democratic constitional republic with some
<br>
socialist policies (like the US) is definitely less immoral than any garden
<br>
variety corrupt despotic theocratic regime.  To not acknowledge that some
<br>
variations of statehood are better than others, while still not being
<br>
*perfect* robs the people of the chance to create better states.
<br>
<p>Such was the case in Vietnam, North Vietnam was clearly a corrupt despotic
<br>
state, it subjugated oppressed and killed its people and was bent on doing
<br>
the same to South Vietnam, with the industrial support of the Soviet Union,
<br>
a similiarly morally invalid state, and South Vietnam was a democratic state
<br>
that did not want to live under such a rule.  While South Vietnam was not
<br>
perfect, it was orders of magnitude less imperfect than the north, and
<br>
regardless of who signed what, no document can make what north vietnam did
<br>
moral.
