<p>So, the prime goal has not been achieved.

</em><br>
<p>IMHO, an elegant way would be to improve the self-marketing of the 
<br>
western principles, which would dry out the basis for hatred and false 
<br>
beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Terrorist attacks against Osama sympathizers would have shocked the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>... which would give the extremists propaganda more influence. You can 
<br>
not demand respect for democracy and human rights by breaking your own 
<br>
principles. That's like fucking for virginity. If you go into foreign 
<br>
countries and kill well-known people there, you give their followers 
<br>
every right(*) to come into your country and kill your people. Once you 
<br>
drop onto this level, all moral principles become invalid and it will be 
<br>
extremely difficult to earn back any respect for them.
<br>
<p>(*) not by real law, but by their sense of justice, that's for sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should I break out the hankerchiefs? 
</em><br>
<p>No, but neither has the prime goal be achieved, nor is the country now 
<br>
less dangerous with respect to givinbg shelter to terrorists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They and their stupid blue helmets can go to hell. 
</em><br>
<p>These stupid blue helmets (they're green these days) help to finish what 
<br>
the US have begun. They protect the new adminitration against the war 
<br>
lords, educate the local police how a civil and lawful society works, 
<br>
etc. Without the UN troops, Afghanistan would immediately fall back into 
<br>
old habits. Bottom line: The allied forces didn't finish the job, 
<br>
because it isn't just a military thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Afghanistan is freer now and the murderous regime, which you seem to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gloss over is kaput.
</em><br>
<p>Please stop your imputations that I would sympathize with dictators or 
<br>
terrorists. I don't. And I don't support aggression, neither from 
<br>
terrorist, nor from allies. It's fine that the Taliban regime is 
<br>
destroyed, but the problem will not be solved until a stable, free and 
<br>
democratic society has been established with the support and 
<br>
understanding of the people there. And frankly, hadn't bin Ladin 
<br>
accidently been in Afghanistan, the US government would have given a 
<br>
shit about how cruel and gruesome the Taliban are. They have even made 
<br>
deals with them for many years when this seemed to suit US interests.
<br>
<p>It's not enough to destroy the oppressor; you have to support the 
<br>
development process afterwards and the positive forces of that country. 
<br>
The only one positive example in history I can remember, where an 
<br>
oppressive regime has been destroyed, a nation been freed and then be 
<br>
helped to develop a stable, democratic society is Germany - because it 
<br>
was needed in the upcoming cold war. That's why Marshall won over 
<br>
Morgenthau.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as hidden bad guys, in Japan, Italy, and Germany, we had a few of those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; folks also, after WW2, securing office. Kurt Waldheim as Chancellor of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Austria, and yes UN chieftan, comes to mind.
</em><br>
<p>Uh-oh, we should be very careful with accusations in this area. The 
<br>
whole US space program of the 50s to the 70s has been lead by former 
<br>
Nazi followers. Von Braun even was a member of the SS and has surely 
<br>
known where the forced labor in Peenemünde came from. The former german 
<br>
rocket team got clearance from the US military, approved by the 
<br>
government, which was clearly against the US law at that time. And if we 
<br>
really go back into that time, we shouldn't forget the grandfather of 
<br>
G.W.Bush, who was convicted 1942 for being a collaborator with the 
<br>
Nazis. I don't think it makes any sense to dig out rotten corpses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This hypothesis has been bounced around, and what actually results 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experientially is the Islamic street, the Souk, respects power and its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steady use.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; I think you try too hard to please people who may just dislike you no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter what you attempt.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. My concern is the question what will come after the bombing and 
<br>
the high chance of long and murderous house to house fights against 
<br>
brainwashed Iraqi soldiers.
<br>
<p>Steady use of power would mean to maintain military presence in that 
<br>
region and thus feed the picture of the evil occupant. The main effect 
<br>
will be to quicken the extremists groups. That's what I mean by bombing 
<br>
is not enough as long as you don't win the support of the people.
<br>
<p>There are situations, where a military strike is necessary to push the 
<br>
development into the right direction. But without good aftercare, every 
<br>
surgery will end in a desaster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The success of the Islamist today are a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflection of the failure of Arab nationalism, Baathist Socialism, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so forth. They are pissed off at the west because they are envious, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they seem to feel that if they have all the answers, due to being the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'true faith,' then why does the West prosper?
</em><br>
<p>Does it really? Only if you look for material values, i.e. follow the 
<br>
belief system of the West. Those who didn't have the luck of being born 
<br>
in a rich country do see our wealthiness, especially the overly open 
<br>
demonstartion of wealthiness in the US. But they also see that they'll 
<br>
never have chance to participate in this luxury. It's a common strategy 
<br>
of the human mind to emphasize the drawbacks of things one cannot have 
<br>
and turn to things one can have instead. Combined with the impression, 
<br>
that the rich -we- live at the expense of the poor -them- and only 
<br>
support our kind -e.g. Israel-, it's easy to understand why muslim 
<br>
movements are such much en vogue these days.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, this vicious circle will endlessly feed the extremist 
<br>
groups. The more aggressive the West acts, the more aggressive and 
<br>
dangerous this enemy will become. To break the circle, we either have to 
<br>
kill every possible follower, which are many millions of people or find 
<br>
better ways than military strikes.
