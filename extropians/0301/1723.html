In fairness to the New York Times, finally, after going down
<br>
two levels, and to a page containing 41 &quot;headline&quot; items, one
<br>
does find the 23rd one almost reluctantly saying
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who Stands With U.S.? Europe Is of Two Minds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By JOHN TAGLIABUE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARIS, Jan. 30 — As Europe struggles to define its position
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward Iraq, the debate is generating not an Iraq problem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a Europe problem, a growing split between nations like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France and Germany that are defending a narrower, European
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interest and those looking to a broader, North Atlantic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alliance.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[It still would just kill the NYT, evidently, to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have the either the topic sentences or the headline
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to refer to the strong support itself.]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gravity of the problem became evident today after
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the leaders of eight European countries published an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open letter in The Wall Street Journal and several
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European papers extolling the &quot;bravery and generosity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of America&quot; and calling on the international community
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to take a united stand against Iraq...
<br>
<p>But it's possible that *if* the letter had been sent to the
<br>
NYT in addition to the Wall Street Journal, it would have
<br>
received greater prominence.  (But then, perhaps the senders
<br>
realized that it wouldn't get much coverage at the NYT anyway?)
<br>
<p>Damien writes suggesting I checkout Melbourne's &quot;The Age&quot;
<br>
whose *lead* news item in the &quot;world&quot; section is entitled
<br>
&quot;Europeans Rally Behind Bush&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Go to the url and see for yourself. Go back to the top page:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/">http://www.theage.com.au/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; All I want is an objective news summary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the Age is a world class newspaper, and being Australian, it's run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by capitalists for profit (but then I always assumed the NYT is too), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlike many US newspapers its coverage is far from parochial.  Similarly with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aussie TV news: even the crassest commercial channel seems to have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planetary information than most US channels.  Since you can't get them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without being there, spend a few days reading the Age as well as your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper.  Report back.
</em><br>
<p>I will.  Thank you very much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm biased, can't be trusted.
</em><br>
<p>It is good when some of us are able to recognize that we have our own
<br>
ideological blinders.  I only wish that everyone here was capable of that.
<br>
<p>Lee
