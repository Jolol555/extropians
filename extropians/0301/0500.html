<p><em>&gt; &gt; (By the way, there is a huge difference between terminological

<em>&gt; &gt; disputes, which are comparatively trivial, and semantic ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which involve concepts.  Korzybski's general semanticists have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; succeeded in spreading the correct memes concerning the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  IMO.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've written a lot in this post and others now about the prudence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of extropians choosing to avoid the terms &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings&quot; when they actually mean persons or people and about using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative words for &quot;belief&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>We continue to disagree about what improvements in thinking
<br>
or behaving will obtain for most people if they used synonyms
<br>
for &quot;belief&quot; and &quot;human being&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't think that their behavior or effect would change much,
<br>
and you do.  But this is difficult and tricky terrain, in my
<br>
opinion, because it brushes right up against the way that
<br>
indeed the readiness to which certain words or memes come
<br>
to mind *does* affect behavior.
<br>
<p>Consider the &quot;Just Say No!&quot; anti-drug campaign.  What is the
<br>
chance that---just as in the case of advertising---the words
<br>
do bore themselves into the reflexes of people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see this not as an exercise in Newspeak but about adopting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, clearer, word-memes,
</em><br>
<p>boy, I guess you better read 1984 again!!  ;-)  (just joking)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and depriving those who would use these words in political forums
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working against extropian aspirations from appearing to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral high ground. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But am I getting anywhere at all?
</em><br>
<p>As I interpret your claim here, among the great unwashed masses
<br>
who regularly watch preachers on TV and are only to happy to send
<br>
them money, and among all those whose daily lives leave little
<br>
room for profound consideration of these topics, your fear is
<br>
that they succumb readily to pronouncements like &quot;I BELIEVE this.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, they are impressed or deeply affected when
<br>
someone says &quot;THIS I believe&quot; in the manner you have described.
<br>
<p>That's an empirical question, but I still would be surprised if you
<br>
were right.  It would mean that things were much sadder than even I
<br>
had thought, not being known for my optimism.
<br>
