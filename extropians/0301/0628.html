<em>&gt;&gt;Please clarify.  Do I understand you correctly as saying that no

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, the phrase &quot;natural rights&quot; packs a lot of meanings, I'm 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural rights advocates would offer an explanation suitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a materialist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If you don't know much about them then it seems pretty pointless 
<br>
and inflammatory to claim they are &quot;mythological&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But whereas I guess you see &quot;natural rights&quot; only a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit further down the ladder than &quot;legal rights&quot;---after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, they're very concrete things really, the latter---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we ought to consider &quot;natural rights&quot; as mythological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities.  
</em><br>
<p>I do not consider the simple fact that human beings have a 
<br>
specific nature as mythological.  Given a specific nature I find 
<br>
it difficult to escape the corollary that that nature implies 
<br>
certain requirements in settings with their fellow beings for 
<br>
best functioning.  Those ethical/social reguirements growing out 
<br>
of the nature of human beings is what I refer to as natural 
<br>
rights.  They are no more &quot;mythological&quot; than human beings are.
<br>
<p>I contend that any argument resting on &quot;natural
<br>
<em>&gt; rights&quot; is probably muddled.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I contend that any argument about human beings or any size 
<br>
aggregation of human beings that doesn't ground itself in the 
<br>
nature of such beings is hopelessly muddled and irrelevant from 
<br>
the get-go.
<br>
<p>If the only &quot;real&quot; rights are legal rights, the invention of 
<br>
some society or other, then on what grounds would you object to 
<br>
the inventions of some societies as opposed to the inventions of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;others?  On what grounds would you call a society &quot;evil&quot; re 
<br>
its treatment of its citizens?   How do you define what a &quot;good&quot; 
<br>
society would be like and what &quot;legal rights&quot; it would promote?
