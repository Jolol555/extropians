<em>&gt; &quot;I think we are more noble as Americans when we take our heritage seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to avoid entanglements all over the globe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaged in for highly questionable reasons and at very high costs at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels.  We have no business as a free people going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to war except in very clear circumstances.  Iraq is NOT such at this time.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, thanks for your comments.  I can only ask what would you consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those 'very clear' circumstances to be?  As free people, do we not value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom, and in doing so, wish freedom upon others? 
</em><br>
<p>Wishing freedom for others sure.  But freedom for others, even 
<br>
preserving freedom for oneself, is not consistent we attempting 
<br>
to establish it or abolish non-freedom all over the globe by force.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As extropians, I should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope that we prefer all humans, regardless of ethnicity, geography, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology live under a system which grants them basic constitutional rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By being 'anti-war' with regard to IRAQ, you are necessarily 'pro corrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous despotic dictator'  
</em><br>
<p>That does not in the least follow.  It is built on the 
<br>
presumption that war against Iraq will bring freedom to the 
<br>
Iraqi people.  It is also built on the notion that our desire to 
<br>
attack is somehow at least in part altruistic concern for the 
<br>
Iraqi people.  Both are extremely questionable.  Being aginst 
<br>
this war certainly does not mean I am pro Saddam.  This is false 
<br>
dichotomy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What of the IRAQ government, and Suddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner of oppression, do you find morally defensible?  Since a state is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a collection of individuals, the only moral states are ones that exist as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensions of individuals, IRAQ is no such state, it is built on murder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppression, corruption, and deceit.  Given this, I do not understand your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that we have 'no business' going there as 'free people'? Should we get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the habit of just not caring about people unless they are Americans?    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The rest of the above argument is based on a false dichotomy and 
<br>
thus is pointless rhetoric.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       Emancipation was not delivered by cousin Abe with his Emancipation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Proclamation but by my great great uncle (and thousands of others) lying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in the military graveyard in Nashville, Tennessee (and other places).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So all you understand and consider honorable is war, might, death and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction?  If so, then I pity you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War committed in an effort to free people and dispose of murderous dictators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is both 'honorable' and more importantly morally justified.  Do you consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'war' to never be honorable under ANY circumstances?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The people of Iraq did not ask for any such intervention.  Nor 
<br>
are we obligated to do such if they did.  And such an argument 
<br>
is not in the least the primary argument that is driving us 
<br>
toward war.
<br>
<p>I consider war honorable to stop a major and highly expansionist 
<br>
evil such as Hitler.  Although it would have been far cheaper 
<br>
and more moral to have stopped him by more peaceful means much 
<br>
earlier.  Despite a lot of rhetoric, Saddam is simply not in 
<br>
that class.  I consider war moral to defends one's home and 
<br>
country.  But Saddam is at worse a very small threat to us.  I 
<br>
don't consider war justified to preemptively destroy any 
<br>
possible threat to us anywhere and everywhere in the world 
<br>
regardless of national borders and sovereignity.  That itself is 
<br>
extremely warlike and an honorable reason to go to war - against 
<br>
any country that would act in such a manner.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;What is this &quot;we&quot;?  You will sit this one out due to age and cheer other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;boys&quot; on to their death in a more senseless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict than even Vietnam was.  Bully for you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the events that transpired in Indochina after the peace and anti war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocates 'won' and forced the US to abandon Indochina to the corrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despotic murderous regimes of Mao, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Min and the Soviet Union,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the resultant millions who were murdered or killed, I do not understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how one can consider the Vietnam war 'senseless'.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We pulled out of a senseless war.  Our handling of that war had 
<br>
more than a little to do with the final outcome.  The US had no 
<br>
legitimate business in Vietnam to start with.  Our actions there 
<br>
, including our illegal actions in neighboring countries gave 
<br>
fuel to Pol Pot.  The rest of your laundry list in no way 
<br>
justified what we did there or that we were there at all.  I do 
<br>
not see how anyone could judge the reasons and consequences to 
<br>
this country (US) as anything other than senseless.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps what was 'senseless' about it was that, in addition to many poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military decisions and political decisions, was that we gave up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abandoned those people to collectivization and labor camps.  I hope that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same thing does not happen here, and that we do not abandon the IRAQI people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the hands of a murderous meglomoniacal dictator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Puhleeze, we are not going in there for the sake of the Iraqi 
<br>
people.  Pretense that we are is sickening.
