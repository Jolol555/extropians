<p>
&nbsp;To start, the subject of Dolly's arthritis. I have had a quick thought about 
<br>
this one. I have suffered from arthritis of the neck and shoulder since the 
<br>
age of 20. This wasn't due to some genetic problem, just an unfortunate 
<br>
accident.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sometimes makes me loose sleep, it is a constant annoyance and 
<br>
there has been days where suicide has seemed an option.  On reflection I 
<br>
can't see how I would be better off dead because of this affliction, whether 
<br>
genetic in cause or not. Likewise I cannot see how Dolly would be better off 
<br>
dead in her case. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree with Lee's Healthy &gt; Unhealthy &gt; Null explanation and 
<br>
would site Steven Hawkin as an example. Is he better off dead now? Is 
<br>
Christopher Reeve? No
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two men's cases are obviously not the same as a clone born with 
<br>
a genetically determined affliction, but they do make you think about where 
<br>
we draw the line through when life is and isn't worth living. In addition 
<br>
they both show why we need to develop cloning technology.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have never been to a special education school for the 
<br>
profoundly disabled. I would recommend it before passing judgement on what 
<br>
quality of life is worth living. A room full of smiles and happy children can 
<br>
show you that despite being in profound pain and suffering or having 
<br>
disabilities that make grown men cry just thinking about them. It is very 
<br>
hard to draw the line on what is expectable. Even If a clone was born 
<br>
profoundly disabled, I couldn't say it was better off dead. In fact I would 
<br>
say the opposite. Some of the happiest people I know are disabled and after 
<br>
all. Isn't happiness the point of life?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only see cloning as a good thing. It is inevitable that there 
<br>
will be clones born with abnormalities. Doing it the good ole fashion way 
<br>
isn't exactly the safest thing in the world. These cases of abnormality due 
<br>
to the cloning process will rapidly decrease as our knowledge grows and I 
<br>
honestly cant see any clone coming to term with such an ailment that would 
<br>
render their life not worth living.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the arguments I have heard against cloning are about the 
<br>
irrational fears of what we will do with these clones. Great unstoppable 
<br>
armies, better make them immune from every pathogen on the planet! Slave 
<br>
labour, please! Hideously deformed mutants,!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don't we just replace the word Clone with Twin in every doom sayer 
<br>
paper on the subject and reread them? I know a few Twins and funnily enough 
<br>
they have never tried to take over the world, have never been used for 
<br>
scientific experimentation, have the same civil rights as the rest of us and 
<br>
as far as hideously deformed mutants. well they may not be the pretiest 
<br>
people, but I think that is a bit harsh.
<br>
<p>Didn't we have most of these arguements and fears when IVF first produced a 
<br>
baby? Can anyone remember?
