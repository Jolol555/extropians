</em><br>
<em>&gt;     not in religion, not in faith, but on logic.&quot;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who is correct?
</em><br>
<p>Parts of the two statements may be equivalent, but are equivalent only if 
<br>
the speaker defines vis concepts such that &quot;belief&quot; and &quot;working 
<br>
hypothesis&quot; are coextensional, which is true for only a very restricted 
<br>
class of speakers.
<br>
<p>The statement &quot;I believe that any other points we might choose are 
<br>
essentially arbitrary and uncertain&quot; appears in A but not in B.  B might 
<br>
cite it as support for the selection of the working hypothesis.
<br>
<p>As a listener, when I read A I hear a tone of finality, and when I read B 
<br>
I hear a tone of tentativeness.  I can interpret A to be in correspondence 
<br>
with B, but if I heard them as statements from different speakers in an 
<br>
ordinary discussion with the ordinary prior probabilities of various kinds 
<br>
of speakers, I would guess that A had come to a definite conclusion and 
<br>
that B was uncertain of verself, and that A probably had substantially 
<br>
different views of the matter than B.
