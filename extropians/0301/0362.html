<p>
I was rethinking and a society would only be dominant if it had a meme to do 
<br>
so. Take the religions for example. Those societies had memes which didn't 
<br>
allow them to conquer other societies (just because they could, other 
<br>
justification was required). In this way those memes allowed the sharing of 
<br>
other memes between societies giving both societies an advantage. The 
<br>
societies who had memes that allowed them to conquer other societies would 
<br>
be at a disadvantage because an equality of shared memes would be impossible 
<br>
between the conquered society and the society of the conquerors.
<br>
<p>This creates a interconnected balance of memes in each society depending on 
<br>
the relationship that society has with the other societies it communicates 
<br>
with.
<br>
<p>However, this interconnected balance of memes have certain advantages and 
<br>
disadvantages compared to other societies interconnected balance of memes.
<br>
<p>Scientific memes give rise to many advantages.  Religous memes also give 
<br>
rise to many advantages. It is the society that can balance both these memes 
<br>
to get the maximum advantages and the minimum disadvantages that will be the 
<br>
most successful.
<br>
<p>Ex) Religious theory in present day has few advantages that are not also 
<br>
advantages of Human rights-morality theories. It makes perfect sense to 
<br>
discard the theory of religion to balance science so that it have more 
<br>
advantages. In doing so our society only loses a few advantages in religion 
<br>
and gains massive advantages in science.
