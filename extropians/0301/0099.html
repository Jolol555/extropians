<p><em>&gt;... I ask you, what moral claim does a country have

to

<br>
make ANY moral claim to 
<br>
existence? Does it have a 'right' to exist? Since it
<br>
does not respect 
<br>
rights of individuals, it clearly can make no claims
<br>
to rights. It is a 
<br>
nation built on oppression, threats, pain, and
<br>
murder.&gt;
<br>
<p>And???? Like is there another kind of nation state?
<br>
<p>But, people will ride whatever horse is going their
<br>
direction, generally.  What I find amusing, when I can
<br>
get beyond being p...d off, is the cultural claims of
<br>
the S. CA Aztlan (sp?) community.  Surely one of the
<br>
most thoroughly anti-human, anti-rights, anti-anthing
<br>
worthwhile, regimes in all of history was the Aztecs. 
<br>
I understand that the total population of Mexico was
<br>
actually on the decline BEFORE the Conquistedores
<br>
arrived, due to the ever mounting demands of the Aztec
<br>
Gods for blood from the captive nations, who somehow
<br>
lost all their rights to exist.
<br>
<p>Worse yet, if possible, it now appears likely that the
<br>
Aztecs were responsible for the death of the Anistasi
<br>
culture, by infecting it with their bloody rituals and
<br>
superstitions.  Don't know how many of you caught that
<br>
episode of &quot;Secrets of the Dead.&quot; Quite an amazing
<br>
piece of forensic work that.
<br>
<p>Despite all this, the notion of multi-culturalism
<br>
excuses all.  So the local Hispanic community, whose
<br>
income levels have at last notice continued to decline
<br>
relative to most other groups, continues to cling to a
<br>
mindless beligerance, a tacit support of criminal
<br>
elements, an incredible level of alcoholism, drug
<br>
abuse, and sexual battery and rape, and the
<br>
maintenance of an atmosphere at home and in their
<br>
&quot;hoods&quot; that makes it virtually impossible for the
<br>
kids to escape (if you can't ever get a decent night's
<br>
sleep, due to the cars with a boom going by every 10
<br>
minutes, then it's really hard to succeed
<br>
scholastically) - altho a few do and often disappear
<br>
into the Anglo world, happy to reject a truly stupid
<br>
and destructive memetic complex.
<br>
<p>But that further concentrates the lumpen stupid
<br>
elements, until they find their way to prison or a
<br>
bloody death.  What a mess!  And listen to all the
<br>
&quot;progressives&quot; defending that &quot;culture,&quot; providing a
<br>
moral sanction that they couldn't possibly acquire on
<br>
their own, a la Chomsky.
