</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The raving US American nationalists that have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; largely hijacked this list since September 11,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2001 (and diverted it from Extropian themes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atavistic talk securely rooted in the frame of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mind of the nation states from the first half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the 20th century
</em><br>
<p>I haven't heard anyone &quot;raving&quot; on either side.  Yes, some
<br>
speak more emotionally than others, but it's all pretty
<br>
rational IMO, even the most uncompromising contributors
<br>
(e.g. Ron and Kai).
<br>
<p>This list was *not* hijacked ;-)  There has always been
<br>
a healthy IMO variety of political and extropian themes
<br>
discussed here.  One can pick and choose what one attends
<br>
to, which for some of us even depends on mood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;--but I digress)
</em><br>
<p>says Ron:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;        I don't think you digressed, at least not very much if at all.  If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America is reduced to an impotent mess exactly how do you think this will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affect the world the Extropians are hoping to build?  When Europe is second 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the list of people to be reduced to impotence where will the Extropian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world be then?
</em><br>
<p>It seems quite exaggerated to talk of either of these nations
<br>
or nation-groups being &quot;reduced to an impotent mass (or &quot;mess&quot;)&quot;.
<br>
What you seem to be talking about is something like as follows:
<br>
if the U.S., U.K., and their friends do not depose Saddam Hussein,
<br>
then a &quot;green light&quot; will be given all sorts of 3rd world dictators
<br>
and brutal tyrants.  Some people really do respect only force.
<br>
<p>But even so, the U.S. and Europe could sit comparatively comfortably
<br>
by, given the worst that the terrorists could do.  Do you realize how
<br>
hard it would be for the terrorists to put the vast U.S.A. and 
<br>
Europe through the same treatment they've put Israel through?
<br>
And yet to this day, four times as many Israelis are killed in
<br>
automobile accidents than by terrorists.  The sad truth (for
<br>
the Islamic civilization) is that the West is sitting pretty
<br>
no matter what happens.  (I still agree with you that an invasion
<br>
is likely to be the correct move for the West, though.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Or could you possibly mean that Sadaam and Osama will now turn into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lambs and peaceably lie down together to chew their cuds?  If so I can't see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how you could possibly come to that conclusion.
</em><br>
<p>Surely you know that that *exaggerates* their views!  Yet it's
<br>
true that if they reflected on just how inaction by the West
<br>
will be perceived there, it only eggs them on and makes their
<br>
attacks worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        My interpretation, and this is surely no surprise, of your attitude is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you do see a threat to [us] Americans and you are quite willing to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifice America to your short term safety.
</em><br>
<p>Sacrifice?  Surely you jest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But [I] and many other Americans will not stand still to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow your vision for our future to come to pass.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, ;-), yeah, sure, there are always a number of people,
<br>
even including Americans, who are so resentful of the U.S.
<br>
that they'd be secretly glad if the whole thing sunk under
<br>
the waves in some cataclysm.  I dunno, though; I didn't get
<br>
the impression that Christian or even Kai is that far gone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For that you pull out your curse, &quot;Nationalists.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        When I say the time for talking is over I mean only that it is time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for you to recognize that we not going to be destroyed by the likes of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sadaam/Osama without exerting ourselves to the fullest.  Nor or we going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be endlessly sidetracked into an impotent debate by Europeans that privately 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate us and wish to see us fall -- like you.
</em><br>
<p>Besides, it would be sheer fantasy for anyone to suppose
<br>
that the U.S. is going away.  But again, there is just NO
<br>
WAY that Saddam or Osama can seriously hurt the U.S.  Yes,
<br>
9-11 was bad, and traumatic.  But don't forget, the population
<br>
of the U.S. that day did not decrease!  Instead of going up
<br>
7,000+ per day, it went up only 3,000 or so.  The GNP for
<br>
2001 and 2002 have both been well into the black.
<br>
<p>In fact, if you didn't read newspapers or watch TV, you'd
<br>
never have known that anything happened.  Yeah, a lot of
<br>
people put flags on their cars, but it could have meant
<br>
that they were rooting for a U.S. Olympic team.
<br>
<p>World War II was the last time that you would have noticed
<br>
anything (slightly) funny here:  a lot of women working,
<br>
and a lot of men seemingly absent, and severe gasoline
<br>
rationing.  But even then, we are lucky that unless you
<br>
were observant, you'd hardly have noticed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        You called our position &quot;incredibly distorted.&quot;   I see yours as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly cold and self serving.
</em><br>
<p>Exaggerations all around, clearly.  Those of us on this list
<br>
who favor invasion cannot be said to be &quot;incredibly distorted&quot;.
<br>
Many of the most judicial commentators, long known for their
<br>
restraint and sobriety on this list, consider it a difficult
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>But how could their point of view be &quot;incredibly self-serving&quot;?
<br>
Unless you mean that, internally to their own psychology they
<br>
are extremely eager to see American foreign policy reverses.
<br>
Maybe.  But the fall of Iraq would ultimately benefit them too,
<br>
and besides, their countries get no great benefit from the U.S.
<br>
not settling scores in the Mid-East.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You want to see our citizenry killed,
</em><br>
<p>Please find ONE SINGLE POST in the history of this
<br>
list that backs up your claim.  You're being ridiculous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you want to see us threatened by further injury [doubtful]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you want to see us stand quietly until we are hurt again. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you've got that right.  That's EXACTLY what the
<br>
critics of a current invasion want.  Just turn the other
<br>
cheek.
<br>
<p>Ah, phooey!  Iraq will get its just desserts, and the
<br>
European critics you refer to can even watch it on TV.
<br>
Serves 'em right.  ;-)
