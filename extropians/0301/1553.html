<p>True.  Light sails were his first love, and an area in
<br>
which he was getting patents before he was deeply involved
<br>
in nanotech.  At the first west coast nanocon in 1990, I
<br>
was carrying a government-funded study of solar sails,
<br>
to which he had contributed some papers.  He saw me with
<br>
it and came up and started a conversation.  With me.  I
<br>
was so in shock.
<br>
<p>Those of you who know Eric know he is a quiet reserved
<br>
type.  Get him talking about solar sails.  Learn about
<br>
them first.  In his early lectures on nanotechnology
<br>
that was always included.  The medical stuff came later.
<br>
These days, Foresight's concern seems to be focussed on
<br>
the danger of military and terrorist nanotech.
