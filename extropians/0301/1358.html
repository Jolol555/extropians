<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;So far Bush is doing a very poor job convincing anybody that he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;right in attacking Irak. Especially the arab countries are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;convinced it is all just a ploy to get cheap oil. Exactly the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;turned Osama and many other arabs against the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;USA. So how can that be a long term solution?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The fact that Sadam is a murderous racist tyrant despotic dictator is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;justification enough. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;With no or little consequences and death to only him and his direct guard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and troops that *might* be enough. But this is far from the case.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So because you feel 'innocents' might be killed, we should do nothing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sadam?
</em><br>
<p>To which Samantha responds: 
<br>
<p>&quot;You should not do things that make the situation likely worse 
<br>
for the people, the region and ourselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>Where is the evidence to support this assertion? As a reader of many foreign 
<br>
policy annuals, I have heard the argument that US policy in the region would 
<br>
lead to a series of revolutions that would place extremist followers of Islam 
<br>
at the head of these countries. This has been a popular argument since before 
<br>
the Gulf War, and I have yet to see this occur. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we can not attack IRAQ unless we only kill or remove him and his direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guard and troops. What about his Son? What about his supporters? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about his political leadership and infrastructure? What about the soliders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing in his way, shall we politley ask them to step out of the way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about his aresnal? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;So now you want to eliminate all who might think like him. Some 
<br>
&quot;democracy&quot; and free country you are attempting to set up there.&quot;
<br>
<p>Oh come on Samantha, now you are just being ridiculous. Michael is obviously 
<br>
referring to the need to destroy the ruling capabilities and infrastructure 
<br>
of Saddam and his followers. Do you object that we did the same thing to the 
<br>
Nazis?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The fact that Europeans do not find this as a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;justification is a testament to the liberalized moral relativist notions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;prevalent in Europe at the moment. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This is nothing but empty rhetoric.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your following response demonstates otherwise. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The latest polls show that 70% of the American people believe we should 
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt; use military means at this time, that we should give more time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspections and diplomatic means. Of course you can make your empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accusations against them also. But at some point you really need to notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a great deal of the world and of US people do not believe this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct course of action. Call them whatever names you will, the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are against you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A great deal of people in the world think that thier feelings could manage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to alter the course of a single spec of dust in the universe, believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stars tell their futures, and drinking urine in the morning is healthy.
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Excuse me. Are you going off on this rant in order to dismiss 
<br>
the wishes of the majority of the people when you claim to 
<br>
support democracy? For shame!&quot;
<br>
<p>No, as he points out later all he's doing is pointing out that a stance's 
<br>
popularity does not make it correct.
<br>
<p><p>As
<br>
<em>&gt; the numbers were also 'anti war' the vietnam era, and that cost the lives 
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; 3 million indochinese people, I must appeal to the fallacy of logic known 
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; argumentum ad populum, just because more people say something, doesn't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it more likely to be right.
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Of course not. But in a democracy the people are supposed to 
<br>
have a very substantial voice.&quot;
<br>
<p>And they do, they're called elections. Bush has been chosen to lead this 
<br>
country for four years, he doesn't need to check back with the chattering 
<br>
classes every time a large decision comes up. Political leaders cannot be 
<br>
hamstrung by opinion polls. Using that logic, FDR should never have aided the 
<br>
British and the Soviets, Truman should have never intervened in Korea, among 
<br>
a host of other such monumentally important decisions. If Bush does a poor 
<br>
job, we have a fail- safe mechanism to get rid of him. It too is called an 
<br>
election. The Iraqis, you might have noticed in spite of what CNN would have 
<br>
us believe, have no such option.
<br>
<p>&quot;How many Indochinese people did we ourselves kill btw?&quot;
<br>
<p>This is precisely the moral equivalency nonsense that everyone is calling you 
<br>
on. By implication you are suggesting that the cause of the United States and 
<br>
that of the Indochinese totalitarians were morally equivalent. As I have 
<br>
attempted to point out, ad nauseum, MORE PEOPLE DIED IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS 
<br>
OF THE COMMUNIST &quot;PEACE&quot; THAN DIED IN THE ELEVEN- YEAR CONFLICT TO PREVENT 
<br>
THEIR VICTORY. Does our killing of North Vietnamese troops in Cambodia 
<br>
somehow justify Pol Pot's extermination of 1/3 OF HIS POPULATION? Does our 
<br>
bombing of Hanoi in December 1972 which killed 1600 people justify Ho's &quot;land 
<br>
reform&quot; program which caused the deaths of 50,000 of his own people? Does the 
<br>
My Lai incident, where US troops murdered 100 civilians, justify the North 
<br>
Vietnamese's occupation of the city of Hue in February 1968, in which they 
<br>
massacred 4000 people, roughly 25% of the city's population? Again, you act 
<br>
as an apologist for one of the most sadistic and barbaric regimes of the 20th 
<br>
Century by attempting to explain away or ignore their atrocities because &quot;we 
<br>
killed people too.&quot; The per-capita income in South Vietnam in 1973 was 
<br>
roughly 500 dollars. Today, in Communist Vietnam, it has not yet reached 300 
<br>
dollars! Whatever your opinions of our involvement in the war, whatever 
<br>
others may believe your role in the outcome might have been, the point 
<br>
remains the United States was clearly not the villain in Indochina. To argue 
<br>
that they were, or that is unclear who really was, is absolutely ludicrous.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;How much of the result was made worse by our own actions?&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, you shift the blame from those that deserve it. For what purpose I 
<br>
cannot fathom. Ho's collectivization program had already taken the lives of 
<br>
50,000 North Vietnamese by 1958, years before the first US combat troops 
<br>
landed in Danang. In Cambodia, as Molyda Szymusiak ( a Cambodian holocaust 
<br>
survivor) points out in her powerful book, The Stones Cry Out, the Khmer 
<br>
Rouge had already begun moving against the Sihanouk government in late 1967, 
<br>
BEFORE THE US BOMBING CAMPAIGN OR TROOP INCURSION OCCURRED. It was always the 
<br>
plan of Le Duan and the Hanoi politburo to hand Cambodia to the KR. The US 
<br>
actions were responsible for delaying this outcome, not causing it.
<br>
<p>&quot;These things would be difficult to evaluate well.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is simply moral relativist hogwash. Some of our actions and tactics in 
<br>
Indochina can be legitimately debated. The question as to who was to blame 
<br>
for the holocaust and resulting human hell in that region cannot be.
<br>
<p>&quot;But blaming any/all bad results on those who cried for us 
<br>
to get out of Vietnam and stop the huge drain on this nation is 
<br>
obviously unbalanced and unfair argumentation.&quot;
<br>
<p>With all due respect, that is hardly the message that one would take from 
<br>
demonstrators waving Communist flags and chanting &quot;Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh is 
<br>
gonna win.&quot; And to suggest that the protests played no role in improving 
<br>
Communist morale, as some have done, is also disingenuous. Bui Tin, who 
<br>
accepted the South Vietnamese surrender in 1975, said in his memoir, &quot;Every 
<br>
day our leadership would listen to world news over the radio at 9 am to 
<br>
follow the growth of the American anti-war movement. Visits to Hanoi by 
<br>
people like Jane Fonda and Ramsey Clark gave us confidence to hold on in the 
<br>
face of battlefield reverses.&quot; 
<br>
<p>This same majority of people (such as yourself)
<br>
<em>&gt; think its ok that 3 million indochinese people were murdered by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansionistic communist regime.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Boring. I said no such thing and I am damn tired of you being 
<br>
tiresome enough to make such a silly charge.&quot;
<br>
<p>But you have yet to refute this assertion by criticizing the Hanoi regime. 
<br>
Instead, you simply fall back on thirty year old arguments like &quot;how many did 
<br>
we kill&quot;, as if that excuses one of the worst holocausts in the 20th Century. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;I am done with this topic.&quot;
<br>
<p>There is no reason to take the &quot;I'm taking my ball and going home&quot; stance. It 
<br>
is not being malicious to ask, as many of us have, that you clarify your 
<br>
positions on the Indochina Wars with evidence that substantiates your 
<br>
position.
