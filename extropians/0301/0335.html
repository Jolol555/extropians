</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  I think plutinos and other Kuiper belt objects are the future
<br>
frontier for humanity!
<br>
<p>There are tens of thousands of these planetoids on the edge of the solar
<br>
system.  Unlike the rocky asteroids in the inner asteroid belt, these have
<br>
water ice and CO2.  That means they can easily be self-sustaining.  Oxygen
<br>
to breath, Hydrogen to burn, water to drink, carbon for structures and
<br>
organics.  What more could you want?  They even have pretty hefty gravity
<br>
for their size.  Smaller objects have more gravity than one might expect,
<br>
due to the surface being closer to the core.  Pluto is 1/455 of earth, but
<br>
has 1/15 the gravity.  These planetoids also can have thin atmospheres, like
<br>
Pluto.  They are round like planets.  They are usually red in color due to
<br>
ancient organic chemistry from the beginnings of the solar system.  Maps of
<br>
Pluto show that they have lighter and darker areas, seasonal changes, and
<br>
complicated geologies.  And don't forget that some people are predicting a
<br>
liquid ocean on Charon, Pluto's moon.  The tidal forces of the double
<br>
planetoid could raise the temperature to comfortable levels.  If 10% of
<br>
planetoids have moons, it is conceivably possible that there could be
<br>
hundreds or thousands of liquid oceans capable of sustaining life in the
<br>
Kuiper belt!
<br>
<p>These things are literally like little planets and not like the irregular
<br>
chunks of rock found in the inner asteroid belt.  Somewhere between now and
<br>
the time we colonize thousands of planets across the galaxy, I envision a
<br>
period of colonization on the edge of the solar system.  Thousands of
<br>
separate worlds, each self-sustaining, and each far away from the others.
<br>
Space is so vast out there that the larger objects are many AU apart from
<br>
each other.  These are not close-knit neighbors, but far-flung worlds.
<br>
There are more worlds in the Kuiper belt than in hundreds of solar systems
<br>
as we used to envision them.  This is a much bigger frontier and much closer
<br>
and more accessible than the sci-fi stellar colonization we imagined only a
<br>
decade ago.  We will undoubtedly colonize these worlds much sooner and much
<br>
faster than stellar colonization.  And these worlds would make great
<br>
gateways to the stars.  They also have smaller gravity wells which makes
<br>
launches and inter-world travel cheaper.
<br>
<p>Plutinos or Bust!
