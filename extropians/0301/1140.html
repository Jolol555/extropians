<em>&gt; &gt; I've never understood why people can't simply do as I                         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do, and cooperatively express their views in the voting                       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; booth?  And if they have more energy and time than it                         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; takes for than, then in discussions with others, and in                       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; writing articles and books?                                                   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One vote isn't worth the chads it produces. They are on the streets in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to influence other voters, and it's their constitutional right to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so.
</em><br>
<p>I actually said as much in a part you didn't quote.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Physical protests may be a waste of energy compared to articles and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books, but not everyone is gifted in the literary realm.  Furthermore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling the Extropians list with this war debate (am as guilty as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody) is the electronic equivalent of a big, rowdy picket-line,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't it?
</em><br>
<p>Not at all!  Picket lines intimidate, and often are threatening.
<br>
Marches disturb the peace, and also at least symbolically 
<br>
threaten violence.
<br>
<p>My main question in this thread, however
<br>
<p><em>  &gt; &gt; What I have always wondered about is a Kantian take on
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; all this:  what if everyone took to the streets to make
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; &gt; their voices and views on issues heard? 
</em><br>
<p>goes unanswered.  While on the other hand, there is no harm
<br>
whatsoever, and even some benefit, for people to express
<br>
their thoughts to each other in chat rooms, or email lists,
<br>
or via other modes of communication.
<br>
<p>Why do some think it their prerogative to take to the streets
<br>
whenever they're unhappy about something?  (Note again: I am
<br>
definitely not objecting to their legal right to do so!)  Why
<br>
can't they do as they would have their political opposition
<br>
do, namely, assemble freely (in halls and other suitable places),
<br>
communicate as I said, and not take to the streets?
<br>
