<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; What do you some of you think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the family in the context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; transhumanism and Extropianism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think family is a potent meme. And with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific validity we can adopt it, extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it, and validly use it, as part of a pleasant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theme of inclusivity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about new family forms in the context of future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes?
</em><br>
<p>I have a broad mind about future family forms because I 
<br>
come from a baseline perspective that *every* person living
<br>
on the planet is a more or less distant genetic relative of 
<br>
*every* other person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What exactly do you mean by &quot;scientific validity&quot; here?
</em><br>
<p>Bryan Sykes wrote a book the &quot;Seven Daughters of Eve&quot; 
<br>
which purports, quite credibly I think, to use small changes in
<br>
mitochondrial DNA passed down the maternal line to show 
<br>
that all people of European decent can trace their lineages back
<br>
to only 7 women, the oldest of which was 45,000 years ago. It
<br>
is also possible using the Y chromosome which can only be 
<br>
inherited from the father to produce a paternal lineage map.
<br>
<p>Sykes reckons once you get out of Europe and look at Africa
<br>
the &quot;cradle of civilization&quot; that the maternal lines go back much
<br>
much further. But one of his key findings was that there 
<br>
appears to be no evidence of Neanderthal genes in modern 
<br>
homo sapiens. This caused him and others to conclude that
<br>
various populations of homo sapiens did not emerge from or
<br>
breed successfully with Neanderthal populations, rather it looks
<br>
like there is likely to be an original African &quot;Eve&quot; from which we
<br>
are all descended.
<br>
<p>So I reckon that as we are all genetically related, (to the best of
<br>
my knowledge), and genetics is pretty scientific, the argument 
<br>
can be made that all homo sapiens are members of an extended
<br>
biological family as a matter of science fact not merely as a matter
<br>
of culture.
<br>
<p>Against this background it would seem hard to oppose any 
<br>
particular groups of people getting together however arbitrarily
<br>
and calling themselves family if they wish to. Scientifically they 
<br>
are likely to be right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In Horwitz's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper, I think he's approaching family as a social phenomena. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, to some extent, he's assuming it exists and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyzing it along various axes.
</em><br>
<p>In fairness I've printed but not yet read Horwitz's paper so I'm
<br>
talking more generally and responding to you, not to it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Especially now that it looks like homo sapiens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arose in one location in Africa rather than in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a number of places separately.  Could work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very well against the darker memes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pop up or are invoked from time to time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such as?  How?
</em><br>
<p>Well its my contention, one that's often not shared so far as I
<br>
can tell, that some people outside of transhumanist circles in 
<br>
particular may on superficial examination, or if encouraged to
<br>
think that way by  mischief makers see transhumanism as an 
<br>
elitist movement. Add the obvious interest in biological
<br>
enhancements etc and I think sadly it is all too easy for outsiders
<br>
to quite inappropriately draw connections between transhumans
<br>
that aspire to be better and other groups in history that aspired to
<br>
be better in far less wholesome ways. I don't want to revisit a
<br>
thread we've just had. Think of the arch fiend of the twentieth
<br>
century and his regime and fixation with eugenics and you know 
<br>
both what I mean and what dark memes or spectres are able to
<br>
be summoned up against any group that looks like it might even
<br>
be thinking of drawing distinctions between transhumans and
<br>
mere humans.  Seems to me, that exclaiming (metaphorically), 
<br>
that transhumanists *know* we're all part of the same extended
<br>
family and we *know* this because of science not some fuzzy 
<br>
cultural guff could be a nice counter-balancing meme of 
<br>
inclusiveness with respect to people generally that can be tossed
<br>
back in response to charges of exclusiveness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What of the meme of &quot;meme&quot;?  That powerful meme might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a few would  be memeticists entranced.:)
</em><br>
<p>Indeed it might :-)   How would one tell do you think?
