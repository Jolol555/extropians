<br>
<p><em>&gt; Morality is a function over 4D spacetimes, not 3D spaces.  If you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminate an existing mind, the termination event is undesirable. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Declining to create a *new* unhappy mind is not morally equivalent to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *killing* an unhappy mind.... instantiating a particular mind has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no effect; it already has a Platonic existence or whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  Whether or not a mind or program obtains actual execution
<br>
time is extremely important in any consistent value system I know
<br>
of.  It is as ludicrous to suppose that starting execution of a
<br>
process has no effect as it would be to suppose that termination
<br>
of a process has no effect.
<br>
<p>Declining to create a &quot;new unhappy mind&quot; is not legally equivalent
<br>
to killing an &quot;unhappy mind&quot;, but morally?  This must be carefully
<br>
examined.  Now if A and B are two pre-existing minds symmetrically
<br>
related, then A's termination of B indeed does violate traditional
<br>
morality:  in terms of game theory, A is defecting, not cooperating;
<br>
in terms of familiar morality, A is contravening the Golden Rule.
<br>
<p>But what about the case where a pre-existing pattern, whether it's
<br>
on disk or in platonic space, is to be issued run time?
<br>
<p>Suppose that I have written a screen-saver which is necessarily
<br>
much more primitive than I am.  Who will decide whether it has
<br>
a mind?  We can either presume to determine a potentially NP
<br>
incomplete set of rules and impose them globally, or we can
<br>
allow such decisions to be made locally, and refrain from the
<br>
use of force.  It should be up to me whether or not and to what
<br>
degree my screen-saver is pre-empted by other tasks, whether
<br>
my screen-saver is placed on an extinction schedule where it
<br>
gets 1 second of run time per 10^10^n seconds (where n is the
<br>
execution count), or whether my screen-saver is terminated
<br>
by me and another written to replace it.
<br>
<p>If indeed we are living in a simulation, then the chances are
<br>
extremely good that the simulation was created by someone who
<br>
is free to interrupt it.  That Entity who some call God would
<br>
have little incentive to have authored our existence were He
<br>
under the threat of dire punishment from an even higher source.
