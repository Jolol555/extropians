In a message dated 1/31/2003 11:44:17 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:kmb@cameron.kn-bremen.de?Subject=Re:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">kmb@cameron.kn-bremen.de</a> writes: BTW, I'm still curious, when Mr. Bush will 
<br>
go against Pakistan (A-bombs, pro-Taliban), North Korea (A-bombs, probably 
<br>
pro-terrorist) or several other countries...
<br>
<p>Kai,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American people by a very narrow margin hired Mr. Bush to be our 
<br>
President.  As such he is our Chief Executive Officer and Commander in Chief. 
<br>
&nbsp;We don't ask him to lay out all his plans to the public or to foreign 
<br>
nations.  Under our systems he keeps in touch with our Congress (which we the 
<br>
people also hired) to keep them appraised of his plans until such time as the 
<br>
information comes just too late to help those that would harm us.  Unless he 
<br>
keeps the congress satisfied of the wisdom of his plans they won't permit him 
<br>
to go to war nor will they give him the money that is required.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is just a brief technical description of our system.  But as you 
<br>
can see he has had to reveal his step by step plans to our public servants -- 
<br>
you &amp; I will find out the answer to your questions in due course.  If his 
<br>
plans are not satisfying we will dispose of him and them in the next 
<br>
election.
<br>
Ron h.
