<br>
Clinton's goons.  Though I am attracted to working for the Defense Department 
<br>
in IT, the secrecy and near extraterritoriality of the US military within the 
<br>
US does give me tremendous pause.  I think I'll either do IT as an educator 
<br>
or private sector mployee.  - Bill.
<br>
<p>I don't blame you Bill.  I have talked before on this list of having been in 
<br>
Navy Flight School back in the Navy.  I guess most guys go through there like 
<br>
I do and they never participate in anything.  Still you see things and you 
<br>
hear stories.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However before flight school when I was flying as a radioman in a 
<br>
seaplane squadron we got a requisition for one flight crew to ferry a PBY 
<br>
(Early 1955 AD) to Taiwan.  The volunteers wore civies until the delivery was 
<br>
made and perhaps on the trip back to the states.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since flight school one friend has told me of being hired by what was 
<br>
obviously the CIA to fly a smaller seaplane (One of the smaller Grumans, I 
<br>
can't remember which) to some near Cuba location and to return.  Naturally no 
<br>
uniforms were used.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But notice that your story and both of mine would perhaps provide the 
<br>
US government plausable deniablity but within our government there was still 
<br>
a route that provided accountability.
