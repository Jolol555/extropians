In 1900, Argentina was the 6th wealthiest country in the world.
<br>
What happened?
<br>
<p>Does anyone know of a book that chronicles all the bad moves
<br>
made by that nation?
<br>
<p>Yes, it's usually best to focus on wealth creation, and to regard
<br>
poverty as mankind's default state.  But the rapid decline of a
<br>
once-mighty economic power must contain valuable lessons.
<br>
<p>The latest mistake was apparently taking the peso off the
<br>
dollar, which instantly cheated thousands of deep pockets
<br>
out of 3/4 their wealth.  And, more importantly, sent the
<br>
message that capital that wished to survive had better 
<br>
flee the country.
<br>
<p>I heard also that the government had agreed to pick up
<br>
the bill for any cosmetic surgery desired by a citizen.
<br>
This is starting to sound like a case where the usual
<br>
damage inflicted on an economy by socialist tendencies
<br>
turned out to be too much, and killed it off.  In other
<br>
words, the government spent itself to death.  And had 
<br>
to start printing pesos?
