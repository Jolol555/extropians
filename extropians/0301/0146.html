Maybe it's not necessary to explore those esoteric notions of identity
<br>
in order to make my point.  Try looking at the cloning issue from the
<br>
point of view of maximizing extropy.  We want there to be the greatest
<br>
number of people with the greatest potential for growing and changing and
<br>
improving themselves.  Whether cloning advances extropy or not depends
<br>
on the specifics.
<br>
<p>Suppose something terrible happened to the human race and everyone lost
<br>
the ability to reproduce, except for some reason through cloning, even
<br>
with the limited cloning technology that we have today.  I think virtually
<br>
everyone would agree that in that circumstance, cloning would be the right
<br>
thing to do.  Even though the resulting children might face significant
<br>
hardships, they would still have a fighting chance at a worthwhile future.
<br>
<p>If I am right and people agree about this, it suggests to me that we
<br>
aren't really worried about birth defects and issues of consent per
<br>
se; but rather, we object to cloning precisely because there is an
<br>
alternative.  It's not that giving birth in a manner which is dangerous
<br>
to the child is wrong in itself, but that doing so is wrong when there
<br>
are less dangerous ways of accomplishing the same thing.  It is only
<br>
the existence of the alternatives which makes cloning suspect.  In my
<br>
thought experiment, where there is no alternative, cloning is acceptable.
<br>
<p>This fits into the Extropian framework as I described above.  We object
<br>
to cloning because it gives birth to a child who has less potential for
<br>
a satisfying life, less potential extropy, than a child who is born
<br>
via other reproductive mechanisms.  But if there is no alternative,
<br>
then giving birth by cloning is the choice that maximizes extropy.
<br>
<p>This line of reasoning leads to the same result I suggested before,
<br>
that if cloning allows for the birth of additional &quot;net&quot; babies than if
<br>
this technology is not used, it actually increases the total extropy
<br>
and should be supported.  But if it does not, if the total number of
<br>
babies born would be about the same (say, because infertile parents
<br>
adopt children, which creates incentives that slightly increase birth
<br>
rates among fertile people), then cloning reduces extropy, and we as
<br>
Extropians would conclude that it is wrong.
