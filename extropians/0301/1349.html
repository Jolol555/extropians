&quot;2nd BTW, we know we have disrupted their strategy because they 
<br>
published it on line. They were going to use the same strategy they used 
<br>
against the Soviets. They would entice us into the countryside and use their 
<br>
superior knowledge of the terrain to conduct hit and run raids until we were 
<br>
picked apart. They did go into the countryside. We did follow them. Then 
<br>
things seemed to go awry. They seem to be doing a lot more running than 
<br>
hitting, raiding or picking us apart.

<br>
<p>I wonder if this was because unlike against the Soviets, these Afghani forces 
<br>
lacked the billions of dollars in support that the Mujahadeen received from 
<br>
the United States, China, and Israel? Naaaaaaaah. Couldn't be. The US just 
<br>
got lucky. It must have been a fluke! Well, we know that intervention in Iraq 
<br>
will certainly lead to mass casualties for our troops, just like it did in 
<br>
the Gulf War...Oh wait...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Of course, the Taliban was supposed to inflict mass casualties and humiliate 
<br>
the US, as had occurred when the Soviets attempted to conquer that nation and 
<br>
when the US intervened in Vietnam. And we all know that the &quot;heroic&quot; North 
<br>
Vietnamese Communists &quot;defeated&quot; the United States all by their lonesomeâ€¦:)
<br>
<p>Your favorite devout anti-Communist,
