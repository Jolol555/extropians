For IMMEDIATE Release --- Jan 21, 2003
<br>
<p>Washington, DC -- Lorrey News Network
<br>
<p>Anti-nuclear groups, not satisfied with protesting NASA's further
<br>
development of nuclear power systems for spacecraft, dubbed Project
<br>
Prometheus, is living up to their principles. The Global Network
<br>
Against Weapons &amp; Nuclear Power in Space, based in Gainesville,
<br>
Florida, has been particularly vocal in this regard. 
<br>
<p>They have thereby filed a petition in federal court for a Writ of
<br>
Mandamus to compel the US government to &quot;get all nukes out of space&quot;.
<br>
To comply with this demand, the US Government will be compelled to
<br>
engage in a multi-billion dollar crash program to develop technology
<br>
for turning off the fusion reaction occuring within the Sun.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is only just that the US Government be forced to live up to the
<br>
international treaties it has signed, including the Nuclear Test Ban
<br>
Treaty, which bans the existence of fusion explosions in space,&quot; stated
<br>
Mary Juanahead, spokeswomyn for the GNAWNPS.
<br>
<p>Reaction at NASA was officially muted. Hiding smirks and snickers, NASA
<br>
administrator O'Keefe stated, &quot;It is entirely outside the legal
<br>
jurisdiction of any earthbound authority to entail such an order.&quot;
<br>
<p>Juanahead replied to this statement by saying,&quot;This is the typical
<br>
government bureaucratic obfuscation we always see. 'No legal authority'
<br>
type fascism which we intend to combat at every turn. The people of
<br>
Mother Earth have a right to be free of the constant exposure to solar
<br>
radiation and the threat of skin cancer, sunburns, and the risk of
<br>
solar novas or other extreme flare activity, which could end life on
<br>
Earth.&quot;
<br>
<p>Reaction on the streets of Earth was decidely in favor of the anti-nuke
<br>
side. Osama Assad bin Hussein, a resident of Cairo, stated, &quot;It is our
<br>
right as righteous muslims to live in darkness and ignorance, free of
<br>
the light of day which the evil Satan United States permits to shine
<br>
down upon us. The zionist US and it's evil lapdog Israel will pay for
<br>
it's arrogance one way or the other, but it is good that there are some
<br>
Americans who understand their place in the world and intend to bring
<br>
their government to task for its evil policies.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Beijing, Yu Hu agreed, &quot;The evil running dog capitalist US must be
<br>
forced to turn off the sun, which it uses to illuminate our land,
<br>
allowing it's spy satellites and spy planes to look down upon us.&quot;
<br>
<p>Back in the US, there are supporters from unexpected quarters. Rocker
<br>
and self confessed Prince of Darkness Ozzie Osbourne seems to agree
<br>
with the anti-sun faction. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Mumble mumble, I'm the bleepin' bloody Prince of F-ckin' Darkness fer
<br>
Christ Sakes, of course I'm for turning off the sun. mumble Why do you
<br>
think I have to wear these sun glasses all the time, even indoors? 
<br>
mumble mumble Where do you think Sharon got her f-ckin' cancer from, ya
<br>
bloody git? It came from f-ckin' solar radiation, mumble mumble
<br>
mumble...,&quot; The aging rocker was quoted saying on a recent episode of
<br>
his show.
<br>
<p>In Washington, it seems the anti-nuke groups were picking up key
<br>
Democratic support. Former Senate Majority Leader and current Prime DC
<br>
Whiner Tom Daschle said,&quot;It is simply abominable that the current
<br>
administration thinks that it can get away with such a disgusting
<br>
resistance against the will of the people. The people have spoken, and
<br>
they prefer darkness to light by a two to one margin.&quot;
