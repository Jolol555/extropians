</em><br>
<p>Charles, I have initiated an entire thread &quot;oil economics&quot;
<br>
in an attempt to overcome my ignorance of how all this works.
<br>
It's certainly not my honesty that is a problem here, if
<br>
there is a problem here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US govt. is attempting to place monopolistic control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil under its control.   Some say that it's the oil companies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that the govt. is merely a front.  Plausible.  But whoever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is doing this, they aren't planning to make the rewards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to all.
</em><br>
<p>How do you know all this?  It's true that I'm discussing in
<br>
the aforementioned thread the existence of &quot;windfall profits&quot;,
<br>
and it does stand to reason that profits from Iraq's oil
<br>
could start going to the people of Iraq when Saddam falls.
<br>
But you seem to imply that such profits would go to the U.S.
<br>
or somewhere?  I thought that I read somewhere that the Western
<br>
allies have announced plans where the profits will go while
<br>
they're occupying the country.  Sorry if I've missed your
<br>
main point---I'll attend to it now:
<br>
<p>True, Iraq does have the largest known reserves.  But you
<br>
have pointed out to me that *perhaps* I was wrong to speak
<br>
of &quot;monopolistic control&quot;.  Does Iraq presently have anything
<br>
like that?  Economics:  the more oil that is produced, the
<br>
lower its price, and right now some countries like Saudi
<br>
Arabia are artificially restricting production.  (And, I
<br>
gather, with the sanctions in place, Iraq is selling relatively
<br>
little oil.)
<br>
<p>Why do you suppose that it would be &quot;the U.S.&quot; instead of
<br>
&quot;the U.S. and its allies&quot; that would be in control?  Moreover,
<br>
all that I know that they can do with the oil is sell it.
<br>
Are you supposing that they could also use such control as
<br>
a weapon?  Wouldn't the use of such a weapon simply make
<br>
stronger those that it would be used against, e.g. Russia
<br>
or Saudi Arabia?
<br>
