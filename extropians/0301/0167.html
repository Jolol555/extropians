<p>
Hal Finney presents an argument that might be read as suggesting
<br>
that since the total number of humans born will be approximately
<br>
constant anyway, cloning should be forbidden in order to stimulate
<br>
adoption, and to increase the incentive of fertile people to have
<br>
children.
<br>
<p>It is not at all clear that the freedom of an individual to
<br>
seek to obtain a clone should be abrogated for any reason,
<br>
least of all a statistically flawed one.  It can by no means
<br>
be calculated that fertile couples will have more children in
<br>
order to offer them up for adoption, nor that people desiring
<br>
children of their own genetic makeup will freely accept a
<br>
substitute.  As is so often the case, global utilitarian
<br>
theories fail to match the benefits that obtain when people
<br>
are free to choose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe it's not necessary to explore those esoteric notions of identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to make my point.  Try looking at the cloning issue from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of view of maximizing extropy.  We want there to be the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of people with the greatest potential for growing and changing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving themselves.  Whether cloning advances extropy or not depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the specifics.
</em><br>
<p>That is certainly reasonable and correct.  It is also quite
<br>
controversial, and I commend your boldness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I am right..., it suggests to me that we aren't really worried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about birth defects and issues of consent per se; but rather, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object to cloning precisely because there is an alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not that giving birth in a manner which is dangerous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child is wrong in itself, but that doing so is wrong when there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are less dangerous ways of accomplishing the same thing.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, an individual wishing to bring a child into existence
<br>
perhaps should explore the possibility using &quot;natural&quot; means,
<br>
even up to the point, if we had freedom, of paying someone else
<br>
to conceive and bear a child.  But whose choice should this be?
<br>
Should this choice be decided at the global level, and laws
<br>
written to force individuals to forego cloning or contracting
<br>
others?
<br>
<p>I think that the answer is obviously &quot;no&quot;.  The urge to legislate
<br>
choices of this nature springs from an unhealthy desire on people's
<br>
part to dictate their own moral tastes to others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This fits into the Extropian framework as I described above.  We object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cloning because it gives birth to a child who has less potential for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a satisfying life, less potential extropy, than a child who is born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via other reproductive mechanisms.  But if there is no alternative,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then giving birth by cloning is the choice that maximizes extropy.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is correct.  Only you have left unsaid who it is who
<br>
will be allowed to determine whether this alternative exists.
<br>
The important question is, as it is so frequently, &quot;who decides?&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This line of reasoning leads to the same result I suggested before,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if cloning allows for the birth of additional &quot;net&quot; babies than if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this technology is not used, it actually increases the total extropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and should be supported.  But if it does not, if the total number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; babies born would be about the same (say, because infertile parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopt children, which creates incentives that slightly increase birth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rates among fertile people), then cloning reduces extropy, and we as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians would conclude that it is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I cannot argue one bit with your logic.  Thanks for the clear analysis.
<br>
