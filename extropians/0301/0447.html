<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but in fairness to the anti-abortionists, it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be noted that this example is hypothetical. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't ever remembering seeing any of them use this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wording, and therefore reveal themselves as suffering this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, but *this one* comes from the leader of government business in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lower house. Tony Abbott MP. Looks pretty similar to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I believe (sic) that life (sic) begins at conception. I believe that any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other points we might choose are essentially arbitrary and uncertain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I believe that this is a view founded not in religion, not in faith,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but on the logic of the matter. ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Let me make this very clear: even if destroying embryos to harvest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their stem cells could create the medical miracles, which are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so commonly claimed, I would be against it, because there are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that we cannot do, no matter how good the cause.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But wouldn't it have meant exactly the same thing if
<br>
he had said, &quot;My working hypothesis is that human existence
<br>
begins at conception, and I contend that this is a view 
<br>
founded not in religion, not in faith, but on logic.&quot;
<br>
<p>and had gone on to say
<br>
<p>&quot;I am against snuffing out human existence in principle.&quot;
<br>
<p>It seems to me that he would be saying exactly the same
<br>
thing, no?
<br>
<p>It think that we have an *ontological* dispute in
<br>
that he considers human beings to be absent/present
<br>
over tiny changes in the physical situation, and tiny
<br>
changes in t.  I have derided this for years as &quot;lack
<br>
of philosophical continuity&quot;, i.e., when one's values
<br>
jump suddenly over tiny domains of physical changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They start from a position of faith or belief assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that as an axiom and reason from there.
</em><br>
<p>But I know people &quot;on our side&quot; who start from the
<br>
axiom &quot;suffering is bad&quot; (that's me!) and &quot;the wishes
<br>
of sentients are not to be denied&quot; (that's Rafal).
<br>
<p>(Eternal Truth No. 2 &quot;Every sentence must be further
<br>
modified&quot; naturally applying to both these phrases.)
<br>
<p>Now yes, in general, I'm with you and I *do* have a
<br>
problem with axiomatic schemes.  I think that they stem
<br>
from math-envy.  The people who engage in this needed
<br>
to have gone through inoculation at the hands of
<br>
the Randians or the Scientologists to get that
<br>
out of their heads.
