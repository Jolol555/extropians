Ho ho. However--
<br>
<p>I have to report, Mike, that I beat you to this prank, in STRIPED HOLES
<br>
(1988), which I hope will be on Fictionwise.com in a few weeks' time:
<br>
<p>=======
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I represent a political faction in the forty-seventh century,&quot; the insect
<br>
told him complacently. &quot;Out of office right now, true, but we're making our
<br>
comeback. Plenty of support out there in the hustings. Ordinary people
<br>
aren't going to sit still much longer for-&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Political...&quot; Sopwith muttered. His mind had seized on the first word he
<br>
could relate to and rejected the rest. &quot;Why me? Why not the Prime Minister?
<br>
Industrialists, the guys with the real power? Anyway, why Australia, for
<br>
God's sake? I'd expect you to be sitting in the White House or the
<br>
Bundestag, what the hell are you-&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insect snorted tersely. It gazed at the ceiling. &quot;If you were as astute
<br>
as my colleagues must have supposed, you'd grasp the reasoning instantly.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sopwith's jaw sagged. For a moment one could be forgiven for thinking he
<br>
was about to burst into tears.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I haven't the time to second-guess their judgments,&quot; the alien said
<br>
huffily. &quot;The line of thought is obvious. Think, man. The human creatures
<br>
you itemized are well past their prime as breeders.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's not what I hear,&quot; Sopwith mumbled.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not interested in discussing their dirty little hotel room secrets,&quot;
<br>
the insect said haughtily. &quot;We're talking species survival here, not
<br>
hide-the-cabana. Your world is due to crash into long-term deep freeze in a
<br>
matter of hours and you want to trade backroom scuttlebutt with me. Joseph
<br>
Smith!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sopwith leaped to his feet. &quot;The war of the worlds?&quot; he shouted. &quot;Invasion!
<br>
You're planning to destroy the Earth!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sit down you bloody fool.&quot; The insect drew from its breast pocket a thin
<br>
cigar and shot him in the middle of the forehead with an intense thread of
<br>
hard green light. He collapsed voicelessly back into his wonderfully
<br>
comfortable leather seat.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pay heed. I'll tell you this just once. Your sun's setting is about to be
<br>
turned down by my political opponents in the Solar Energy Conservation
<br>
Party. They'll leave the pilot light running, but your oceans will certainly
<br>
ice up and most of the atmosphere will fall down within two weeks.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why?&quot; Sopwith cried feebly. &quot;Why would anyone in the future do such a
<br>
terrible thing to their ancestors?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not that hard to appreciate, I would have thought, even if they are
<br>
my political enemies. What have you ever done for your descendants? Ripped
<br>
them off, that's all. Used up their reserves. Pillaged the planet. Turned
<br>
the nonrenewable resources into flat-screen word processors and Dolly Parton
<br>
DVDs. They're pulling the plug, Mr. Hammil, and though I can't condone them,
<br>
I respect their right to their opinions.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't understand! Why the sun? Why not- I don't know, why not take all
<br>
the uranium away or something? Aren't they against the misuse of nuclear
<br>
energy?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course they are! What do you think the Sun is, you cretin? A
<br>
thermonuclear reactor. It's burning up nearly five million tonnes of gas a
<br>
second. Do you have any appreciation of what sort of fuel bill that amounts
<br>
to? We're talking 3.86 by 10 to the 33 ergs every second. That's not chicken
<br>
feed. That's sheer waste, from the forty-seventh century viewpoint. Why
<br>
should you low barely evolved human creatures get it all? Answer me that!&quot;
<br>
<p>=======
<br>
<p>and so on.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick
