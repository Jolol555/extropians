<p>&lt;&lt;Yes, Samantha, but did you happen to read for content?  Or far better did
<br>
you
<br>
happen to read the email that did a wonderful job of explaining this issue?
<br>
Alternatively did you just grab a phrase you could make something out of and
<br>
blast off for outer space.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I tend to disagree with Samantha much of the time. It is a
<br>
measure of our present moral calamity that I find myself
<br>
agreeing with her. Make of that what you will....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; Then you toss this in &quot;What is this &quot;we&quot;?  You will sit this one
<br>
out
<br>
due to age and cheer other &quot;boys&quot; on to their death in a more senseless
<br>
conflict than even Vietnam was.  Bully for you.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;As to your remarks about sitting the war out.  I am a hawk.  I do
<br>
have
<br>
a DD214 as requested yesterday.  But you have no idea what ever what goes
<br>
through the mind of a silver haired hawk.  You know only to grab a handy
<br>
slogan that you can shout in front of your private Amen chorus.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fascinating. You claim to have served yet the thought of a young
<br>
and (perhaps foolish) Marine who will never walk again does not
<br>
seem so very horrific to you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask you a question Mr. &quot;Hawk&quot;, when my Marines begin to
<br>
die for your pride of homeland, and when they choke on the desert
<br>
sand and are cut down by bombs and shells from &quot;friendly fire&quot;
<br>
then where will your grand sarcasm and eagerness to attack the
<br>
&quot;enemy peacenik&quot; be?  When the pipes and gantries in the great
<br>
ships break under battle conditions and some poor snipe loses
<br>
functional use of an arm because it's GQ and not sick-call
<br>
where is your battle-lust?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; Let me ask you a question?  Those of us that are hawks on this
<br>
list,
<br>
who do you suppose we value the most, you or a young hawk that might in
<br>
theory have to ship overseas someday?  You are right.  Most of us consider
<br>
that young hawk, male or female, to be far more valuable than you.  Not only
<br>
that we consider it our duty to be sure you don't waste those young hawks.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Think not of the &quot;young hawks&quot; for I can think of few who appreciate
<br>
your too casual attitude towards their quick death (if they are lucky) or
<br>
a lingering hated life while they shit and piss themselves in a VA hospital
<br>
bed they will NEVER leave. Do you know what a &quot;goner ward&quot; smells
<br>
like Mr. Hawk?  Do you know what happens to a young Marine
<br>
or sailor, full of life, when they are unable to run or even work without
<br>
intractable pain? I think you should quit arguing with Samantha and
<br>
meditate on the ineffable loss to us this conflict may bring. Contemplate
<br>
the human tragedy that may await us, because even in a volunteer
<br>
force &quot;selective objectors&quot; have no recourse but to bear arms and
<br>
die if neccessary.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't even mention the Iraqi casualties (civilians and conscripts , not
<br>
elite volunteers or powermongers). It's hard to get a silver-haired hawk
<br>
to give one good goddamn about some poor 17 year old who's Dad is
<br>
a Wahabbi scum raghead (Thanks to Spudboy for the image!) who
<br>
naturally deserves a guest of honor seat with an Apache's DZ?
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;might in theory have to ship out&quot;? The bases in Norfolk are half empty.
<br>
I only hope the hospitals will not house their remainders.
<br>
&lt;&lt;You and Johnson sent the hawks to Vietnam in 64 to win an election.  You
<br>
cheered and voted, Johnson won and handcuffed the men doing the fighting,
<br>
then when they returned home you spat on those young men and women -- they
<br>
had only gone there because you drafted them.
<br>
Ron h&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you think we should send them in again?
<br>
&nbsp;I think you should utilize that DD214 of yours and save some trees from
<br>
being
<br>
latrine tissue.
<br>
<p><p>I cannot imagine the arrogance which would lead anyone of any morality
<br>
or decency to condone this war. And I am one arrogant SOB.
<br>
But perhaps I am hopelessly confused by the fact I will have to pick
<br>
up the broken pieces of some of America's most sincere (if somewhat
<br>
gungho) citizens. I may not be a devildoc proper but I am a corpsman,
<br>
and an NCO, and I find Samantha's attitudes far more palatable than
<br>
anyone (outside of the Army units or the MARDIV) who takes the
<br>
&quot;glass parking lot&quot; attitude to Bagdad. (metaphor warning!!)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's it.. if I had 20 years to reminisce about this experience and no
<br>
possibility of facing fire myself .. maybe I'd be ready to chill with a six
<br>
pack
<br>
and watch the smart bombs impact on CNN. And chat about realpolitik
<br>
on email lists.
<br>
