<p>Yes. And then it becomes a matter of where to place your money. On 20 
<br>
extremely expensive children or 2000 potential children? Unless you 
<br>
have good evidence that the clone/super upbringing is at least a 100 
<br>
times as good as the support for the potential Einsteins, then it is 
<br>
not cost efficient. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with with your math at this point.  This shows how rare the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say that the probability that the genius will exceed the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Evidence, please.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that we can not anticipate what these individuals would
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; With an education that emphasized technology and sciences though
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Note that you are implicitely assuming that it is technology and 
<br>
science that is the important areas. How do you know it? If you 
<br>
accept your own reasoning, then what the super-kids would select 
<br>
would likely be a better choice, since they are smart enough to see 
<br>
it, right? On the other hand, maybe they aren't automatically 
<br>
infallible helpers of humanity and might need guidance. But then they 
<br>
start to seem like well-educated and gifted people again, and their 
<br>
potential for saviourship seems less impressive.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; You have never heard of Kantian ethics, have you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While ethics are all well and good.  They don't do a lot for us if every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; madman on the block can engineer a doomsday virus or when millions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dieing from disease and starvation.  We are not dooming the children to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miserable live on the contrary they will have the best life has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offer.  If this violates some tenet of transhumanism but helps our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet to survive, I will gladly accept that transgression.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, this is starting to sound like some of the other threads on this
<br>
list. &quot;Democracy, peace and freedom are threatened! Let's coerce,
<br>
surveil and bomb to save them! The good ends justify the means!&quot; ;-) 
<br>
<p>Besides, ethics isn't just some garnishing on top of your
<br>
rationalisations. It is about what you believe in and will do to
<br>
achieve it. Your above argument sounds suspiciously utilitarian to
<br>
me, and you should be careful where that road leads when applied to
<br>
the creation of humans or the fate of the world (after all,
<br>
*anything* is better than the end of the world, isn't it? so you can
<br>
do *anything* in good conscience to prevent it). 
<br>
<p>Sure, cloning kids and trying to raise them to become geniuses is not
<br>
something I consider evil, just misguided, from my own
<br>
libertarian-humanist neo-aristotelian standpoint. But I'm worried
<br>
about the lack of ethical reasoning among transhumanists, since it
<br>
makes the movement enormously vulnerable to an ethical attack. 
<br>
Witness how genetic modification has been made unethical in public
<br>
perception - it is the result of a lack of ethical understanding 
<br>
among its defenders. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The myth of the lone genius as the necessary and sufficient condition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; progress is popular. But it isn't very true, and policies based on it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; can waste much effort and resources on infinitesimal gains. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can you place a price on five Einsteins or five Teslas?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of math, computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, biotech, and physics it will take to solve the worlds most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressing problems disease,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap energy, and protecting ourselves from terrorists may be beyond our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability without them.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, you probably could place a price on them. Take the total 
<br>
amount of wealth made possible through them over time, and compare it 
<br>
to what amount of money would generate the same wealth if invested. 
<br>
You would get some huge but finite numbers (some trickery with 
<br>
discounting of the future may be needed).
<br>
<p>Here is another common error: to claim that something is so valuable 
<br>
that any price is worth it (e.g. the saving the world example above). 
<br>
A new Einstein would be worth a lot, but would she be worth (say) 
<br>
halving the standards of living worldwide? Probably not. The value of 
<br>
such a genius would also depend on who you asked; one could imagine 
<br>
an investment project that invested money in creating the next 
<br>
Einstein. That way individual investors could invest as much as they 
<br>
think it would be worth to them to have an Einstein around.
<br>
<p>But my core argument above is simply that Einsteins are not the key 
<br>
to progress. If you look at the history of science it is fairly clear 
<br>
that somebody would have found relativity in the early 20th century, 
<br>
the pieces were all there and Lorentz, Poincare, Hilbert and many 
<br>
others were working on them. The same goes for the photoelectric 
<br>
effect and Brownian motion; the step to quantum mechanics required a 
<br>
leap of faith but it was already felt by many parallel and less 
<br>
talented researchers. That Einstein managed to bag these three, and 
<br>
then went on to generalize SR to GR in a highly creative way, shows 
<br>
his genius. But without him we would likely have talked about 
<br>
Grossbauer's Theory of Relativity instead. 
<br>
<p>The same goes for many other breakthroughs. Darwin discovered 
<br>
evolution in parallel with Wallace, the application of electricity 
<br>
were greatly speeded by Edison's management and marketing genius but 
<br>
similar ideas were floating around at the time. Without Pasteur 
<br>
medicine might have been delayed decades in figuring out the 
<br>
bacterial origin of infection, but it would have happened. None of 
<br>
these geniuses were *necessary* for their discoveries. And once made, 
<br>
they were still rather useless until a lot of second violinists took 
<br>
them up and made all the important but unglamorous work of applying, 
<br>
extending and marketing them. 
<br>
<p>I have noted that this view of the importance of genius is not 
<br>
particularly popular on this list, since we tend to value 
<br>
intelligence over almost everything else. But that is just the same 
<br>
kind of intellectual's fallacy as Hayek criticises when it comes to 
<br>
central planning (intellectuals often like to think that they could 
<br>
plan things better than those markets and laypeople). Genius is good, 
<br>
but it isn't the motor of history. The motor of history is the far 
<br>
more prosaic but powerful striving of billions of people towards a 
<br>
better life for themselves as they see it. It is not neat, it is 
<br>
slow, but it has a massive parallelism and robustness geniuses do not 
<br>
have.
