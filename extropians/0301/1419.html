<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw Jef Allbright raise the possibility of complementing the mailing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list with a wiki.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw some folk ask about wikis and a few agree that it was a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea.
</em><br>
<p>I'll add my vote for it being a good idea.
<br>
<p>I also liked the following comment:
<br>
<p>---&gt;Gary Miller
<br>
<em>&gt; Robert J. Bradbury said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;So how do I set up my extropic priorities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  Aging, malnutrition/starvation (perhaps poverty), AIDS, Malaria,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  perhaps murderous tyrants, ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This would be something great to have in a Wiki.  All of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participents extropic priorities and how they are choosing to persue and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act upon them in the coming year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This not only gives newcomers an illustration as to what's important to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other Extropians but it gives them an idea on how to apply Extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles in their lives!
</em><br>
<p>But maybe that's just me being egocentric. I do think it's a good idea to
<br>
present some sort of &quot;things you can do&quot; guidelines for people who would
<br>
like to do stuff but aren't in the cut out and do themselves mould.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I saw one person question whether it was the right tool for the job and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that Jef answered well that good question by saying it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complement not substitute the existing ExI list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw Lee Daniel Crocker say he had some expertise and could set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a wiki and he offered too if there was sufficient support for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have heard a few people support it, no one directly oppose it, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what stands out in my mind are two questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Are there any practical and logistical problems that the ExI Board or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any one else is aware of that would stop a wiki being implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a complementary fashion to the ExI list as Jef suggested?
</em><br>
<p>It would also be a good idea to get official sanctioning, blessing and a
<br>
subdomain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) How much will it cost to set up and maintain? If  Lee Daniel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crocker is willing to contribute some of his time and expertise that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great. But I don't think he should have to bear all the burden for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something I'd certainly like to see and at least a few others seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested at least interested in as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If someone (maybe Lee? who might know what's involved) could put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together a rough costed plan AND there are no substantial reasons for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposing the proposal then my third question would become where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do I send money to help cover the costs?
</em><br>
<p>Money costs and setup costs are minimal; people and time costs are less so.
<br>
The best thing people can contribute is their time when the basic software
<br>
is set up.
<br>
<p>Software is freely available:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=wiki&amp;section=projects">http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=wiki&amp;section=projects</a><br>
<p>(The above link is worth visiting just to see the phrase &quot;A wiki
<br>
implementation in Emacs.&quot;)
<br>
<p>If you pick something simple that doesn't require root access or complicated
<br>
appservers, such as PHP:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=wiki&amp;orderby=&amp;filter=183">http://freshmeat.net/search/?q=wiki&amp;orderby=&amp;filter=183</a>8‹<br>
<p>(This link is worth looking at to see that it doesn't take long to run out
<br>
of names that sound like &quot;wikki&quot; but are still original).
<br>
<p>then you can grab a nice host (www.javaservlethosting.com -- responsive,
<br>
cheap, reliable) for ~$20/month, unzip the software, set up the database and
<br>
off you go. (This is the work of an evening, if that). Then its &quot;just&quot;
<br>
cajoling people to join in and participate. It helps to have a single
<br>
fanatic or webmaster pushing it all along.
<br>
<p>Now on the community side of things, why restrict it just to ExI? Why not
<br>
make it more inclusive and drag in the WTA/Cryonics/Life Extension/etc folks
<br>
as well by invitation? There's significant topic overlap, and I'm all for
<br>
them hearing more about ExI opinionations.
<br>
<p>There's also traffic driving to think about -- no one uses it if no-one
<br>
knows about it. Such things as adding prominent links to the relevant home
<br>
pages (such as ExI and the ExI BBS), maybe coughing up $1/day for google
<br>
ads, appending the URL to the footer of ExI list posts, thinking about rules
<br>
for replicating traffic or updates to other forums (ExI BBS, the list), etc,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>For a successful small community Wiki implementation, have a look at:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.infoanarchy.org/">http://www.infoanarchy.org/</a>
<br>
<p>(Wiki links on the right hand side of the main page). I'm pretty sure those
<br>
guys get about the same amount of traffic as, say, Nanodot does, going from
<br>
posting frequency. Their Wiki has been around for 6 months, give or take.
