<em>&gt;&gt; ### Most people with severe deformities resent their disability (a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; assume that she will develop the common attitude, rather than her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mother's idiosyncratic distaste for limbs.  Therefore, the Golden
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Rule (in the form of veil of ignorance) demands that we act in the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, I balk when I read phrases like &quot;Golden rule demands&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;we act&quot;, and &quot;predicted interest&quot;.  Surely you feel some unease
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>### No, why?
<br>
<p>When we see a passers-by being assailed with a knife, we predict this might
<br>
result in bodily harm to her, and since we would not like to be bodily
<br>
harmed ourselves, the Golden Rule demands that we act in the predicted
<br>
interest of that person. I hope you wouldn't indifferently wait and see her
<br>
die, rather than call the police, would you?

<p><em>&gt; To wax satirical for a moment, I can just see you &quot;acting&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;save the children&quot; of religious non-conformists who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want their children enhanced with the latest gadgetry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or genes.
</em><br>
<p>### Only if failure to enhance would result in significant, irreversible
<br>
loss of freedom, suffering, and risk of unwanted death. Same as cutting off
<br>
limbs, or not treating a bleed with a transfusion.
