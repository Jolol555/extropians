</em><br>
<p>Very true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When the balance of power shifts drastically, expect that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; social contract will be re-written by the party with a new and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more dominant role.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I hope you are wrong, because times are a changin'.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; For centuries this was true.  Then one day along came a group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men that threw out the local ruler.  These men felt that their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights were from nature and nature's God.  These rights were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possession of the individual and were not received from the state.
</em><br>
<p>The meme &quot;rights of Englishmen&quot; was already in common use,
<br>
and it strongly affected the kind of society that they 
<br>
wished to set up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact they felt they had to have a government but that at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time government was the greatest threat to their safety and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare.  So they formed a new government under a constitution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and decided what powers they wished the central government to have.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To maintain ultimate power over the society in their own hands they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrote into the constitution certain guarantees of their power --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among these are the right to speak freely and the right to bear arms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        And so this &quot;social contract&quot; has lasted far longer than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing &quot;social contracts&quot; of the day.
</em><br>
<p>Also to receive a great deal of the credit was the basic
<br>
culture of the American colonies, puritan work-ethic and
<br>
so on.
<br>
<p>What I want to know is whether you are correct in your
<br>
inferences about
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These men felt that their rights were from nature and nature's God.
</em><br>
<p>Was that a psychological necessity for them?  If instead they
<br>
had abandoned belief in natural rights and a Divine Approval,
<br>
would they have been able to pull it off?  (You see, I believe
<br>
natural rights to be fictitious entities, and suppose instead
<br>
that only legal rights actually exist, and that these exist
<br>
only in a social contract---as Charles was saying.)
