<em>&gt; When, and only when, it rises to action can one morally act,

</em><br>
<p>No. These are *at least* different classes of &quot;counterproductive
<br>
idiotic authoritarian nonsense&quot;.
<br>
<p>To speak is an act. To defame is an act. It seems LDC is arguing
<br>
that one can only respond in kind - i.e.. speech for speech. More
<br>
serious action for more serious action. This is mistaken. Some speech
<br>
is extremely serious and some is trivial as are other types of action.
<br>
To forbear action until the end of the speech &quot;ready, aim, fire!&quot;, for
<br>
instance, may be to much forbearance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no doubt that lies can lead  to behaviors, and I'll even concede that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's one entity--the government itself--whose speech /should/ be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; free speech is a fundamental human right, because governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have human rights.
</em><br>
<p>I agree governments don't have human rights. Whether governments
<br>
as opposed to people within governments speak is an interesting point.
<br>
<p>Certainly, governments, like corporations, can be held responsible at
<br>
law for what some of their &quot;agents&quot; do in their capacity as &quot;agents&quot;. So
<br>
in a way they could be said to speak. But I think this is misleading too.
<br>
&quot;Governmental accountability&quot; endures beyond that of individual agents
<br>
-in-government passing on - but I don't see that as governments
<br>
speaking.
<br>
<p>I think free speech is something to be taken very seriously but what
<br>
could it mean to say it is a *fundamental* *human right*. Not only
<br>
begged is the question of where such rights arise if not in law, the
<br>
very law, that may include defamation law.
<br>
<p>And separately what is fundamental. Can fundamentals be in conflict
<br>
ever, and if so which fundamental prevails and how do we decide?
<br>
<p>To use the old chestnut would you LDC actually go so far as to
<br>
argue a person should have the right to yell &quot;fire!&quot; in a crowded theatre?
<br>
And if not, what's fundamental actually mean as it appears not to mean
<br>
absolute or inalienable?
<br>
<p>(I know such an action is not defamation but your contention of
<br>
*fundamental* *human rights*  is something you introduced and it
<br>
seems it could be worth being clear about what *fundamental* means
<br>
in this sense.)
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<p>- [LDC]
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that's exactly what I'm accusing you of--wanting to suppress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false speech about yourself with force, rather than with competition.
</em><br>
<p>Whoa! On several counts.
<br>
<p>(1) Defamation law can only be applied *afterward*. A particular
<br>
defamatory statement is not suppressed by a particular defamatory
<br>
action at law, the damage of it is rather acknowledged and mitigated
<br>
to the extent mitigation is possible and in a proportionate way.
<br>
<p>(2) Sure the existence of the defamation laws acts as some disincentive
<br>
to general defamatory statements being uttered (but this is in
<br>
accordance with the wishes of society or the defamation laws would
<br>
not be there long). Surely when a society, a group of voters, through
<br>
their representatives decides to enact laws to enshrine rights including
<br>
the right to be compensated for defamation by the person doing the
<br>
defaming this is not a crude exercise in brute force. If this is brute force
<br>
then every restriction on any 'action' or 'freedom' any individual imagines
<br>
they have is not just brute force in the mind of the particular aggrieved
<br>
individual but is brute force for all. Well, perhaps ultimately, such *is*
<br>
force, but if it is force, it is a far gentler and more proportionate use of
<br>
force than having every man, woman and child have to defend themselves
<br>
against defamatory acts constantly by counter personal actions (with all
<br>
the inefficiency and wasted effort that implies). Defamation laws, like
<br>
murder laws are forces applied generally to restrict the anti-social (and
<br>
defamation is anti-social - as society has determined and rendered into
<br>
law) from applying greater force more often and more specifically.
<br>
<p>So yes law is about &quot;force&quot; of a sort, but its about the use of lesser force
<br>
than otherwise would be required be exerted by each person acting
<br>
alone to protect themselves and their reputations.
<br>
<p>To oppose such 'force' seems akin to opposing mutual agreements
<br>
between people to come to each others aid. That's like opposing the
<br>
force a person uses in defending themself against greater force.
<br>
<p>The notion of law *merely* as &quot;force&quot; seems too simplistic.
<br>
<p>(3) If competition, in its most extreme forms, is not checked, predation
<br>
arises. Competition, unchecked, not only arises within an arena, it spills
<br>
out of it and you have &quot;jungle law&quot;. The law acts like Hobbes notion of
<br>
the Leviathan, it helps keep competition *within* the arena more of the
<br>
time than it would if the law wasn't there.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We don't live in an ideal, rational world. People do judge by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rumors and reputation, which is almost never true, objective or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  rational. You, for example, judge me -whatwasit- to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;left-wing&quot;, &quot;anti-american&quot;, &quot;naive&quot;, etc. without any knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about me but the few words I've  written here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
- [LDC]
<br>
<em>&gt; That's true too, and you are free to call me on it, and I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are others here and elsewhere who disagree.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  You can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be harmed by my evaluation of you in the minds of those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already give me more credibility, in which case the harm is already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done anyway.
</em><br>
<p>This is not so. No third party has to consider an allegation as either
<br>
*entirely* true or *entirely* false based on determining who of two
<br>
parties has more credibility. If I was going to get a service from A
<br>
and heard B carrying on about getting poor service from A I don't
<br>
have to conclude B is necessarily lying to decide on the information
<br>
I have I am not better off seeking the same service from C.  Indeed
<br>
I may seek the same service from C out of what seems to me to be
<br>
an abundance of caution. I might *never* learn that C put B up to
<br>
do a smear campaign on A. I act on imperfect information by making
<br>
probabilistic judgements.  Without defamation laws B might make
<br>
a career out of selling his smearing services to competitors. Society
<br>
recognizing such a possibility is prudent to put in place deterrents
<br>
to it. I don't have to esteme B highly for B's statements about A to
<br>
cause me to have doubts about A.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Likewise, you can only damage my reputation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among those who prefer to believe you,
</em><br>
<p>Not so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and I am generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconcerned about how I am perceived by them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Generally unconcerned? Does that imply some special or particular
<br>
concerns? &quot;Generally&quot; seems to leave quite a big loophole given free
<br>
speech is being argued to be a *fundamental* human right.
<br>
<p>- - [KB]
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Example: &quot;Lee Daniel Crocker is a child molester. Protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your kids, force him out of this town&quot;. What would your defence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be? Ask for evidences? Have you ever seen a witch-hunt?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Remember McCarthy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
- [LDC]
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes, we remember McCarthy well.  What we learned was to
</em><br>
<p>We? Possibly different people learnt different things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; not to hang witch-hunters instead of witches--what we learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to recognize with-hunts for what they are and better use our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own judgment.
</em><br>
<p>So long as &quot;we&quot;, a collective is getting together to do some learning
<br>
why shouldn't &quot;we&quot; the same collective, go the next step, pool some
<br>
resources  and make a set of mutual promises and alliances. A sort
<br>
of set of laws. And if &quot;we&quot; prefers the benefits of a little general
<br>
purpose prevention and specifically directed punishment on offenders
<br>
-against-the-social-good (defamers) then why shouldn't &quot;we&quot; be
<br>
allowed to so decide? Seems in various jurisdictions on the matter
<br>
of defamation &quot;we&quot; have, &quot;we&quot; do and &quot;we&quot; can review from time
<br>
to time whether the balancing of free speech and defamation laws
<br>
has been optimally struck.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It  wasn't new laws that took down McCarthy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was good reporting by men of integrity and courage like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Edward R. Murrow.
</em><br>
<p>I am glad free speech still has such ardent advocates. But to cherish
<br>
every cheap shot as free speech seems to me to show an unnecessary
<br>
and arbitrary want of sensible discrimination. Defamation laws sensible
<br>
construed and applied can protect society from wasting its efforts. So
<br>
let's ensure they are sensibly construed and applied. Why should we
<br>
assume society (or judges and juries) are unable to discriminate between
<br>
legitimate use of free speech and mere public nuisance? With defamation
<br>
laws, the case still needs to be made that a particular &quot;speech&quot; was
<br>
defamatory before it stops being &quot;free&quot;, but even then it has not been
<br>
*suppressed*, rather the anti-social damage caused gets proportionally
<br>
mitigated. Anybody that holds that the best defence for them personally
<br>
is to speak out rather than litigate has that option. It can hardly be
<br>
optimal to leave the speechless defenceless.
