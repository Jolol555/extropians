Example-
<br>
<p>We manufacture a medical food which contains cannabis plant parts of the
<br>
non
<br>
THC type along with a number of ingredients.
<br>
Say a regulator says &quot; I don't like that guy's  or his product&quot;.  I
<br>
don't want to spend a lot of effort to keep that product off the
<br>
market... but maybe there is an easy way.
<br>
I know the guy needs a criminal record check yearly  to make his
<br>
product.
<br>
I know the permits are applied for yearly and usually never issued for a
<br>
month
<br>
past the year start.
<br>
<p><p>My brother is an RCMP near where the guy lives.
<br>
I'll get my brother to go out and check for his permit next jan02 when I
<br>
know he has yet to come in for his criminal record check and apply for
<br>
his permit.  If he can be found not to have a permit I can use that to
<br>
charge him for that as an offence thus prevent him from having a clean
<br>
record or getting his permit.  I know that all other
<br>
people like him who apply have a lag period but that does not matter.  I
<br>
will create guilt and use it to achieve another goal which is motivated
<br>
by my personal dislike of the guy.

<em>&gt;  As a

<em>&gt; &gt; selective prosecution.  What must be shown is that the particular

<em>&gt; &gt; prosecution is malicious, which is very different. Steven Harvey

<em>&gt; ### Ooops. I guess I made a mistake here. I assumed that availability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; records showing that the prosecutors habitually ignore a crime would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient to sway a jury. Let's say, if you had video recordings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of cars speeding by a police car, with only one of them being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (apparently randomly) selected for a stop - could you introduce it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defending the selected person? What if that person was minority? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of &quot;malicious prosecution&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I respond:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Mere randomness isn't objectionable.  In fact most speeders,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drug users, etc. aren't apprehended. Nor do police methods generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aim at discovering all offenders. (IMO)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         If the person was a minority, then this could form the basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a legal challenge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; {assuming that many non-minority offenders were seen but ignored.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because minority status is an impermissible basis for the exercise of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discretion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Malicious prosecution is where the State prosecutes a case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having actual knowledge of the innocence of the accused, for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ulterior motive.  (Rough definition - in my jurisdiction, at least)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Hope this is of general interest
</em><br>
