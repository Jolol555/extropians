<p>Samantha, I hear your voice.  I may not agree with your views but I do
<br>
support freedom of speech.  That some of those protesters have good
<br>
intentions is not the point I was trying to make.  The WWP folks are
<br>
professional agitators whose agenda is socialism at any price.  I keep
<br>
hearing complaints about the lack of freedoms and human rights.  The
<br>
least whiff of perceived &quot;police state&quot; actions by the DOJ is trumpeted
<br>
as signaling the downfall of the U.S. Constitution.  I don't see it.
<br>
<p>BTW, anti-war protesters in Bisbee, Arizona this weekend numbered 300.
<br>
Impressive for a population of 6,358 (1998).  Bisbee is the county seat for
<br>
Cochise County and has long since metamorphosed from a mining town to
<br>
an arts and tourism center.  The town has a fair population of aging
<br>
hippies and yuppies of various descriptions.
<br>
<p>No protesters in Sierra Vista, Arizona with a population of 38,068 (1998).
<br>
I must admit this statistic is slewed as our town is adjacent to Fort Huachuca. 
<br>
Last week an additional 400 troops from the U.S. Army 11th Signal Brigade began
<br>
deploying to classified locations.

<br>
<p>You'll be hearing a lot about antiwar protests in the next few days, but
<br>
our lazy press probably will not exert itself overmuch to tell you about
<br>
the jolly organizers. This connects some interesting dots.
<br>
<p>Hail Hydra!
