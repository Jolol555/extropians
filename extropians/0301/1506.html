<em>&gt; &gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ditto on rules of evidence as above. There is in fact evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concealment in that significant quantities of chemical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotoxins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; known to be in inventory in 1998 are not accounted for in Iraq's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recent Declaration to the Security Council. They have disappeared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the tally, and Iraq refuses to disclose what happened to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Samantha responded:
<br>
<em>&gt; Where precisely did you get this information?
</em><br>
<p>To which Mike Lorrey said:
<br>
&quot;Where millions of other informed citizens get it: cable news, the
<br>
newspapers, and the internet. Hans Blix stated these facts before the
<br>
Security Council (as did the US administration) after Iraq released its
<br>
Declaration to the UNSCOM.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha, I can not seem to find a response on your part to this
<br>
information. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq submitted to U.N. inspections in February of 1991, after the
<br>
Persian Gulf War. In doing so, they agreed to end all weapons of mass
<br>
destruction programs, however; in 1997, American members of the U.N. Special
<br>
Commision (UNSCOM) were expelled from Iraq. In 1998 Iraq temporarily
<br>
withdrew cooperation, on grounds of their complaint that the Inspection
<br>
Teams were comprised of an unfair proportion of U.S. and British members. In
<br>
December, 1998, U.N. Special Commision determined that Iraq was not fully
<br>
complying, and removed all inspectors and officials from Iraq. Iraq
<br>
continued to reject new weapon inspections programs. In September of 2002,
<br>
on threat of &quot;dire consequences&quot;, Iraq unconditionally accepted the return
<br>
of U.N. weapons inspectors. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally did some digging to turn up a more accurate list of
<br>
what UN inspectors had all ready found, but were not disclosed in IRAQ
<br>
10,000 page declaration.  Note, if WMD destruction are NOT found, that would
<br>
be a very bad thing, because it means saddam has them but has successfully
<br>
obfuscated their locations.  Every time someone on the media says 'Bush is
<br>
planning for war, even though UN inspectors have found no WMD' they should
<br>
be saying 'Bush is planning for war because the UN inspectors have not found
<br>
the WMD they had all-ready previously found in IRAQ, that now go unaccounted
<br>
for.'  No, its not an outright lie on the medias part, but this blatent
<br>
ommission of information changes the interpretation drastically.  
<br>

<p>And Also - <a href="http://www.house.gov/hunter/iraqfailures.html">http://www.house.gov/hunter/iraqfailures.html</a> United States House
<br>
of Representatives
<br>
<p>Here is what Iraq had in 1998 and has not accounted for:
<br>
<p>.   Iraq has failed to account for 26,500 artillery rockets used for
<br>
delivering nerve gas.
<br>
<p>.   Iraq has failed to account for 5,000 artillery shells filled with
<br>
mustard gas.
<br>
<p>.   Iraq has failed to account for more than 3,000 tons of chemicals used
<br>
for weapons.
<br>
<p>.   Iraq has failed to honor No Fly Zone restrictions by firing on coalition
<br>
aircraft patrolling the area more than 250 times since September 2002.  
<br>
<p>.   Iraq has failed to account for all of its weapons in its recent
<br>
declaration to the United Nations Security Council.  Omissions from the
<br>
declaration include:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq did not account for, at a minimum, 216kg of biological agent growth
<br>
media- enough to produce:
<br>
<p>*   26,000 liters of anthrax- 3 times the amount declared.
<br>
<p>*   1200 liters of botulinum toxin.
<br>
<p>*   5500 liters of clostridium perfrigens- 16 times the amount declared.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq has disclosed manufacturing new energetic fuels suited only to a
<br>
class of missile that it does not admit to having.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq ignores efforts to procure uranium from Niger.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq failed to respond to UN Special Commission requests for more,
<br>
credible, information about VX (nerve gas) production.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq has never adequately accounted for hundreds, possibly thousands
<br>
of tons of chemical precursors.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq has failed to account for nearly 30,000 empty munitions that
<br>
could be filled with chemical agents.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq provides no information about its mobile biological weapon agent
<br>
facilities.  Instead it calls them &quot;refrigeration vehicles and food testing
<br>
laboratories&quot;.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq has upgraded chemical reactors and production equipment at
<br>
Falluja II, one of Baghdad's principal production plants for chemical
<br>
weapons prior to the Gulf War.  Falluja II and other facilities now produce
<br>
more chlorine than is necessary for water treatment- evidence that chlorine
<br>
is being diverted for military purposes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq has started building a new test stand facility clearly intended
<br>
to test long-range missile engines.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq has rebuilt a production facility for long-range solid fuel
<br>
missiles that was dismantled by the UN.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq has openly praised the September 11th attacks
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------
<br>
<p>A few people had also stated, in response to my 'A murderous tyrant controls
<br>
the worlds second largest supply of cheap energy' things to the effect of
<br>
'what can he do with it'

</em><br>
&quot;Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Iraq's growing ability to sell oil illicitly increases Baghdad's
<br>
capabilities to finance WMD programs; annual earnings in cash and goods have
<br>
more than quadrupled. [Since inspections ended in 1998]&quot;
