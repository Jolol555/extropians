### There have been recently some studies showing no improvement in disease

progression in PD patients on selegiline, as well as negative results with

gingko extracts.

<p>Here are some reviews about selegiline:
<br>
<p>Selegiline: a second look. Six years later: too risky in Parkinson's

disease.

<p>Prescrire International. 11(60):108-11, 2002 Aug.
<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
(1) The reference treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa plus a
<br>
peripheral dopadecarboxylase inhibitor (benserazide or carbidopa). (2) In
<br>
1996, selegiline, a type B MAOI marketed in France since 1988, saw its
<br>
indications extended to cover single-agent therapy of early-stage
<br>
Parkinson's disease, and in combination with levodopa, before onset of
<br>
complications of levodopa therapy. The initial clinical file failed to show
<br>
that selegiline had any benefit in these indications. (3) Now, in 2002, new
<br>
data from trials involving hundreds of untreated patients show that
<br>
selegiline postpones the need for levodopa therapy for a few months but
<br>
fails to substantially alter the progression of Parkinson's disease. (4) A
<br>
clinical trial and a retrospective epidemiological study of patients with
<br>
advanced Parkinson's disease showed excess mortality on selegiline. (5) The
<br>
side effects of selegiline are similar to those of other antiparkinsonian
<br>
drugs and amphetamine. Notable side effects include cardiovascular problems
<br>
(postural hypotension, atrial fibrillation and arterial hypertension). (6)
<br>
Selegiline can cause a serotoninergic syndrome and arterial hypertension, so
<br>
must not be combined with pethidine, tramadol, bupropion, sumatriptan,
<br>
zolmitriptan or naratriptan. Concurrent treatment with serotonin reuptake
<br>
inhibitor antidepressants should also be avoided. (7) Given the only
<br>
moderate effects of selegiline in Parkinson's disease, and the possibility
<br>
of a slight increase in mortality, there is no justification for prescribing
<br>
this medication in patients with Parkinson's disease. (8) Whatever the stage
<br>
of Parkinson's disease, there is no justification for starting patients on
<br>
selegiline. Patients who are already taking selegiline should only continue
<br>
to take it if they feel a clear benefit and are free from risk factors for
<br>
early mortality, especially cardiovascular disease

Neuroprotective actions of selegiline.

<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
Selegiline, a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), was one of
<br>
the first adjunct therapies in clinical neurology. A retrospective analysis
<br>
of data from patients with Parkinson's disease found a significant increase
<br>
in survival in those treated with selegiline plus L-dopa compared with
<br>
L-dopa alone. The mechanism of action of selegiline is complex and cannot be
<br>
explained solely by its MAO-B inhibitory action. Pretreatment with
<br>
selegiline can protect neurons against a variety of neurotoxins, such as
<br>
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 6-hydroxydopamine,
<br>
N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4),
<br>
methyl-beta-acetoxyethyl-2-chloroethylamine (AF64A), and
<br>
5,6-dihydroxyserotonin, which damage dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic,
<br>
and sertoninergic neurons, respectively. Selegiline produces an
<br>
amphetamine-like effect, enhances the release of dopamine, and blocks the
<br>
reuptake of dopamine. It stimulates gene expression of L-aromatic amino acid
<br>
decarboxylase, increases striatal phenylethylamine levels, and activates
<br>
dopamine receptors. Selegiline reduces the production of oxidative radicals,
<br>
up-regulates superoxide dismutase and catalase, and suppresses nonenzymatic
<br>
and iron-catalyzed autooxidation of dopamine. Selegiline compensates for
<br>
loss of target-derived trophic support, delays apoptosis in serum-deprived
<br>
cells, and blocks apoptosis-related fall in the mitochondrial membrane
<br>
potential. Most of the aforementioned properties occur independently of
<br>
selegiline's efficacy to inhibit MAO-B. Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

<br>
<p>Abstract
<br>
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of selegiline in the treatment of patients
<br>
with Alzheimer's disease, in terms of cognitive performance, functional
<br>
ability, emotional state (including behaviour and mood) and global response.
<br>
Data Sources The Cochrane database of trials, Embase, Medline and Psychlit.
<br>
Study Selection Unconfounded, double-blind, randomised trials of selegiline
<br>
compared with placebo reported before 31 December 1998. Data Extraction The
<br>
reviewers selected trials for inclusion. Individual patient data were
<br>
sought, but when these could not be retrieved summary data were extracted
<br>
from published papers. RESULTS: Of 27 identified trials, 14 met the
<br>
inclusion criteria. Individual patient data were retrieved from eight trials
<br>
on 821 patients. Summary data were extracted from five trials on 240
<br>
patients. No data were available from one trial on 12 patients, which was
<br>
therefore excluded from the meta-analysis. Fixed and random effects
<br>
meta-analyses were performed on standardised mean differences. For cognition
<br>
there was a statistically significant difference between selegiline and
<br>
placebo at 4-6 weeks and 8-17 weeks after randomisation (at 8-17 weeks:
<br>
smd=0.45 [95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.88]), but this disappeared at
<br>
later assessments. The size of the treatment difference was considered
<br>
unlikely to be of clinical importance. Although there was a statistically
<br>
significant difference at 4-6 weeks for activities of daily living, this
<br>
disappeared at later assessments (at 8-17 weeks: smd=0.33 dot - black
<br>
diamond with white center dot - dot -]; [- dot - black diamond with white
<br>
center dot - dot -]0.33, 0.69]). There were no statistically significant
<br>
differences or clinically relevant differences between selegiline and
<br>
placebo in terms of emotional state or global response. CONCLUSION: Although
<br>
there was some evidence of improvement with selegiline in the short term in
<br>
cognition and activities of daily living, the magnitude of the effect did
<br>
not reach clinical importance. There was no evidence of long term effects.

<p><p>### The data are largely inconclusive, with the studies most favorable to
<br>
selegiline being criticized for methodological failings. Coupled with the
<br>
high cost of Deprenyl, this makes the case for its use quite shaky.
<br>
<p>If I may tout my own prescription for a long life of agile thinking:
<br>
statins.
<br>
<p>Unequivocally shown to prolong survival in patients with atherosclerosis
<br>
(meaning most of us after age 50 or so), now implicated in a possible
<br>
protective effect on Alzheimer's disease (in observational studies only).
