<p>
<em>&gt; The notation &quot;Natural rights&quot; is very *inconvenient* for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason.  First, people do not mean the same thing by it at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many religious people mean something *quite* different from what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary materialists could possibly mean.  Second, it gets very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confused with &quot;natural law&quot; as this thread amply demonstrates.
</em><br>
<p>I won't disagree with that.  But the fact that a term is used
<br>
in ambiguous ways doesn't mean it can't also be used more
<br>
rigorously by people who agree on a foundation.  I think the
<br>
libertarian/anarchocapitalist/individualist interpretation of
<br>
&quot;natural rights&quot; is reasonably consistent and useful, even if
<br>
some of those who use it probably go too far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Third, semantically it would seem to allude to something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists in the *same* sense that laws of physics exist, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints on what is possible.  But human anthropology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much advanced over what it was in Jefferson's day, exposes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this as a complete fallacy:  we now know that insofar as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything like individual rights are concerned, the cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variance is incredible.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but cultural universals are pretty impressive too, and
<br>
there are good reasons for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what then?  Are we to follow your reasoning and suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that human sacrifice is a part of natural law?  Moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess that you've got the ultimate argument that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use to dispose of the socialists:  &quot;You see,&quot; we tell them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Capitalism is just a part of natural law, resistance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futile&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>If sacrifice succeeded more than other cultures of the time
<br>
(which I don't concede for a moment, but I do concede that it
<br>
might be possible), then that only shows that some particular
<br>
complex collection of cultural memes with a certain feature
<br>
out-competed some other complex collection without that feature.
<br>
That says little about the individual feature unless you are
<br>
able to study a very large number of cultures over a long time
<br>
and draw good conclusions.  I suspect that if the correlation
<br>
you posit really existed, it would just be a statistical
<br>
artifact.  On the other hand, something like &quot;supply and
<br>
demand&quot; is more likely to show up as a real &quot;law&quot; of human
<br>
behavior that's universal and exists in exactly the same sense
<br>
that laws of physics exist, even prior to their discovery.
<br>
<p>I will also concede that &quot;natural rights&quot; is a term inherently
<br>
two steps removed from reality in the sense that it implies
<br>
both that there are natural laws of human behavior, and further
<br>
that many of them are expressible in terms of &quot;rights&quot;, which
<br>
are restraints of secondary action.  I.e., when we say that one
<br>
has a &quot;right&quot; to action X, what we mean is that we think it's
<br>
wrong for person B to restrain or punish person A for X, which
<br>
is a cicuitous way of saying that the action of such restraint
<br>
or punishment leads to bad outcomes.  It is probably true that
<br>
there are universals in this form: a culture that restrains or
<br>
punishes political speech is probably doomed to failure, so
<br>
expressing this universal in terms of a &quot;right to free speech&quot;
<br>
is perfectly reasonable.  But there may be other such laws
<br>
that aren't expressible that way, and indeed for which such an
<br>
expression gets in the way of seeing the underlying truth.
