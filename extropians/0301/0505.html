</em><br>
<p>Great way to propagate some memes Christopher! This is my kind
<br>
of social politics.
<br>
<p>Personally one of my all time favourites is Damien Broderick's
<br>
&quot;The Last Mortal Generation&quot; but I may have been being unduly
<br>
swayed by an excellent and challenging title. This is the only book
<br>
that I've even purchased two copies of *(without first reading it)
<br>
just so I could give one away and propagate the meme (in the title).
<br>
(In my defence I had heard about it on the radio, I'm not completely
<br>
superficial ;-) And as it turned out, I don't think she did read it
<br>
<p>Ah well. I think her father may have.
<br>
<p>I read another of Damien's book's &quot;The Spike&quot; later and I think that
<br>
was probably easier reading.
<br>
<p>Damien might not be the sort to plug his own books so I'm happy
<br>
to give these two a wrap. But Damien himself might be a better
<br>
person to comment on which of these books or some books might
<br>
best satisfy your guidelines.
<br>
<p>Damien is one of extropy's leading meme propagators, imho, and
<br>
a poster to this list.

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are some guidelines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -most of the book should be comprehensible to those without an extensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical/scientific vocabulary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -journalistic/outsider voice (point of view) is preferred - usually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insiders are too wrapped up in their awe and anticipation to allow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humor/perspective that is necessary to introduce the meme set to newbies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Preferably the book would cover a lot of ground - providing sci/tech.
</em><br>
basis
<br>
<em>&gt; for transhuman beliefs as well as approaching transhuman issues from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political/ethical/social perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -I would be especially interested in hearing about books that you have
</em><br>
given
<br>
<em>&gt; to newbie friends and have found to be successful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Admittedly this is a tall order and no single book may currently exist.
</em><br>
My
<br>
<em>&gt; current top choice is  Kurzweil's Age of Spiritual machines but maybe
</em><br>
there
<br>
<em>&gt; is a better option out there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the help,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
