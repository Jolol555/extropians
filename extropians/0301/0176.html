<p>Uhhh... Lee, you left out a key part of that quote, thus, with a few 
<br>
selective deletions, changing its meaning to the 180-degree opposite of 
<br>
the original.  Is this a subtle joke?

<p>Maybe I should have written that in the subjunctive mode to be clearer:
<br>
<p>&quot;Existing is different from not existing.  If this weren't the case, then 
<br>
instantiating a particular mind would have no effect; it would already 
<br>
have a Platonic existence or whatever.&quot;
<br>
<p>The reason I did not originally write this way is that we do not know FOR 
<br>
A FACT that existing (instantiation in our own apparent subjective 
<br>
universe) is different from not existing.  But I do tend to use it as a 
<br>
working assumption.
