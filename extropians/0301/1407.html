</em><br>
<p>I don't think, given the what I saw of the actions of a very large
<br>
number of British citizens in the wake of 911 that *they* viewed it
<br>
as an &quot;American problem&quot;.  Nor do I think given the recent events in
<br>
Bali that the Australians view it as an &quot;American problem&quot;.  Nor do
<br>
I suspect that the Philippine, Japanese or South Korean governments
<br>
view it as an &quot;American problem&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would argue that most of the world, including the present administarion,

</em><br>
<p>Let us try to be extropic here -- let is take it out of a purely religious
<br>
context.  As have said in previous messages the problem is &quot;intolerance&quot;.
<br>
The average American anti-abortionist doesn't know squat about &quot;wahabbism&quot;
<br>
but they are card carrying experts in &quot;intolerance&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If one cannot address Islamic Militancy, as a prime threat, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem may indeed worsen. Right now W Bushes comming invasion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq seems the only game in town, because frankly, nobody else is leading.
</em><br>
<p>If you think Islamic Militancy is the primary problem we face then your
<br>
compass has a magnet on the bottom.  No doubt it is certainly a major problem,
<br>
but I'd put aging, AIDS, water resources, esp. in the mideast, and several
<br>
other topics that I have mentioned in other posts as being equal to this
<br>
problem or even more important.
<br>
<p>I am going to go against my normal perspective/framework of considering
<br>
the deaths of 911 unconsionable, unjustifiable and morally outrageous.
<br>
<p>For heaven's sake people we have 40+ million deaths a year from aging,
<br>
probably 10+ million deaths from various infectious diseases and/or
<br>
starvation, a probable death toll from AIDS anywhere in the 50-100 million
<br>
range (far exceeding the 1918 Influenza pandemic death toll and probably
<br>
coming close to the combined death toll of the bubonic plague in the
<br>
6th, 14th and 17th centuries) -- and you are complaining and going
<br>
on and on and on about how we must seek revenge about ~3000 lives
<br>
lost in the 911 events?  Give me a break.
<br>
<p>I feel it as much or more than each of you because I know (in my heart)
<br>
that those lives lost might have lived hundreds or even thousands of years.
<br>
<p>But *put* it into perspective.  The &quot;Rational Thinking&quot; Extropian Principle
<br>
requires that you do this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, both France and Russia are courting Iraq and the Arab world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while bemoaning Islamist attacks on their homelands. Surely, this hypocrisy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not stand. They think that they can dance at two weddings at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, but they can't.
</em><br>
<p>Sure they can.  There are different brides and grooms involved.  I have
<br>
no doubt that various countries can manage to say one thing when
<br>
multi-million dollar contracts are involved and something completely
<br>
different when courting popular opinion when trying to get reelected.
<br>
The multi-million dollar contracts speak *much* louder than the
<br>
(possible -- since this is still very questionable) efforts of
<br>
a few militants to kill a few hundred citizens.  You only have to
<br>
look at Russia and Chechnya over the last 3-5 years to understand this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So who is to avenge those slain on 9-11, and prevent future murderers from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having their way? Little old us, the US.  Arrogantly put, but whom are we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to depend on for help, the Mongolians?
</em><br>
<p>I know this -- that it seems very unlikely that the Mongolians are going
<br>
to help us with aging, hunger/starvation (in fact they are starving
<br>
themselves this winter), AIDS or many of the other problems we as
<br>
extropians face long before one deals with the loss of 3000 lives
<br>
in downtown Manhattan.
<br>
<p>I lived in Manhattan -- I rode in the WTC elevators and once had dinner
<br>
at &quot;Windows on the World&quot;.  I strongly doubt there are many people on the
<br>
list that have a stronger experiential connection to the events of 911
<br>
(its always possible that there are a few) than I.  Every day that
<br>
something about 911 comes up I have to experience the feelings that it
<br>
*isn't* f***ing there any more and I have to think about how many people
<br>
suffered and died in that event.
<br>
<p>And I have to balance those thoughts and feelings (which include a
<br>
relatively heartfelt experiential loss) with my more abstract knowledge
<br>
of aging, starvation, infectious diseases, military tyrants, etc.  And
<br>
I have to see if I can manage to see how to wrestle with them all.
<br>
<p>Wrestling with only one risk to humanity, i.e. wahabbism, seems to
<br>
fail the &quot;rational thinking&quot; test.  You have to be able to stack
<br>
up the wahabbism risk with the asteroid risk with the gamma ray
<br>
burst risk with the breakout of an amoral AI in the Kazaa network risk.
<br>
<p>You (we?) have to figure out ways to have some confidence that someone
<br>
somewhere is &quot;on top of&quot; that risk -- and then we need to learn to
<br>
be comfortable that we have good, talented, responsible people on
<br>
top of said risk and trust they are going to do the best job they
<br>
can do.  If we cannot do that then I'd better go start riding
<br>
Roller Coasters in an attempt to increase my fun quotient before
<br>
my hazard function hits the wall (i.e. maximize my potential for
<br>
some fun before the dust catches up with me).
