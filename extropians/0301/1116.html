<em>&gt; It is worth noting that the death toll (254 seamen)

</em><br>
<p>Yes. I would lke to correct a possible misimpression--I am
<br>
not calling the loss of lives on 9/11 insignificant. I was
<br>
simply trying to cite the Spanish-American war as one where
<br>
some interesting arguments have been made that war was used
<br>
as a tool of policy. I am also not claiming that all of the
<br>
US actions since that time conform to that kind of model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not going to try to justify the current U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy with respect to Iraq (or North Korea).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I'm not sure they can be presented in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rational manner.  But Spike's recent note on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear weapons propagation and use raises the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red flag.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody's asking me, but my assessment at the moment includes:
<br>
Which one is more likely to hand dirty bomb stuff to J. Random Badguy?
<br>
Which one is more likely to mass troops and send them through tunnels
<br>
that have been being built since 1950? This tempers the simpleminded
<br>
&quot;Nukes bad. Korea got nukes. Iraq don't. Why we attack Iraq first?&quot;
<br>
Kim is watching what we do in the Middle East. This is not a perfect-
<br>
information situation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This isn't about being &quot;right&quot;, it isn't about advancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones own political perspective (the entire libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. some other political framework fades and exits stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left in this forum), it isn't about whether having or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not having guns is a way to move forward a perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is about whether or not the information content that we,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a species and civilization, have accumulated, is maintained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hopefully evolved.
</em><br>
<p>Well said, friend Robert.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, there are some tradeoffs, and some &quot;evolutions&quot;, I
<br>
find repugnant.
<br>
<p>&quot;Evolution&quot; is a complex word, and different meanings have different
<br>
ramifications. I'm told there is a wading bird that only uses its
<br>
wings to shade its eyes while it looks for food in the water.
<br>
Such a bird is highly evolved--but flightless.
<br>
<p>I'd prefer H. sap species survival to H. sap species extinction, sure.
<br>
I'd also prefer plenty to penury, and _civilization_ to subjugation.
