<p><em>&gt; Uhhh... Lee, [as you quoted me] you left out a key part of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quote, thus, with a few selective deletions, changing its meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the 180-degree opposite of the original.  Is this a subtle joke?
</em><br>
<p>No, certainly not.  Sorry about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer [I] really wrote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Morality is a function over 4D spacetimes, not 3D spaces.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  terminate an existing mind, the termination event is undesirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Declining to create a *new* unhappy mind is not morally equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  *killing* an unhappy mind.
</em><br>
<p>I wanted to demur here
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Existing is different from not existing.
</em><br>
<p>and agree here, but bungled it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If this isn't the case, then instantiating a particular mind has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  effect; it already has a Platonic existence or whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Whether or not &quot;this isn't the case&quot; I disagree with you here.
<br>
I'm sure that you agree that no benefit accrues to patterns
<br>
which don't get physically instantiated and run.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If instantiating a mind *does* make a moral difference, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among the moral differences it makes is that *now* the mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has civil rights.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, if some legislative body grants them, I suppose.
<br>
You still want to derive *rights* from some objective
<br>
feature of the universe, and I suppose that we are
<br>
still at loggerheads.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe I should have written that in the subjunctive mode to be clearer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Existing is different from not existing.  If this weren't the case, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantiating a particular mind would have no effect; it would already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a Platonic existence or whatever.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason I did not originally write this way is that we do not know FOR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A FACT that existing (instantiation in our own apparent subjective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe) is different from not existing.  But I do tend to use it as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working assumption.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  And it may save writing to suppose that everyone does
<br>
until you meet a counter-example.
