</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why does the USA still have troops in rich Europe? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Good point. Why? 
</em><br>
<p>It *is* a good question.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why did Rome still have troops throughout the rich Empire? 
</em><br>
<p>And it deserves a serious response, which *perhaps* 
<br>
this is.  Rome kept troops throughout the Roman
<br>
Empire mainly to man the frontiers against incursions
<br>
from raiders.
<br>
<p>However, Rome had in almost all cases conquered those
<br>
nations quite against the wishes of the native tribes
<br>
and population.  (But in most areas, anti-Roman feeling
<br>
gave way in a generation or so, because of the peace
<br>
and security they received.)
<br>
<p>Since the sixties, wouldn't it be incorrect to say that
<br>
British, French, and American forces were still &quot;occupying&quot;
<br>
Germany?  And except for Germany, it would be incorrect
<br>
to suggest that American bases in Europe were obtained
<br>
by military force.
<br>
<p>I really would like to know why American forces are
<br>
still in Europe; the Soviet Union doesn't exist any
<br>
more, and Russia no longer is so menacing.
<br>
<p>I think that Europeans (or their governments) want
<br>
American bases in Europe, and that for some unknown
<br>
reason (to me) the Americans continue to stay.  (It's
<br>
awfully expensive!)  But I could be wrong.
<br>
<p>What is the correct explanation?
<br>
<p>Lee
