You know, in his book,  Saucer Wisdom, Rudy Rucker had one of his characters 
<br>
indicate that &quot;aliens are raining down on us all the time. We just don't have 
<br>
the tech yet to unzip them yet.&quot; Rucker had copies (clones) of beings or tour 
<br>
groups visiting other worlds, including earth and having the capability to 
<br>
unarchive themselves, usually as inhabitants of UFO's. The book was written 
<br>
with tongue in cheek, but was basically a mechanism to explore Rucker's ideas 
<br>
on future technology. Much of the tech was vividly described, but unlikely as 
<br>
an actual development. Your post triggered a remembrance of this. :-)

<p>&quot;Hello my name is Lee Corbin.  Yes I am an integer
<br>
but my pattern is that of a real person existing
<br>
on Earth 2003 AD.  I am less than a google long
<br>
but still as you will see there is no doubt that
<br>
I am he.  I have his DNA, his memories, his beliefs
<br>
and personality dispositions.  Consult the weighty
<br>
table of contents directly following...&quot;&gt;&gt;
