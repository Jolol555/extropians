Reuters is reporting at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=UBU1RYMPSKL4ECRBAELCFFA?type=scienceNews&amp;storyID=2052591">http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=UBU1RYMPSKL4ECRBAELCFFA?type=scienceNews&amp;storyID=2052591</a><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fertility techniques and cloning can increase the odds of babies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;developing a rare childhood illness which predisposes them to birth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defects and cancer, scientists reported on Wednesday.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children born through assisted reproduction methods such as in-vitro
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fertilization (IVF) are up to four times more likely to suffer from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, which is linked with a genetic phenomenon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known as imprinting.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A baby created through cloning would have an even higher risk because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the technique interferes with imprinting, which controls the activity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of certain genes involved in the growth of the baby in the womb and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behavior traits.
<br>
<p>In some of our recent discussion on human cloning, it was suggested
<br>
that the technology should not be implemented until safety concerns
<br>
are addressed.  Now it appears that IVF, which has been in common use
<br>
for 20 years, also has safety issues.
<br>
<p>How do we balance the risk to our children against our desire to
<br>
reproduce?  When is it OK to use a new technology to have a child that
<br>
would not otherwise be possible, if that technology also carries an
<br>
increased risk of birth defects?
