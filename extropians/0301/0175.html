<em>&gt;To illustrate, consider the integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  8051212150013250014011305000919001205050003151802
</em><br>
<em>&gt;09140000002505190009000113000114000914200507051802
</em><br>
which by a most transparent cipher reads
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Hello my name is Lee Corbin.  Yes I am an integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but my pattern is that of a real person existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on Earth 2003 AD.  I am less than a google long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but still as you will see there is no doubt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am he.  I have his DNA, his memories, his beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and personality dispositions.  Consult the weighty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;table of contents directly following...&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>If human code were capable to run all the variations of human combinations 
<br>
what would that solve?
<br>
<p>Obviously you would have to define all the combinations of humans as &quot;All 
<br>
genetic and enviromental factors which cause the human code to change&quot;. In 
<br>
other words, all the humans would have the same code with out these factors. 
<br>
If the combinations were to have new genes and new traits they would be 
<br>
inhuman. Or if the combinations would live in a new enviroment and get new 
<br>
stimuli they would be inhuman. So a certain set of factors has to be 
<br>
established to define the non-existing human combinations. Wouldn't these 
<br>
combinations change as the alive humans change and they have different genes 
<br>
and have different enviroments?
<br>
<p>The awnser is the human code can only be defined in the present for a second 
<br>
later it has changed.
<br>
<p>What mathematical formula could we use to define the changeing human code?
<br>
<p>Being human is it possible for our code to predict the future and then 
<br>
predict ourselves?
