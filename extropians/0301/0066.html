<br>
<p>A number of years ago, the L-5 society was practically torn in two by a very 
<br>
divisive issue: President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative that would 
<br>
militarize Space while opening it up for settlement. It seemed that half the 
<br>
membership were peace-loving hippies, while the other half were military 
<br>
personal convinced that SDI was the only way out of the Mutual Assured 
<br>
Destruction. Personally, I was torn not only because I had friends on both 
<br>
sides, but because my own sympathies were divided.
<br>
<p>Wisely, the L-5 leadership refused to take sides in this ideological battle, 
<br>
and the organization survived to merge with National Space Institute to form 
<br>
the present National Space Society. It may be slightly premature today 
<br>
(perhaps not, given Geron Inc.'s recent lengthening of telomeres), but I see 
<br>
the MMSG and the nanotech community coming to a similar juncture with 
<br>
respect to Transhumanism. Twice before in our nation's history have we been 
<br>
faced with the question of what it means to be human. The first time we 
<br>
flubbed it badly, and brother slaughtered brother in the bloodiest war this 
<br>
nation ever fought. The second time, which we are now experiencing, the 
<br>
issue is more abstract, and twenty years went by before anyone was shot, but 
<br>
the issue still tears a hole in the heart of this nation. With 
<br>
transhumanism, the issue will be even more visible than in the case of 
<br>
slavery, and it will not be possible to avoid taking sides on the issue.
<br>
<p>Introduction
<br>
<p>It seems that the molecular manufacturing revolution will be the last one 
<br>
for the human race. This is because we are made of atoms, and since we will 
<br>
have the ability to remake ourselves, we will. So we must ask the difficult 
<br>
question of what it means to be human. The concept of a Transhuman has been 
<br>
coined to describe what comes after Homo Sapiens, but what does that really 
<br>
mean for us, the ordinary humans? Are we individually transformed, or just 
<br>
sloughed off like old skin cells?
<br>
<p>In order to seriously consider the issue of transhumanism, a few approaches 
<br>
should be considered, and we need to understand the following:
<br>
<p>The precise characteristics of a Transhuman being, with an unambiguous 
<br>
definition of terms
<br>
The technological steps necessary to the emergence of the Transhuman race
<br>
The assumptions of the Transhumanist Imperative
<br>
Historical events that may alert us to potential pitfalls.
<br>
Keep in mind that predicting the future under such chaotic conditions is a 
<br>
type of lunacy engaged only by angels and fools, which is probably why it is 
<br>
so much fun. Unfortunately, I cannot provide any clear answers -- at best 
<br>
I've tried to ask difficult questions that may hopefully permit others to 
<br>
reach the correct conclusions.
<br>
<p>Characteristics of a Transhuman Being
<br>
<p>What does it mean to achieve the Transhuman condition? At first glance, it 
<br>
is obvious that the Transhuman should be smarter, stronger, healthier, and 
<br>
better than us in every way. But the word &quot;better&quot; has some interesting 
<br>
connotations when we look at the concept of transhumanism in closer detail. 
<br>
Would the Transhuman be a better voter, or a better consumer, or a better 
<br>
politician? More fun-loving? Less suicidal? Would he/she/it be more ethical, 
<br>
more legalistic, or completely amoral? Would the Transhuman be an 
<br>
individual, or a hive mind?
<br>
<p>Comparing ourselves to our prehominid ancestors, it is obvious that in terms 
<br>
of muscular strength, we are not stronger than they are. A 150 pound 
<br>
chimpanzee can throw Arnold Schwarzenegger across the room. On the other 
<br>
hand, our tools enable us to force our desires over all other animals -- 
<br>
this is why humans rule Earth, albeit often inefficiently and capriciously.
<br>
<p>In addition to tools and other physical artifacts that manipulate the 
<br>
environment with more horsepower and/or precision than muscles can deliver, 
<br>
humans rule this planet because of their social inventions, including 
<br>
language, writing, political hierarchies, and money. Obviously, our 
<br>
intelligence is the trait that differentiates us more than any other from 
<br>
every other Terran species. So it seems reasonable that Transhomo 
<br>
individuals will be more intelligent than ourselves. This can occur by 
<br>
increasing bandwidth of the interface of people and computers. For example, 
<br>
my letters and articles in every field are much better if I write them while 
<br>
I have the world's knowledge at my fingertips -- i.e. access to the World 
<br>
Wide Web. In terms of data processing, however, the Web itself is a static 
<br>
repository of knowledge facts, ideas, and links. The Foresight Institute is 
<br>
trying to make the Web more effective by including back links, which will 
<br>
effectively double the types of relationships that ideas can have. Image how 
<br>
much it might improve when the links are as rich as those in linguistic 
<br>
networks and natural language software, and as active as processors in 
<br>
neural networks. Actually, Java applets may be one mechanism by which this 
<br>
could occur. At some point then, such enhancements may enable the Web to 
<br>
&quot;wake up&quot; into one form of a Transhuman.
<br>
<p>Before going any farther in analyzing the Transhumanist viewpoint, it is 
<br>
important to be as objective as possible. Of course, this is impossible, but 
<br>
stating some fundamental assumptions will make open discussion more 
<br>
fruitful. I believe in Existence, Truth, and Love. Translated in the real 
<br>
world, that means that I fight to survive, because if I'm dead, then nothing 
<br>
else has much value to me. Second, it is important for me to learn as much 
<br>
as possible about my surrounding environment (i.e. the whole universe) and 
<br>
my place in it. This will increase my chances for survival, and help me love 
<br>
wisely. Finally, my positive relationships with everyone with whom I come 
<br>
into contact will make my survival and learning worthwhile. There are a 
<br>
number of concepts implicit in this world-view, including the idea that the 
<br>
universe is real, that it is at least partially knowable, and that it is 
<br>
worth living in.
<br>
<p>My philosophical bias stated, let's take a look at the Transhumanist 
<br>
Principles:
<br>
<p>1. Transcend: Strive to remove the evolved limits of our biological and 
<br>
intellectual inheritance, the physical limits of our environment, and the 
<br>
cultural and historical limits of society that constrain individual and 
<br>
collective progress.
<br>
<p>2. Pragmatism: Use whatever tools prove effective toward this goal. 
<br>
Technology, and the intellectual disciplines used to develop it, are 
<br>
currently among the most effective such tools.
<br>
<p>3. Memetic propagation. Support the proliferation of transhumanist 
<br>
principles and goals, consciously setting an example that others may follow 
<br>
or promoting the principles of transhumanism directly. Spread awareness of 
<br>
the dangers of technophobia, coercion, anti-humanism and other destructive 
<br>
ideologies.
<br>
<p>4. Achievement. Whether seeking health, fitness, intellectual goals, or 
<br>
financial or social success or political accomplishment, strive to achieve 
<br>
your individual ambitions. Cooperate with other innovators and optimists to 
<br>
reach goals both personal and global.
<br>
<p>5. Diversity. Promote human efforts to grow and adapt to an ever-changing 
<br>
universe. Tolerate people of all schools of thought that do not seek to 
<br>
limit the extent or variety of your achievement. Discourage any attempts to 
<br>
impose will or ideas through coercion.
<br>
<p>6. Evolution. These principles should evolve, in order to address the needs 
<br>
of future Transhumanity; but resist any change in the principles that limits 
<br>
Transhuman activity.
<br>
<p>These principles sound as good as motherhood and apple pie, but they deserve 
<br>
a closer look. The first point seems to make &quot;Trancend&quot; a goal of 
<br>
self-actualization and self-realization. Self-realization seems to be a 
<br>
restatement of Socrates' dictum, &quot;Know thyself&quot;, and as such seems very 
<br>
good. It seems to me that an important aspect of self-realization is to know 
<br>
your limits. For example, if I'm standing on the top of the Empire State 
<br>
Building, and I want to get to the bottom quickly, it is important to accept 
<br>
the fact that I if I just step off, then the consequences are not very 
<br>
conducive to my survival. On the other hand, what if I have a parachute? Or 
<br>
(a few years from now) what if I've redesigned my body into a T-1000 
<br>
Terminator so that I could survive the fall? In the first case, I may 
<br>
frighten a few people and break a city ordinance. In the second, if I land 
<br>
on a non-augmented human (perhaps an Amish tourist), the impact will kill 
<br>
him. In both cases, my own survival is not directly affected by my actions, 
<br>
but that of other people's is. Is this important? From a pragmatic 
<br>
viewpoint, it depends on how much I depend on them. The fact of the matter 
<br>
is that we are social animals, and our technology is a social construct. 
<br>
Therefore our survival depends on other people, most of whom we will never 
<br>
meet. Thus enlightened self-interest informs me that I should not endanger 
<br>
other people because of their limitations, even if my choices pose no danger 
<br>
to myself. But what if society mandates uncomfortable dress codes, allows 
<br>
economic slavery, penalizes creativity, and generally infringes on my 
<br>
freedom? In that case, how much should I respect it? It seems that this 
<br>
tension between society and the individual will exist in the Transhuman 
<br>
condition as much as our own.
<br>
<p>The second Transhumanist principle of pragmatism is another wonderful 
<br>
sounding principle that seems nebulous up close. Pragmatic choices are 
<br>
always made in light of specific goals, but pragmatism is only a means to an 
<br>
end. If the end is not specified, someone could use pragmatic means to 
<br>
achieve evil goals.
<br>
<p>In the Transhumanist Principles, the word &quot;limit&quot; is applied to five 
<br>
different fields: the biological, intellectual, the physical, cultural, and 
<br>
historical. The usage insinuates that we should rebel against all natural 
<br>
limits. Is the use of the word &quot;natural&quot; as in the laws of physics, or as in 
<br>
the nature of being human?
<br>
<p>If it is used in the first sense, then is there any value to being 
<br>
&quot;natural&quot;? Are human beings &quot;natural&quot;? Thalomide and Chyrnoble should teach 
<br>
us to be humble with our tool-making intelligence, but as Peter Kohk points 
<br>
out, if human beings don't develop the technology to build a Space-faring 
<br>
civilization, the next KT meteor will wipe out 99% of the Terran species, 
<br>
including us. Such an interspecies &quot;White Man's Burden&quot; is as inescapable as 
<br>
it is heavy.
<br>
<p>If the word natural is used in the second sense, then what does it really 
<br>
mean to rebel against what we are? As a tool-using species, it is human 
<br>
nature to manipulate our environment. This isn't a technological issue, but 
<br>
a metaphysical one, similar to the ones that philosophers engage when 
<br>
debating the essence, form, and nature of things. As finite primates, I 
<br>
suspect that we must recognize our inherent nature (e.g. social animals made 
<br>
of atoms and utilizing energy) and when we make decisions in accordance with 
<br>
these insights into our true character, we will be most effective in 
<br>
reaching our goals. But what ought those goals be? What is our true nature? 
<br>
How malleable is it, even if we can manipulate every atom in our bodies? 
<br>
What is it about us, that if we change it, then we are no longer humans? 
<br>
Putting a name on it (Transhuman) doesn't explain anything.
<br>
<p>Everyone certainly works to achieve goals, but it is obvious that what most 
<br>
of the world thinks of transcendant goals for most of human history are not 
<br>
listed in the Transhumanist list. The goals listed are significantly 
<br>
materialistic, and in fact are quite low on Maslow's hierarchy. People 
<br>
respect heroes like Ghandi, Jesus, and Buddah because the goals they set 
<br>
touched a need far deeper than health, fitness, money, or power.
<br>
<p>The science of ecology has shown that diversity aids survival. However, as 
<br>
David Brin points out, valuing diversity for its own stake is 
<br>
self-contradictory, and there are other values may be considerably more 
<br>
important than diversity (e.g. personal and species survival).
<br>
<p>The Transhumanist Principles proclaim that coercion should be discouraged, 
<br>
which sounds like a worthwhile goal, but how is this to be accomplished? Is 
<br>
it to be taxed, with the military might of the government behind it? What 
<br>
would prevent a psychotic killer from running amok? What prevents an 
<br>
abortionist from destroying an 8-month-old fetus in one wing of a hospital 
<br>
while in another wing, a doctor tries to save the life of patient of the 
<br>
same age? Should an entity's personhood depend on whether or not he/she/it 
<br>
is wanted? On what grounds does a prosecutor charge a person who shoots 
<br>
abortionists? Is it because abortionists are old enough to vote for 
<br>
prosecutors? Nanotechnology will undoubtedly make birth control 100% 
<br>
effective, so the abortion issue should go away. But the Transhumanist 
<br>
Principles do not address the underlying issues involved in the abortion 
<br>
debate -- the definition of personhood and the inalienability of a human's 
<br>
right to life. These unresolved underlying issues will return with a 
<br>
vengeance. There have been 35 million abortions (i.e. failures of birth 
<br>
control) since Roe v. Wade, and this is with birth control methods that are 
<br>
generally more than 90% effective. It doesn't matter what one's beliefs 
<br>
about abortion are, something is wrong with this picture, and I am afraid 
<br>
that the emergence of Transhumans will magnify the confusion.
<br>
<p>A Transhumanist position against anti-humanism also seems commendable, but 
<br>
it contradicts the last point of evolving with no limits on Transhuman 
<br>
activity. What if Transhumans mutate in to a form of anti-humanism? Unless 
<br>
everyone becomes Transhuman (some people will refuse for emotional and/or 
<br>
religious reasons), what happens to the ones who stay behind? Will they 
<br>
become beloved pets? Or legally protected endangered species that can be 
<br>
poached with little consequences?
<br>
<p>Finally, the above Transhumanist principles seem very self-referential - 
<br>
they don't say very much because so much is left undefined.
<br>
<p>Steps to the emergence of Transhomo Sapiens.
<br>
<p>In order to pave the way for Transhomo Sapiens, we must be able to augment 
<br>
and rebuild ourselves in a number of different ways. The steps on the way to 
<br>
becoming Transhuman involve the human-directed assembly or growth of new 
<br>
person-like entities including:
<br>
<p>Clones - differently aged identical twins (Daisy shows that we're just one 
<br>
step away. Actually, fairly reliable rumor has it that human cloning has 
<br>
already been done, but the embryos were destroyed).
<br>
Bio-enhanced humans - primitive examples include humans with artificial aids 
<br>
such as steroids or pacemakers. More advanced examples included enhanced 
<br>
telemerase production (as demonstrated last year by Geron Corporation) and 
<br>
brainstem implants.
<br>
Cyborgs - human brains encased in (possibly specialized) robotic bodies. 
<br>
These are extreme cases of bio-enhanced humans.
<br>
Xoxes -- atomically identical copies of humans; instant clones with 
<br>
identical brain structure and hence the same memories.
<br>
Doppelgangers - modified xoxes.
<br>
Corpsicles - People whose hearts have stopped, and are by current definition 
<br>
dead, but their blood is replaced with antifreeze, and their bodies frozen 
<br>
in liquid nitrogen -- in the hope that they can be thawed and repaired. 
<br>
Drexler wryly calls them people with whole-body frostbite. This is a 
<br>
last-ditch experimental medical procedure aimed at saving someone's life.
<br>
Uplifts - animals with Homo Sapiens-level intelligence (through genetic 
<br>
engineering or other techniques).
<br>
HEC - Human Equivalent Computer (in raw switching power, this will likely 
<br>
happen within the next year or two, depending on which assumptions on 
<br>
makes.).
<br>
Artificial Intelligence agents-- software that passes the Turing Test, 
<br>
possibly modeled on existing humans.
<br>
Androids - humanoid robots with an artificial brains. Requires that AI 
<br>
agents work as expected.
<br>
Uploads -- software that simulates people's thought processes to the point 
<br>
that they are not only seem to be people, but that they are actually the 
<br>
people they simulate (we will leave as an exercise for the reader to 
<br>
determine in what sense -- i.e. objectively or subjectively -- this is 
<br>
really real).
<br>
HINTs -Hyper Intelligent Nanotech Transhumans - humans who have used 
<br>
nanotechnology to increase their memory capacity, processing speed, and raw 
<br>
brainpower
<br>
One particular bio-enhancement is the ability to live longer with more 
<br>
youthful bodies -- a goal which has been drawing closer as medical 
<br>
technology learns more about how the human body works at a molecular level. 
<br>
An additional advantage of achieving this goal is that not only do we get to 
<br>
build the first Transhuman, but we might also get to become one.
<br>
<p>As psychoactive drugs are designed for particular mental diseases, it is 
<br>
natural to ask, where does the disease end, and where does the personality 
<br>
begin? If you underwent a treatment that permanently removed a severe 
<br>
tendency to ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), would the resultant person 
<br>
really be you? What if you were psychologically disturbed because of a 
<br>
childhood or prenatal trauma? Can we simply remove the memory of the trauma, 
<br>
or must we do a lot more in order to heal someone? If we follow the former 
<br>
option, then we would need to also remove the natural reaction to the 
<br>
trauma. But given the holographic nature of the brain, this means adjusting 
<br>
billions of neurons. Will you still be you after such an adjustment?
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is obviously an outgrowth of humanism, so it would be 
<br>
worthwhile to examine some of the issues surrounding ordinary humanism. Even 
<br>
though humanism is derived from the joining of Greek and Judeo-Christian 
<br>
values, the Catholic Church has been a tireless critic of some aspects of 
<br>
humanistic philosophy for hundreds of years. So some of her theologians have 
<br>
had a lot of time to think about some of these issues, and their reasoning 
<br>
may be instructive. Currently, they have only addressed, with mixed results, 
<br>
three of the steps toward the emergence of Transhumans.
<br>
<p>Mother Teresa had a pacemaker, leading one to infer that the Church does not 
<br>
consider bio-enhancement intrinsically wrong, although some methods may be 
<br>
considered illicit (e.g. treating Parkinson's disease with aborted fetal 
<br>
tissue, or transplanting the organs of condemned criminals).
<br>
<p>Cloning is considered immoral for the same reason that birth control is 
<br>
condemned -- it drastically separates the unitive and procreative aspects of 
<br>
the ultimate physical expression of love. This depends on the Aristotelian 
<br>
and Thomastic views of &quot;natural law&quot;, which determines the &quot;nature&quot; of a 
<br>
thing by looking at it's purpose, presupposing one who &quot;gives purpose.&quot; At 
<br>
any rate, it is not clear why this separation is &quot;intrinsically disordered.&quot;
<br>
<p>A recently approved document, Identity and Status of the Human Embryo has 
<br>
stated that &quot;The embryo is a human being from the moment of conception and 
<br>
should be treated as such.&quot; The document regards as ''aberrant and morally 
<br>
illicit'' the in vitro production of embryos for commercial or industrial 
<br>
use, human cloning, the use of human embryos to produce ''monsters'', and 
<br>
the production of animal-human ''hybrids'' by transferring human embryos 
<br>
into animal wombs and vice versa. The Church has often spoken against in 
<br>
vitro fertilization (the source of most frozen embryos), again because of it 
<br>
separates the unitive and procreative aspects of sex, but she maintains that 
<br>
all frozen embryos should be ''guaranteed the chance of life.'' Pope John 
<br>
Paul recently spoke on the ''inalienable rights'' of frozen embryos and said 
<br>
that ''the fairest answer to the question of whether or not these unwanted 
<br>
embryos should be killed came from the German parliament, which proclaimed 
<br>
the embryo's right to live in 1991.'' This indicates that the Catholic 
<br>
Church seems to have accepted cryonics without a blink, contrary to the 
<br>
deathoid prejudices of many Christian fundamentalists. Then again, after 
<br>
apologizing about her role in the Galileo affair, she also seems to have 
<br>
accepted most of Darwinian evolution, while holding fast to the beliefs on 
<br>
faith and morals that she has taught for 2000 years. This combination of 
<br>
flexibility and stability is unusual for any human organization, much less 
<br>
for the world's oldest. Then again, perhaps her longevity may be explained 
<br>
by it. There may be important lessons here when human life spans reach 
<br>
thousands of years.
<br>
<p>Assumptions
<br>
<p>With any issue, it is the unstated assumptions that usually hide the most 
<br>
serious errors. For example, Meadow's famous &quot;Limits to Growth&quot; computer 
<br>
program predicted the collapse of human civilization by 1990, after assuming 
<br>
that the human environment stopped at the upper edge of the atmosphere, and 
<br>
that technological progress would stop. What are the unstated assumptions of 
<br>
the Transhuman condition?
<br>
<p>Progress: The idea that humans are getting better and better naturally 
<br>
assumes that we will eventually surpass ourselves. Forgetting for a minute 
<br>
that anthropologists consider the 20th century the &quot;Genocide Era&quot;, the 
<br>
concept of human progress is an article of faith with some support. For 
<br>
example, technology has transformed our lives in many ways, and many of 
<br>
those ways are good. However, it is presumptuous to assume that this 
<br>
progress will enable us to build something better than ourselves in our 
<br>
essence. Though of course we will be able to build mechanisms that surpass 
<br>
us in any of our well-defined characteristics -- for example bulldozers and 
<br>
computers can move dirt and symbols better than humans can. Two software 
<br>
programs, AM and EURISKO, caution against the optimistic view of attaining 
<br>
or surpassing human self-creation. These programs were designed to modify 
<br>
themselves, and were moderately successful at it -- AM &quot;discovered&quot; prime 
<br>
number and Goldbach's conjecture, while Eurisko won the world championship 
<br>
Traveler's War game two years running. However, as Lenat himself eventually 
<br>
admitted, AM and Eurisko &quot;seemed&quot; to work by using a very quick &quot;generate 
<br>
and test&quot; paradigm that was dependent on the richness of the syntax and 
<br>
semantics of the underlying symbolic language on which it was written. 
<br>
Actually, Lenat's work, as related to genetic algorithms, turned out to be 
<br>
very useful at efficiently covering a solution space, but not at extending 
<br>
it in new dimensions. We just haven't figured out how to do that.
<br>
Suffering: Transhumanism does not seem to have any coherent view of 
<br>
suffering except as something to be avoided at all costs. Physically, that 
<br>
may become possible, but even it there is a fair and just distribution of 
<br>
seemingly endless resources, as long as Transhumans are finite beings, it 
<br>
seems inconceivable that mental suffering will end. And since suffering will 
<br>
exist, what is the best way to deal with it? The five ancient religions of 
<br>
the world have survived for so long because they provide concrete ways for 
<br>
people to deal with suffering. In Greg Bear's science fiction story Queen of 
<br>
Angels, 99% of the population is under psychiatric care, and most are 
<br>
augmenting themselves in some way, insinuating that the psychological 
<br>
therapy is one answer to suffering. But psychiatrist Dr. Scott Peck points 
<br>
out in The Road Less Traveled that the essential cause of neurosis is the 
<br>
avoidance of legitimate suffering. People may come to a psychiatrist in 
<br>
order to avoid their suffering, but in order for their anguish to be healed, 
<br>
they must be willing to lean into their own pain.
<br>
Evil: The Transhumanist philosophy doesn't seem to recognize that evil 
<br>
exists in this world (proof which can be found every night on the evening 
<br>
news), nor does it offer any remedy for it. This is a fatal oversight.
<br>
Humanism: The assumption that humanism is the only correct viewpoint 
<br>
pervades the Transhumanism. But is all world views make this assumption, 
<br>
except ultra-tolerance, which is self-contradictory. Humanism certainly has 
<br>
its share of problems. For example, the claim is made that humans determine 
<br>
their own reason for existence. But we do not create ourselves. Certainly 
<br>
people try, but can you imagine listening to a musician who has no talent? 
<br>
Perhaps a Transhuman will simply load the proper software module, but will 
<br>
that type of &quot;music&quot; be appreciated as being anything new under the sun? Any 
<br>
career counselor will tell you that careers are not chosen at whim but 
<br>
discovered when people understand themselves better.
<br>
Transhumanism as Religion
<br>
<p>Anders Sandberg points out that Transhumanism is currently a religion:
<br>
<p>The transhumanist memes often bind to memetic receptors normally linked to 
<br>
religious memes, at least the typical western monotheistic religions. Both 
<br>
types of memes have similar baits: the promise of a brighter future, health, 
<br>
prosperity, freedom, happiness, immortality and eventual transcendence. The 
<br>
difference is mainly how these changes should be achieved and what 
<br>
implications they have. Both memes protect the host from many negative 
<br>
emotions by providing an explanation for things and most importantly a 
<br>
future goal... this is both good news and bad news for transhumanism. 
<br>
Religoid memes have shown themselves to be extremely successful. But they 
<br>
also often promote irrationality and mindless acceptance of the meme. And 
<br>
transhumanism runs the risk of being subjected to convergent evolution, to 
<br>
end up a religion.
<br>
<p>He seems to say this as if it were a bad thing. He does not seem to realize 
<br>
that any belief that is accepted without proof is, essentially religious 
<br>
dogma, and that it is impossible for even a robot to navigate across a room 
<br>
without the assistance of many non-provable assumptions about reality.
<br>
<p>Sandberg also claims that Christianity and Transhumanism don't necessarily 
<br>
contradict each other, especially in the format of Teilhard de Chardin's 
<br>
Omega Point. The idea that the entire universe will eventually become one 
<br>
mind seems ludicrous until we realize that with molecular nanotechnology we 
<br>
will be able to transform planets into Utility Fog, and stars into Dyson 
<br>
Spheres. So from a scientific point of view, the idea of a human-derived 
<br>
civilization reconstructing the universe into the Omega Point seems 
<br>
plausible, if not inevitable. However, the Omega Point is also identified 
<br>
with God, so our constructing it would be re-making God in our own image, 
<br>
and/or ultimately becoming God. Unfortunately, the three monotheistic 
<br>
religions of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, claim that Adam and Eve got 
<br>
kicked out of the Garden of Eden for attempting to do just that. For that 
<br>
reason alone, they will not embrace the pantheistic hubris of the Omega 
<br>
Point.
<br>
<p>Historical Lessons.
<br>
<p>What is the logical conclusion of these assumptions? As Richard Neuhaus put 
<br>
it, every atrocity begins with an error. Therefore, the implementation of 
<br>
any self-contradictory philosophy will result in disaster. Stalin believed 
<br>
that human beings were basically good, but that society was corrupting them. 
<br>
He also believed that the end justified the means. Because of these two 
<br>
incorrect beliefs, he liquidated 20 million of his own people. Pol Pot 
<br>
shared similar beliefs and butchered half his own people in the killing 
<br>
fields of Cambodia. More to the point, another group of people shared with 
<br>
Transhumanism the idea of building a post-human race. They called their 
<br>
proposed descendants the Master Race, and today, no other group has earned 
<br>
itself such a secure title to evil. The emotional overtones of Nazism is so 
<br>
powerful that even mentioning it causes people to stop thinking. But in 
<br>
fact, it should make each group reflect on how their own philosophy may be 
<br>
in some ways similar to what the Nazis believed. It may be most useful to 
<br>
separate the philosophy of Nazism from its nationalism and its 
<br>
anti-Semitism, both of which contributed to its popularity. What remains may 
<br>
be more easily compared to beliefs popular globally in the 1930s, and even 
<br>
today. If the Transhuman becomes a hive entity, then it would be very 
<br>
similar to the Nazi idea of the fatherland, and the communist idea of the 
<br>
State. This does not mean that it is wrong to sacrifice for one's group -- 
<br>
such self-sacrifice is beneficial for everyone under many conditions. 
<br>
However, the error occurs when every individual is given a lower priority 
<br>
than the idealized conglomerate, when in actuality it is the group that 
<br>
exists for the benefit of the individual in a synergistic relationship.
<br>
<p>Another, more serious error that the Nazis made was differentiating between 
<br>
various grades of humanity, based on their capabilities and genetic 
<br>
endowment. Will augmented people make the same differentiation? Probably -- 
<br>
it is an easy temptation to fall into. When I competed in the arena as an 
<br>
All American wrestler, it was difficult not to look down on the &quot;poor 
<br>
spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray 
<br>
twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.&quot; The feeling of superiority is a 
<br>
very comforting feeling, especially after losing something of value. In the 
<br>
case of the German people after the humiliation of WWI, many were probably 
<br>
helpless to the seduction of feeling superior. Will a collapse of Social 
<br>
Security around 2010 have the same impact? Will the crisis McKendree 
<br>
mentioned earlier set up a fatal scenario?
<br>
<p>The closest America has come to publicly admitting Nazi-like behavior is My 
<br>
Lai. In People of the Lie, Peck examined the atrocities there and concluded 
<br>
that his study &quot; revealed the operation of gross intellectual laziness and 
<br>
pathological narcissism at every level.&quot; From the point of view of a 
<br>
psychiatrist, Peck has described the pathology of evil, and Transhumanism 
<br>
has no defense against it. Specifically, evil begins with a person's 
<br>
narcissistic tendencies that are warped by an over-riding fear of criticism. 
<br>
This delusion of perfection prevents self-correction, and results in the 
<br>
person lying first to themselves, and then to everyone else. After the lies 
<br>
come fraud, abuse, and murder. Peck's prescription consists of loving the 
<br>
person enough to tell him or her the truth, usually employing psychological 
<br>
techniques. Bear also alludes to the universal necessity of psychological 
<br>
help for every human being, and his heroine searches for truth, but 
<br>
Transhumanism seems to avoid objective truth. This is fatal, not only 
<br>
because science depends on assuming the existence of an objective truth, but 
<br>
also because ideas have consequences and technology amplifies them. The 
<br>
concept of transhumanism encompasses both eye-opening ideas and mind-blowing 
<br>
technology. In Terminator 2, the T-800 tells John Conner, &quot;You have in you 
<br>
the power to destroy yourselves.&quot; But by the end of the movie, the T-800 
<br>
learns the value of human life. The question is, when humans have such 
<br>
difficulty remembering it, how will the Transhumans learn it?
<br>
<p>More insistently than any other issue, Transhumanism challenges our notion 
<br>
of what it means to be human. But we must answer another question: &quot;Is 
<br>
Transhumanism good?&quot;
