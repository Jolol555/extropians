<em>&gt;    &quot;This is what is called personal liberty, and is given him by

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. &quot;because necessary for his own sustenance&quot;.  Now Jefferson
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    knew well the Romans and the Greeks, and saw himself what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    was working and not working in Europe and the colonies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    But what did he know of three thousand years of Egyptian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    history, or almost that much of Chinese history?  He would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    have refrained from using such a phrase had he known!
</em><br>
<p>Your comment makes no sense to me whatsoever. Our personal liberty,
<br>
i.e., our right to move our bodies as we please so far as we do not
<br>
infringe on the equal rights of others, *is* &quot;necessary for our own
<br>
sustenance.&quot; Without that liberty one could not so much as chew and
<br>
swallow one's food, to say nothing of such things as working (as a slave
<br>
or as a freeperson), and this was as true in ancient Egypt and China as
<br>
it was in 18th century America. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 2. The &quot;Author&quot; of nature?  Are you indeed a Believer?  Few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    indeed have survived the hammer blows of Marx, Darwin, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Freud.  Now materialism reigns supreme, and even theists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    avoid such language today.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;Author of nature&quot; might just as well be a mathematical formula so
<br>
far as TJ and other deists were concerned. He was merely pointing out
<br>
that his observation should be seen as an objective truth of nature,
<br>
which it is.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;Under the law of nature, all men are born free, every one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    comes into the world with a right to his own person, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    includes the liberty of moving and using it at his own will.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is patently false that humans are born free or with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to his or her own person.  
</em><br>
