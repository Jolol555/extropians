<em>&gt; 'NATURE' REBUKES DANISH COMITTEES ON SCIENTIFIC DISHONESTY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From Nature, 16 January, 2003, page 195
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;More heat, less light on Lomborg&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A Danish committee has picked an appropriate target and misfired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not surprisingly, last week's ruling by the Danish Committees on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) that Bjørn Lomborg, in his controversial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book The Skeptical Environmentalist, selected data in a &quot;severely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biased&quot; manner and exhibited poor scientific practice (see page 201)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; received widespread international media coverage. But whether the DCSD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerged with credit also deserves reflection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lomborg's hypothesis that warnings issued by environmentalists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists are unwarranted, presented in the book rather than in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer-reviewed literature, has been widely criticized by researchers. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is the DCSD's authority to tackle what many consider a polemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than scientific book?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The DCSD was the first European body to be set up - by the Danish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Research Agency - to examine issues of scientific misconduct, and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still unusual in being mandated to consider any complaint about any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist, or any scientific work, emerging from both the private and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public sectors. A look at its guiding principles (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.forsk.dk/eng/index.htm">http://www.forsk.dk/eng/index.htm</a>) and its judgement (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.forsk.dk/uvvu/nyt/udtaldebat/bl_decision.htm">http://www.forsk.dk/uvvu/nyt/udtaldebat/bl_decision.htm</a>) confirms that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the DCSD has the freedom to assess the case because, arguably, Lomborg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented himself as an academic and his book as a scientific argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Appropriately enough, the DCSD emphasizes that it is assessing Lomborg's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific standards, not his conclusions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The national context of this independent assessment is relevant here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lomborg was made director of the politically influential Danish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Environmental Assessment Institute, founded by the new right-wing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government after the 2001 elections, solely on the strength of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to its own statutes, the institute must be headed by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist of appropriate research experience, whereas Lomborg has little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lomborg's claims in his book are certainly significant and potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influential. The Danish public, at least, has the right to know whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he is arguing on scientifically rigorous grounds, not least given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence of his position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, the DCSD has left itself in a weak position. It did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conduct an independent analysis of the book but relied on published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticisms, especially a controversial selection published by Scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American. Even to call this judgement's basis a 'meta-analysis' would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too generous: there is, for example, no justification given for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular selection of published critiques. Furthermore, through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tangled combination of translation and legalese, the committee's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement characterizes Lomborg as &quot;objectively dishonest&quot; while at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time stating that they have no evidence for what most people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call dishonesty: deliberate misrepresentation. That subtle, not to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortuous, distinction has been lost in the media coverage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There remains a need for rigorous scrutiny of Lomborg's methods, given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his prominence, his claims to serious analysis, and the polarized debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounding his book. But this episode leaves everyone little wiser, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the waters surrounding Lomborg even muddier.
