Yup. WTC 9/11 could have happened in the 1970s. We've been on borrowed time.
<br>
<p>We(the world population)'re stuck playing Texas Hold'Em (no limit)--the
<br>
high rollers are all leg-ironed to the table. Remember the definition of
<br>
diplomacy as &quot;the art of saying 'nice doggy' until you find a big enough
<br>
rock&quot;? Here's hoping the arm and eye are adequately true.
<br>
<p>Probably, it doesn't profit the US to telegraph any real plan for energy
<br>
independence. But saying that might be me whistling past (or into) the
<br>
graveyard.
<br>
<p>The heuristics continue to seem to be:
<br>
<p>&quot;Stuff rolls downhill--but it probably won't hit bottom on _my_ watch.&quot;
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>&quot;*I'm* the bull goose loony around here!&quot; (--adapted from Kesey's _One
<br>
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_)

<p>D. Broderick asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Did the attack on the WTC scare your nation so badly?
<br>
Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, but probably not enought to take the devil by the horn(s).
<br>
To prosecute this war one needs to identify the prime enemy, which
<br>
happens to be militant Islam. The president, and all current presidents
<br>
are in the habit of kissing Wahabbi ass, to an incendiary degree. The
<br>
deaths of 3000 Americans on 9-11 was not too dear a price to pay for
<br>
saudi petroleum. Alas.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Meanwhile, US citizens are slowly being leached of their traditional
<br>
liberties. How can free people allow this to happen?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We're being slowly leeched because of the lack of political will, to
<br>
force the conflict onto Islamic lands, where the issue originates. I
<br>
note with glee, that France inexorably Islamist policies have not
<br>
blunted attacks against the French, or their oil tankers :-)
<br>
<p>Consider that the next surprise attack of consequence, may indeed be an
<br>
enhanced fission weapon, sold by Kim Jong IL of North Korea, to Al Qeida
<br>
and its Wahabbi funders (not just Saudis), and detonated in the
<br>
docksides of San Diego, or near Los Angeles, or  San Francisco. Kim, of
<br>
course, may be retaliated against, but if Washington, DC is targeted,
<br>
then whence cometh the order to strike back? What if Kim denies having
<br>
anything to do with such a strike, and what if he is correct?
<br>
<p>I would direct all interested parties to this Philadelphia Inquirer
<br>
article about theorist, Peter Gale, for elucidation on the threat of
<br>
Islamic terror. Thoughtfully cache'd by myself for your convenience.

<p>&lt;snippage of content&gt;
<br>
<p>I once stated that when the war comes to the Aussie mainland, many
<br>
Australians will first blame America for getting it involved on the war
<br>
on terror, and thus making Australia a victim of Islamic &quot;rage.&quot;  I,
<br>
indeed, encountered this, right after the Bali attack, in a Yahoo chat.
<br>
<p>The threats need to be moved back to Islamic lands where the problem
<br>
originates. Because they can't play well with others, or can't adapt to
<br>
modernism very well is nobodies fault.   But the threat is serious and
<br>
the aggression, needs to be dealt with seriously.  If W wants to
<br>
undermine Iraq as a first step to easing reliance on the House of Ibn
<br>
Saud, this is not an issue for me.
<br>
<p>Finally, we do need to work on an energy policy, that does not include
<br>
petroleum from Islamist states.
