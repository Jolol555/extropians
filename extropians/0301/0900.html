<em>&gt; We are having a serious discussion of issues.  Do you suppose you
</em><br>

these
<br>
<em>&gt; pages yesterday on that very issue.  In addition may I point out the

against
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Ron,
<br>
<p>One of the wonderful things about living in a democracy such as the United
<br>
States is that (for the while, anyway) anyone can say anything one wants to
<br>
about the President.  And, since you brought up the subject of attack, who's
<br>
really attacking whom?
<br>
<p>Maybe John le Carre has not been &quot;answered brilliantly&quot; (and is therefore
<br>
unenlightened), but here are his thoughts about the issue you've been
<br>
discussing:
<br>
<p>&quot;Back Out in the Cold
<br>
John le Carre, author of spy thrillers like The Spy Who Came In From the
<br>
Cold, says the US is going into &quot;one of its periods of historical madness,&quot;
<br>
but, he says, &quot;this is the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism,
<br>
worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous
<br>
than the Vietnam War.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is all Osama bin Laden's dream come true, says le Carre. &quot;Without bin
<br>
Laden, the Bush junta would still be trying to explain such tricky matters
<br>
as how it came to be elected in the first place; Enron; its shameless
<br>
favouring of the already-too-rich; its reckless disregard for the world's
<br>
poor, the ecology and a raft of unilaterally abrogated international
<br>
treaties. They might also have to be telling us why they support Israel in
<br>
its continuing disregard for UN resolutions. But bin Laden conveniently
<br>
swept all that under the carpet. The Bushies are riding high.&quot;
