Anders Sandberg sez:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An intresting issue here is that the committee seems to regard having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective agenda contrary to good science, even in the case of a debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book. Essentially they seem to say that researchers should only deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with objective stuff, and leave the debate about the meaning or how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be interpreted to other people. While this is reasonable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific publications it also puts a gag on scientists as participants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the public debate. If it is considered bad professional practice for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me to strongly outline my vision of how the world works and how it ought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be changed in public debate then my freedom of speech is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dampened. I can still speak, but will know my statements may hurt my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional career even when it is unrelated - the same kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chilling effect that the DMCA has on other kinds of free speech.
</em><br>
<p>My legal pal sez back:
<br>
<p>&lt; This is absolutely correct of course, and it was my first thought about
<br>
the
<br>
whole thing. But he also seems to have listed the book - or a portion of
<br>
it - as a scientific publication with his institution.
<br>
<p>Part of the problem, I suspect, is the undervaluing in academia of the work
<br>
of public intellectuals, which gets short shrift for getting &quot;points&quot; for
<br>
one's department etc. Only formal publications in one's field, preferably
<br>
refereed journal articles, count.
<br>
<p>Thus we see Lomborg trying to give the material academic respectability as a
<br>
scientific publication in the strict sense, which brings it into an area
<br>
that does, in fact, constrain his freedom of speech.
<br>
<p>If he had written the book as a philosopher rather than as a statistician
<br>
(and hence a scientist, of a kind) the committees would have had no
<br>
jurisdiction. Even as it is, they leave open the possibility that they don't
<br>
have jurisdiction. &gt;
