<p>&lt;&lt;The Americans will win by staying home.

'No' to going it alone
<br>
January 18 2003
<br>
By Annabel Crabb
<br>
Canberra
<br>
<p>Only 6 per cent of Australians are prepared to send Australian troops to war
<br>
against Iraq without United Nations backing, an exclusive national Age poll
<br>
has found.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This is akin to saying, that we would've won WW2 by staying home from 
<br>
Munich-which by the way, America did. Not that it was invited by Herr Adolph 
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>This war (allow me to kibbutz for W Bush) is not merely against Saddam, but 
<br>
against all Islamist regimes whom support Jihadi terror. One way of bashing 
<br>
the Wahabbis is by denying them oil revenue. Less oil revenue, less cash-o-la 
<br>
for madrassahs, and mosques which indoctrinate youth into become human 
<br>
bombs-insh Allah!  Notice this entails overthrowing Saddam, in order to cut 
<br>
into Saudi revenue.
<br>
<p>Being imperialistic for a while and bossing these middle eastern loons around 
<br>
is a fair enough method for regime change. Think of it as an opportunity for 
<br>
the more moderate types to have a go at running things in Islam-land. Kind of 
<br>
like giving the mammals a chance after the dinosaurs kissed the sky. The 
<br>
hornets nest of Islam has already been stirred by &quot;modernism&quot; and by the Arab 
<br>
nation, bumping up against technically advanced, non-Muslim states. By 
<br>
ridding Saddam, we can psychologically pressure the rest of them into 
<br>
adherency to non-jihadi behavior.
<br>
<p>And yes, Dr. D. I understand Australia's relectance in making life more 
<br>
complicated, and such. Things again will crytstalize, when it happens to 
<br>
Aussie. This seems to be part of the human condition, alas.
