<p><em>&gt; Being from a penny-pinching political tradition myself,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>On a local scale, yes.  This is comparable to a big corporation
<br>
maintaining a manufacturing plant.  It provides some jobs directly
<br>
and more so indirectly because of contractors, suppliers, etc.  Add
<br>
to this the fact that military bases are usually located in undeveloped
<br>
areas with little industry.  Soldiers occasionally leave their base
<br>
and spend some money, and there may be off-base housing.  It can
<br>
provide quite an economic stimulus to a poor rural area.
<br>
<p>When the French and British forces left Germany and the American
<br>
ones were scaled back substantially, there were some long faces on
<br>
the county level.  This doesn't make a blip in the overall economy,
<br>
but it can be quite noticeable locally.  The same applies to native
<br>
military facilities too, of course.  Just watch the reaction in the
<br>
USA when a military installation is closed there.
<br>
<p>In fact the papers around here--Ramstein Air Base is some 70km
<br>
off--complain that with the looming or at least perceived threat
<br>
of terrorism, the American forces are conspicuously laying off
<br>
German civilian employees and replacing them with Americans.
<br>
(This speaks volumes about the relationship of the US military to
<br>
the local population.  The terms &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;friendship&quot;, so
<br>
frequently employed on the political level, don't feature too highly,
<br>
I guess.  Back when I was listening to AFN, it displayed a sort of
<br>
siege mentality, too.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; why do the Europeans permit American bases there?
</em><br>
<p>Treaties, NATO, long-term leases, ongoing expression of goodwill,
<br>
no pressing reason to get rid of them.  Given the current political
<br>
climate, they aren't exactly a threat.
