<p>
I think a Wiki for Extropian topics would be a great idea!
<br>
<p>The one for SL4 has only been up a couple weeks and it's already showing
<br>
great promise.
<br>
<p>It does not replace the need for the mailing list though, but once a
<br>
topics been thoroughly hashed out on the list it could show up in the
<br>
Wiki as a page or pages.
