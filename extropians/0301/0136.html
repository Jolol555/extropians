<em>&gt; &gt; I've read the piece Damien refers too as well.  Lyle Burkhead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; looks to me like the sort of guy you might need to be careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where you were seen (or more likely overheard talking with)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's right.  Guilt by association is alive and well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but on the whole based only on his writing he comes across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to me as a likeable and intelligent guy wrestling as many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent folk do with ways to make progress and to improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his own and the &quot;human condition&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing, of course, is wrong with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can imagine his sort easily beneath the... broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; umbrella of transhumanism I'd approve of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you approving of the notion that someone with such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radical ideas be allowed to be called a transhumanist?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps more precisely I'm saying if he wants to call himself
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a transhumanist, when in his case, its not ignorance of the meaning
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of what transhumanist can legitimately be taken to mean, then I 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be reluctant to disagree with him and want to &quot;throw&quot; him
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'out of the club' but I would want it to be clear that he doesn't 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak for all transhumanists and he doesn't speak for me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, I agree.  Do you agree with him or approve of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his viewpoints?  I don't.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His viewpoints were changing, and he was willing to make up
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mind for himself about controversial topics. Of that I approve.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think its healthy for everyone to examine prejudice once in a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while even prejudice against prejudice. If one cannot put oneself in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shoes of a racist or a sexist or a bad guy for a while one can't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand them and deal with them effectively. And if one can't do 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that one can't take face down their behaviours and actions in the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meme-wars and beat them. I think there is a process of &quot;growing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up&quot; we all need to go through. If we don't explore some of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darker sides of human nature and human history we can't 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand them and can't deal with them.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I warm to the humanity in the guy, and my knowledge of him is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;limited to that which Damien made available in his post. If you 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are asking me whether right now he and I are in agreement in our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world views - I don't know but I seriously doubt it.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have to say yes or no as to whether I agree with him or not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then reluctantly (because it is a crude answer- I'd say I don't).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'd be reluctant to say I agree with the views of any person
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on an all or nothing basis, precisely because most of us are in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the process of forming and refining our views.. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I still think it's legitimate to consider differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between groups and races.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you believe is illegitimate to consider?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't think of anything offhand. But considering and talking
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about may be too different things. One does need to be aware 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that others can be influenced by what one says and does
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I am growing up and incomplete so too are many of my 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contemporaries. I don't mean this is a negative way but it is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good form in my view to deliberately &quot;frighten the horses or the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As it happens its not my area of interest but it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; invalid per se, or so far as I can see anti-transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; per se to question whether there are racial differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that are significant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, invalidity is another matter altogether!  Many will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably claim that supposing that there are racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences is as invalid as supposing that the sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes around the Earth.  They are perfectly entitled to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their opinion.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This swings on the definition of &quot;racial differences&quot;. I talk a bit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;more about &quot;racial stuff&quot; in the parallel thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also I'm not sure I'd want to be connected to a belief system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either, I like Max More's approach to belief systems, as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand it.  Beliefs are too [sic] be avoided if possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and minimised when not - hence PCR. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that it's a weird misuse of language to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose that beliefs should be avoided.  Just what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are you trying to say?  (I too, am a big fan of PCR,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as are many Extropians.)
</em><br>
<p>This is a good question Lee. But I'm pressed for time. 
<br>
(A friend just rang me for a hit of tennis and its a great
<br>
day outside here). Let me come back to it. I will. I promise :-) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...I can empathise both with those who are concerned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not to [harm] a good &quot;brand&quot; like ExI, and yet I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worry that if criticism, even constructive criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is limited only to those minor matters that even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; casual reader of the list would not find challenging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then the health and vibrancy may not be able to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; achieved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, quite well put.  The best extropian thinkers have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the outset endorsed this view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...not all newbies to extropian thought will be intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lightweights and if the material content gets too low or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sanitised these folk may actually be discouraged rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than encouraged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite right!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ... the fact remains there are strong forces in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; community acting against the memes and objects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropians and we need robust forums to counter those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forces and marshal pro-active extropic responses of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our own.  If this list goes too far down the path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of being a place for casually interested potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropes to sample the fare without being put off,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it may become less of a forum of interest to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropians willing and able to marshal &quot;political&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action however gently that word is interpreted. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that this has already occurred.  I already know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of conversations about extropian topics that have had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be taken off line because of the &quot;image&quot; it was felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to show the world.
</em><br>
<p>Without knowing the background I for one would not
<br>
presume to say that that was the wrong decision.
<br>
<p>I would say though that to the extent it is possible to 
<br>
attract and maintain the interest of serious free thinkers
<br>
the forum becomes vibrant robust and healthy. Keeping
<br>
up the critical mass is important as so often the deeper
<br>
thinkers grow through the stage where lists can actually
<br>
satisfy them. They weary of the repetition. Their input is
<br>
invaluable but there time is theirs and they come to 
<br>
choose to allocate it as the precious thing it it. 
<br>
<p>I think it is incumbent upon all of us who wish to see
<br>
extropic memes propagated not to trivially or recklessly
<br>
poop in the communal pool.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Brett
