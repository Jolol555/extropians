<p>&lt;&lt;Are You Better Safe Than Sorry?   
<br>
<p><p>by Hans Labohm [ 01/17/2003 ] 
<br>
<p>'Better safe than sorry.' This is the crux of the precautionary principle. 
<br>
The application of the principle manifests itself everywhere. There are crash 
<br>
barriers along the highway and handrails along the staircase. 
<br>
<p>But the ladder of the traditional window cleaner does not have a handrail. 
<br>
And the same is true for the ladders in sluices, which may give rise to 
<br>
hair-raising spectacles of a passing skipper using the ladder to take out his 
<br>
St. Bernard dog. We do take part in traffic, although it may cost human 
<br>
lives. We finance the fire brigade via our taxes, but not every house has a 
<br>
sprinkler installation. And at the apogee of the Cold War, there were even 
<br>
people who did not possess a nuclear free shelter in their backyard. 
<br>
<p>In other words, a risk-free world is unthinkable and there are limits to the 
<br>
application of the precautionary principle. We believe that some risks are 
<br>
too small to warrant additional expenditure. If we would spend more on them, 
<br>
then we will have to forgo the satisfaction of other needs, including the 
<br>
precautionary measures that will protect us against other risks that we 
<br>
believe to be more likely. In short, the application of the precautionary 
<br>
principle should be subject to the same simple cost-benefit analysis, which 
<br>
we also apply in all other fields of human decision-making. 
<br>
<p>Stagnation 
<br>
<p>Over the last decade or so, the precautionary principle has been given more 
<br>
priority than before, especially in Europe. Even to the extent that The 
<br>
European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Affairs, David Byrne, has 
<br>
reluctantly raised the question whether Europe wasn't exaggerating a little 
<br>
bit and had perhaps fallen victim to a certain degree of risk paranoia. But 
<br>
his attempts to do something about it in order to remedy what he has called 
<br>
the European 'GMO-psychosis' (GMO = genetically modified organisms), have 
<br>
mainly faltered so far. 
<br>
<p>Also his colleague for trade, Pascal Lamy, is troubled by this phenomenon, 
<br>
particularly because there exist important differences in risk appreciation 
<br>
between the US and the EU. These give rise to trade tensions, for instance as 
<br>
regards the use of growth hormones for meat and the use of GMOs in vegetable 
<br>
food production. &gt;&gt;
