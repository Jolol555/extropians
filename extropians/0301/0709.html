<em>&gt; Actually I find the hording of information by the super powers and thier

<em>&gt; What possible disadvantages could there be by allowing non-fiction books

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me but this is quite ridiculous in the current economic 
<br>
context. Until/unless people do not need to &quot;work for a living&quot; 
<br>
claims that creating non-fiction or anything else that requires 
<br>
actual labor, creativity and dedication should be uncompensated 
<br>
are actually claims that the efforts of some should be ripped 
<br>
off by you on terms that you arbitrarily decide regardless of 
<br>
their wishes.  It is a claim of the right to steal the time and 
<br>
efforts of others outright.  In other words, it is a claim to 
<br>
the right to be a parasite on the lives of others.
<br>
<p>That said, I believe that most ideas/information would much more 
<br>
ideally be part of an intellectual commons.  However, to get 
<br>
there we *must* insure that the creators, organizers, inventors, 
<br>
compilers of this information are compensated reasonably. 
<br>
Personally I believe it is possible that we may someday get to a 
<br>
more or less &quot;cashless&quot; non-competitive (abundance) for most 
<br>
things kind of economy.  But we are not there yet.  Claims in 
<br>
the meantime that the purveyors of certain types of benefits 
<br>
should simply starve or do it as an avocation and especially 
<br>
that you should force them to or act as if what is not so is so 
<br>
are morally bankrupt.
