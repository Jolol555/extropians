<p>&quot;We pulled out of a senseless war.  Our handling of that war had more than a
<br>
little to do with the final outcome.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, the fact that we cut off aid to Indochina at a time when the Soviets were
<br>
substantially increasing aid to the North Vietnamese played the decisive role
<br>
in the outcome of the war. But perhaps you would like to elaborate on your
<br>
point of view here.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The US had no legitimate business in Vietnam to start with.&quot;
<br>
<p>But according to you, they did. You said earlier that &quot;I consider war
<br>
honorable to stop a major and highly expansionist evil such as Hitler.&quot;
<br>
<p>Our efforts in Vietnam, like in Korea, Afghanistan, Greece, and a host
<br>
of other theatres were to stop the spread of Soviet expansionism and
<br>
influence. The Soviets were without question the biggest winners of
<br>
the Vietnam War, as their chief rival was humiliated and temporarily
<br>
incapacitated, in addition to the fact that they were able to construct their
<br>
largest military installation outside of the USSR in Cam Rahn Bay in what had
<br>
been South Vietnam. If going to war to stop Hitler was the proper course, then
<br>
surely attempting to curb the activities of a regime which controlled more
<br>
territory and killed more people was also justified.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Our actions there , including our illegal actions in neighboring countries
<br>
gave fuel to Pol Pot.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, I'm not really sure what you mean by &quot;fuel&quot;, but how about the WEAPONS
<br>
AND TRAINING that the North Vietnamese gave Pol Pot? Whatever propaganda
<br>
victories Pol Pot was able to gain as a result of the US bombing campaign
<br>
pales in comparison to the vital support he received in terms of supplies from
<br>
the Communists. And, as David Chandler in his biography on Pol Pot pointed out
<br>
(and others have done in other books), THE NORTH VIETNAMESE CREATED THE KHMER
<br>
ROUGE. If you want to blame someone for the destruction of Cambodia, look at
<br>
Hanoi, not Washington.
<br>
<p>&quot;The rest of your laundry list in no way                                      
<br>
justified what we did there or that we were there at all.  I do               
<br>
not see how anyone could judge the reasons and consequences to                
<br>
this country (US) as anything other than senseless.&quot;                          
<br>
<p>You don't find our actions to stop Hitler senseless. I doubt the people of
<br>
France do either. I find it hard to believe that the South Koreans would
<br>
consider our actions of 1950 senseless. If these actions were all justified,
<br>
then so too was our involvement in Vietnam. Our failure to stop the Communists
<br>
there does not diminish the nobility of the effort.
<br>
<p>&quot;Puhleeze, we are not going in there for the sake of the Iraqi                
<br>
people.  Pretense that we are is sickening.&quot;                                  
<br>
<p>So what? We didn't send troops or aid into Korea, Afghanistan, Greece,
<br>
or Europe during World War II because we were being altruistic. All of
<br>
these actions were in the best interests of the United States first and
<br>
foremost. Yet, all of the above parties benefited from our actions. Are the
<br>
improvements in the quality of life that these people enjoy somehow diminished
<br>
because our first concern was not their well being?
