<p><em>&gt; the whole point of Sowell's &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had to consult lately, is that deciding the *level* at which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different decisions occur is crucial to society's well-being.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good general point Lee (hence my forking the thread).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why not leave all these decisions to the people most closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affected?  They have the knowledge of their particular situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspirations!  Is it because we feel that they may make a mistake?
</em><br>
<p>I wonder if it is even a practical or useful question to ask
<br>
&quot;why not leave all these decisions to the people most closely
<br>
&nbsp;affected?&quot;
<br>
<p>Who actually has the power now, in your view, to *actually*
<br>
decide who gets to make these decisions in society? 
<br>
<p>Do you think that legislators decide - note that tend to vote 
<br>
bills into laws in bunches not simply on their lonesome ?  
<br>
<p>Do you think that citizens in democracies decide and if so
<br>
how? Merely through voting or are other avenues open?
<br>
<p>Do you think that politcal activists or the media or media owners
<br>
decide?
<br>
<p>Where, in your view, in the contemporary world, does the power
<br>
to decide &quot;who decides&quot; actually reside? 
<br>
<p>You might pick just the US to simplify if you want.
<br>
