<em>&gt; &quot;I think we are more noble as Americans when we take our heritage
</em><br>
seriously
<br>
<em>&gt; enough to avoid entanglements all over the globe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaged in for highly questionable reasons and at very high costs at all
</em><br>

</em><br>
time.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, thanks for your comments.  I can only ask what would you
</em><br>
consider
<br>
<em>&gt; those 'very clear' circumstances to be?  As free people, do we not value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom, and in doing so, wish freedom upon others? 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Wishing freedom for others sure.  But freedom for others, even preserving
<br>
freedom for oneself, is not consistent we attempting 
<br>
to establish it or abolish non-freedom all over the globe by force.&quot;
<br>
<p>In some cases there may be no other way to bring freedom to others except by
<br>
forcibly destroying the corrupt dictators that oppress and enslave them.
<br>
The fact that you think there are still other options to accomplish this in
<br>
IRAQ is just a point we disagree on,  all the conventional diplomatic
<br>
options have been exhausted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As extropians, I should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope that we prefer all humans, regardless of ethnicity, geography, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology live under a system which grants them basic constitutional
</em><br>
rights.
<br>
<em>&gt; By being 'anti-war' with regard to IRAQ, you are necessarily 'pro corrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous despotic dictator'  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;That does not in the least follow.  It is built on the presumption that war
<br>
against Iraq will bring freedom to the Iraqi people.&quot;
<br>
<p>Do you think instead it will place them under a worse and more oppressive
<br>
regime?
<br>
<p>&quot;It is also built on the notion that our desire to attack is somehow at
<br>
least in part altruistic concern for the Iraqi people.&quot;
<br>
<p>No its not, but it is an added, positive, extropic benefit that in securing
<br>
our own future existence and peace as a pro-freedom, democratic constitional
<br>
nation we will be simaltanously riding the world of a meglomaniacal murderer
<br>
and freeing the people held under his guns and whips.  Does our sole
<br>
intention HAVE to be an altruistic concern for the Iraqi people to make this
<br>
effort Valid?  By that reasoning, the only way this can be valid is if, not
<br>
only do we not gain anything from overthorwing sadam, but we should in
<br>
effect come out worse then we went in.  'Altruism' is a destructive and
<br>
counterproductive meme, it requires self-sacrifice for the good of others.
<br>
Progress in not a zero sum proposition, we (both the US, and the people of
<br>
IRAQ) can come out of this situtation better than they entered it.
<br>
<p>&quot;Both are extremely questionable.  Being aginst this war certainly does not
<br>
mean I am pro Saddam.  This is false dichotomy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then what do you propose be done about Saddam?  While you are thinking about
<br>
it, he is attempting to acquire WMD, it a murderous racist dictators, and as
<br>
such controls the second largest cheap abundant energy supply in the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What of the IRAQ government, and Suddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner of oppression, do you find morally defensible?  Since a state is
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt; a collection of individuals, the only moral states are ones that exist as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extensions of individuals, IRAQ is no such state, it is built on murder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppression, corruption, and deceit.  Given this, I do not understand your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that we have 'no business' going there as 'free people'? Should we
</em><br>
get
<br>
<em>&gt; in the habit of just not caring about people unless they are Americans?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The rest of the above argument is based on a false dichotomy and thus is
<br>
pointless rhetoric.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would hardly consider the moral validity of statehood as 'pointless
<br>
rhetoric'  Are you a moral relativist?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       Emancipation was not delivered by cousin Abe with his Emancipation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Proclamation but by my great great uncle (and thousands of others) lying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in the military graveyard in Nashville, Tennessee (and other places).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So all you understand and consider honorable is war, might, death and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction?  If so, then I pity you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War committed in an effort to free people and dispose of murderous
</em><br>
dictators
<br>
<em>&gt; is both 'honorable' and more importantly morally justified.  Do you
</em><br>
consider
<br>
<em>&gt; 'war' to never be honorable under ANY circumstances?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The people of Iraq did not ask for any such intervention.  Nor are we
<br>
obligated to do such if they did.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nor do they need to 'ask' for the action to be morally valid, as I said
<br>
above, Saddam as a dictator has no 'right' to be a dicatotor, and thusly the
<br>
nation of IRAQ has no 'right' to exist, as it does not even recognize the
<br>
rights of its individuals.  
<br>
<p>&quot;And such an argument is not in the least the primary argument that is
<br>
driving us toward war.&quot;
<br>
<p>See Above
<br>
<p>&quot;I consider war honorable to stop a major and highly expansionist evil such
<br>
as Hitler.  Although it would have been far cheaper and more moral to have
<br>
stopped him by more peaceful means much earlier.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet 'peaceniks' and 'anti war' individuals were isolationist at the time. I
<br>
also do not comprehend why you found it honorable to stop Hitler as a mass
<br>
murderer yet did not find it honorable to stop communism as a highly
<br>
expansionist evil that had slaughtered millions in the case of the vietnam
<br>
war.  Is Communism ok, but Hitler is evil?  What has killed more people, and
<br>
thus which is more extropic?
<br>
<p>&quot;Despite a lot of rhetoric, Saddam is simply not in that class.  I consider
<br>
war moral to defends one's home and country.  But Saddam is at worse a very
<br>
small threat to us.&quot;
<br>
<p>A threat he is, nevertheless, and I am sure the oppressed IRAQI people
<br>
consider him more than a 'small threat' as well, but I guess that doesn't
<br>
matter to you, since you don't live there, right?
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't consider war justified to preemptively destroy any possible threat
<br>
to us anywhere and everywhere in the world regardless of national borders
<br>
and sovereignity.  &quot;
<br>
<p>Nor do I consider war justified in every case, but in this case, it clearly
<br>
is.  As Saddam is a murderous tyrannical dictator, is racist, hates the
<br>
west, which stands for freedom, scientific progress, and capitalism,
<br>
controls the worlds second largest supply of cheap abundant energy, and
<br>
funds terrorist groups and organizations.  What part of this isnt justified?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;What is this &quot;we&quot;?  You will sit this one out due to age and cheer other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;boys&quot; on to their death in a more senseless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict than even Vietnam was.  Bully for you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the events that transpired in Indochina after the peace and anti war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocates 'won' and forced the US to abandon Indochina to the corrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despotic murderous regimes of Mao, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Min and the Soviet
</em><br>
Union,
<br>
<em>&gt; and the resultant millions who were murdered or killed, I do not
</em><br>
understand
<br>
<em>&gt; how one can consider the Vietnam war 'senseless'.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;We pulled out of a senseless war.  Our handling of that war had more than a
<br>
little to do with the final outcome.  The US had no legitimate business in
<br>
Vietnam to start with.  Our actions there , including our illegal actions in
<br>
neighboring countries gave fuel to Pol Pot.  The rest of your laundry list
<br>
in no way justified what we did there or that we were there at all.  &quot;
<br>
<p>I find it hard to believe that in one sentence you say &quot;&quot;I consider war
<br>
honorable to stop a major and highly expansionist evil such as Hitler&quot; and
<br>
no more than a few paragraphs later you say we had no business being in
<br>
veitnam?  Never mind the fact that we were fighting a murderous expansionist
<br>
regime, but South Vietnam requested our help and assistance.  So what part
<br>
of this made our present 'illigitimate' exactly?  
<br>
<p>&quot;I do not see how anyone could judge the reasons and consequences to this
<br>
country (US) as anything other than senseless.&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not see how anyone with reasonable knowledge of the events of communism
<br>
and indochina could consider our presence and effort in vietnam anything but
<br>
moral.  Again I ask you to compare and contrast the vietnam war and the
<br>
korean war, I would like to hear what you have to say about it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps what was 'senseless' about it was that, in addition to many poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military decisions and political decisions, was that we gave up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abandoned those people to collectivization and labor camps.  I hope that
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; same thing does not happen here, and that we do not abandon the IRAQI
</em><br>
people
<br>
<em>&gt; to the hands of a murderous meglomoniacal dictator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Puhleeze, we are not going in there for the sake of the Iraqi people.
<br>
Pretense that we are is sickening.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is no pretense, it is an added benefit.  I can only draw the conclusion
<br>
from statements such as this that you feel the only moral actions are
<br>
altruistic ones.  Is that the case?  If that is the case please sacrifice
<br>
your life and give me all your money.  It is clear that both we (The US and
<br>
the post industrialized west) will be far better off without Sadam in power
<br>
of IRAQ, simaltaneously the people of IRAQ will also be far better off.  Do
<br>
you not agree that the people of IRAQ would be far better off under a
<br>
democratic constitutional republic than under Saddam?
