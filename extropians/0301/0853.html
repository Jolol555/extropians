Subject: RE: free information

<p><p><em>&gt; Who is essential in the publication loop, I wonder? A good author could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist solely by word of mouth, or by 'whoever bought this also bought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these&quot; lists. If you need an editor or a sales agency you could pay them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in front, or make them get a cut on the issues sold (probably, more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewarding).
</em><br>
<p>Who is essential in the production loop under web-based downloadable
<br>
digital paperbooks? [I can just see people exceeding their download limits
<br>
on cable by being addicted to downloading large format photography.]
<br>
<p>Well, the author. Editors will be a matter of choice, but will still exist in larger
<br>
organizations. Probably there will be more &quot;fast and good&quot; editors (currently
<br>
we have endured a generation of more-work-means-my-job-is-valid editors 
<br>
combined with trying to upgrade sloppy politically fashionable work - and
<br>
these editors took over when the older generation was fired by the new
<br>
world of superlarge publishing houses created by ceaseless merging and 
<br>
takeover, itself driven by cost factors and limited distribution mechanisms).
<br>
<p>The website will be a matter of choice, since there will be private and semi
<br>
private options, but there will exist website company managers and support 
<br>
staff. Publicists and reviewers will be huge. 
<br>
<p>Bookstores and inkpaper books will still exist in boutique old-fashioned form, 
<br>
in niche newspaper cracks, and possibly in the corner of more social &quot;cruise
<br>
our hard drive library and internet catalogue&quot; bookstores.
<br>
<p>Credit card companies will benefit (until the government provides free 
<br>
digital cash as it does free plastic cash).
<br>
<p>Internet cable and service providers and computer companies will benefit 
<br>
servicing increased traffic and meeting new needs.
<br>
<p>Flat paper battery producers (currently at least one Israeli company) will benefit,
<br>
along with cheap (damn the size) chip manufacturers.
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
Who will suffer? 
<br>
<p>[This process applies first to black and white production. 
<br>
Colour production is slightly further in the future, so this represents a gradual
<br>
changeover outside of novels and newspapers - including Internet newspapers,
<br>
of course: it implies newspaper prices will go down, currently half a newsaper's
<br>
cost is paper production, maybe $US0.5million per 200,000 circulation or some-
<br>
thing like that.]
<br>
<p>Forestors.
<br>
<p>Some portion of paper production staff will be shed as the need for newspapers
<br>
and magazines will be less and digital paper will outlast books if constructed 
<br>
sturdily.
<br>
<p>Printers. These will have to downsize and fill more niche markets. Note that 
<br>
[I presume} cheap digital paper can be set in large sheets via a single chip 
<br>
and then cut up once set (saving costs for postcards etc.). Printers currently
<br>
consume about 20% of the money you pay for a book, rate depends on print
<br>
numbers. Electronic ink printing didn't dent this process much because the
<br>
distribution logjam remained in the bookstore and the printing machines were
<br>
still expensive. I.e. the benefits of discarding plates vapourized in the real world.
<br>
<p>Bookshops. Currently in real terms booshops and their landlords consume 
<br>
50 to 60% of the money you pay for a book.
<br>
<p>Agents. Publicists will subsume their role somewhat. Authors will become their
<br>
own agents somewhat. There'll still be a role for them in the upmost echelons 
<br>
of success, however.
<br>
<p>Distributors. The notion of a small clique of prosperous distributors is doomed.
<br>
<p>Middling to large publishing houses. Though big players will always exist, we
<br>
are going to see a much flatter structure here.
<br>
<p><pre>

As an aside, note there will be the phenomenon of the internet wave: instant
millionaires deriving their wealth from word of mouth on their 25cents US a click
website.
There will be public debate about whether eink and its corporate allies are too
powerful, like Windows and Bill Gates. (So far Gyricon is looking like iMac to PC).
The race to colour digital ink is the next development, along with cheap printable
circuits (eink's co-founder/researcher is now working on this).
