<p>
Here is an idea I have had, prompted in part by recent posts about parallel 
<br>
universes.
<br>
As it would seem that more scientists are buying into the idea that all 
<br>
things exist in parallel universes and this helps explain a few quirky 
<br>
happenings in the quantum world. I began thinking about experiments that have 
<br>
shown strange things happening with electrons travelling through very thin 
<br>
wires or PCB tracks. 
<br>
In cases where the wire is thin enough, the electrons sometime vanish or jump 
<br>
impossible distances to nearby wires. Thus breaking conventional laws. I am 
<br>
not sure who noticed this behaviour. Hopefully one of you will have some 
<br>
links or a better idea of exactly what happened.
<br>
Anyhoooo.
<br>
My theory is that the electrons simply take the path of least resistance, as 
<br>
per conventional law. but this path includes the jump through to and back 
<br>
from another universe. So their easiest path from wire A to wire B in our 
<br>
universe may be via point Z in a parallel universe of even several jumps 
<br>
through several universes.
<br>
I equate it to trying to walk across a city. The easiest path may not be 
<br>
straight down the road, but may be much easier if you take the subway system. 
<br>
You may be able to get a direct train or you may have to change to get to 
<br>
your destination. The end result is that you have still made an easier 
<br>
journey.
<br>
<p>The one thing that bothers me about universe jumping is the energy involved. 
<br>
I would expect the electron to need more energy to jump from A to Z to B than 
<br>
it would need for A to B. Then I though about the possible ways that the 
<br>
electron could make savings.
<br>
In the same way that the subway will get you there with less resistance from 
<br>
Traffic or street lights. It will also get you there quicker. This may be one 
<br>
way the tunnelling electron could save energy for the jump between realities. 
<br>
If the process of jumping has a time dilating effect that could have an 
<br>
impact on the energy needed for the journey. This may need some fairly hefty 
<br>
maths to prove.
<br>
It could also be true that in the alternate universe there is a wire with 
<br>
much better conductive properties than the wire we are using. This could 
<br>
provide a superconductive short circuit that the electron needs to jump from 
<br>
one wire to the other. The total cost of the route from wire A to wire B is 
<br>
less than the cost of continuing to travel along wire A as we expect it to.
<br>
<p>Does any of this make sense to anyone else? (One of my favourite sayings)
<br>
<p>The next thought to pop into my head was that if the above theory is true, 
<br>
then we must be able to use this to our advantage. In the field of 
<br>
electronics we are searching for faster, more discrete devices that will give 
<br>
us greater computational power. If all things already exist then these 
<br>
devices already exist. So can we use them? 
<br>
Well, how is this for an idea. The 'Blainey machine.' We build for example a 
<br>
microprocessor with architecture that omits the devices we really want. If we 
<br>
wanted super fast transistors, we leave them out. We still have the tracks 
<br>
that would have connected them to the rest of the processor circuit, but we 
<br>
have effectively made a non-functioning super chip. Logic says that when we 
<br>
switch it on, nothing will happen. I say that something will happen (head on 
<br>
block, get the axes ready) and that some electrons will make it through the 
<br>
chip and exhibit the characteristics that we require. My theory is that they 
<br>
will find the least expensive route through the circuit. This route will take 
<br>
them out of our universe and through others that contain less expensive 
<br>
routes. Some of these will include the super fast transistors that we need. 
<br>
<p>Now the problem is 'what percentage will go through simple superconducting 
<br>
wires and what will go through the super transistors?' 
<br>
If we build it, we will know.
<br>
<p>Another question is what percentage would jump out of our universe never to 
<br>
return because they found a cheaper or more attractive destination? 
<br>
Yikes. We should also be able to measure this. More importantly. If electrons 
<br>
can go out, we can also steal them from other universes. Think of the 
<br>
possibilities.
<br>
<p>I would love to get my hands on a scanning tunnelling microscope so that I 
<br>
could build something at atomic scale to test the theories. does anyone have 
<br>
one spare? &lt;g&gt;
<br>
I think a small Blainey machine could be built, but It would take yet more 
<br>
hefty maths and some very sound logic to plan. 
<br>
<p>The more I think about it, the more the oddities of quantum mechanics seem to 
<br>
be within reach of understanding. I think i'm still some way off though :o)   
<br>
