<p>That seems very unlikely.  If they were worried about that then 
<br>
they wouldn't have claimed bragging rights to start with.  No, 
<br>
they made a public splash and in order to derive benefits from 
<br>
it (such as new drones/members) they have to offer up evidence 
<br>
it was more than a misguided lie/publicity stunt.  The latter 
<br>
would lose potential converts and perhaps even existing members.

<em>&gt;&gt;Gulf war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ditto on rules of evidence as above. There is in fact evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concealment in that significant quantities of chemical and biotoxins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known to be in inventory in 1998 are not accounted for in Iraq's most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent Declaration to the Security Council. They have disappeared from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tally, and Iraq refuses to disclose what happened to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Where precisely did you get this information?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;It seems that a whole lot of people are getting dressed up who are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think they are not going anywhere, you are mistaken.

<p>I hope to hell they aren't going anywhere like where they think 
<br>
they are.  Any sane person would.
