<p><em>&gt; i.    Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
</em><br>
<p>All right, the picture you're painting is becoming a little clearer.
<br>
You suggest that the oil-importing company tax oil before it's
<br>
refined, on its way into the consuming country.  (Let's say that
<br>
for the sake of argument, it's refined in the destination country.)
<br>
<p>You also claim that the oil-producing countries enjoy &quot;windfall
<br>
profits&quot;.  I'll agree that Rafal's bananas weren't a very good
<br>
example, but to me, the only possibility of an &quot;undeserved&quot;, or
<br>
&quot;windfall&quot; profit is one that obtains upon collusion, i.e., not
<br>
out of the action of a free market.  Indeed, OPEC has tried to
<br>
obtain precisely these profits.  So it's unclear to me whether
<br>
or not you agree on this restricted meaning of &quot;windfall&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We know windfall profits take place just by taking a look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the money being made by the oil producing nations from oil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sales.  That money is not the result of human labour: [Labor:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brain power and or muscle power applied to some productive end.]
</em><br>
<p>It's evident that you see these profits as undeserved.  But
<br>
capitalism and free markets, of course, aren't about that at
<br>
all.  They're about sending signals:  the signal here is &quot;FIND
<br>
AND DEVELOP OIL OR CHEAP REPLACEMENTS!!&quot;.  But maximal progress
<br>
always appears to be attended by maximal freedom:  the oil
<br>
producers should have the soul motive of making as much money
<br>
as they can, up to but not including collusion.  For example,
<br>
you'll probably agree that if oil had flowed to the world from
<br>
the Middle East the way it should have, our civilization would
<br>
be much progressed from what it is now.
<br>
<p>But whatever; to understand the market mechanics, I'll continue
<br>
to follow your intriguing line of thought:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally rise.
</em><br>
<p>So, though it's not directly relevant, the whole society is placed
<br>
on a slightly slower exponential growth curve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; iii.  Alternatives to oil based products appear a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       cheaper. I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       instead of driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iv.   Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; v.    Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vi.   To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, say that the tax increases were infinitesimal, and so your
<br>
price drop here is infinitesimal (by looking at the derivatives,
<br>
we might see the cause/effect relationship more easily).  But
<br>
did you say what happened to the consuming economy?  Does (vi)
<br>
result in as much oil as used previously or not?  I guess that
<br>
either way, your point is that the oil producing countries get
<br>
less money.
<br>
<p>Now if the *level* of oil consumption returns to its previous
<br>
level, then no economic harm has been done.  Money has simply
<br>
gone out of the oil-producers' pockets into those of the taxing
<br>
government's.  But I can't quite believe that the equilibrium
<br>
would work like that---it seems to me that an almost Le Chatelier's
<br>
effect kicks in here, and less oil would be consumed.  That would
<br>
be bad, naturally.
<br>
<p>[Note for people who don't understand the first thing about
<br>
economics:  you decrease total wealth whenever you inhibit
<br>
the free flow of trade or capital.]
<br>
<p>I must stop here to avoid too long a post.
<br>
<p>Lee
