<em>&gt; &quot;So far Bush is doing a very poor job convincing anybody that he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally right in attacking Irak. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that Sadam is a murderous racist tyrant despotic dictator is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral justification enough.
</em><br>
<p>This whole thing would be far more credible, if the US had shown or would 
<br>
show real interest in the well-being of other countries. It is not very 
<br>
convincing, when someone deals with non-democratic regimes (Chile, 
<br>
Argentina, Nicaragua, Iran, Iraq) and groups like the Taliban and bin 
<br>
Ladin on the one hand, and suddenly demands to be the moral leader 
<br>
against just one other non-democratic regime, especially when exactly 
<br>
this regime had been financially supported for years.
<br>
<p>Even if Iraq has to be liberated from Saddam tyranny, that task is much 
<br>
more complicated than just a military action game. The problem will be to 
<br>
esablish a stable, democratic system, that will honor human rights. 
<br>
Unfortunately, this is an idea, which is completely new in that region 
<br>
and has no roots there. And even worse: the US has no interest in such a 
<br>
development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is NOT about 'cheap' oil so evil oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies can profit, its about getting the cheapest most plentiful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source of energy, in fact the second largest depository of it, out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hands of a murderous despotic tyrant.
</em><br>
<p>So what? What do you think can he possibly do with that oil? Does he have 
<br>
any chance to make any money with it? Could he smuggle substancial 
<br>
amounts of it out of the country? How? And who would pay for it?
<br>
<p>But you are right. This is a question of who will control that oil. And 
<br>
now take a guess. The US government pays 10-20 times its yearly amount of 
<br>
developing aid for a war against a country with the worlds second largest 
<br>
depository of the most important energy resource. It takes the risk of 
<br>
starting a wildfire of violence in that region. 
<br>
<p>Would you believe, that this regime, with &quot;US interests first&quot; as its 
<br>
prime directive, will implement a truly free and democratic political 
<br>
system in Iraq, that will use the oil resources for the benefit of the 
<br>
Iraqi people? What if the new regime in Bagdad plays well with the other 
<br>
OPEC states? What if they want higher prices than the West wants to pay? 
<br>
No, too many variables and no good excuses to come for a third time. This 
<br>
war has to make sure, that the oil resources will be available for the 
<br>
west (esp. the US) for a price as low as possible.
<br>
<p>It is therefore much more plausible for me, that the political system in 
<br>
Iraq after the next war will not be truly democratic, self-contained and 
<br>
self-confident. I therefore don't buy the &quot;war for freedom and democracy&quot; 
<br>
arguments.
