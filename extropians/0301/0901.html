<br>
<p><em>&gt; We will fire back if fired upon.  The shooter might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well fire everything he has simultaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because he gets only one chance.
</em><br>
<p>If you're talking about a massive attack by a major world power then yes we
<br>
will fire back and destroy the attacker's entire civilization as well as our
<br>
own, it's called MAD. If you're talking about an isolated attack, well
<br>
despite a massive effort not one mobile scud launcher was destroyed during
<br>
the 91 gulf war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  but the shooter gets only one shot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nuclear submarines put the AD in MAD.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand what you mean by that, submarines can launch a second
<br>
salvo, if you really have a desire to shake up the rubble. The reason one
<br>
job will always be more expensive than the other is that the offensive
<br>
target is stationary the defensive target is moving at 12,000 mph; the
<br>
offensive can be off course by many miles and still cause devastation while
<br>
the defense must be accurate within inches, if only 2% of the attacking
<br>
missiles work properly that is still more than enough to destroy a
<br>
civilization while the defensive must be virtually 100% perfect or it is not
<br>
worth doing. Because one is much more expensive than the other the attacker
<br>
can always overwhelm the defender, I wish it were otherwise but that's the
<br>
way the world is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The terrorists use a missile in the fond hope of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blaming the Russians, so that a TN shootout is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triggered.  Granted it probably wouldn't work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the US has invested in sophisiticated means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to detect the source of a missile launch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What concerns me is that Russia hasn't invested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in parallel technology, so the terrorists use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the option of dropping a nuclear missile on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moscow.  Boris doesn't know for sure who fired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, but in brutal desperation, retaliates against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New York.  Europeans are drawn into the unspeakable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horror, and two hours later most of the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population is either dead or sincerely wishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Muslim extremists see their opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleanse the sinful planet.  They cheerfully seize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this opportunity.  This nightmare scenario is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shaping military strategy.
</em><br>
<p>If I change the word &quot;missile&quot; to &quot;Federal Express package&quot; how would
<br>
anything change in your very unlikely scenario?
