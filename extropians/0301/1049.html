<p>This observation is *excellent* Dossy!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If extropians were really all about verbal volleyball and

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  And this may be a very critical distinction.  With MENSA one is
<br>
just concerned with pointing out how one is XYZZY smart (at least
<br>
to my knowledge of the organization).
<br>
<p>With ExI one is concerned with &quot;How do we go beyond that?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Be it AI, economics, biotech, law, politics, etc. -- it is always
<br>
a question of &quot;How can we push that (damn) envelope?&quot;.  The universe
<br>
is decaying all around us -- how can *I/We* turn back those tides?
<br>
(One of the interesting questions about extropianism is how many
<br>
partners does one really have...?)
<br>
<p>That (the decay pushback) is to me is what it is all about to be
<br>
an extropian.  It is not about &quot;transhumanism&quot; which while I think
<br>
is very important and valuable -- because it is about what we may
<br>
evolve into -- it is still not &quot;it&quot; for me.  At the core of my
<br>
being I reject chaos.  We have not come this far to let it all
<br>
slide back into oblivion.
<br>
<p>Extropianism (for me) is about drawing a line in the sand.  It
<br>
about looking the forces of the universe straight in the face
<br>
and saying &quot;this line ye shall not cross&quot;.  (It is also about
<br>
being pragmatic with respect to when you can make such statements
<br>
and get away with them and when they are more likely to be foolish
<br>
meanderings -- as the saying goes &quot;Discretion is the better part of
<br>
valour&quot;.
<br>
<p>But Dossy's observations raise the question of when or how are we
<br>
optimizing our &quot;pooling&quot; meme-sharing perspectives with others.
<br>
How do we create a &quot;shared/group&quot; intelligence that dares to stand
<br>
in the onslaught of the force of entropy?
<br>
<p>Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote a very beautiful song in two
<br>
variants about Maralyn Monroe and Princess Diana.  Now-a-days
<br>
I generally cry whenever I hear either of the variants of
<br>
&quot;A candle in the wind&quot; played.  The question becomes whether
<br>
there are extropians willing to be the candles?  The interesting
<br>
part is that one never knows when one steps up for the lighting
<br>
ceremony whether or not one may or may not be blown out.  The
<br>
longevity of candles is a very difficult question indeed.
