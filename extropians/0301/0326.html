<p>The desire to spend less time traveling across the countryside

and more time testing the output quality from the still.

<p><em>&gt; Human can only learn by assuming that there is a constant and observing a

</em><br>
<p>That isn't how I &quot;learn&quot;.  One &quot;learns&quot; through repetition.  One &quot;discovers&quot;
<br>
or perhaps &quot;creates&quot; through the observation of the unusual.  Very creative
<br>
people are able to imagine something in their &quot;mind's eye&quot; and then work
<br>
through (or create) a process for producing that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A society that creates the most new memes will be able to identify more

</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you get to experiment with them.  Communism would work fine if you
<br>
could use genetics to modify everyone so they all *really* had equipotential.
<br>
It doesn't work when those bright enough to realize they have more potential
<br>
than others are getting the same slice of the pie.  In that situation it is
<br>
to ones advantage to place ones efforts in creating self-political advantages
<br>
rather than technical inventions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you look at history, the societies who properties molded the most usable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative minds seem to have certain traits in common. Feel free to add or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtract from the list.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are missing something like &quot;5. a technology base for advancement&quot;.
<br>
<p>For example -- does there exist anyplace in Afghanistan (or pick another
<br>
3rd world country) the technology that would allow an inventor to &quot;tinker&quot;
<br>
with the architecture of an internal combustion engine?  Can you bore out
<br>
a cylinder?  Can you change the timing on a camshaft?  What about creating
<br>
a Bose-Einstein condensate where you need milli-kelvin refrigeration
<br>
capabilities?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1.	High Encouragement of Individuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.	Little Social Exclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.	Shared Social Value Complexes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4.	Almost No limits of Information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Speaking psychologically do these have an impact on creative thought? Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number 4 by itself cause creative thought?
</em><br>
<p>I've seen arguments that &quot;social exclusion&quot; (!#2) might actually drive creativity.
<br>
I can cite a very specific example in my life where I changed a &quot;reality&quot;
<br>
that could *not* be changed which directly involved social exclusion.
<br>
As the saying goes -- necessity is the mother of invention.
<br>
<p>I don't think #3 (shared social values) plays much of a role.  For the
<br>
most part scientists do not have &quot;shared social value complexes&quot; with
<br>
the majority in most societies (those brainwashed by religions).  Yet they
<br>
drive themselves to discover and create.  I've had this conversation with
<br>
the current director of the Univ. of Wash. Genome Center as well as the
<br>
discoverer of the Clock genes.  Scientists will tackle the problem because
<br>
&quot;it is there&quot; (with little regard for whether the prevailing social values
<br>
think it is of use).
<br>
<p>Having access to greater information certainly can stimulate creative thought.
<br>
How many ideas cross over from science fiction to science fact?  But it is
<br>
neither essential nor sufficient.  It may simply serve to promote the
<br>
aggregate quantity of creativity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so, the society that will conquer ours today will have even greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremes of those properties which cause creative thought.
</em><br>
<p>I'd say #1 and #4 are important.  Something along the lines of #5 (and
<br>
inexpensive access to &quot;play&quot; with the technology base) would be essential IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until genetic or other means is used to alter creativity in “humans”.
</em><br>
<p>There is a reasonable amount of evidence that you may not be able
<br>
to push creativity very far in humans without pushing them into the
<br>
realm of mental instability.  That is going to be a very tricky
<br>
problem to resolve.
