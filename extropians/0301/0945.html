<p><em>&gt; One possible way to improve the effectiveness of information sharing on
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; list might be to create a web-based structure of shared knowledge to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complement the discussion on this list.  It may be time now for an
</em><br>
extropian
<br>
<em>&gt; wiki site.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would allow us to capture knowledge and build upon it.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-centralized nature of a wiki would allow anyone (who cared enough) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create their own pages and link to others.  During discussion on the
</em><br>
current
<br>
<em>&gt; list, people could conveniently point to links on the wiki to provide
</em><br>
added
<br>
<em>&gt; depth or clarification. It would prevent a lot of repetition, and having
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; get the last word.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do others think?  Is it time?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not really familiar with wiki, but I think there is a *lot* of vitality
<br>
in the
<br>
list.  Perhaps its would be prudent not to take that vitality for granted.
<br>
<p>I don't have the skills to take on such a task without learning it from
<br>
scratch and can probably contribute better in other ways. But I think
<br>
if someone who does have the skills, took it on some time soonish, it
<br>
may have the effect of racheting up overall effectiveness considerably.
<br>
<p>Just my two cents.
<br>
