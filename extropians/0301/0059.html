<p><em>&gt; For the Raelians, I'm thinkin' a criminal charge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;reckless endangerment/disregard for human life&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent of the condition of the child, based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems observed in non-human cloning.
</em><br>
<p>But the life that you'd charge them with &quot;recklessly
<br>
endangering&quot; didn't even exist before their actions!
<br>
<p>It's a little bit like getting roadside assistance
<br>
from an absolute stranger and then blaming him 
<br>
because he didn't change the tire fast enough.
<br>
<p>If anybody doesn't treasure life that has been
<br>
brought into the world, it's not those who created
<br>
it, it's all the people who don't want to have to
<br>
look at it.  Naturally they are only too eager to
<br>
stomp it out, and pass laws so that their aesthetic
<br>
sense is never troubled again.
<br>
<p>If &quot;&gt;&quot; is a preference relation, then
<br>
<p>normal &gt; abnormal &gt; null.
<br>
<p>Unless you want to track down all the thalidomide babies
<br>
and tell them that not only would the world be better off
<br>
without them, but that they too would be better off never
<br>
having been born.
