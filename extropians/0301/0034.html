<p>
I've just forced myself to read all the way through Dr Gary Schwartz's THE
<br>
AFTERLIFE EXPERIMENTS, and found the experience somewhat unsettling. Despite
<br>
the non-stop treacle and warm fuzzies and horrendous physics, Professor
<br>
Schwartz [prof of--take a deep breath--`psychology, medicine, neurology,
<br>
psychiatry and surgery at University of Arizona and director of its Human
<br>
Energy Systems Lab'] and his medium and scientist (or perhaps `scientist')
<br>
colleagues appear to have provided some intriguing data.
<br>
<p>Is what's reported reliable? Well, even though skeptical reviewers like Ray
<br>
Hyman have attacked the program's many experimental weaknesses and
<br>
inadequacies, they appear not to have explained away the most surprising
<br>
results, nor shown, as one might expect, that the whole thing is a
<br>
concoction.
<br>
<p>If the material is indeed worth taking seriously, you'd think a
<br>
parapsychologist-manque like me would find the data congenial and easy to
<br>
account for *without* any appeal to discarnate entities who apparently have
<br>
nothing else to do except whiz over and provide random mediums and their
<br>
desperate sitters with blurry replies and big hugs and news of faithful
<br>
doggies that have `passed'. But as Schwartz points out in his closing pages,
<br>
the *personalized* and sometimes grumpy nature of the alleged information
<br>
source seems to contest any standard psi explanation.
<br>
<p>Of course there are many alternatives to `living info-energy systems' (LIES,
<br>
oddly enough, is the luckless acronym) that Schwartz does not even mention--
<br>
for example, the familiar one to extropes that we all dwell in a
<br>
higher-level simulation, in which mediums have partial superuser access and
<br>
their information is handled by robotic agents, etc--but his cited material
<br>
does seem far more detailed, non-coincidental and interesting than most of
<br>
the published results even from ganzfeld or remote viewing protocols.
