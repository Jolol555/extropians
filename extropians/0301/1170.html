</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How about answering the friggin question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The best reasons for not going to war are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1) It will not make America any &quot;safer&quot; and could make the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;international situation much more dangerous;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will make America immensely safer, because with a stable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pluralistic, democratic Iraq, we will defuse the arguments of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-US muslim radicals who claim we are against democratic governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in muslim nations. With allies like Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iraq as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples, muslim despots will find themselves increasingly isolated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even within their own countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you honestly believe that a pluralistic, democratic Iraq will 
<br>
be the result?  I don't see how.  I don't see how the arguments 
<br>
of the radicals are defused by showing that the country claiming 
<br>
to be a prime example of pluralistic, democratic values also 
<br>
claims the right to attack at will anywhere in the world and 
<br>
even use nukes.  I don't see how that positioning will 
<br>
strengthen the case of democracy over their beliefs.  It seems 
<br>
rather more likely to me that the people will be more inclined 
<br>
to turn away from whatever the nation that just blew hell out of 
<br>
their nation or threatens to believes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, with a democratic Iraq, Iraqi oil will be freely sold on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world markets, causing oil prices to plummet to $10/bbl ranges,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triggering budget deficits in muslim despot nations, forcing them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cut their funding of terrorist groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I guess we shall see.  I very much doubt there will be any such 
<br>
outcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;2) It will cost a large fortune when we are already economically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;tanked;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are hardly economically tanked. Last year's economy grew at a 3.0
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percent rate, hardly anemic. One thing that would help immeasurably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be to rescind the TRA of 1998 so that telecom companies can make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a profit running fiber into US households.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Tell it to the unemployed and the bankrupt businesses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;3) It will dirictly and indirectly result in the real deaths of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a guesstimated 100,000 - 1,000,000 people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bullshit. Absolute hogwash. Deaths from the Gulf War were somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between 40,000-100,000 and those were almost all combatants. Precision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guidance has improved immeasurably since then. We waged a much broader
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign in Afghanistan than we did in GW I, yet on 5,000 deaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The Gulf War was a much more delimited enterprise than this 
<br>
promises to be.  Wait and see.  But I would point out that your 
<br>
upper estimate for the Gulf War is my lower guesstimate.  So 
<br>
this hardly qualifies as &quot;hogwash&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With a quasi-independent Kurd government in the north acting as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; northern base, much better than the Northern Alliance served in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan, and acting as liasons between US forces and Iraqi military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; units, I expect that we won't even need to destroy as much Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment as we did the first time to achieve even higher surrender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, we shall probably see.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;4) Iraq, even if it had everything we cannot prove it has, would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not be a serious enough threat to justify the above nor would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;simple &quot;regime change&quot; remove any such threat;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A changed regime would be less likely to use any remaining WMD on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own people, not to mention on others. If we assure that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pluralistic government in place, and it looks like Khofi Annan is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizing plans for such an occurence, they will likely willfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismantle their programs much as South Africa did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;5) The American people do not want this war and it will tear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hell out the already fragile respect for government and law (not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that they deserve much) if this war goes forward;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see a majority in polls saying that it needs doing. I am quite sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your chattering intelligentsia buddies don't like it, but their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions have never reflected those of the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I will raise my &quot;chattering intelligentsia&quot; over your gibbering 
<br>
war goons and ghouls any day.  :-)
