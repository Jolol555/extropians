<em>&gt; &gt; _The Prince_ was an attempt to write a HOWTO-manual for rulers, showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what methods had worked and not worked in the past and explanations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why. For its time it was an amazing document, since it attempted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distinguish political science as the study of what people do or can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the study of what they *ought* to do - all previous books in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genre were essentially sermons about being a nice just ruler.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, all the previous pious advice was without practical effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.  Today, at least you'd have a (tiny) chance of affecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public sentiment due to much improved distribution of information.
</em><br>
<p>I think we underestimate the power of public sentiment because 
<br>
we are so used to it actually affecting politics. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In &quot;Discourses&quot; he emphasized that for a republic to survive, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needed to foster a spirit of patriotism and civic virtue among its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and I believe that he suggested means by which rulers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could attempt to inculcate such values in the citizenry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, this is a monumental task, trying to affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all the basic predispositions of the citizens.
</em><br>
<p>It is also rather doubtful that his scheme of uniting Italy
<br>
under a ruthless and strong king who would then foster
<br>
democracy and republican virtues would actually have worked...
<br>
<p>Of course, Machiavelli was a good theorist but rather bad at 
<br>
practice - when he tried to interest Lorenzo de Medici in his 
<br>
book, he was brushed aside as a far more interesting visitor (a 
<br>
dog breeder!) had appeared. Machiavelli also ended up in jail 
<br>
after some less-than-flexible political dealings. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Machiavelli pointed out that you should appoint a governor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the city, one of your men who you know is inclined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drastic solutions.  Privately, you even tell him that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will totally back his &quot;taking care&quot; of the problem.  After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he has rounded up and killed all the potential leaders of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a revolt, you &quot;hear about&quot; the atrocities and make a personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and loudly publicized visit to the town, and conduct an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;investigation&quot;.  You express your horror and outrage at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conduct of your governor, and have him promptly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publicly executed.  You then ask the town its forbearance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and assure them that so long as you remain their ruler, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further atrocities of this kind will ever be permitted.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so that was where Baron Harkonnen got his bright idea! 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be extremely difficult for most of the readers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list, certainly including me, to look a trusting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subordinate right in the eye and lie like that, planning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his death, and using him as a pawn.
</em><br>
<p>One has to remember just what kind of men did get to become
<br>
rulers during this time - most were literal killers from the
<br>
battlefield. It was a brutal and warlike time; that it also
<br>
left a lot of refinement, scholarship and art is a great irony. 
<br>
We better make sure *our* renaissance is less brutal. 
<br>
<p>My experience from live roleplaying is that lies and betrayal
<br>
is something that can be trained. I have due to casting reasons
<br>
(I hope) almost always played machiavellian (in the bad sense)
<br>
characters and found it easy to lie the entire council in the
<br>
face and then quietly betray my closest allies three times
<br>
during the evening. I sincerely hope it does not carry over
<br>
that easily in real life (after all, it is just a game and
<br>
nobody *really* gets killed), but I have no doubt that such
<br>
character traits could be cultivated if necessary. That is the
<br>
charm and problem with being a human - we can so easily
<br>
reprogram ourselves. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; He was an important step forward, and I actually prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the politician who has read his books (*all of them*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to somebody who proudly declares himself to be anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Machiavellian. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's for sure.  That latter politician is no doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just posturing.  I recall Clinton announcing at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outset of his presidency that it was to be the &quot;most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical administration ever&quot;.  The utterance of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grandiose statements in itself is becoming a giveaway.
</em><br>
<p>That is something Machiavelli never got the chance to see: the
<br>
growth of media and propaganda. He works with straightforward
<br>
rumor and desinformation - today we have sophisticated
<br>
propaganda and also a media-savvy public that loves to ironize
<br>
over the real meaning.
