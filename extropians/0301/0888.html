<p>
Bill,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have begun reading a lot of books on the latest thinking in military 
<br>
tactics.  You know the sort of thing a lieutenant with ambitions of having a 
<br>
career would be studying.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the chief conclusions is that we Americans have taught and 
<br>
fought our tactics all over the globe.  As a result every nation on Earth 
<br>
that studies war knows exactly how the Americans fight and they have devised 
<br>
tactics to use against our system of fighting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, they conclude that we won in Gulf War One so handily because we 
<br>
finally met an opponent that was stupid enough to play straight into our 
<br>
strength.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other very important conclusion was that no one had beat the 
<br>
American in single battle (consistantly) since the Second World War.  
<br>
Actually I have stated that incorrectly, they begin their studies as far back 
<br>
as Korea and can find no examples of the Americans losing single battles.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, of course we can think of battles the Americans lost.  The 
<br>
authors conclude the Americans won each of those battles on the field but the 
<br>
enemy won propaganda victories in that they managed to hurt the Americans 
<br>
badly enough that the politicians and chattering classes thought they had 
<br>
lost.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final conclusion is that our opponents now strive mightly to win 
<br>
the propaganda war.  Their goals are to bring down our political leaders and 
<br>
to win the peaceniks to their side.  Their is a very good book on this 
<br>
subject by David Horowitz.  He explains how he and some college friends 
<br>
gained control of the American Peace Movement, brought down LBJ, and 
<br>
eventually persuaded the American Congress to cut off the supply of bullets 
<br>
and bombs to the South Vietnamese resulting in the over throw of that 
<br>
government despite a totally lopsided record of winning in the field.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this: both Tony Blair and George Bush know that they are 
<br>
facing direct attacks on their leadership.  An attack that has proven 
<br>
formidable in the past.  As a consequence it takes great courage for them to 
<br>
do what they see as right.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative they have is to wait until further attrocities have 
<br>
been committed against us.
<br>
