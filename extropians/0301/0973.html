<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Who actually has the power now ... to *actually*

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's a deep question.  My suggested answer is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; decide, both individually and collectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ok. But is the question important?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I mean, in your view, do you think it would be useful for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; us to know, to identify, who *actually* has the power to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decide the &quot;level at which different decisions occur in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society [that are] crucial to society's well-being&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; [Y]es, it's one of those things that the electorate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a democratic republic has to keep an eye on.  I.e., who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it that is really making the decisions---and this feeds right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into my point that the decisions should usually be made at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lowest feasible level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So in this way, the hands of the legislators are presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; tied.  So, in summary, we would have to add to your list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     legislators and representatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     voters and electors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;   * ideas and memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;   * constitutional guarantees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's interesting but I think that the additions you make would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; normally be considered &quot;who's&quot; in the question &quot;who decides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who decides&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes,
</em><br>
<p>Ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I would agree that memes can influence decisive agents such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people.  But do you think memes become decisive agents in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Concretely, yes, memes are often decisive agents!
</em><br>
<p>That is interesting. Perhaps you are right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is because sometimes the best explanation has to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way a virulent virus-like idea spreads through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population with drastic consequences.
</em><br>
<p>I grant you that memes can influence. And since Dawkins coined
<br>
the term in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; in 1976 its may have taken on
<br>
different meanings to different people through frequent usage and
<br>
even over usage.
<br>
<p>But returning to the main point, can you think of an example where
<br>
the &quot;best explanation&quot; to 'who decides' is *actually* a meme?
<br>
<p>I can't offhand. But you may be right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It seems that we are in agreement that it is the constitution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legislation that codifies the legal rights people have and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; codifies who actually gets to decide particular things at particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Wouldn't you say that laws and constitutional guarantees are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; codifications rather than decisive agents in themselves?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I guess so.  When a legislator or executive is hauled up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short on some intended action by the existence of a strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worded codification to the contrary, a minor miracle has just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened.
</em><br>
<p>Hang on. I can't agree with you there. At least not yet. Not even
<br>
the most strongly worded codification actually pulls anyone up.
<br>
Law enforcement agents (people) do. If we are interested in
<br>
&quot;who decides&quot; and you've agreed its an important question,
<br>
I think its important to distinguish between decisive agents and mere
<br>
influences on those agents. But, in any case, a codification does
<br>
not itself pull anyone up. The codification is the formal embodiment
<br>
of the law. Codifications don't and can't enforce themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Anders wrote today in another thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The problem with building liberal democracies is that it is not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     about writing a nice constitution but to get institutions to actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     respect the rights set down therein.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;     It is about the same problem as Hernando de Soto described
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     about bootstrapping a market economy: if the culture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     institutions are not right, it won't work outside small sectors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    You need to set up the culture and institutions that act as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     checks and balances, and this can't be done overnight and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     must be done while building the rest of the constitutional system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But when the culture is right, these legislators and executives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are &quot;controlled&quot; by the statutes and codified prohibitions.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really is in a way as though the constitutional provision is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;active agent&quot;.  Doesn't it seem so, in a way?
</em><br>
<p>It does *seem* so in a way. But you've put 'controlled' in quotes and
<br>
I think your right to do so because beyond first blush I don't think it
<br>
actually *is* so.
<br>
<p>Let's explore. Let's see if we can make an exhaustive list of all those
<br>
types of agent who decide. I reckon it may actually be a very short
<br>
list and that could be a powerful insight - but I'm not sure.
<br>
<p>I think the codifications *embody* the law, but they don't and can't
<br>
exert control of themselves, rather the *control* is exerted by human
<br>
agents such as judges, lawyers, police and even ordinary citizens who
<br>
'know their legal rights' and are willing to point at, and, if necessary,
<br>
get
<br>
others, (complete strangers sometimes), to come to their assistance
<br>
by reference to the codifications. It seems to me that societies
<br>
members form alliances with each other to support those who happen
<br>
to be aggrieved and who can point at the codification and say that that
<br>
is where they have been aggrieved. And that if society is to cohere a
<br>
breach of the social compact, when, and only when, it is invoked by an
<br>
agent, (a person), becomes a call to the members of society to defend
<br>
not just that person as an instance but the very cement that is the
<br>
principles of that society itself (and all it means to the security of its
<br>
members) as codified for all to reference.
<br>
<p>I think we can do without imputing control, or intention to control on
<br>
to the codification itself in our search to determine &quot;who decides&quot;.
<br>
But maybe you have a good counterpoint to this.
<br>
<p>What do you think? Would you agree that &quot;statutes&quot; and &quot;codified
<br>
prohibitions&quot; don't actually exert control of themselves, but rather that
<br>
it is always human agents who do so and validate their action to other
<br>
human agents by reference to the codifications? Do you agree with
<br>
this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems we can't really appeal to memes or constitutions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; change themselves. I suspect that whilst your additions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the list make sense if the question was &quot;what are some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things that influence who decides who decides&quot; but I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so sure that they add any further active agents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, all that's true.
</em><br>
<p>Ok
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It seems like constitutional guarantees are interpreted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enforced and even occasionally formulated and codified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but they are not actually consulted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, in a way they are consulted, aren't they?  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Seriously, I don't think they are. But I'm open to any counterpoint.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mean,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if they are so numerous and detailed (e.g. laws)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that someone must consult them to ponder the exact meaning.
</em><br>
<p>It is true that the whole body of codifications that make up
<br>
say the US constitution, state laws, local by-laws etc are quite
<br>
complex and lengthy and especially as one gets more provincial
<br>
more variable from time to time and probably less consistent
<br>
sometimes too.
<br>
<p>But none of this complexity creates consciousness in the
<br>
codifications in my view. The whole body of codifications are
<br>
not actually ever consulted as such, though speaking loosely
<br>
and with the human tendency to anthropomorphise I can imagine
<br>
that it would be quite easy for a lawyer to say that something
<br>
like she would &quot;consult with the literature and get back to you&quot;
<br>
but I think that's just loose talking.
<br>
<p>I don't think consulting is actually thought of, when it is seriously
<br>
thought of as we are doing here, as meaning that the codifications
<br>
have become agents and can be party to a consultation which
<br>
implies active participation by both parties. The laws are not
<br>
participating they are just passive codifications, in paper or
<br>
electronic form, they are read. Where explicit codifications such
<br>
as statute law are not available then implicit codifications such as
<br>
common law (with all its principles of precedent and jurisdiction etc)
<br>
are investigated by human agents. In common law, because by
<br>
definition it applies where the codifications are not explicit (i.e.
<br>
&nbsp;there is no directly relevant statute) lawyers from different camps
<br>
&nbsp;(pro and con) may try and argue for the application of general
<br>
principles and the implied spirit and need for consistency in law
<br>
to produce a particular conclusion to a judge, still no actual
<br>
*consultation* with any the legal code itself occurs.
<br>
<p>Sure we could &quot;say&quot; it does if we wanted to speak loosely, and possibly
<br>
when people are not concerned with finding out really &quot;who decides&quot;
<br>
would speak loosely. But we have a reason to speak clearly here.
<br>
We want to find out &quot;who decides&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I reckon we can reduce the domain of &quot;who decides who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decides&quot; merely to &quot;sentient agents&quot;. To actual people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wouldn't you agree?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, that's a good question
</em><br>
<p>I reckon if we can get to agree that who decides is only sentient
<br>
agents, only people, then we may have a powerful insight into
<br>
&quot;who decides&quot;. An insight that could have high utility. Especially if
<br>
it turns out, as I think it might, that it is *always* people who
<br>
decide, and *only* people who decide.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we might get to the useful view that all else are means
<br>
of influencing, rather than agents. If such was true perhaps
<br>
concentration only on the agents but being aware of the forms
<br>
of influence that can be brought to bear by agents on each other
<br>
may help us be more effective.
<br>
<p>Do you agree the insight *might* be useful if obtained?
