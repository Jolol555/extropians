<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is true that (a) when many people become frustrated or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; run out of energy, the temptation to take easy personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not frustrated.  Ron has made my killfile a while ago.
</em><br>
<p>The ultimate insult;  by the way, why tell people if
<br>
you don't read their stuff?  What possible use is it
<br>
except as a put down?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only way I see his stuff is by proxy of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posters, and this is what I commented on.
</em><br>
<p>But it was not about the *content* that you commented
<br>
upon.  It was upon his *suitability* to be on such an
<br>
elite list [giggle].  You have no idea how this kind
<br>
of attitude strikes me, but then maybe that's just 
<br>
because I was raised in the western U.S., am quite
<br>
the provincial, and react badly to elitism or
<br>
arrogance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because I'm honestly missing the point of why a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person with Ron's background and Ron's beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would find this list worthwhile.
</em><br>
<p>I think that he cleared that up for you.  But, as
<br>
you know, it takes all kinds.  If I have learned
<br>
anything, it's that there is no accounting for taste.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He might be not with Sauron, but he's certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Isengard.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, right.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He isn't naive. He's just with the enemy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and now finally I know for sure why you were
<br>
on my case last summer---I hadn't yet pegged you 
<br>
ideologically.  I too am with the enemy, a sort
<br>
of person who holds a world view not politically
<br>
correct by your lights.  You have no idea how
<br>
narrow and polarized that attitude strikes me.
<br>
<p>[Eugen changes the subject here back to the thread]

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was greatly enjoying Ron's and Harvey's exchanges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about &quot;secret evidence&quot;.  It was about 95% actual content
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't need any extra evidence for secret evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some pretty scary stuff passes several times a day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through my inbox.  Anyone who engages Google for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few minutes can't miss it, unless he's not engaging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Google, or wears rather selective blinders.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, there you've got it.  We all wear selective blinders
<br>
in alignment with our ideological filters.  To me, who
<br>
especially during the last year and a half has been
<br>
considering the U.S. more or less (less actually) at
<br>
war, these reports struck me as mostly whining from
<br>
my usual ideological adversaries (I do not refer to
<br>
them as &quot;the enemy&quot;).  A conservative American administration
<br>
was cracking down on foreign terrorists and not observing
<br>
the usual niceties.  As I say, I profited greatly from
<br>
Harvey's and Ron's exchange, because it helped explain to
<br>
me more aspects of the fine line, and provoked thought
<br>
about what really is appropriate in these times.
<br>
<p>I have further theories involving polarization (that, at
<br>
least to me are pretty obvious) and the way that leftists
<br>
will tend to focus on threats from the right and vice-versa,
<br>
each believing, with some justification, that their opposite
<br>
numbers are watching the other front.  But perhaps more
<br>
about that at some other time.  Most people on this list
<br>
don't even admit that they have their own biases, but,
<br>
(I guess) believe that they possess by accident of nature
<br>
the acme of objective and rational thought process.
