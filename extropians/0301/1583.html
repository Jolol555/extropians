</em><br>
<p>Not really. Put the activities of all neurons as a big vector:
<br>
(0,1,0,...,0.4,0.1,0,0.9) would mean that neuron two had activity 1 and
<br>
some of the others had mixed activities. The state of the entire system
<br>
can be viewed as a vector (or point) in a huge-dimensional space. As the
<br>
system changes, the vector changes. 
<br>
<p>In my network groups of neurons form &quot;hypercolumns&quot; where the sum of the
<br>
activities is always one (they correspond to completely covering sets,
<br>
like which of ten possible colors a thing is), so the vector is a bit
<br>
constrained to subspaces of the big N-dimensional space. In a sense I'm
<br>
moving on a product of sqrt(N)  sqrt(N)-1 dimensional spaces, if that
<br>
makes any sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pardon my ignorance, but how distinct are the neural states you're talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about in *real* neurons? (I know the rejoinder... &quot;What do real neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to do with neural network research, anyway?&quot; :) )
</em><br>
<p>In real neurons things are *much* messier, since there is no single 
<br>
state. A pyramidal cell can have parts of its dendrites firing or at 
<br>
least being quite active while the cell body is silent or firing; it is 
<br>
probably best to describe it as a large number of tiny compartments 
<br>
which can each be assumed to have the same potential, chemical balance 
<br>
and membrane state. I would guess a reasonably detailled cell model has 
<br>
around a thousand dynamical variables - so the total state space of a 
<br>
&quot;realistic&quot; neural network would be around 1000N at least (not counting 
<br>
what the synapses are up to). 
<br>
<p>As you say, neural network research tends to ignore this kind of 
<br>
complexity, which is a pity. That way it just turns into statistics with 
<br>
slightly dated buzzwords, and who cares? But doing real biological 
<br>
models give you the chance to hit the network with simulated dopamine 
<br>
while cackling with glee... 
<br>
<p><p>BTW, I loved the brinista song! Keep it coming!
