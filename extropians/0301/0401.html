<p>It was shown in my previous articles about the artificial intelligence
<br>
and human immortality that the issue of immortality can be solved
<br>
fundamentally only with the help of changing a biological bubble of a

human being to an artificial one....

New Scientist - 'Gadget printer' promises industrial revolution
<br>
==========================================================================

<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993238">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993238</a>

<p>The idea of printing a light bulb may seem bizarre, but US engineers are
<br>
now developing an ink-jet printing technology to do just that. The
<br>
research at the University of California in Berkeley will allow fully
<br>
assembled electric and electronic gadgets to be printed in one go. The
<br>
trick is to print layer upon layer of conducting and semiconducting
<br>
polymers in such a way that the circuitry the device requires is built
<br>
up as part of the bodywork. When the technique is perfected, devices
<br>
such as light bulbs, radios, remote controls, mobile phones and toys
<br>
will be spat out as individual fully functional systems without
<br>
expensive and labour-intensive production on an assembly line.

New Scientist - Data stored in multiplying bacteria

<br>
<p>A message encoded as artificial DNA can be stored within the genomes of
<br>
multiplying bacteria and then accurately retrieved, US scientists have
<br>
shown. Their concern that all current ways of storing information, from
<br>
paper to electronic memory, can easily be lost or destroyed prompted
<br>
them to devise a new type of memory - within living organisms.

Betterhumans - Human Cloning Backlash Begins: European Union Calls for

Science Blog - Scientists find first active jumping genes in rice
<br>
=================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/community/article686.html">http://www.scienceblog.com/community/article686.html</a>
<br>
<p>Researchers studying rice genomes have identified the species first
<br>
active DNA transposons, or &quot;jumping genes.&quot; The scientists also
<br>
discovered the first active &quot;miniature inverted-repeat transposable
<br>
element,&quot; or &quot;MITE,&quot; of any organism. Rice (Oryza sativa), an important
<br>
food crop worldwide, has the smallest genome size of all cereals at 430
<br>
million base pairs of DNA. About 40 percent of the rice genome comprises
<br>
repetitive DNA that does not code for proteins and thus has no obvious
<br>
function for the plant...

Tech Central Station - A Smear Continues
<br>
========================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/envirowrapper.jsp?PID=1051-450&amp;CID=1051-010803F">http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/envirowrapper.jsp?PID=1051-450&amp;CID=1051-010803F</a><br>
<p>When Bjorn Lomborg's book The Skeptical Environmentalist was published a
<br>
little over a year ago it caused an immediate sensation in the United
<br>
States and Europe for its unconventionally optimistic take on
<br>
environmental matters. At the time, I asked Ronald Bailey, the author
<br>
and editor of two books on the environment and the foremost expert in
<br>
the United States on the intersection of science policy and political
<br>
controversy, what he thought of the book. &quot;Lomborg doesn't have a clue
<br>
what's about to happen to him,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;I feel sorry for him.&quot;
<br>
Bailey was right.
