<p>What is mindshare?   There is some other -----share that is just
<br>
on the tip of my tongue, but not quite there, so I probably know
<br>
what you mean.  But perhaps you could say a bit more.
<br>
<p>You are claiming it was necessary to propagate the meme &quot;rights
<br>
are from nature and nature's God&quot;, or else lose out?  That's what
<br>
I meant to ask before.

<p><em>&gt; Where does the DRoK originate?

<em>&gt; I'd put it back at least as far as &quot;In Hoc Signo Vincit&quot;--Constantine's

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the sky and was told by the Christian God to whup the heathen butt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure if he saw the words in Latin or the Greek equivalent, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if he made the whole thing up as great PR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I kind of think the whole (monotheistic-) God &amp; country thing has all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been downhill from the time Constantine started doing his thing. Kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Christ. Now there's a meme that has worked overtime.

<em>&gt; PS: I seem to have been using a lot of Latin lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The above means &quot;In this sign I conquer&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He had all his men-in-arms paint it on their vestments and shields.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm told they made a lasting impression.
