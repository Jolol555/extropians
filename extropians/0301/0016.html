<p>
Some of us can't bring ourselves to speak face to face with students or others
<br>
about our memories, but there are other ways to pass along your experience and
<br>
insight into our war to the younger generation. 
<br>
<p>I'll take the liberty to share an email I sent to another brother yesterday,
<br>
regarding educating students about our war.  It's a thing which we, as SEA vets,
<br>
are best qualified to do.  It may be the only way many of these students will
<br>
get a true picture of what Vietnam was really all about.  We cannot rely on
<br>
&quot;Academia&quot; to get it right.  And it's another way which we, as TLCB members, can
<br>
get our own story out to the world.  See text below... 
<br>
<p>I think your stories would be great to share with students studying the war.  I
<br>
am on a list of Vietnam vets, a list which happens to include Dan Decker, who
<br>
have volunteered to be interviewed by students worldwide about the Vietnam War. 
<br>
Our names, email addresses and our backgrounds are listed at the Spartacus
<br>
Schoolnet Web Site, which is maintained by an educational organization out of
<br>
the United Kingdom.  Students can go there and choose from among the names and
<br>
ask the vets for interviews.  I've been doing this for several years, and in
<br>
fact, I turned Dan onto the site. 
<br>
<p>The requests from students are by no means constant.  There may be months go by
<br>
without any, then all at once I may begin getting four or five per week for
<br>
several weeks.  It has to do with the timing of classes during the school year. 
<br>
I have received scores of requests from students all over the world, including
<br>
the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Germany, Ireland, England, France, Canada, South
<br>
America, Australia, New Zealand and others I can't even remember. 
<br>
<p>It sometimes is a pain in the a** to keep up with it, but it is also satisfying
<br>
from the standpoint of helping to educate today's kids on what our war really
<br>
was about.  The students range from grade school kids to those working on
<br>
P.H.D's.  It really is rewarding when I get thanks and feedback from students
<br>
like, &quot;You really opened my eyes&quot; or &quot;You've given me a gold mine of
<br>
information.&quot;  Admittedly, many of them never write back, once they have what
<br>
they need, but those few who do, make the effort worth while. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, if you think you might like to participate, I'm sure they'd be glad to
<br>
add your name and bio to the web site.  You'll need to write them an email,
<br>
explaining you are a Vietnam vet and would like to participate in the student
<br>
interview room of the Vietnam War section of their web site.  They'll ask for
<br>
you to write an introduction for yourself, which they'll post on the web page
<br>
with your email address.  The email address to write is: 
<br>
<p>&lt; <a href="mailto:spartacus@pavilion.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20(TLCB)%20Re:%20Academia%20&amp;%20SEA">spartacus@pavilion.co.uk</a> &gt;.
<br>
<p>The Spartacus web site is about many subjects, besides Vietnam, which students
<br>
might need to research.  If you want to check out their web site, the Vietnam
<br>
War specific page address is 
<br>
<p>&lt; <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/vietnam.html">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/vietnam.html</a> &gt;
<br>
<p>There you will find a link to the Interview Room, which has the bios and email
<br>
addresses of the participating vets. 
<br>
<p>If you decide to try it, then decide later you don't want to continue, you can
<br>
ask them to pull your name from the site at any time.  I suspect you'll find it
<br>
rewarding as I and Dan have.
