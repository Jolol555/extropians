</em><br>
<p>I count three questions there:
<br>
<p>1. Is her course of conduct right?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have long had a hunch that this is exactly the wrong 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question to ask.  It brings bad memes and patterns of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thinking into play.  Let's try to be physicists for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment and consider instead the physical processes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involved, and think very carefully whether or not we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approve.  The latter is, again, physically all we have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---one must consider one's own brain as a physical 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;device and note its approval and disapproval.  Where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is &quot;right&quot; and what are its physical manifestations?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I ought to proceed to question 2 here, but it's extremely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important for my kind of &quot;moral relativist&quot;---if that's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what I am---to nonetheless stoutly defend my intolerance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and visceral hatred of some moral systems I disapprove of,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g., a system that allows or causes extreme amounts of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unnecessary suffering for no reason whatsoever.)
<br>
<p>2. Ought other adults in the vicinity to intervene to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevent it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to continue to push the approach that I have been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advocating.  Those other adults need to determine if it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is properly any of their business or not.  If my sister
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who lives with us tries that and all the rest of the family
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be as horrified as I, then, yes, I step in.  On the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other extreme, if she lives on a farm miles from anyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else, or lives extremely independently of everyone else,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then I suggest that it's none of my concern, properly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking, and refrain from acting on my approvals and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disapprovals.  In between these extremes is to be found
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a large number of hard cases that would be very difficult
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for me.
<br>
<p>3. If thalidomide doesn't work, might she then ethically truncate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the baby's limbs by surgery to ensure that she has brought into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existence some more people like herself, with her special rich
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idiosyncratic way of being-in-the-world?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Hal, who wrote &quot;That's a great question&quot;.  Such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions make me very unsure of what &quot;ethics&quot; means, and cause
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to wax skeptical that it should be considered.  But let's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consult the Golden Rule for an interesting insight.  According
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to that, what she's doing is quite ethical, as in one way that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is exactly what she would want her mother to do if the roles
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were reversed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although an ethical analysis defies me right now, I know whereof
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I approve:  I do not approve.  A human being with arms is a more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advanced creature than one without, and the &quot;rich culture&quot; of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the limbless far poorer than that of the great majority.  In 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every case, I would try to talk her out of it, and if it was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any of my business, I might very well use force.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I should stress at once that this is a thought experiment;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know of any tragic victim of thalidomide who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider for a moment doing this to another human.  But we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that many congenitally deaf or dwarfed people are eager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do the equivalent.)
</em><br>
<p>If in our search for consistency we encounter too much foul
<br>
weather, a retreat right here on this front might be in order.
<br>
We can give less weight to unlikely scenarios.  Only folks
<br>
who are extremely confident that they can obtain consistency
<br>
without sacrificing their comfort or equanimity believe that
<br>
simple solutions to these hard questions can be uniformly
<br>
discovered.
<br>
<p>One solution that appalls me is for certain strident types
<br>
to consult themselves as to what they like and don't like
<br>
(&quot;drugs BAD!&quot;, &quot;cutting off arms BAD!&quot;) and then rationalize
<br>
like crazy to justify their imposing their conclusions by
<br>
force or by majority tyranny.
