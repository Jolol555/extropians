</em><br>
<p>Max, you are probably highly correct.  The only caveat I would cite
<br>
is the risk to humanity by a large asteroid or comet.  The risks are
<br>
very very low -- but (from an extropic perspective) do we want to expose
<br>
ourselves to the risks?
<br>
<p>It is very sad but humanity can tolerate the deaths of millions of
<br>
people from hunger or aging -- it is an extropic &quot;loss&quot; but it is
<br>
not an extropic &quot;catastrophe&quot;.   (I'll note as an aside that the
<br>
Gates Foundation today launched an effort to deal with some of these
<br>
problems.)
<br>
<p>So I think there may be a discontinuity in the prioritization.
<br>
<p>We have to take the elimination of humanity *much* more seriously
<br>
than the elimination of parts of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is so much more promise in bio-, nano-tech and IT.
</em><br>
<p>Yes -- these promise to save many more of us in the long run
<br>
than space-tech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then later, when we can do fully virtual designs, we can design cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and efficient space travel.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know whether it is generally known, but my read of Eric Drexler's
<br>
literature and development history is that cheap access to space was
<br>
one primary reasons he pushed to develop nanotechnology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The space programme as it is today is only for a select few anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I honestly don't think the current space programmes will change this.
</em><br>
<p>IMO, it would be nice if the &quot;government&quot; space programs would confine
<br>
themselves to things that create a moderately direct civilian benefit.
<br>
GPS satellites, monitoring of IR heat signatures (from ICBM launches
<br>
or asteroids entering the atmosphere), etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Isn't that the more sensible route to take?
</em><br>
<p>And the more sensible route for putting humans into space would be
<br>
to allow the private sector to develop it from either a tourism
<br>
or construction standpoint (someone has to go out and fix the
<br>
Canadian Robotic arm when it develops problems...).
<br>
<p>But its for darn sure &quot;space&quot; isn't going to become a popular
<br>
destination when you have to sit yourself on top of a large
<br>
quantity of explosives and put yourself through 3+g of acceleration
<br>
for a number of minutes.  If we ever get a space elevator -- *then*
<br>
it might just become a reasonable tourist destination for people
<br>
other than those who clearly have excessive levels of testosterone.
