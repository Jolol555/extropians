</em><br>
<p>Are you really in a position to say that?  You've never explained exactly 
<br>
when you think force is justified... just resorted to your intuitions 
<br>
about when something is and isn't &quot;your business&quot;.  If your intuitions 
<br>
about when something is &quot;your business&quot; end up with you intervening at 
<br>
much the same points as someone who intervenes depending on their 
<br>
intuitions as to whether something is, as you put it, BAD, then what have 
<br>
you accomplished?  Even if &quot;Is it my business?&quot; and &quot;Is it BAD?&quot; are 
<br>
different intuitions, what is it that makes one more interesting than the 
<br>
other?
<br>
<p>I don't see how your reformulation advances on what I regard as the key 
<br>
questions, such as &quot;What kind of moral statements are communicable between 
<br>
humans?&quot;, and &quot;What kind of communicable moral criteria can third parties 
<br>
use to agree that third-party intervention is desirable?&quot;
<br>
<p>For me the archetypal example of a communicable moral case for third-party 
<br>
intervention is where party A is attempting to kill nonconsenting party B. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I will, if I can, intervene to prevent A from killing B. 
<br>
B will agree with me; A will disagree; but the important question is 
<br>
whether D, E, F, G, and H, who are also third parties to the interaction, 
<br>
are likely to agree with me and support my intervention, or intervene 
<br>
against me to stop me from interfering with A.  At this point the question 
<br>
of *communicable* moral statements becomes important.
<br>
<p>I find your morality strange, Lee, because it seems to me inconsistent. 
<br>
Why permit a woman to mutilate her baby, but intervene against me to stop 
<br>
me from stopping her?  You can, of course, claim that one is &quot;none of your 
<br>
business&quot; and the other is &quot;your business&quot;, but it's not clear to me why I 
<br>
should pay attention to this moral argument, or whether other third 
<br>
parties considering an intervention would.
<br>
<p>My own argument?  I freely admit that a woman mutilating her baby is a 
<br>
more complex case than a woman mutilating an actively protesting adult, 
<br>
since it involves an attempt to extrapolate forward what the baby would 
<br>
want, and since society has an existing concept of parents being allowed 
<br>
to exert control over children (not necessarily a concept I agree with, 
<br>
but nonetheless a part of contemporary 21st century morality).  One of the 
<br>
considerations I am taking into account is that an adult may always choose 
<br>
to clip his own limbs if his mother can convince him to do so, but 
<br>
surgically clipping an infant's limbs is presently an irreversible 
<br>
procedure.  But my decision will be based on a moral theory in which 
<br>
babies are sentients who may claim my protection, and not a parent's 
<br>
property; whether the police side with you, or me, will be determined by 
<br>
which moral argument is more successfully communicated to third parties.
<br>
<p>The same holds for a sentient in a simulation running on a computer you 
<br>
suppose yourself to &quot;own&quot;.  You've gone on record on saying that it is 
<br>
&quot;none of your business&quot; what someone does with &quot;their&quot; simulation.  I am 
<br>
just as much against ownership of a simulation as I would be against the 
<br>
claim that you &quot;owned&quot; the proteins making up a sentient you claimed was 
<br>
your &quot;slave&quot;.  &quot;Ownership&quot; is a communicable moral statement about access 
<br>
restrictions to certain patterns.  Even if your computer is running a 
<br>
sentient being, I do not in any way acknowledge your ownership of that 
<br>
sentient being, and neither, I hope, will society at large.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I feel that &quot;should&quot; is a perfectly good word, and one which 
<br>
has a meaning going beyond who got persuaded of what.  But in deference to 
<br>
your view of these matters, I have attempted to restrain myself to 
<br>
describing phenomena which you will find more readily observable.
