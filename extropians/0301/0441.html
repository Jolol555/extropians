<em>&gt; Seems &quot;the world&quot; is still awaiting proof on two propositions :

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notable, in the Clonaid case, is that around 11 days have passed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the birth of the alleged clone and no proof has been presented.
</em><br>
<p>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence....
<br>
Furthermore, if the Church of Government were intent on Inquisitioning
<br>
you for acting on such science (as was done 500 years ago in another
<br>
science that challenged the powers that be), you'd be circumspect about
<br>
offering up proof of your guilt.

<em>&gt; Meanwhile despite having 25,000 US troops in the Gulf and another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 75,000 on the way, despite Britain and now apparently France
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to send troops as well, the weapons inspectors have still not found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any evidence of WMD, no evidence (at least that I have heard of) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been presented linking Hussein to terrorist acts since the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gulf war.
</em><br>
<p>Ditto on rules of evidence as above. There is in fact evidence of
<br>
concealment in that significant quantities of chemical and biotoxins
<br>
known to be in inventory in 1998 are not accounted for in Iraq's most
<br>
recent Declaration to the Security Council. They have disappeared from
<br>
the tally, and Iraq refuses to disclose what happened to them.
<br>
<p>Just because someone hides something very well from you does not mean
<br>
it doesn't exist. If your ability to discover it is entirely dependent
<br>
upon their cooperation and disclosure, when they are not interested in
<br>
doing so, then you will never find what you are looking for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that a whole lot of people are getting dressed up who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be very disappointed to have no place to go.
</em><br>
<p>If you think they are not going anywhere, you are mistaken.
