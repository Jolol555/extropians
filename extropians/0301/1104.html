</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, to all &quot;extropians&quot;, I ask this question --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &quot;how do we prevent millions of deaths?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope a sufficient number of you boys come to your senses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before we are embroiled in a very UN-Extropic global war.
</em><br>
<p>Since when is war considered unextropic?
<br>
<p>Is it because of the wholesale destruction war creates? That, by
<br>
itself, may seem extropic on the surface, but wholesale destruction can
<br>
have quite extropic results. For example, the Yucatan asteroid impact
<br>
killed most life on earth, yet it cleared the slate of an ecosystem
<br>
which had gotten in a rut of chosing unextropic organisms, allowing
<br>
mammals to come to the fore and allowed the eventual evolution of human
<br>
intelligence, which is highly extropic.
<br>
<p>Was WWII unextropic? I don't think so. It eliminated several highly
<br>
unextropic regiemes and more importantly drummed into obsolescence
<br>
several rather unextropic ideologies.
<br>
<p>Was the Cold War unextropic? I don't think so either. It eliminated one
<br>
of the last two remaining empires on the planet and illustrated the
<br>
moral bankruptcy of collectivist ideologies. It also helped finance the
<br>
development of many very extropic technologies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a purely utilitarian perspective, one might say that building a
</em><br>
bunch of stuff and shipping it around the world only to blow it up,
<br>
sink it or burn it along with lots of other stuff is not very extropic,
<br>
an economic waste. Yet a better question to ask is why that stuff had
<br>
to be destroyed. It was destroyed in order to give a cognitive smack up
<br>
side the head to some culture which was behaving in very unextropic
<br>
ways that caused even more economic waste than was caused by the war.
<br>
<p>In the case of the Gulf War, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, we
<br>
could say that these two events freed up so much human capital and raw
<br>
materials that the economic boom of the 90's was unavoidable. In
<br>
economic history, the 90's were only rivalled by the 1920's in the
<br>
amount of growth as well as 'irrational exhuberance'. Both periods
<br>
experienced the two largest liberations of formerly repressed peoples
<br>
from bondage and into freedom in history, who finally obtained the
<br>
chance to see what free men and women can do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this, I will say that ANY war to liberate people from oppression
</em><br>
is extropic.
