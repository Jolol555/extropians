CAN CRYONICS SAVE YOUR LIFE?
<br>
<p>If you're interested in life extension and cryonics, book off the evening of 
<br>
Wednesday, February 26, 2003 from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM.
<br>
<p>The Toronto Transhumanist Association is pleased to sponsor a talk by 
<br>
cryonics expert Ben Best on the topic, &quot;Can Cryonics Save Your Life?&quot;
<br>
<p>Proponents of cryonics claim that low-temperature preservation of recently 
<br>
deceased persons may allow them to benefit from a future technology that has 
<br>
cured all disease and can rejuvenate people to a condition of everlasting 
<br>
youth.
<br>
<p>Best will discuss recent technical advances that are making cryonics 
<br>
increasingly feasible. He will also address the controversy surrounding the 
<br>
desirability of cryonics if it proves feasible and discuss existing cryonics 
<br>
organizations.
<br>
<p>Best is a Director of the Cryonics Society of Canada, a Director of the 
<br>
Cryonics Institute and President of the Institute for Neural Cryobiology.
<br>
<p>The event will be held in downtown Toronto at the Parliament library, 269 
<br>
Gerrard Street East.
<br>
<p>Admission is free, but seating is limited. If you are interested please 
<br>
contact George Dvorsky at <a href="mailto:george@betterhumans.com?Subject=Re:%20Can%20Cryonics%20Save%20Your%20Life?">george@betterhumans.com</a> to reserve your space.
