You won't even be close to fixing the major causes of death by 2010.
<br>
If by 2005 we fully understand how to isolate, cultivate and amplify
<br>
adult stem cells (pretty unlikely as well IMO), then you might begin
<br>
to make a major dent in the major causes of death starting around 2020
<br>
(at least in the well developed countries).  Even when you have fixed
<br>
the major causes of death, it seems likely that a host of new ailments
<br>
(akin to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc., i.e. late onset diseases)
<br>
will begin to appear as you start having more people push into their
<br>
110's, 120's, etc.  Those may require decades of study to unravel and
<br>
fix.

<em>&gt; It is also premised on the notion that once assembler technology is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieved (I predict in 2020, but this date is not crucial) it in
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; centuries to indefinite extension.

<br>
Assembler technology is not required.  A path to manufacture real
<br>
nanoscale
<br>
machines, e.g. real nanorobots, *is* required (I've discussed one in my
<br>
Protein Based Assembly of Nanoscale Parts paper).  The singularity is
<br>
not
<br>
required either.  Significant increases in computing capacity will
<br>
probably
<br>
make things go faster because it will speed up the semi-automation of
<br>
the
<br>
design of nanoscale parts and the simulation of functional nanomachines.
<br>
<p>A
<br>
2010 to 2019. This generation, after 2015 in particular, is used to its
<br>
parents being young. They have no expectation of ageing beyond maturity
<br>
or having to die. In the Third World, increased affluence due to
<br>
pre-assembler nanotechnology and the general Singularity and birth
<br>
control as well as perceptions of immortality lead to a reduced birth
<br>
rate, although this is offset by women being able to have children at
<br>
any stage. In this period political power is shared between the 1950s
<br>
generation (who would have earlier expected to retire at this stage) and
<br>
the 1960s generation. Wild swings in public perception and debate occur
<br>
as cultural templates as old as humanity and ones set up during the last
<br>
three centuries (when Western society began to have large numbers of
<br>
physically aged persons) are abandoned and others emphasized with new
<br>
vividness. The expectation of true immortality from assembler technology
<br>
and artificial and enhanced intelligence sets in.
<br>
<p>I note that if a certain number of people end up living forever, then
<br>
they are actually and objectively immortal now but do not yet recognize
<br>
it. Because longevity techniques are acquired over a number of years and
<br>
can take. various forms, immortality can be conceived as a streaming
<br>
process.

<br>
<p>What all these numbers suppose is that ever increasing amounts of
<br>
planetary resources are devoted to longevity.
<br>
<p>We see however, ever increasing resources devoted to palliative care
<br>
technologies .  It is not  currently assumed by government and major
<br>
planners that living extremely long or even forever is achievable,
<br>
desirable  or just plain in the interests of those with the control of
<br>
the major economic elements.
<br>
<p>If the world's resources used for creation of death, scrapping over
<br>
scarce resources both in a military nation to nation sense and a
<br>
non-military market control struggle are added to the cost for policing
<br>
and security it clearly dominates the pie.  Those profiting from this
<br>
portion of the pie have to first decide to stop creating profits from
<br>
death and decide alternatively to create profits from life.
<br>
<p>Yes technology has advanced as a result of most human endvours lately,
<br>
but the cost  in terms of  resources expended is monumental.
<br>
<p>There is also a slice of society which does not wish to live long
<br>
because they either feel death is natural or inevitable and efforts to
<br>
defeat death are a waste of time and resources.
<br>
<p>There is a segment of society that feels that if they personally cannot
<br>
live forever then no one else should either.
<br>
<p>&quot;why should Bill Gates live forever and not me?&quot;
<br>
<p>What is required is to develop a stategy to &quot;transform swords into
<br>
ploughshares&quot;, a Manhatten project on a global scale to transform the
<br>
human condition into the transhuman condition.
<br>
<p>&quot;as Nero fiddles Rome burns&quot;
<br>
<p>Can  any of us suggest  an overarching  methodology to accelerate this
<br>
process and increase its efficiency?
