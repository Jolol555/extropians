<p>Coool, thanks Mike.  {8-]
<br>
<p>Im still pondering how to create an instrument for
<br>
measuring ant velocity after an observation I mentioned
<br>
online a few months ago.  Ants were walking up into my
<br>
trash can, presumably biting off something edible, then
<br>
walking back down to their hill somewhere.  I moved
<br>
the can out onto the curb.  The ants that were still
<br>
inside came down the can, reached the pavement, lost
<br>
the trail, walked around in apparent confusion (or
<br>
in whatever is the ant equivalent of confusion) then
<br>
ended up getting back onto the can and walking back
<br>
up.  They were still doing this several hours later,
<br>
but I think they may have been walking slower after
<br>
that period of time.  Eventually some cluey ant
<br>
realized she had made perhaps several hundred
<br>
round trips, and still wasn't finding home.  She
<br>
evidently wandered off and the rest followed.
<br>
<p>I want to create a device to watch the ants over
<br>
a period of hours and record the flow and speed.
<br>
I have a digital video camera, but I haven't figured
<br>
out how to get the signal to the computer and have
<br>
the computer interpret the signal and reduce the
<br>
data.  Suggestions welcome.  My programming skill
<br>
is modest, but I know how to stack lenses to
<br>
focus a camera up close, and I would be willing
<br>
to spend up to about 500 bucks if a suitable
<br>
commercial product is available.
