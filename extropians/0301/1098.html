<em>&gt; (Reason &lt;<a href="mailto:reason@exratio.com?Subject=Re:%20List%20dynamics%20(was%20Re:%20Are%20we%20defeated%20by%20the%20very%20topics%20we%20feel%20passionate%20about?)">reason@exratio.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How easy are Wikis to hook into other data flows? For example, is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wiki-mailing list or Wiki-Forum hybrid with automated cross-posting a viable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beastie?
</em><br>
<p>A Wiki isn't a data &quot;flow&quot; at all.  It's a data buildup.  That's its
<br>
purpose: progressive refinement of a set of hyperlinked documents.
<br>
Each document does have an attached discussion page, and the Wikipedia
<br>
software in particular lets you e-mail authors, and contributors are
<br>
generally on a mailing list as well, but the Wiki itself isn't about
<br>
discussion for its own sake, its about resolution.
