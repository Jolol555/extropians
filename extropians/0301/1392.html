in that year there was a powerful peace movement in the land; it makes you

realize that peace movements are not always on the side of the angels.
<br>
<p>Kai,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think John said it well enough.  But as his point is extremely 
<br>
valuable let me restate it a different way.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US went to war against the Nazis in late 1941.  Because we had a 
<br>
powerful peace movement made up to a large extent (but not entirely) by 
<br>
members of various German American nationalist groups we didn't go to war in 
<br>
1940.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also had such a movement (made up of other people of course) during 
<br>
our Revolution.  Some of them formed loyalist groups of militia, others ran 
<br>
to Canada.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had such a group in 1812 but we hear little of them for one reason 
<br>
or another.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had such a group in our Civil War that would have left the black 
<br>
man a slave.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were present during the First World War and in fact Wilson was 
<br>
elected President playing to them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already discussed them during the 2nd World War.  I remember 
<br>
them during the Korean War by their stares every time I traveled in uniform.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have always been around and sometimes as in Vietnam, WWI &amp; WWII 
<br>
they have been powerful enough to contribute to a tragedy.
<br>
