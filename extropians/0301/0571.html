</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;So it wasn't just a psychological necessity for them--it was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;memetic necessity for mindshare.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is mindshare?   There is some other -----share that is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the tip of my tongue, but not quite there, so I probably know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you mean.  But perhaps you could say a bit more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are claiming it was necessary to propagate the meme &quot;rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are from nature and nature's God&quot;, or else lose out?  That's what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I meant to ask before.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Mindshare&quot; is a marketing term that (approximately) means &quot;aggregate
<br>
prominence or salience (leaping to mind) in the minds of the target
<br>
audience&quot;--and is often but not always used in senses related to
<br>
acceptance or approval rating. As a contrary case, al-Quaeda had a lot
<br>
of mindshare in New York City in late September 2001, but that's not
<br>
usually what commercial marketeers (who coined the term) emphasize.
<br>
<p>I am not claiming necessity. I am describing a tactical choice which
<br>
makes sense in context.
<br>
<p>I'm saying that given the extant, centuries-old memetic &quot;installed base&quot;
<br>
(to borrow jargon from the tech industry) of kings being literally
<br>
proclaimed to be ruling by the will of God (this mindshare being established
<br>
and ruthlessly promoted by Constantine, his successors, various Popes,
<br>
and every other royal rider on the By-the-Grace-of-God gravy train),
<br>
it _profited competitors for public acceptance of an alternative
<br>
social order to play as much as possible on the same field_, rather
<br>
than writing God out of the picture altogether.
<br>
<p>I think, for instance, the text of the Magna Carta has some Godding-about
<br>
in it. Hmm. Yup. <a href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/magframe.htm">http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/medieval/magframe.htm</a>
<br>
...I count five &quot;God&quot;s there.
<br>
<p>Later, even if some of the most gifted minds of the Enlightenment were
<br>
closet atheists, they pretty much publicly all genuflected in the direction
<br>
of Deism. Or at least such is my impression.
<br>
<p>If I were being argumentative a la Lysander Spooner, I might end my reply with:
<br>
<p>For me, I _see_ no &quot;social contract&quot;. Can you point to it, any more than
<br>
the Pope can point to God? Where is it written? When did I sign it?
<br>
<p>But that would be cheap of me, since I don't really care about the answer;
<br>
so kindly pretend I didn't ask.
<br>
<p>Cheerio,
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Where does the DRoK originate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I'd put it back at least as far as &quot;In Hoc Signo Vincit&quot;--Constantine's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;claimed vision-leading-to-conversion in which he saw a blazing cross
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in the sky and was told by the Christian God to whup the heathen butt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I'm not sure if he saw the words in Latin or the Greek equivalent, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;if he made the whole thing up as great PR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I kind of think the whole (monotheistic-) God &amp; country thing has all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;been downhill from the time Constantine started doing his thing. Kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for Christ. Now there's a meme that has worked overtime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;MMB
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;PS: I seem to have been using a lot of Latin lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The above means &quot;In this sign I conquer&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;He had all his men-in-arms paint it on their vestments and shields.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I'm told they made a lasting impression.
