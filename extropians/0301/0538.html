<p>Yes, they are (see below) -- but they *ablate*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see no reason

</em><br>
<p>You want to call a crystal a polymer? Go ahead. To me that's a bit like calling
<br>
cellulose an oligomer. Is anything that's not a liquid or a gas a polymer? If you squint.
<br>
Diamond is just cellulose that someone handed to Gaia and Superman.
<br>
<p>I agree that the old convenient categories are blurring; Spectra fiber is a hydrocarbon
<br>
polymer with crystal-like properties because of relatively highly-aligned molecules
<br>
chemically the same as the stuff used for cheap squeeze bottles when it's amorphous.
<br>
<p>The heat shields you mention (some have been made out of polyester-glass laminate;
<br>
are these what you're talking about? or if not, please be specific--some early ones
<br>
were made out of balsa wood) work well enough because the shock wave means the stuff
<br>
is in a relatively oxygen-starved environment, with radiative heating as the source
<br>
of the bulk of the energy to be dealt with, or so ISTR. And they do *ablate*, they
<br>
aren't passive. If you want to call a ceramic a polymer, we're back to Paragraph One.
<br>
<p>The original question had to do with Santa Machining a Lamborghini engine.
<br>
Ablative materials are probably not the best choice for IC cylinder parts.
<br>
Or for close tolerance turbines. So that whole angle is a strawman in context,
<br>
I fear.
<br>
<p>On to diamondoids and buckymaterials:
<br>
<p>The original question was posed in the context of stuff that could be
<br>
laid down the way the stuff at MIT is being laid down. I don't see the
<br>
dots connecting next week for supermaterials or high-performance ceramics.
<br>
Santa-lathes and -potter's wheels are not out of the question, of course.
<br>
<p>Slurries of nanocrystals were, however, mentioned in my reply, and I count both
<br>
diamonds and buckymaterials as being in the nanocrystalline camp at least as much
<br>
as in the polymer one. Ditto ceramics.
<br>
<p>I agree that all this stuff is heading for the wall; some of it will stick.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>I bet there are going to be a lot of buckymaterials that turn out to be pyrophoric.
<br>
That's OK, most of the fools out there accessorizing their cars with carbon fiber
<br>
'cause it looks baaad have no clue how it behaves in a crash, let alone a car fire.
