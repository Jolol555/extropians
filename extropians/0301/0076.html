<p>Yes. It's a way to provide social feedback in a medium completely lacking

nonverbal cues.

</em><br>
<p>Elitism has its uses, but this is not one of them. I think this list has a
<br>
cloud of common values loosely termed 'extropy'. The members occupy
<br>
several clusters distributed about these multiple axis. I must admit I
<br>
don't like the (very small) cluster at the edge yonder which Ron is
<br>
belonging to.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that he cleared that up for you.  But, as

<p>I have to go read his folder.

<p><em>&gt; you know, it takes all kinds.  If I have learned

</em><br>
<p>Yes.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, right.  
</em><br>
<p>I might have misclassified him, it's easy enough to tell. I'll just go
<br>
through his folder. If I did, I owe him an apology for being such a
<br>
jackass.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He isn't naive. He's just with the enemy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and now finally I know for sure why you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on my case last summer---I hadn't yet pegged you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologically.  I too am with the enemy, a sort
</em><br>
<p>Do you think I was on your case (was I?) because of ideology?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of person who holds a world view not politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct by your lights.  You have no idea how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrow and polarized that attitude strikes me.
</em><br>
<p>I have to admit I'm not all-inclusive. There are some 6 billions humans on
<br>
this planet. Not only do I not share every one's of these gigapeople's
<br>
values, it's in fact probably less than 10%. It could be as low as 1%,
<br>
though I haven't seen any statistics about shared values integrated over
<br>
the planet's population.
<br>
<p>You can call it elitist, narrow, or polarized, but I'm not agreeing that
<br>
intelligent design is better than darwinism as far as kid education is
<br>
concerned, that women must be veiled in presence of strangers, that
<br>
locking up, mutilating or killing people for minor offences is okay, that
<br>
you must yield upon caesar what caesar's is, that some things are just not
<br>
meant for humanity to know, and about ten pages more of similiar. In fact
<br>
your list of disagreements would be at least as long, and even have most
<br>
of the same items on it as mine.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Ah, there you've got it.  We all wear selective blinders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in alignment with our ideological filters.  To me, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially during the last year and a half has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering the U.S. more or less (less actually) at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war, these reports struck me as mostly whining from
</em><br>
<p>I must admit I've missed the nuking and the megadeaths. Apart from such
<br>
nice formalities as a declaration of war, what is the threshold for
<br>
classifying a conflict a 'war'? Isn't terrorism driven by cultural
<br>
conflict the far more appropriate moniker here? I refuse to discuss this
<br>
at the local politics level. We here need to take the global view, and the
<br>
long term view. The very longest, in fact. Let newspapers and advocacy 
<br>
forums handle the daily politics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; my usual ideological adversaries (I do not refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them as &quot;the enemy&quot;).  A conservative American administration
</em><br>
<p>The label doesn't matter. Adversaries, enemy, blue, 0x9345f. Their agenda
<br>
is not yours, and it can't be resolved by 'let's just agree to disagree',
<br>
that's all what it matters. We couple on the physical layer, so we can't
<br>
just go into orthogonal realities and live happily ever after perfectly
<br>
noninteracting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; was cracking down on foreign terrorists and not observing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the usual niceties.  As I say, I profited greatly from
</em><br>
<p>If this was all just about cracking down on foreign terrorists we wouldn't 
<br>
be having this conversation. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Harvey's and Ron's exchange, because it helped explain to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me more aspects of the fine line, and provoked thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what really is appropriate in these times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have further theories involving polarization (that, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least to me are pretty obvious) and the way that leftists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will tend to focus on threats from the right and vice-versa,
</em><br>
<p>It's a multidimensional distribution. The bipolar classification axis was
<br>
always so simplistic. My position is e.g. completely unrepresented in the
<br>
political krautscape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; each believing, with some justification, that their opposite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers are watching the other front.  But perhaps more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about that at some other time.  Most people on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even admit that they have their own biases, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I guess) believe that they possess by accident of nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the acme of objective and rational thought process.
</em><br>
<p>Of course I have my biases, and I stand by them. I don't want my mind so
<br>
open my brain splatters at my feet, thankyouverymuch.
