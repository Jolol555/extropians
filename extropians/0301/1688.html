<em>&gt; &gt; (2) Since when is &quot;credibility&quot; a rationally measurable unit?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since when is it not?  Do you deny the simple fact that some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more honest than others?
</em><br>
<p>Surely not, but how much is &quot;more&quot;? And why do people have so different 
<br>
opinions about the credibility of the same person, e.g., Mr Bush? Could 
<br>
it be that people weight the same facts diffenrently? How can that be, in 
<br>
a rational world?
<br>
<p>The Milgram experiment shows, how &quot;credibility&quot; (and obedience) can be 
<br>
faked with symbols of authority.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if all they do is speak, all I can do is speak in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return, and hope that humans with reasonable minds judge us both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, lies can become rumors, which can become &quot;common 
<br>
knowledge&quot;, which then lead to actions. Like &quot;if vietnam falls, the 
<br>
communists will invade the US&quot;. Or &quot;if the amis come here, they'll rape 
<br>
all german women&quot;. Or &quot;Saddam has WMDs&quot;, rsp. &quot;Saddam is really dangerous 
<br>
for us&quot;. See the book &quot;The Wave&quot; for an example, how fabricated &quot;truth&quot; 
<br>
can influence reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your contention that any kind of speech must be supressed
</em><br>
<p>Ah, waitaminute. I said &quot;unlimited lying&quot;. This term contains two words. 
<br>
The first means &quot;without any restrictions or boundaries&quot;, the second 
<br>
means &quot;distribution of untrue allegations&quot; :-) Together, it means, I'd 
<br>
like to have a way to stop _only_ the unrestricted distribution of untrue 
<br>
statements about my person.
<br>
<p>We don't live in an ideal, rational world. People do judge by rumors and 
<br>
reputation, which is almost never true, objective or rational. You, for 
<br>
example, judge me -whatwasit- to be &quot;left-wing&quot;, &quot;anti-american&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;naive&quot;, etc. without any knowledge about me but the few words I've 
<br>
written here. 
<br>
<p>If therefore someone uses this human behaviour to damage someone others 
<br>
reputation by telling lies about him, this can have drastic as well as 
<br>
subtle consequences for the victim. Example: &quot;Lee Daniel Crocker is a 
<br>
child molestor. Protect your kids, force him out of this town&quot;. What 
<br>
would your defense be? Ask for evidences? Have you ever seen a 
<br>
witch-hunt? Remember McCarthy?
