<em>&gt; &gt; You need to look no further than the current case of Zacarias Moussaoui
</em><br>
who is currently on trial in federal court.
<br>
<em>&gt; Is this the character you have been touting as an American Citizen being
</em><br>
imprisoned on secret evidence?
<br>
<p>No, not at all.  This was to prove that the Bush Administration desires to
<br>
use military tribunals instead of the civil courts so they don't have to
<br>
reveal their secret evidence to the judges or the civil court system.  I
<br>
don't remember making any claims about American citizenship for any of these
<br>
cases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He has not been imprisoned as yet.  He has been held as a bad risk of
</em><br>
fleeing our nation's jurisdiction.
<br>
<p>OK.  I am not arguing this fine distinction of terminology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And once again you are wrong on all counts.  A military tribunal is a
</em><br>
court.
<br>
<p>Again, I am not arguing this fine distinction of terminology.  By &quot;courts&quot; I
<br>
meant the civil courts and by &quot;military tribunal&quot; I meant the military
<br>
tribunal courts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can bet that a civilian court will have to rule on the legality of
</em><br>
transferring the defendants case to a military court before he can be tried
<br>
in the military court.
<br>
<p>For transfer, yes, only because he is already in the custody of the civil
<br>
system and in the middle of a civil trial.  For defendants who are taken
<br>
directly to a military facility to undergo a military trial, the civil
<br>
courts do not have to give their permission.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In addition your statement &quot;without giving any information to the courts&quot;
</em><br>
is pure hyperbole.  Military courts come under the jurisdiction of what is
<br>
called The Unified Code of Military Justice.  The UCMJ was passed by
<br>
Congress in the late 40s and is a strict but fair set of laws.  Every person
<br>
entering the military is lectured extensively about the code upon entry.  I
<br>
passed a course in the UCMJ that went into even more depth and lived under
<br>
that code for over four years.  So has every other ex-serviceman under age
<br>
of 70.  I have read that studies show a higher percentage of defendants beat
<br>
the rap in military courts than in civilian courts.
<br>
<p>You don't have to lecture ME about Military Justice!  I served my country as
<br>
a security intelligence reconnaissance expert for black agencies that don't
<br>
officially exist.  I was EXTENSIVELY briefed that if I was deemed to have
<br>
leak any information into the public domain I would &quot;disappear&quot; into the
<br>
secret military system.  I have no rights to lawyers, trials, juries, no
<br>
right to see the evidence, no right of appeal, no right to a public
<br>
statement, and no right to have my family or friends notified of why I
<br>
disappeared.  I knowingly signed away these rights to perform specialized
<br>
security services to my country.  I know VERY WELL how secret military
<br>
tribunals work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;For future cases held in the secret military tribunals, the courts
</em><br>
would not even be informed that the event had occurred.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; Where did you ever get the idea that we have such a thing as a &quot;secret
</em><br>
military tribunal?&quot;
<br>
<p>If you would just read the newspaper or any of the links I provided, you
<br>
would know that an alternate system of military justice is available for
<br>
prosecuting enemy combatants outside the civil court system.  Most people
<br>
think this is a new invention for the use on terrorists, but I personally
<br>
know that this system has existed for a long time.  You yourself referenced
<br>
the Military Code of Justice above.  You must be nitpicking on the single
<br>
word &quot;secret&quot;.  The only point you aren't getting is that for interests of
<br>
national security these military trials can be held in secret without
<br>
informing any branch of government outside the military.  Bush has even
<br>
authorized the assassination of certain enemy combatants without any further
<br>
involvement or notification of any branch of government.  These
<br>
authorizations for the military to operate in secret are common in times of
<br>
war and in areas of national security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The military is almost always sort of strict but wonderfully open and
</em><br>
direct.  Everyone around the trial area will know about the trial.  Maybe
<br>
someone can help me with this also, I haven't studied the UCMJ for 45 years
<br>
but Harvey says &quot;the courts would not even be informed that the event had
<br>
occurred.&quot;  Assuming that Harvey means that the civilian courts would not
<br>
even be informed of the military trials after the first one, isn't it true
<br>
that all military trials come under the Federal Court system and can be
<br>
appealed in Federal Court?
<br>
<p>Not when national security is as stake.  Military tribunals can execute
<br>
military justice in matters of national security or during wartime or during
<br>
emergencies that cannot be appealed.  Appeals, if any, for a secret military
<br>
trial would also be in a secret military court.
