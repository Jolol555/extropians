<p>
Calling Mr. Bush an idiot (in the true meaning of the word) is
<br>
definitelly wrong but there is no evidence so far that he is
<br>
extraordinarily bright. But I wrote &quot;Bush *family*' if you noticed
<br>
that. This is actually wrong. I should have written 'Bush clan' or
<br>
something. Mr. Rumsfeld, Powell.... are definitelly not a part of his
<br>
family. They are orders of magnitude smarter than Mr. Bush Jr. And they
<br>
belong to that clan. I won't claim to know the internals of USA
<br>
politics but my impression is that it is them who hold the keys and
<br>
they don't care who is President under them.
<br>
<p>In my previous mail, I didn't offer an alternative. Here is one every
<br>
European: Do nothing and keep Iraq under embargo. Rationale: Mr.
<br>
Hussein is an old man. He has a few more years to go, at most. The
<br>
problem might just go away &quot;naturally&quot; just like Franko of Spain went
<br>
away. There is no guarantee that what follows Mr. Hussein is a
<br>
democracy with a free press and all the other freedoms we treasure. I
<br>
believe this is the way with the fewest victims.
