<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you truly believe that the US have troops in Europe to protect the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you truly believe that pulling US troops out of Europe would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no negative consequences for Europe, the same might be said of you.
</em><br>
<p>Considering that we seem to live in different universes, could you
<br>
please be more explicit?  I'm prone to misunderstand your allusions.
<br>
A few communities around the US bases would be hit hard economically,
<br>
but that's probably not what you had in mind, is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why did France test those nukes *right after German reunification*?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone care to answer? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?
</em><br>
<p>Because their nuclear weapons program happened to require exploding
<br>
actual warheads at that time.  The very idea you seem to be proposing
<br>
that this was some sort of signal against Germany is just too
<br>
ridiculous.  (Actually, France offered to explicitly extend its
<br>
nuclear protection to Germany.)
<br>
<p>To my generation the idea of armed conflict between France and
<br>
Germany is inconceivable and the accounts in history books about
<br>
the enmity of past centuries look truly bizarre.  I'm not sure how
<br>
to phrase this in terms an American can understand.  How about this:
<br>
How likely is the outbreak of Confederation/Union hostilities in
<br>
the contemporary USA?
<br>
<p>France and Germany may not be growing together as quickly as one
<br>
might hope--that hard language barrier is pesky, and the structural
<br>
differences between the two countries are enormous after a millennium
<br>
of separation--but I'm feeling increasingly reluctant to employ
<br>
terms such as &quot;foreign&quot; when refering to the sizable chunk of
<br>
continental Europe that has reduced borders to lines on maps, shares
<br>
the same currency, allows me just take up residence and work wherever
<br>
I may please, etc.
<br>
<p>The raving US American nationalists that have largely hijacked this
<br>
list since September 11, 2001 (and diverted it from Extropian themes
<br>
to atavistic talk securely rooted in the frame of mind of the nation
<br>
states from the first half of the 20th century--but I digress)
<br>
display an understanding of the world that is so incredibly distorted
<br>
and removed from reality that I'm largely left speechless.
