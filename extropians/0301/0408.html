<em>&gt; &gt; Even in values, it is unwise [as Brett has pointed out] to

<em>&gt; &gt; say &quot;Blah, blah blah, and blah. This is what I BELIEVE!&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; e.g., &quot;It is horrible and obscene and cruel and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; WRONG for a woman to cut the arms off her daughter, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE&quot;, completely shutting oneself down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to further critical inquiry and pursuit of consistency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An example comes to mind:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I BELIEVE that &quot;human life&quot; begins at conception, therefore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; should not be permitted *even* if it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be shown that the lives of many sick people would be saved by it&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---------
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but in fairness to the anti-abortionists, it should
<br>
be noted that this example is hypothetical.  I don't ever
<br>
remembering seeing any of them use this wording, and
<br>
therefore reveal themselves as suffering this problem.
<br>
<p>True, many of them seem to act as though this is how 
<br>
they are thinking---but on the other hand, there are
<br>
many reasoned defenses of the anti-abortionist stand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This example doubles up two of the unwholesome trinity of bad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme-words &quot;believe&quot; and &quot;human life&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>But can't you think of innocent sentences that contain those
<br>
concepts (the innocent form of the &quot;I believe&quot; one, anyway)?
<br>
As I said earlier, I think that one must read between the
<br>
lines, and be on the lookout for bad concepts, and that the
<br>
particular words employed aren't a reliable guide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *If* the stakes were not so high, it would almost be comic that the,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;true believers&quot; defense of &quot;human life&quot; leads to an increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the chances of actual persons (sick people) dying earlier and harder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than they otherwise might have.  
</em><br>
<p>The burden of proof is definitely on them to suggest how
<br>
it could be that allegiance to human life or living could
<br>
result in banning, for example, stem cell research.  But
<br>
we do know what they'd say; it would be something like
<br>
<p>&quot;When you understand that (a) human life really begins at
<br>
conception and (b) politically, the use of stem cells will
<br>
inevitably lead to the sacrifice of many innocents, then
<br>
you will understand that suppressing this evil really is
<br>
better for human life and human persons in the long run.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course you and I balk at the idea of 10^-4 seconds
<br>
before conception there is zero (0) persons and 10^-4
<br>
seconds following conception there is one (1) fully
<br>
equal human being.  AND THAT'S WHERE OUR REAL DIFFERENCES
<br>
WITH THEM LIE!  Not in word usage (this time).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But then the &quot;true believers&quot; don't really believe the dead are &quot;dead&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they are often quite willing to act on that &quot;belief&quot; and implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy consistent with it if they can. And policy that becomes law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applies to everyone. 
</em><br>
<p>Again, I see nothing semantically wrong with their belief.
<br>
If I thought that the fact was that there is a Supreme Being
<br>
who'd deliver the actual consciousness of dead people to
<br>
Heaven, then I'd have no objection to what they claim.  It's
<br>
only an *ontological* difference I have with them, not a
<br>
semantic one.
<br>
<p>(By the way, there is a huge difference between terminological
<br>
disputes, which are comparatively trivial, and semantic ones
<br>
which involve concepts.  Korzybski's general semanticists have
<br>
succeeded in spreading the correct memes concerning the latter IMO.)
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Well..., perhaps conciseness has never been your long suit  ;-)
<br>
so to speak.  But your ability to focus and penetrate on important
<br>
matters more than makes up for it!
