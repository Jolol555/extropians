<p>&quot;Under the law of nature, all men are born free, every one comes into
<br>
the world with a right to his own person, which includes the liberty of
<br>
moving and using it at his own will. This is what is called personal
<br>
liberty, and is given him by the Author of nature, because necessary for
<br>
his own sustenance.&quot; --Thomas Jefferson: Legal Argument, 1770. FE 1:376 
<br>
<p>Thanks for that!  It perfectly illustrates the error unmistakably.
<br>
<p>It is patently false that humans are born free or with a
<br>
right to his or her own person.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Mike explains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The deist view is essentially that Natural Law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is Objective Truth, embedded in the structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and function of the universe, and exhibited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in our daily lives by much more than gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and relativistic effects, but also biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution and the development of intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and individualistic generalist organisms such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh!  It suddenly dawns on me that you are explaining what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural laws are, as, for example, Newton's.  Well, of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they exist!  They are objective constraints on what can happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in our universe.  They are patterns that were here before us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and (heaven forbid) will be there after us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet the deist/Natural Rightist sees no difference or delamination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between Natural Law i.e. the laws of physics, and the Natural Rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Man.
</em><br>
<p>Evidently not!  As the Jefferson quote above perhaps illustrates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our Natural Rights evolve specifically out of our evolution, via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural selection, as individualistic social primates with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclination toward tool invention and use and exploration of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habitat.
</em><br>
<p>It really surprises me that a number of distinguished
<br>
thinkers can believe in such a thing given the modern
<br>
discoveries in so many branches of science, but especially
<br>
anthropology.  You're quite clear and correct about
<br>
&quot;individualistic social primates with an inclination
<br>
toward tool invention&quot;, but what has this to do with
<br>
rights?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transhumanism is a further development of this Enlightenment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy.  As Greg Burch and Max More have previous said, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see ourselves as a more honest and consistent evolution of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enlightenment philosophers than modern humanists and self-described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals, much as we see the US revolution as a more honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expression of that philosophy than the French Revolution.
</em><br>
<p>I could agree more, but not by much.  What the Enlightenment
<br>
philosophers achieved in my book is they described the ideas
<br>
(notions) that were being developed in their times, consciously
<br>
or unconsciously, and expressed two important other things:
<br>
One, that they highly approved of these new views, and that
<br>
two, such assumptions embodied into habit and legal precedent
<br>
*worked*, i.e., made societies more prosperous and resourceful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Both modern humanism/liberalism and the French Revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tread down paths to tyranny, genocide, dehumanization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individual, and pastoral romanticism/mysticism.
</em><br>
<p>Well, their hearts are in the right place, and that's
<br>
one of the most important things to them.
<br>
<p>Lee
