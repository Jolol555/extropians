This is true in and of itself when considering individuals. However, one has
<br>
to consider communities and the way in which open information exchanges
<br>
grow, spread memes and spawn concrete real world actions. (Either by
<br>
spurring people to action, or by recruiting people who have the right
<br>
mindset to go out and do something rather than or in addition to yapping).
<br>
<p>For ever person that goes out and does something concrete, there are a
<br>
hundred followers. The only real, useful way in which most of us
<br>
(comparatively poor, lacking relevant skills) can encourage an increase in
<br>
the amount of useful work is by growing the communities. Look after the
<br>
headcount, and the leaders and activists look after themselves.
<br>
<p>I'm actually hoping that the ongoing growth and increasing sophistication of
<br>
the WTA communities and online properties will spur ExI into some similar
<br>
growth patterns. But we shall see.
<br>
<p>As you might guess, my goal for this coming year is to make an effort to
<br>
corral some of the many diverse transhumanist and transhumanist-flavored
<br>
online communities and static information generators into more productive
<br>
cross-talk; it's a necessary efficiency increase that needs to happen
<br>
earlier rather than later. 1000 people in 10 100-person groups is far less
<br>
effective than greater cross-linkage in a single community of 1000. I think
<br>
that this a more valuable use of my skills than, say, striking out on my own
<br>
or allying to one subcommmunity to promote growth and meme-propagation.
<br>
<p>Finally, yes, there needs to be more doing. All too many people throughout
<br>
the transhumanist community are way too complacant about the future. You
<br>
don't do, it won't happen. It doesn't matter how cool your view of the
<br>
future is -- if that view remains a niche, it won't happen. So get off your
<br>
collective behinds and do something to make it happen. If you're at a loss
<br>
as to what to do, then help to grow the community: introduce transhumanism
<br>
to someone new today.

<em>&gt; Sent: Saturday, January 25, 2003 12:34 PM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To: Extropy List
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subject: Talking vs. doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had a couple of off list exchanges over the last day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or so that have in some ways enlightened me and in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways depressed me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As some of you know, I sometimes go into &quot;rant mode&quot;, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part to get people to sit up and do some self-examination.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can label this message semi-rant mode.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm on the board of the Extropy Institute.  I'm one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more frequent contributers to the list (because I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more free time than most of the other board members).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I've explained to some people off-list recently I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always *forcing* myself to face extropic priorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can I call myself an &quot;extropian&quot; or consider myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a responsible board member if I do not do that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as often as I can look at myself in the mirror?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how do I set up my extropic priorities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Aging, malnutrition/starvation (perhaps poverty), AIDS, Malaria,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   perhaps murderous tyrants, ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I take them in a very rigid line of what destroys the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrated information (e.g. human lives) each year.  (This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not guaranteed to be the best approach -- one could take an approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that tries to save the greatest number of future lives which might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in a much different weighting.)  But it *is* an approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I can look at, put some numbers on and evaluate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic &quot;return-on-investment&quot; that I may be receiving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my (perfect) world we would be allocating resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to defeat these problems on a pro rata basis -- to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent of the problem so should be the resources devoted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to solving them.  I realize that is an idealistic perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it forces one to examine &quot;How close does my &quot;personal&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allocation of resources come to an optimal allocation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would like to see for solving the problems?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am forced into a conclusion that the ExI mailing list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is pretty far from that ideal.  In large part because many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the conversations do not focus on a couple of key questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) Will my making these comments make any real difference?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) Will the comments produce some &quot;activity&quot; that results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in progress on the &quot;extropic&quot; scale (either the one I've defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for myself or your own personal scale)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you do not answer those questions before you hit the reply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; key, then I don't think you can legitimately consider oneself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extropian.  You don't have to answer the questions affirmatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but one does need to engage in some self-examination as to one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adding &quot;signal&quot; to the list or whether one is producing nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise.  And then adding &quot;signal&quot; is perhaps not enough -- is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal going to produce concrete changes in reality?  If it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce concrete changes in reality (presumably of an extropic nature)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then *why* the f*** are you wasting your time posting to this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if for any other reason to listen to oneself go mumble mumble mumble?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question is &quot;Do you merely want to be right?&quot; or &quot;Do you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see reality (really) change?&quot;.  If you want to see reality (really)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change it is probably not going to be by debates &amp; postings to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian list -- it is going to be by getting away from the extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list and discovering avenues that produce real action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My 2 cents, semi-rant mode off.
</em><br>
