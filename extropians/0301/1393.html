Rasmussen Opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Interresting exchange of views. Better understanding. Whatever a debate 
<br>
usually produces.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Unless one is a lawyer or a journalist or a salesperson, debates generally 
<br>
produce little else, but rhetoric. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The problems are similar. And the right way to fight terrorism is 
<br>
probably the same.The european terrorist often worked together with the PLO. 
<br>
That didn't make the European countries think we could solve the problem by 
<br>
bombing 
<br>
Palestinia.??&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I don't recall 3000 Europeans perishing in one stroke of a attack by the Red 
<br>
Brigades. My guess is that Europe just might have regarded at attack on the 
<br>
arabs as plasusible, until they calmed down and decided that that they liked 
<br>
the businesss opportunities, provided by Arab oil; easily worth the lives of 
<br>
a few thoudand of their fellows. Then, Is suepct, they would have vented 
<br>
their wrath on the Jews, who are a much safer target. That, then would have 
<br>
resulted in other problems, and that's another story.
