animal models of PD, the neurotoxin MPTP is used to cause PD. Selegiline

Abstract
Selegiline, a selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), was one of
the first adjunct therapies in clinical neurology. A retrospective analysis
of data from patients with Parkinson's disease found a significant increase
in survival in those treated with selegiline plus L-dopa compared with
L-dopa alone. The mechanism of action of selegiline is complex and cannot be
explained solely by its MAO-B inhibitory action. Pretreatment with
selegiline can protect neurons against a variety of neurotoxins, such as
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 6-hydroxydopamine,
N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4),
methyl-beta-acetoxyethyl-2-chloroethylamine (AF64A), and
5,6-dihydroxyserotonin, which damage dopaminergic, adrenergic, cholinergic,
and sertoninergic neurons, respectively. Selegiline produces an
amphetamine-like effect, enhances the release of dopamine, and blocks the
reuptake of dopamine. It stimulates gene expression of L-aromatic amino acid
decarboxylase, increases striatal phenylethylamine levels, and activates
dopamine receptors. Selegiline reduces the production of oxidative radicals,
up-regulates superoxide dismutase and catalase, and suppresses nonenzymatic
and iron-catalyzed autooxidation of dopamine. Selegiline compensates for
loss of target-derived trophic support, delays apoptosis in serum-deprived
cells, and blocks apoptosis-related fall in the mitochondrial membrane
potential. Most of the aforementioned properties occur independently of
selegiline's efficacy to inhibit MAO-B.

Abstract
In clinical studies the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline appears to slow the
progression of neurological deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the
cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD).  The mechanisms of action
remain unclear. Several lines of evidence indicate an immune-mediated
pathophysiology of PD and AD. According to animal trials, selegiline
increases the survival rate of immune suppressed mice.  Stimulation of the
immune response to bacterial or viral infection or in chronic inflammatory
processes in managed by an increased synthesis of the cytokines
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and subsequent interleukin-6 (IL-6). Outcome
of viral or bacterial infections in the brain highly correlates with levels
of the cytotoxic cytokine tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF).  The aim of our
study was to characterize the influence of selegiline on the biosynthesis of
IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
from healthy blood donors. After isolation and washing PBMC were cultured
without and with selegiline in three different concentrations (0.01 mumol/l,
0.001 mumol/l, 0.0001 mumol/l) in a humidified atmosphere (7% CO2).  Then
cultures were centrifuged and supernatants were collected for IL-1 beta,
IL-6 and TNF ELISA-assays.  Treatment of cultured PBMC with various
concentrations induced an increased synthesis of IL-1 beta (ANOVA F = 9.703,
p = 0.0007), IL-6 (ANOVA F = 20.648, p = 0.0001) and a reduced production of
TNF (ANOVA F = 3.770, p = 0.040).  These results indicate, that the
influence of selegiline on the cytokine biosynthesis may also contribute to
its putative neuroprotective properties.
The pharmacology of (-)deprenyl
Birkmayer J
J Neural Transm Suppl 1986; 22:75-89
ABSTRACT
(-)Deprenyl (Selegilinum hydrochloricum, Jumex, Eldepryl) developed in the
early sixties as a new spectrum, potent, irreversible MAO blocker (Knoll et
al., 1965) was introduced as the first selective inhibitor of B-type MAO
(Knoll and Magyar, 1972).  In striking contrast to MAO inhibitors which
strongly potentiate the pressor effect of tyramine, (-)deprenyl was
described to inhibit the tyramine-induced release of noradrenaline in
vascular smooth muscle (Knoll et al., 1968).  The peculiar pharmacological
spectrum of (-)deprenyl allowed its use as an adjuvant to the levodopa
therapy of Parkinson's disease (for review see Birkmayer and Riederer,
1985). Levodopa therapy revolutionized the medication of Parkinson's
disease, but severe side-effects forced the search for adjuvants with a
levodopa-sparing effect. Peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors are now
efficiently used for this purpose. It was reasonable to expect further
potentiation and prolongation of the effect of levodopa in parkinsonians
with concurrent administration of MAO inhibitors.  A number of irreversible
inhibitors of this type were tested in combination with levodopa, and
potentiation of the antiakinetic effect of the latter was demonstrated;
however, the supervention of distressing side-effect (greatly increased
involuntary movements, hypertensive reactions, toxic delirium) terminated
any further work along this line. There was a concensus that to give MAO
inhibitors concurrently with levodopa was contra-indicated. This conclusion
was called in question, however, by the development of deprenyl. (-)Deprenyl
is a safe MAO inhibitor which can be given concurrently with levodopa and a
peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor for the long run without the supervention
of any distressing side-effects.  For details regarding the pharmacology of
(-)deprenyl we refer a number of reviews (Knoll 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982,
1983, 1986).  The aim of this paper is to give a brief survey of the most
important experimental data which demonstrate that (-)deprenyl facilitates
dopaminergic tone in the brain in a peculiar manner and gives a satisfactory
explanation for the observation that long-term (-)deprenyl treatment
prolongs the life span of Parkinsonian patients significantly (Birkmayer et
al., 1985).

receptor-mediated toxicity in vitro

ABSTRACT
L-Deprenyl is a relatively selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B
that delays the emergence of disability and the progression of signs and
symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Experimentally, deprenyl has also been
shown to prevent neuronal cell death in various models through a mechanism
that is independent of MAO-B inhibition.  We examined the effect of deprenyl
on cultured mesencephalic dopamine neurons subjected to daily changes of
feeding medium, an experimental paradigm that causes neuronal death
associated with activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors.  Both
deprenyl (0.5-50 microM) and the NMDA receptor blocker MK-801 (10 microM)
protected dopamine neurons from damage caused by medium changes. The
nonselective MAO inhibitor pargyline (0.5-50 microM) was not protective,
indicating that protection by deprenyl was not due to MAO inhibition.
Deprenyl (50 microM) also protected dopamine neurons from delayed
neurotoxicity caused by exposure to NMDA. Because deprenyl had no inhibitory
effect on NMDA receptor binding, it is likely that deprenyl protects from
events occurring downstream from activation of glutamate receptors.  As
excitotoxic injury has been implicated in neurodegeneration, it is possible
that deprenyl exerts its beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease by
suppressing excitotoxic damage.
