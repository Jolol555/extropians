<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oil prices in a free Iraq world would be around $10/bbl.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They are currently around $30/bbl, partly due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restriction on Iraqi oil exports, partly on the Venezuelan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; civil conflict (which can also be traced to left wing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; organizations), and partly on global uncertainty over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future US actions in Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike/Lee I simply cannot accept this premise (sorry).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The price of oil is subject to a complex &quot;present value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis&quot; of both the countries producing it and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumers.  It comes down to a question of &quot;do I gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more by pumping the oil or leaving it in the ground?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Who ever gains more by leaving it the ground?  (Besides
<br>
U.S. farmers, I mean.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to assume that (a) the U.S. (or Europe) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act to pump-up-the volume with respect to Iraqi oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production (and there is no useful knowledge with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to the degree they could do that given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade of decay in the production capabilities) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the (b) the Saudis (or other OPEC or even non-OPEC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members) would not act in a way to offset the production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase that Iraq *might* be able to achieve.
</em><br>
<p>What?  If we assume that Iraqi oil production goes up,
<br>
then you are saying that this would be offset by other
<br>
countries *lowering* their production?  Leaving all the
<br>
profits to Iraq?  That's not how markets work.  Unless
<br>
they achieve a cartel, it forces down the world market
<br>
price of oil, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, there are disruptions, e.g. Venezuela or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pipelines being blown up (or not built due to political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems), etc.  But you are living in a fantasy world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you think most oil producing nations are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pump oil at $10/bbl).  They *know* the supply will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually decline.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and as the resource &quot;eventually&quot; runs out, the price
<br>
indeed goes up.  But it goes up in accordance with the
<br>
laws of supply and demand.  Don't you acknowledge that
<br>
the Saudis and everyone else are trying to make as much
<br>
money as they can?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are also in primarily state run companies that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not subject to the quarterly dictates of Wall Street.
</em><br>
<p>;-)  Is that what you call the law of supply and demand?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So their focus is on &quot;how do I preserve my job?&quot;.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is very different in each political situation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the rulers want the $$$$$.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I would suggest that if you think every oil minister
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will continue to do exactly what they are doing now if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq bumps its production from say 2M to 4M BBL (these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are hypothetical numbers which one would need to verify)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you are living in fantasy land.
</em><br>
<p>Why, no.  Of course they'll have to change their behavior.
<br>
They'll either have to lower their price or sell less.
<br>
<p>Lee
