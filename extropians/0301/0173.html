J. Hughes writes (and fails to appropriately attribute Eliezer)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; *Before* the fact, and only before the fact, a parent has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; responsibility to give birth to the best possible child, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the highest potential and greatest probability of happiness.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Your position is perfectly consistent with the majority of bioethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only people who argue for equal rights for the unborn are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) Catholics who argue on the basis of potential for personhood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) the disability rights hardliners who implicitly argue that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection against disability... is a crime against those future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disabled people.
</em><br>
<p>Here it is the Catholics who had it right.  The &quot;disability rights&quot;
<br>
hardliners maintain that if the choice is between a disabled person
<br>
and a non-disabled person being instantiated, then they prefer the
<br>
former.  Personally, I disagree with them, but it may come down to
<br>
who should decide, and whether a disabled person should have the
<br>
legal right to conceive another disabled person.  At moments like
<br>
this I tend to lose my temper and shout WHOSE BUSINESS IS IT ANYWAY?
<br>
<p>That patterns already exist is something which doesn't come
<br>
easily to even most 21st century people.  Greg Egan, in
<br>
&quot;Permutation City&quot; raised consciousness on this topic as
<br>
so often science fiction writers are the first to do.  With
<br>
his &quot;Theory of Dust&quot;, he helps to prepare minds for the idea
<br>
that whether a pattern exists on in computer memory, or on
<br>
disk, or on paper cards, or in a biological organism, or at
<br>
certain places in intergalactic space in the form of dust
<br>
particles, doesn't matter a whit.  Patterns are forever.
<br>
<p>To illustrate, consider the integer
<br>

23091407...
<br>
<p>which by a most transparent cipher reads
<br>
<p>&quot;Hello my name is Lee Corbin.  Yes I am an integer
<br>
but my pattern is that of a real person existing
<br>
on Earth 2003 AD.  I am less than a google long
<br>
but still as you will see there is no doubt that
<br>
I am he.  I have his DNA, his memories, his beliefs
<br>
and personality dispositions.  Consult the weighty
<br>
table of contents directly following...&quot;
<br>
<p>A particular integer of this class exists as certainly
<br>
as does the number 17, and like 17 has many objective
<br>
properties.  That this integer is not as *manifest*
<br>
to human intelligence as the number 17 doesn't change
<br>
the reality.
<br>
<p>Why should some strings such as the above get run time
<br>
and not others?  More importantly, who should decide?
<br>
The answers are clear if you cast away ancient prejudices
<br>
and try to be logical.
<br>
<p>Lee
