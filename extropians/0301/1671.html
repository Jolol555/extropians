The most remarkable thing in this piece is that the editors of the NYTimes
<br>
let the horrible &quot;effect-for-affect&quot; gaffe slip through. Th barbarians are

truly at the gates. Sigh.

<p>Red Light, Green Light: A 2-Tone L.E.D. to Simplify Screens
<br>
<p>By IAN AUSTEN
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/technology/circuits/30next.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/technology/circuits/30next.html</a>
<br>
<p>T started in the Netherlands with work on organic light-emitting diodes, or
<br>
O.L.E.D.'s, the glowing electronic devices made with plastics rather than
<br>
silicon and other traditional semiconductors.
<br>
<p>J. W. Hofstraat, the head of the polymers and organic chemistry section at
<br>
Philips Research, was trying to make O.L.E.D.'s that would be brighter by
<br>
generating nearly all of their light within the visible spectrum. Steve
<br>
Welter, a graduate student at the University of Amsterdam, where Dr.
<br>
Hofstraat teaches, was given the job of testing various experimental
<br>
O.L.E.D.'s created by the Philips group. That is when the unexpected
<br>
happened.
<br>
<p><p>During a routine test, Mr. Welter found that the sample O.L.E.D.'s could
<br>
glow either green or red. The notion that one diode could produce two colors
<br>
was so alien that Dr. Hofstraat and his colleagues did not at first accept
<br>
the student's report. &quot;We had to see it ourselves, let me put it that way,&quot;
<br>
Dr. Hofstraat said. &quot;We were rather surprised.&quot;
<br>
<p>Organic light-emitting diodes are relatively new and have so far been used
<br>
in relatively simple displays. Philips, for example, uses an O.L.E.D.
<br>
display on an electric razor.
<br>
<p>But organic diodes have several potential advantages over the liquid crystal
<br>
displays now used in computers and mobile telephones. To start with,
<br>
O.L.E.D.'s can be printed on plastic, even flexible sheets. O.L.E.D.
<br>
displays also use less power and produce brighter images. Several companies,
<br>
including Toshiba, Sony, Eastman Kodak and Sanyo, have built prototype
<br>
full-color displays with organic diodes.
<br>
<p>&quot;With O.L.E.D.'s you can roll up your display and put it in your pocket and
<br>
it weighs an ounce, not a pound,&quot; said Stephen R. Forrest a professor of
<br>
electrical engineering at Princeton and an O.L.E.D. researcher.
<br>
<p>Philips's discovery could further enhance the charms of O.L.E.D.'s for
<br>
display makers. Among other things, it may permit full-color screens that
<br>
use only a repeating pattern of elements in pairs. (Current displays,
<br>
including liquid crystal screens, use elements in groups of three, that is,
<br>
red, green and blue). Researchers believe that the discovery could lead to
<br>
three-color organic diodes that switch between red, green and blue, further
<br>
simplifying screen construction and increasing brightness.
<br>
<p>Other research groups have built O.L.E.D.'s with complex structures that can
<br>
produce two or more colors. But George G. Malliaras, an assistant professor
<br>
of materials science and engineering who heads an organic semiconductor
<br>
group at Cornell University, said that the simplicity of the Philips
<br>
discovery sets it apart. &quot;This is very exciting,&quot; Dr. Malliaras said. &quot;These
<br>
are the best discoveries: a student does something and discovers a new
<br>
physical phenomena.&quot;
<br>
<p>While Dr. Hofstraat is still studying the fundamental nature of his two-tone
<br>
O.L.E.D.'s, making them change color could not be easier. The color changes
<br>
from red to green (or, in subsequent models, between any two primary colors)
<br>
when the direction of the electrical current running through it is reversed.
<br>
<p>Making the O.L.E.D.'s is also simple, at least in comparison with the
<br>
manufacture of silicon semiconductors. Like many organic semiconductors, the
<br>
dual color Philips models are created by spraying their plastic solution out
<br>
of specially designed ink jet printers.
<br>
<p>The magic ingredient giving the Philips O.L.E.D.'s their color-switching
<br>
ability is a solution of a metal known as dinuclear ruthenium. Originally,
<br>
the researchers mixed it into the O.L.E.D. plastic to boost the amount of
<br>
visible, rather than infrared, light that the diode creates while glowing
<br>
red.
<br>
<p>When Dr. Hofstraat studied Mr. Welter's finding, he observed that when the
<br>
current headed in one direction through the diode, it excited the metal
<br>
additive and created a red glow. When the direction was reversed, it was the
<br>
plastic's turn to be excited by the voltage and the device glowed green. (A
<br>
paper about the group's discovery appeared in the Jan. 2 issue of the
<br>
journal Nature.)
<br>
<p>So far, Dr. Hofstraat said, tests have shown that the added metal does not
<br>
effect the life span of the O.L.E.D.'s. He anticipates that it will take
<br>
three to five years to produce displays with the color-switching diodes.
<br>
<p>Two-color O.L.E.D.'s offer increased brightness in a couple of ways. Because
<br>
they are created with printers, the O.L.E.D.'s can be very large. As a
<br>
result, a simple display like a warning sign that must change from green to
<br>
red could theoretically be made with one giant color-changing diode.
<br>
<p>On a sophisticated computer display, a grid made with a repeating pattern of
<br>
paired elements, whether diodes or the elements in an L.C.D., allows more of
<br>
the screen to be lighted more of the time than a display using groups of
<br>
three elements. When an L.C.D. on a laptop is displaying the color red, for
<br>
example, just a third of its elements are letting light through. All of the
<br>
blue and green elements are dark. But a screen based on two-color diodes
<br>
could have all of them lit up when displaying a single primary color.
<br>
<p>The ideal, of course, would be a diode that emits all three primary colors.
<br>
And Dr. Malliaras at Cornell said that the Philips discovery offered, at
<br>
least in theory, some new ways to do that. He suggested that it might be
<br>
possible to trigger a third color from a variation of the diode that would
<br>
use a second, higher voltage in addition to the reversing current.
<br>
<p>Dr. Forrest at Princeton has already developed an O.L.E.D.-based pixel that
<br>
can display all three primary colors. Rather than use an inkjet printer, he
<br>
makes his O.L.E.D.'s with thin films created using vacuum deposition, a
<br>
process in which the coating material is heated and evaporated in a high
<br>
vacuum and condenses on the chilled surface of the material to be coated.
<br>
His full-color diode is a carefully constructed stack of three thin film
<br>
diodes, one for each of the primary colors. The technology is licensed to
<br>
the Universal Display Corporation of Ewing, N.J.
<br>
<p>Dr. Malliaras said that potential problems that might derail either system.
<br>
Creating the sandwich of diodes in the Princeton three-color system, he
<br>
said, makes manufacturing difficult. To make sophisticated displays with the
<br>
Philips two-color O.L.E.D., he added, extensive work will be needed to
<br>
create electronics that switch pixels on and off. Fully assessing the
<br>
Philips two-color diode is difficult because its basic properties are not
<br>
completely grasped, he added.
<br>
<p>But Dr. Malliaras said the questions raised by the Philips finding were
<br>
helpful. &quot;It simply shows that although there has been a lot of research in
<br>
the field of organic light-emitting devices, there are still issues that are
<br>
not fully understood,&quot; he said.
