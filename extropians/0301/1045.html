<p>
I'm not going to get into the Samantha/Mike/Emlyn war/no-war
<br>
rhetoric.
<br>
<p>I'll simply try to put a little personal spin on this from an &quot;extropic&quot;
<br>
perspective.  One of my neighbors recently posted a &quot;No Iraq War&quot;
<br>
sign on their front lawn (these are very popular in Seattle which
<br>
is generally a green/pacifist haven).
<br>
<p>I've been thinking about how one (I?) might respond to this.
<br>
<p>I like rhetorical discussions, so I'm thinking about posting
<br>
a sign saying:
<br>
<p>1) How many Iranians died due to the will of Saddam Husein?
<br>
2) How many Kuwaitis were killed or raped due to the will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Saddam Husein?
<br>
3) How many Iraqis (i.e. his own citizens) were killed due to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the will of Saddam Husein?
<br>
4) Would you be comfortable with a person like Sadaam Husein
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walking the streets of your neighborhood?
<br>
5) If you are unwilling to have Saddam Husein living next to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you then why are you comfortable having him live next to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human beings like you in Baghdad?
<br>
<p>You may recall back a year or more ago, when I suggested what
<br>
I thought was a perfectly reasonable (utilitarian) solution in
<br>
the wake of 911 which was to nuke Afghanistan so as to completely
<br>
eliminate it as a potential source of unextropic vectors.  I was
<br>
soundly whacked in the side of the head for even considering such
<br>
an option.  Here is the key point -- I was at least considering
<br>
the utilitarian perspective (e.g. the needs of the many outweigh
<br>
the needs of the few).
<br>
<p>When you are thinking about Saddam &amp; Iraq you seriously have to
<br>
ask yourself whether one even gets up to that level (i.e. a
<br>
utilitarian tradeoff).  We are talking about a country with
<br>
a population of only 24 million people and the 2nd largest
<br>
proven oil reserves (~112+ billion barrels) in the world.
<br>
Unless I'm doing my math wrong, that suggests that each
<br>
Iraqi citizen is worth ~$140,000 dollars (less production
<br>
costs).  Why are not *all* Iraqis living in &quot;palaces&quot;?
<br>
<p>I will throw down the gauntlet here.  I will assert that
<br>
Saddam Husein is a demonstrably unextropic vector (to
<br>
the degree that he destroys the citizens of other countries
<br>
and holds back the development and advancement of the citizens
<br>
of Iraq.)
<br>
<p>I am not fond of Bush, his politics, his strategies, etc.
<br>
In my opinion he is largely a turkey.  *But* that should
<br>
not color the issue of whether or not Saddam is a really
<br>
bad actor who should be removed from the stage.  Then the
<br>
debate becomes how best to accomplish that.
<br>
<p>(Side note to Emlyn -- I believe we may be dealing with as
<br>
bad or worse actors in North Korea so there are some significant
<br>
prioritization concerns.)
<br>
<p>This problem isn't going to go away.  I think if the non-U.S.
<br>
people on the list will review the history -- the U.S. did
<br>
by and large try to stay out of both WWI and WWII.  That
<br>
approach did not work.  Furthermore, I think if one examines
<br>
the death tolls in those wars (e.g. the trench warfare or
<br>
the holocaust) one will observe that &quot;doing nothing&quot; is
<br>
essentially writing a prescription for millions of deaths.
<br>
<p>So, to all &quot;extropians&quot;, I ask this question --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;how do we prevent millions of deaths?&quot;
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p>[Side-note -- if you think this problem will go away then you
<br>
have really not studied population numbers (muslims vs.
<br>
christians), growth rates, and resources and allocations, e.g. oil
<br>
and water.  Unless the singularity occurs very very soon, it
<br>
will get much much worse before it gets better.]
