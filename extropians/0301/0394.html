<p><em>&gt; the &quot;administrations of Ronald Reagan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and George H.W. Bush authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous items that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had both military and civilian applications, including poisonous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as anthrax and bubonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plague.&quot;  If this is true
</em><br>
<p>It almost certainly is true.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; then should not also the people behind these
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; transfers be punished for putting America in danger?
</em><br>
<p>In retrospect it turned out to be a very bad idea, but I don't know of any
<br>
law that was violated.
