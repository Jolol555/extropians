<em>&gt; <a href="mailto:thespike@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Noam%20Chomsky%20(was%20RE:%20join%20The%20American%20Peace%20Movement)">thespike@earthlink.net</a> writes: in this century the United States probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murdered about 583,000 people... conceivable even as many as 1,641,000 all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told. Virtually all of these were foreigners killed during foreign wars. &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        When you say we murdered these people are you saying we sent something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like death squads out to actually murder these people or are you referring to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people killed in defensive wars or wars to aid friends that were defending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves?  If you are referring to offensive wars to gain land please 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicate the land gained and the actual number of people killed to obtain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that land.

<em>&gt; Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>False dichotomy: force is not used only to either steal land or protect
<br>
land.  It can also be, and often is, used to support one regime over a
<br>
competing one within a land, where there is no clear way to determine
<br>
which regime is &quot;legitimate&quot;.
<br>
<p>If a repressive government is in power in a country, and asks for our
<br>
help to suppress a competing faction, then we are engaging in offensive
<br>
use of force against the people of that country, even if it can be
<br>
justified in international-law-speak as &quot;defense&quot;.
<br>
<p>When most American foreign policy was established, the only actors
<br>
with the wherewithal to pose a real threat to us were governments,
<br>
and so it was in our interest to support those foreign governments
<br>
that were friendly to us, regardless of what was right or wrong, or
<br>
what was in the interests of the people of those lands.  But times
<br>
have changed.  Small groups of people can now do serious damage, and
<br>
it is important now that our foreign policy deal with the /people/
<br>
of other lands with integrity and fairness, even if that means
<br>
pissing off the repressive-but-friendly-to-US-interests government
<br>
they may live under.
