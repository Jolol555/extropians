<em>&gt; If that's the incident that I'm remembering, there were disputes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; territorial waters, and where the boundaries were.  (We didn't agree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they had the right to put the boundaries where they said they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did.)  So it isn't exactly unprovoked.  Also (again if it's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incident 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I'm remembering) the ship was there in (indirect) support of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Israel.  I don't remember if they were officially at war or not, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they certainly weren't friendly.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it wasn't in support of Israel, it was in support of Kuwait
<br>
and Saudi oil producers, who reflagged their tankers in the US so they
<br>
could be afforded US Navy protection from the anti-ship warfare both
<br>
Iraq and Iran were practicing during their war with each other, trying
<br>
to hurt each other's ability to earn money for the war.
<br>
<p>Ohm and as I recall, there were I think 27 dead.
<br>
<p>We did not provoke Iraq in that incident. Specifically, Iraq said they
<br>
were our friend and agreed not to attack US flagged vessels. They then
<br>
ran not one, but TWO execet missiles into our ship. &quot;oh, so solly, our
<br>
mistake...&quot;
<br>
<p>The Iranians were no better, they deliberately flew an airliner full of
<br>
people on a collision course with one of our ships (not just passing
<br>
over, but on a bombing trajectory).
