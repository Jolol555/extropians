John K. Clark asked:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;But it doesn't always happen like that. Israel has fought 4 major wars and
<br>
countless smaller batters with the Arabs in the last 55 years and has won
<br>
every one, usually by a huge margin, but Arabs are still killing Jews. For
<br>
those who want to give reasons why the war might not be a good idea this is
<br>
the avenue to explore, forget about Bush's motivation and nonsense like
<br>
Saddam's right to remain dictator. I want to know after the war is won will
<br>
Iraq fracture into chaos like Yugoslavia did.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Arabs are still killing Jews, in large part because of the Oslo Accords, and 
<br>
Israel's withdrawal from South Lebanon. Apparently, Arafat and Sheik Yassin 
<br>
(head of Hamas) were thrilled by &quot;hezzbollah's success in driving the 
<br>
zionists out!&quot;  Please not that Hezbollah has threatened to attack Israel 
<br>
with newly supplied, longer-ranged rockets, if the US attacks Iraq. These 
<br>
rockets were delivered by Syria, and given by Iran.
<br>
<p>You mentioned Iraq becoming another Yugoslavia. I note that the first 
<br>
Yugoslavian war 1991 was a 3-way struggle between the Serbs, the Croats, and 
<br>
the Muslims. The 2nd Yugoslav war 1995, was a war between Albanians (Muslims) 
<br>
and Serbians. The US, Canada, and the UK,  jumped in on this war and aerially 
<br>
attacked Serbian forces and brought the war to a halt. Europe finally got 
<br>
involved with using temporary Peacekeeping Police patrols.  My point relates 
<br>
to the above paragraph that attacks will cease against Israel, by the Arabs 
<br>
when there is total separation of peoples.
<br>
<p>This implies, no Arabs in Israel, and no Jews in Arab territory-separation. 
<br>
The general peace we NOW have in Yugoslavia, however repugnant, seems to work 
<br>
this way. The Serbians gambled that if they started this war in 1991, they 
<br>
would still maintain political control of the geography of Yugoslavia--bad 
<br>
bet!  So Milosevich, with his &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; won in principle, but lost 
<br>
big time on the practical. Actually,  Milosevich made it impossible for any 
<br>
co-mixing of peoples, due to his massacres, and thus, forcing everyone to 
<br>
chose sides.
<br>
<p>As for Iraq, I suspect that there may be too much oil wealth involved to 
<br>
suffer ethnic massacres. There will likely be a surfeit of French volunteers 
<br>
to keep the Kurds and Shiites quiet, so oil can be pumped. Perhaps Russians 
<br>
also, so as to get their 12 Billion in cashola, that Saddam owes them. 
<br>
<p>That's my take, or rant on world events anyway.
