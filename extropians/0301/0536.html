<p>Polymers are used in ablative heat shields in aerospace. I see no reason
<br>
why you can't have polymers performing adequately sustainably at 1000 K. I
<br>
would count any molecular crystal as polymer, so diamond and graphite are
<br>
polymers too.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; You're up against a pretty fundamental limit of materials, I suspect: any

</em><br>
<p>So don't use hydrocarbon polymers.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Conceivable that, after forming, you could heat-drive the hydrogen off

</em><br>
<p>Do you remember that orthogonally aligned bucky reinforced polymer is on 
<br>
par with metal carbides like TiC and WC, at orders of magnitude less 
<br>
density? I don't know about thermal stability, but the matrix could be 
<br>
essentially anything. I could see them surviving abovementioned 1 kK.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Now, if you consider _diamond_ a polymer... :)
</em><br>
<p>Of course diamond is a polymer. But we should be able to do better than 
<br>
diamond, as far as thermal stability in oxidative environments is 
<br>
concerned.

<em>&gt; Sintering metals or ceramics seems superficially plausible, but I'd guess

</em><br>
<p>Next generation DVD lasers have 400 mW output. Plenty heat, if focused 
<br>
down to um sized spots.

<em>&gt; For me, that leaves hypotech such as [s]elf-assembling ([Sic], given the monicker
