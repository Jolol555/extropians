<em>&gt; &quot;So far Bush is doing a very poor job convincing anybody that he is morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right in attacking Irak. Especially the arab countries are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced it is all just a ploy to get cheap oil. Exactly the situation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned Osama and many other arabs against the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; USA. So how can that be a long term solution?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that Sadam is a murderous racist tyrant despotic dictator is moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification enough.  
</em><br>
<p>With no or little consequences and death to only him and his 
<br>
direct guard and troops that *might* be enough.  But this is far 
<br>
from the case.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The fact that Europeans do not find this as a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification is a testament to the liberalized moral relativist notions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevalent in Europe at the moment.  
</em><br>
<p>This is nothing but empty rhetoric.  The latest polls show that 
<br>
70% of the American people believe we should not use military 
<br>
means at this time, that we should give more time to inspections 
<br>
and diplomatic means.  Of course you can make your empty 
<br>
accusations against them also.  But at some point you really 
<br>
need to notice that a great deal of the world and of US people 
<br>
do not believe this is the correct course of action.  Call them 
<br>
whatever names you will, the numbers are against you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also seem to be oblivious of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that this murderous racist tyrant also controls the worlds second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest supply of the cheapest and dense sources of energy in the world, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprisingly he has used it for murder and tyranny.  This is NOT about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'cheap' oil so evil oil companies can profit, its about getting the cheapest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most plentiful source of energy, in fact the second largest depository of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, out of the hands of a murderous despotic tyrant.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>He hasn't been able to do much of squat with that oil for the 
<br>
last decade in case you missed it.  There are many murderous 
<br>
despotic tyrants in the world.  Why do we go after this one in 
<br>
particular at this time?  Are you sure oil and positioning US 
<br>
forces don't have at least something to do with it?
