</em><br>
<p>Is that necessarily the case? Certainly your state would decohere from those
<br>
where you chose a different set of numbers. I'd been thinking of the choice
<br>
as, finally, a 0/1 decision: my selected numbers = 1, any other result = 0.
<br>
Of course all those n million universes must differ minimally at the moment
<br>
when the macroscopic randomizer tumbles and selects its six balls. (In fact,
<br>
maybe this is never a suitable case for MWI, since perhaps there's no
<br>
quantum-level contribution to the outcome, which always happens the same way
<br>
in all `adjacent' universes? If so, we do have to adopt a `quantum Lotto'
<br>
generator for this gedanken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as I understand things, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would get the fringes change as if the probability amplitude of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially blocked photon was decreased (how much depends on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setup). So for a very unlikely blocking you would get the fringes nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as in the typical two-slit experiment, and for a more likely blocking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would move towards a no-fringe pattern.
</em><br>
<p>That's one of the points I remain unclear about. In the Deutsch formulation,
<br>
interference occurs because of the interplay between measurable photons
<br>
(etc) and their `shadow' other-world counterparts (which I sometimes think
<br>
of, provincially, as `fauxtons'). If this actually happens, I suppose a
<br>
reduced number of worlds with the 2 slits open should cause reduced rather
<br>
than obliterated fringes. But I was under the impression that experiments
<br>
(either real or gedanken) by Chiao and colleagues had shown that even *in
<br>
principle* slit closure was enough to block interference. (Serafino kindly
<br>
sent me some references to, e.g., interaction-free measurements --
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0102/0102049.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/quant-ph/pdf/0102/0102049.pdf</a> -- etc, which are
<br>
damaging my brain even as we speak.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You still need the photons to get to the photographic film to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something measurable, so they will have to take the day to pass down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beam path.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I guess so, in which case there's no obvious way to *use* such an
<br>
effect. Sigh. (Unless Elitzur/Vaidman etc, cited above, helps out...)
