<em>&gt; A prime example is Nigeria.  This is a country whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom is being eroded.  Right now they cannot even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; host a beauty contest.  Freedom of speech and freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the press are functionally gone.  Im a big fan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of democracy, but I can scarcely blame the minority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for fighting like hell against the oppression and loss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of freedom.  spike
</em><br>
<p>The tyranny of the majority is alive and well, and armed to the teeth.
<br>
<p>I'm a big fan of representative government in preference to, say,
<br>
living under a Bokassa or an Amin or a Pol Pot, but I stopped being
<br>
a big fan of pure-d &quot;democracy&quot;, applied willy-nilly... about 25
<br>
or 30 years ago.
<br>
<p>Without a bunch of norms of fair play, or checks and balances, or
<br>
both--in other words, without some sort of &quot;governor&quot;, in the
<br>
steam-engine-flyball-valve-sense--democracy winds down/up as &quot;Let's
<br>
you and me kill Fred and take his stuff&quot; pretty durned fast. Not
<br>
quite as spectacular to see the steam engine throw intself apart
<br>
as it is to see a boiler explosion, but it's bad news just the same.
<br>
<p>Absent &quot;meddling by outsiders in our sovereign internal affairs&quot;,
<br>
(attempted) insurgency is a predictable consequence, as is blood feud,
<br>
as is genocide. This stuff is happening in many places in Africa, as
<br>
well as elsewhere. I would have picked Rwanda as a perfect example
<br>
of democracy gone rotten, but there are plenty of examples to choose from.
<br>
<p>A pity most outsider meddling is of such desultory quality.
<br>
<p>Also a pity that in such extremity, simple platitudes about arms control
<br>
fall dully on the graves of the slaughtered minority--always. Machetes.
<br>
Hundreds of thousands hacked to death with machetes.
<br>
<p>Oh brave new world, that hath such democracies in't.
<br>
<p>ObExtro: This is not a g*n thread.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>It takes a village to burn a witch. Oh, and remember to put her head in a bag.
