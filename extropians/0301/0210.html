<p>
In another thread the question arose as to whether existence is
<br>
better than non-existence, particularly for living, conscious beings.
<br>
Superficially the answer is obviously yes.  Certainly most of us look
<br>
very unfavorably upon the prospect of ceasing to exist, and presumably
<br>
we are happy to have experienced existence rather than not to have had
<br>
that chance.
<br>
<p>However there are some important philosophical arguments that suggest
<br>
that this reasoning is misguided, that existence is a much broader and
<br>
more complicated category than we naively suppose.  What does it mean for
<br>
something to exist?  Could there be forms of existence beyond the physical
<br>
objects around us that we can see and touch?  Are there worlds beyond
<br>
the reach of our senses where other forms of existence are possible?
<br>
<p>One of the more plausible extensions to &quot;reality&quot; is the many worlds
<br>
interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics.  This model, which has
<br>
gained increasing credibility among physicists in the past couple of
<br>
decades, supposes that there are parallel universes where things have
<br>
happened differently.  Any time there is a quantum measurement event,
<br>
which is uncountably many times every second, the universe in effect
<br>
splits into parts where the measurement result happens differently.
<br>
These separate worlds are all equally real, but we are only able to
<br>
perceive one among myriads.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this perspective, the question of existence vs non-existence becomes
</em><br>
more difficult because there is so much wider scope for existence.
<br>
It is hard to say which beings are non-existent, or whether in fact
<br>
non-existence is even possible.  We need to drop the boolean distinction
<br>
between existence and non-existence and instead use a continuous
<br>
measurement of the probability or &quot;measure&quot; of the existence of a
<br>
particular entity.  Arguably more measure is better, for that entity.
<br>
This step forces us to take at least a more nuanced perspective towards
<br>
these questions.
<br>
<p>An even broader answer to the question of reality goes back to Plato, who
<br>
claimed that the only true existence was for mathematical and geometric
<br>
entities.  Perfect circles, squares and cubes have a primary existence,
<br>
of which our physical world offers only a crude shadow or approximation.
<br>
<p>In modern times this idea has been generalized to the concept that a wide
<br>
range of mathematical objects have Platonic existence, independent of
<br>
our thoughts or perceptions, existence outside of our universe.  We gain
<br>
a connection to the existence of our physical world by postulating that
<br>
our minds and in fact the entire universe are just mathematical objects
<br>
of great complexity.  So instead of the universe holding minds which
<br>
create mathematics, we have mathematics on the outside, of which a subset
<br>
is universes including our own, and minds inside of those universes.
<br>
In other variants there may be &quot;bare&quot; minds that are mathematical objects
<br>
of their own which perhaps fantasize universes around them.
<br>
<p>Outlandish as this idea may seem, a number of modern thinkers are
<br>
pursuing it.  See Hans Moravec's article at
<br>
<a href="http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html">http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/~hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1998/SimConEx.98.html</a>.
<br>
Physicist &quot;Mad&quot; Max Tegmark (who had an article on the MWI in a recent
<br>
issue of Scientific American) presents his version of the idea at
<br>
<a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a>.  This page is worth looking at
<br>
as it shows a chart of all kinds of different mathematical structures
<br>
with an eye towards the kinds of complexity that an abstract mathematical
<br>
object would have to have in order to host self-aware subsystems (i.e.
<br>
living, conscious beings).
<br>
<p>Another variant is by Juergen Schmidhuber,
<br>
<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html</a>, where he proposes
<br>
that all computer programs exist and are being run.  This amounts to
<br>
much the same thing, since we can (more or less) associate computer
<br>
programs with mathematical objects.  Wei Dai has created a mailing list,
<br>
the &quot;everything-list&quot;, to discuss the theory that &quot;everything exists&quot;,
<br>
and Schmidhuber continues to contribute occasionally.
<br>
<p>Why would someone believe a crazy idea like this?  I can suggest a
<br>
couple of possibilities.  First, the MWI already forces us to seriously
<br>
consider the possibility of other universes.  I think most &quot;everythingers&quot;
<br>
do accept the MWI and are ready to look beyond it.  Second, there is a
<br>
certain simplicity to the notion.  As Schmidhuber writes in his abstract
<br>
above, &quot;Is the universe computable?  If so, it may be much cheaper in
<br>
terms of information requirements to compute all computable universes
<br>
instead of just ours.&quot;  There is actually less information needed to
<br>
specify all universes than for just a particular one.
<br>
<p>Another reason has to do with the anthropic principle.  At the Tegmark
<br>
page above he shows a diagram illustrating how carefully selected
<br>
the physical parameters of our universe have to be in order to allow
<br>
for life like ours to exist.  A tiny difference one way or the other
<br>
and we would not be here.  How can we explain this?  One answer is to
<br>
point to a creator, such as God, who has carefully selected and tuned
<br>
the parameters to allow for life to evolve.  But if we want to stick to
<br>
naturalistic explanations, another possibility is to suggest that all the
<br>
universes exist, each with its own set of parameters, and then life will
<br>
only evolve in those universes where that is possible.  It seems that
<br>
you need some foundation of multiple universes like this to invoke the
<br>
anthropic principle, otherwise it doesn't really have explanatory value.
<br>
<p>To sum up, the theory that everything exists cuts through a number of
<br>
classic philosophical problems.  It explains why our universe exists
<br>
(because everything does) and why it has the properties necessary
<br>
to support life (because of the anthropic principle).  It even allows
<br>
for the possibility that the total information content of the entire
<br>
universe of existence is zero, which is certainly not the case if only
<br>
our personal universe exists, and that is attractive philosophically
<br>
as well, and perhaps even gives the notion a certain self-bootstrapping
<br>
flavor.
<br>
<p>And to close the circle, if everything exists it doesn't make sense to ask
<br>
whether existence is better than non-existence, because there is no such
<br>
thing as non-existence.  It may still be possible to do as in the case
<br>
of the MWI and define a &quot;measure&quot; function over the entities that exist,
<br>
and then to work in terms of probabilities for these entities, in terms
<br>
of what fraction of the &quot;multiverse&quot; they occupy.  We can say that having
<br>
more measure is better than having less, and that our actions can (in a
<br>
sense) influence the measure of ourselves and the entities around us.
<br>
So there is still a foundation for actions and decisions, for taking
<br>
steps to affect the multiverse in terms of what is important to us.
