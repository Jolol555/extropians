</em><br>
<p>Well, there are more than a few people around here that believe 
<br>
in a sort of &quot;life after this one&quot; as they are determined to 
<br>
support the creation of such possibilities whether through 
<br>
cryogencis, uploading or such increase of capability without 
<br>
formally dying that the result is no longer what most would term 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;human&quot;.  Others think it quite like that we are in a sim or 
<br>
are at least &quot;players&quot; in a sim.
<br>
<p>The point of bringing this up is that belief in a life beyond 
<br>
this one, even of the more conventionally religious kind, is not 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;automatically a sign of serious psychological problems and 
<br>
limitations.  Even conventional religious folks often belief in 
<br>
and practice good stewardship of resources in this life.  Now, 
<br>
it is true that many who do believe in an &quot;afterlife&quot; and even 
<br>
some that believe in some types of techno-transcendence, 
<br>
consider things of &quot;this life&quot; of not enough importance to spend 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;much time maximizing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Belief makes for bad social policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Personally I get a little tweaked by &quot;social policy&quot;.  It smacks 
<br>
of collectivism and of centralized power and of some supposed 
<br>
limit on individual rights to come to whatever conclusions or 
<br>
beliefs by whatever methods they see fit.  It leans toward some 
<br>
duty to the collective to only think and come to conclusions in 
<br>
approved ways.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I need to get to know someone before I give them the benefit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the doubt as to having done either qualitative or quantitative analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any sort *if* they say they have arrived at a position based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith or belief.  Actually if the used the words &quot;arrived at a positon&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd probably raise my evaluation a bit. If they use another word
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  they are not just parroting what they've heard. I guess I apply a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crude sort of Turing test to people. I suspect that some others that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a strong commitment to reason also make assessments on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basis of language. Assessments which are not facts, but are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definately not mere beliefs either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why should anyone care whether you approve of the word they use 
<br>
for their process or not though?  I disagree with the 
<br>
contention, as Lee did, that &quot;belief&quot; usually means or should be 
<br>
taken to imply an unthinking acceptance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some one who does no better than to believe when reason is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available in my view is morally copping out in many cases. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of  reasoning is available to normal homo sapiens but it can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be engaged simultaneously with the process of believeing. Belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starts when reasoning stops. If indeed in some peoples cases, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many issues, reason every got out of the starting block in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The above assumes that reason alone is sufficient for all 
<br>
things.  But some quite fundamental philosophical decisions, 
<br>
such as the Primacy of Matter vs. Primacy of Consciousness, are 
<br>
not decidable on the basis of reason alone.  They are at a 
<br>
nearly axiomatic level not further reducible.  There is also the 
<br>
matter of a more inductive approach to certain questions of life 
<br>
and value.  For that matter, the entire sphere of values is not 
<br>
easily reduced to that which reason alone recommends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the extropian dumbs down his/her language in such a forum to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include the uncritical word belief and thereby justifies by implication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the view that beliefs are as good as reasons, the extropian has handed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over a large part of their natural advantage. The listener(s) hear both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extropian and the extropian's adversary talking in terms of belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and may get the message that as both sides are talking about beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they may as well choose whichever uncertainty they like. Hell vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the better looking politician, or the tall one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do not agree and it is not part of Extropian Principles that 
<br>
we are or should be limited to &quot;reasons&quot; alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; For example, people whose thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is screwed up anyway aren't going to be magically helped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;dropping a certain term and fishing around for synonyms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. To understand my point you need to see I'm thinking like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lobbyist and a political activist trying to arm my allies, not like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosopher arguing some esoteric point that doesn't really seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to matter to many people at all. I see extropian activities as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially a matter of life and death, I take memes and training in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  memes very seriously. I live in a democracy where &quot;everyone&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believers and reasoners (I'm simplifying) each get one vote. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority of votes make the law irrespective of whether belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or reason was used by each of the many voters to make their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  personal &quot;decision&quot;. There are already a swag of folk who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialise in collecting believers. I can't stop people believing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have to encourage the dumbing down of the population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is an aside that actually makes your point weaker.  If the 
<br>
point is specialized to political activism then the general 
<br>
point you make is lost.  It would be better if our democracy was 
<br>
actually a republic where the majority of people had no right at 
<br>
all to &quot;vote&quot; on a great number of things interfering with the 
<br>
freedom of individuals and groups.  That would be much more of a 
<br>
benefit to our interest than a sterile division into &quot;reasoners&quot; 
<br>
and &quot;believers&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I certainly won't willingly contribute to the view that belief is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good and as valid a way of making decisions in the world as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason. It isn't. Indeed promoting such a misconception in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy increases the chances of my premature demise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>When you have employed reason and cannot reach a conclusion but 
<br>
you have to choose, what do you do?  I expect you &quot;make a value 
<br>
judgment&quot; that at least seems unlikely to be certainly wrong and 
<br>
seems to be mostly in the direction of the rest of your values.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Please do consider ditching &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;beings&quot; from your operating language when other terms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm talking again as a political animal, not merely or mainly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical one. I am persuing change and very aware of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important it is to win the votes on issues in democracies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not important.  The votes are a game generally to persuade 
<br>
the people they actually are in control.  The counter-evidence 
<br>
is easily found.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry just in case that was missed, the pivot point on embryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stem cell research around the world at present (politically)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking is whether an embryo is a human being. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is. It exists and its human. Its not a person though. So if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want to propagate and validate the confusion we'd better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the term person and people and personhood or some such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalents when we mean them instead of the less precise terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or we are running the risk of helping believers giving us social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies whereby actually persons (sick people) cannot be given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fullest level of care, because we've traded off their rights as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a class against the rights of some potential people (embryos) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>A good point.  However, it would be MUCH better to remove stem 
<br>
cell research and development from that which is subject to a 
<br>
&quot;vote&quot;.
