<br>
that's invariably made about the role of GALAXY and some of the other 
<br>
English-language sf magazines of the fifties is their near *uniqueness* in 
<br>
standing (via allegory) against propaganda, bigotry and media silence, as was 
<br>
sf in the Soviet Union then and later.
<br>
<p>Damien,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't read Galaxy that often and wasn't aware they were 
<br>
Anti-McCarthy.  But other magazines were.  My daily paper was a conservative 
<br>
Republican (Reputedly) in St. Louis that ran a comic strip daily, in the 
<br>
early 50s, attacking ol' tailgunner Joe with great glee.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the man did have supporters.  I have read that one of his 
<br>
financial supporters was Joe Kennedy.  Certainly the two Kennedy boys were 
<br>
supporters in committee.  I suppose that Nixon supported him until 52.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However if you notice the people that openly opposed Joe M. went 
<br>
pretty much unscathed.  His power was over the timid artistic type.
<br>
