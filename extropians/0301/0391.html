<p><em>&gt; Considering your arguments on how important it is to find the

</em><br>
<p>Hi Charles, 
<br>
<p>I don't like the word believe Charles. I think it carries with it too
<br>
much religious and superstitious baggage, but yes, I could make
<br>
an assessment on the veracity of evidence and alledged evidence
<br>
as it is presented by a variety of disparate media sources and 
<br>
journalists competing for an angle, a scoop, and a new piece of
<br>
data. I think the world's press does a pretty good job of making
<br>
enough data available to those who are willing to put the time in
<br>
to critically work through it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm certain that if they decide to invade that they will announce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proofs. 
</em><br>
<p>I think its very very likely that they will. &quot;The world&quot; is in big 
<br>
trouble if &quot;they&quot; (ie. Bush and his admin, Blair and his gov,
<br>
Howard (in little Oz) and his govt ) don't. And in that order.  
<br>
<p>The UN also needs to ensure it doesn't look irrelevant, so 
<br>
they will make sure some &quot;proof&quot; is announced, or make a lot
<br>
of noise about it. And this Bush will factor. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I doubt whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proofs will be checkable independant of sources that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  benefit from their being correct. 
</em><br>
<p>Some noise is being made by the UN weapons inspectors
<br>
along the lines of come on you guys (in the US agencies) give
<br>
us the data you claim to have on where to look so we can do
<br>
our job. 
<br>
<p>Jan 27, when the UN inspectors have to make the report sets
<br>
a key data in the political landscape. If I was Bush, and had 
<br>
hard evidence, maybe I hold off on giving it to the UN 
<br>
inspectors until quite close to Jan 27 too, this would give me
<br>
the chance to get my troops lined up, get my allies sorted out 
<br>
and ready, and take away Hussein's chance of spinning and
<br>
game planning. I'd deprive him of propaganda material and 
<br>
time as best I could. He (Hussein) is getting very good at it
<br>
IMO. With this approach Bush can also cut down on the
<br>
time for non-concurring countries to lobby within the UN. 
<br>
<p>So its troops in place. Best case presented *just before* Jan 27
<br>
so Saddam and those concerned about war don't get to look
<br>
too long at the case and equivocate. Then invade. Then win the
<br>
next Presidential election. If the US needs to do a bit of economic
<br>
pump priming to ensure Bush Jnr doesn't get ejected like Bush
<br>
Snr, then politically thats the way to go (for Bush). 
<br>
<p>I'm not surprised Daschle is announcing he will not run for 
<br>
President currently, based on Bush's political strategy and 
<br>
present popularity, in his (Daschle's) position I'd wait for
<br>
another day and more fortuitous times before taking a run too. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This doesn't mean that the evidence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faked, it means that being certain that it isn't is... dubious.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not too concerned that dubious evidence will be able to
<br>
be passed off as real for too long. I hope I'm not being too 
<br>
optimistic here. If I am my optimism doesn't stem from a 
<br>
pollyanna-ish view of human goodness but from an assessment 
<br>
of how hard it is for groups of people in something as large as
<br>
say the Bush administration to keep secrets that are of strong 
<br>
political (and therefore economic interest). I was reading in the
<br>
Australian newspaper just recently that the speachwriter for 
<br>
Bush who coined the term &quot;axis of evil&quot; has since stopped 
<br>
working with Bush and has published his take on what life in
<br>
the Bush administration was actually like. He's not particularly
<br>
flattering of the intellect of those Bush has surrounded himself
<br>
&nbsp;with. Personally I don't immediately warm to the guy who
<br>
coined the term axis of evil nor see him as evidencing a 
<br>
particularly incisive mind either, so his views on the intellect or
<br>
otherwise of others, I have reservations about. For his part, he
<br>
thinks of me, not at all :-)  But my point is that large organisations
<br>
and administrations leak. And because they leak its quite hard 
<br>
to fool all the people all the time. Its not just the US govt, that's
<br>
involved here, its a lot of other democratic govts, that are going
<br>
to have to justify their own positions on Iraq to their constituents
<br>
in a climate where their oppositions will be keenly looking for 
<br>
evidence of mistakes in judgement and failure to disclose facts
<br>
in order to make political capital from these things. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Hmm. Can anyone think of any stocks that are likely to do 
<br>
better if Bush &quot;wins&quot; the next election?R
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this way it is like most of history.  Pravda, I am told,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means &quot;the official word&quot;, with a secondary meaning of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the truth&quot;. And in Egypt the Goddess Maat is called the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goddess of Truth, but was actually the goddess of &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; party line&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. I didn't know that.
