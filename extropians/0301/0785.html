<p>
One prerequisite for having a constructive discussion about a powerful
<br>
topic is to be able to handle it on a high level of abstraction. When you
<br>
know enough about a topic you can start to look at it from different
<br>
sides. You can be abstract enough about it so that you become
<br>
dispassionate. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately people tend to debate many issues they *feel* strongly
<br>
about, but do not *know* much about. Witness the Lomborg debate, for
<br>
example. On this list the problem is that people seem to think that it is
<br>
better to debate now and learn later, rather than the reverse. For a
<br>
really thoughful and constructive debate, first study the issue throughly
<br>
Just reading debunkings of your opponent's arguments isn't really study;
<br>
real study means that you learn how the field fits within the web of
<br>
human existence and how it works, what the different positions are, the
<br>
supporting evidence and methods and so on. Google is excellent for 
<br>
getting instant arguments for and against some issue, entire essays 
<br>
proving whatever you want to prove. But can you judge how good these 
<br>
essays are? That takes more than just a bit of critical reading, that 
<br>
takes understanding the subject.
<br>
<p>I think the problem here on the list is not that human nature is against
<br>
us, but simply that it is a loud cocktail party where everybody is
<br>
talking rather than the thoughtful scholarly den where many of us really
<br>
would like to be.
