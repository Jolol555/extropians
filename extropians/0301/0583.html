<p>
Australia, Canada, Japan and some EU countries are in the minority as
<br>
investing into
<br>
pure technology more extensively than pure military.
<br>
<p>The cost of negativism also includes the  rebuilding costs for economies
<br>
/physical/ecosysytem/human resource  assets of the &quot;loosing&quot; countries.
<br>
England, Germany, Korea, Russia, Vietnam, Iraq,
<br>
Afganistan,Cambodia.....  In Canada our economy has been ravaged by
<br>
economic warfare between first  socialist appeasing the &quot;threat&quot; of
<br>
French Canadian separation over the last 50 years.  As well the
<br>
aboriginal settlements are just beginning to accrue major costs to the
<br>
economic system.  The diversion of assets/resources to sustinance vs
<br>
progress is something I at least partially lump in with military &quot;death
<br>
economy&quot;.
<br>
<p>The use of numerically correct QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years)   as a
<br>
basis for dispensing life extending contemporary medical treatments is
<br>
innacurate because it does not factor in an uncertainty factor for novel
<br>
life extension factors which only work best  if the patient is pre-
<br>
treated with every leading edge treatment.
<br>
In a world where extreme life extension is a pipe dream  it doesn't
<br>
matter so much where resources go, but it seems apparent now that the
<br>
things of dreams are becoming the things of reality.
<br>
<p>The AIDS strategy comparison is a good one (<a href="mailto:reason@exratio.com?Subject=Re:%20Life%20Economy%20Vs%20Death%20Economy">reason@exratio.com</a>)
<br>
The awareness curve  that taught tht populace that there was something
<br>
in it for everybody to
<br>
undertake the AIDS battle came fairly slow.  Lets hope the longevity
<br>
extension &quot;Manhatten Project&quot; will be soon upon us with a bit less push
<br>
and shove.
