<p>
It has occurred to me, as I spiral through my various endeavors, that
<br>
there's actually quite a large potentially transhumanist online community
<br>
out there. There are a number of groups that churn out a healthy amount of
<br>
content via mailing lists, forums and websites. There is a fair degree of
<br>
isolation between different special interest groups with high transhumanist
<br>
cross-over (or cross-over potential), since most are e-mail based. The point
<br>
of separate lists is so that people don't get overwhelmed, after all.
<br>
<p>I fall into the category of people who think that if you can sort out a way
<br>
to make a bunch of like-minded people talk to each other, leaders and
<br>
actions tend to follow on as a natural consequence. More people in the group
<br>
directly correlates to better and more effective leaders and actions. I also
<br>
think that getting people who have been in previously remote tribes together
<br>
produces interesting results rapidly.
<br>
<p>I also fall into the category of people who thinks that selling/raising
<br>
awareness of transhumanism (and life extension -- I will admit to being very
<br>
much life extension first, other transhuman issues second...solve the
<br>
problem that's going to kill you before the rest of them, IMHO) is as
<br>
important at this stage as working or funding transhumanist technologies.
<br>
Money spent on raising awareness and creating demand/desire is a seed
<br>
investment in generating monies that will flow into transhumanist
<br>
technology. Few entities would be more effective at direct action than they
<br>
would in creating the atmosphere that induces many other entities to take
<br>
direct action.
<br>
<p>So I think that some form of technological community integration tool would
<br>
be very beneficial to the transhuman community at this time. The integration
<br>
between ExI boards and mailing lists is a first step in that direction, from
<br>
a technology point of view. What I have in mind would be something of the
<br>
&quot;all places are one place&quot; ilk:
<br>
<p>1) Any forum or mailing list can opt into participation
<br>
2) A central server receives all posts to that forum/mailing list and stores
<br>
them for client retrieval
<br>
3) A client is loosely integrated with each forum/mailing list: it retrieves
<br>
new posts from the central server and inserts them appropriately. I have a
<br>
fairly loose client-end-controlled scheme in mind for this that deals with
<br>
the common issues in mail/forum integration and cross-posting
<br>
(conversational timing differences, desirability of list restrictions, edge
<br>
cases, etc).
<br>
<p>This sort of arrangement can be set up without treading on toes; from the
<br>
point of view of a forum operator, it's free (and as on-topic as it gets)
<br>
traffic. There is no central other place that's benefiting without doing the
<br>
work to get a community (the central server #2 isn't a forum or list
<br>
itself). Anyone who wants to run a transhumanist forum site can just jump in
<br>
and have their users become part of the larger space. Traffic like that is
<br>
also a very slick tool for spreading our reach to more mainstream science
<br>
and futurism sites. Community is an envied property in the business and
<br>
pseudo-business web world, and so far as I see, we have everything to gain
<br>
by giving it away.
<br>
<p>I've chatted with a couple of people in the space who seem to agree with me
<br>
that this is a good idea in principal. Certainly, there are few enough high
<br>
traffic locales at the moment that custom-fitting instances of #3 above
<br>
wouldn't be too onerous. It's a project that can proceed at its own rate,
<br>
site by site once the planning is done.
<br>
<p>Feel free to comment. If any of the technical types can identify existing
<br>
open source projects that would fit the bill, that would be interesting to
<br>
note too. I suspect I'll be building it from scratch, however, once my Q1
<br>
obligations are out of the way and assuming I get buy-in from the relevant
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>Speaking of buy-in, this would be a good time to hear any major objections,
<br>
to -- say -- a hypothetical integration of communities from:
<br>
<p>betterhumans.com
<br>
crsociety list
<br>
cryonet list
<br>
ExI BBS
<br>
extropians list
<br>
imminst.org
<br>
longevitymeme.org
<br>
wta-talk list
<br>
transhumantech list
<br>
<p>into something that's very much more tied together than it is now. (I should
<br>
note I haven't talked to the owners of most of them...this is just being
<br>
thrown out there).
