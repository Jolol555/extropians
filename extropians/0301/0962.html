Damien Broderick:
<br>
<em>&gt; Here's a half-baked notion I put up for demolition or development:
</em><br>
<p>In general MWI is 'useful' as a tool, a gedanken interpretation.
<br>
Unfortunately there are many MWI. So you have to choose your own.
<br>
(In other worlds I already chose different interpretations.)
<br>
<p>The best one, but I'm not an expert, states that those worlds
<br>
interfere untill measurements are performed. When measurements
<br>
are performed the splitting (branching) occurs.
<br>
<p>Thus, in our world, in a double slit set-up, the branching occurs
<br>
when we observe what is going on. If we make an early observation
<br>
we cause the branching and we do not get the interference pattern.
<br>
<p>I.e. if we observe the electron going through slit one, we can not
<br>
observe the second (real, eh!) electron going through slit two.
<br>
<p>To observe, of course, means to use an (irreversible) device which
<br>
can tell you 'which path','which slit'.
<br>
<p>Before observation there is no MWI, because there are no 'relative'
<br>
states. (Here I suppose that 'osbervation' and 'measurement' are
<br>
the same thing.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You agree to open the shutter at 8 pm on the day of the next Lotto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draw iff the winning numbers are 3, 15, 27, 28, 31 and 45.
</em><br>
<p>Here you mean a quantum Lotto, I suppose.
<br>
<p>Of course there is a difference between a quantum and a normal Lotto,
<br>
a quantum and a normal roulette. The difference is linked to the
<br>
quantum superposition principle (etc.).
<br>
<p>But there is a general 'philosophical' difference too.
<br>
<p>Let us suppose that Alice is spinning a normal roulette and Bob moves
<br>
his hand. From classical physics we get there is no relation between
<br>
the output, the number Alice gets, and Bob's hand. (Ok, we can also
<br>
think that classical physics is non-local ...., but we avoid this.)
<br>
<p>Now let us suppose that Alice is spinning a quantum roulette. Quantum
<br>
physics is not deterministic and (maybe) also non-local. So there
<br>
might be a relation between the output, the number Alice gets,
<br>
and Bob's hand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it the case that in those universes where this number set doesn't win,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of you will all see punctate recordings on the detector, while in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the n million fewer universes where it *does* win, you'll all see an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference fringe? Or does the presence of a closed shutter in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes obliterate interference in *all* worlds?
</em><br>
<p>In our (present) world, the winning numbers of our quantum Lotto are
<br>
3, 15, 27, 28, 31 and 45, the shutter is open, you get the interference
<br>
pattern. In another world the losing numbers are 3, 15, 27, 28, 31 and 45,
<br>
the shutter is closed, you do not see the interference pattern. Or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the 1 in n million test universes where fringes do show, you'll invest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a ticket and be rich the next day. Better than *none* of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning...
</em><br>
<p>It is also possible that in some universe there is a time reversal, due
<br>
to the time symmetrical Schroedinger equation. Hmmm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (As I recall, the mere possibility of closing the shutter forces the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-interference, but maybe that gets finessed in this approach?)
</em><br>
<p>Yes the orthodox QM interpretation says that the mere possibility of
<br>
reading a pointer, the mere possibility of realizing 'which path',
<br>
the mere presence of a device, the mere possibility of getting
<br>
some inormation force the non interference. But this is wrong.
<br>
The effect is physical, of course. It has been shown (in the two slit
<br>
electron interference) it is due to the asymmetrical spread of the
<br>
wavepacket, because of photon scattering.
<br>
<p>Wootters and Zurek [&quot;Complementarity in the Double-
<br>
Slit Experiment: Quantum Nonseparability and a
<br>
Quantitative Statement of Bohr's Principle&quot;, in
<br>
Physical Review, D19,(1979)]showed that photons
<br>
still have a 'wave-like' behaviour even if the path
<br>
is predicted *almost* certainly (99%). This gedanken
<br>
experiment is very interesting. Their apparatus
<br>
is a single-slit + a double-slit + a screen.
<br>
<p>Greenberger and Yasin wrote in mathematical terms the Complementarity
<br>
Principle as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p^2 + n^2 =1
<br>
where p is the predictability of the path (in the double-slit
<br>
experiment) and n is the visibility of the interference fringes.
<br>
<p>Thomas V. Marcella wrote a beautiful paper about
<br>
<a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/abstract/0143-0807/23/6/303/">http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/abstract/0143-0807/23/6/303/</a>
<br>
&quot;quantum interference with slits&quot;, a truly quantum mechanical
<br>
treatment, or it seems so. (Wheeler gave another treatment
<br>
in 1978).
<br>
<p>'Young's experiment and the finiteness of information'
<br>
Caslav Brukner, Anton Zeilinger
<br>
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A 360 (2002) 1061
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201026">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0201026</a>
<br>
Young's experiment is the quintessential quantum experiment. It is argued
<br>
here that quantum interference is a consequence of the finiteness of
<br>
information. The observer has the choice whether that information manifests
<br>
itself as path information or in the interference pattern or in both
<br>
partially to the extent defined by the finiteness of information.
