<p><em>&gt; A number of reasons.  None sufficient by itself to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;why does the USA still have troops in rich Europe&quot;, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together they could begin to shed some light...
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the extensive response.  I'll number your
<br>
reasons and amend them for brevity, and include Kai's
<br>
and Christian's as I go along (thanks to them also).
<br>
<p>1. Because maintaining bases that allow global military
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deployment is in the interest of American foreign policy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Christian)
<br>
<p>2. Europeans save money on defense that way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Fabio)
<br>
<p>3. A military ally that was as strong as the US (or anywhere
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near) would rise a whole set of problems neither side
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really wish to confront.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Fabio) --- see below for his extended comments
<br>
<p>4. The bases exist; it would be costly to rebuild them somewhere else
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kai)
<br>
<p>5. The political landscape here is rather stable and reliable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kai)
<br>
<p>6. To fulfill their duties according to the NATO treaties
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kai)
<br>
<p>7. To maintain their NSA and CIA posts, the Echelon network, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kai)
<br>
<p>8. To keep a foot in the door for everything that happens here
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Kai)
<br>
<p>which is as Fabio also says below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Europeans save money on defense that way (significantly smaller % of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GDP is spent on the military than in the US). That way we can go on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pouring cash into our expensive welfare state...
</em><br>
<p>Being from a penny-pinching political tradition myself,
<br>
I had always suspected that the U.S. bases were profitable
<br>
things to have around economically.  Surely it was true
<br>
right after the war.  Is it still true?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The troubled and oil rich Middle East and Central Asia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more easily reached by US troops from a German base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than from an American one.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sure there's more!
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps someone will think of something, though
<br>
the above list is pretty good!
<br>
<p>We can, however, take the question posed by the subject
<br>
of this thread and ask it the other way around: why do
<br>
the Europeans permit American bases there?  (Yes, there
<br>
is some overlap with the answers above, I guess.)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; PS: The Roman empire grew out of violent conquest, but had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also win-win aspects: subject to roman control, pay your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes and you'll have the stability and access to markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to prosper.  It worked for centuries.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think that it was a great improvement on what
<br>
had gone on before, in most places, and was better 
<br>
than what went on after it fell too.  Of course, quite
<br>
a number of other nations, like Carthage, would very
<br>
strongly disagree!
