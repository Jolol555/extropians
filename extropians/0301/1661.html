In a message dated 1/30/2003 12:20:19 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=Re:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">lee@piclab.com</a> writes: If you're trying to make a point, citing a popular 
<br>
poll only makes me think you don't have any real information to point to.
<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to disagree with you -- Dr. Broderick gave us some real 
<br>
information about what his mind seizes upon when he is in the search mode.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't convey his delight over the 8 European countries that 
<br>
published a statement supporting our country and the correctness of our 
<br>
course of conduct.  He didn't convey his puzzlement that Schroeder's support 
<br>
has fallen to an all time low since his opposing us.  He found no reason to 
<br>
support our President's State of the union address.  But let a poll be 
<br>
published saying that over 80% of Europeans think we are a threat to world 
<br>
peace and Dr. Broderick is on that factoid like a chicken on a kernel of 
<br>
corn.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets face it Lee.  To a certain segment of the world's population the 
<br>
idea that Uncle Sugar is going to look out for its own interests and protect 
<br>
itself is enough to be frightening?  How tacky our conduct?
<br>
