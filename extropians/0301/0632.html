BBC - Anthrax as a cancer treatment
<br>
===================================
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2643223.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2643223.stm</a>
<br>
<p>Scientists have used a version of the anthrax toxin to kill tumours in
<br>
mice. The toxin was so effective that after just one treatment, tumours
<br>
were reduced in size by up to 92%. It works by targeting a protein
<br>
called urokinase which is produced in high levels by cancerous cells.

<br>
<p>To understand the genetic processes regulating fat biology, UT
<br>
Southwestern researchers generated nematode worms (Caenorhabditis
<br>
elegans) lacking two genes crucial for fat in mammals. Worms deficient
<br>
in either gene displayed a lipid-depleted phenotype – pale, skinny,
<br>
larval-arrested and lacking fat stores, said Graff. &quot;Our hypothesis was
<br>
that the same or related genes would control fat storage in worms and
<br>
mammals,&quot; Graff said. &quot;We took a couple of the genes thought to be among
<br>
the most important ones that control fat formation in mammals and
<br>
eliminated their function in the worms. Notably, the worms did not
<br>
accumulate fat; therefore, the worms appear to be a good model for fat
<br>
biology, which opens the possibility that they can be exploited to
<br>
improve human health.&quot; Using this phenotype, a genetic screen then
<br>
identified many additional genes that are necessary for fat accumulation
<br>
in worms, Graff said.

Miami Herald - Study says modified anthrax might fight cancer

<br>
<p>Anthrax, the bioterrorism agent that killed five people in 2001 and has
<br>
frightened millions more, may be an effective cancer killer, according
<br>
to new research from the National Institutes of Health. Genetically
<br>
engineered anthrax protein - designed to activate only on contact with a
<br>
chemical on the surface of malignant tumors - dramatically reduced and
<br>
even eradicated cancers in tests on hundreds of mice, according to a
<br>
study published Monday in the Proceedings of National Academy of
<br>
Sciences. Thanks to the genetic engineering, the anthrax did not poison
<br>
the mice...

<br>
<p>...it may be possible to stop Alzheimer's, and reverse the memory loss,
<br>
if treatments begin before brain cells die. The new idea is that the
<br>
disease starts when small clumps of a protein, amyloid, start
<br>
interrupting signals between nerve cells in the brain. The synapses,

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;From time immemorial, every living thing has shared the same basic set

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 amino acids from which all proteins are made. That is, until

now: A group of scientists say they have, for the first time, created an

proteins completely on its own. The research should help probe some of

<p>NOW SCIENTISTS have discovered that bacteria talk to one another
<br>
constantly, often cooperating in the construction of intricate

communities, known as biofilms, that allow them to thrive in ways they

never could as single-celled individuals. Unfortunately, these bustling

against a countryman, a statistician named Bjorn Lomborg, who had the

temerity to write a book challenging the conventional Danish wisdom -

that the world's environment is going to hell. The result, which found

its way into the New York Times and Washington Post this week [ed: 1/8],

was predictable. Lomborg was smeared in a vindictive and amateurish

fashion by a group that did not even have the grace to lay out coherent

charges or conduct its own investigation.
