<br>
Did they destroy the Al-Qaida network? Not at all. 
<br>
<p>You seem very sure of yourself.  Are you positive we didn't bury him under 
<br>
one of those mountains he was hiding under?  If he is alive and his network 
<br>
is intact how come we never get to listen to his cell phone calls anymore.  
<br>
Is his network destroyed or are they merely so scared they don't make contact 
<br>
with each other any more?  Or are they reduced to sending messengers back and 
<br>
forth to deliver their communications by hand?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you are sure he is alive and well please send his address to 
<br>
Donald Rumsfeld.  I think Mr. Rumsfeld wants to send him some visitors.  BTW, 
<br>
have you noticed that everyone knows where Mr. Rumsfeld lives but no one 
<br>
knows the location of Osama or even if he is alive or dead?  Now who is 
<br>
winning?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd BTW, we know we have disrupted their strategy because they 
<br>
published it on line.  They were going to use the same strategy they used 
<br>
against the Soviets.  They would entice us into the countryside and use their 
<br>
superior knowledge of the terrain to conduct hit and run raids until we were 
<br>
picked apart.  They did go into the countryside.  We did follow them.  Then 
<br>
things seemed to go awry.  They seem to be doing a lot more running than 
<br>
hitting, raiding or picking us apart.
