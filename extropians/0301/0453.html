<em>&gt; Not unless you're wealthy enough to be a sporting clays enthusiast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for those unfamiliar: &quot;sporting clays&quot; has been described as &quot;golf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with shotguns&quot; and it's a pricy hobby for, e.g., well-to-do plastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surgeons).
</em><br>
<p>I'd have to dispute this, Mike. I know a broad swath of people from
<br>
various socio-economic stations who are clays shooters. One is the cook
<br>
in the cafeteria of the local community hospital. His shooting buddy is
<br>
in fact a heart surgeon (top doc there, in fact), but I know fellows
<br>
who are ski area managers, coaches, farmers, landscapers, engineers and
<br>
semi-student mechanics/computer nuts.
<br>
<p>Shotguns (side by sides, over and unders, or semiautos) can be had for
<br>
under $500 if you hunt for them, and a round of clays can run from
<br>
$40-60, so it is in fact a more affordable sport than skiing or
<br>
snowboarding (or computer gaming).... but I digress....
