<em>&gt; Samantha,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its motives.  Would it wreck your world view to suddenly realise that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans just like other people sometimes make a mistake and this has long 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since caused Americans to be stirred &quot;to a bit deeper reflection.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>IMHO, it is a small person or nation that considers pointing out 
<br>
an error to be an &quot;attack&quot;. Less generally, it behooves us to 
<br>
consider what led to Saddam in part and whether our proposed 
<br>
actions are free of such taint where possible so we don't create 
<br>
other things that will later on be seen as regretable and dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Harry S. Truman once made a comment that was not intended the way it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was taken and the result was the Korean War.  Was he not allowed to correct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his statement?   Were we allowed to help the South Koreans despite what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truman had said?
</em><br>
<p><p>Irrelevant to the case at hand.  I am simply calling for more 
<br>
honesty as a nation that is evident in official proclamations 
<br>
and posturings of late.  I don't see where that is in the least 
<br>
out of order.
