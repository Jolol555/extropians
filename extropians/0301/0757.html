John Clark (January 8) agrees with Technotranscendence (December 30)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=RE:%20U.S.%20Had%20Key%20Role%20in%20Iraq%20Buildup:%20Trade%20in%20Chemical%20Arms%20Allowed%20Despite%20Their%20Use%20on%20Iranians,%20Kurds">neptune@mars.superlink.net</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the &quot;administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous items that had both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military and civilian applications, including poisonous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as anthrax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and bubonic plague.&quot;  If this is true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It almost certainly is true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; then should not also the people behind these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; transfers be punished for putting America in danger?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In retrospect it turned out to be a very bad idea, but I don't know of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law that was violated.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Bad idea&quot;?  I'll say.  What were they thinking??  In
<br>
the first place, alliances have been shifting since
<br>
pre-history, so how could the experienced state
<br>
department and pentagon foreign policy experts of
<br>
the first Bush administration have failed to consider
<br>
that possibly Iraq would not be on &quot;their side&quot; one
<br>
day?
<br>
<p>Also, BIOLOGICAL weapons?  Didn't it occur to anyone
<br>
that these are a poor man's nukes?  And that all advanced
<br>
nations are put at risk by this act?
<br>
<p>Some key paragraphs from the URL supplied by Technotranscendence:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opinions differ among Middle East experts and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;former government officials about the pre-Iraqi
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tilt, and whether Washington could have done
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more to stop the flow to Baghdad of technology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for building weapons of mass destruction. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was a horrible mistake then, but we have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;got it right now,&quot; says Kenneth M. Pollack,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a former CIA military analyst and author of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Threatening Storm,&quot; which makes the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case for war with Iraq. &quot;My fellow [CIA]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analysts and I were warning at the time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Hussein was a very nasty character. We
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were constantly fighting the State Department.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fundamentally, the policy was justified,&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argues David Newton, a former U.S. ambassador
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Baghdad, who runs an anti-Hussein radio
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;station in Prague. &quot;We were concerned that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq should not lose the war with Iran,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because that would have threatened Saudi
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arabia and the Gulf. Our long-term hope
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was that Hussein's government would become
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less repressive and more responsible.&quot;
<br>
<p>Amazing.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes present-day Hussein different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the Hussein of the 1980s, say Middle
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East experts, is the mellowing of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iranian revolution and the August 1990
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invasion of Kuwait that transformed the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraqi dictator, almost overnight, from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awkward ally into mortal enemy. In addition,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the United States itself has changed.  As a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attacks on New York and Washington, U.S.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policymakers take a much more alarmist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view of the threat posed by the proliferation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of weapons of mass destruction.
<br>
<p>Well, the biological weapons granted to Iraq included anthrax!
<br>
<p>See the URL below that Dan gave originally for the full story,
<br>
but it would be nice if more had been said about the anthrax.
