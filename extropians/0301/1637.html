<p><em>&gt; Robert said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The price of oil is subject to a complex &quot;present value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; analysis&quot; of both the countries producing it and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consumers.  It comes down to a question of &quot;do I gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; more by pumping the oil or leaving it in the ground?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee responds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who ever gains more by leaving it the ground?  (Besides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; U.S. farmers, I mean.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many people I'm afraid. It's a question of time horizons. You compare the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return you would get by pumping the oil now to what you might get in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future assuming (a) you, your heirs or assigns will still control it  (b)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sources have been depleted in the meantime and (c) there's been no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological breakthrough in the meantime to cause a slump in demand. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't just apply to oil the same is true of other resources, above all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land. It can pay not to develop land but to leave it idle if this leads to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise in its capital value or to a rise in rents at a future date.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that makes perfect sense.  But (c) supposing that there's no
<br>
tech breakthrough, you're gambling that the oil in the ground will
<br>
become significantly more valuable over time.  Right now, I think
<br>
that the Saudis or any other big investor can get quite a return
<br>
on their profits, perhaps 5-8% or more, intelligently invested in
<br>
the right places.
<br>
<p>The only reason I personally understand, then, to leave it in the
<br>
ground is that you don't have very much of it.  An oil company
<br>
that projected that its reserves would run out in a decade or so
<br>
might well be better off to forego investing in new equipment, and 
<br>
continue to extract the oil with its present machinery.  But the
<br>
*big* oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela,
<br>
and Mexico won't be running out of oil until the whole world does,
<br>
and that's not in the foreseeable future.  (The need of money *now*
<br>
in these regimes would---it still seems to me---overpower long
<br>
term benefit anyway even if it existed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Leaving all the profits to Iraq?  That's not how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; markets work.  Unless they achieve a cartel, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forces down the world market price of oil, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this *is* what some producers have done in the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly the Saudis.  You forgo profits in the short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term (let them accrue to whoever controls Iraq) in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectation that the income your resource will generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the future will be greater than it would otherwise be.
</em><br>
<p>I thought that they did this only when their cartel was
<br>
working.  No?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An important consideration here is the time horizon of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Saudi rulers.  If they think they are going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overthrown in the near future they have every reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cash in their chips now but if they are confident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of holding on the incentives work the other way.
</em><br>
<p>When you say &quot;cash in their chips now&quot;, do you believe
<br>
that they are afraid of running out?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Don't you acknowledge that the Saudis and everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; else are trying to make as much money as they can?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes but when - within what time horizon?
</em><br>
<p>That's what makes this a difficult but interesting
<br>
discussion :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee concludes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why, no.  Of course they'll have to change their behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They'll either have to lower their price or sell less.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not at all. There's a third option (although you could say it's another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of the second). The factor that might well make the Saudis behave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way you predict lee, is the demographics they face. They have a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overqualified young men and not enough jobs for them (jobs they are keen on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is) so a decline in oil income has sever political implications for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, a short time horizon, especially for countries less
<br>
stable, could indeed (one would think!) cause an increase
<br>
in production.  That it's not happening in some places,
<br>
e.g., Venezuela, is quite bizarre, but shows, I guess, the
<br>
inevitable political component.
<br>
<p>But what you wrote here---the &quot;third option&quot;---I don't follow.
<br>
In my simple minded picture, I suppose that a Western-run Iraq
<br>
might within five years or so be producing significantly more
<br>
oil.  So the world-wide price must fall.  Therefore, the Saudis
<br>
or anyone else must either obtain drastically less revenue or
<br>
raise production themselves.  Doesn't this seem right?
