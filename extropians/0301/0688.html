Mike Lorrey, ever on the prowl for a few good men, writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is patently false that humans are born free or with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right to his or her own person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, then, Sheeeeaaat!  Lee, why don't you mosey on over here so's I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kin clap you in some chains. I 'bin in need of a good slave for a while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now, seein' as how buying power has eroded so much of late.  I shorely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could use an extra set of hands workin' on my behalf.
</em><br>
<p>No doubt you could.  Doesn't sound like too much fun,
<br>
though, and besides, I'm booked through April.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Our Natural Rights evolve specifically out of our evolution, via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; natural selection, as individualistic social primates with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; inclination toward tool invention and use and exploration of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; habitat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It really surprises me that a number of distinguished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinkers can believe in such a thing given the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discoveries in so many branches of science, but especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anthropology.  You're quite clear and correct about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;individualistic social primates with an inclination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; toward tool invention&quot;, but what has this to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natural Rights are those legal liberties which the evolutionary history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human culture has demonstrated provide superior selection, survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of both the individual and the society in which the individual resides.
</em><br>
<p>There has no doubt been a trend towards such during the last three
<br>
hundred years or so; and adumbrations stretch back to the successful
<br>
policies of Greece and Rome.  But these are extreme exceptions in
<br>
the vast panoply of history.  In most eras and for most tribes and
<br>
nations, it couldn't work; some critical elements of culture were
<br>
lacking.  Even if you'd gone up to the Great King as he was finding
<br>
the Athenians and some of the others a bit troublesome, and had
<br>
completely talked him and all his immediate subordinates and
<br>
satraps into all these ideas, it would not have flown.
<br>
<p>This is, in fact, the error so common among those who believe that
<br>
all Africa needed in 1960 was freedom and democracy.  Sorry, (we
<br>
should have told them had we only known then), takes centuries of
<br>
preparation and development.  Try to learn from your Western
<br>
superiors the arts of self-government, and plan on at least a
<br>
century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...all the way back to Aristotle a scientific recognition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that societies which recognized this right had greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survivability (as did the individuals who exercised these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights).
</em><br>
<p>Even if he said this, he would be accurate only about his
<br>
society, that is, cultures on a par with Greece or Rome.
<br>
By the way, do you have a reference for this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, technology in general is the natural right of those primates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create, own, and use, free of interference.  These include cloning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stem cells, cryonics, AI, space technology, nanotech, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like you all mean &quot;default&quot; or &quot;manifest&quot; or something
<br>
when you write &quot;natural&quot;.  I agree that these are good things.
<br>
I agree that explanations exist for why advanced civilizations
<br>
are better off with those things than without those things
<br>
readily exist.
<br>
<p>I have to translate the above as &quot;Mike Lorrey approves of
<br>
primates like us being free of interference to own and to
<br>
create, and believes that great benefits will accrue to
<br>
our nations when we adopt and promote these things.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In my book, what the Enlightenment philosophers achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is they described the ideas (notions) that were being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; developed in their times, consciously or unconsciously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and expressed two important other things:  One, that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; highly approved of these new views, and that two, such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumptions embodied into habit and legal precedent *worked*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; i.e., made societies more prosperous and resourceful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But WHY did they make societies more prosperous and resourceful if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not a matter of them being in greater agreement with the Objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Truth embedded into the warp and weave of the universe? 
</em><br>
<p>Luckily, we know why, or at least think we do.  Sometimes, we
<br>
only know that things seem to be a certain way.  For sure, 
<br>
however, saying that the answer is &quot;because it's a natural
<br>
law&quot; gets one nowhere---might as well talk of essences.
<br>
<p>And yes, I will readily admit that one way to sum up
<br>
the success of capitalism, say, and the failures of
<br>
socialism are that the self-interest taken advantage
<br>
of by the former is a part of human nature.  The
<br>
attempted suppression of what some would call &quot;greed&quot;
<br>
by communist regimes didn't succeed.  But all this can
<br>
easily be addressed by very down-to-earth vocabulary
<br>
and concepts as is done in scores of books.
<br>
<p>Here are six I just grabbed off the shelf:
<br>
<p>Knowledge and Decisions, by Thomas Sowell
<br>
The Origins of Virtue, by Matt Ridley
<br>
The Fatal Conceit, by F.A. Hayek
<br>
Power and Prosperity, by Mancur Olsen
<br>
The Mystery of Capital, by Hernando De Soto
<br>
Carnage and Culture, by Victor Davis Hanson
<br>
<p>Not a one has &quot;natural rights&quot; or &quot;natural law&quot;
<br>
in the index.  And if any did, you'd think either
<br>
Sowell, in his huge book, or Victor Davis Hanson
<br>
(who explains so extremely well the advantages
<br>
the Greeks and the West in general has in armed
<br>
conflicts against those who have no feeling for
<br>
individualism and legal rights of citizens)
<br>
would have.
<br>
<p>So what is going on?  Must one look back into
<br>
dusty books written by 19th century historians,
<br>
or highly theoretical works by way-out libertarians?
<br>
None of the most modern and pressing expositions
<br>
appear to give any credence to this concept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Enlightenment philosophers saw themselves first as scientists, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they saw no delineation between scientists and philosophy, and both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existed to serve and demonstrate the validity of the deist God and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisdom in constructing such a universe. Our place in that universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discover the Objective Truth of Natural Law through the use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science and technology, and in the end to use that knowledge to reach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Omega Point.
</em><br>
<p>Fine, if you're switching over to mean the real laws of nature,
<br>
not these highly dubious IMO &quot;natural rights&quot;.
<br>
<p>Well, hmm, maybe not so fine.  I've always felt our place in
<br>
the universe was primarily to have a good time!  Boffo!
