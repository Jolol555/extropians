<em>&gt;&gt; That would be great if it worked but Kahdafi is still alive.
</em><br>
<p>Once he was forced to pay the personal price of losing a loved one 
<br>
(his child).  His behavior completely changed at least as 
<br>
far as his sponsoring of terrorism went.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; One of Saddam's many doubles might be there but the real thing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would be nuts to go anywhere near one of his palaces or a bomb 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; shelter. During the 91 gulf war he spent a lot of time riding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; around Baghdad in ordinary looking taxies, at night he'd pick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a house at random, kick the owners out and sleep there.
</em><br>
<p>That's one reason why the attack should be a surprise just as the one 
<br>
On Libya was.  Also even if he was not killed personally he would pay 
<br>
a price.  His palaces, family, pets, personal possessions and the symbol
<br>
<p>of his power would all be gone.  How long do you think Sadam would want 
<br>
to live in one of his normal citizen's houses?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; If a weapon of mass destruction is used by him, we document it for
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the world, and wait some more
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Wait until he uses another one?
</em><br>
<p>Sadly yes, remember his weapons are not that accurate plus we have
<br>
antimissile 
<br>
Technology to defend as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad I'm not a soldier and you my commander in chief.
</em><br>
<p>That may be true.  But I wouldn't ask our boys enter Bagdad and fight
<br>
house
<br>
to house nor would I bomb the city and it's people back into the stone
<br>
age
<br>
creating an entirely new generation of terrorists.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;When this happens the world will see that we were right and the
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;level of restraint we have used to this  point.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It seems like a very high price to pay for good PR.
</em><br>
<p>This is not just good PR?  What we are trying to prevent is the creation
<br>
of a 
<br>
whole new generation of terrorists fueled by anti-american propaganda.
<br>
Unless
<br>
leaders are forced to pay a personal price, their behavior will not
<br>
change.  All 
<br>
The bombing we did in the last war, we didn't impact Sadam's life-style 
<br>
whatsoever!  His people suffered while he went back to his wives, his
<br>
children and
<br>
his luxorurious life-style!  Had his palace and family been destroyed
<br>
and he was forced
<br>
to start over he might have been too busy to be concerned about
<br>
rearming!
