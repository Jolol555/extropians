I have heard hundreds of opinions on vietnam but almost none on korea. I am 
<br>
hoping to find intellectual opinions on the korean conflict. I have recently 
<br>
talked with a friend who claims to be an historian but he didn't really 
<br>
offer much information. Basically, what was really going on? Also what 
<br>
relation did korea have if any to Vietnam? What relation did korea have to 
<br>
WW2?
<br>
<p>Any info or new ideas would be helpful, thanks Nate
<br>
<p>***Well, first let me welcome you aboard, not that I'm an old hand myself, 
<br>
but the more the merrier. I am a student of history, and hopefully my history 
<br>
minor counts for something. It is unfortunate that the Korean War has been 
<br>
such a neglected conflict, in terms of contemporary discussion, not least of 
<br>
all because of all the Americans who lost their lives there in a noble cause.
<br>
<p>But the Korean War also helps to provide a better understanding of the 
<br>
Vietnam War, especially when closely examined. Most people deride the Vietnam 
<br>
War as a pointless folly, while very few dismiss the Korean War as such. This 
<br>
is quite interesting, when one considers they were in essence the same 
<br>
conflict.
<br>
<p>In each case you had a Communist Northern totalitarian entity backed with men 
<br>
and materiel from the Soviet Union and China pitted against a Southern 
<br>
authoritarian regime backed by the United States and its allies.
<br>
<p>There are many reasons why one effort succeeded and one failed. In both 
<br>
cases, the Communist North began by attempting to sow the seeds of revolution 
<br>
in the South through the use of guerrilla warfare and political 
<br>
assassination. In South Korea, this effort failed miserably, just as it had 
<br>
earlier in Malaya and Burma. In South Vietnam this tactic also eventually 
<br>
failed, but not before destroying morale and public support for the war in 
<br>
the United States. The North Vietnamese were able to keep the guerrillas 
<br>
afloat through the use of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the supply line that led 
<br>
through Laos and Cambodia and into South Vietnam. In the cases of South Korea 
<br>
and Malaya, they are surrounded by water, and the Communists had no way to 
<br>
continually re-supply the rebels, and they died out within a year or two. 
<br>
<p>It is also important to note that the North Vietnamese Army's Ho Chi Minh 
<br>
Trail was in blatant violation of Article 12 of the Geneva Accords, which 
<br>
stated that all parties would respect the neutrality of Laos and Cambodia.
<br>
<p>In the end, both conflicts in Korea and Vietnam were to become conventional 
<br>
wars. In one instance, the South Koreans were able to achieve a stalemate due 
<br>
in large part to a huge commitment of American men and supplies in the face 
<br>
of conventional attack. The South Vietnamese, by contrast, were defeated by 
<br>
the third largest army in the world at that time (see Stephen J. Morris, &quot;Why 
<br>
Vietnam invaded Cambodia&quot;) armed to the teeth with state of the art Soviet 
<br>
weaponry and Chinese logistic aid. All this at a time when United States aid 
<br>
had all but dried up.
<br>
<p>Perhaps you have seen the picture of the North Vietnamese crashing down the 
<br>
gates of the Saigon Presidential residence in 1975. They are aboard Soviet 
<br>
T-54 tanks.
<br>
<p>In fact, what is most disturbing of all in my mind is the fact that most 
<br>
people are aware, to some degree, that on June 25, 1950, the North Koreans 
<br>
launched an invasion force of 135,000 men into South Korea. Most people are 
<br>
ignorant, however, that the North Vietnamese launched an invasion into the 
<br>
South on March 30, 1972, of 250,000 men! So blatant was this attack, in fact, 
<br>
that not one regular division remained in North Vietnam. (see Lewis Sorley, 
<br>
&quot;A Better War&quot;, and Michael Lind's &quot;Vietnam, the Necessary War&quot;)
<br>
<p>By July 1st, 1950, the North Koreans had captured the South Korean capital of 
<br>
Seoul. During the five month North Vietnamese invasion, only the northern 
<br>
city of Quang Tri fell to the Communists, and that was retaken by the South 
<br>
Vietnamese despite the fact that they were outnumbered and only 6000 US 
<br>
combat troops remained in the country.  In fact, Seoul would fall not once, 
<br>
but twice, during the Korean War to the Communists. 
<br>
<p>Despite that, we did not leave Korea. We did not, as Walter Cronkite said 
<br>
following the TET Offensive of 1968 in which the Viet Cong captured ONE FLOOR 
<br>
of our embassy in Saigon, decide to withdraw because our enemy could &quot;match 
<br>
any move we made, any escalation.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Americans, in fact, after a daring landing at Inchon in northern South 
<br>
Korea, behind the advancing North Korean army, actually turned the tide of 
<br>
the war quickly. By October 1st, 1950, Seoul had been retaken by US and South 
<br>
Korean forces. It was at this point that General Douglas MacArthur, commander 
<br>
of the allied forces, was able to convince Truman and his cabinet that he 
<br>
could conquer North Korea and reunify the country once and for all. It would 
<br>
prove to be a costly mistake, one that would haunt the United States and 
<br>
contribute directly to their defeat by the Soviet proxy in Vietnam. 
<br>
<p>Within two weeks, allied forces had crossed the 38th parallel (the border 
<br>
between the two Koreas) and on October 27th, Pyongyang, the capital of North 
<br>
Korea, fell. MacArthur continued his march toward the Yalu River, the border 
<br>
between Korea and China. On November 26, 1950, the Chinese launched a 
<br>
surprise attack, sending a &quot;human wave&quot; of 300,000 men at the stunned allies. 
<br>
Forced into a humiliating retreat, MacArthur was informed on November 30 that 
<br>
reunification was no longer a goal of the United States. 
<br>
<p>Avoiding total defeat became the primary goal, as once again, on January 7, 
<br>
1951, the Communists captured Seoul. Having rejected the United States offer 
<br>
of a cease-fire that would've provided him with a major public relations 
<br>
victory, Mao hoped to deal the allies a crippling defeat. It too would be a 
<br>
major mistake. The air support promised by Stalin never came, and US bombing 
<br>
and offensive efforts turned the tide again by April. When MacArthur again 
<br>
pressed to take the attack to the Chinese in North Korea, he was relieved of 
<br>
command by Truman and replaced by General Matthew Ridgeway.
<br>
<p>This stalemate would last until 1953, when President Eisenhower was able to 
<br>
use threats of the United States overwhelming nuclear superiority and a dying 
<br>
Joseph Stalin to achieve an armistice. The cease-fire remains in affect to 
<br>
this day, as does the presence of thousands of US troops in South Korea. A 
<br>
fifty- year commitment has been required of the United States to maintain two 
<br>
Koreas, and the differences in the quality of life in the two nations could 
<br>
not be any more stark.
<br>
<p>The Chinese involvement in Korea, and the threat of it in Vietnam, in a sense 
<br>
doomed our efforts to succeed in Saigon before the first combat troops 
<br>
arrived. Lyndon Johnson chose not to send US troops into North Vietnam for 
<br>
fear of Chinese reprisals. He chose to follow the policies of his 
<br>
predecessor, John Kennedy, and &quot;neutralized&quot; Cambodia and Laos, not sending 
<br>
any combat troops in to disrupt the Ho Chi Minh Trail. 
<br>
<p>The United States had tied its hands behind its back, fighting a three front 
<br>
war in only the nation of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese could choose 
<br>
when and where to engage the United States, and all the Americans could do 
<br>
was suffer casualties. Lewis Sorley pointed out that the NVA initiated 88% of 
<br>
the battles in the Vietnam War. 
<br>
<p>Still, all was not lost. In January of 1968, the North Vietnamese chose to 
<br>
launch the Tet Offensive, a coordinated assault on all of South Vietnam's 
<br>
major cities, in hopes of sparking a peasant revolution that would overthrow 
<br>
the South Vietnamese regime. This plan failed, as no popular uprising took 
<br>
place, the Viet Cong infrastructure was rooted out and severely damaged, and 
<br>
the North Vietnamese Army suffered 45,000 casualties. 
<br>
<p>But what was in fact a crippling blow to the North Vietnamese was turned into 
<br>
a psychological victory for them by an all to cooperative US press. I will 
<br>
not dwell on this issue here, I will simply leave it to the words of Colonel 
<br>
Bui Tin, the NVA colonel who accepted the South Vietnamese defeat in 1975:
<br>
<p>&quot;Thanks to the media, which exaggerated the damage caused by this offensive, 
<br>
the American public was bedazzled, and the administration had to agree to 
<br>
negotiations in Paris.&quot; (Bui Tin, &quot;Following Ho Chi Minh&quot;, p. 62)
<br>
<p>After the TET Offensive, the war actually began to go in the US's favor, as 
<br>
the South Vietnamese populace at large was finally introduced to the brutal 
<br>
terror of the Hanoi regime. The number of enlistees in the ARVN increased, 
<br>
and the South Vietnamese was able to consolidate more control over its own 
<br>
territory. 
<br>
<p>I could go into the remainder of the Vietnam War at length, but that would 
<br>
probably be another two plus pages, and I know your focus was mainly on 
<br>
Korea. I hope you have found some of this information helpful. If I can add, 
<br>
or clarify anything else, I'd be happy to. Feel free to comment/ critique on 
<br>
what I've provided, and again, welcome to the forum.
<br>
