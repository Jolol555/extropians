<p>It's good to see someone look at this from an historical perspective, which

tells us (well me, anyway) after all that war is generally crap for
<br>
everyone, excepting perhaps the leadership on the winning side, (assuming
<br>
the result is callable).

</em><br>
<p>I don't think that you are seriously suggesting this as the reasoning behind
<br>
the current behaviour of the US administration. It seems spectacularly
<br>
unlikely that the US govt would be marching into what is coincidentally an
<br>
unfriendly oil producer because of future concerns about nanotech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if that were the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Either the US is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think it's that second thing, probably combined with a good bit of the
<br>
third. The first option, well, that seems unlikely.

<p><em>&gt; I wish

<p>You'd probably do better with the same time invested in the relationships
<br>
between big corporations and the US government; there is no indication that
<br>
anything approximating diplomacy is involved. 
<br>
<p>OTOH, that'd be a big waste of time. It seems to be that even a fairly
<br>
mediocre set of bullshit detectors will inform you that the current rhetoric
<br>
about war, and the proposed actions, match like stripes and plaid. The
<br>
really stunning thing to my mind, is that Bush Inc. is spouting such a
<br>
spectacularly flimsy line to support its actions. Probably scary is a better
<br>
word than stunning. Scary, because they don't seem to give a shit what
<br>
anyone else thinks about the things they propose to do, given that no-one
<br>
can do anything about it. 
<br>
<p>Just think about the phrase &quot;War on Terror&quot; for a moment. It's catchy, but
<br>
meaningless. Terror is an emotion, or maybe a procedure used in warfare at
<br>
best. How do you declare war on that? How do you even declare war on
<br>
terrorists, in general? Isn't it a bit pervasive and vague?
<br>
<p>The answer to this seems to be (and has from the ominous beginning) that you
<br>
execute a war on terror by choosing who best represents terror, and beating
<br>
the living crap out of them. As it's a vague notion, you need only give
<br>
vague justification. As it's pervasive, you can do pervasive things to fight
<br>
it (like setting up ubiquitous networks of informants amongst your people,
<br>
like imprisoning people on suspicion of things, like changing the rules on
<br>
freedom of speech).
<br>
<p>It's just scary. As to the idea that the US govt might need to do the same
<br>
thing in the future to control rogue states with nanotech, well, how
<br>
comfortable will anyone here feel when Bush Inc. controls nanotech,
<br>
planetwide? If we got to plan the development of nanotech, would we include
<br>
&quot;total control and policing by the US govt&quot; as one of our dot-points?
