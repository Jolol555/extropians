&quot;Here's food for thought to those on the left that would like to claim that
<br>
people like Osama bin Laden and Mohammad Atta&quot;
<br>
<p>Both of these claims appear to be false, at least according to the Urban
<br>
Legends Reference page.
<br>
<p>Claim: Oliver North stated during the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings that Osama
<br>
bin Laden was &quot;the most evil person alive&quot; and that &quot;an assassin team
<br>
[should] be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.&quot;
<br>
Status:   False. From - <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/north.htm">http://www.snopes.com/rumors/north.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Salient points
<br>
<p>- Senator Al Gore of Tennessee was not a member of the United States Senate
<br>
Select Committee on Secret Military Assistance to Iran and the Nicaraguan
<br>
Opposition and therefore did not take part in the questioning of any
<br>
witnesses before the Committee.
<br>
<p>- Oliver North did not testify about or speak the name Osama bin Laden
<br>
during the Iran-Contra hearings. He claimed that threats against his life
<br>
had been made by terrorist Abu Nidal, telling a congressional committee: 
<br>
<p>&quot;I want you to know that I'd be more than willing . . . to meet Abu Nidal on
<br>
equal terms anywhere in the world. There's an even deal for him. OK? But I
<br>
am not willing to have my wife and my four children meet Abu Nidal or his
<br>
organization on his terms.  &quot;
<br>
<p>- To the extent that bin Laden was known to the western world in 1987, it
<br>
was not as a &quot;terrorist&quot; but as one of the U.S.-backed &quot;freedom fighters&quot;
<br>
participating in the war against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Osama
<br>
bin Laden's hatred of the U.S. and conversion to &quot;terrorist&quot; status is not
<br>
believed to have come about until the Gulf War of 1990-91 
<br>
<p>AND
<br>
<p>Claim: A convicted terrorist released by Israel at the insistence of the
<br>
United States participated in the September 11 terrorist attacks on America.
<br>
Status:   False. From - <a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/atta.htm">http://www.snopes.com/rumors/atta.htm</a>  Both were
<br>
named Mohammad Atta, but were in fact different individuals with the same
<br>
name.  
<br>

<br>

Subject: Food For Thought
<br>
<p><p>Here's food for thought to those on the left that would like to claim
<br>
that people like Osama bin Laden and Mohammad Atta were in the employ
<br>
of the CIA and/or were on our most favored muslim whackjobs list in the
<br>
1980's (though it seems they were on the Democrats preference list)..
<br>
<p>&quot;Anyone remember this?? It was 1987!  At a lecture the other day they 
<br>
Were playing an old news video of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at
<br>
the Iran-Contra hearings during the Reagan Administration. There was
<br>
Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree, but what he
<br>
said was  stunning! 
<br>
He was being drilled by a senator; &quot;Did you not recently spend close To
<br>
$60,000 for a home security system?&quot; 
<br>
Ollie replied, &quot;Yes, I did, Sir.&quot; 
<br>
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience,
<br>
&quot;Isn't that just a little excessive?&quot; 
<br>
&quot;No, sir,&quot; continued Ollie. 
<br>
&quot;No? And why not?&quot; the senator asked.
<br>
&quot;Because the lives of my family and I were threatened, sir.&quot; 
<br>
&quot;Threatened? By whom?&quot; the senator questioned. 
<br>
&quot;By a terrorist, sir&quot; Ollie answered.
<br>
&quot;Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?&quot; 
<br>
&quot;His name is Osama bin Laden, sir&quot; Ollie replied. 
<br>
At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
<br>
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't.  A couple
<br>
of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued. &quot;Why are
<br>
you so afraid of this man?&quot; the senator asked. 
<br>
&quot;Because, sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of&quot; Ollie
<br>
answered. 
<br>
&quot;And what do you recommend we do about him?&quot; asked the senator. 
<br>
&quot;Well, sir, if it was up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team
<br>
be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.&quot; 
<br>
The senator disagreed with this approach, and that was all that was
<br>
shown of the clip. By the way, that senator was Al Gore.
<br>
<p>ALSO: Terrorist pilot Mohammad Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. 
<br>
The Israelis captured, tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo 
<br>
agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release
<br>
so-called &quot;political prisoners&quot;. However, the Israelis would not
<br>
release any with blood on their hands.  The American President at the
<br>
time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher,
<br>
&quot;insisted&quot; that all prisoners be released.
<br>
Thus Mohammad Atta was freed and eventually thanked the US by flying an
<br>
airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by
<br>
many of the American TV networks at the time that the terrorists were
<br>
first identified.
<br>
It was censored in the US from all later reports.&quot;
