<br>
<p><p>Perhaps the war is an liability for the major meme-clusters.
<br>
<p>1) Liberals: bending over for the Republicans on just about every important
<br>
issue in front of the whole world. If they're going to agree with Bush on
<br>
everything, not much point in their existing as a separate ideology, is there?
<br>
<p>2) Leftists: as usual conflating inept government and dogmatic foreign policy
<br>
with American individualist values, the free market, and American culture
<br>
being inherently evil. What's their proposed solution? Why, more government
<br>
control over the economic and social spheres of course.
<br>
<p>3) Conservatives: sitting pretty now, but probably not a good idea to be on
<br>
record supporting them a few years from now once they start getting blamed in
<br>
earnest for the continuing state of the economy, corporate favoritism, and of
<br>
course dead people (both &quot;ours&quot; and &quot;foreign&quot;).
<br>
<p>The only ones coming out of this smelling like roses are the theocrats, whose
<br>
respective constituencies seem to be more fanatically loyal to them than
<br>
ever. There is probably a lesson about spin to be learned here, but it may not
<br>
be a lesson that a rational meme-cluster will find useful.
<br>
<p>So, how can the best be made of a bad situation for the purpose of promoting
<br>
transhumanist values? Pointing out that the whole issue would be rendered
<br>
moot if individuals were given more freedom and power and governments
<br>
given less? Pointing out that technology, science, and reason can offer
<br>
better answers than the ones we have in our repertoire right now? How can
<br>
transhumanism (or some sort of toned-down, soft-sell public face thereof) be
<br>
presented as an alternative to the three bankrupt memes I mentioned, and done
<br>
so in a sufficiently public manner?
