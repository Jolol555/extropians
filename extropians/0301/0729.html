<p><em>&gt; In some of our recent discussion on human cloning, it was suggested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the technology should not be implemented until safety concerns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are addressed.  Now it appears that IVF, which has been in common use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for 20 years, also has safety issues.
</em><br>
<p>Actually the success rates for IVF have always lower than that for
<br>
natural birth, I haven't got the figures on hand, but heard it from an
<br>
IVF expert testifying to the Senate Committee in relation to the Research
<br>
Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill (in Australia).
<br>
<p>The comparitive figures have been converging however with improvements
<br>
in IVF techniques.
<br>
<p>It actually stands to reason that in the aggregate folks that are having
<br>
fertility
<br>
problems are going to have more sperm and/or egg &quot;quality&quot; problems or
<br>
perhaps related problems with embryo implantation. After all these are
<br>
the very sorts of problems that can cause them to seek IVF treatment.
<br>
<p>A fact often not considered by the general public in relation to IVF, (the
<br>
general public usually associates IVF with babies being made), is that quite
<br>
a bit of experimenting needs to be done to develop new cultural mediums
<br>
that may offer greater chances of success; to trail junior clinicians in
<br>
their
<br>
&quot;trade&quot;; to determine if say a woman's embryos have a particular easily
<br>
remediable condition that amounts to having too hard a  membrane for
<br>
cell division to take place post fertilization. A woman could have this
<br>
problem and be infertile all her life if she did not go to an IVF clinic and
<br>
have a simple test done on one of her embryos. If the test shows the
<br>
embryos have a particular condition there is a readily available treatment
<br>
that neatly steps around it and the woman can be made fertile quite easily.
<br>
<p>In practise most of the &quot;destructive&quot; testing that is done on embryos is
<br>
done on embryos that are *obviously* developing abnormally and could
<br>
never go on to produce a live child anyway.
<br>
<p>Still, once these, little considered (by the public and politicians) facts
<br>
became more widely known in the context of the above legislation,
<br>
some folk who had previously been in favour of IVF having seen it as
<br>
an essentially life bringing process, actually started to be think they
<br>
should change their mind. This was because they started to hear that
<br>
&quot;human beings&quot; (ie. unviable embryos - but the public and many of the
<br>
pollies did not had science to see such distinctions or the patience or
<br>
interest to learn them) were actually being routinely &quot;destroyed&quot; as part
<br>
of standard IVF practice. This &quot;destruction&quot; of &quot;human life&quot; was oriented
<br>
towards improve IVF methods, diagnosis, training and testing new
<br>
processes but it came at a &quot;cost&quot;.
<br>
<p>The IVF lobby, led by the patient advocacy group ACCESS and the
<br>
IVF Clinical Directors groups became so concerned about the backlash
<br>
from the community and alledged radical catholic elements within the
<br>
Australian Health Ethics Committee that they actually started to petition
<br>
against the bill that would have facilitated ES research.
<br>
<p>The religious conservatives and believers had frightened them so badly.
<br>
Fortunately, the IVF lobbys concerns were able to be addressed and
<br>
they found a more sensible strategic game plan. They stopped running
<br>
interference and fell back into line with the ES lobby. But for a while,
<br>
fear from the IVF lobby, that a strong community and political push,
<br>
based on increased but incomplete awareness of what had always
<br>
been happening in IVF clinics to little &quot;human being&quot; (ie.abnormal
<br>
embryos) nearly derailed the passing of the legislation. &quot;Panic&quot; nearly
<br>
split the IVF lobby from the ES cell and patient advocacy lobbies and
<br>
nearly handed the &quot;luddites&quot; a victory.
<br>
<p>Other technical considerations with types of IVF procedure were also
<br>
raised.
<br>
<p>For instance there seems to be evidence that a transfer of mitochondrial
<br>
DNA from younger women to older womens oocytes (eggs) can increase
<br>
the vitality of those eggs and the likelihood that the older woman will be
<br>
able to produce a child with her own nuclear DNA.  But the spectre of
<br>
mixing DNA even mitochondrial DNA from two women into one child
<br>
caused considerable concern. Some concern came from a not completely
<br>
unreasonable fear that their might be an immune reaction to the donor
<br>
mitochondrial DNA from the host at some point. A bigger concern
<br>
seemed to be that many just felt uncomfortable about producing children
<br>
that would have DNA including mitochondrial DNA from three parents
<br>
(mum, dad and the other younger woman). The procedure of &quot;cytoplasmic
<br>
transfer&quot; was thus banned in Australian or at least placed under moratorium
<br>
for three years (which means we wait for other countries in the world to
<br>
test
<br>
it first and then maybe later we do it here too). From memory the technique
<br>
has been used in the US for a couple of years.
<br>
<p>So technology is constantly changing, being revised and tweaked in IVF
<br>
clinics. As new things are learnt new possibilities for overcoming new
<br>
causes of infertility become possible. But they are only able to be proven
<br>
effective by first trying them. And they cannot always be tried only on
<br>
unviable embryos. Such is the price of IVF. Sometimes, some embryos
<br>
are expended to learn how to resolve infertility problems. Usually as much
<br>
testing as possible is done using only unviable embryos - but obviously
<br>
sooner or later some viable embryo has to be the first or the process
<br>
never gets tried for real. And so the risk is inherently higher for the that
<br>
first embryo (little &quot;human being&quot; or &quot;human life&quot; as some &quot;think&quot; it and
<br>
term it).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How do we balance the risk to our children against our desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduce?  When is it OK to use a new technology to have a child that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not otherwise be possible, if that technology also carries an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased risk of birth defects?
