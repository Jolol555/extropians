<p><em>&gt;&gt; Maybe the reason it has not been discussed before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (besides extraneous complications like public distaste 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for eugenics and cloning done by tiny self-appointed elites) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is that it is based on a faulty chain of correlations: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; high IQ =&gt; genes for high IQ =&gt; a clone will be potentially high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; IQ =&gt; good upbringing makes this potentiality real =&gt; several 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; really smart people help accelerate the singularity. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Imagine that each implication has a correlation of 0.8 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (which is likely far higher for several of these than it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is in reality). Then the total correlation would be just 0.4 - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; far less, although still non-zero. This is the same effect that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; makes the contribution of genetic IQ to the inheritance of social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; class so minor compared to other inheritance factors (like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; growing up in the right social networks etc). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Public distaste for eugenics should not come into play here because we
<br>
are not promoting selectively breeding warriors or a master race but
<br>
rather
<br>
creating a brain trust to ensure the survival of the human race.
<br>
Although the
<br>
public currently has a distaste for cloning this will disappear over
<br>
time
<br>
as cloning gets more common place and they start to see healthy children
<br>
<p>instead of clones.
<br>
<p>Documented High correlation of IQ in MZA Twins (much higher than 0.8
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/Issues/psychology/IQ/bouchard-twins">http://www.mugu.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/Issues/psychology/IQ/bouchard-twins</a>

<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; The most unlikely assumptions are the later ones. Especially the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; assumption that having around a small number of people that have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; got a great upbringing (note that this can be awfully hard too - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what is the right upbringing for a child in the first place? If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; one of them wants to become a fireman, priest or luddite, should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it be promoted or not?) and are likely to be smart will accelerate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; progress. We already have *millions* of smart people with fairly good
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; upbringings, plenty of those the children of top IQ researchers and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; scholars. 20 clones will be a drop in the ocean. While breakthroughs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are made by individual minds, they are so rare that they would not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; correlate very strongly with any particular group (after all, how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; many more Nobel laureates per capita are in Mensa than outside?). 
</em><br>
<p>Because we are suggesting that we provide what would could be called the
<br>
ideal 
<br>
mental and social environment.  I defined that as the children will get
<br>
to 
<br>
interact and compete with others of their intelligence they will not
<br>
face 
<br>
the boredom or negative social stigma associated with appearing to too 
<br>
smart that they would face in normal schools.  The teachers likewise be 
<br>
chosen for their ability to motivate and teach gifted students.  Common 
<br>
sense tells me children raised in such an environment would make much
<br>
better 
<br>
use of their learning and intellectual capacity than the same child in a
<br>
<p>normal school environment.
<br>
<p>The only remaining probability would be whether these children would
<br>
choose 
<br>
to make a positive contribution to the singularity.  Although this
<br>
should 
<br>
not be coercive they should be exposed to ideas and concept of the
<br>
singularity 
<br>
early in life.  Asked to write a few papers of it as they are growing
<br>
up.  
<br>
And provided with news and discussion about how it perhaps may affect
<br>
the 
<br>
singularity.  In this way we would hope to have their efforts
<br>
directed to the betterment of mankind if not the singularity itself.
<br>
<p>Once out of school these children should compete for research grants in
<br>
their chosen fields.
<br>
We will also learn much from a social experiment of this magnitude.
<br>
Instead of 20 I would say
<br>
20 per year!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you want to accelerate the singularity, isn't it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more cost-efficient to find ways of bringing extra 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stimulation to the already existing kids that have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; good potential but too little stimulation? Maybe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sesame Street 2.0 is more powerful than the cloning vat.
</em><br>
<p>This is too much of a shotgun approach.  Of course we need better
<br>
schools,
<br>
better teachers, and better family environments but we are working
<br>
towards 
<br>
that today.  Too many schools lack truly accelerated programs for the
<br>
gifted
<br>
to help them reach their full potential.  That is because with only one
<br>
genius 
<br>
they are liable to become bored and labeled a troublemaker instead of
<br>
being 
<br>
challenged and fostered.  Even making computers available to every child
<br>
that needs
<br>
them is a challenge right now.  When we put them in classrooms too often
<br>
they sit
<br>
unused because the teachers don't know how to use them to advance their
<br>
students.
<br>
<p>I have watched my 5 year old in day-care.  He goes to an accelerated
<br>
Montessori 
<br>
Preschool program and is generally bored for most of the day.  At home
<br>
he gets the 
<br>
computer based instruction he calls fun and is completing programs
<br>
designed for 
<br>
second graders.  If he were provided with that kind of instruction all
<br>
day long 
<br>
who knows what his potential could be.  But even if one of use quit work
<br>
to home-school 
<br>
him.  His need for knowledge would quickly outpace our capability to
<br>
provide it.  Instead
<br>
he will go into public school be bored to tears, and probably go to
<br>
Ritalin to make
<br>
him be able to not be bored!  Our public school will not even give the
<br>
option of skipping a
<br>
grade.  Because the kids get picked on and are often not emotionally
<br>
developed enough for
<br>
second grade.
