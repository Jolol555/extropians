</em><br>
<p>I would say an extropian lifestyle is an individually driven
<br>
lifestyle. You live the way you do because you want to, and you
<br>
know and accept why you want it. Just as we can change the way we 
<br>
life to suit our desires, we can also (although it is far harder) 
<br>
change some of our desires to better fit our deeper values.
<br>
<p>This has little to do with science and technology; I think one can 
<br>
live a very extropian life without the latest gadgets, the 
<br>
important thing is to know what ends they are for (including, of 
<br>
course, the aesthetics many of us appreciate in elegant 
<br>
technology).
<br>
<p>Also, an ordinary hobby or other activity can be turned into
<br>
something extropian. My roleplaying hobby has evolved into both
<br>
scenario planning, networking with interesting people and
<br>
educating/discussing with them about future and present
<br>
technologies and political issues. It is still something that is 
<br>
fun and stretches the imagination, but it has also become 
<br>
something more. I think that is the key to making things 
<br>
extropian: they become more than they were.
