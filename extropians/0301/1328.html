<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;No, but your president and his fellows should think a little bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further. It's not enough to throw some bombs, when this just feeds the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops of another enemy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War against terrorism is not comparable with conventional wars. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means fighting against belief systems and against the causes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation of those people. Wars like this can not be won with bombs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You either win them in the minds or not at all. Therefore, the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent idea of Mr. Bush so far has been the &quot;coalition against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism&quot;. He now is going to destroy this coalition for no sensible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is comparable, in some ways, to every conventional war. Look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Afghanistan.
</em><br>
<p>Well, did the allied forces find bin Ladin? Did they destroy the Al-Qaida 
<br>
network? Not at all. Conventional military is good when you can input the 
<br>
coordinates of your enemy into GPS directed bombs, but they are worthless 
<br>
against an internation network of small groups in several countries.
<br>
<p>Today, Afghanistan is a devasteted country, were only a small area around 
<br>
Kabul is a relatively safe place. It only is because of the UN troops 
<br>
there who help the new regime to establish and maintain a lawful system. 
<br>
The farer away you get from Kabul, the less important all this becomes. 
<br>
There are still clans fighting about control, power and influence in 
<br>
their region. And many former Taliban are hidden among them.
<br>
<p>The main problems in Afghanistan have not been solved, yet. It will take 
<br>
decades to develop a civil and  democratic society in Afghanistan. This 
<br>
process will require a lot of personnel, money, tedious talks and 
<br>
development aid. But if we don't spend this aid, Afghanistan will fall 
<br>
back into its old system and be a wonderful shelter for every fanatic 
<br>
muslim group.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Theres no coalition, if all one wishes to do is avoid pissing-off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamic militants and their political and financial supporters. One has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to break eggs to make an omlette.
</em><br>
<p>The question is, if we will survive the counterstrike of the other 
<br>
chicken :-) How many young, politically mislead people from arabia will 
<br>
this &quot;omlette&quot; push into the fangs of Al-Qaida and other terrorist 
<br>
groups? How much more funds will these groups raise in islamic countries? 
<br>
<p>The bad news is, that the islamic militants have won the war of the minds
<br>
in their countries by providing schools, social aid and a meaning for 
<br>
their life. This gives them almost unlimited support. We, the western 
<br>
world, have to convince the majority of the people there, that it is far 
<br>
better not to follow those ideas of a closed belief system, but to go 
<br>
with us. We have to convince them, that we are not going to plunder their 
<br>
resources, destroy their culture, fight their religion, raise McDonalds 
<br>
temples on their holy ground. Difficult, when this has been told for 
<br>
years and has been supported by some bad attitudes. Currently, this war 
<br>
of the minds can not be won with military actions. Starting a war now is 
<br>
therefore a very unwise decision that will escalate the terror.
