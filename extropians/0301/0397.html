<p><em>&gt; So I think that some form of technological community integration tool would

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;all places are one place&quot; ilk:
</em><br>
<p><p>I think it would be a terrific idea to have one big &gt;H site, with news 
<br>
and articles, that we all coorporate on. And if such a site will come 
<br>
into existence I am willing to support it.
<br>
<p>But I am afraid that it is a doomed idea to make one site to cover it 
<br>
all. We are all very much individualists, and so want to do our own 
<br>
thing our own way. So we all want to be site owners.
<br>
<p>I believe that the best way to do this sort of thing instead, would be 
<br>
to have some sort of &quot;comunity license&quot; where we share our content 
<br>
freely. So that we could each put our articles online, and other sites 
<br>
could copy them. With a proper copyright notice in the bottom of the 
<br>
article.
<br>
<p>Something like:
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------
<br>
&quot;Article title&quot;, by author
<br>
This article first appeared on:
<br>
<a href="http://www.originalsite.org/articletitle.htm">http://www.originalsite.org/articletitle.htm</a>
<br>
This content is protected by the Transhumanist comunity license at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/comunity_license.htm">http://www.transhumanism.org/comunity_license.htm</a>
<br>
----------------------------------------
<br>
<p>That way we could get the best of both worlds, where authors can put 
<br>
something online, others can copy it and put it on their site, if they 
<br>
fullfill the comunity license. The comunity would get much more out of 
<br>
it's efforts. And every site owner would be working for their own little 
<br>
ego ;-)
<br>
<p>It would also be easier to make localized versions in out own language. 
<br>
Which I would like very much. I have a danish site screaming for 
<br>
content. On uninspired days it would be nice if I could just translate 
<br>
some article that is allready written.
<br>
<p>So I believe that we should look to create a comunity license instead of 
<br>
a big technical solution. It would be self organisation in a distributed 
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>If that works, we could then allways create some xml schemas so that the 
<br>
process could be automated.
<br>
