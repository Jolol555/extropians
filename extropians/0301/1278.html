<a href="mailto:naddy@mips.inka.de?Subject=Re:%20Euro%20Trash%20Talk,">naddy@mips.inka.de</a> writes: The raving US American nationalists that have 
<br>
largely hijacked this list since September 11, 2001 (and diverted it from 
<br>
Extropian themes to atavistic talk securely rooted in the frame of mind of 
<br>
the nation states from the first half of the 20th century--but I digress)
<br>
<p>Naddy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think you digressed, at least not very much if at all.  If 
<br>
America is reduced to an impotent mess exactly how do you think this will 
<br>
affect the world the Extropians are hoping to build.  When Europe is second 
<br>
in the list of people to be reduced to impotence where will the Extropian 
<br>
world be then.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or could you possibly mean that Sadaam and Osama will now turn into 
<br>
lambs and peaceably lie down together to chew their cuds?  If so I can't see 
<br>
how you could possibly come to that conclusion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interpretation, and this is surely no surprise, of your attitude is 
<br>
that you do see a threat to we Americans and you are quite willing to 
<br>
sacrifice America to your short term safety.  But me and many other Americans 
<br>
will not stand still to allow your vision for our future to come to pass.  
<br>
For that you pull out your curse, &quot;Nationalists.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say the time for talking is over I mean only that it is time 
<br>
for you to recognise that we not going to be destroyed by the likes of 
<br>
Sadaam/Osama without exerting ourselves to the fullest.  Nor or we going to 
<br>
be endlessly sidetracked into an impotent debate by Europeans that privately 
<br>
hate us and wish to see us fall -- like you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You called our position &quot;incrediably distorted.&quot;   I see yours as 
<br>
incrediably cold and self serving.  You want to see our citizenry killed, you 
<br>
want to see us threatened by further injury and you want to see us stand 
<br>
quietly until we are hurt again.  And, for what purpose, so someone you 
<br>
resent can get his just deserts.
<br>
Ron h.
