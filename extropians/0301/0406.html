<p>&quot;Yes.  A republic whose only reason for existence is to insure 
<br>
individual rights.  A minarchist view of a &quot;state&quot; is perfectly 
<br>
consistent with individual rights.&quot;
<br>
<p>I did not write the &quot;and????...&quot; comment actually, I was responding to that.
<br>
In fact my response was similar to yours.  I will try to make my quoting
<br>
more clear in my responses.  I agree that a minarchist (democratic
<br>
constitutional republic) is consistent with individual rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a difficult question to answer.  Is there ANY form of state that
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; moral?  Obviously most libertarians or anarchocapatialists would answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'no!'
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Most libertarians that I know are minarchists and thus would not 
<br>
necessarily answer &quot;no!&quot;&quot;
<br>
<p>True, upon further reflection I think more libertarians I have interacted
<br>
with could be considered 'minarchists' as opposed to anarcho-capitalist.
<br>
Which is fortunate, as the former seems much more feasible than the later in
<br>
ever actually getting implemented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am still attempting to create an informed opinion on this, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tentatively I would say that a government that exists only to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual civil liberties, protect against foreign threats, and ensures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights while not regulating the economy, science, or any moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions beyond those which threaten or assault person or property could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider, by me at least, moral.  It would need be a constitutional
</em><br>
republic
<br>
<em>&gt; as well, with severe limitations on what the majority can vote into law.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Yes.  This is a minarchist libertarian position.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that though, I certainly do believe that some states can be LESS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMMORAL than other states.  A democratic constitional republic with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialist policies (like the US) is definitely less immoral than any
</em><br>
garden
<br>
<em>&gt; variety corrupt despotic theocratic regime.  To not acknowledge that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variations of statehood are better than others, while still not being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *perfect* robs the people of the chance to create better states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Sure.  But once the State is assumed to supersede the rights of 
<br>
individuals and especially once the rights of individuals are 
<br>
seen as being contingent on and/or gifts given and limited by 
<br>
the State, the result will be utter loss of individual rights. 
<br>
The only question then is how quickly it will proceed to how 
<br>
horrific a conclusion.&quot;
<br>
<p>I was referencing the reverse situation, where the people had all-ready had
<br>
a complete and total loss of individual rights (as was the case in North
<br>
Vietnam, an oppressive totalitarian despotic regime)  It would be
<br>
preferrable that they got to live in a state that had more individual rights
<br>
than zero, and hopefully once they get some, they can work to get more.  I
<br>
do not agree that once an individual right is taken away a group of
<br>
individuals that the society immediately falls down a slippery slope into
<br>
one of no rights and complete oppression.  But there is always the threat
<br>
and the possibility that could occur and it should be fought every step of
<br>
the way.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
