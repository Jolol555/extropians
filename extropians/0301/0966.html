EurekAlert - Researchers achieve germline transmission of 'gene
<br>
knockdown' in mice
<br>
============================================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/cshl-rag011703.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/cshl-rag011703.php</a>
<br>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as an extremely versatile and
<br>
powerful tool in biomedical research. A new study published in the
<br>
February issue of Nature Structural Biology reports the creation of
<br>
transgenic mice in which inherited RNAi lowers or silences the
<br>
expression of a target gene, producing a stable &quot;gene knockdown.&quot; This
<br>
finding extends the power of RNAi to genetic studies in live animals,
<br>
and has far-reaching implications for the study and treatment of many
<br>
human diseases.

<p>Recently, John Brockman posed a query to readers in the form of an
<br>
imaginary memo from President Bush. The memo invited readers to play
<br>
Science Advisor to the President, and asked readers to suggest the most
<br>
pressing scientific issue confronting the United States and the world,
<br>
and how the White House can best address that issue. There's a strong
<br>
case that nanotechnology should top the list.

<p>Preimplantation diagnosis provides advance look at future of designer

technology already allows parents to select some of the genes they pass

genes, and traits, that have never existed. It is possible that our

<p>Science is developing ways to boost intelligence, expand memory, and
<br>
more. But will you be allowed to change your own mind? - The dawning age
<br>
of neuroscience promises not just new treatments for Alzheimer’s and
<br>
other brain diseases but enhancements to improve memory, boost
<br>
intellectual acumen, and fine-tune our emotional responses. &quot;The next
<br>
two decades will be the golden age of neuroscience,&quot; declares Jonathan
<br>
Moreno, a bioethicist at the University of Virginia. &quot;We’re on the

threshold of the kind of rapid growth of information in neuroscience

that was true of genetics 15 years ago&quot;...

TCS - Are You Better Safe Than Sorry?

<a href="http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&amp;CID=2051-011703N">http://www.techcentralstation.be/2051/wrapper.jsp?PID=2051-100&amp;CID=2051-011703N</a><br>
<p>Better safe than sorry. This is the crux of the precautionary principle.
<br>
The application of the principle manifests itself everywhere. There are
<br>
crash barriers along the highway and handrails along the staircase. But
<br>
the ladder of the traditional window cleaner does not have a handrail.
<br>
And the same is true for the ladders in sluices, which may give rise to
<br>
hair-raising spectacles of a passing skipper using the ladder to take
<br>
out his St. Bernard dog. We do take part in traffic, although it may
<br>
cost human lives. We finance the fire brigade via our taxes, but not
<br>
every house has a sprinkler installation. And at the apogee of the Cold
<br>
War, there were even people who did not possess a nuclear free shelter
<br>
in their backyard.
