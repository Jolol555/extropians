<em>&gt; Samantha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I personally don't think your &quot;feelings&quot; are anything for us to

base 
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; your head to even check that you are reporting them accurately.  So I
</em><br>
treat 
<br>
<em>&gt; them as just another rant.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I gave no rant.  I told you off for claiming I was just mouthing  empty
<br>
slogans as if I had no real thought (several posts accused 
<br>
all who think like I of this) or didn't really have any investment but was
<br>
just passing on something I presumably picked up by osmosis.&quot;
<br>
<p>Such as your opinions on Vietnam?
<br>
<p>&quot;Once again you now bob and weave&quot;
<br>
<p>Pot calling the kettle black?  You should hardly be one to accuse someone of
<br>
'bobbing and weaving' considering multilpe people on this list have
<br>
repeatedly asked you to justify your stance on Vietnam, especially when you
<br>
make clear statement about opposing murderous regimes (such as Hitler) in
<br>
WWII yet find the same attempt to oppose an even more murderous regime
<br>
'senseless' when considering Vietnam.  I also asked you multiple times what
<br>
you felt of the Korean war, and to compare and contrast it with the Vietnam
<br>
war.  Since I made a valient attempt to not come off as making personal
<br>
attacks or present my case in a condescending tone, I can only conclude that
<br>
you can not present the justification for your opinions on these matters and
<br>
thus choose to ignore them entirely.  Or perhaps a small seed of doubt has
<br>
been planted in the back of your mind that those anti-war protests you took
<br>
part in actually contributed to the mass murder of millions of Indochinese
<br>
people.  Perhaps you find this so disturbing that this is why you ignore
<br>
these comments and inquiries.  Or perhaps I have allready made it into your
<br>
'kill file'  Got to silence those dissenting opinions eh?  Or maybe im just
<br>
a promoter of 'anti-communist propoganda'
<br>
<p>&quot;I am done with your massive intellectual dishonesty&quot;
<br>
<p>Intellectual dishonesty?  I am still waiting to hear if you feel the korean
<br>
war was also 'senseless' and if it wasn't, why was it not senseless yet the
<br>
vietnam war was?
<br>
<p>The latest estimates are that the state of North Korea has killed 2 million
<br>
people in the recent famine. This would make it the worst state killing
<br>
since Cambodia in the 1970s. It would push the total killing by the
<br>
communist regime since its origin to about 4 million people, making
<br>
communist North Korea the 6th greatest killer since 1900. Compare North
<br>
Korea with South Korea, which started with similiar popuations and have
<br>
nearly identical climates, land area, people, and culture. Yet South Korea,
<br>
which embraced capitalism and democracy at the end of the Korean War is now
<br>
the 11th largest economy in the world, a bustling hub of progress and growth
<br>
which recently hosted the Olympics. North Korea, on the other hand, embraced
<br>
massive statism, it is the only full fledged communist state intact, its
<br>
people are desperately poor and millions have starved to death, while
<br>
factories and fields remain unused and empty it receives billions in
<br>
international aide while maintaining a standing army of 1 million with
<br>
artillary constantly aimed at South Korea's capital. A truly sad state of
<br>
affiars.
<br>
<p>Following is an excellent article by Reason Columnist Cathy Young on the
<br>
perception of communism in the west and in academic elites circles.  She
<br>
criticizes the west for not acknolwedgeing the heinous crimes of communism
<br>
(amounting to about 150 - 170 million murders this century) becuase the west
<br>
spent a good amount of time in political favor with many of these communist
<br>
leaders. Rejecting communism also entails the acceptance that the US efforts
<br>
during the cold war in Vietnam, Korea, Afghanastan and other areas were
<br>
morally justified (albiet, as she notes, imperefectly handled)  Given the
<br>
fact that more people died in the six months following the United States
<br>
removal from the Indochina region then in the entire conflict and
<br>
subsequently 1/3rd of the Cambodian population died from the corrupt,
<br>
communist, despotic, tyrannical regime which took over there, and that many
<br>
actions of US liberals and Academic elites directly supported and made these
<br>
events more likely to occur, its no wonder that those same people are
<br>
reluctant to admit that communism is as bad as Nazism.

<br>
By Cathy Young
<br>
<p>Young reviews Martin Amis' new book &quot;Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty
<br>
Million&quot; in which the author chronicles Soviet crimes against humanity and
<br>
questions the double standard between Nazism and Communism. 
<br>
<p>Excerpt - &quot;The left's reluctance to acknowledge that Communism wasn't just a
<br>
failure but an evil is due to more than stubbornness. Such an acknowledgment
<br>
would amount to (1) validating a view of the West, Communism's Cold War
<br>
adversary, as good (albeit imperfect), and (2) admitting that the left spent
<br>
much of the 20th century cozying up to mass murderers and therefore has
<br>
precious little moral authority to criticize the West today. And that's very
<br>
relevant to present-day global conflicts. &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Welcome to my killfile.&quot;
<br>
<p>On behalf of Samatha's kill file, MaxPLumm and I would like to welcome Ron H
<br>
as well.  Perhaps Mr. Lorrey will be soon joining us...
