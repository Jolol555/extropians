Rudiger says:
<br>
&lt;&lt;In my previous mail, I didn't offer an alternative. Here is one every
<br>
European: Do nothing and keep Iraq under embargo. Rationale: Mr.
<br>
Hussein is an old man. He has a few more years to go, at most. The
<br>
problem might just go away &quot;naturally&quot; just like Franko of Spain went
<br>
away. There is no guarantee that what follows Mr. Hussein is a
<br>
democracy with a free press and all the other freedoms we treasure. I
<br>
believe this is the way with the fewest victims.
<br>
<p>-Rüdiger&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>On the intelligence level of Bush, I am not sure myself. But mere 
<br>
intelligence and the capacity to deliver a thrilling speech, is as the 
<br>
ancient Greeks noted; is mere sophistry. As we Americans say: If you can't 
<br>
dazzle them with brains, baffle them with bullshit.
<br>
<p>Bill Clinton was a Rhodes scholar, a bright guy and a brilliant politician. 
<br>
Under his watch, he attempted to solve the Arab_israeli issue; which, because 
<br>
of who was participating, was an utter failure. The logic of a white guy in 
<br>
Washington, DC, didn't dovetail with a tough, determined, guerilla warriors' 
<br>
weltungshaung. To his credit Bill C. did do great on the economy, and no, it 
<br>
was not just luck.
<br>
<p>I voted for Clinton twice and Gore once, simply because I viewed W as his 
<br>
daddy's boy; another effete, inbred, WASP drooler; who owed his soul (so to 
<br>
speak) to the Oil companies. I have since (somewhat) regretted my voted for 
<br>
Al Gore, and not having voted for W. Bush.
<br>
<p>Saddam is not so old that he cannot hang on for years to come. His boyhood 
<br>
hero was Stalin and Joe Stalin massacred almost as many after the war as 
<br>
before. His son Uday seems more then willing to follow Daddy's governing 
<br>
philosophy and has helped carry out many of the executions over the last 15 
<br>
years. The legacy of tyranny will continue, with ceasing, apparently.
<br>
<p>If we do nothing as the Euros wish, Saddam or his son will likely aquire 
<br>
nuclear fission capability, with the likelihood of these fission weapons 
<br>
being &quot;enhanced:&quot; so that their detonation produces a double capacity yield. 
<br>
This is something like 30-40 kilotons versus the 12 and 20 kiloton yield 
<br>
delivered at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Plus, the North Koreans have developed 
<br>
an ICBM capability to carry this package to North America or Europe (IRBM) 
<br>
and appears more then willing, to sell the missiles themselves or the 
<br>
technical production plans.
<br>
<p>What you have advocated in your post is something I noticed in a column in 
<br>
the National Review; a rightist journal. That is, we have little danger that 
<br>
Euro's will become Hitler children; rather the danger is that they have 
<br>
become Neville Chamberlain's kinder.
<br>
<p>Yo have to decide what is right for you, and as an American nationalist, I 
<br>
have to decide what is smartest for the USA (Me and 280 million others). I am 
<br>
in the pro-war faction because I think I understand the enemies of the USA, 
<br>
and see no other choice but regime change, by hook or by crook.  At this 
<br>
point, with American support, what will come in Iraq, must be better then 
<br>
what is there now.
<br>
<p>So in the coming months, after the war, the Iraqi people will absolutely 
<br>
benefit more. More oil money for Iraqi stomachs, zero cash for Saddam's 
<br>
palaces. Plus a disarmed villain for the USA, plus a financial blow to the 
<br>
house of Saud, and their covert support of Wahabbi terrorism. Also, a 
<br>
psychological blow to the member of the Uma (Islamic Community) who believe 
<br>
that the US is a push-over, thus we gain some deterrence for a while (until 
<br>
we show ourselves as weak again).
<br>
<p>Its not the world of our choosing, but this is the world that is. Now we each 
<br>
make our choices and hope that we have made the wisest one.
