</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Lomborg debate provides just one example of where a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scoring over the opponent&quot; rather than, framing it in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;seeking a deeper understanding&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This choice, either to pursue &quot;point scoring&quot; or to pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;deeper understanding&quot; seems available to each of us each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  time we post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish I had a dollar for every time on this forum this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless sentiment has been expressed.
</em><br>
<p>I see very little sentiment (useless or otherwise) in the statements
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p>I certainly wasn't looking to do anything so pointless as express
<br>
mere sentiment. I hoped to highlight a fundamental choice that
<br>
each poster gets to make each time they post - to &quot;pursue point
<br>
scoring&quot; or to &quot;pursue deeper understanding&quot;.
<br>
<p>Do you think there is no such choice?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet it seems that there are STRUCTURAL aspects of a list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such as this, that make it hard for people to keep in mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; both that they HAVE this choice and that there are REAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consequences in how the choice is exercised
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really think that it would be any different in person?
</em><br>
<p>Yes I really do.
<br>
<p>I think that if people are talking face to face either one to one or
<br>
in groups that a differnent set of dynamics apply than apply on a
<br>
list where posts are sequential. I think a list structure favours the
<br>
&quot;point scoring&quot; mindest as opposed to the &quot;seeking deep
<br>
understanding&quot; mindset more than face to face does. It easier to
<br>
tell in the more context rich face to face environment if people are
<br>
serious, interested, in the middle of a conversation that matters to
<br>
them or merely shooting the breeze, and so in a face to face
<br>
circumstances I think the &quot;point scoring&quot; debater mindest would
<br>
stand out more balatantly as rude and damaging and that people
<br>
would therefore do it less as a consequence of the richer feedback
<br>
that they'd get.
<br>
<p>My point is essentially that lists are less forgiving, there is a natural
<br>
bias in them that favors &quot;point scoring&quot;, for the reasons I outlined,
<br>
and its worth being aware of this bias. Being aware may help us
<br>
counter it.

<p><em>&gt; Consider the exchange between Anders and Mike:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [Anders wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; One prerequisite for having a constructive discussion about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; powerful topic is to be able to handle it on a high level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; abstraction. When you know enough about a topic you can start to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; look at it from different sides. You can be abstract enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; it so that you become dispassionate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike replied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the contrary, the more you know about a topic, when that topic turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on Objective Truth, the more likely you are to be very passionate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the side which you are able to objectively, quantitatively, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; qualitatively determine is in the right. The opposition begins, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and more, to look not just wrong, but foolish, naive, stubbornly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obstinate in their willful ignorance, and willing to believe anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that agrees with their prejudices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's quite clear that the more someone learns about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue, the less affected is his or her basic personality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disposition!
</em><br>
<p>Not to me.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what your saying. It seems that, your saying that, as the
<br>
amount of knowledge one has on a subject increases one's personality
<br>
(or) personal disposition, is less (e)ffected by each further unit
<br>
increment.
<br>
<p>Either speaking generally or even having particular regard to
<br>
the example you've provided I can't see that your conclusion is justified
<br>
(even if I restated it correctly which I'm not sure about). It looks like
<br>
quite a big claim about the way knowledge effects personality.
<br>
<p>An interesting one though. I'd genuinely like to see you develop this if
<br>
you can and have a interest in doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Those who start by being quite opinionated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain that way, and those who tend to reserve judgment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have &quot;working hypotheses&quot;, be indecisive, and so on, tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to remain their way.
</em><br>
<p>I can't agree with the view that having a working hypothesis and
<br>
indecision amount to the same thing, which seems to be what
<br>
you are saying. Having a &quot;working hypothesis&quot; is in my view an
<br>
excellent example of balancing the need to be decisive so as
<br>
to act and learn in the world and the need to be open and aware
<br>
that ones assumptions are possibly invalid.
<br>
<p>There is nothing particularly indecisive about a working hypothesis
<br>
that I can see. With a working hypothesis one has usually taken the
<br>
trouble not only to recognize that one may be wrong, but to consider
<br>
some of the more likely areas in which their errors might reside. You
<br>
seem to me to be setting the bar for decisiveness so high that only an
<br>
entity that could never change its mind would be decisive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And neither speaker here is distinguishing between ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions of near-fact, and discussions laced with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I could hold someone to blame for not distinguishing
<br>
&quot;near-fact&quot; from anything. What is a near-fact? How near?
<br>
In a *subjective* or *objective* estimation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is *extremely* difficult not to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat biased perspective on the latter issues, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only a fool has such prejudices about matters of fact!
</em><br>
<p>But now you seem to be moving near-fact into fact. I'm
<br>
trying but I'm just not following. Maybe I'm thick or maybe
<br>
you are charging irreverently across ground that is more complex
<br>
then you see.     Maybe both :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with *all* of these further observations of Brett's:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<p>Ok. Good. If you, a person who certainly thinks for himself,
<br>
agrees with me on them, then I am more confident that my
<br>
observations may be valid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; First, RUDENESS, perceived or actual, intended or not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enkindles a strong desire to respond that may not be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emotional, but may have some intellectual basis - in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principle of &quot;tit for tat&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Second, quite naturally, people perceive and respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negatively not just to BLATANT personal attacks but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the subtler varieties. Ad hominem, or at least the essence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of it, can be packaged into sophisticated forms. The use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; insinuation and innuendo; selective excerpting; misleading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paraphrasing; even in the formulation of questions that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structured not to elicit discussion or serious consideration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but that are leading and that invite the other to impale or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ensnare themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When this occurs, I think it is a shame.  I feel fairly certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that NONE of the frequent posters to this list are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ACTUALLY as jaded, closed or cynical as some of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; postings could be taken to suggest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ridicule CAN be an effective tools in SOME forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; debate, but its use invites an IN-kind response and soon, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is difficult for either party to change tack and for genuinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; open questions to be asked. Passions inflamed are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; easily dowsed. Subtle slights and put-downs are remembered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems an original or initiating post, however carefully prepared,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to try and seek deeper understanding of an issue can be used as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; launching pad by any would-be debater.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The opportunity to selectively excerpt affords a ready means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of changing the frame of reference to that which is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suitable to the practice-debater's knowledge base. They need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only select any detail, however incidental to the original thrust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and reset the frame of reference to grounds more convenient to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the development and display of their debating skill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet, I do not think there is ANYONE who frequently posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to this list who could neatly or fairly be categorised as ONLY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interested in practicing their debating skills, or as only interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in pursuing and fostering deeper understanding. Indeed, the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approaches can be adopted at different times by the same person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and imo, sometimes, even by the same person at different points in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the one post.
