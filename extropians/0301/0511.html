<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, however, I note that your paragraph mentions nothing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the law---it's as if we are in some lawless space colonies, and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;are only interested in examining what we *approve* of.  But intervention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;is often an entirely different matter!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The law is an abstraction built up from the approvals and disapprovals of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;individuals, including approval and disapproval of the particular class of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;actions known as interventions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, no.  The law for the most part is not built up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this way.  It arises evolutionarily over the course of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization's existence.
</em><br>
<p>I apologize for a verbal ambiguity.  By &quot;built up&quot; I mean &quot;is an empirical 
<br>
regularity within&quot; and not &quot;is the causal result of&quot;.  The law is an 
<br>
abstraction from and empirical regularity within the approval and 
<br>
disapproval, of individuals, of certain kinds of interventions, taking 
<br>
into account that some individuals have more outright empirical power, 
<br>
including weaponry, than other individuals.  The history you cite below 
<br>
results in a certain pattern of people who believe they should and should 
<br>
not intervene, and people who won't intervene when others try to 
<br>
intervene; for example, if a police officer tries to stop a mugging it is 
<br>
not likely that a crowd of onlookers will react with shock and try to stop 
<br>
her.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Often laws will arise that can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be easily explained except as &quot;this is how it has always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been done&quot;, or &quot;stupid law, but unfortunately it's rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built-in now&quot;.  Sometimes these laws indeed have outlived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their purpose, but often they work in a subtle way that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not obvious to anyone, even though people will, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fabricate rationalizations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Um... nice recursion there, but you still haven't answered why your own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;intervening in this case is none of the law's business&quot; is in any wise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;more interesting than a libertarian's &quot;intervening in this case is BAD&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;nor indeed why they are not equivalent viewpoints.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amazing that we are not communicating better here ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now you are specifying that it is a *libertarian's*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgment about intervention.  Indeed, for a libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make such a judgment does happen to coincide a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with what is or is not someone's business.  But you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; began by asking how people answer their own question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they say &quot;Is it BAD?&quot;.  Such a question brings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into immediate play what one approves of and what one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not.
</em><br>
<p>So there is a cognitive difference in *which* disapprovals are produced, 
<br>
but the epistemological stance is the same?  (I ask because I had thought 
<br>
you were arguing that BAD was epistemologically ill-founded but &quot;none of 
<br>
my business&quot; was not.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are millions of examples where something is none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my business, and interference inconceivable, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are nonetheless very BAD in my opinion.  Abortion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infanticide are two such examples, but even such mundane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases as adultery and lying come to mind.
</em><br>
<p>So to you adultery is BAD, second-party intervention to stop adultery is 
<br>
WORSE, and a police officer arresting someone who threatens an adulterer 
<br>
with a pistol is GOOD?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's very easy in most cases to determine whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not something is my affair.  It's harder when as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislator---or as a citizen giving advice to legislators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or propping up memes I favor---to try to draw the correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bounds of modularity.  For some purposes, the apparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modular unit is the family; sometimes it's &quot;woman with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child&quot; (a sort of family).  At other times the efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to draw boundaries between modules is at the community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level, e.g., whose business is it if some small town 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere wishes to outlaw prostitution?  Only the citizens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say I.  (I hope that at this point no one says, &quot;Oh yeah?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if they decide to suspend habeas corpus or deny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious freedom?&quot;)   &lt;lecture on success of nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting constitutional rights suppressed for brevity&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hm... I think you need to separate out your supergoals from your subgoals 
<br>
here.  That's one of *my* least favorite epistemological confusions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;No.  How the laws are written, and hence who the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;will side with, cannot be settled by moral argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;The far less idealistic approach, which has been shown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;to be vastly more workable, has been to observe in what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;ways successful societies seem to maximize benefit and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;prosperity by having enormous regard for individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;citizen legal rights, and enormous regard for private
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;property.  To be sure, as Hayek explains, we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;be open to new experiments and ideas, however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Maximize benefit and prosperity for what class of entities?  If you aren't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;counting babies and simulations in the tally, then your assessment of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;works&quot; is based on a quite different metric for workingness.  I'm sure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that if you don't count slaves as people, then slaveowning societies can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be shown to maximize benefit and prosperity (for slaveowners) by having 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;enormous regard for &quot;private property&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good question!  Now it so happens that slave-owning societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not competitive, but let's consider a more challenging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example to my (and maybe your) world-view.  In the 1950s, 1960s,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 1970s, a lot of great economists, like Samuelson, believed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Soviet economic model was more productive than Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism.  In retrospect, this seems very foolish, but for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those of us alive then it appeared plausible.  The question then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could become---say if indeed the Soviet Union had truly begun to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supersede the West---might we not have to adopt some of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarian methods if we want to remain competitive?  The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could well have been &quot;yes&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That depends on whether you'd rather keep the light alive in yourself for 
<br>
as long as you can, even if it's doomed to eventually fade, rather than 
<br>
blow it out yourself to retain the illusion of being in control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that just makes my point!  Non-functioning societies or uncompetitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones aren't admissible to the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So historically we are brought to this:  extreme regard for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private property and individual legal rights works, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coincidentally provides the said entities of the time with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximal benefit and prosperity.  But the challenging question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is about the future, which I know concerns you and should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern all of us.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so we should have extreme regard for the individual legal rights of 
<br>
babies?  Incidentally, I think that while parents having control of 
<br>
children is often bad, having nonparents or governmental entities 
<br>
interfering is worse.  I don't say that it's none of my business; I say 
<br>
that my goal of protecting the child is best served by protecting the 
<br>
child from governers, not protecting the child from parents.  It's not a 
<br>
perfect solution, though.  I would - for example - look favorably on 
<br>
someone who released software that children could use to bypass parental 
<br>
restrictions on Internet access; I couldn't be on the child's side if I 
<br>
thought the child was the parent's property.  My theory here is that the 
<br>
child has full sentient rights, that a parent who shares 1/2 the child's 
<br>
DNA is statistically more likely to protect that child than a governer who 
<br>
shares none of the child's DNA, and that the child, who shares 1.0 of the 
<br>
child's DNA, is the best decider of all...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am just as much against ownership of a simulation as I would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;against the claim that you &quot;owned&quot; the proteins making up a sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you claimed was your &quot;slave&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;And one can see how it comes down to a difference in how societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;of equals should function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;No, it comes down to a difference in who we consider an &quot;equal&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's exactly right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't you feel lucky that there is such a clear distinction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans and other primates, and other mammals?
</em><br>
<p>Erm... I do feel somewhat lucky, but I think perhaps for different 
<br>
reasons.  My ethical system says that it might be a bad thing to create 
<br>
such halfways.  But I don't feel lucky because &quot;my ethical system would 
<br>
break down if it confronted halfways&quot;.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; As much as PETA might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to award citizenship to numerous other classes of creatures, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not practical.  So we allow humans to own other animals (and children,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up to a point).
</em><br>
<p>Not practical?  Only if your metric of moral fitness evaluates only human 
<br>
fun, which is in fact the very issue being discussed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So this is where we are, as we march into the unknown.  I'll discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem---practical for you, but not for me yet---of simulatees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in another post.
