<p>I'm not frustrated. Ron has made my killfile a while ago. The only way I
<br>
see his stuff is by proxy of other posters, and this is what I commented
<br>
on.

<p>Allright. Because I'm honestly missing the point of why a person with
<br>
Ron's background and Ron's beliefs would find this list worthwhile. He
<br>
might be not with Sauron, but he's certainly with Isengard.
<br>

<p>I don't need any extra evidence for secret evidence. Some pretty scary
<br>
stuff passes several times a day through my inbox. Anyone who engages 
<br>
Google for a few minutes can't miss it, unless he's not engaging Google, 
<br>
or wears rather selective blinders.

<p><em>&gt; substance and only 5% of the &quot;how can you be so naive&quot;

<p>He isn't naive. He's just with the enemy.
