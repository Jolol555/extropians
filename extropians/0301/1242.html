<em>&gt; &gt; The immediate effect on war would be negative, assuming that some people

<em>&gt; &gt; last one, so if there's a repeat, I would consider it a big negative (if

<em>&gt; &gt; a bus crashes and 10 people die is &quot;tragedy&quot;, and 3000 on WTC qualifies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for &quot;horrible, despicable event&quot; and 6,000,000 gets a &quot;holocaust&quot;, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 100,000 probably hits around &quot;unbelievable massacre&quot; label or so). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't forget the &quot;Iraq/Iran war&quot; level.  About 200,000 thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been killed *before* the &quot;war of attrition&quot; began.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/war/iran-iraq.htm">http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/war/iran-iraq.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nice history of the whole war.  In total, about a million died,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There would also be a sizable negative property score for damaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; buildings in Iraq, probably a sizable positive property score to the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military business and to world media businesses, some points for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enjoyment of &quot;marines getting some action&quot;, some for the US population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feeling safer, some subtracted for some of the US population feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guilty, and a sizable negative score for Iraqi suffering at the loss of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relatives and friends, but none of those (except maybe by the last one),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would think, would put much of a dent on the -100,000 full points that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we started with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You also need to score (a) the relief that many Iraqis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will feel when Hussein is gone
</em><br>
<p>countered by the number of iranians that would be pissed off with him
<br>
going, and would be upset about whoever replaced him.  Are these numbers
<br>
lower or higher than the ones you quote?  I don't know.  My guess is
<br>
that few people know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  (b) the potential for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many further deaths over the rest of his and his son's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives, 
</em><br>
<p>countered by the number of potential deaths caused by his replacement. 
<br>
Same note as before applies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and (c) the (admittedly unquantifiable) benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could accrue to other nations, especially Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones, in the region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Countered, again, by the equally unquantifiable problems that would be
<br>
caused by his replacement.  All of these are part of the post-war
<br>
effects I didn't know how to assign probabilities and weights to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now, since the post-war effects are unknown, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can't assign probabilities to what the possible outcomes will be (if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can, please post), they would have to be given a neutral or zero score. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In which case the war stays at &quot;unbelievable massacre&quot; level, and should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be a no-go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having good judgment about the myriads of factors is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that I believe can be left to the professionals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are employed by the various governments;  that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professionals will not agree, however, bespeaks both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulty of any final say, and the ideological component,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is based ultimately on differing values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
They would use a different criteria, I imagine.  It would probably weigh
<br>
more heavily the benefits to the members of whatever government they
<br>
belong to, and probably lower the benefits to the people that live in
<br>
Iraq.  It's also likely to contain elements which we wouldn't care much
<br>
about like benefits of their decision to their personal career, opinion
<br>
of their superiors, since it affects their personal career mentioned
<br>
above, benefits to their personal financial situation, if any, benefits
<br>
to relatives and friends, etc.  I believe we have no option but to leave
<br>
it to them, since we are completely powerless in the matter.  This
<br>
doesn't mean we have to agree with their decision.
