<p>
Brett expresses some observations very similar to my own with this list.  To
<br>
me, it is dissapointing to see so much intellectual energy spent on debating
<br>
games, one-upsmanship, and displays of prowess.
<br>
<p>I notice that many of the more thoughtful posters have adopted a strategy of
<br>
posting an interesting contribution or comment, but generally not engaging
<br>
in responses to the less productive games mentioned above.  This is probably
<br>
an optimum strategy given the current list dynamics, but far less than what
<br>
could be achieved.
<br>
<p>I continue to read almost all messages on this list, because I continue to
<br>
find gems of insight and information almost daily. But I dream of what might
<br>
be possible if we worked together, with the purpose of discussion and debate
<br>
first to establish some common understanding, and then to clarify and
<br>
highlight differences and follow up on them.
<br>
<p>Human nature being what it is, each person tends to see their own viewpoint
<br>
as more valuable than the other's.  Language being what it is, people tend
<br>
to take offense or feel slighted, when no offense was intended.
<br>
Understanding being what it is, we each come from our own perspective and
<br>
base of pre-existing knowledge and filters, and tend not to see that the
<br>
other person's knowledge base and filters are equally valid -- to them.
<br>
<p>Brett's point about the most recent comment carrying the greatest perceived
<br>
value is an important one.  It's inherent in the serial nature of a list
<br>
such as this.  Another weakness of this serial structure is that old
<br>
information must be restated again and again.
<br>
<p>One possible way to improve the effectiveness of information sharing on this
<br>
list might be to create a web-based structure of shared knowledge to
<br>
complement the discussion on this list.  It may be time now for an extropian
<br>
wiki site.
<br>
<p>It would allow us to capture knowledge and build upon it.  The
<br>
non-centralized nature of a wiki would allow anyone (who cared enough) to
<br>
create their own pages and link to others.  During discussion on the current
<br>
list, people could conveniently point to links on the wiki to provide added
<br>
depth or clarification. It would prevent a lot of repetition, and having to
<br>
get the last word.
<br>
<p>What do others think?  Is it time?
<br>
<p>- Jef
