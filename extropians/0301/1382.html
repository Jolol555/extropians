</em><br>
<p>Why would such negative consequences be of concern to the US?  (Also,
<br>
why should the US taxpayer foot the bill for this?)  What would those
<br>
negative consequences be?  Perhaps also it would be nice for the
<br>
Europeans to fend for themselves.

<p><em>&gt; Or you could be right. But--if you truly believe

</em><br>
<p>I don't think one has to divine motives or just one motive to US troops
<br>
being in Europe.  I think mostly they're there now, when the original
<br>
reason for them being there (the Soviet threat) is long gone just
<br>
because of institutional inertia.  Granted, political and financial*
<br>
interests also impinge here, but imagine if there were no US troops or
<br>
bases in Europe.  Those same interests would have an uphill battle
<br>
convincing all of us -- Americans and Europeans alike -- that they now
<br>
need to be there, especially in large numbers.
<br>
<p>My point: institutional arrangements often channel special interests.
<br>
There might be good and bad reasons for doing something, but one has to
<br>
look at the context of these things.
<br>
<p>Cheers!

<p>* Some of the biggest proponents of NATO expansion are from the Halls of
<br>
that &quot;Axis of Corporate Evil&quot; -- to use Justin Raimondo's term --
<br>
Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon.  For example, the US Committee to
<br>
Expand NATO was cofounded by Bruce P. Jackson and Randy Scheunemann.
<br>
Following the money: Jackson is a VP at Lockheed Martin and Scheeunemann
<br>
is a registered agent for the same.  The rub here is that new NATO
<br>
members have to upgrade their militaries, which means business for --
<br>
you guessed it! -- defense contractors.  (Perhaps to call this &quot;evil&quot; is
<br>
a bit much.  After all, one would expect merchants of death, by nature,
<br>
to want to sell weapons and other military systems.  So, in a mixed
<br>
economy, they would lobby for whatever it takes to sell their wares.)
