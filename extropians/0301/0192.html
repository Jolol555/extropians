<p>
Brett explains why a number of careful thinkers go ballistic
<br>
when they hear the word &quot;belief&quot;.  I had always wondered about
<br>
that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Some people] have not yet separated themselves from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superstition and when they stick their uncritical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unweighted, propositions in each others faces they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so proclaiming all too often, all too proudly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as though it were a great virtue in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;this is what I  BELIEVE !&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>It is perhaps significant that I don't ever recall anyone using
<br>
the word in this manner, and I have even entertained a number
<br>
of religionists who've knocked at the door.  That is *so*
<br>
mindless, that perhaps it's a vanishing usage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IMO, &quot;beliefs&quot;, by their very nature, and as opposed to reasons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are ultimately counter-social.
</em><br>
<p>I know what you mean, and you know what I and other sensible
<br>
people mean when we say &quot;believe&quot; or &quot;belief&quot;.  It has been
<br>
a useful conveyor of the amount of certainty the speaker feels.
<br>
One customarily speaks even of &quot;degrees of belief&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They build barriers between people.  Whereas reason through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the medium of language can potentially build bridges.
</em><br>
<p>Do you really have evidence in your personal life that
<br>
people you talk to are handicapped in this way?  I'm willing
<br>
to trust you, but it seems to me that this is a nice theory
<br>
that has no real utility.  For example, people whose thinking
<br>
is screwed up anyway aren't going to be magically helped by
<br>
dropping a certain term and fishing around for synonyms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please do consider ditching &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings&quot; from your operating language when other terms are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available.
</em><br>
<p>Do you believe in Sapir/Whorf?  By that I mean the hypothesis
<br>
that our vocabulary and grammar greatly influence our thoughts?
<br>
I only weakly believe in it; sure, a lot of our thought would
<br>
be impossible without language, and I also believe that the
<br>
speakers of some languages, e.g. Japanese and French, end up
<br>
with a tiny few differences from those of us who's primary
<br>
language is English.
<br>
<p>Oops.  Sorry.  I used &quot;the word&quot; twice without realizing it
<br>
there!  (Yes, the third time was deliberate.)  But you know
<br>
exactly what I mean.  The purpose of language is to convey
<br>
our thoughts.
<br>
<p>Now this is a different matter entirely from my own suggestion
<br>
that people stop referring to &quot;rights&quot; in the abstract.  I
<br>
consider that to be an indicator that the speaker believes
<br>
(sorry) in &quot;Absolute Right and Wrong&quot;, just as if he or she
<br>
were relying on Authority.  But I don't care if someone, even
<br>
me, actually uses it in sentences when the meaning steers
<br>
clear of absolutism.
<br>
<p>I do have one friend who used to get a very worried look
<br>
on his face whenever I or others used the word &quot;belief&quot;.
<br>
He gave up on that some years back; I think he knows what
<br>
we mean.  But he never explained it as well as you did.
<br>
Thanks.
<br>
<p>Lee
