</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok Dan you got me :-)  Having seen the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper was 28 pages I was not super-inclined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to read it,
</em><br>
<p>I'll have to see if Horwitz can come out with a Cliff Notes version.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but in a manner that has some resonance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a theme in the paper itself, (that &quot;family
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would not do for &quot;anonymous&quot; others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in society),
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  After all, if it were just like any other relation, it
<br>
wouldn't be family.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have now read the paper due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional impetus of you (an extropian I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You presume correctly -- according to me, though I wonder if others
<br>
would agree with my self-categorization here.:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; wanting to discuss it. Without your interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and prompting I would almost certainly have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chosen to have invested my time in reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something else.
</em><br>
<p>I hope you got something from the paper.  (See &quot;The Functions of the
<br>
Family in the Great Society&quot; by Steven Horwitz
<br>
<a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/Functions.htm">http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/Papers/Functions.htm</a> )  Now, I wouldn't look
<br>
at it narrowly as just about family, but also as a paradigm for
<br>
extending Hayekian views beyond the market.  This might be a fruitful
<br>
approach to studying other social phenomena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What we do now, that you (I presume:-) )and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I, have read it,
</em><br>
<p>I have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not sure though. Any conversation we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might now be based on a specific knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the paper that might be hard for others who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have the time or inclination to read it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow. This offers a poor return on investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort for a &quot;social politician&quot; like myself but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the hell.
</em><br>
<p>It depends.  If your goal is merely to talk about what other people are
<br>
talking about, then you should only read such things when others talk
<br>
about them.  I assume that's not your only motivation for reading or
<br>
learning.
<br>
<p>I also believe others might be inclined
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Horwitz, sets as background the notion that there has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some &quot;grand debate&quot; around &quot;the question of the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus the state&quot;. He invokes Hayek as am eminent thinker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this area and points out that its generally accepted that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;the market and the state do not exhaust all possible sets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of social institutions&quot; and that amongst these is the family.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is kind of an assumption made by many that Hayek's thought
<br>
and perhaps that of other Austrian economists can only apply to markets
<br>
and market phenomena.  Communities, families, and the like are to some,
<br>
such as Hodgson, outside this scope, so a usual tact is to diminish
<br>
Hayek and the others -- as if their ideas only apply to a thin sliver of
<br>
human existence.  This has also been used to attack individualism -- by
<br>
saying &quot;maybe markets work that way, but people in general don't.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think Horwitz's thrusts are essentially correct, if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly profound, but then often things do look a lot more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious *after* they have been reasonable well explained.
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  Once one separates form and function here, one can see
<br>
that the changing forms of families -- or the change in which form
<br>
predominates -- might be a bad thing.  As he points out, many
<br>
conservatives tend to think only a certain form of family is correct and
<br>
totally ignore function -- or believe the only proper functions can be
<br>
carried out in one particular form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that as  transhumanists and extropians are strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned with shaping and choosing from possible futures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and with taking what has served us well in the past forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whilst modifying or dropping what has no longer serves us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well that the paper makes some interesting suggestions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point on the prudence of decoupling function and form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family seems sound.
</em><br>
<p>I raised another point in my reply to Anders.  This is that changing
<br>
human nature or the context in which we live might also lead to further
<br>
changes in family -- ones unplanned.  (This is one of the key themes of
<br>
Hayek: unintended orders arise.  I do not believe full control -- full
<br>
planning is possible -- so there'll always be some aspect of spontaneous
<br>
ordering in our lives, be they human or posthuman.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imo, the functions of family will largely remain important going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward. Whilst the forms of family are, will and should change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this is still not an area of strong interest to me personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I am especially open to alternative views as I have barely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formed any views of my own at all.
</em><br>
<p>I can understand that.  I'm interested in economics and spontaneous
<br>
social orders.  I think you can use this is an instance to see how
<br>
something can be analyzed and this might be applied to other things --
<br>
things you might find more interesting.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
<p>Dan
