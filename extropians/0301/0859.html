D. Broderrick noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Well, to return this to the original context of America unilaterally
<br>
invading Iraq because *Al-Qaida* committed a terrible crime against
<br>
Americans and others in their vicinity: What I'd *hope*  is that we don't
<br>
immediately set out to invade Zimbabwe on the grounds that awful people run
<br>
the place, and we really hate awful people because some awful people that we
<br>
can't find did an awful thing to us.
<br>
Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My understanding is that the hijackers practiced their craft in Iraq at the 
<br>
behest of the Iraqi government, as nothing goes on there, withou the Master's 
<br>
or Uday's knowledge.
<br>
The hijackers supposedly practiced on mock (aircraft interiors) in Iraq until 
<br>
they were comfortable with the practice.  My point is; why bleed for the 
<br>
injustice of the invasions, if it accomplishes:
<br>
A better government in Iraq (less murder and torture)
<br>
Better distribution of oil wealth to the various people that comprise Iraq
<br>
A cut to the Wahabbis who fund Jihadi Terrorism worldwide-less $ for oil 
<br>
sales
<br>
A shockwave through the uma (islamic world community) that the West is 
<br>
watching.
<br>
A chance for some Muslims to re-invent themselves as moderates-good choice
<br>
Less money for global terror (see above)
<br>
Removing a paying client of North Korea's Kim Jung IL
<br>
<p>The downside is the cost in human life, but that is true in any abrupt, 
<br>
untimely death.
<br>
The possibility to make a slightly safer world. Perhaps this win might give 
<br>
energy to a truce and settlement of Israel and Arab issues too. Not with the 
<br>
current regime on the PLO side though. It seems that decapitating Iraq has 
<br>
more benefits then problems, even long-term.
