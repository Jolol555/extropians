<p>&quot;We pulled out of a senseless war.  Our handling of that war had more than a 
<br>
little to do with the final outcome.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, the fact that we cut off aid to Indochina at a time when the Soviets 
<br>
were substantially increasing aid to the North Vietnamese played the decisive 
<br>
role in the outcome of the war. But perhaps you would like to elaborate on 
<br>
your point of view here.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The US had no legitimate business in Vietnam to start with.&quot;
<br>
<p>But according to you, they did. You said earlier that &quot;I consider war 
<br>
honorable to stop a major and highly expansionist evil such as Hitler.&quot;
<br>
<p>Our efforts in Vietnam, like in Korea, Afghanistan, Greece, and a host of 
<br>
other theatres were to stop the spread of Soviet expansionism and influence. 
<br>
The Soviets were without question the biggest winners of the Vietnam War, as 
<br>
their chief rival was humiliated and temporarily incapacitated, in addition 
<br>
to the fact that they were able to construct their largest military 
<br>
installation outside of the USSR in Cam Rahn Bay in what had been South 
<br>
Vietnam. If going to war to stop Hitler was the proper course, then surely 
<br>
attempting to curb the activities of a regime which controlled more territory 
<br>
and killed more people was also justified.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Our actions there , including our illegal actions in neighboring countries 
<br>
gave fuel to Pol Pot.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, I'm not really sure what you mean by &quot;fuel&quot;, but how about the WEAPONS 
<br>
AND TRAINING that the North Vietnamese gave Pol Pot? Whatever propaganda 
<br>
victories Pol Pot was able to gain as a result of the US bombing campaign 
<br>
pales in comparison to the vital support he received in terms of supplies 
<br>
from the Communists. And, as David Chandler in his biography on Pol Pot 
<br>
pointed out (and others have done in other books), THE NORTH VIETNAMESE 
<br>
CREATED THE KHMER ROUGE. If you want to blame someone for the destruction of 
<br>
Cambodia, look at Hanoi, not Washington.  
<br>
<p>&quot;The rest of your laundry list in no way 
<br>
justified what we did there or that we were there at all.  I do 
<br>
not see how anyone could judge the reasons and consequences to 
<br>
this country (US) as anything other than senseless.&quot;
<br>
<p>You don't find our actions to stop Hitler senseless. I doubt the people of 
<br>
France do either. I find it hard to believe that the South Koreans would 
<br>
consider our actions of 1950 senseless. If these actions were all justified, 
<br>
then so too was our involvement in Vietnam. Our failure to stop the 
<br>
Communists there does not diminish the nobility of the effort.
<br>
<p>&quot;Puhleeze, we are not going in there for the sake of the Iraqi 
<br>
people.  Pretense that we are is sickening.&quot;
<br>
<p>So what? We didn't send troops or aid into Korea, Afghanistan, Greece, or 
<br>
Europe during World War II because we were being altruistic. All of these 
<br>
actions were in the best interests of the United States first and foremost. 
<br>
Yet, all of the above parties benefited from our actions. Are the 
<br>
improvements in the quality of life that these people enjoy somehow 
<br>
diminished because our first concern was not their well being?
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;At every turn we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with 
<br>
America and little that is right.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
