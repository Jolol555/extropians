<p>
I discovered this weekend something that should cause rational
<br>
thinkers everywhere to rejoice: a new television series from
<br>
Showtime with Penn &amp; Teller, called &quot;Bullshit!&quot;.  The show
<br>
promises to debunk and ridicule much of the popular nonsense
<br>
tolerated, even celebrated, by our culture.
<br>
<p>The first show &quot;Talking to the Dead&quot; took direct aim at psychics
<br>
who claim that ability.  Naming names and pulling no punches,
<br>
they took on Jonathan Edward (host of &quot;Crossing Over&quot;) and James
<br>
von Praagh (host of &quot;Beyond&quot;) directly, showing how they used the
<br>
techniques of cold reading, how they gather information about
<br>
their audience from outside sources, how the shows are edited to
<br>
show only successes, and how they go out of their way to avoid
<br>
scrutiny.  They even debunked the idea that they offer harmless
<br>
entertainment, with Penn Gilette offering a heartfelt tirade
<br>
about how these con artists are robbing people of the honest
<br>
memories of their dead loved ones by filling their heads with
<br>
bullshit.
<br>
<p>Future shows promise to take on alternative medicine, alien
<br>
abductions, second-hand smoke, and other topics.  I'm glad
<br>
Showtime showed a little backbone in producing the show and in
<br>
keeping the title; I hope they show similar courage in footing
<br>
the bill for the inevitable legal challenges that will follow.
<br>
It's probably too much to hope that many true believers will be
<br>
enlightened, but at least some of the con artists who prey on
<br>
the weak and gullible will be exposed to the light of day, and
<br>
perhaps it will encourage other media outlets to show some
<br>
brains and integrity and stop pimping these charlatans.
