<p>As far as I could tell, there was no way the UN,
<br>
the US or anyone else could have stopped that
<br>
massacre.  There was not a central leader on
<br>
any side urging them on, but rather a situation
<br>
where everyone wanted to kill.  Having great
<br>
numbers of troops in their midst still would not
<br>
have stopped that madness.  I see no point
<br>
in beating ourselves up over a nation that was
<br>
determined to commit suicide.  There really is
<br>
no logical way to blame the west.  The little
<br>
guy takes the blame.  spike
