<em>&gt; &gt; It isn't sane to wish to leave WMD in the hands of a madman any

</em><br>
<p>Saw a funny editorial cartoon the other day. Kim Jong Il is foaming at
<br>
the mouth, crazed eyes, in a straightjacket which is chained to the
<br>
floor and he is trying to wrestle his way out of it with several nukes
<br>
and missiles standing behind him. Several suits labeled as &quot;UN arms
<br>
inspectors&quot; are standing there, and one says to the other, &quot;Do you
<br>
think we can positively spin this as 'Kim is exercising restraint?'&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you think a proven madman, who has used WMD on innocent civilians of
<br>
his own country in the past, whose equally insane sons are documented
<br>
to be serial rapist/murderers and are in line for the leadership of
<br>
their country, is anybody we should be taking ANY chances with
<br>
whatsoever, it is YOU who has the screwey value system, not me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whoever would attack on the current mostly lack of grounds is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irresponsible beligerent. A country that proposes to do so is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting in a rogue manner.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, you failed your moral equivalency exam. If you haven't been
<br>
paying attention to the past 13 years of history, we are in a state of
<br>
belligerency that dates back to the first Bush administration which was
<br>
INSTIGATED by Saddam, not us. I can understand your lack of ability to
<br>
follow a chain of events.
