From: &quot;estropico&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:estropico@virgilio.it?Subject=Re:Why%20does%20the%20USA%20still%20have%20troops%20in%20rich%20Europe?">estropico@virgilio.it</a>&gt;
<br>
X-Mailer: YaBB
<br>
<p><p>A number of reasons. None sufficient by itself to explain &quot;why does the USA
<br>
still have troops in rich Europe&quot;, but together they could begin to shed some
<br>
light...
<br>
<p>Europeans save money that way (significantly smaller % of GDP is spent on
<br>
the military than in the US). That way we can go on pouring cash into our
<br>
expensive welfare state...
<br>
<p>Europe's wellbeing remains vital to american economic interests. The Russian
<br>
threat has mostly dissolved, but things could still go wrong and not
<br>
necessarily with Russia (see the Balkan wars, which the EU was clearly unable
<br>
to deal with).
<br>
<p>The troubled and oil rich Middle East and Central Asia are more easily reached
<br>
by US troops from a German base than from an American one.
<br>
<p>The US does not have to come to terms with another military superpower, such
<br>
as what the EU could become (over some considerable time) if the political
<br>
will was present.
<br>
<p>A military ally that was as strong as the US (or anywhere near) would rise a
<br>
whole set of problems neither side really wish to confront.
<br>
<p>A unified military policy for European nations is years away, despite the
<br>
first tentative steps being taken, such as the set up of a joint rapid
<br>
reaction force.
<br>
<p>I'm sure there's more!
<br>
<p>Cheers,                                                                       
<br>
Fabio                                                                         
<br>
<p>PS: The Roman empire grew out of violent conquest, but had also win-win
<br>
aspects: subject to roman control, pay your taxes and you'll have the
<br>
stability and access to markets necessary to prosper. It worked for centuries.
