<em>&gt; &gt; Anyhow, about the price of oil, one big factor in price is taxes. No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suprise there. However I suggest that the relationship might be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little different than one might first assume. Huh? Surely if you tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oil, the price goes up. Perhaps, perhaps not. Here is my reasoning:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; i.   Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rise. iii.  Alternatives to oil based products appear a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;      cheaper. I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;      instead of driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iv.  Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; v.   Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vi.  To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, assume for a minute that the increased tax revenues taken in by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taxing the oil are used to displace some other tax burden (yes, yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an unlikely scenario). Then:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a.   The nation sees no net change in the tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b.   The nation sees a net decrease in the price of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; c.   The oil producing country has a little less income from oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The net effect: a reduction in the price of oil from the nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perspective. I.e. by taxing crude oil an oil importing country can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trim some of the windfall profits from the oil exporting country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### The net effect would be a reduction in economic efficiency - instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using cheap oil, and having more resources left for e.g. science, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leisure, the economy (meaning every company and every individual) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend resources (time, energy, scientific effort) to reduce energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption (forgoing some pleasures, like having a well-lit home, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warm bedroom), or produce more costly energy. At the same time, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil-producing country would have less money to spend on products made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the oil user, reducing trade, and reducing economic activity in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries. A clear loss for all parties.
</em><br>
<p>An important part of my scenario is the displacement of one type of tax 
<br>
(income tax) with another type of tax (the tax on oil). There is no *net* 
<br>
additional burden in what I described so there is no reason for every company 
<br>
and every individual to expend resources in reducing energy consumption. 
<br>
Unless it happens the companies and individuals see an opportunity to keep a 
<br>
little more money in their pockets by cutting back in their consumption of 
<br>
those oil based products (note - not just energy). Remember, supposedly those 
<br>
companies and individuals paid as much less in income taxes as the additional 
<br>
amount they are paying on the oil based products.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You could use the same reasoning regarding e.g. taxes on bananas. Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bananas can be produced only in countries with the right climate, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a windfall, like oil, with growing of bananas being like pumping of oil, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere exploitation of a natural resource. I hope you can see the analogy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One might want to cut the windfall profits and spur domestic fruit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production by taxing bananas - but why do it? Trade, whether in bananas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil, manufactured goods, or &quot;natural products&quot;, is good. No need to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goose laying golden eggs.
</em><br>
<p>You can't apply this reasoning to bananas since there are no windfall profits 
<br>
in bananas. The price of a banana on the shelf in an American store reflects 
<br>
the labor of the growers, shipping costs and not a whole lot else. Banana 
<br>
growers do o.k. but they aren't raking in billions of windfall profits to my 
<br>
knowledge. The revenue made by the oil producing nations on the other hand is 
<br>
largely windfall and only a tiny fraction is in infrastructure investment and 
<br>
labor. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Say no to commodity taxes!
</em><br>
<p>I agree, except when a hugh part of the money being spent on that comodity is 
<br>
a massive windfall to whomever controls the resource and not money going to 
<br>
reward the labors of people creating the comodity.
<br>
<p>Also, personally I'd trade income tax for windfall taxes any day.
<br>
