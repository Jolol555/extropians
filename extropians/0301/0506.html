I guess if Quaoar is not a planet this is not a problem.
<br>
<p>It's the same question as is Australia a continent or an island.
<br>
<p>Generically speaking there are currently and probably always extremely few
<br>
bodies with a &quot;rough&quot; orbit around the Sun that are large (thus we exclude
<br>
moons like Jupiter's). To the general public Pluto is a planet and Charon is
<br>
its moon. There ain't too many bodies the size of Pluto nearby us.
<br>
<p>Whatever the official rules are as set recently the general consensus for
<br>
several hundred years has been that planets have the names of Roman deities.
<br>
If Gaia is confusing because of the associations with Earth's biosphere and
<br>
various related theories, Juno would be perfect, even fitting in with the
<br>
modern requirements as the goddess of childbirth.
<br>
<p>I do like your logic though. As a matter of humour, perhaps Pluto should
<br>
change it's name when within Neptune's orbit and when beyond it.
<br>
<p>All I can say is that the newspaper headlines across the world did not read
<br>
&quot;Quaoar - new Kuiper Belt object discovered&quot; but &quot;Quaoar - new planet
<br>
discovered&quot;. At least the six or seven articles I read said that.
<br>
<p>Culturally, the real test of whether it's defined as a &quot;planet&quot; will be what
<br>
school kids gets taught in their e-ink textbooks in five years time. That
<br>
means it rests with the writers of school books, who are often generalists
<br>
[at least until about 20 years from now when things start to get strange].
<br>
<p>I should check what the Chinese call their planets. The question of naming
<br>
(original, translated, and applied) is wickedly interesting. I've always
<br>
wanted a dictionary with original name, original phonetic spelling, original
<br>
precise translation, intermediary translations/forms and current status. For
<br>
example, Genghis Khan means &quot;Oceanic Lord&quot;, Pharoah &quot;Great House&quot;, Jupiter
<br>
(one translation) &quot;Shining Father&quot;, Augustus &quot;Sublime&quot;, Ahura Mazda &quot;Wise
<br>
Lord&quot;, Thebes = Waset (official) or Niwt &quot;The City&quot;. It may be that English
<br>
is an &quot;accretion language&quot; because of its use of its large use of adoptive
<br>
words (I'm not sure though, although I get the feeling that for example the
<br>
Celts language was internally more like an Amerindian, with names equivalent
<br>
to &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; or &quot;Big Horse&quot; - it's certainly true of their tribal
<br>
names).

<p><p><em>&gt; avatar wrote,

<em>&gt; &gt; Thanks very much for the info Harvey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, if  &quot;Objects sufficiently outside Neptune's orbit that orbital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stability is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonably assured for a substantial fraction of the lifetime of the
</em><br>
solar
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system are given mythological names associated with creation&quot; where did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Pluto and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Charon come from? Probably this rule did not apply when Charon was
</em><br>
named?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand the problem.  Pluto and its moon Charon are not outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the orbit of Neptune.  They cross the orbit of Neptune.  Therefore they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't get mythological names associated with creation.  They fall under
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; rule for &quot;Objects crossing or approaching the orbit of Neptune and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stabilizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resonances other than 1:1&quot; which &quot;are given mythological names associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underworld.&quot;  This seems to fit Pluto and Charon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If consistency had been respected, for example, Ge (Greek form, Roman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gaia) - mother of Uranus -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should have been chosen, rather than Quaoar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quaoar is outside the orbit of Neptune, so it gets one of the
</em><br>
&quot;mythological
<br>
<em>&gt; names associated with creation&quot;.  Quaoar is not considered a planet
</em><br>
because
<br>
<em>&gt; it is in the Kuiper belt with a lot of other similar object.  Greek
</em><br>
deities
<br>
<em>&gt; are used for the major planets and the above rules are used for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trans-Neptunian Objects.  The rules were carefully chosen so that &quot;Pluto&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;Charon&quot; fit the rules for planets and TNOs.  They are both Greek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deities and mythological names associated with the Underworld.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see what is inconsistent here.
