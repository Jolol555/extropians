</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly not as much so as we might like), and the organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for the attack was routed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I see no point in the entanglement of the two conflicts or 
<br>
attitudes toward them.  I do not see that unmitigated good came 
<br>
from the attack on Afghanistan.  I would not call it &quot;victory&quot; 
<br>
when the people are left massively impoverished and at the mercy 
<br>
of the old warlords.  I don't see how it was a &quot;victory&quot; when 
<br>
our stated objective kept shifting to attempt to make it one and 
<br>
we still never captured or accounted for the state objective, 
<br>
bin Laden.  I don't see how it is an unmitigated good to go 
<br>
attack any/all nations we feel like are &quot;evil&quot; and install a 
<br>
government by force more to our liking.  That is the 
<br>
international initiation of force and using such force to 
<br>
rearrange the world and its governments to our liking, even 
<br>
giving ourselves permission to do so preemptively is 
<br>
international agression and is uniformly condemned by us when 
<br>
other do it.
<br>
<p>But whether you agree with my thinking there or not does not 
<br>
make or action in Iraq per se a better or worse proposition.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Those who wish to convince me that we should not attak Iraq (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frankly I'm leaning toward that conclusion) must be able to tell me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly how Iraq differs from Afghanistan, and why those specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences justify the latter but not the former.  The opinion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peaceniks who would not have invaded Afghanistan either have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely zero weight with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe either one was or is justified.  Calling me a 
<br>
&quot;peacenik&quot; adds nothing meaningful to the conversation.   I am 
<br>
not interested in a foolish argument evaluation technique of 
<br>
only valuing an argument if it is not presented by someone you 
<br>
disagreed strongly with on some other matter.
