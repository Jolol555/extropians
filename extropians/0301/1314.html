Randall Randall stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Welcome to America.  Seriously, almost everyone here (in meatspace,
<br>
not on this list, I assume) believes that the US is graciously
<br>
allowing several European countries to use US troops to avoid
<br>
having to spend money on an army, and further that those countries
<br>
then invest that money in dumping product on the US market to
<br>
drive American workers out of their jobs.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, I would be hard-put to opine that Europeans are pushing Americans out 
<br>
of work, since their own economies have seemed quite lack-luster, in many 
<br>
ways. I stand by my question that if we are such a burden for them, let the 
<br>
wounded parties withdraw from nato; and let us resolve to remove US troops 
<br>
from their sacred soil. This sensibly would result as a reduction in tensions 
<br>
between the US and Europe, mayhaps?
<br>
<p>If the europeans remain hostile, but insist that American troops remain, then 
<br>
I would conclude some other process is going on. I am no big fan of 
<br>
isolationism, far from it, but the situation would echo Frances' hostility to 
<br>
North Africans, yet court Arab states for their supposed riches. As in the 
<br>
French case, hypocrisy will only get us so far. :-)
