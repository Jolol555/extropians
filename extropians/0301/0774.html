<em>&gt; Spandrelized?  Is that one of those scanner errors?  {8^D
</em><br>
<p>Check out S. J. Gould, who coined it (and in my comment I extended it as a
<br>
general metaphor, as others have done). Hell, let's just google:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Thinking.Psychologically96/0105">http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Hypermail/Thinking.Psychologically96/0105</a>

<br>
<p><p>The concept of an evolutionary &quot;spandrel&quot; has come about from an
<br>
architectural term relating to a necessary by-product of creating
<br>
something else. The exact analogy quoted by Pinker and Bloom (1990)
<br>
relates to Gould and Lewontin&quot;s (1979) reference to the arches and
<br>
spandrels in the dome of the San Marco basilica in Venice; &quot;Spandrels -
<br>
the tapering triangular spaces formed by the intersection of two rounded
<br>
arches at right angles ... are necessary architectural by-products of
<br>
mounting a dome on rounded arches.&quot; This feature has been elaborately
<br>
decorated with mosaics. An easy mistake would be to assume that the
<br>
triangular spaces had been put there intentionally as part of the
<br>
detailed decoration. In fact, they were there because of something
<br>
else. This argument is used by Gould and Lewontin to explain some
<br>
aspects of evolution which they do not feel can be accounted for by
<br>
natural selection. Epiphenomenal spandrels are seen as those which exist
<br>
but are of no real interest, such as the redness of blood, the V-shaped
<br>
space between a pair of fingers or the fact that there are a
<br>
prime-number of digits on each limb. Such spandrels have no direct
<br>
relevance to any behaviour or function and give no clues as to whether
<br>
the structures that they are associated with were shaped through natural
<br>
selection.
<br>
<p><p>The next rung up the ladder is to look at those spandrels which have
<br>
been modified and put to better use. This cannot be done alone and
<br>
requires the intervention of natural selection. It may be seen as the
<br>
process responsible for the modified design of an already existing part
<br>
in order to put it to more effective use.. This is where nature makes
<br>
the best possible use of what already exists to suit its own needs and
<br>
purposes; remembering that it does not have an empty page on which to
<br>
begin its creativity.. These are usually a single, unique part or
<br>
repeated shapes or processes involving simple physical or geometric
<br>
laws, such as hexagonal honeycombs and spiral markings. These are
<br>
modified and arranged alongside other more complex processes in order to
<br>
perform a function. Ultimately, they can only be explained by natural
<br>
selection.
<br>
<p><p>The nonselectionist aspect of evolution concerns unmodified spandrels.
<br>
This is used to describe a structure that already has a useful purpose
<br>
but that original function is usurped by another. Gould (1987a) (as
<br>
cited by Pinker &amp; Bloom (1990)) talks about a wading bird that uses its
<br>
wings primarily as a sun visor when looking for fish in the water. It
<br>
is difficult to argue successfully that something with such a complex
<br>
engineering design as the wing would have evolved through natural
<br>
selection for the primary purpose of blocking out the sun. A simpler
<br>
structure would have done the job just as well.
<br>
<p><p>This explanation of spandrels attempts to clarify what is being
<br>
discussed in terms of nonselectionism. It is also important when
<br>
looking at evolution to be aware of two other possibilities which exist
<br>
outside of selectionism. [tc]
