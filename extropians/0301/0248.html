-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Jeff Davis [mailto:<a href="mailto:jrd1415@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20Noam%20Chomsky%20(was%20RE:%20join%20The%20American%20Peace%20Movement)">jrd1415@yahoo.com</a>]

<p>I think capitalism is a good thing.  Gently regulated
<br>
to prevent it from biting the many small, trusting
<br>
hands that feed it.  I think freedom is a good thing,
<br>
too.  I like the idea and the practice of political
<br>
freedom and the consent of the governed.  The idea of
<br>
voting as a means of confirming that consent seems to
<br>
me feasible and equitable.  I think it entirely
<br>
reasonable to allow the commies to stand for election
<br>
amidst the throng of competing political creatures. 
<br>
And if they should win the vote, I think the governed
<br>
are entitled to enjoy/suffer the consequences of their
<br>
choice freely made.  
<br>
<p>Less than that isn't freedom.  At best it's
<br>
paternalism, at worst conventional subjugation.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------
<br>
<p>First of all, Jeff, I am surprised at your notions of freedom.  Especially
<br>
being an extropian.  Voting is NOT freedom, especially when the majority can
<br>
take away the rights of a minority by 'freely voting'  Would you consider it
<br>
'freedom' for an ethnic minority in the US to have their rights 'voted' away
<br>
by the majority?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From - <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/medialink/meaningoftherighttovote.shtml">http://www.aynrand.org/medialink/meaningoftherighttovote.shtml</a>
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Contrary to popular rhetoric, America was founded, not as a &quot;democracy,&quot;
<br>
but as a constitutional republic-a political structure under which the
<br>
government is bound by a written constitution to the task of protecting
<br>
individual rights. &quot;Democracy&quot; does not mean a system that holds public
<br>
elections for government officials; it means a system in which a majority
<br>
vote rules everything and everyone, and in which the individual thus has no
<br>
rights. In a democracy, observed James Madison in The Federalist Papers,
<br>
&quot;there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or
<br>
an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been
<br>
spectacles of turbulence and contention [and] have ever been found
<br>
incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.&quot;
<br>
<p>Secondly, I have still not heard what you moral condition for a government
<br>
is.  Anything less than a democratic constitutional republic has no moral
<br>
claim to existence, 'vote' or not.  As clearly indicated from the previous
<br>
discussions, the people of the south did not consider themselves a part of
<br>
the north, and as such their political future could not be 'voted' on by the
<br>
north.  
<br>
<p>Any people wishing a free democratic rule have a moral right to pursue
<br>
independence against oppressor 'parent' states, and any attempt to prevent
<br>
such an action is immoral.  
<br>
<p>That being said, Id like to try to understand how you consider the North
<br>
Vietnamese government under Ho a morally sound one.
<br>
