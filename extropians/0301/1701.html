</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eight leaders of European countries call for unity between Europe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America in dealing with Iraq, in a full-page editorial in today's London
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The countries are Spain, Portugal, Italy, Britain, Czech Republic, Hungary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Poland and Denmark.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I heard about this on a right-wing talk show this morning.
<br>
I also heard that Jordan and Turkey are supporting the U.S.
<br>
moves against Iraq, and that a poll showed that 77% of Americans
<br>
listening to Bush's speech agreed with his stand on Iraq.
<br>
<p>But you can listen to radio all day long, tuning in to ABC News,
<br>
CBS News, or NBC news, and you'll hear none of this.  On Bush's
<br>
speech, they repeated many times that &quot;hardly anyone's views
<br>
were changed&quot;, giving the impression that it was not resonating
<br>
with the majority of listeners.  You can also subscribe to the
<br>
on-line addition of the New York Times, as I have, and never
<br>
hear such news.  Here are the NYT's headlines for today:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Set to Push for a U.N. Debate on War With Iraq  --  The U.S. put
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a reluctant Security Council on notice that the time for disarming
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq peacefully was coming to an end.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bush Officials Debate Release of Iraq Secrets -- The potential intelligence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;material at issue ranges from satellite photographs of suspected Iraqi
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons sites to telephone intercepts.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Links Indonesian Troops to Deaths of 2 Americans -- Bush
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;administration officials have determined that Indonesian soldiers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;carried out a deadly ambush that killed two Americans last August.
<br>
<p>There are only two places where I may on a daily basis encounter
<br>
pro-American information at all:  one is the aforementioned right-
<br>
wing talk shows, and the second is the Extropian list.
<br>
<p>This pattern has been in evidence quite strongly the last six
<br>
months or so.  Our news media sounds exactly if it were under
<br>
the total control of senate liberal Democrats.
<br>
<p>Unbelievable.
<br>
<p>I'm re-quoting the editorial Mike appended to his post,
<br>
in case anyone missed it.  These days it is inconceivable
<br>
that the New York Times or the Washington Post would
<br>
print such a thing.  Look at those signatures!  Exactly
<br>
why won't you ever hear about this in the American media?

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-559907,00.html">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-559907,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THE real bond between the United States and Europe is the values we share:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy, individual freedom, human rights and the Rule of Law. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values crossed the Atlantic with those who sailed from Europe to help create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the USA. Today they are under greater threat than ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The attacks of 11 September showed just how far terrorists ‹ the enemies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our common values ‹ are prepared to go to destroy them. Those outrages were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an attack on all of us. In standing firm in defence of these principles, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments and people of the United States and Europe have amply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated the strength of their convictions. Today more than ever, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transatlantic bond is a guarantee of our freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We in Europe have a relationship with the United States which has stood the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test of time. Thanks in large part to American bravery, generosity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far-sightedness, Europe was set free from the two forms of tyranny that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devastated our continent in the 20th century: Nazism and Communism. Thanks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too, to the continued cooperation between Europe and the United States we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have managed to guarantee peace and freedom on our continent. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the current Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime¹s persistent attempts to threaten world security.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In today¹s world, more than ever before, it is vital that we preserve that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unity and cohesion. We know that success in the day-to-day battle against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction demands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unwavering determination and firm international cohesion on the part of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries for whom freedom is precious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat to world security. This danger has been explicitly recognised by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United Nations. All of us are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which was adopted unanimously. We Europeans have since reiterated our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backing for Resolution 1441, our wish to pursue the UN route and our support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the Security Council, at the Prague Nato Summit and the Copenhagen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; European Council.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message that we would rid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein¹s weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction. We must remain united in insisting that his regime is disarmed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies in unity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism is a threat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incalculable consequences. It is one at which all of us should feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerned. Resolution 1441 is Saddam Hussein¹s last chance to disarm using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peaceful means. The opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him. Sadly this week the UN weapons inspectors have confirmed that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-established pattern of deception, denial and non-compliance with UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security Council resolutions is continuing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, they are the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victims of Iraq¹s current brutal regime. Our goal is to safeguard world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peace and security by ensuring that this regime gives up its weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction. Our governments have a common responsibility to face this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent to our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens and to the wider world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United Nations Charter charges the Security Council with the task of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving international peace and security. To do so, the Security Council
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must maintain its credibility by ensuring full compliance with its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolutions. We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Resolutions. If they are not complied with, the Security Council will lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are confident that the Security Council will face up to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibilities.
