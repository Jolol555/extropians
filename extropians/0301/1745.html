<p>&lt;&lt;The &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; has been promoted for years by environmental
<br>
activists and alternative-energy gurus like Amory Lovins. But hydrogen is
<br>
not a source of energy, something which hydrogen advocates either don't
<br>
understand or refuse to acknowledge. Since hydrogen does not exist in
<br>
geological reservoirs it must be extracted from fossil-fuel feedstocks or
<br>
water. The process of extracting hydrogen uses energy, which means that
<br>
using hydrogen is less efficient that burning fossil fuels. And if you're
<br>
worried about global warming you certainly don't want to go that route. As a
<br>
recent energy-technology review in Science magazine pointed out last
<br>
November, &quot;Per unit of heat generated, more CO2 is produced by making H2
<br>
[hydrogen] from fossil fuel than by burning the fossil fuel directly.&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Personally I was hoping that by saying we will be switching to a 'hydrogen
<br>
economy' to rely less on imported Oil and to reduce harmfull emission Bush
<br>
was very cleverly talking actually about switching a Nuclear based
<br>
electrical infrastructure.  As this article points out, most people don't
<br>
know or care where you get the hydrogen from any more than they cared where
<br>
electric cars got the juice to charge their batteries.  Nuclear is the only
<br>
way to do it cheap, effeciently, and without producing green house gases.
