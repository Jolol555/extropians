<em>&gt; &gt; Rational people realize that /all/ speech is biased, and all speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be judged against the credibility of the speaker.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) And what do you think will the other 96+% do?
</em><br>
<p>Most people buy into the pretense of &quot;objectivity&quot; that major media
<br>
claim to have, and rely on authorities to tell them who's objective
<br>
and who isn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) Since when is &quot;credibility&quot; a rationally measurable unit?
</em><br>
<p>Since when is it not?  Do you deny the simple fact that some people
<br>
are more honest than others?  One doesn't need an SI unit to
<br>
recognize that.  Human judgment is quite sufficient, and far
<br>
superior to the alternative of not using judgment at all.  It is a
<br>
shame that not only do people fail to ue their judgment, but they
<br>
don't work to develop the skill.  The justice system, for example,
<br>
would work much better if jury members had more training and
<br>
practice at judging credibility, which is, after all, their primary
<br>
function.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine the following scenario: A (probably religious) group with good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections to government and or media starts a campaign against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism. Extropians are no good patriots, they deny god, plan to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overthrow the government, have no ethics, follow nazi eugenics, will kill 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children for their own longevity, etc.pp. Oh, and they're responsible for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the anthrax attacks. That surely was an extropic experiment to kill the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inferior... If someone could spread this propaganda with enough force, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including names and addresses, you'll probably feel, how many &quot;rational&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons really live around you - and how &quot;rational&quot; the authorities are.
</em><br>
<p>People /do/ spread those kinds of lies, and worse, every day.  And the
<br>
remedy for bad speech is /more/ speech, not supression by force.  The
<br>
day I recommend using the force of law against speech of any kind is
<br>
the day I will have surrendered my right to call myself a free man, or
<br>
to live in civilized society.  It is the very definition of civilization.
<br>
If those believers go beyond the point of speech and actually take
<br>
forcible /actions/ against my freedom, such as passing laws against
<br>
cloning or some other technology, /then/, and only then, am I justified
<br>
in using force to defend myself against their first use of force.  But
<br>
if all they do is speak, all I can do is speak in return, and hope that
<br>
humans with reasonable minds judge us both reasonably.
<br>
<p>Your contention that any kind of speech must be supressed is typical of
<br>
left-wing hopeless pessimism that humans are weak and ignorant and can't
<br>
possibly judge ideas for themselves, so they must have the &quot;right&quot; ideas
<br>
forced upon them, and be &quot;protected&quot; from dangerous ones.  I for one
<br>
have a bit more respect for human minds than that.
