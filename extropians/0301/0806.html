<p><em>&gt; &gt; the whole point of Sowell's &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've had to consult lately, is that deciding the *level* at which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different decisions occur is crucial to society's well-being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a good general point Lee (hence my forking the thread).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why not leave all these decisions to the people most closely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; affected?  They have the knowledge of their particular situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aspirations!  Is it because we feel that they may make a mistake?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who actually has the power now ... to *actually*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide who gets to make these decisions in society? 
</em><br>
<p>That's a deep question.  My suggested answer is that we all
<br>
decide, both individually and collectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you think that legislators decide - note that tend to vote 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bills into laws in bunches not simply on their lonesome ?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that citizens in democracies decide and if so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how?  Merely through voting or are other avenues open?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, and yes.  The legislators have the most
<br>
immediate and direct influence, but the voters
<br>
elect the legislators.  Yet the voters are affected
<br>
by memes, including yours and mine.  So we all 
<br>
participate in deciding at what level decisions
<br>
should be made.
<br>
<p>Constitutions exist to record and embody principles
<br>
known to be wise, and for the most part these principles
<br>
provide that many decisions be left up to smaller
<br>
bodies at lower levels.  The ultimate freedoms, speech,
<br>
right to bear arms, right to trial by jury, and so on,
<br>
are in these instruments reserved for those at the lowest
<br>
levels, the individuals.
<br>
<p>So in this way, the hands of the legislators are presumably
<br>
tied.  So, in summary, we would have to add to your list
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legislators and representatives
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voters and electors
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* ideas and memes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;* constitutional guarantees
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you think that political activists or the media or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media owners decide?
</em><br>
<p>For the most part, these decide just as individuals do,
<br>
and are subject to the same influences.  To be sure,
<br>
cults within the media have undue influence, but in
<br>
free countries there are alternative sources of news
<br>
and commentary.
<br>
<p>Lee
