</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This is a given and isn't my point. Which is to site examples of lives that 
<br>
have great suffering that are still worth living.

<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Even If a clone was born profoundly disabled, I couldn't say it was

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did I get that right? Are you proposing that we produce defective children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by an undebugged process on purpose?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. I am proposing that we make every effort to produce clones free 
<br>
from any defects and that we also except the Fact and simple truth that 
<br>
defects can and will occur despite our best efforts. Not only that, but more 
<br>
importantly. The clones that are not perfect or far from it are still worthy 
<br>
of life. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;        I can only see cloning as a good thing. It is inevitable that there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be clones born with abnormalities. Doing it the good ole fashion way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it is not inevitable. All you need is to figure out how to reset the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genome, and everything is dandy (provided no other difficulties appear).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I would tend to agree with your second point to overcome defects that are due 
<br>
to the process itself or predisposed genetic defects that can be corrected at 
<br>
the time of cloning. However I think it is inevitable that clones will be 
<br>
born with abnormalities. We cannot foresee every possible detail that may 
<br>
cause a clone to have defects. These details do not only include our mastery 
<br>
of the Human Genome. Other factors such as the health of the mother, 
<br>
Physical, Chemical or biological trauma to the unborn clone and countless 
<br>
other things could result in a clone with defects. Nature has been splicing 
<br>
our genes for millions of years and even when offspring are genetically fine, 
<br>
there can still be other problems. That is why it is inevitable that some 
<br>
clones will be born with defects. Substitute 'defect' for illness/pathology, 
<br>
etc. if that helps. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; isn't exactly the safest thing in the world. These cases of abnormality due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about some actual numbers, comparing the defect rate in normal birth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate and cloning instead of engaging in boolean argumentation? The world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not black and white, so let's not treat it that way when argumenting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I think the dataset on the side of the clones is a little too small for a 
<br>
valid argument. I would say without hesitation that if had the choice of 
<br>
being born through natural methods or cloning at present. I'd opt for the 
<br>
natural method. The current defect rate in cloning would seem to be 
<br>
incredibly high. This still doesn't remove the natural problems of 
<br>
reproduction from the argument. It just helps highlight my previous point 
<br>
that defects can and will occur even if the actual cloning procedure is 
<br>
perfect. My statement says that the world is not black or white and that the 
<br>
possible outcomes of natural reproduction and cloning are very grey. Neither 
<br>
is perfect and the outcome of cloning is still reliant on the natural process 
<br>
of gestation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; to the cloning process will rapidly decrease as our knowledge grows and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; honestly cant see any clone coming to term with such an ailment that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; render their life not worth living.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree vehemently. If you did that to me on purpose for no good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason at all (cloning doesn't result in any enhancement) I'd sue you, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite follow you. 
<br>
Are you saying that me being either the cloning doctor or parent. If you were 
<br>
the clone and you were born with a defect that caused your life to be of such 
<br>
a low standard that you felt it wasn't worth living. Then you would sue me or 
<br>
worse? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so then I will try to clarify what I said. I personally believe 
<br>
that where we draw the line demarking what is and isn't worth living depends 
<br>
entirely on your personal beliefs. If I had an accident that paralysed me and 
<br>
left me on a ventilator, entirely dependent on others for survival. My life 
<br>
would still be worth living. Likewise if I were born  with a similar 
<br>
condition my life in my view would still be worth living. Arguments of 
<br>
Identity aside, there would still be a conscious chain of though that would 
<br>
exist. There would also be a Hope of improvement. If I had never existed, 
<br>
there would never be a conciseness or any hope of improvement. So as you can 
<br>
see, I set the line pretty damn low, I imagine that you may not. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, a clone would have no more right to Sue than any person 
<br>
living today that has been born with deformities or ailments. If it was shown 
<br>
that these were caused by or were knowingly not prevented by the doctors. 
<br>
Then of course a clone would have a right to sue, just as anyone has the 
<br>
right today.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;        Most of the arguments I have heard against cloning are about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; irrational fears of what we will do with these clones. Great unstoppable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; armies, better make them immune from every pathogen on the planet! Slave 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labour, please! Hideously deformed mutants,!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strawman.
</em><br>
<p>Please elaborate. Strawman is not something I am familiar with. If its a gibe 
<br>
at my response to the comedic scaremongouring that some idiots have raised 
<br>
against cloning. Then Yes I know I shouldn't lower the level of the thread to 
<br>
include such inane arguments.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        Why don't we just replace the word Clone with Twin in every doom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sayer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paper on the subject and reread them? I know a few Twins and funnily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why don't we replace the world clone with 'identical twin with defects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced artificially', and reread them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why would there be artificially produced defects? If you mean, defects 
<br>
resultant from the process then that is one thing. Defects that are produced 
<br>
artificially would point to something different and more sinister. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion to replace clone with Twin was purely as a response to 
<br>
the ridiculous arguments or fears such as Armies of clones. It was mearly 
<br>
meant to remove the unknown irrational fear element that the word Clone 
<br>
connotes and replace it with something of virtually equal meaning that 
<br>
laypeople are familiar with. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; they have never tried to take over the world, have never been used for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific experimentation, have the same civil rights as the rest of us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as far as hideously deformed mutants. well they may not be the pretiest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people, but I think that is a bit harsh.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you doing this on purpose, or can't you really tell the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between a defective clone produced by a current procedure and an identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twin?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Doing what on purpose? When I say Twin I am of course referring to a 
<br>
genetically identical twin resultant of a division of the ovum into two 
<br>
genetically identical people. This Twin is greatly different in creation to 
<br>
the cloning of a living person. however the result is the same. Two 
<br>
genetically identical people. The clone is for argument sake, just a twin of 
<br>
a living person that was created and born at a later time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't go as far as to say that a clone of a twin is a triplet, 
<br>
but I may say that it is a twin of a twin. Could this not be considered 
<br>
correct? The point being that a Clone and a twin only differ in the method of 
<br>
creation. The result is the same. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only exception to this I can see is where mitochondria are brought 
<br>
into the equation. It could be that a Clone could have different 
<br>
Mitochondrial DNA to the person that was the original. Even in this case, the 
<br>
essence of what makes the clone identical to the original e. g the genes, 
<br>
will be identical as in a twin.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why would the clone be defective? What have civil rights of 
<br>
clones and twins and irrational fears of cloning got to do with the 
<br>
possibility of a clone having defects? The point was that a clone should and 
<br>
would have every civil right that a person of natural reproductive creation 
<br>
would have. As is the case with IVF.
