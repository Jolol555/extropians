<p>Yeah its not a great mystery it swings on what different
<br>
people mean by racism and in some cases on supersensitivy
<br>
and political correctness towards legitimate questions that
<br>
may be asked about race. 
<br>
<p>A recent issue of science magazine, I'll find the source if 
<br>
anyone wants it, gave a bit of a background into the recent 
<br>
history of how race is studied, or perhaps more accurately 
<br>
how researchers have had to deal with the vexed political 
<br>
aspects of even trying to first meaningfully define what 
<br>
constitutes a race and then go and study it. For a while useful
<br>
research into populations differences was very difficult to do 
<br>
because of the paranoia over feeding racist notions with facts. 
<br>
<p>One does not have to be a sexist to recognize there are 
<br>
differences between men and women, and to be open to the 
<br>
possibility that there might even be some differences in how 
<br>
male and female brains are arranged at some level. Or that 
<br>
nature may have set up the immune systems differently.  
<br>
<p>Similarly one does not have to be trying to produce a 
<br>
hierarchy of races to be interested in the extent to which
<br>
what is commonly understood as race by the &quot;man on the 
<br>
street&quot;, is actually real.
<br>
<p>IE. Racial purity is in most contexts a nonsense. But if 
<br>
everyone from Africa is black and everyone from Sweden 
<br>
is white (obvious differences - of no importance to me), then
<br>
perhaps there are differences in populations that are of interest.
<br>
Eg. Why do some &quot;races&quot; seem to be more susceptible to sickle
<br>
cell anaemia? Or why do some &quot;races&quot; seem to do better in 
<br>
Olympic swimming whilst others do better in the sprint.
<br>
<p>Racial groups are inherently interesting because of the slight 
<br>
physiological differences and varieties and possible useful gene
<br>
sets. 
<br>
<p>Not everyone who wishes to study race is looking to do so for
<br>
a nasty or insidious purpose, some scientists are just curious,
<br>
others want to understand differences in order to improve on
<br>
natures random scheme.
<br>
<p>Problem is that its hard to even study race without being 
<br>
called a racist. In my view that's throwing the baby out with
<br>
the bath water. 
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
