<em>&gt; Actually I find the hording of information by the super powers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thier middle and upperclasses a hundred times more selfish than one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person stealing copies of books. It ensures thier dominance over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other countries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other people. Isn't that the definition of a selfish act, to put 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself before others. Of course it's not practical to get everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same page but it couldn't hurt to make the information accessable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some form or another.
</em><br>
<p>Just what sort of 'hoarding' are you speaking of? 
<br>
<p>Putting yourself before others is simply human nature. If you seek to
<br>
put me in chains, I will surely put my interest in living free before
<br>
your interest in enslaving me, to the point of violence.
<br>
<p>Stealing the hard work of another is slavery, pure and simple. It
<br>
doesn't matter if you only want to enslave that person by a small
<br>
fraction of their output.
<br>
<p>Information is accessible to all. That is what libraries are for. What
<br>
you want isn't free access, it is to steal whole books, to HOARD books,
<br>
hidden away from the access of others, for your own personal use
<br>
without paying for the privilege.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What possible disadvantages could there be by allowing non-fiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books to be free on the internet. What, you have to have a commitee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to determine what is non-fiction. If people want to make money they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't be trying to reflect objective Truth in a scientific way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like you say we are trying to do.  Trying to make money will create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more non-scientific text because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will write to sell, not write the truth.
</em><br>
<p>By what rational logic or other moral/ethical argument can you say that
<br>
fiction should be protected but non-fiction should be free?
<br>
The non-fictional work of an author is still work, and they deserve to
<br>
be paid for their work in proportion to it's popularity.
<br>
<p>Science texts have always gotten MORE accurate, and have also always
<br>
been far more profitable, and expensive, than fiction or other lighter
<br>
reading books. For example, Isaac Asimov earned far more money from his
<br>
science books than from his science fiction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At a certain piont extropians have to worship a religion called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causation. They have to believe thier is nothing random and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undeterminable. They must believe that what they think pertains in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some way to reality. If they do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than what's the piont of any of this? Why not worship any religion?
</em><br>
<p>What is reality is that if writers cannot get paid for their work, most
<br>
will not write. Most artists will not create, not nearly to the degree
<br>
they do, if they cannot earn something for their work. Those that
<br>
continue to do so will never reach the same number of consumers without
<br>
the legal and justifiable profit-seeking investment of publishers,
<br>
galleries, music distributors, etc. Those that ignore this reality are
<br>
the same sort of fools that thought that socialism and communism were
<br>
valid economic systems.
