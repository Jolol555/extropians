Betterhumans - Engineered Growth Factor Speeds Wound Healing, Prevents
<br>
Amputations
<br>
==================================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-21-7">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-21-7</a>
<br>
<p>Delivering a genetic payload that spurs the generation of new blood
<br>
vessels, an engineered growth factor is proving safe and effective for
<br>
speeding healing in patients who face wound-related leg amputation.
<br>
Injected into leg muscles, the growth factor, NV1FGF, targets cells that
<br>
line blood vessel wells and directs them to grow new blood vessels,
<br>
improving circulation. The process is known as therapeutic angiogenesis.

New Scientist - Stem cells migrate from bone to brain

<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993286">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993286</a>
<br>
<p>Autopsies on four dead women have shown for the first time that stem
<br>
cells in bone marrow can develop into brain cells, not just blood and
<br>
bone cells as previously thought. The discovery suggests new approaches
<br>
for repairing damaged or diseased brains. Stem cells themselves could be
<br>
used, or the signalling chemicals that instruct them to become brain
<br>
cells, although these have yet to be identified...

Science Daily - Researchers Identify Protein That Kills Cancer Cells

<br>
<p>Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis
<br>
have found that a protein called cytidine uridine guanosine binding
<br>
protein-2 (CUGBP2) can destroy several different types of cancer cells.
<br>
When the team inserted the protein into cultured tumor cells, more than

70 percent self-destructed...

Betterhumans - Nanotech Dreams, Nanotech Nightmares: Group Aims to

<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-21-1">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-21-1</a>
<br>
<p>Offering the ability to create complicated machines
<br>
molecule-by-molecule, nanotechnology could allow for supercomputers
<br>
smaller than a grain of sand and tiny factories that help reduce poverty
<br>
around the world. But the technology could also allow weapons smaller
<br>
than a mosquito that can multiply rapidly, to horrific effect.
<br>
Navigating such nightmares to ensure the dreams of nanotechnology is the
<br>
goal of a new nonprofit organization.

BBC - Secrets of ageing revealed
<br>
================================
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2676735.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2676735.stm</a>
<br>
<p>Scientists have found a way to measure the tiny mechanism within the
<br>
body's cells which many believe may hold the key to the ageing process.
<br>
The researchers believe the technique will help efforts to pin down the
<br>
causes of disease such as cancer that become more common as we get
<br>
older. It is widely thought that the number of times a cell can divide -
<br>
and thus reinvigorate tissue - is controlled by the length of a
<br>
microscopic structure called a telomere.

CNN - Copied cat hardly resembles original

<br>
<p>Rainbow the cat is a typical calico with splotches of brown, tan and
<br>
gold on white. Cc, her clone, has a striped gray coat over white.
<br>
Rainbow is reserved. Cc is curious and playful. Rainbow is chunky. Cc is
<br>
sleek. Her birth December 22, 2001, was big news when it was announced
<br>
last February because it was the first time a household pet had been
<br>
cloned. Previous mammal clones were barnyard animals like cows and goats.

NY Times - 3-D RNA Folds and Molds Like a Key for a Specialized Work

====================================================================

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/21/science/21SHAP.html?ex=1043730000&amp;en=1756c1b6980263ec&amp;ei=5040&amp;partner=MOREOVER">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/21/science/21SHAP.html?ex=1043730000&amp;en=1756c1b6980263ec&amp;ei=5040&amp;partner=MOREOVER</a><br>
<p>It turns out that RNA can also fold into three-dimensional shapes that
<br>
can bind to something like a protein by shape, as a key fits in a lock.
<br>
That is important because proteins in a cell bind to one another by
<br>
shape, and drugs often work by fitting into their target by shape. For
<br>
instance, a popular area of biotechnology now is monoclonal antibodies,
<br>
which can be made to order to fit a particular shape of a target...

the question is now what we'll do with our genetic knowledge. In a year

<p>Craig Schaffner, 46, a Fayetteville-area computer consultant, has earned
<br>
the pity of friends and acquaintances for his tragic reluctance to
<br>
embrace the unverifiable, sources reported Monday. &quot;I honestly feel
<br>
sorry for the guy,&quot; said neighbor Michael Eddy, 54, a born-again
<br>
Christian. &quot;To live in this world not believing in a higher power,
<br>
doubting that Christ died for our sins—that's such a sad, cynical way to
<br>
live. I don't know how he gets through his day.&quot;

<p>NASA has requested a &quot;very significant&quot; increase in funding for the

development of nuclear propulsion systems for spacecraft, according to

Sean O'Keefe, the administration's chief. Existing chemical rocket

<p>It seems to be the week for excessive hype where space is concerned.
<br>
Over the last few days, three separate stories about developments and
<br>
problems in space exploration have made a considerable splash

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but on more detailed inspection, all three have been overblown.
