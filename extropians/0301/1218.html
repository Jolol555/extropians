<p>
I'll snip the posts from both Anders and Eliezer and simply
<br>
add the comment that it seems likely that if these two individuals are
<br>
debating the topic it goes to the core of an extropian perpsective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From where I sit, it is fundamental.  We may exist in an unlimited
</em><br>
universe (a Dysonian perspective) in which case we should understand
<br>
how to make the best use of that (i.e. how does one best prepare for
<br>
the &quot;slowdown&quot;).  *Or* we may exist in a &quot;limited&quot; universe in which
<br>
case we should understand how to best prepare for the inevitable
<br>
&quot;crunch&quot;.
<br>
<p>To prevent us from re-inventing this topic, I have started a web page:
<br>
<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/References/Universe.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/References/Universe.html</a>
<br>
<p>I will be happy to add references to this we page if people forward
<br>
them to me.  Let us not keep reinventing the wheel.
<br>
<p>It is worth noting that given my calculations based on current hazard
<br>
rates predicting an average longevity of several thousand years, or the
<br>
calculations of Robert Freitas from the recent Alcor conference
<br>
of a average longevity that might approach ten thousand years
<br>
(my sources suggest he may have said ~8,000 years but this was
<br>
based on some improvments in the current accident rate) -- that is
<br>
*still* a very very long way from the trillion or so years we can
<br>
expect to extract from any decent star with star-lifting.
<br>
<p>Bottom line: unless we come up with a very radical new paradigm for
<br>
how to evolve &quot;personally&quot; the &quot;extropic&quot; vision of self-preservation
<br>
of ones body is &quot;dead on arrival&quot;.  [Not that that is a &quot;bad&quot; thing
<br>
but I think it is something that should be discussed in greater detail
<br>
on the list.]  It seems to place an emphasis on the concept that
<br>
one must choose to either evolve or perish.  One can't (generally)
<br>
escape the laws of statistics.
<br>
<p>R.
