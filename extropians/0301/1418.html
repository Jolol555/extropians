<p>
I saw Jef Allbright raise the possibility of complementing the mailing
<br>
list with a wiki.
<br>
<p>I saw some folk ask about wikis and a few agree that it was a good
<br>
idea.
<br>
<p>I saw one person question whether it was the right tool for the job and
<br>
I thought that Jef answered well that good question by saying it would 
<br>
complement not substitute the existing ExI list.
<br>
<p>I saw Lee Daniel Crocker say he had some expertise and could set up
<br>
a wiki and he offered too if there was sufficient support for it. 
<br>
<p>I have heard a few people support it, no one directly oppose it, and so
<br>
what stands out in my mind are two questions.
<br>
<p>1) Are there any practical and logistical problems that the ExI Board or
<br>
any one else is aware of that would stop a wiki being implemented 
<br>
in a complementary fashion to the ExI list as Jef suggested?
<br>
<p>2) How much will it cost to set up and maintain? If  Lee Daniel
<br>
Crocker is willing to contribute some of his time and expertise that's
<br>
great. But I don't think he should have to bear all the burden for
<br>
something I'd certainly like to see and at least a few others seem
<br>
interested at least interested in as well.
<br>
<p>If someone (maybe Lee? who might know what's involved) could put
<br>
together a rough costed plan AND there are no substantial reasons for
<br>
opposing the proposal then my third question would become where
<br>
do I send money to help cover the costs?
