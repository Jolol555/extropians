<p><em>&gt; &gt; In 1900, Argentina was the 6th wealthiest country in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What happened?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a book that chronicles all the bad moves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; made by that nation?... Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... the state of Taxifornia in which you and I reside is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about to demonstrate some important universal truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about politics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We see here a regime that has been very generous with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people's money.  In the next few months we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to deal with a state debt of 34 billlllllion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars.  Taxamento has suggested three solutions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase income taxation of the rich, increase sales
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax and increase tobacco tax.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My notion is that in two of these cases, increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax rates will actually result in a reduction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital flow.  Increased income tax of the top income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bracket will cause capital to flee the state. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, already the top 1% pay a staggering proportion of
<br>
the tax total, and an article I read pointed out how
<br>
the direct punishment of this class can easily persuade
<br>
many of them to set up shop a couple of hours away in
<br>
Nevada.
<br>
<p>So then there is less revenue, and the downward spiral
<br>
begins.
<br>
<p>Not that there hadn't been warnings.  From more than a
<br>
year ago, January 8, 2002:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.pacificresearch.org/press/com/2002/kqed_02-01-08.html">http://www.pacificresearch.org/press/com/2002/kqed_02-01-08.html</a>
<br>
<p>Between 1998 and 2001, state government expenditures increased
<br>
by more than 35 percent and, the state added more than 25,000
<br>
new state employees. 
<br>
<p>The spending simply has been irresponsible.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.caltax.org/member/digest/Dec2002/12.2002.McCarthy-TaxpayerPerspective21BillionStateBudgetDeficit.06.htm">http://www.caltax.org/member/digest/Dec2002/12.2002.McCarthy-TaxpayerPerspective21BillionStateBudgetDeficit.06.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The following article seemed to me to have no discernable ideological
<br>
bias, and was helpful towards my understanding, including the 
<br>
possibility that the crises may even be exaggerated:
<br>
<p><a href="http://24hour.tri-cityherald.com/24hour/politics/story/712604p-5242257c.html">http://24hour.tri-cityherald.com/24hour/politics/story/712604p-5242257c.html</a>
<br>
<p>Spike continues
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Increases sales tax will stimulate internet sales,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from which tax cannot be collected.  Tobacco tax,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, the silly proles will still smoke I suppose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I expect tobacco revenue alone will not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offset the loss of revenue from the other two tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases, never mind the 34Gd deficit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you suppose will happen?
</em><br>
<p>California is still a big, strong, healthy animal.
<br>
These bleedings weaken it, of course, but probably
<br>
won't IMO kill it for a long time.
<br>
<p>The far worse aspect that seems impossible for most
<br>
people to realize is that economic growth is 
<br>
exponential.  Every time the big government enthusiasts
<br>
figure out a new way to &quot;benefit&quot; the people, they
<br>
take a state from one exponential curve to a lower one.
<br>
<p>It's practically impossible to imagine what happens
<br>
when you KEEP DOING THAT.
<br>
<p>Maybe the SF writers of the 30's and 40's weren't really
<br>
wrong:  perhaps there would be moon colonies and maybe
<br>
even flying cars had we kept to a different exponential.
<br>
