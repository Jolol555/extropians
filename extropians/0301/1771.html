Hubert Mania spoke:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Sad, sad, sad to read a disgusting self-righteous letter like this one from
<br>
John Grigg. Sounds like the essay of an eight year old brainwashed boy.
<br>
Shame on you, American cowboys! Shame on &quot;Pax Americana&quot;!
<br>
For the very very first time in the 48 years of my life I feel a faint pride
<br>
to be citizen of a nation that does not agree with US aggression all over
<br>
the globe, though it's representatives may surrender at last.
<br>
Hubert Mania, Germany&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Doing nothing, which is what you have suggested; is more dangerous, then any 
<br>
act of war; under the current situation. You seem to propose that states, 
<br>
which utilize guerilla groups (notice I didn't used the word terrorist?) and 
<br>
arm them with bio, or gas, or nukes; be left alone to accomplish this. Many 
<br>
scholars have noted that it is comparatively easy to do this and have the 
<br>
&quot;guerilla groups&quot; strike when ready. 
<br>
<p>This military philosophy was called &quot;plausible deniability&quot; by the CIA, 
<br>
during the 1950's and 60's. It is also a variation on what is termed 
<br>
&quot;low-intensity warfare&quot; by the think tanks of the 70's and 80's. In this 
<br>
epoch, the trick is to arm guerilla groups with nukes, plague, or nerve gas; 
<br>
and use it on cities; to deal psychological blow to its residents. It also 
<br>
has the multiplier effect of effecting economic behavior, as we have seen 
<br>
since 9-11; and thus contribute to destabilization.
<br>
<p>Saddam, may or may not have been the chieftain of Islamist Terror, by he is 
<br>
definitely a major player. As John Grigg noted in his post that you quoted 
<br>
from; the rest of the Islamic nations, including Saudi, may be chastened, by 
<br>
this US invasion of Iraq, and behave in a more decent manner (maybe). This 
<br>
could easily save much more lives then it takes, and more importantly to me, 
<br>
the lives taken will be Jihadi Muslims and not Americans.  
<br>
<p>Germany, was morally passive during the 2 Balkan Wars of the 1990's (yes I 
<br>
realize that because of history, there is great reluctance) but there is also 
<br>
more than a taste of self-centeredness that runs through European and German 
<br>
mindsets. &quot;Let the Ami's do it &quot; is the attitude, and &quot;we will blame them 
<br>
when the do!&quot; is the other side of the coin. You Germans have the expression 
<br>
&quot;clean your own damn front steps,&quot; which is the German way of saying 
<br>
&quot;butt-out.&quot; This was generally used by Germans, from what I recall, when 
<br>
dealing with the Hitler era.
<br>
<p>Well, here was the Balkans massacres happening on Europe's' front stoop, and 
<br>
you did what? Ignored it, until the Gott-Verdamned Ami's butted-in. Looking 
<br>
the other way when trouble comes does not place you in a position to feel 
<br>
morally (psychologically superior), but maybe that was not your intention, 
<br>
anyway, when you stated:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Shame on you, American cowboys! Shame on &quot;Pax Americana&quot;!&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not sure we are right, but I am confident that your policy seems wrong.
