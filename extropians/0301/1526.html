-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Samantha Atkins 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha responded:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Where precisely did you get this information?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which Mike Lorrey said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Where millions of other informed citizens get it: cable news, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newspapers, and the internet. Hans Blix stated these facts before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security Council (as did the US administration) after Iraq released its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Declaration to the UNSCOM.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Samantha, I can not seem to find a response on your part to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;As I said.  I am done arguing about this insanity.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fair enough.  I wanted to present the detailed information for others to see
<br>
as well, since it does not appear to be too widely known and the media
<br>
doesn't seem to interested in reporting it.  It just seemed from your
<br>
response that you were quite skeptical of that information, and may have not
<br>
come across it before.  I had also wondered if you considered it valid or
<br>
not, or if you knew of any reason to consider it invalid.  Since I believe
<br>
it to be of significant importance in weighing in on the WAR/NO WAR
<br>
question, I thought it would be prudent to provide it.  Please do not take
<br>
my continual comments to you as personal attacks.
