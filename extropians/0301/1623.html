<em>&gt; &gt; here have a very high bar: they have to prove that (1) the statements
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were false, (3) that they were presented as factual (i.e., not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parody or satire), (4) that actual harm was caused by them, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the case of &quot;public figures&quot;, (5) that there was actual malice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the speaker's intent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The drawback of this is that persons like Fred Leuchter can publicly deny 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Holocaust or even that people were killed in german KZ. IANAL, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO, this violates (1), (2), (3), causes significant emotional pain (4) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and intents to fuel hate and violence. German authorities may be a bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too nitpicking about symbols and literature from that time (bavarian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state attorneys even tried to put Art Spiegelmanns &quot;Maus&quot; on the black 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list). Perhaps a middle course would be best.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't surprize me that a German would think it's acceptable
<br>
for the government to step in to prevent that kind of speech.  I
<br>
guess the European attitude is that using force against your own
<br>
people's fundamental freedoms is OK, but using it to free other
<br>
people is unacceptable.
<br>
<p>Screw the &quot;middle course&quot;.  Even American law goes too far--there
<br>
is no reason to have libel and slander laws at all.  If person A
<br>
makes slanderous statements about person B, and person C takes some
<br>
action against B because of them, it is person C who has committed
<br>
the crime, not A.  Rational people realize that /all/ speech is
<br>
biased, and all speech should be judged against the credibility of
<br>
the speaker.
