<em>&gt;&gt;Eight leaders of European countries call for unity between Europe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;America in dealing with Iraq, in a full-page editorial in today's London
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The countries are Spain, Portugal, Italy, Britain, Czech Republic, Hungary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Poland and Denmark.

<em>&gt; Yes, I heard about this on a right-wing talk show this morning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also heard that Jordan and Turkey are supporting the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moves against Iraq, and that a poll showed that 77% of Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listening to Bush's speech agreed with his stand on Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you can listen to radio all day long, tuning in to ABC News,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CBS News, or NBC news, and you'll hear none of this.  On Bush's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech, they repeated many times that &quot;hardly anyone's views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were changed&quot;, giving the impression that it was not resonating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the majority of listeners.  You can also subscribe to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on-line addition of the New York Times, as I have, and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear such news.  Here are the NYT's headlines for today:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   INTERNATIONAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   U.S. Set to Push for a U.N. Debate on War With Iraq  --  The U.S. put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   a reluctant Security Council on notice that the time for disarming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Iraq peacefully was coming to an end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Bush Officials Debate Release of Iraq Secrets -- The potential intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   material at issue ranges from satellite photographs of suspected Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   weapons sites to telephone intercepts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   U.S. Links Indonesian Troops to Deaths of 2 Americans -- Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   administration officials have determined that Indonesian soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   carried out a deadly ambush that killed two Americans last August.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are only two places where I may on a daily basis encounter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pro-American information at all:  one is the aforementioned right-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wing talk shows, and the second is the Extropian list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This pattern has been in evidence quite strongly the last six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; months or so.  Our news media sounds exactly if it were under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total control of senate liberal Democrats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unbelievable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm re-quoting the editorial Mike appended to his post,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in case anyone missed it.  These days it is inconceivable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the New York Times or the Washington Post would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; print such a thing.  Look at those signatures!  Exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why won't you ever hear about this in the American media?

<em>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-559907,00.html">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-559907,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;THE real bond between the United States and Europe is the values we share:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;democracy, individual freedom, human rights and the Rule of Law. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;values crossed the Atlantic with those who sailed from Europe to help create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the USA. Today they are under greater threat than ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The attacks of 11 September showed just how far terrorists ‹ the enemies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;our common values ‹ are prepared to go to destroy them. Those outrages were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;an attack on all of us. In standing firm in defence of these principles, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;governments and people of the United States and Europe have amply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;demonstrated the strength of their convictions. Today more than ever, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;transatlantic bond is a guarantee of our freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;We in Europe have a relationship with the United States which has stood the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;test of time. Thanks in large part to American bravery, generosity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;far-sightedness, Europe was set free from the two forms of tyranny that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;devastated our continent in the 20th century: Nazism and Communism. Thanks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;too, to the continued cooperation between Europe and the United States we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have managed to guarantee peace and freedom on our continent. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the current Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;regime¹s persistent attempts to threaten world security.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In today¹s world, more than ever before, it is vital that we preserve that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;unity and cohesion. We know that success in the day-to-day battle against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction demands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;unwavering determination and firm international cohesion on the part of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;countries for whom freedom is precious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;threat to world security. This danger has been explicitly recognised by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;United Nations. All of us are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;which was adopted unanimously. We Europeans have since reiterated our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;backing for Resolution 1441, our wish to pursue the UN route and our support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for the Security Council, at the Prague Nato Summit and the Copenhagen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;European Council.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message that we would rid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein¹s weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;destruction. We must remain united in insisting that his regime is disarmed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies in unity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism is a threat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;incalculable consequences. It is one at which all of us should feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;concerned. Resolution 1441 is Saddam Hussein¹s last chance to disarm using
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;peaceful means. The opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;him. Sadly this week the UN weapons inspectors have confirmed that his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;long-established pattern of deception, denial and non-compliance with UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Security Council resolutions is continuing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Europe has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, they are the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;victims of Iraq¹s current brutal regime. Our goal is to safeguard world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;peace and security by ensuring that this regime gives up its weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;destruction. Our governments have a common responsibility to face this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent to our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;citizens and to the wider world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The United Nations Charter charges the Security Council with the task of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;preserving international peace and security. To do so, the Security Council
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;must maintain its credibility by ensuring full compliance with its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;resolutions. We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Resolutions. If they are not complied with, the Security Council will lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;We are confident that the Security Council will face up to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;responsibilities.
