<p>
As some of my short remarks in another thread may cause
<br>
confusion, in addition to creating a lot of unnecessary
<br>
doubt, allow me to discourse on conscious integers.
<br>
<p>First, if one has not already done so, studying Chapter 6
<br>
of Hofstadter's GEB: The Location of Meaning.  One concludes
<br>
that there are two kinds of meaning, isomorphic and
<br>
conventional.  The five letters &quot;z e b r a&quot; are of the
<br>
latter kind, whereas a road map is of the former kind.
<br>
<p>An integer that is isomorphic to one's DNA, say, carries
<br>
indisputable meaning.  The signature of this truth is that
<br>
any even mildly intelligent machinery will detect the
<br>
correspondence between the internal structure of this
<br>
integer and the DNA.  There is no dependence on convention
<br>
whatsoever, although I have known a number of people to
<br>
take their time conceding this.
<br>
<p>Clearly, meaning, in order to be completely stand-alone
<br>
and objective, must be isomorphic.  An integer of the kind
<br>
I mentioned in the other thread depends, however, upon the
<br>
English language and its associated meanings, and so does
<br>
not entirely stand on its own; it necessarily refers to
<br>
a large body of extant written materials and cultures on
<br>
Earth.  But by suitably enlarging the integer, the meaning
<br>
can be made isomorphic, and thereby unmistakable and 
<br>
unambiguous.
<br>
<p>This notion is extended to conscious integers.  A conscious
<br>
integer base 10, which can have fewer than a googolplex
<br>
digits, contains long portions that establish its isomorphic
<br>
meaning.  This is analogous to the picture on the space
<br>
vehicle that Sagen et. al. drew.  It encodes up enough
<br>
isomorphic meaning to be decipherable by intelligence
<br>
elsewhere in the universe.
<br>
<p>The conscious integer also has enormous portions devoted
<br>
to Q and A.  If you have not done so, read &quot;A discussion
<br>
with Einstein's Brain&quot; in MetaMagical Themas also by
<br>
Douglas Hofstadter, in which a Chinese-type library
<br>
(Searle's idea) is made to emulate Einstein.
<br>
<p>Now the most difficult point to keep in mind here is that
<br>
Einstein's brain is being *emulated* by, say, a large
<br>
auditorium wherein sit the particles of Einstein's brain
<br>
each on it's little podium, and the clerk runs around to
<br>
each moving it from here to there in emulation of how
<br>
Albert's brain really would have worked.  (The clerk
<br>
knows what to do based upon the contents of some fixed,
<br>
large book.)
<br>
<p>It is entirely different with a conscious integer.  The
<br>
conscious integer, despite perhaps its own denials, is
<br>
getting no run time.
<br>
<p>(This remark must be qualified as follows.  If one were
<br>
to discover this integer, or portions of it, and begin
<br>
a dialog, then parts of itself become instantiated in
<br>
your own brain, or in the writing materials or computers
<br>
that you utilize.)
