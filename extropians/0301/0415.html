<p>Kant's Categorical Imperative makes your conclusion even more obvious,
<br>
and without recourse to probabilistic arguments or predictions of the
<br>
particular child's subjective preferences. 
<br>
<p>The CI is &quot;act only on that maxim by which you can at the same time will
<br>
that it should become a universal law.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the CI, I reason as follows: &quot;The general welfare of humanity would
</em><br>
clearly be worsened if it were universally true that mothers severely
<br>
mutilated their children and if it were universally true that people
<br>
condoned such mutilations. Therefore I cannot condone such mutilations
<br>
and should attempt to prevent them.&quot;
<br>
<p>In general, the CI goes a long way toward answering the question whose
<br>
business is it. If people are doing X, and if you think the world be
<br>
better off if no one did X, then you have moral justification to argue
<br>
against X. You might still be wrong, of course, but your error would
<br>
then be one of logic rather than morality.
