<p>
<em>&gt;From Natasha:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; My .....concern with this list has been over the many years to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diffuse ........the wrongful claims made by some people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ExI is a political organization, which it is NOT and claims no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular affiliation with ANY one political mindset, platform 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or organization.
</em><br>
<p>One needs only to read the extropian principles to see that
<br>
extropianism (defined there as &quot;the evolving transhumanist
<br>
philosophy of extropy&quot;) aims to be inclusive of people rather
<br>
than exclusive of people.
<br>
<p>I think, therefore that I do understand what you mean when
<br>
you say ExI is not a political organisation. Whilst individual
<br>
extropians and transhumanists are doubtless very much 
<br>
interested in politics I certainly would not expect to see (nor
<br>
would I recommend) the forming of any political parties
<br>
running candidates in elections on platforms in the name of 
<br>
transhumanism or extropianism.
<br>
<p>But I would actually like further clarification on something
<br>
because a couple of points do come to mind.
<br>
<p>First, as a class of people, extropians are thoughtful and very
<br>
interested in what is going on in the world and they are willing
<br>
and able to perceive different possible futures for themselves
<br>
and for people generally and to make judgements on the ones
<br>
that are better or worst and to work towards making the 
<br>
better possible futures become realised rather than the worse
<br>
ones. Despite the obvious affection of some of us for 
<br>
philosophical debate and discussion we are not merely 
<br>
philosophers are we? Are we not also interested in actively
<br>
fostering particular types of change? Of seeing to ensure
<br>
that good policies rather than bad policies and laws are 
<br>
enacted? That some memes and not others are promoted? 
<br>
How can ExI be a meme-engine and not political?
<br>
<p>Second, it seems to me that politics is not something that one
<br>
can always choose to avoid. If a group has a name, the name
<br>
can be used to make a political target of the group or 
<br>
organisation, regardless of whether that group thinks of itself
<br>
as a political organisation or not. (This is analogous I think to
<br>
the old compete or cooperate fundamental choice. I may not
<br>
&nbsp;*want* to be competitive. But if someone chooses to compete
<br>
against me, they *can* remove the option of my cooperating
<br>
with them and effectively make me either compete or
<br>
unconditionally surrender. Effectively they can *make* me
<br>
compete). Is it not similarly the case that ExI, although it may
<br>
not see itself as a political organisation, and may not wish to 
<br>
be a political organisation, could be forced to act politically if
<br>
someone or some organisation treats it politically? Perhaps 
<br>
attacks it or misrepresents it?
<br>
<p>There are groups in the world that hold views along the lines
<br>
that (I'm setting up a caricature) &quot;There is no &quot;Truth&quot; but &quot;The
<br>
&nbsp;Truth&quot; and &quot;our Fred&quot; is The translator and The interpreter of 
<br>
The Truth&quot;.  These groups *do* have a political agenda. They
<br>
want to remove all dissenters, and all claimants to other truths
<br>
and ways of arriving at The Truth than through the revelation 
<br>
of Fred (or Fred's &quot;delegates&quot; - but don't expect to see any
<br>
signed authorisation from now dead Fred :-)).
<br>
<p>So where does ExI sit in the world of politics if it is not involved
<br>
in politics? Can it really be like a nature watcher in a game park?
<br>
Seems to me the meat eating predators can also take an 
<br>
epicurean interest in nature watchers too.
<br>
<p>Finally, if an organisation can be forced to respond politically,
<br>
might it not be good tactics to avail itself of political defences
<br>
that become available by admitting to being political. There is
<br>
in Australia at the moment a  particular Aboriginal politician in
<br>
a prominent position within the ATSIC (Aboriginal and Torres
<br>
Strait Islander Commission) charged with theft or fraud. He is
<br>
for the moment refusing to stand down from his position as
<br>
deputy head of the commission (whilst inquiries proceed) despite
<br>
much encouragement that he do so saying . (I'm paraphrasing) 
<br>
He says the charges have arisen purely as a result of his political
<br>
opponents trying to discredit him. And that he looks forward to
<br>
clearing his name in court. Meanwhile he wont give DNA to the
<br>
police because, he says, they won't tell him why they want it.
<br>
<p>Now here's my point. It seems that only a politician or political
<br>
organisation can credibly get away with a line like &quot;this has all
<br>
been cooked up by my political opponents. Its completely
<br>
groundless&quot;. Non political organisations are left blinking into the
<br>
media spotlight like stunned to-be-roadkill, usually, completely
<br>
at a loss as to what to say when surprised by a completely
<br>
unexpected political attack.Pretty safe bet they thought they
<br>
were not political either. Maybe, just maybe. It is better to be
<br>
overtly political and therefore have the ready media &quot;sound bite&quot;
<br>
defence of  &quot;this attack is politically based and groundless&quot; 
<br>
available.
<br>
<p>Where does ExI sit in a political world?
<br>
