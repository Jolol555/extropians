<em>&gt; people called the USA, compared to the rest of that continent. But that's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly the problem: The US are one among others. Seems hard for them to 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry Kai,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        When the US was a 3rd world country nobody much cared that we called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves America.  It was only when we became a 1st world country that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered we were unworthy. 
</em><br>
<p>*g* First world? Maybe by some technology and financial power, but 
<br>
neither by political standards, nor by credibility of its government. A 
<br>
president not elected by the majority of the voters, the voting system 
<br>
faultier than once in east Germany, power-shortages like in Sibiria, 
<br>
human rights non-existent if you unfortunately become suspect of certain 
<br>
crimes, big brother around the corner and in the sky, ... I'd rather 
<br>
say: A threshold country on its way back into the middle ages - only 
<br>
with TV.
<br>
<p>And a country with a regime that thinks it will get away with 
<br>
everything. What would you for example think if european secret agencies 
<br>
would openly eavesdrop almost every telephone call in your country, 
<br>
automatically read almost every e-mail and if a european president had 
<br>
officially given out the order, to promote any relevant information 
<br>
gained to european companies?[1]
<br>
<p>What would you think, if some of the most important software packages, 
<br>
say e.g. SAP, would be tampered, so that the german agencies could 
<br>
always read everything your companies do with that software?[2]
<br>
<p>What would you think, if a country as far away as Japan would threaten 
<br>
the US with war, because the US is not obeying some resolutions of the 
<br>
UN security council?[3]
<br>
<p>What would you think, if the same country would only attack you, with 
<br>
your resources, but not it's &quot;friend&quot; nation, which it lets get away 
<br>
with any breach of resolutions, even state terrorism against its 
<br>
neighbors[4]? What would you think, if this rogue state would start to 
<br>
lay fire onto your whole region, destroying your social and economical 
<br>
basis?[5]
<br>
<p>Wouldn't you think, that such a country uses double measure? Wouldn't 
<br>
you say the ethics of that government is -well- not very ethical? Hm? 
<br>
Can you understand, why half of the world would like such a government 
<br>
to get a real good kick in the face, so that it has to sit back and 
<br>
behave in a proper and decent way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But then the news is out that 80 of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies are trading with Sadaam so you accuse us to cover yourself.
</em><br>
<p>You obviously didn't read the original article in Tageszeitung. 
<br>
According to that paper, the list in the UN report contains the names of 
<br>
companies who delivered to Iraq since the 70s! No wonder that you'll 
<br>
find almost every company on this list. I have, btw, seen several trials 
<br>
against german companies here.
<br>
<p>I don't know wether any officials here silently support any illegal 
<br>
activities. AFAIK, there are no current news about this in our political 
<br>
press. But from my point of view, I don't embrace any proliferation of 
<br>
weapons, neither from here, nor from any other country. And I don't 
<br>
embrace deals with &quot;bad guys&quot;, neither by my country nor by any other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Anyway, it is good to hear from a friend of Sadaam and Osama, thanks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for writing.  At least we now know where your preferences lay -- with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalitarians and oppressors.
</em><br>
<p>That's simply bullshit, made up by yourself. And it shows the same 
<br>
mechanism of mistake like the above story. I could call it the Extropian 
<br>
List Strategy for Misleaded Reasoning, because most discussions here 
<br>
suffer from it. It starts by coming up with some unproven idea, for 
<br>
which then some simple facts need to be found. The pro facts will never 
<br>
need any proof. It's enough when they fit the opinion. The contra facts 
<br>
on the other hand are always forged, wrong and have to be proven better 
<br>
than &quot;2 H2 + O2 --&gt; 2 H20&quot;. In case someone mentions that this view is 
<br>
too simplistic, he'll get called a leftie, a luddite or both. A simple 
<br>
strategy from simple minds?
<br>
<p>Take this &quot;Iraq discussion&quot; for example. A brilliant example indeed for 
<br>
total ignorance of the context. Has anyone here thought about what the 
<br>
consequences will be? What the rest of the arab states will do, what the 
<br>
people there will do? This Rambo style of Mr. Bush will surely produce 
<br>
more fanatics, more terrorism, more war, more money burned instead of 
<br>
used productively, less predictable politics and less freedom for all of us.
<br>
<p>A military action by an &quot;outsider&quot;, a nation seen as &quot;imperialistic, 
<br>
evil and greedy&quot; (cf. iraq propaganda), would play thousands of new 
<br>
potential terrorists into the hands of every militia in that region, 
<br>
just because they don't know better. Another wave of terrorist attacks 
<br>
will be the logical consequence. Instead of one dictator, you'll get 
<br>
dozens of potential bin Laden's. I wouldn't call that a good deal.
<br>
<p>Take a look at these numbers:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq      |   USA
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.3 mio. |   287.6 mio. citizens
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;222        |  2118    radios / 1000 citizens
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;83        |   854    TV / 1000 citizens
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.1      |   664.5  telephones / 1000 citizens
<br>
no longer av. |   371.4  internet accesses / 1000 citizens
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9        |  1489    different daily newspapers with ...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500,000    |    56 mio. ... copies
<br>
<p>Plus an illiteracy in Iraq of 34% (men) and 54% (women). These people 
<br>
know even less about the world than the average american does. But they 
<br>
can't even get other informations. That's the way believers are made. 
<br>
And most other countries in that region are not any better. Just make it 
<br>
clear to yourself, that these people do not live in the same 
<br>
(information) world as you and I do. A war against Iraq will make every 
<br>
anti-US fanatic look right.
<br>
<p>We have seen this process at work. Shortly after he came to power, Mr. 
<br>
Bush said, that the middle east were not his concern, the USA would 
<br>
withdraw all personnel and cancel all diplomatic actions. Unfortunately, 
<br>
the problems of the middle east followed him home...
<br>
<p>Or take for example Afganistan. The Taliban are beaten, but not really 
<br>
gone. The whole country is now a power vacuum, that could easily become 
<br>
a shelter for terrorists again. Therefore, the international forces have 
<br>
to stay there and help to rebuild the country. Happy and well fed people 
<br>
don't become terrorists so easy, but desperate and mislead people do.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this process needs a lot of time, money, personnel and 
<br>
is, on the other hand, not as spectactular as laser controlled bombs or 
<br>
other ways of killing humans and destroying their belongings. It also 
<br>
needs careful longterm planning and tiresome talks with the persons on 
<br>
the other side (instead of simply shooting them...).
<br>
<p>Nothing of this has been seen from the USA. Instead, others are now 
<br>
there, dutch, british - and germans. What do you think will be the 
<br>
lesson learned by the people of Afganistan (remember their sources of 
<br>
information and their even greater illiteracy)? They'll say: The 
<br>
Americans bombed our houses and the Europeans helped us to rebuild them...
<br>
<p>Where are the plans for Iraq _after_ Saddam? Where is the alternative? 
<br>
Where is the coalition with the other countries in that region?
<br>
<p>That's exactly what I meant with &quot;one amongst others&quot;: Too short-sighted 
<br>
plans with too few variables and not enough understanding for the context.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai
<br>
<p>[1] The Echelon network of the US army records almost every long 
<br>
distance call and most of the internet activity in Europe. The 
<br>
presidents Bush sen., Clinton and Bush jun. have approved this and 
<br>
ordered the agencies to support US companies with these informations.
<br>
<p>[2] One half of the keys of Lotus Notes and several other software 
<br>
packages were given to the NSA by the software companies itself. Every 
<br>
message encoded with these keys can be read by the NSA. See above.
<br>
<p>[3] The US itself has broken international treaties (Kyoto, SALT2, ...).
<br>
<p>[4] While being overly strict when it come to Iraq, the US have never 
<br>
forced Israel to obey the UN resolutions. Iraq was attacked because it 
<br>
claimed Kuwait. The military action was therefore justified. But 
<br>
protecting Israels occupation of palestinian land is double measure.
<br>
<p>[5] A second war against Iraq without a credible reason - which has nit 
<br>
been given yet - can probably ignite the whole middle east, including 
<br>
Israel into a years long civil wars, religious uproars, immigration 
<br>
waves, etc. Since nothing has been done yet to contain these 
<br>
consequences, I consider the US gvnmt very shortsighted and very dangerous.
