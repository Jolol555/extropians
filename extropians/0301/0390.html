<p>Hi Samantha :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>How many would be wedded to the use of the word
<br>
&quot;belief&quot; in that sentence I wonder?R I.E. Would they be
<br>
willing to freely drop it and substitute it with another if
<br>
they were convinced the word belief carried too much
<br>
negative baggage?R
<br>
<p>Or would insist that this one (this life) cease before the
<br>
next once starts, rather than that this one would morph
<br>
with no loss of personal continuity in exchanging
<br>
substrates?R.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Others think it quite likely that we are in a sim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or are at least &quot;players&quot; in a sim.
</em><br>
<p>An interesting hypothesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point of bringing this up is that belief in a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond this one, even of the more conventionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious kind, is not automatically a sign of serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological problems and limitations.
</em><br>
<p>Serious psychological problems by the standard of these
<br>
times, no, I agree. Limitations, I'm not so sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even conventional religious folks often belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in and practice good stewardship of resources in this life.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, it is true that many who do believe in an &quot;afterlife&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and even some that believe in some types of techno-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcendence, consider things of &quot;this life&quot; of not enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance to spend much time maximizing.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, maximizing what?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Belief makes for bad social policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally I get a little tweaked by &quot;social policy&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You, tweaked? No. ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It smacks of collectivism and of centralized power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some supposed limit on individual rights to come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever conclusions or  beliefs by whatever methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they see fit.
</em><br>
<p>If you find it in that form, and you reckon you can do it
<br>
safely, smack it back ;-)
<br>
<p>When I talk of &quot;social policy&quot; in this context I mean it quite
<br>
simply as the way social groups (societies if you will) make
<br>
decisions as to how to allocate resources amongst
<br>
themselves, and what rights there should be that they will
<br>
each undertake to accepts some personal responsibility
<br>
for so that these rights are not just theoretical but are
<br>
actually underwritten in practice by the free decisions of
<br>
others in the social compact.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately when some of the social group bring belief
<br>
of the supernatural into their considerations they can start
<br>
to imagine that the nexus between rights granted and
<br>
responsibilities assumed can be broken. That somehow,
<br>
because the supernatural underwriter is going to step in
<br>
if necessary societies can grant rights without its members
<br>
needing to merely confine themselves to real resources
<br>
and the real capacity of the society to underwrite those
<br>
rights.
<br>
<p>Problem is when citizens try to rely on rights that are not
<br>
underwritten by real responsibilities they find those rights
<br>
cannot be relied on.
<br>
<p>I don't think any of the above comments are more or
<br>
less true regardless of whether you have centralised power
<br>
or government or not. The nexus between real rights
<br>
socially allocated and real responsibilities socially accepted
<br>
(without recourse to supernatural - unreliable underwriting)
<br>
is far more fundamental than any particular form of
<br>
government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I need to get to know someone before I give them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the benefit of  the doubt as to having done either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; qualitative or quantitative analysis of any sort *if*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they say they have arrived at a position based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faith or belief.  Actually if the used the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;arrived at a position&quot; I'd probably raise my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evaluation a bit. If they use another word instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of believe,  like perceive, think, suspect etc.. I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  there's a better chance of some sort of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processing going on. That they are not just parroting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what they've heard. I guess I apply a crude sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Turing test to people. I suspect that some others that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have a strong commitment to reason also make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assessments on  the basis of language. Assessments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which are not facts, but are definitely not mere beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should anyone care whether you approve of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word they use for their process or not though?
</em><br>
<p>Well I'm no one particularly special, so let's be clear about
<br>
that. But to answer your question, perhaps one intelligent
<br>
thoughtful person should care about what another intelligent
<br>
thoughtful person thinks because their is a genuine
<br>
opportunity to learn for both of them if one adopts that
<br>
attitude.
<br>
<p>As it happens I have spent quite a bit of time thinking about
<br>
the use of particular words in the context of political debates
<br>
and do have some real world lobbying experience at quite
<br>
a high level but I expect no way to take my insights or
<br>
experience on faith. Rather I see it as my responsibility to
<br>
make my case.
<br>
<p>I would counsel all who would listen not to accept things
<br>
I say because I say them, (I don't want disciplines -like
<br>
I'd come looking for them here : -) - I want more friends,
<br>
more colleagues, an extended community and more people
<br>
with whom I can work to make the world a better place as
<br>
determined by us not just by me). I ask that people accept
<br>
only what I say *after* consideration *if* it seems to be
<br>
true and/or useful to them (and then only accept it provisionally
<br>
until something better becomes available). But I'd also say
<br>
please be generous with *your* insights, thoughts and
<br>
criticisms with me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I disagree with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contention, as Lee did, that &quot;belief&quot; usually means or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be  taken to imply an unthinking acceptance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some one who does no better than to believe when reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is available in my view is morally copping out in many cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The process of  reasoning is available to normal homo sapiens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but it can't be engaged simultaneously with the process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believing. Belief starts when reasoning stops. If indeed in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; peoples cases, on many issues, reason every got out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; starting block in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The above assumes that reason alone is sufficient for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things.
</em><br>
<p>I did say when reason is available. Sometimes we must make
<br>
decisions. And so the process of reasoning is suspended on that
<br>
matter (at least for a time). But their is I think a difference in reason
<br>
deliberately and knowingly suspended, and reason abdicated when
<br>
the chance to reason remains and circumstances offer it as an option.
<br>
An option to accepting on faith or with belief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But some quite fundamental philosophical decisions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the Primacy of Matter vs. Primacy of Consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not decidable on the basis of reason alone.
</em><br>
<p>PCR makes clear, I think, that it *is* necessary to accept some
<br>
axioms as fundamental but it has the virtue of systematically looking
<br>
at what these are and of formally acknowledging the limits.
<br>
(To be completely honest I may be getting a little rusty on Pan
<br>
Critical Rationalism myself its been a while since I read about it).
<br>
<p>In relation to the Primacy of Matter vs. Primacy of Consciousness
<br>
I am not sure that I am well enough versed in this area to comment
<br>
intelligently, however my inclination would be to say that they are
<br>
not decidable on the basis of reason *yet*.  Perhaps I am
<br>
misunderstanding this particular point and you might enlighten me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly axiomatic level not further reducible.
</em><br>
<p>Nearly?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is also the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of a more inductive approach to certain questions of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and value.  For that matter, the entire sphere of values is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily reduced to that which reason alone recommends.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not easily. But as I hope has become a little more clear
<br>
through the course of this reply I am looking a reasoning and
<br>
believing very much in the context of what they mean for the social
<br>
compact.
<br>
<p>Also, perhaps some &quot;values&quot; in the &quot;entire sphere&quot; should not be
<br>
valued. Perhaps belief should not be valued. I don't value it. I value
<br>
people (even believers). I respect their right to have opinions and to
<br>
use words like belief. But I don't currently respect belief as such, I
<br>
think its anti-social at worst and a-social at best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I certainly won't willingly contribute to the view that belief is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good and as valid a way of making decisions in the world as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason. It isn't. Indeed promoting such a misconception in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; democracy increases the chances of my premature demise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you have employed reason and cannot reach a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but you have to choose, what do you do?
</em><br>
<p>I make a provisional assessment, or if need be a final assessment
<br>
as dictated by the need to reach a decision as best I can given the
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I expect you &quot;make a value judgment&quot; that at least seems unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to be certainly wrong and seems to be mostly in the direction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of your values.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about the value judgement bit, but a judgement yes,
<br>
but I aim for more than &quot;unlikely to be certainly wrong&quot; this end of
<br>
the ranging is usually despatchable quite quickly (it depends) but I
<br>
also look to a judgement on what is &quot;more likely to be right&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Please do consider ditching &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;beings&quot; from your operating language when other terms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm talking again as a political animal, not merely or mainly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophical one. I am pursuing change and very aware of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important it is to win the votes on issues in democracies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not important.  The votes are a game generally to persuade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people they actually are in control.  The counter-evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is easily found.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand this comment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Sorry just in case that was missed, the pivot point on embryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stem cell research around the world at present (politically)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speaking is whether an embryo is a human being. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is. It exists and its human. Its not a person though. So if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't want to propagate and validate the confusion we'd better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use the term person and people and personhood or some such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equivalents when we mean them instead of the less precise terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or we are running the risk of helping believers giving us social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policies whereby actually persons (sick people) cannot be given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the fullest level of care, because we've traded off their rights as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a class against the rights of some potential people (embryos) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A good point.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you, I've worked on it and I continue to work on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, it would be MUCH better to remove stem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell research and development from that which is subject to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;vote&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>If you can tell me how we can do that in practice Samantha I'd be
<br>
very interested to here it.
