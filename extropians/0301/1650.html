BBC - Telephone heart sensor under test
<br>
=======================================
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2706795.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2706795.stm</a>
<br>
<p>An implanted heart monitor which can send data down a phone line is
<br>
going on trial in the US. The device will mean that patients can be
<br>
checked by their physician while they are hundreds of miles apart.
<br>
Hopefully serious problems can be spotted before they become
<br>
life-threatening, and the patient called in for treatment.

EurekAlert - Newly discovered cellular process helps cells respond to
<br>
DNA damage
<br>
================================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/sjcr-ndc012903.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/sjcr-ndc012903.php</a>
<br>
<p>Scientists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have discovered a
<br>
novel biochemical process that plays a critical role in helping cells in
<br>
the body respond to DNA damage, such as that caused by exposure to
<br>
radiation, environmental toxins or free radicals. The findings could
<br>
lead to new approaches to prevent cancer, better ways to treat cancer
<br>
and to the development of sensitive methods determining whether people
<br>
have been exposed to radiation or environmental toxins, according to the
<br>
researchers.

News.com - Harnessing the Power of Programmed Cell Suicide
<br>
==========================================================

<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/living/Healthology/HO_cellsuicide_030128.html">http://abcnews.go.com/sections/living/Healthology/HO_cellsuicide_030128.html</a>
<br>
<p>Human genes act as the body's blueprint, with coded instructions that
<br>
tell each and every cell how to behave. But just as certain genes
<br>
determine the trajectory of a cell's life, others carry instructions
<br>
that determine its death. These suicide genes create proteins that
<br>
actually command cells to die. This natural process of cellular
<br>
hari-kari, called apoptosis, actually helps to maintain the right
<br>
balance of cellular function in the body, and suppression or
<br>
acceleration of programmed cell death can be a recipe for disaster.

Science Blog - Minimally invasive treatment successfully destroys kidney

<br>
===============================================================================

<p>A minimally invasive, experimental treatment is proving successful in
<br>
removing small kidney tumors from appropriate patients, report
<br>
researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). In a study in the
<br>
February 2003 issue of Radiology, the MGH team describes how a technique
<br>
called radiofrequency ablation (RFA) destroyed all renal cell carcinoma
<br>
(RCC) tumors less than 3 cm in size and some larger tumors, depending on

their location...

<p>Quantum computers, which use up and down atomic spin in place of binary
<br>
code zeroes and ones, may be subject to less thermal noise by losing
<br>
less energy to heat. This encouraging notion may accelerate efforts to
<br>
fabricate the first functional quantum chips.

<br>
<p>President George Bush has set course for the hydrogen economy. In his
<br>
State of the Union speech, he announced $1.2bn in research funding to
<br>
help America &quot;lead the world in developing clean, hydrogen-powered
<br>
automobiles&quot;. &quot;With a new national commitment&quot;, he said, &quot;our scientists
<br>
and engineers will overcome obstacles to taking these cars from

laboratory to showroom - so that the first car driven by a child born

today could be powered by hydrogen, and pollution-free.&quot;

<p>I didn't raise my hand. I didn't answer, &quot;Me.&quot; But after hearing the
<br>
question, I knew it was time to go. &quot;Who wants to live forever if we'd
<br>
have to live in machines?&quot; asked a leader of the Humanist organization I
<br>
joined a few years back, addressing the topic of life extension. At the
<br>
time, I was just getting seriously interested in Transhumanism. And,
<br>
coincidentally, I had just read Hans Moravec's Mind Children: The Future
<br>
of Robot and Human Intelligence, which outlines methods for uploading a
<br>
human mind into a computer, as well as why such a seemingly radical
<br>
activity could be desirable.

<p>ATM, the gene mutated in the hereditary disease ataxia-telangiectasia,
<br>
codes for a protein kinase that acts as a master regulator of cellular

responses to DNA double-strand breaks. ATM is normally inactive and the

question of how it is activated in the event of DNA damage (due to

ionizing radiation for instance) is central to understanding its function...

Space Daily - Nanodevice Breaks 1-GHz Barrier

=============================================

<a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/nanotech-03e.html">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/nanotech-03e.html</a>
<br>
<p>Nanoscientists have achieved a milestone in their burgeoning field by
<br>
creating a device that vibrates a billion times per second, or at one
<br>
gigahertz (1 GHz). The accomplishment further increases the likelihood
<br>
that tiny mechanical devices working at the quantum level can someday
<br>
supplement electronic devices for new products.
