<p>*  IRAQI EXILE DREAMS OF RESTORING LIFE TO MARSHLANDS
<br>
by Bill Spindle
<br>
Ann Arbor News, from The Associated Press, 15th January
<br>
<p>LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Azzam Alwash pulled out a large satellite image of
<br>
southern Iraq on which splotches of reddish-brown dominate the parched
<br>
landscape. He pointed to some tiny dots of blue and rivulets of green. They
<br>
are all that's left of the great marshes that once lay between the Tigris
<br>
and Euphrates rivers.
<br>
<p>&quot;I remember all the green, and that wonderful smell of decaying vegetation,&quot;
<br>
says Mr. Alwash, whose father, an Iraqi civil engineer, took his young son
<br>
on surveys into the swamps. They rode in a long wooden motor boat with a
<br>
canopy in the middle, passing communities of reed huts set among waterways
<br>
that wound for miles through the grasses. &quot;I want to do it again with my
<br>
kids,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>That won't be simple for the 44-year-old Iraqi exile. In an act of
<br>
destruction environmental groups compare with the devastation of the
<br>
rainforests of the Amazon, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered the swamps
<br>
drained in the early 1990s, when the area became a refuge for Shiite rebel
<br>
groups. The rebels were destroyed. So were the marshes, once home to the
<br>
ancient Sumerians and an area some scholars consider to be the inspiration
<br>
for the Garden of Eden.
<br>
<p>Turning a teeming swamp bigger than Florida's Everglades into a
<br>
salt-encrusted wasteland in less than a decade was no small feat.
<br>
Environmentalists are still puzzling over exactly how the Iraqi government,
<br>
which shrouded the project in secrecy, accomplished it. Bringing back the
<br>
wetlands -- once home to a half-million people and a crucial stop for
<br>
migratory birds -- will be considerably more difficult.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's virtually no water left,&quot; says Hassan Partow, a United Nations
<br>
researcher who has done a study on the destruction of the marshes. &quot;It's
<br>
absolutely phenomenal to see the destruction of an ecosystem of that scale
<br>
in just five to six years.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr. Alwash has a plan. He concedes that it's a rough plan, based on
<br>
decades-old data. He drafted it in his living room along with his geologist
<br>
wife, drawing extensively from the intimate memories of the terrain of his
<br>
father and other exiles. Even if it has to be heavily revised later, he
<br>
says, some blueprint to revive the swamps is needed if the U.S. is going to
<br>
lead an invasion to topple Mr. Hussein.
<br>
<p>If dams and waterworks upstream are bombed or rendered useless during or
<br>
after the U.S. campaign, the whole area could see an even greater ecological
<br>
disaster. In case of quick reflooding, the thick layer of salt left over
<br>
from evaporated marshes and polluted by toxins in recent years would
<br>
contaminate any new water that rushed in. The only solution, he and
<br>
environmentalists say, is to methodically flush out the salts.
<br>
<p>Mr. Alwash has lobbied Pentagon officials to avoid bombing dams and to drop
<br>
leaflets across southern Iraq urging people not to tear down waterworks. He
<br>
recently briefed a dozen officials at the U.S. Department of State. Pentagon
<br>
officials and exiled southern Iraqi opponents of Mr. Hussein attended a
<br>
presentation he gave last month at a major conference of Iraqi dissidents in
<br>
London.
<br>
<p>Mr. Alwash also argues that if the U.S. decides to lead an invasion and
<br>
occupation of Iraq, some early, visible successes in renewing the marshes
<br>
could help convince Iraqis of the benefits of working with the invaders.
<br>
&quot;This is one way to sell the idea to Iraqis, especially in the south, that
<br>
change brings tangible benefits,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>In 1978, Mr. Alwash moved to the U.S., abandoning a promising engineering
<br>
career in Iraq when he felt pressured to join a student association
<br>
affiliated with Mr. Hussein's ruling Ba'ath Party. He thought little about
<br>
the marshes as he married a geologist from a small Texas town, set about
<br>
raising two daughters and built a successful career as an engineer in
<br>
California.
<br>
<p>On a family vacation in London in 1994, Mr. Alwash attended a presentation
<br>
about the destruction of the Iraqi marshes. Environmental and human-rights
<br>
groups were then only beginning to grasp the extent of the damage. Mr.
<br>
Alwash, a kayaking buff who would sometimes muse about his childhood
<br>
adventures in the Iraqi marshlands while paddling with his wife, Suzanne,
<br>
was shocked. &quot;I'd been telling her, `One day, we'll do this in Iraq,' and
<br>
there it was in the pictures, dying,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Mr. Alwash began digging into just how the marshes were drained, relying on
<br>
Mr. Partow's U.N. environmental study for the basic outline. Starting in
<br>
1992, Iraqi engineers worked around the clock for nine months to build what
<br>
became known as the Saddam River. Some 350 miles long, it diverts water from
<br>
the Euphrates that would otherwise flow into the main al Hammar marsh.
<br>
<p>This project was followed by even larger hydroengineering schemes: the
<br>
Mother of Battles River in 1994 and the Fidelity to the Leader Canal in
<br>
1997. While the Iraqi government has always insisted that the projects were
<br>
aimed at reclaiming swampland for farming, various defectors and
<br>
environmental and human-rights groups say the scale of the projects leaves
<br>
little doubt that their goal was to destroy a huge refuge for Mr. Hussein's
<br>
opponents -- what Mr. Alwash calls Iraq's &quot;Sherwood Forest.&quot; The mud, thick
<br>
reeds and winding waterways made the area impassible for Mr. Hussein's
<br>
soldiers and heavy equipment.
<br>
<p>Eventually, Mr. Alwash saw a way he thought he could help. Many of the
<br>
environmental and human-rights groups were despairing that the marshlands,
<br>
now less than 5 percent of their original size, could ever be restored. That
<br>
is in part because new upstream dams in Turkey, Iran and Syria have reduced
<br>
the headwaters' flow to a fraction of their old volume. But Mr. Alwash knew
<br>
from his father's work that Iraqi rice and barley farmers still use
<br>
primitive and inefficient irrigation techniques. If those techniques could
<br>
be improved to reduce the amount of water diverted to farming, more water
<br>
would make it downstream to the marshes.
<br>
<p>Mr. Alwash and his wife began poring over dissertations in the libraries at
<br>
the University of California, Los Angeles. But crucial data from the period
<br>
before the drainage projects were impossible to obtain -- which is where Mr.
<br>
Alwash's father came in.
<br>
<p>Jawad Alwash grew up in southern Iraq, studied civil engineering in
<br>
Alexandria, Egypt, and then worked for decades in the southern marshes,
<br>
monitoring hydrological works and settling water disputes along the two
<br>
rivers. He retired in 1983 and was living in Baghdad when he and his wife
<br>
visited their son in the U.S. They were there when Iraq invaded Kuwait in
<br>
1990, and never went home, eventually settling near Washington.
<br>
<p>When his son described what had become of the wetlands, the senior Mr.
<br>
Alwash began teasing from his memory the flow data of rivers and channels on
<br>
satellite photos. He sketched maps for his son and daughter-in-law on scrap
<br>
paper, recalling how dams and regulators had been designed to nudge the flow
<br>
in one direction or another over the extraordinarily flat terrain. He called
<br>
former colleagues living in exile in California to tap their recollections.
<br>
One Thanksgiving at the Alwash household consisted of a turkey dinner that
<br>
was then cleared away to make room for special, high-resolution satellite
<br>
maps that the younger Mr. Alwash had finagled from U.S. government
<br>
officials.
<br>
<p>Mr. Alwash has used that information to construct a computer model that
<br>
simulates various ways to reflood the wetland areas, depending on how much
<br>
water makes it downstream from the headwaters to the agricultural zones just
<br>
above the marshes.
<br>
<p>When Mr. Hussein is no longer in power, Mr. Alwash and Suzanne, who now
<br>
spend their time delivering their presentation to any group that will
<br>
listen, hope to turn the blueprint and computer models over to Iraqi
<br>
engineers. &quot;They know their problems better than anyone,&quot; he says. Until
<br>
then, he says, &quot;this is the only wetlands-reclamation project to be done
<br>
completely by remote control.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>*  CONFRONTING IRAQ
<br>
by Robert Collier, Chronicle Staff Writer
<br>
San Francisco Chronicle, 15th January
<br>
<p>Baghdad -- To see Iraq's new elite living the fast life, go to Arasat
<br>
Street. Well- dressed diners eat steak and kebabs in glittering restaurants
<br>
with colonnaded porticos and marbled fountains, while shiny Land Cruisers
<br>
and Corvettes glide to and from towering mansions nearby.
<br>
<p>In shops down the block, snakeskin spike heels sell for $70 and a Hugo Boss
<br>
overcoat goes for $150 -- many times the average Iraqi salary of $5 to $10
<br>
per month. To judge by the sometimes bizarrely written labels, many of the
<br>
luxury items may be counterfeit, but who cares?
<br>
<p>Certainly not the new elite themselves, who are too busy making fortunes as
<br>
smugglers, helping sneak oil out of the country and other goods in --
<br>
ranging from cigarettes to weapons -- in defiance of the U.N. sanctions.
<br>
<p>&quot;They steal, they cheat. A new class of unethical people are doing very
<br>
well,&quot; said Ghazwan Al-Mukhtar, a member of Iraq's old business elite, which
<br>
has fallen on hard times lately.
<br>
<p>Just a few blocks away from Arasat Street's luxury, fellow Iraqis are living
<br>
in squalor and desperation.
<br>
<p>Youssef Al-Hakak stands in line at a government ration distribution center,
<br>
pushing a cart with the rations of wheat, sugar, tea, cooking oil and other
<br>
staples that will keep his family alive -- &quot;Inshallah&quot; (God willing), he
<br>
says. His salary as a schoolteacher, $4 a month, would barely buy him an
<br>
entree on Arasat Street.
<br>
<p>It's a tableaux that plays well with those in Washington who are pushing for
<br>
regime change in Iraq -- Saddam Hussein's enormous palaces and the feasting
<br>
of his cronies, cheek-by-jowl with the downtrodden Iraqi masses who
<br>
presumably might welcome liberation by U.S. troops.
<br>
<p>But the broader picture is more complex and more dysfunctional than that.
<br>
<p>It's more like Karl Marx meets Lewis Carroll, where class divisions are
<br>
warped in an Alice in Wonderland funhouse.
<br>
<p>A shopkeeper makes more than a heart surgeon, a taxi driver makes more in a
<br>
day than a teacher makes in a week, and a smuggler makes more than a
<br>
government minister.
<br>
<p>&quot;Iraq is a country that had a stable middle class before 1990 and a
<br>
significant welfare state,&quot; said Christopher Klein-Beekman, program
<br>
coordinator for UNICEF's $90 million-per-year Iraq mission.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now, all that has been liquidated,&quot; he added. &quot;The Western-oriented
<br>
professional class has left for the United States and Canada, and the ones
<br>
who stayed are driving taxis or just barely staying alive. And the smugglers
<br>
are gaining.&quot;
<br>
<p>While many Western observers blame Hussein and his relatives, who they say
<br>
control the smuggling and have diverted other resources for their own ends,
<br>
others hold the international sanctions at least partly responsible.
<br>
<p>The U.N.-run &quot;oil-for-food&quot; program, put into effect in 1996, mandates that
<br>
its $4.9 billion per year in oil revenues be spent on imports and explicitly
<br>
prohibits spending any funds for domestically produced products or normal
<br>
government expenses. As a result, the Iraqi government claims it has
<br>
virtually no money for salaries to pay its clerks, school teachers, doctors,
<br>
nurses and civil engineers.
<br>
<p>The government's only significant cash revenues are earned from clandestine
<br>
oil exports, estimated at $2 billion per year, and from equally clandestine
<br>
imports.
<br>
<p>No one seems to know exactly who controls this smuggling, or who owns the
<br>
gaudy mansions now being constructed in rich Baghdad neighborhoods such as
<br>
Arasat, Kerradeh and Mansour. And in a land where speaking ill of Hussein is
<br>
a severe crime, few Iraqis care to speculate.
<br>
<p>In a report released in September, however, a Washington-based nonprofit
<br>
known as the Coalition for International Justice accused Hussein and his
<br>
inner circle of skimming billions of dollars through illegal sales of oil,
<br>
smuggling and kickbacks on the trade in oil and humanitarian goods.
<br>
<p>The coalition, whose focus is monitoring human rights around the world and
<br>
lobbying for war crimes tribunals, projected the rake-off at $2.5 billion
<br>
for 2002 -- a sum large enough to significantly alleviate the tough
<br>
conditions faced by ordinary Iraqis.
<br>
<p>Iraq's new rich themselves don't seem to want to describe the source of
<br>
their money to foreign visitors. Brief conversations are more enigmatic than
<br>
informative.
<br>
<p>At one high-fashion boutique, one dyed-blonde, spike-heeled shopper paused
<br>
for small talk with a visitor while perusing fake fur coats.
<br>
<p>She bemoaned the fact that the Italian and French labels of Iraq's boom
<br>
years have been replaced by knockoffs made in China, Egypt and Pakistan.
<br>
<p>Her description of herself as a schoolteacher -- a profession that pays
<br>
almost nothing -- begged the question: So aren't these goods still too
<br>
expensive?
<br>
<p>She demurred silently with a smile. Then her husband, sleek in a long black
<br>
leather coat, swooped in from across the store and ushered her away.
<br>
<p>The Bush administration and Western media reports frequently point at the
<br>
president's eldest son, Uday Hussein, who reportedly drives a Rolls-Royce
<br>
Corniche, as the personification of the smuggler elite. Uday has been
<br>
identified in various reports as a key figure in the illegal importation of
<br>
Western cigarettes.
<br>
<p>But Baghdad-based diplomats caution that there is little hard information on
<br>
the subject and that much of the smuggling revenue may be used by the
<br>
government for normal expenses.
<br>
<p>Members of the country's old elite, such as Ghazwan Al-Mukhtar, say the
<br>
exact identity of the new upstarts is immaterial.
<br>
<p>A gaunt, elegant gentleman in his mid-50s, Al-Mukhtar spoke as he was
<br>
sitting in the faded glory of the Alwiya Club, Baghdad's leading upper-class
<br>
social club since it was founded 70 years ago, when Iraq was ruled by
<br>
Britain.
<br>
<p>Al-Mukhtar, a medical-products entrepreneur who studied engineering at UC
<br>
Berkeley and Marquette University in Milwaukee, says all his bank accounts,
<br>
amounting to millions of dollars, have been frozen in Britain since the
<br>
sanctions went into effect in 1990.
<br>
<p>Now, he lives by borrowing from his brother, a lawyer in London.
<br>
<p>&quot;My daughter, who is a fifth-year medical student, wants makeup and clothes,
<br>
&quot; he says. &quot;She needs money. I used to be able to please her just with a
<br>
chocolate bar, but no longer. My son is in his fourth year in medical
<br>
school. He needs money too.&quot;
<br>
<p>Why doesn't he become a smuggler himself? &quot;I can't work under the sanctions.
<br>
I work only with reputable companies,&quot; Al-Mukhtar replies, haughtily.
<br>
<p>As for the poor, the Iraqi government has tried to keep them under wraps.
<br>
<p>After a spate of foreign media reports about life in Baghdad's slums, the
<br>
Information Ministry &quot;minders&quot; who watch over foreign reporters have barred
<br>
them from visiting Saddam City, the sprawling shantytown on the city's
<br>
eastern outskirts that is home to about 2 million people. All other Baghdad
<br>
slums are also off-limits.
<br>
<p>But the poor -- or newly poor -- are easy enough to find. Bedraggled street
<br>
children, mothers clutching dirty-faced babies and widows in black hejabs,
<br>
or cloaks, are common sights, even though panhandling is illegal. At the
<br>
city's markets, small children are often seen scampering amid garbage piles
<br>
looking for scraps of food or salvageable items.
<br>
<p>Some of the most poignant scenes occur at the book fair that takes place
<br>
every Friday on a closed-off street in old downtown Baghdad. Spread out on
<br>
sheets are entire family libraries.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is our life, but I have no choice but to sell it,&quot; said Jawad Al-
<br>
Naimi, a government employee who was sadly watching customers pore through
<br>
his collection of history books, leather-bound philosophy treatises and
<br>
English- language novels -- including two by Agatha Christie.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is our life,&quot; he said again, slowly.
<br>
<p>Abdul Al-Baghdadi, a director of the Federation of Iraqi Chambers of
<br>
Commerce, said private citizens have suffered the most over the past several
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>&quot;The consequences of the sanctions are heavier on the people than on the
<br>
government,&quot; said Al-Baghdadi, who owns several companies that import
<br>
clothing, shoes and food. &quot;In every country, after every war, there are
<br>
people who profit. Some people here do the same.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even some top government cadres feel the personal fallout.
<br>
<p>&quot;Just yesterday, my last friend left Iraq,&quot; said Nermin Al-Mufti, a
<br>
political columnist for the El Thawra newspaper, which is run by the ruling
<br>
Ba'ath Party, and an editor of several government publications.
<br>
<p>&quot;For the past 12 years, the daily aggression of the situation has caused a
<br>
blackness that has isolated educated Iraqis,&quot; she said. &quot;Either they die, or
<br>
they leave the country, or they withdraw into themselves.
<br>
<p>&quot;Our value scale has been turned upside down. Being elegantly dressed is the
<br>
most important thing, because tomorrow doesn't exist -- you may die, who
<br>
knows?&quot;
<br>
<p>Al-Mufti then described her daily battles to obtain the medicine she needs
<br>
for a heart problem.
<br>
<p>&quot;I can't hate the smugglers. The pill I put under my tongue every day,
<br>
nitroglycerin, is forbidden under the U.N. sanctions,&quot; she said, noting that
<br>
the drug is also a common explosive with potential military use. &quot;These
<br>
smugglers have prolonged my life.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some observers say the sanctions have strengthened Hussein's regime. By
<br>
weakening the private sector and impoverishing the professional class, about
<br>
65 percent of the population depends on government rations to survive.
<br>
<p>Even in candid conversations with no government officials nearby to snoop,
<br>
some Iraqis blame the Americans more than the regime.
<br>
<p>&quot;One of my friends, one of Iraq's most prominent pathologists, very well
<br>
respected and very wealthy -- he used to be wealthy, anyway -- was recently
<br>
forced to start selling his furniture and rugs and family heirlooms,&quot; Al-
<br>
Mukhtar said, shifting upright in his worn, leather Alwiya Club chair and
<br>
stabbing the air with a lit cigarette.
<br>
<p>&quot;He only makes his government pension, worth a couple dollars a month, plus
<br>
whatever he earns at his private clinic. This wasn't caused by Saddam
<br>
Hussein.
<br>
<p>&quot;So now I curse the Americans for what has happened to my friend and me, and
<br>
I wait for the invasion. And I will curse them again when they come.&quot;
