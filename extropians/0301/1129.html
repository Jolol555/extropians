<br>
<a href="mailto:deepbluehalo@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Iraq:%20the%20case%20for%20decisive%20action">deepbluehalo@earthlink.net</a> quotes: &quot;But you have no idea what ever what goes 
<br>
through the mind of a silver haired hawk.  You know only to grab a handy 
<br>
slogan that you can shout in front of your private Amen chorus.&quot;
<br>
<p>and then writes: &quot;Fascinating. You claim to have served yet the thought of a 
<br>
young and (perhaps foolish) Marine who will never walk again does not seem so 
<br>
very horrific to you.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sir,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it that you cannot read or that you refuse to read?  My sympathies 
<br>
are entirely with those young hawks that are serving in our military.  My 
<br>
entire argument has been accepting the responsibility of seeing to it that 
<br>
our young hawks are not taken into a war and wasted.  You like Samantha wish 
<br>
to use these pages to spout slogans instead of trying to understand what is 
<br>
going on.
<br>
<p>You then said, &quot; And you think we should send them in again?  I think you 
<br>
should utilize that DD214 of yours and save some trees from being latrine 
<br>
tissue.&quot;
<br>
#Sir, I do wish you would curb your impulse to make up words to put in other 
<br>
peoples email.  You have pretended to present my position and succeeded in 
<br>
saying absolutely nothing that I recognise.  You are instead using the oldest 
<br>
and sorriest propaganda trick in the book.  You attempt to lie about me and 
<br>
my position in order to present me as less than human.  I repudiate you and 
<br>
your infantile attempts to misrepresent the position I have taken.  For shame
<br>
Ron h.
