<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This choice, either to pursue &quot;point scoring&quot; or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pursue &quot;deeper understanding&quot; seems available to each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of us each time we post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wish I had a dollar for every time on this forum this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; useless sentiment has been expressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see very little sentiment (useless or otherwise) in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statements at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay; I used the wrong word *again*.  Jeez.  I should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  said &quot;opinion&quot;.  Gimme a break.  Must I scrutinize *every*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word I use?  Could you try harder to get the drift?
</em><br>
<p>I do try pretty hard to get your drift. But the sentence in the
<br>
form you wrote it made sense so I assumed that you had 
<br>
said what you meant.  I need to assume that for efficiency in
<br>
communication when your sentences seem clear. If I think 
<br>
you are stuggling for a word or to say what you mean
<br>
&nbsp;(happens to us all) I will try really hard to 'give you a break'.
<br>
I'm interested in what you and others on this list 'think' language
<br>
is important but secondary.
<br>
<p>As you ask, imo, it possibly would be quite useful if you 
<br>
chose your words a bit more carefully sometimes, or, to say
<br>
you are speaking loosely, when you are, so that I know when
<br>
cutting slack is appropriate. To cut you slack sometimes would
<br>
be presumptious of me. Some of your stronger statements may 
<br>
be insights and I don't want to  presume that they are wrong I 
<br>
will be interested to hear why you think them if they seem to
<br>
wildly differ from my own, especially, if the point seems 
<br>
important enough.
<br>
<p>Really I think its just about whatever helps communication. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I certainly wasn't looking to do anything so pointless as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; express  mere sentiment.  I hoped to highlight a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choice that each poster gets to make each time they post -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to &quot;pursue point scoring&quot; or to &quot;pursue deeper understanding&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think there is no such choice?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I agree with you that there is often such a choice.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. If there is a time when one doesn't have a choice, that,
<br>
would be an interesting counterpoint. I think we do have a 
<br>
choice in all cases but we forget we do sometimes. As other
<br>
things are on our minds. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet what you consider to be mere point-scoring is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact often constructive criticism.  
</em><br>
<p>No. By definition. See the word mere. You can't know
<br>
that what *I* consider to be &quot;mere point-scoring&quot; is &quot;in fact&quot;
<br>
often constructive criticism. Your guessing or assuming and 
<br>
then you are imputing something to me. 
<br>
<p>I can let your assumptions go sometimes, and vice versa, 
<br>
but it doesn't help us communicate if we leave incorrect 
<br>
imputations go.  That would be to ignore misunderstanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If someone thinks that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an idea someone else has contains a serious flaw, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he should attempt to shoot the idea down. 
</em><br>
<p>Pretty much true. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that occurs, who among us isn't inclined to put another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notch on his missile launcher?
</em><br>
<p>Pretty much all of us I'd reckon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may suppose that such inclinations smack of game-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing, and yes, such a component exists.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out, however, that the whole adversarial process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of law is based upon opportunistic exploitation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these human tendencies. 
</em><br>
<p>You might. But you haven't yet. Its an interesting thesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that we should live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a balance between the utterly rigorous and detached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and sometimes boring), and the visceral.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But I come to the extropian list and communicate with
<br>
you and others at least partly because I *like* the
<br>
intellectual rigor especially when it is applied to the solving
<br>
of human problems. I can exercise my 'ol viscera anywhere.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature will take its course so far as list dynamics go,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as in all other human affairs, and the prohibitionists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually wise up and understand that suggesting tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course corrections is one thing, and profitable, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionary and radical programs are something else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and inevitably fail.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Nature&quot; may impose limits. Our freedoms rise to the
<br>
extent we can push back those limits. So I don't want
<br>
to just say &quot;whatever will be, will be&quot;.
<br>
<p>The thesis that revolutions and radical programs inevitably 
<br>
fail seems a very bold one. I'm not inclined to agree with
<br>
it at this stage. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think that if people are talking face to face either one to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one or in groups that a different set of dynamics apply than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; apply on a list where posts are sequential.  I think a list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structure favours the &quot;point scoring&quot; mindset as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the &quot;seeking deep understanding&quot; mindset more than face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to face does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I'll agree, at least to some extent.  The phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of flaming is greatly magnified by the presence of a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audience; witness the American newspapers of the 1790's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which make most on-line flame wars paltry affairs in comparison.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about the American newspapers. Its interesting.
<br>
But I'm more concerned with *our*  &quot;flame wars&quot; beause our
<br>
&quot;flame wars&quot; are &quot;flame wars&quot; between the good-guys and they
<br>
&quot;burn&quot; *us*.  I think an enormous amount can be achieved thru
<br>
the willing cooperation of a few good minds and this list is
<br>
a gold mine for good minds.
<br>
<p>Though watching it is a bit like watching the movie Gettysburg
<br>
(the one with Martin Sheen as General Lee). I like that movie
<br>
because neither side is caricatured as villains, both sides show
<br>
essentially decent folk struggling heroically but tragically. Just
<br>
a real darn shame the enemies we choose are so often each 
<br>
other. Its not like heroism is meaningless. Or our human 
<br>
propensity to fight cannot be redirected sometimes at least to 
<br>
good effect. Hell let's fight death - the ancestral enemy. Let's
<br>
collectively kick it's butt around the block for a couple of
<br>
millenia or longer at least.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we are talking here about one's adversarial nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or opinionated nature, which is simply set differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in different people.
</em><br>
<p>Yes people vary along that dimension I think.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Get a crowd around a couple of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usual Extropian wranglers at someone's house after an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extro conference, and I predict you'll see I'm right.
</em><br>
<p>Ok. I don't know. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why, I've often had many quite heated and totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  argumentative  discussions alone with a close friend. 
</em><br>
<p>:-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To take my former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, fire and ice, (i.e., Mike Lorrey and Anders Sandberg),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be quite interesting to find out if Mike would lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders' boiling point, or Anders would raise Mike's, in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face to face discussion, though probably not as interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as attending to what they were actually saying. 
</em><br>
<p>Well maybe. But I can think of better 'engagements' for the likes
<br>
of folk of the calibre of both these guys than for them to amuse
<br>
you or I by having at each other.
<br>
<p>Your use of the word &quot;probably&quot; is a bit of a worry ;-) Your
<br>
not one of those morbid 'road accident' 'vultures' I hope. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is easier to tell in the more context rich face to face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment if people are serious, interested, in the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a conversation that matters to them or merely shooting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the breeze, and so in a face to face circumstances I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;point scoring&quot; debater mindset would stand out more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blatantly as rude and damaging and that people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; therefore do it less as a consequence of the richer feedback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they'd get.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, that doesn't match my experience very well. 
</em><br>
<p>Ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I know (at work, for example) usually are tending towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you'd call the &quot;point-scoring&quot; end of the continuum, (what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd call the adversarial mode), when, say political matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up. 
</em><br>
<p>Ok
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What are your experiences with people, both as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer and participant?
</em><br>
<p>Well they vary I guess. I'm a pretty analytical specimen and I'm 
<br>
quite interested in psychology and politics, so I've learnt a bit
<br>
about them. I think there are some things I learnt in social psych
<br>
at uni that were not at all the same sort of insights that I imaging
<br>
*necessarily* come to people who are *only* drawing on 
<br>
reasonably good intelligence and common sense. Sometimes two
<br>
explanations provided by common sense can be in conflict.
<br>
<p>Eg. Which is more true the aphorism that &quot;opposites attract&quot; or
<br>
that &quot;birds of a feather flock together&quot;?R.
<br>
<p>Obviously, to a certain extent it depends, but studying social psych
<br>
in a formal way helped me, I think, understand better, on *what* it 
<br>
depends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Consider the exchange between Anders and Mike:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Anders wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One prerequisite for having a constructive discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about a powerful topic is to be able to handle it on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of  abstraction. When you know enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a topic you can start to look at it from different sides. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can be abstract enough about it so that you become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dispassionate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike replied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the contrary, the more you know about a topic, when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that topic turns on Objective Truth, the more likely you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be very passionate for the side which you are able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objectively, quantitatively, and qualitatively determine is in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the right. The opposition begins, more and more, to look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not just wrong, but foolish, naive, stubbornly obstinate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their willful ignorance, and willing to believe anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that agrees with their prejudices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It's quite clear that the more someone learns about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; issue, the less affected is his or her basic personality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; disposition!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure what your saying. It seems that, your saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that, as the amount of knowledge one has on a subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increases one's personality (or) personal disposition, is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less (e)ffected by each further unit increment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, it was a joke, or at least was rather ironical, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrase it just that way.  It misfired (my fault). 
</em><br>
<p>Ok
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say that their basic personality dispositions are hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affected at all by how much they learn about a matter
</em><br>
<p>Well this is an interesting thesis. 
<br>
<p>But note: affected and effected are *both* valid in your 
<br>
sentence but mean different things. I think you probably
<br>
meant effected.  
<br>
<p>But its still a thesis that whilst interesting wants for support
<br>
to validate it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some notable exceptions in some people and on some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  topics---  I have noticed that I shut up, or at least become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  much more conciliatory after someone has made me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize an error that  I had been making).
</em><br>
<p>Ok. I'm *sure* you actually do change your behavior
<br>
based on how you perceive things. 
<br>
<p>But probably we are all both a bit more interested in
<br>
ourselves and intimately acquainted with ourselves so perhaps
<br>
we don't always give others the credit we give to ourselves.
<br>
<p>In fact there is a social pysch phenomenon, at least one,
<br>
called the &quot;fundamental attribution error&quot; that is based on this
<br>
theme.
<br>
<p>Social psych's found by experiment, that we tend to see our 
<br>
own behaviours as more likely to be determined by the
<br>
situation in which we find ourselves (ie. we see ourselves as
<br>
sensitive, adapting and reactive in a good way), whereas we
<br>
tend to see others in the same situation where the observable 
<br>
behavior is the same as having acted the way they did more 
<br>
out of personal disposition and less out of a response to the 
<br>
particular situation in which the person finds themselves.
<br>
<p>Simple example if one stumble's in a crowd, one might be
<br>
more likely to think one was pushed, whereas if I one see
<br>
someone else stumble in a crowd one is more likely to think
<br>
they are clumsy and tripped.
<br>
<p>In a variety of circumstance this simple &quot;fundamental 
<br>
attribution error&quot; is exercised in real life. I see behavior as 
<br>
others do. But sometimes for reasons that are to do with
<br>
my interest or my education I may see things differently or
<br>
with some extra context because I have a framework in which
<br>
I can interpret social behvior which is a least a bit based on
<br>
a formal study of it.
<br>
<p>So I do think that you or anyone else should automatically
<br>
assume that I am right and they are wrong if our i
<br>
interpretations of a situation differ? Hell no! I can and do
<br>
stuff up frequently and I know it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Those who start by being quite opinionated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; remain that way, and those who tend to reserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; judgment,  have &quot;working hypotheses&quot;, be indecisive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and so on, tend to remain their way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't agree with the view that having a working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  hypothesis and  indecision amount to the same thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which seems to be what you are saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the wrong word again.  Replace &quot;indecisive&quot; with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;less decisive&quot;.  I only mean the opposite of &quot;quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinionated&quot;  which maybe you should have picked up on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And neither speaker here is distinguishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; between ordinary discussions of near-fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and discussions laced with ideology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not sure I could hold someone to blame for not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distinguishing  &quot;near-fact&quot; from anything. What is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; near-fact? How near?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By &quot;near-fact&quot; I was trying to connote troublesome examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that should be matters of fact, but which are, for various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons, [are ] not, e.g., historical accounts.  We probably are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best off to view the difference between facts and opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as also on a continuum, though with the two ends more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prominent than in many other continuums.
</em><br>
<p>Well I'd have a preference for keeping a perfectly good
<br>
word like fact as it is and using likelihood or something myself
<br>
but it doesn't matter much for present purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As an example of what I was talking about, suppose that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific discussion of &quot;entropy&quot; was in progress, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose that there aren't any strong ideological movements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separating people's views about entropy. 
</em><br>
<p>Ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What Anders and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike said, while entirely correct IMO for discussions like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, was not correct when considering ideological debates.
</em><br>
<p>Ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders had written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    When you know enough about a topic you can start to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    look at it from different sides.  You can be abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    enough about it so that you become dispassionate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is true enough, if you are talking about entropy.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it fails spectacularly if you (most people) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about the Vietnam War.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it's perhaps not as true in this case as it is in the 
<br>
case of entropy, but I think I still agree with Anders
<br>
contention even on a point like the Vietnam War even 
<br>
given that it does have a lot of additional dimensions about
<br>
&nbsp;it and &quot;truth&quot; is not so clear cut or demonstrable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is *extremely* difficult not to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; somewhat biased perspective on the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [ideological] issues, and only a fool has
</em><br>
<p>I agree its generally extremely difficult for people
<br>
to be retain a dispassionate perspective about
<br>
ideology. I think some may do it better than 
<br>
others but probably all of us do it less well than
<br>
we think we do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; such prejudices about matters of fact!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But now you seem to be moving near-fact into fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  It would be hasty to call someone a fool for

<p>Sorry for the long-windedness in this post Lee, (and 
<br>
any readers). I found myself thinking this
<br>
thread was becoming a bit too introspective and getting
<br>
of topic.
<br>
<p>Stuff above me personally is only that. I don't
<br>
assume that its interesting to people (or not).
<br>
<p>I wanted to respond to open questions openly.

<p>[Aside: I reckon there is more merit in developing the 
<br>
thread on who &quot;decides myself&quot;, but that's just
<br>
me. Please feel free to prune this post ruthlessly for 
<br>
relevance or otherwise to the subject header].
