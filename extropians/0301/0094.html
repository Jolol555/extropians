From: Lee Daniel Crocker 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That was Lee Corbin, but I take your point.&lt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, forgive me Lee. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  His lack of quantifier
</em><br>
is confusing, and may be intepreted by some to indicate disjoint or
<br>
unrelated sets.  Likewise, your unqualified &quot;Extropy is a
<br>
transhumanist philosophy&quot; is unclear for the same reason--it can be
<br>
misinterpreted as stating an equivalence relation rather than a
<br>
subset.&lt;
<br>
<p>Yes, I agree and this is a point I have thought abuot for about a decade
<br>
:-) And, even with all that time on my hands thinking abuot it, I still do
<br>
not have a definitive answer.  When I think of transhumans, I think of
<br>
FM-2030 and Damien Broderick.  when I think of transhumanism, I think of
<br>
Max More.  When I think of transhumanits, I think of Natasha Vtia-More. 
<br>
When I think of transhumanity, I think of a wide culture of diverse
<br>
transhumans and transhumanists.  Each suffux coinage of &quot;transhuman&quot; has a
<br>
slightly different meaning for me due to, in very large part, the way it
<br>
has been used and referenced.
<br>
<p>But, Extropy is clearly a Philosophy of transhumanism.  There is no other
<br>
philosophy of transhumanism at this time.  That's the bottom line.  Now,
<br>
you might ask, Isn't transhumanism a philosophy?  Max might say yes, in
<br>
deference to his definition of the word and what he meant by it in its
<br>
first publication.  I happend to think of transhumanity as prepresenting an
<br>
ideology, not a philosophy.  FM was deeply opposed to transhuman as being a
<br>
movement, but then he was unaware of the memetic propagation on the
<br>
Internet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I'm just being picky in the other direction; I want to make
</em><br>
it clear that Extropians are a distinct subset of the transhumanist
<br>
movement without our own values and philosophies.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We don't really disagree here, it's just that you want to
</em><br>
emphasize common ground, while I think it's more important to
<br>
emphasize our differences.&lt;
<br>
<p>I agree with the above.  But, we must not subtract extropy or extropians
<br>
from transhumanism, transhumanits, transhumanity and definitly not
<br>
transhuman.
