Betterhumans - Protein Causes Cancer to Self-destruct
<br>
=====================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-25-1">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-25-1</a>
<br>
<p>A protein that causes up to 70% of cancer cells to self-destruct has
<br>
been discovered by US researchers. The protein interferes with the
<br>
enzyme Cox-2, which is involved in the generation of blood vessels that
<br>
feed cancer cells. Cox-2 has increasingly become a target of cancer
<br>
research.

<br>
<p>ATM, the product of the gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is
<br>
involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and has been implicated
<br>
in telomere maintenance. Atm mutant mice display modest aging and growth
<br>
retardation defects compared to A-T patients. In an Advanced Online
<br>
Publication in Nature Wong et al. describe studies in mice to assess the
<br>
interaction between ATM and telomeres...

<p>Researchers announced on Tuesday that they had successfully created two

scientists study networks: collections of people or objects connected to

each other in some way. Think of the 1.5 million Manhattan residents or

the 30,000 genes inside a human cell. Such networks, scientists argue,

behave in ways that can't be understood solely in terms of their

component parts. Without knowing what every single person or object

within the network is doing, they say, it's nevertheless possible to

know something about how the network as a whole behaves...
