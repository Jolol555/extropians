<em>&gt;     &gt; I like free speech AND defamation laws.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mutually exclusive.
</em><br>
<p>### Yeah, right.
<br>
<p>----------------
<br>
&nbsp;In the long run everybody would benefit if
<br>
<em>&gt; defamation laws were abolished, except for trial lawyers. You seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that if we didn't have libel laws the sum total of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputations in a society would go down, I don't see how that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen and don't see how it would matter if it did, reputation is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative scale after all. I think libel laws just make reputations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more inaccurate.
</em><br>
<p>### Exactly, you put it very well - the sum total of all reputations would
<br>
be reduced. In a bazaar of uncheckable claims, there is no way of separating
<br>
the wheat from chaff. The easier it is to verify the truth or falsity of a
<br>
statement, the better, whether it is achieved by universal transparency, or
<br>
competing, libertarian courts.
<br>
<p>-----------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;  Free speech can sometimes  be cheap speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It usually is, but so what? If I say bad things about you it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only be really damaging to you if my reputation is good. If I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of making similar charges that turned out to be untrue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything I say will just be shrugged off. I think a free market of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas should determine what is true and what is not, the idea of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an official body making such a decree gives me the creeps.
</em><br>
<p>### You should be absolutely free to shrug off the opinions of the official
<br>
body (the jury), I agree. But those who trust a group of randomly selected,
<br>
financially uninvolved citizens more than a religious, or political group,
<br>
or a direct economic competitor, will have the option of incorporating the
<br>
jury's findings into their decisions.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;By leveraging knowledge of the law one can  delegate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not delegate to your potential customers, let them figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what your reputation should be.
</em><br>
<p>### Simple - the transaction costs are too high. The cost of finding out the
<br>
truth is too high for your customers to pay, and this is why a court (paid,
<br>
ideally, by the losing side of the suit) is the right body to find and make
<br>
the truth freely available.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The successful ones will be those who
<br>
<em>&gt; have correctly determined what your reputation should be, those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want to do business with you because they incorrectly think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your reputation is too low will soon be put out of business by those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who make the correct judgments.
</em><br>
<p>### Your customers who incorrectly conclude you are a poor milk producer (by
<br>
believing libelous claims that your cows suffer from the BGH you use, while
<br>
in fact the cows are doing just fine), will suffer only minor economic
<br>
damage. On the other hand, all progressive farmers, who want to use BGH,
<br>
will be scared of boycotts, leading to higher prices.
<br>
<p>Defamation laws, correctly formulated (not the same as today), do improve
<br>
economic efficiency, therefore they are to be supported.
