<em>&gt; (Brett Paatsch &lt;<a href="mailto:paatschb@ocean.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Internet%20and%20defamation%20laws%20(was%20Re:%20Oil%20Economics)">paatschb@ocean.com.au</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting. The Onion is obviously a farcical publication aimed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at stirring and joshing rather than reporting. Fair enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But given it actually includes photos (or digital likenesses) of Bush 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and purports at least superficially to quote him, I wonder, in light of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a recent High Court decision on internet publication and defamation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Australia whether The Onion and its ilk might be in danger of sticking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their neck out too far and becoming actionable under defamation (libel) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law....
</em><br>
<p>Unlike Australia, Germany, and many other so-called free societies,
<br>
the U.S. still takes free expression pretty seriously.  I don't
<br>
think any court in the country would even hear such a case against
<br>
the Onion, because parody, especially political satire, has always
<br>
been the most strongly protected of all.  Libel and slander suits
<br>
here have a very high bar: they have to prove that (1) the statements
<br>
were false, (2) that the speaker knew or should have known that they
<br>
were false, (3) that they were presented as factual (i.e., not
<br>
parody or satire), (4) that actual harm was caused by them, and in
<br>
the case of &quot;public figures&quot;, (5) that there was actual malice in
<br>
the speaker's intent.  Even the UK, which is better about free speech
<br>
than most of Europe, allows libel and slander suits with much less.
<br>
<p>While I don't for a moment thnk our system is perfect, I'm proud
<br>
to live in a country where a magazine can publish a parody about
<br>
Jerry Falwell screwing his mother in an outhouse.
