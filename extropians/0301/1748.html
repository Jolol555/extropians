<em>&gt;&gt; Moreover, wind farms are incredibly land intensive. Three newly
</em><br>
proposed wind farms in West Virginia would occupy 30 to 40 square miles
<br>
but would produce slightly less electricity than a new 265 MW gas-fired
<br>
combined-cycle generating plant, which would occupy a few acres. Sallie
<br>
Baliunas at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, estimates,
<br>
using very conservative assumptions, that producing enough hydrogen with
<br>
wind power to replace just one-third of the vehicles on the road today
<br>
would require 210,000 square miles. In reality, that number would likely
<br>
be much higher.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
Couldn't these be built in the desert where the land has limited use for
<br>
anything else?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Couldn't solar arrays be place between the wind mills to increase the
<br>
energy output per acre?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Even geothermal could be colocated in the same area.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
All these forms of energy generation could use much of the same
<br>
infrastructure.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Plants farther away on the power grid near plentiful water could
<br>
generate the hydrogen.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Also isn't the oxygen produced as a byproduct by the process also useful
<br>
in other forms of energy production such as the incineration  of waste
<br>
at high temperature?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Colocation of multiple forms of power generation should reduce the cost
<br>
of each!

<p>&lt;&lt;The &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; has been promoted for years by environmental
<br>
activists and alternative-energy gurus like Amory Lovins. But hydrogen
<br>
is not a source of energy, something which hydrogen advocates either
<br>
don't understand or refuse to acknowledge. Since hydrogen does not exist
<br>
in geological reservoirs it must be extracted from fossil-fuel
<br>
feedstocks or water. The process of extracting hydrogen uses energy,
<br>
which means that using hydrogen is less efficient that burning fossil
<br>
fuels. And if you're worried about global warming you certainly don't
<br>
want to go that route. As a recent energy-technology review in Science
<br>
magazine pointed out last November, &quot;Per unit of heat generated, more
<br>
CO2 is produced by making H2 [hydrogen] from fossil fuel than by burning
<br>
the fossil fuel directly.&quot; &gt;&gt;
