At a very basic level, belief is not only necessary, but is present in 
<br>
everyone, whether they deny it or not.  Without belief you couldn't walk 
<br>
across the room.  To do so requires believing in the possibility and the 
<br>
desireability.  And this belief is always based on non-logically derived 
<br>
axioms.
<br>
<p>Still... there are degrees and degrees.  Some beliefs appear, to those 
<br>
who do not hold them, less rational than others.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I would argue rather that the world we are living in is a direct 
<br>
consequence of our beliefs.  Certainly with respect the the predicted 
<br>
future outcomes of possible choices.  (Here I am using the word belief 
<br>
to refer to those not logically justifiable foundation premesis upon 
<br>
which our decisions for action are based, and separate from the sensory 
<br>
input data.  The beliefs are necessary in order to *interpret* the 
<br>
sensory data.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Even conventional religious folks often belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; in and practice good stewardship of resources in this life. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
While true, I would argue that religious belief patterns were originally 
<br>
designed to bind the tribe together for coordinated actions, and that 
<br>
more modern derived customs tie into the same inherrent patterns.  Note 
<br>
that the word religion comes from re-ligio meaning to bind together.  
<br>
Thus they were useful without needing to be true, or even related 
<br>
sensibly to the true/false axis.  In fact, modern religions have 
<br>
intentionally distanced themselves from relating to true/false.  
<br>
(Frequently they claim to be not true, but TRUE!, which is a clue.)  
<br>
They rarely dare even consider whether or not they are still useful, or 
<br>
whether they have become merely addictive processes.  But they always 
<br>
claim a foundation which cannot be tested in any objective fashion.  And 
<br>
they are right to do so.  That's not where they are rooted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe that real rights are something granted by the society 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that they must be paid for by duties/responsibilities to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society.  I do of course agree that it is foolish not to live in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality instead of fantasies.  But human rights are a mockery if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are merely what your tribe deigns to give you and determines the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payment for. 
</em><br>
<p>In some sense, human rights are a mockery.  In another sense, these 
<br>
&quot;rights&quot; are the goals that the civilization is striving for.  Do people 
<br>
have the right to speak freely?  Without getting hurt?  This demands 
<br>
government enforcement, as otherwise the local bully will stop you.  But 
<br>
the government is just a distant bully, who's bigger than the local 
<br>
one.  So there is a social contract that limits the actions of this 
<br>
distant bully.  (This contract seems to be getting frayed as computers 
<br>
and communications bring the distant bully closer.  Whoops!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Problem is when citizens try to rely on rights that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; underwritten by real responsibilities they find those rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cannot be relied on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree strongly with your entire model of rights here. 
</em><br>
<p>Rights cannot, per se, be relied on.  And it doesn't matter how 
<br>
righteously you personally have acted.  Rights are a social contract, 
<br>
and only exist in the context of that contract.  When the balence of 
<br>
power shifts drastically, expect that the social contract will be 
<br>
re-written by the party with a new and more dominant role.  Seen in this 
<br>
way, rights act to limit the violence within a society, much as a 
<br>
pecking order does in a flock of chickens.  The arguments are over how 
<br>
much control the central authorities shall have over what actions.  (And 
<br>
over what intermediate authorities will be allowed to exist.)
<br>
N.B.:  As the approaching singularity causes frequent changes in the 
<br>
balence of power, expect turmoil as first one group and then another 
<br>
attempts to rewrite the social contract to their own benefit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; When you have employed reason and cannot reach a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; but you have to choose, what do you do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I make a provisional assessment, or if need be a final assessment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as dictated by the need to reach a decision as best I can given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ...  I aim for more than &quot;unlikely to be certainly wrong&quot; this end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the ranging is usually despatchable quite quickly (it depends) but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; also look to a judgement on what is &quot;more likely to be right&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Voting is becoming a charade that really effects nearly nothing imho.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The government is generally out of control of the people. Having the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people vote even super-rationally will not imo likely be sufficient to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring it under control. 
</em><br>
<p>This seems true.  Perhaps voting irrationally would be more successful, 
<br>
it could hardly be less so.
<br>
OTOH, the recent electronic voting machines in my area have no audit 
<br>
trail, so it is quite possible that the vote will come out to the 
<br>
desired result, no matter which way people vote.  I'm not even sure that 
<br>
refraining from voting would be counted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry just in case that was missed, the pivot point on embryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stem cell research around the world at present (politically)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; speaking is whether an embryo is a human being. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it is. It exists and its human. Its not a person though. So if we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;Of course&quot;?  I think we have a trouble here with a definition of 
<br>
terms.  I would agree if you said it was becomming a human being, but 
<br>
&quot;is&quot;?  This seems to be a case where artificial sharp boundaries are 
<br>
being imposed to make decisions easier, as opposed to correct or 
<br>
rational.  (OK.  You seem to want to reserve the term person for special 
<br>
use, but do remember that this term is already much overloaded, meaning 
<br>
everything from the tentacle of a Man o' War to an individual specially 
<br>
choosen to speak to and for god. )  If you say &quot;an embryo is, of course, 
<br>
a human&quot;, then you are accepting terminology that will bias the decision 
<br>
of the argument.  Even if you were to specify a precise definition... is 
<br>
one cell a human?  What if researchers determine how to turn somatic 
<br>
tissue into totipotent stem cells, and grow an entire new body from one 
<br>
cell?  If not, why not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reimpose strict Constitutional limits on what the government has any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to stick its nose in.  Exactly how we would get there from here 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a very good question.  It is also one I think we better put some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable effort into answering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>A very important step.  An this is the least of the reasons why.  But as 
<br>
to how.....?
