<p>I don't suppose that you noticed the year in that post (1987), which
<br>
was right in the middle of the period where we were really arming the
<br>
Mujahedeen with Stingers, etc. If Bin Laden was our buddy and our pet
<br>
muslim, why then did he threaten the life of the Colonel? The fact is
<br>
that our support for the Mujahedeen threatened his influence with them,
<br>
which was supported by money from the muslim world, primarily his own
<br>
family and the Saudi family, not from us. He saw us as competitors and
<br>
threats to his power.
