<em>&gt;     &gt; In a nutshell, [Laws against defamation are needed] because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; people rely on their reputations for their  livelihood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it would be wrong for me to charge somebody with libel, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation should be determined by those who use it, that is by everybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except me.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough. Some folks are perhaps better able to shrug off petty slights
<br>
and one does not need to actually pursue a defamation case if one does
<br>
not want to.
<br>
<p>But it can take a lifetime of careful and fair dealing to earn a person the
<br>
sort of good reputation that enables their name to act as a brand and for
<br>
them to get serious things done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In the long run it is their best interests that my reputation be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither too high nor too low but accurate, as for me I just want it to be
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; high as possible and hang the truth. Best if they decide what is true or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false not me.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately &quot;they&quot; includes both ones customers and ones competitors.
<br>
<p>If one has a competitor with a bad reputation that competitors best way
<br>
to level the playing field may be to attack the reputation of others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;truth alone is not sufficient  defence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If the law supposes that, 'said Mr. Bumble'  the law is a ass, a idiot.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charles Dickens from Oliver Twist
</em><br>
<p>A good point.
<br>
<p>I like the way that in trials they ask people if they'll swear to tell the
<br>
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
<br>
<p>Then later they ask a question that must be answered yes or no and
<br>
their is no possibility of the whole truth coming out.
<br>
<p>Yeah the laws an ass. But what's the alternative?
