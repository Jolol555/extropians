One of us has wandered off into the tall grass and started arguing about mom and
<br>
apple pie with the wildlife. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The original question had to do with Santa Machining a Lamborghini engine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lamborghinis and ICUs in general are an anachronism in context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; santamachining. You could make them, eventually, but no one in her sane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind would.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now we're talking about polymer circuits, I thought. And thin-film 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells, and displays, and stuff. Maybe some actuators, even.
</em><br>
<p>Permit me to refresh your swap space:

<em> &gt; Its about time rapid prototyping machines and polytronic printing were

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Ablative materials are probably not the best choice for IC cylinder parts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Or for close tolerance turbines. So that whole angle is a strawman in context,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So don't use ablative materials. But no one will be needing ICUs nor
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Again, your context is not the context in which I was speaking (see above),
<br>
so nyanyaNYA!
<br>
<p>Sigh.
