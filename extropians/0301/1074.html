</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; True. I wasn't thinking complete as-is cross-posting. Say, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wiki posts are sent to a mailing list (suitably auto-fake-quoting for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; context), or put into a bulletin board under the same scheme. Replies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those may or may not go back into the Wiki, depending on how you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; work things and whether the Wiki maintains its own comments sections for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; each entry or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is there really is no sense of a &quot;wiki post&quot; -- well, a page
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be edited.  So, are you suggesting to send out the entire page's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contents every time someone edits it?  Even if the edit is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correcting a typo in a single word?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eerg.  Ouch.
</em><br>
<p>Nothing quite so drastic, as what you quote can be fairly intelligently
<br>
sectioned automatically, but along those lines. Editing a page is a &quot;wiki
<br>
post.&quot; You can also have a wiki with a comments section for each section (so
<br>
that people can discuss potential edits) which is something like a threaded
<br>
forum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Posting to a Wiki is still, topologically, a conversation. So I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they're viable things for some sort of inclusion in the planned grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tranhumanist information exchange.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I see pages in a wiki as a snapshot or moment in time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representing the collective voiced consciousness of a group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributors.  By examining it at a specific point in time there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to be certain of who contributed what, even given &quot;signatures&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that suggest someone contributed something specific as someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have edited it without subsequently signing it themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but you lose so much information by viewing it that way. A commented
<br>
change history could be a conversation unto itself (and I presume often is,
<br>
since groups tend to consult amongst themselves in the course of updating
<br>
valued wikis). I think there's value in keeping all these subthreads of
<br>
community conversation.
