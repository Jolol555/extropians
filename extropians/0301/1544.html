I hope this script will appear in linear form, and not java-nated! :-(  Appologies if it appears scattered.

<p>&lt;&lt;I can't believe it, How dare they try to show the world that these false hope giving leaches are fake. It outragous. They give truly gifted Psychics like myself a bad name. And before you say anything, I know what you are going to say, So don't. 
<br>
<p>Just to prove that my paranormal abilities are real i'll prove it to you.

<p><p>I saw John Edward in Columbus, Ohio. He basically does a cold reading, and then, despite claims to the contrary, edits the show. Incidently, South Park did a laugh-riot take-off on Edwards and depicted him by name. Cartman was brought to the Edward show in NYC, because he inadvertantly swallowed the ashes of Kenny; who had been slain in a previous episode (mistaking Kenny's ashes for chocolate-powder). 
<br>
<p>Kyle attempts to bust Edward, but winds up with his own cold-reading Psychic show. His audience won't believe he's not psychic. The show actually goes to considerable pains (for a cartoon) to explain how cold readings work. Cartman goes on to Scotland, for a magic ceremony, by Chef's mother, to remove Kenny's soul from Cartman. Kenny's soul winds up in an unfortunate slab of roast beef, which is later eaten by comic actor, Rob Schneider.
<br>
<p>I would find it surprising if Edward, can successfully pander to even the lowest element of British television watching. My guess is, it would be a no-sell. South Park, on the Other hand...  :^)
