Lee Corbin sez:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see the harm in bringing things to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, and do see harm in letting them lie dead.
</em><br>
<p>That which never existed is not *dead*, even in Pluto's Republic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, even here is a case where the tradeoffs aren't clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.  The Irish are better off being bred and slaughtered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than they would be if the British didn't bother raising them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I ask only that they be treated well before they're killed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the killing be done as painlessly as possible.  It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a sad day for the Irish race when people no longer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to eat them.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, Lee didn't say that, Dean Swift did.
