Eliezer had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; If your intuitions about when something is &quot;your business&quot; end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; up with you intervening at much the same points as someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; intervenes depending on their intuitions as to whether something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; is, as you put it, BAD, then what have you accomplished?
</em><br>
<p>and I responded to that with
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Oh, a great deal has been accomplished!  The whole emphasis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on when we should intervene has been changed, and, IMO will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be found to be much more in accordance with practical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time-tested laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um... the morality we're trying to maximize seems to me to occupy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a logically prior level to determining which laws are &quot;time-tested&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insofar as morality would provide the fitness metric against which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I determined which particular laws are good or bad.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we may indeed wish to investigate ultimate moral axioms
<br>
and preferences at the highest level first.  But I guess that
<br>
I did answer your question:  namely, just before taking an
<br>
action, someone may be giving one of these memes the biggest
<br>
share of run time:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Do I like what so-and-so is doing?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Is it any of my business what so-and-so is doing?
<br>
<p>Your original question was whether there is any difference.
<br>
I suppose that I have explained how (or by now it is obvious)
<br>
that there is such a behavioral difference.  This is not to
<br>
say that A isn't very important---as you say, one has to
<br>
establish the principles inherent in one's moral system.
<br>
I would suggest merely that B start getting more run time
<br>
in people than it has seemed to in recent decades.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  More later in regard to your other points
