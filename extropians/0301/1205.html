<p><em>&gt; I'm sure you'll agree that mathematics of any kind is properly defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a type of &quot;formal&quot; logic (if not, then I have no idea what you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by &quot;formal&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>No, people don't usually consider arithmetic to be formal logic,
<br>
for example.  IN all the cases I've encountered, formal logic
<br>
means the use of sentences of the predicate calculus, or at
<br>
least the statement calculus.
<br>
<p>For example, <a href="http://dec59.ruk.cuni.cz/~peregrin/HTMLTxt/log&amp;mea.htm">http://dec59.ruk.cuni.cz/~peregrin/HTMLTxt/log&amp;mea.htm</a><br>
<p>&quot;At approximately the same time at which the linguistic turn was finding expression in the writings of Russell, Wittgenstein, Carnap
<br>
and others, another important event, closely connected with it, took place as well. This was the birth of formal logic in the strict
<br>
sense.
<br>
To avoid misunderstanding, let us stress the difference between formal logic and logic that is merely symbolic. Both formal and
<br>
symbolic logic are based on the substitution of symbols for natural language statements and expressions; however, whereas within the
<br>
merely symbolic approach symbols are employed solely for the purpose of regimentation (in Quine's sense), i.e. of suppressing those
<br>
aspects of natural language expressions which are considered irrelevant for the analysis of consequence, within the truly formal
<br>
approach the resulting systems of symbols - logical calculi - are taken to be abstract algebraic structures. Aristotle used letters
<br>
to represent unspecific terms; hence he could be considered an early symbolic logician. Frege and Russell were symbolic logicians
<br>
par excellence; but neither of them was a formal logician.4
<br>
It was Hilbert who for the first time viewed logic as a strictly formal matter...&quot;
<br>
<p>Or you can do other Google searches and see what &quot;formal logic&quot;
<br>
usually means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I doubt very much that Darwin could have arrived at his theory without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an understanding of formal mathematics, even if only of simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arithmetic.
</em><br>
<p>You could be correct, psychologically.  I really don't know.
<br>
But I do know that in his writings he practically never brings
<br>
up mathematics.  So far as I know.
<br>
<p>But I don't think that the meaning of &quot;formal logic&quot; changed while
<br>
Einstein was alive.  I think that he simply misspoke.
