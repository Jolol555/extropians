<p><em>&gt; Yes, churches dwell upon the blight of people.  It gives them more control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the flock.  Being poor, ignorant and young helps.  Which is where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catholics had it &quot;right&quot; once again, when they try to keep the woman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [barefoot] and pregnant, eternally setting children into the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and why they idiotically insist against birth control in the poorest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starving countries.
</em><br>
<p>Historically the case can be made against the Church much in 
<br>
the manner you have made it.  However, a number of modern
<br>
researchers (e.g. Julian Simon) no longer believe that 
<br>
population growth is inversely related to prosperity.  If
<br>
anything, I suspect a positive correlation, though compared
<br>
to other factors, it's pretty minor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Their position is logical in regards to the well-being of the superpersonal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembly 'Catholic Church', but it really sucks in regards to individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hardliners maintain that if the choice is between a disabled person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and a non-disabled person being instantiated, then they prefer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; former.  Personally, I disagree with them, but it may come down to who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should decide, and whether a disabled person should have the legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right to conceive another disabled person.  At moments like this I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tend to lose my temper and shout WHOSE BUSINESS IS IT ANYWAY?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A physically disabled person, I presume. (Mentally severely disabled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons have guardians, which decide for them).
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes!  If the disabled person wishes to naturally have
<br>
children passing on his or her disability, or wishes to get
<br>
cloned, it's none of our business to meddle up to the point
<br>
of using force to prevent it!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given a known high risk I would say that's borderline criminally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negligent in regards to the child.  
</em><br>
<p>Now you seem to have switched to the other side.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It also incurs costs on the society, which in this case should be carried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the parents (e.g. via a disability insurance) since preventable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the parents deliberately choose to reject an available procedure which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have resulted in a healthy child (let's say embryo screening for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usual chromosome aberration and a library of known genetic defects)  I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say this crosses the line.  Whose business is it?  The society's.
</em><br>
<p>I can't believe that you've been a member of this list without
<br>
knowing how many people are going to wince at that usage.
<br>
Society!?   Do you think things to be society's fault and
<br>
society's business??  Our civilization advances directly
<br>
in proportion to the degree that it is realized that the
<br>
focus must be on the individual, not the state or society.
<br>
<p>You surely know how many crimes have been carried out in
<br>
&quot;society's&quot; name (though I am of course not personally
<br>
accusing you of endorsing those crimes, duh)?  Concerns
<br>
about society invariably lead to centralization and
<br>
social planning, and it looks like it won't be for
<br>
decades yet that people get it through their heads
<br>
that they don't work.
<br>
<p>So which is it?  Do you think disabled persons with a
<br>
hereditary defect should be allowed to procreate?
<br>
To obtain clones (when it's perfected)?
