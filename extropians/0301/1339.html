<em>&gt; &quot;So far Bush is doing a very poor job convincing anybody that he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally right in attacking Irak. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that Sadam is a murderous racist tyrant despotic dictator is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral justification enough.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This whole thing would be far more credible, if the US had shown or would
<br>
show real interest in the well-being of other countries. It is not very
<br>
convincing, when someone deals with non-democratic regimes (Chile,
<br>
Argentina, Nicaragua, Iran, Iraq) and groups like the Taliban and bin Ladin
<br>
on the one hand, and suddenly demands to be the moral leader against just
<br>
one other non-democratic regime, especially when exactly this regime had
<br>
been financially supported for years.&quot;
<br>
<p>In this instance we have a murderous racist US and west freedom hating
<br>
tyrant, and yet the US government can STILL not drum up enough popular
<br>
support to oust him without much criticism, and ironically enough, some of
<br>
that is because comments like yours above, which essentially are saying
<br>
&quot;This war is not morally just because other wars which are less morally just
<br>
were not undertaken, therefore I will not support this one&quot;  Which is of
<br>
course ridiculous.  In this case a clear and present threat exists, and yet
<br>
many people still don't support it.  How would the US get popular support
<br>
behind attacking a regime that is not considered a clear and present threat?
<br>
I am all for ousting the non-democratic despotic regimes all over the world,
<br>
bring all humans into constitutional democratic republics and all the world
<br>
will benefit. 
<br>
<p>But try to convince that goal to post-colonialist post-modern multicultural
<br>
relativist liberals and see where it gets you.  Accustations of forcing our
<br>
crazy cultural ideals like free speech, equal rights, and individual and
<br>
civil liberties on these other cultures.  Which means we leave them to rot
<br>
in oppresion, sexism, and tyranny in the name of 'respecting other cultures'
<br>
<p>&quot;Even if Iraq has to be liberated from Saddam tyranny, that task is much
<br>
more complicated than just a military action game. The problem will be to
<br>
esablish a stable, democratic system, that will honor human rights.
<br>
Unfortunately, this is an idea, which is completely new in that region and
<br>
has no roots there.&quot;
<br>
<p>Right, it is an ideal.  So because it will be tough we shouldn't even try?
<br>
We could try putting political pressure on saddam, get the UN inspectors in,
<br>
or try an embargo, wait, we allready did all those things.  So what should
<br>
we do, just *hope* he doesn't have or use any weapons of mass destruction?
<br>
I have yet to see any viable alternative course of action presented by the
<br>
'anti war' groups.  Id be willing to listen of course.    
<br>
<p>&quot;And even worse: the US has no interest in such a development.&quot;
<br>
<p>And you know this howwwww....?  Creating a democratic free arab nation over
<br>
one of the largest sources of oil in the world will have profound benefits
<br>
to the US.  Not only would it undermine the OPEC oil price fixing, it would
<br>
help to elimate the money Saudi's use to fund terrorists, and create an
<br>
example to the Arab world of what a democratic free market embracing arab
<br>
nation could be like.  This would help to combat many west hating
<br>
idealogies.
<br>
<p>&quot;So what? What do you think can he possibly do with that oil? Does he have
<br>
any chance to make any money with it? Could he smuggle substancial amounts
<br>
of it out of the country? How? And who would pay for it?&quot;
<br>
<p>You are right of course, he is completely unable to sell any oil to anyone,
<br>
nor use it to power his own military industrial base.
<br>
<p>&quot;The US government pays 10-20 times its yearly amount of developing aid for
<br>
a war against a country with the worlds second largest 
<br>
depository of the most important energy resource. It takes the risk of
<br>
starting a wildfire of violence in that region. &quot;
<br>
<p>It also takes the risk of creating a shinning becon of democracy in an Arab
<br>
sea of tryanny, corruption, oppression, and murder.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Would you believe, that this regime, with &quot;US interests first&quot; as its prime
<br>
directive, will implement a truly free and democratic political 
<br>
system in Iraq, that will use the oil resources for the benefit of the Iraqi
<br>
people?&quot;
<br>
<p>A democratic, free, and market based nation with free arabs selling the oil
<br>
to us will benefit us and them more than any other arrangement.  It will
<br>
increase their wealth rapidly, still give us cheap oil, and create an
<br>
example of a free democratic arab nation in the face of the theocratic
<br>
murderous regimes that surround them.  
<br>
<p>&quot;What if the new regime in Bagdad plays well with the other OPEC states?&quot;
<br>
<p>What if we are successful in ousting saddam, with minimal loss of civilian
<br>
lives (or non) set up a free democratic constituional republic, and create a
<br>
great example of western democracy in a wealthy arab country, and get
<br>
ourselves cheap oil in the process?
