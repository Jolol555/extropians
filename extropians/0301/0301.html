<em>&gt; &gt; Samantha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   Look at what is being said.  &quot;I served my country as a security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence reconnaissance expert for black agencies that don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officially exist.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        Now that says that congress didn't approve of the &quot;black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agency&quot; nor did they authorize money to be spent on it.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They do not know of its existance and cannot exercise their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constitutional duty of oversight.
</em><br>
<p>THis is inaccurate. There have been a number of agencies and projects
<br>
which did not officially exist with respect to the public but were
<br>
under the oversight of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees
<br>
from their inception. The CIA, NSA, NRO all at one time 'didn't exist'
<br>
as far as the public was concerned. The B-2 and F-117, the U-2 and
<br>
SR-71, the Corona, Lacrosse, and other weapons systems programs 'didn't
<br>
exist' long after they were operational projects.
<br>
<p>Why is this allowed? Because when an open society has totalitarian
<br>
enemies, their best sources of intelligence on open societies' defenses
<br>
is those societies own free press and other open media sources. During
<br>
the Cold War, a large fraction of the USSR's intelligence budget was
<br>
comprised of subscriptions to western publications, everything from the
<br>
NY Times to Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology (known in our own Defense
<br>
establishment as &quot;Aviation Leak&quot;).
<br>
<p>The whole Roswell/UFO/Area 51 deal was a disinformation campaign to
<br>
distract Soviet agents from gaining intelligence on our various
<br>
development programs based in Nevada.
