<em>&gt; &gt; Seems &quot;the world&quot; is still awaiting proof on two propositions :

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Notable, in the Clonaid case, is that around 11 days have passed
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence....
</em><br>
<p>Completely agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, if the Church of Government were intent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inquisitioning you for acting on such science (as was done 500
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years ago in another science that challenged the powers that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be), you'd be circumspect about offering up proof of your guilt.
</em><br>
<p>Also completely agree.
<br>
<p>In my post &quot;Calling Cloniad's bluff with PCR, pubic hair and 
<br>
placental tissue&quot;. I offered a possible way by which Clonaid might
<br>
prove the existence of a clone WITHOUT having to identify the
<br>
parent. Perhaps not this time but next time when they have another
<br>
placenta.
<br>
<p>I suggested that the placenta (which would only be available to
<br>
Clonaid) in the case of a birth (and which could be used to collect
<br>
DNA from) as well as some tissue that would only occur in the 
<br>
state of a mature individual (I suggested pubic hair) could be sent
<br>
to a lab. If the same DNA is in both tissue samples from two clearly
<br>
different aged individuals (babies don't have pubic hair) then that
<br>
would look like pretty good proof of existence, so far as I can see,
<br>
and there would be *no need* to expose the parent to the govt
<br>
at all, she could stay anonymous.
<br>
<p>As it turns out though, pubic hair may not be sufficiently different
<br>
from other types of body hair (according to a guy I rang at the 
<br>
state forensic pathology lab). Some other age specific tissue might
<br>
be possible. A large thumb or toe nail clipping, ie. too large to come
<br>
from and infant might work. Perhaps even if the mother has very 
<br>
long hair (too long for an infant) that might work.
<br>
<p>I'd like to put this proposition to Clonaid to get them to put up or
<br>
shut up as the press they are generating seems likely to harm the 
<br>
stem cell debate. It Michael Shermer of the Skeptics feeling now
<br>
that it is almost certainly a hoax and I agree. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Meanwhile despite having 25,000 US troops in the Gulf and another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 75,000 on the way, despite Britain and now apparently France
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preparing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to send troops as well, the weapons inspectors have still not found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any evidence of WMD, no evidence (at least that I have heard of) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has been presented linking Hussein to terrorist acts since the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gulf war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ditto on rules of evidence as above. 
</em><br>
<p>Again agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is in fact evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concealment in that significant quantities of chemical and biotoxins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known to be in inventory in 1998 are not accounted for in Iraq's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most recent Declaration to the Security Council. They have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappeared from the tally, and Iraq refuses to disclose what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened to them.
</em><br>
<p>I did hear something about that. That is suggestive but not
<br>
conclusive imo. What is the shelf life of the particular chemicals and
<br>
&nbsp;biotoxins I wonder? Would they not have degraded? Still the paper
<br>
&nbsp;trail should be there one would think, unless some of the scientists
<br>
&nbsp;involved with the program destroyed the paper trail and the evidence
<br>
perhaps years before the current &quot;calling to account&quot;.
<br>
<p>I agree that this missing information *is* suggestive. But its not enough
<br>
imo to justify invading a sovereign country. A failure to explain what 
<br>
they did (sometime since 1998) with what they had then, doesn't 
<br>
equate to either having WMD now, or to Iraq having dealt with
<br>
terrorists since the last gulf war. I think one or both of these would
<br>
be necessary to justify invading a sovereign country. And one or both 
<br>
of these *may* yet be found. Or may have already been found and
<br>
Bush may be chosing his time to disclose what he has.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Just because someone hides something very well from you does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not mean it doesn't exist.
</em><br>
<p>True. But alleging something exists and then failing to find it or show
<br>
that one has found it doesn't prove it exists to others either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If your ability to discover it is entirely dependent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon their cooperation and disclosure, when they are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in doing so, then you will never find what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  looking for.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But surely it is not *entirely* dependent upon cooperation. Spy 
<br>
satelights, spy's, informants, members of Saddams inner sanctum
<br>
who can read the writing on the wall and want to escape going
<br>
down with him. There are lots of sources of info Bush may have,
<br>
some of which may be too unsavory to tell the sensitive public
<br>
about. Particularlty given the sensitivity in some quarters about
<br>
where the bio-material for some of the weapons Hussein had came
<br>
from before.  I don't think Rumsfeld or anyone else close to the
<br>
President wants to be seen getting info on Iraq from the next
<br>
batch of unsavvory characters. But I don't doubt they'll take what
<br>
ever evidence they can get, and present it at a time a place of 
<br>
their choosing, not the UNs, and not Saddam's. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems that a whole lot of people are getting dressed up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who are going to be very disappointed to have no place to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think they are not going anywhere, you are mistaken.
</em><br>
<p>I did go into more detail as to why in my reply to Charles Hixon.
<br>
But suffice to say I regard it as almost 100% certain now that they
<br>
are going to invade Iraq. Imo, politically, Bush has no other 
<br>
effective choice now. I think that he would loose the next 
<br>
Presidential election if he did not invade Iraq. That doesn't 
<br>
mean that an invasion is justified imo though. Imo the case for an
<br>
invasion has still to be made.
