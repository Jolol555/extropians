<p>Living Tissue to Be Hot Off the Printer
<br>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists are turning to desktop printers in an
<br>
effort to produce three-dimensional tubes of living tissue and possibly
<br>
even entire organs.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Instead of using a degradable scaffold and covering it with cells to
<br>
produce tissue, scientists in the United States are modifying ink jet
<br>
printers and using cells to create 3D structures. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The work is a first step toward printing complex tissues or even entire
<br>
organs,&quot; New Scientist magazine said on Wednesday. 
<br>
<p>Although producing organs is a very long way away, many laboratories are
<br>
printing arrays of DNA, proteins and even cells. 
<br>
<p>Vladimir Mironov of the Medical University of South Carolina and Thomas
<br>
Boland of Clemson University in the same state have used a non-toxic,
<br>
biodegradable gel and animal cells to make the structures. 
<br>
<p>&quot;By printing alternate layers of the gel and clumps of cells on to glass
<br>
slides, they have shown 3D structures such as tubes can be built,&quot;
<br>
according to the magazine. 
<br>
<p>If the layers are thin enough the cells fuse when they come in contact
<br>
with each other and bits of tissue are formed. When the structure is
<br>
finished the gel can be removed. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Like printing with different colors, placing different types of cells
<br>
in the ink cartridges should make it possible to recreate complex
<br>
structures consisting of multiple cells,&quot; the magazine explained. 
<br>
<p>But before scientists can produce organs they will have to solve the
<br>
problem of creating circulatory networks to provide oxygen and nutrients
<br>
to the cells in the structures. 
<br>
<p>But the scientists hope it will be possible. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This could have the same kind of impact that Gutenberg's press did,&quot;
<br>
said Mironov.
