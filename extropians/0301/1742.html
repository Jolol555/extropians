If that's the incident that I'm remembering, there were disputes about 
<br>
territorial waters, and where the boundaries were.  (We didn't agree 
<br>
that they had the right to put the boundaries where they said they 
<br>
did.)  So it isn't exactly unprovoked.  Also (again if it's the incident 
<br>
that I'm remembering) the ship was there in (indirect) support of 
<br>
Israel.  I don't remember if they were officially at war or not, but 
<br>
they certainly weren't friendly.
<br>
<p>FWIW, when Israel bombed Baghdad they weren't officially at war.  But 
<br>
Israel claimed that nuclear weapons were being made.
<br>
<p>What do I think we should do?
<br>
Well, I certainly don't like a military invasion.  How about a $100,000 
<br>
bounty for the head and right hand of anyone who can be proved to be 
<br>
either a tax collector or an administrator (or manager) of the Iraqi 
<br>
government?  That should stop them pretty quickly.  (Perhaps pay an 
<br>
equal defection bonus?  Is that enough that they could find some other 
<br>
country to accept them?)
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'm being too chintzy.  Given the prices of weapons these days 
<br>
(and the difficulty of establishing proof) it might be cost effective to 
<br>
double it to $200,000.
