<p><em>&gt;        Let me give you an example -- it is not unheard of for Congress to

</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that I would give the congresscriters that much credit.
<br>
It might be right in some of the cases but I'm reminded of an old story
<br>
of Sen. Bob Packwood's before he slipped on his self-created banana peel.
<br>
Apparently the Sen. agricultural committee had worked long and hard trying
<br>
to craft an agricultural bill that would cost the U.S. Gov. no more than
<br>
$10B in subsidies.  No more than a few years after the bill was passed
<br>
the farmers had figured out how to fix their crop plantings such that
<br>
the bill was costing the gov. $40B/yr.  Moral of the story: many motivated
<br>
minds trump fewer less motivated minds (who might think they are &quot;smarter&quot;).
<br>
<p>You may be right that there is some complex swap-in/swap-out of loop holes.
<br>
I'd be more inclined to write much of it off to a lack of foresight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it does seem clear that it will help the 401K plans.  It also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears he is trying to  attract some of the manufacturing that has gone out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the country to come back.  If so he has a long way to go.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  The question of whether it will help/hurt 401K plans and/or
<br>
investment accounts seems complex.

<p>(the second of which I think I posted previously.)
<br>
<p>[If you don't want to read these now, at least grab them and save them
<br>
because within a few weeks the NY Times will likely turn them into pay-per-view.]
<br>
<p>My read of the whole affair is that it really changes the investment
<br>
playing field.  CEO's and boards are going to have to decide whether
<br>
they want to cultivate groups that don't benefit from dividend tax relief
<br>
(i.e. they remain in the old paradigm of tax reduction, going offshore, etc.)
<br>
or whether they want to shift into the paradigm of delivering a relatively
<br>
guaranteed tax free return to their investors on an annual basis.
<br>
<p>It is *very* complex.
