<p><em>&gt; As a law student he [Robert L. Humphreys} got interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the field of &quot;Natural Rights&quot; or &quot;Natural Law.&quot;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe one proceeds from the other.  As a peace maker he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt there was one natural law that was absolutely universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and vital -- break it and you have the beginning of conflict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He said we must always remember that the poorest most down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trodden person in the world loves their spouse (&amp; children)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much as we do and is as interested in seeing those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dear ones happy &amp; successful -- natural law number one.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how this &quot;natural law number one&quot;, which pulls
<br>
sympathy from us in favor of the poor, is of any more use
<br>
to those of us who treasure personal and economic freedom
<br>
than it would be to cradle-to-grave communists who would
<br>
want to use state power to *ensure* that the &quot;poorest most
<br>
down-trodden&quot; get what is &quot;fair&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...However I have to ask this.  If we do not recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural law and natural rights then why do we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; republic or try to place restraints on a government as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to what it can or can or cannot do to its citizenry?
</em><br>
<p>Well, as partial answer had I been alive in 1776 (in
<br>
hindsight, of course, being aware of the real works of
<br>
people like Jefferson who really were alive at
<br>
the time), I would have written as follows:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good and proper for men to be free, to pay no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respects to any King, to go about their own business
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unmolested, and to worship or not in whatever manner
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they wish.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the greatest benefit &amp; prosperity will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accrue to all if the above sensible liberties are secured
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by law.  It is the King's ministers and minions that now
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repress our trade, diminish our fortunes, and infringe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon our freedom as individuals.  Noxious and peculiar
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laws must nevermore oppress our nation and our people.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are near two million strong, and have no need of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King's redcoats, and can deal ourselves with the heathen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if need be.  And on like score, we can have our own navy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when other nations attempt to intercede against us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, of course, all this be only my opinion, it is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simply not granted to any man anything further.
<br>
<p>So, see, I could have argued just as well in favor of your
<br>
&quot;restraints on government&quot;.  The above seems true and logical
<br>
to me.  We (a) want our rights, and (b) it works great for
<br>
all if we have them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we restrain governments because we intuitively feel there are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural laws and natural rights -- that it is wrong for a government to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violate those laws.  If we do not believe this then why is it wrong for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutional democracy to change its constitution to remove all restraints 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then treat its minorities as it wishes?
</em><br>
<p>Because it is (and was) evident to democrats everywhere
<br>
(e.g. Holland) that trade and prosperity are maximized
<br>
when the government butts out.  Talk to any businessman
<br>
even today, and the story is the same as it has been for
<br>
centuries.  His biggest problems (except for competitors,
<br>
of course) are regulations and the government.
<br>
<p>I think that it is from the business community that most
<br>
of the impetus for freedom historically arose.  Now, partly,
<br>
this was because it *worked*:  It should have been obvious
<br>
to everyone that the government's only two wealth-producing
<br>
roles are to defend a nation from outside aggression, and to
<br>
enforce contracts and protection of private property, and
<br>
that the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; (1776 by A. Smith) arose in
<br>
deference to these notions, and that countries less free
<br>
were the poorer for it.  England and the Netherlands were
<br>
fine examples already.
<br>
<p>So, &quot;intuitively&quot; I don't feel the presence of any natural
<br>
laws (outside physics).  I guess I never have.
<br>
<p>Lee
