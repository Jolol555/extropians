Here's my newspaper review of Pinker's book, published (under some
<br>
sub-editor's witless header `Natural-born Fellows') in the Weekend
<br>
Australian for a general audience:
<br>
<p>The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature
<br>
By Steven Pinker, Allen Lane, 509pp, $A 29.95
<br>
<p><p>As a Catholic brat, I learned that humans share a corrupted nature, spoiled
<br>
by the sin of Adam but salvaged by our Creator in a startling act of
<br>
self-sacrifice. Despite redemption, that fatal, tragic condition of original
<br>
sin left us prey to wickedness, always liable to slip off the narrow path
<br>
into theft, lies, betrayal, sensuality. Let your human nature run free, and
<br>
you'd wind up burning in Hell.
<br>
During the hopeful 1960s, many rejected that gloomy doctrine. What if there
<br>
were no fixed human nature after all? What if we are born as a blank slate
<br>
with no text inscribed on it, no instincts or bents, only endless
<br>
opportunity for making ourselves? Then we might painfully develop more
<br>
humane and creative modes of living, casting off racism, sexism, jealousy
<br>
and material envy, the prejudices and bad habits of a cruelly deprived
<br>
history: call it the Fabian theory of improvement. &quot;Wadda we want?&quot; &quot;Gradual
<br>
change!&quot; &quot;Wenna we want it?&quot; &quot;In due course!&quot;
<br>
Or maybe, delirious thought, it might come in a thunderclap of revolution,
<br>
violent if need be or fueled by sweet magic insight. Either way, it seemed
<br>
pretty certain that &quot;human nature&quot; was an ideological fossil from grimmer
<br>
eras when people had been conditioned to distrust the body and each other.
<br>
If that was the wistful hope of the young Boomers, it faded and chipped
<br>
badly as the years passed. Insurrections guttered. Vietnam threw out the
<br>
Americans, then rediscovered capitalism. The old Soviet Union turned to God.
<br>
Meanwhile, nature made a big comeback. The Boomers' kids, when they weren't
<br>
plotting their next takeover, worshiped Gaia, ate natural foods, rejected
<br>
synthetic medicines for natural remedies. This was Nature, but not the old
<br>
Adam; Nature was a goddess of purity, and all we needed to do was find her
<br>
within ourselves. Ideology switched again: if it's natural, it must be good.
<br>
If it's bad, that must be the fault of wrong words, calculation rather than
<br>
spontaneity, people playing god and setting themselves above nature.
<br>
Meanwhile, science was looking again at what human nature might actually
<br>
be. Humans are evolved critters, and just as we have opposed thumbs for
<br>
grasping, maybe we inherit templates for action as well. Speech, for
<br>
example: without specialised areas in the brain, pre-shaped to acquire words
<br>
and fit them to the outside world, we'd never learnt to talk. Could we also
<br>
inherit predispositions to behave in certain ways under certain conditions?
<br>
Every other animal does. But that's a terrifying suggestion to a culture
<br>
when &quot;nature&quot; now equals &quot;wholesome&quot;. If ordinary men can find it within
<br>
themselves to rape women under brutal conditions of war and lawlessness,
<br>
that would imply rape is &quot;natural&quot; and we'd have to accept it!
<br>
The error should be obvious. Salmonella is also part of nature, but we work
<br>
hard to prevent it making us sick. Actually, if we do have a complex human
<br>
nature, we'll only contain its nastier aspects by facing them fearlessly.
<br>
The rediscovery of a persistent and universal human nature forged by our
<br>
Darwinian history is detailed in Steven Pinker's ample, readable new book.
<br>
His sensitive investigation of rape, and of other &quot;don't-go-there&quot; topics,
<br>
is exemplary and brave.
<br>
Linguistic psychologist Pinker's earlier excellent popularisations, The
<br>
Language Instinct and How the Mind Works, covered findings in evolutionary
<br>
and cognitive science, game theory, etc. Controversially, he renews these
<br>
themes while drawing on his polymathic knowledge to propose ways communities
<br>
might balance private and public virtues and failings. What he dubs the
<br>
Utopian Left will resent and deplore his claim that &quot;the new sciences of
<br>
human nature really do resonate with assumptions that historically were
<br>
closer to the right than to the left&quot; (since genes build individuals, not
<br>
societies, even if those individuals are social beings), but the Tragic
<br>
Right will also be discomfited.
<br>
Should people be free to spend their own money, not have it seized away by
<br>
tax authorities? Not so fast: &quot;economists repeatedly find that people spend
<br>
their money like drunken sailors&quot;. Why? Original sin? Stupidity? No, because
<br>
the mental planners in our brains evolved in a dangerous ancestral
<br>
environment where you were likely to die young, so you might as well live
<br>
for the day. Libertarians will be surprised, too, by his account of the
<br>
merits of a state, and of a more egalitarian income distribution. We share
<br>
behavioral templates that provoke bloody escalating contests of honour in
<br>
the absence of mediating, somewhat neutral, adjudicators. And crime rates
<br>
are higher in regions of great income disparity because, for evolutionary
<br>
reasons, &quot;chronic low status leads men to become obsessed with rank and kill
<br>
each other over trivial insults&quot;. So it is prudent, as well as humane, not
<br>
to make the poorest feel like worthless dogs. (Forget the fabled peaceful
<br>
traditional indigenes, though: in such cultures, between 10 and 60 percent
<br>
of men die by violence.) Those on the left, meanwhile, might learn something
<br>
unsettling from Pinker's account of why he follows Noam Chomsky in
<br>
linguistics but not in politics.
<br>
An extraordinarily fertile book: highly recommended.
