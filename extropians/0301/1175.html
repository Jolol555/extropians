<p>Samantha, I am still curious as to what you thought of the Korean War, and
<br>
whether it was 'senseless' in the manner you felt the Vietnam war was.  And
<br>
if it was (or wasn't) I would wonder what differences you saw between the
<br>
Korean War and the Vietnam war exactly that might make you consider one
<br>
senseless yet not the other, or both senseless.
<br>

<p>&quot;It was a senseless war from the beginning fought in a truly senseless and
<br>
horrific way.  It doesn't take a great deal of analysis to smell the napalm
<br>
or count the number of friends and friends and friends of friends who came
<br>
home in body bags or with minds and bodies 
<br>
twisted and mutilated out of shape or to note that the &quot;for what&quot; was highly
<br>
speculative and ill-defined at best.  The &quot;international position of the
<br>
United States&quot; is laughable when it bankrupts the country for such a
<br>
senseless exercise.  We the people do precisely what we are supposed to do
<br>
when we notice such or notice such brewing again and say &quot;HELL NO&quot;.&quot;
<br>
<p>Samantha, I presume you are still referring to the Vietnam war with this
<br>
statement.  I am curious if you consider the Korean war an equally
<br>
'senselless' endeavor, and if not, what do you consider the differences
<br>
between these two situations.  The arguments from the right contend that
<br>
these situations are nearly identical, in both cases a communist nation was
<br>
receiving heavy support in the form of weapons and supplies from parent
<br>
states (both the soviet union and China in both cases), and in both cases
<br>
americans were asked to go to a far off country to fight for people and a
<br>
culture they barely knew for politically unstable governments that were
<br>
fighting the aggressive invasion efforts of known communist despotic
<br>
regimes, in both cases poor military decisions were made and in both cases
<br>
there were heavy civilian and military causalties.  Yet in Korea 'We' won,
<br>
and now South Korea has one of the most succefull and prosperous economies
<br>
in the world, while the description of North Korea's current state I'll
<br>
leave to Liberal author Christopher Hutchins...
<br>
<p>&quot;All films, all books, all newspapers and all radio and television
<br>
broadcasts are about either the Father or the Son[Kim Jong Il]. Everybody is
<br>
a soldier. Everybody is an informer. Everybody is a unit. Everything is
<br>
propaganda...Children are drilled to think of Japanese and Americans, in
<br>
particular, as monstrous...The old justification for the Stalinist
<br>
forced-march system was that at least it led to development. But even in
<br>
Pyongyang, the capital city which is reserved for approved citizens, one can
<br>
see that this excuse doesn't work. Neither does anything else; the place is
<br>
stalled and hungry and subject to constant blackouts. There are no cars on
<br>
the streets; there is no construction except of tawdry shrines to the Holy
<br>
Family. A very small window of dollar bribery has opened up in recent years,
<br>
but there's nothing to buy and no black market. Corruption at the leadership
<br>
level is exorbitant, with palaces and limos and (a special obsession of Kim
<br>
Jong Il's) megalomaniacal movie projects...I saw people scavenging
<br>
individual grains from the fields and washing themselves in open sewers. On
<br>
the almost deserted roads, animals do a good deal of the hauling. Domestic
<br>
pets are nowhere to be seen. Perhaps most have been eaten, for the fact is
<br>
that North Korea is a famine stat...Nobody knows the death toll-the best
<br>
guess is between 1.5 and 2 million-but in addition a generation of
<br>
physically and mentally stunted children has been &quot;fathered&quot; by the &quot;Dear
<br>
Leader.&quot; Well-attested rumors of cannibalism have filtered across the border
<br>
to China, where a Korean-speaking minority has lately been augmented by
<br>
refugees so desperate that they will risk shooting in order to brave the
<br>
river. A system where you can't live but you can't leave is the definition
<br>
of hell...deserted towns, empty factories, wandering and neglected children
<br>
and untilled fields...the country's once productive coal mines have been
<br>
allowed to flood, and that there are no pumps that can be brought to bear&quot;
<br>

<p>Had 'we' lost this conflict, all the people of south korea would be living
<br>
under this same horific nighmarish regime.  Take a moment to think about
<br>
what life in North Korea is actually like.  
<br>
<p>Now compare this with Vietnam, during the vietnam war the anti-war
<br>
protestors gained a majority public support for a variety of reasons, namely
<br>
the shocking realization of what war is actually like due to the first time
<br>
presence of journalists in the field, coupled with idealogical promulgation
<br>
of preconcieved ideas in the face of contradictory evidence, and wide
<br>
support of Ho Chi Minh and the communist north from public figures,
<br>
celebrities, and academics.  Eventually 'they' won out, and the US abandoned
<br>
the Indochina region.  In the few months following the US withdrawel from
<br>
Indochina, more than a million south vietnamese were killed, and then spread
<br>
to cambodia, where arguable the worst holocaust in the worlds history took
<br>
place, taking the lives of an additional 3 million cambodians.  
<br>
<p>All throughout this conflict the war proponents predicted these events and
<br>
warned of them, and sadly they were right.  So what of this effort do you
<br>
find 'senseless' exactly?  Do you think the situation would have turned out
<br>
similar had 'we' (The US and South Vietnam) won and South Vietnam continued
<br>
to exist as an independent state, set up a market economy, and prospered,
<br>
just as South Korea has?  The lives of some 4 - 5 million residents of the
<br>
Indochina region would in all likelyhood have been spared from the
<br>
slaughter, oppression, and enslavement that they had been forced to endure.

<p>Sisowath Sirik Matak was a high ranking official in the Khmer (Cambodian)
<br>
Republic, 1970-75. Two weeks before the fall of Phnom Penh, the capital of
<br>
Cambodia, to the communist Khmer Rouge, US Ambassador to Cambodia John
<br>
Gunther Dean offered the Premier safe passage to the United States. The
<br>
letter below is Sisowath's reply:  
<br>
<p>Dear Excellency and Friend
<br>
<p>I thank you sincerely for your letter and for your offer to transport me
<br>
toward freedom. I cannot, alas, leave in such a cowardly fashion. As for
<br>
you, and in particular your great country, I never believed for a moment
<br>
that you would have this sentiment of abandoning a people which has chosen
<br>
liberty. You have refused us your protection, and we can do nothing about
<br>
it. 
<br>
<p>You leave and my wish is that you and your country will find happiness under
<br>
this sky. But mark it well, that if I shall die here on the spot and in the
<br>
country I love, it is too bad, because we are all born and must die one day.
<br>
I have only committed this mistake of believing in you.
<br>
<p>Sisowath Sirik Matak 
<br>
<p>Sisowath Sirik Matak was executed less than a week after the fall of Phnom
<br>
Penh.
