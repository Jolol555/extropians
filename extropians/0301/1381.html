Sorry for interrupting the flaming, but I feel a need to defend the 
<br>
honor of Niccolo Machiavelli.

<p>Hmm, you have not read much of him, have you? While his name have become
<br>
synonymous with ruthless realpolitik, he was actually an idealist
<br>
seeking to create a free, united and (for its time) democratic Italy. 
<br>
<p>_The Prince_ was an attempt to write a HOWTO-manual for rulers, showing
<br>
what methods had worked and not worked in the past and explanations of
<br>
why. For its time it was an amazing document, since it attempted to
<br>
distinguish political science as the study of what people do or can do
<br>
from the study of what they *ought* to do - all previous books in the
<br>
genre were essentially sermons about being a nice just ruler. It is very
<br>
much a renaissance document, laying some of the dirty groundwork for the
<br>
enlightenment and the start of political science. 
<br>
<p>In his _Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livius_ (1513-21),
<br>
often called _The Republic_ he looked at republics and what made *them*
<br>
work. In &quot;Discourses&quot; he emphasized that for a republic to survive, it
<br>
needed to foster a spirit of patriotism and civic virtue among its
<br>
citizens. Machiavelli argued that a republic would be strengthened by
<br>
the conflicts generated through open political participation and debate. 
<br>
See the direct influence on liberal and dynamist thinking? 
<br>
<p>Machiavelli didn't talk about human rights, because they were not part
<br>
of the discourse yet (while the Sophists had discussed natural rights
<br>
and Christianity had a rights idea based on being in God's image neither
<br>
really applied to things like freedom). Blaming him for ruthless 
<br>
politicians is a misattribution - they existed long before and 
<br>
independently of his thinking. Many of his political views doesn't 
<br>
resonate well these days (I doubt he ever thought about women playing a 
<br>
role in the republic), but we shouldn't get trapped in historicism. He 
<br>
was an important step forward, and I actually prefer the politician who 
<br>
has read his books (*all of them*) to somebody who proudly declares 
<br>
himself to be anti-Machiavellian.
