<p><em>    &gt;With no or little consequences and death to only him and his
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;direct guard and troops that *might* be enough.
</em><br>
<p>Well thanks a bunch for that concession, but only *might* ??
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; He hasn't been able to do much of squat with that oil for the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; last decade in case you missed it.
</em><br>
<p>That's true and due entirely to the 91 gulf war. I bet you opposed that
<br>
conflict too.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;There are many murderous  despotic tyrants in the world.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Why do we go after this one in  particular
</em><br>
<p>Because Saddam is the only tyrant on this planet that invaded his neighbors
<br>
twice,
<br>
is developing weapons of mass destruction and has actually used them, and
<br>
most
<br>
important of all looks like it's practical to overthrow militarily.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Are you sure oil and positioning US  forces don't have at least
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;something to do with it?
</em><br>
<p>Iraq has the second largest and possibly the largest oil reserve in the
<br>
world, of course that has something to due with it. But it doesn't matter
<br>
a hoot in hell if the reasons America wants to go to war are saintly or
<br>
sinful, the important thing is the consequences of doing so. Will getting
<br>
rid of Saddam be a good thing? Yes. Is the price to do that too high?
<br>
I don't know. I worry about the war itself and I worry about the
<br>
occupation. I just hope the Bush people know what they're doing.
