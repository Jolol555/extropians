<p>[General comment: I've already replied to some of these point in my

<br>
<p>&quot;The above&quot; isn't visible here its in the other post. Where I denied
<br>
assuming reason is sufficient for all things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is also the matter of a more inductive approach to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain questions of life and value.  For that matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the entire sphere of values is not easily reduced to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which reason alone recommends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hear, hear!  IMO, reason is completely incapable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishing values---reason can do no more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explore the consistency of values.
</em><br>
<p>Reason can certainly do the consistency testing, as you so often
<br>
demonstate so well. 
<br>
<p>I wonder though if reason can't establish some values too.
<br>
I'll have to chew that over. 
<br>
<p>Hmm. Seems to me that our only existant knowledge of reasoning
<br>
beasts to date is ourselves and we have clearly emerged in a social
<br>
context and language it would seem probably came along after 
<br>
reasoning.
<br>
<p>But then, chimps can do reasoning of a form, they can use tools to
<br>
reach for fruit, even tools to reach for tools to reach for fruit. And
<br>
they don't have language as we normally mean it. So it looks like
<br>
reason predates language. Now all I need to show is that language
<br>
gives rise to some value that was not around prior to language. But
<br>
hang on. I *value* language itself quite highly, it would certainly make
<br>
my life harder and my standard of living and social interactions less 
<br>
rich were I not to have it. If language requires reason that it seems 
<br>
reason does create values. A whole swag of values perhaps.
<br>
<p>Did a small light just come on somewhere or is this jumped up 
<br>
chimp (me) just scratching his head too hard?R.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even in values, it is unwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say &quot;Blah, blah blah, and blah.  This is what I BELIEVE!&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g., &quot;It is horrible and obscene and cruel and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WRONG for a woman to cut the arms off her daughter, and THIS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IS WHAT I BELIEVE&quot;, completely shutting oneself down to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical inquiry and pursuit of consistency.
</em><br>
<p>Hooray! Welcome back Lee, I missed you ;-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
