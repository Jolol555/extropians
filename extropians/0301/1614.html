<em>&gt; &gt; danger of sticking  their neck out too far and becoming actionable

<em>&gt; &gt; under defamation (libel) law.  Probably not. They probably
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance the Aussie defamation laws might have  gone out on a limb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of their own too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laws against defamation and libel are something I know very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little about.  Why do they need to exist?
</em><br>
<p>In a nutshell, because people rely on their reputations for their
<br>
livelihood.
<br>
<p>Particularly after newspapers became more widespread it was found that
<br>
defamatory statements (its libel if its in print and slander if its verbal
<br>
but
<br>
both are forms of defamation) could do a lot of damage to reputations
<br>
that was not easily undone. In some cases think about accusations of
<br>
dishonest behaviour in business or accusations of child abuse for instance
<br>
the charges are serious enough for people hearing them even if they are
<br>
not proven to effect how people hearing them may treat the person who
<br>
is defamed.
<br>
<p>Defamation has always been of particular interest to newspapers which
<br>
bring the opportunity to do some wholesale defaming. And there is
<br>
historical tension between free speech and defamation. In some legal
<br>
jurisdictions truth is a complete defence to defamation in others its not
<br>
enough for the charge to be true journalists for instance may also have
<br>
to show that making the charge publicly was in the public interest. A sort
<br>
of the-punishment-should-fit-the-crime argument. I.e. The public is deemed
<br>
to have a legal right to know that which is genuinely in its interest but
<br>
not just
<br>
that which would merely titillate or amuse. Members of society that
<br>
are deemed to be in the public life, like politicians etc are often afforded
<br>
some different standard. It can be harder to bring a defamation suit if one
<br>
is
<br>
in the public life, yet as many that are in the public life have legal
<br>
backgrounds
<br>
and know how to protect themselves MP's are frequent users of defamation
<br>
laws. In Australia Parliamentary privilege means MP's can say things in the
<br>
parliament without fear of being sued for defamation and its not uncommon
<br>
for Parliamentarians who feel that parliamentary privilege (intended to make
<br>
for better more accountable government) to challenge each other to make
<br>
the same remarks outside - where they'd be actionable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clearly if someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writes anything untrue about someone else, suit may be brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at least in the U.S.) with a fair chance of success.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more is really needed anyway?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what the situation is in the US, but as a country that
<br>
derives its law from the English tradition it is likely to be pretty similar
<br>
to
<br>
Australia and the UK.
<br>
<p>I think in Australia there are aspects of defamation law that are covered
<br>
by statute and to breach them is a crime and there are other aspects that
<br>
are covered only by common law under the law of torts or civil wrongs.
<br>
I'm guessing a bit but suspect the same would be the case in the US. The
<br>
statute-y stuff would probably be aimed at putting some sensibly limits on
<br>
the general freedom of the press in the public interest. The common law
<br>
stuff, where you could talk of bringing a suit against someone probably is
<br>
a common law suit where the tort is defamation.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if you are implying that there are other sorts of law suit that
<br>
people can bring in a common law context that are not called defamation
<br>
but be successfully pursued simply on the basis of what has been said not
<br>
being true. Its possible, there are things like fraud and misrepresentation
<br>
which involve untruth.
<br>
<p>As a rough sort of model. Freedom of speech is unrestrained except where
<br>
its defamatory. The claim of defamation requires a defence (the onus is on
<br>
the one accused of defaming to show there were grounds). In some cases
<br>
truth is a complete defence and in others truth alone is not sufficient
<br>
defence
<br>
to the charge of defamation their may need to be a higher public interest
<br>
than mere titillation or amusement for instance.
<br>
<p>Whilst defamation laws can if caste too widely hurt free speech I think they
<br>
are a legitimate part of civil society in that it I think it really is true
<br>
that
<br>
society as a whole benefits from having some remedy against the circumstance
<br>
where ones competitors or opponents can simply undermine ones reputation
<br>
by saying something untrue. Its much harder to undo especially printed
<br>
defamatory statements than it is to make them because its hard to know who
<br>
has been effected. Think of say a school teacher unjustly accused of child
<br>
molesting most parents would not decide the best course was to talk it over
<br>
with the teacher to make sure a good teacher wasn't blamed unfairly most
<br>
people would opt for the more economical err on the side of caution option
<br>
and simply get their child the hell out of there. That's understandable from
<br>
the parents point of view but a gross injustice if the teacher is actually
<br>
innocent and has been defamed and as a consequence can't earn her
<br>
livelihood. Same principle applies to businessmen or traders who have
<br>
their good name impacted by easily made slurs. Defamation laws don't
<br>
undo the damage done but they do partially compensate and they act as a
<br>
deterrent on the those who might otherwise defame casually and at will.
