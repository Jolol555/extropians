Mike explains
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Ron writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; These men felt that their rights were from nature and nature's God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Was that a psychological necessity for them?  If instead they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had abandoned belief in natural rights and a Divine Approval,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would they have been able to pull it off?  (You see, I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural rights to be fictitious entities, and suppose instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that only legal rights actually exist, and that these exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only in a social contract---as Charles was saying.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The enlightenment philosophers who followed the Lockean tradition (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not that or Rousseau) were primarily deists, who while believing in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creator god, felt that this entity existed outside our deterministic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe and was therefore powerless to affect or afflict it while it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was in operation.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This concept is little different from our own extropic concepts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sysops and the U-prime, Omega Point theory and our principles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spontaneous order. The idea we live in a simulation running on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum computer in some higher level universe is merely a modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rephrasing of the deist paradigm in a contemporary technological point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The deist view is essentially that Natural Law is Objective Truth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embedded in the structure and function of the universe, and exhibited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our daily lives by much more than gravity and relativistic effects,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also biological evolution and the development of intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualistic generalist organisms such as ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>This is disquieting.  Some of us, e.g. me, are great believers
<br>
in Objective Truth, and don't even mind the capitals once in a
<br>
while, like in a philosophical discussion.
<br>
<p>Oh!  It suddenly dawns on me that you are explaining what
<br>
natural laws are, as, for example, Newton's.  Well, of course
<br>
they exist!  They are objective constraints on what can happen
<br>
in our universe.  They are patterns that were here before us
<br>
and (heaven forbid) will be there after us.
<br>
<p>I don't think that that is what the &quot;natural&quot; in &quot;natural
<br>
rights&quot; is all about.
<br>
<p>Now as *rights* (which I view only as &quot;legal rights&quot;) have
<br>
very much to do with what laws a society enacts.  So there
<br>
is a natural (sorry) confusion here.  
<br>
<p>What is the difference between *natural* as used in
<br>
&quot;natural law&quot; and &quot;natural rights&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As such, there is not 'psychological necessity', Natural Law simply is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's truth is evidenced by the preeminent development of modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological societies such as the US, which is the closest physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embodiment of the enlightenment values of Locke.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course.  I was talking about there possibly being
<br>
<p>(a) a political necessity for the U.S. founders to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the term &quot;natural rights&quot;
<br>
(b) a psychological necessity for them to have faith
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in something, and this, (b), could operate either
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciously or unconsciously.
<br>
<p>Mike Butler addressed these points nicely.
