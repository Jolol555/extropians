<br>
calling for more honesty as a nation that is evident in official 
<br>
proclamations and posturings of late.  I don't see where that is in the least 
<br>
out of order.
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what your fuss is about.  The US is good enough about 
<br>
admitting its mistakes.  You may have to know where to look sometimes but for 
<br>
example I just read a really ripping analysis of our conduct in several wars. 
<br>
&nbsp;Of five battles analyzed the author tore our head off for stupidity in four 
<br>
of the battles and explained that in the one battle we won big time it was 
<br>
only because the other guy was even dumber than we were.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to know about our military errors you more or less have to 
<br>
read the military theoreticians, for our economic disasters you read the 
<br>
economists, etc.   But, the information is all there in the public domain.
<br>
Ron h.
