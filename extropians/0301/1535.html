</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, I'll admit that *why* the U.S./U.K. are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war is not so important as analyzing the probable results.
</em><br>
<p>What is interesting is the oil economics if you dovetail it with global
<br>
warming politics.
<br>
<p>It is a fact that the countries which are the biggest proponents of
<br>
theories of catastrophic anthropic global warming are also those with
<br>
the largest a) welfare social state apparatus, and b) degrees of
<br>
taxation of fossil fuels which are spent on that welfare state.
<br>
<p>I have stated on occasion that it is my belief that this is the case
<br>
because this high degree of social welfare, from socialized national
<br>
health care to unemployment and education subsidies in these countries
<br>
puts their economies at a competetive disadvantage to more free market
<br>
nations like the US, which enjoys relatively low fossil fuel taxation
<br>
and limited social welfare. These countries want global governmental
<br>
solutions to the alleged greenhouse effect in order to force us to
<br>
implement similar high fossil fuel taxes.
<br>
<p>How does this apply to the Iraq situation? While the US satisfies the
<br>
majority of its oil needs via domestic reserves, and much of the rest
<br>
via Mexico and Venezuela, this is not in a vacuum. The oil market is a
<br>
global market, and a restriction of middle eastern supplies to europe
<br>
causes europe to bid on oil from Mexico and Venezuela, thus raising
<br>
their prices.
<br>
<p>By keeping the US from replacing the Iraq government (and thus causing
<br>
Iraq to freely produce oil at Pre-Gulf War levels), europe keeps oil
<br>
prices artificially raised. Oil prices in a free Iraq world would be
<br>
around $10/bbl. They are currently around $30/bbl, partly due to the
<br>
restriction on Iraqi oil exports, partly on the Venezuelan civil
<br>
conflict (which can also be traced to left wing organizations), and
<br>
partly on global uncertainty over future US actions in Iraq.
<br>
<p>Europe has a vested domestic interest in keeping the US from liberating
<br>
Iraq, in that if oil prices drop to $10/bbl in a post-Saddam world,
<br>
European oil/gas tax revinues will drop precipitously, US products will
<br>
drop in cost faster than european products, leading to reductions in
<br>
european exports and increases in imports from the US, causing
<br>
increases in unemployment, decreases in income taxes, and widespread
<br>
domestic unrest. Governments will be forced to drastically limit social
<br>
welfare services, causing greater unrest, or else drastic increases in
<br>
taxes, causing unrest and capital flight.
<br>
<p>In the end, it will spell a further condemnation of socialist policies
<br>
in europe, and an endorsement of free market US policies. Socialist
<br>
parties in power across europe cannot let this happen as a matter of
<br>
their own survival in power.
