<p>[shakes head genially] Ahem.

<p>I think the entire arena of creating and bringing up new human or AI lives is,
<br>
and always has been, *charged* with issues of almost intolerable complexity.
<br>
I prefer that we do our best to be nice. I never promoted &quot;forbidd[ing]&quot;.
<br>
I expressed a preference.
<br>
<p>Edward de Bono has famously said &quot;Critical thinking is cheap thinking.&quot;
<br>
Lots of rhetoric, including pop-up Socratic dialogs, seems cheap to me, too.
<br>
<p>You use the word &quot;tradeoff&quot; in a breezy way, and then claim there are none.
<br>
You ask for consistency. This suggests that you find my consistency lacking.
<br>
If so, it might not be for the reason you think (see below). I am unsure what
<br>
any consequence of a lack of consistency would be, in your view, beyond your
<br>
disapproval or deprecation. Not that I think that's especially in evidence here.
<br>
<p>Many aspects of human thought are inconsistent; &quot;society of mind&quot; and all that.
<br>
<p>Some people even claim that a recognition of contradiction is the primary sign
<br>
of human maturity. I am not positive that it is, or that maturity is a purely good thing--
<br>
and I don't mean to bring that up in a deprecatory way. There's the other lovely saying,
<br>
&quot;There is nothing 'mature wisdom' resembles more than 'being too tired'.&quot; I bring this up
<br>
to reflect on the seeming fact that the more [many] people look at it, &quot;reality&quot;
<br>
seems to not always admit of tidy concise consistency that is also correct--that
<br>
we (humanity) sometimes [[think we] have to] settle for hacks, patches or splines
<br>
rather than a unified explicable no-holes theory of ethics. Feel free to call that wrong.
<br>
But wrong, compared to what?
<br>
<p>The &quot;cash value&quot; of many simple, claimed-&quot;consistent&quot; philosophies seems low to me.
<br>
<p>I think it would be prudent to do a lot more cloning work with other animals /
<br>
models before splashing off into cloning people. Evidently, you do not think that.
<br>
<p>I think it would be a good idea to treat all living beings with kindness.
<br>
Yet I eat meat on a regular basis. Evidently, I don't think what I think.
<br>
I am aware of the contradiction. &quot;Well, sue me, I'm not mechanical.&quot;
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>I am not here to have an argument. I am here as part of a civilization.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I forget.
