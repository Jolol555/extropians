Mike Lorrey:
<br>
<em>&gt;Having not learned Italian, I'm not quite sure what &quot;Consiglio&quot; is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though Google says it is 'council'. Okay. What are you doing
</em><br>
<p>There's not necessarily an overlap between what the job actually is
<br>
and what is written on paper in my contract. (well, this is Italy.)
<br>
Work related to existing and in-the-process-of-being- built infrared
<br>
spectrometers on space missions: Cassini, Rosetta, Dawn, Venus
<br>
Express. My old boss likes to say it is still about dust, but remote
<br>
sensing. My dust work with my old Heidelberg group continues too.
<br>
The idea is that this is a permanent job (that was/is my goal), so
<br>
we'll see how both sides feel after the trial period.
<br>
<p>btw: CNR (&quot;National Research Council&quot;) is the network of national
<br>
research institutes like the Max-Planck-Institutes in Germany or the
<br>
CNRSs in France. However Berlusconi has been trying to eliminate
<br>
them for the last year (whether he will succeed, is not clear, in
<br>
any case, there are enormous budget cuts causing large problems),
<br>
and CNR won't be my parent institution for long anyway. IFSI is
<br>
moving to be under the network of astronomical observatories (INAF
<br>
is the acronym, I think) in the sometime future, which makes more
<br>
sense for this group.
