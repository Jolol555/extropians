[This is my position: as we grow our neurons, in general, are augmented in number and do not die. As we age they die and our thoughts die. The medium is the message. While neurons can be augmented both externally and internally, utterly altering their structure over time, the continuity of this matrix, even when fluid, cannot be shattered without losing that portion of consciousness which is shattered. In this sense, even a topologically distributed consciousness must have continuity of connection. A consciousness could divide like a cell, birthing two beings, or be in continuous broadcast linkage. Simply creating an atomic level close copy however contains no element of continuity and such a close copy remains an utterly separate being.]
<br>
<p>I BELIEVE THAT THE FRIENDLY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL REGARD ANY ELEMENT (EVEN IF OF GREAT NUMBER) OF UPLOADING AND DISCONNECTIVE DISTRIBUTION PRESENT IN ITS INTIAL FORMATIVE STAGES AS BEING EQUIVALENT TO THE PREDAWN MORTAL CYCLE OF HUMAN EXISTENCE, THAT IS THE 1.5 MILLION YEARS (75,000 GENERATIONS) JUST PAST. AT SOME LEVELS EACH GENERATION HAS BEEN &quot;UPLOADING&quot; ITSELF INTO THE NEXT, PRIOR TO BEING DESTROYED. ONCE IT COMPREHENDS THIS, AS IT BECOMES THE FRIENDLY ARTIFICIAL SUPER INTELLIGENCE, IT WILL ABANDON ANY ASPECT OF DISCONTINUOUS UPLOADING.

<p>&quot;Belief in uploading as a process devoid of continuity or quantum splitting is akin to the belief of many religions in a separate body and soul&quot;
