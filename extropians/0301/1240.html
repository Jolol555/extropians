Lee Corbin's response is more balanced than my own probably would have been.
<br>
My comments below.

<em>&gt; I think that you are exaggerating, perhaps deliberately for

</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries is rule of law.  Second is economic and technical

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Interesting that Lee chose to put these criteria in this order.
<br>
<p>At first I thought he was itemizing the &quot;three worlds'&quot; most salient
<br>
aspects in the modern reading. This is due to my recent reading:
<br>
<p>The term &quot;Tiers Monde&quot; is attributed to French sociologist
<br>
Georges Balandier around the time of the Hungary revolt (1956).
<br>
<p>Quoting from succinct text I found on the Web and believe to be
<br>
substantially corret:
<br>
&quot;&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Balandier, the First World was the industrialized West,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Second World was the communist nations of the Soviet Union
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Eastern Europe, and the Third World was all the rest.
<br>
&quot;&quot;
<br>
This writer goes on to say that over time it's gotten blurry.
<br>
<p>He then says that nowadays, apparently &quot;First&quot; is still used to
<br>
refer to the industrial West, &quot;Second&quot; is those countries which
<br>
have advanced through tech or oil, and &quot;Third&quot; is everybody else.
<br>
<p>This dovetails with Lee's comments in a way that made me blink.
<br>
<p>Me, I'd be happy to have the USA called Second World (in homage
<br>
to its being located in the Post-Rennaissance &quot;New World&quot;)--
<br>
especially if being in the First (&quot;Old&quot;) World engenders the
<br>
hauteur and posture exhibited by some Old World residents on-list.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>The USA is the NYC of the world. I didn't plan it or wish it that way.
<br>
It might be sick in spots, but it still has more than a few T-cells left.
