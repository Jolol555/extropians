<em>&gt; Well, if you are saying people lead best by example, I heartilly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree. However, with the Islamic Militant mentality, your success will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely produce increased hatred through that magical, word...envy. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would envy and hate us more for our success then our good intentions.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have any better idea yet, than to offer the ideas on which our 
<br>
system relies, while on the other hand protect these ideas and values for 
<br>
ourselves. I don't want to trade freedom for safety, but I also don't 
<br>
want to live in constant angst of becoming victim of some fanatics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We went into Afghanistan for our own selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason-to retaliate and disrupt the attackers of 9-11, from their base.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the Afghani people were freed, that came as a side-effect. Had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taleban turned over Osama, we likely would never had invaded.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. That's why I don't buy any &quot;we have to bring freedom and 
<br>
democracy&quot; arguments regarding the Iraq. I'd gladly accept a worldwide 
<br>
campaign for freedom and democracy, and I would praise the US if they'd 
<br>
lead that campaign. After the middle-east, North Korea would be on my 
<br>
list, as well as several regions in Africa. Such an initiative could 
<br>
perhaps even push China - if we could achieve a worldwide embargo for 
<br>
example. Unfortunately, not many regimes care for moral, when profit is 
<br>
at stake. Together with my impression that there's no real present danger 
<br>
yet (see my other mails), I therefore tend to look for other reasons for 
<br>
Mr Bushs war monging.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not so sure, Morgenthau wasn't right. Turn Deutschland into 3 or 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large cantons and make them pacifist. It appears to be the direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Schroeder wants anyway, so perhaps Morgenthau was prescien?
</em><br>
<p>IIRC, Morgenthaus plan was to knock down all industrial equipment in 
<br>
Germany and make it a agriculture-only country, so that no military 
<br>
infrastructure could ever be developed here.
<br>
<p>That's clearly not the way Schröder thinks :-) He's also not overly 
<br>
pacifistic. In the evening of 9-11-2001, he officially announced that 
<br>
Germany would provide &quot;unreserved solidarity&quot; to the US and AFAIK, he has 
<br>
kept his word. The socialdemocratic/green coalition has been the first 
<br>
government of Germany who send german soldiers into actual battles, first 
<br>
in former Yugoslavia, then in Afghanistan. That wasn't easy in a land, 
<br>
where grantparents and even parents narrations about war times don't 
<br>
tell about heroism, but about death, hunger, displacement and the loss of 
<br>
friends and belongings.
<br>
<p>IMO, Schröder has two goals: First to follow the public will. Over 70% in 
<br>
Germany (and in UK, btw) don't see any sense in attacking Iraq. Second to 
<br>
relieve the pressure on the economy. Angst is not good for business. Even 
<br>
the estimations of the US government say that a long war (&gt;12 weeks) will 
<br>
topple the world (and US) economy into a recession.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the Muslim world wants to go off the deep end because it craves to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blame the USA for all its ills they, or anyone else are welcome to try.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't this more a problem of information? We know there's plenty of money 
<br>
in that region, but it's in the hand of a small elite. But what do the 
<br>
people there know? Remember the very limited sources of information in 
<br>
Iraq. You'll meet 23mio. people who think you are the spurce of all evil, 
<br>
because you have deprived them of food, medicaments, etc., because the 
<br>
official propaganda says so. How many Iraqis know about the UN, the ABC 
<br>
weapons? According to a german news program last week, many Iaqis still 
<br>
believe than Iran had attacked them in the eighties, because propaganda 
<br>
says so.
