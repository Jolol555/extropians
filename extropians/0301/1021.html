<em>&gt; Y'know, I think he has a point there.  It may sound dreadfully banal, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's still a hell of a strong argument:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>

It's worth remembering that it was General Sherman who originated the quote 
<br>
&quot;War is Hell.&quot;  This didn't stop him from creating a miles wide path of 
<br>
destruction &quot;from Atlanta to the sea&quot;.
<br>
War has always been both a &quot;total fucking human disaster&quot; and a tool of 
<br>
policy.  Acceptable ignores the question of &quot;Acceptable to whom?&quot;, just as 
<br>
disaster ignores the question of &quot;Disaster for whom?&quot;.  The people in charge 
<br>
of governments frequently consider anything acceptable if it isn't a disaster 
<br>
for them, and any policy acceptable if it helps them.  Being an inhuman 
<br>
monster may not be a requirement for the job, but it certainly doesn't seem 
<br>
to be a bar.  And if the disaster is to their own citizenry, it doesn't 
<br>
matter (to the leaders) as long as they can get it blamed on someone else.
