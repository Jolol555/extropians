<em>&gt; &gt; So I think that some form of technological community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integration tool would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be very beneficial to the transhuman community at this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The integration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between ExI boards and mailing lists is a first step in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a technology point of view. What I have in mind would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;all places are one place&quot; ilk:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it would be a terrific idea to have one big &gt;H site, with news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and articles, that we all coorporate on. And if such a site will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into existence I am willing to support it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I am afraid that it is a doomed idea to make one site to cover it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all. We are all very much individualists, and so want to do our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing our own way. So we all want to be site owners.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. My suggestion was not for one big &gt;H site -- there is no central
<br>
repository in the plan, just a central clearing house with no associated
<br>
site. My suggestion is a way for everyone to be able to build their own
<br>
individual sites, and still have the big &gt;H community output on that site.
<br>
So every new site can do its own thing and still incrementally add community
<br>
to the whole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that the best way to do this sort of thing instead, would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have some sort of &quot;comunity license&quot; where we share our content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freely. So that we could each put our articles online, and other sites
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could copy them. With a proper copyright notice in the bottom of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something like:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Article title&quot;, by author
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This article first appeared on:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.originalsite.org/articletitle.htm">http://www.originalsite.org/articletitle.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This content is protected by the Transhumanist comunity license at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/comunity_license.htm">http://www.transhumanism.org/comunity_license.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----------------------------------------
</em><br>
<p>Which is also great. Copylefting everything an individual site does is up to
<br>
the site owner -- I think it's beneficial, but many article contributers
<br>
refuse to do this sort of thing.
<br>
<p>In any case, articles are not the subject. I'm really talking about fusing
<br>
the disparate and separated transhumanist and pro-transhumanist online
<br>
communities into a closer configuration, allowing greater cross-pollination.
<br>
It is from community that things emerge, not from the posting of articles
<br>
(writing and posting articles is something that emerges from community, like
<br>
leaders, and new sites). So the content I'm talking about is e-mail, chat,
<br>
forum postings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That way we could get the best of both worlds, where authors can put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something online, others can copy it and put it on their site, if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fullfill the comunity license. The comunity would get much more out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's efforts. And every site owner would be working for their own little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ego ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Basically, yes, except as above, I'm talking about casual authorship. Email,
<br>
postings, chat: community.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I believe that we should look to create a comunity license instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a big technical solution. It would be self organisation in a distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that works, we could then allways create some xml schemas so that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process could be automated.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;big technical solution&quot; I am referring to is pretty much the same thing
<br>
as &quot;create some xml schemas so that the process can be automated.&quot; It's not
<br>
a hugely onerous or complex piece of work, given the initial goals.
