HAIL, CAESAR
<br>
<p><p>A clever new design could lead to a kinder, gentler form of nuclear power
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1559861">http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1559861</a>
<br>
<p>The Economist print edition
<br>
<p><p><p>IT SOUNDS impossible: a nuclear reactor that generates electricity from
<br>
nuclear waste. Yet that is what Claudio Filippone, a nuclear scientist and
<br>
director of the Centre for Advanced Energy Concepts at the University of
<br>
Maryland, proposed a few years ago. He has now devised an improved design,
<br>
called CAESAR (³clean and environmentally safe advanced reactor²) that is
<br>
even more counterintuitive. As well as being environmentally friendly‹it can
<br>
produce electricity without causing any extra pollution‹his new design could
<br>
also help prevent nuclear proliferation.
<br>
<p>Conventional nuclear reactors run on fuel rods made largely of uranium-238,
<br>
enriched with about 4% uranium-235. If you hit a uranium-235 atom with a
<br>
neutron, it releases a tiny amount of energy and breaks up into smaller
<br>
nuclei and more neutrons, which can in turn hit other atoms. Pack atoms
<br>
close enough together, and a self-sustaining reaction occurs, producing a
<br>
vast amount of energy in the form of heat. Several things control the
<br>
reaction rate, including a ³moderator² that is inserted between the fuel
<br>
rods to slow down some of the neutrons so that they move slowly enough to
<br>
split atoms. After two or three years, there are so few uranium-235 atoms
<br>
left that the reaction cannot sustain itself. At this point, fresh fuel rods
<br>
are needed.
<br>
<p>Nuclear Energy
<br>
<p>Popular Mechanics posts an article about Dr Filippone's earlier work. See
<br>
also the Nuclear Research Institute of Rez.
<br>
<p>In contrast, Dr Filippone's new design works by splitting the far more
<br>
numerous uranium-238 atoms inside fuel rods. Such atoms are very picky. To
<br>
get them to split, you have to hit them with a neutron going at exactly the
<br>
right speed. (Uranium-235 and plutonium atoms are far less choosy, so
<br>
getting a self-sustaining reaction going is relatively easy‹hence their use
<br>
in weapons.) The key to the new design is the unusual choice of moderator:
<br>
steam. Steam's density can be controlled very finely, so it can be used to
<br>
slow passing neutrons to ensure that they are moving at exactly the right
<br>
speed to split a uranium-238 atom.
<br>
<p>The result is a tiny burst of energy, more neutrons and smaller nuclei, as
<br>
usual. But CAESAR exploits the fact that these smaller nuclei also decay to
<br>
produce additional, slow-moving neutrons, known as ³delayed neutrons². In a
<br>
conventional reactor, the moderator slows these neutrons down so much that
<br>
they cannot contribute to the reaction. But when steam is used as the
<br>
moderator, the delayed neutrons keep going until they hit another
<br>
uranium-238 atom. It should then be possible to maintain a self-sustaining
<br>
reaction in ³spent² fuel rods of pure uranium-238 for several decades. So
<br>
material now treated as waste could be used as fuel. The problem of
<br>
disposing of spent fuel will remain, but CAESAR is, in effect, a form of
<br>
waste storage that produces electricity.
<br>
<p>The design also has implications for preventing nuclear proliferation. The
<br>
cores of existing reactors have to be accessible so that fuel rods can be
<br>
moved in and out. By adjusting the configuration of the core in the right
<br>
way‹by judicious positioning of graphite, for example‹almost any civilian
<br>
reactor can be made to produce plutonium, and thus to make weapons. Access
<br>
to the core is not necessary with CAESAR, as it could run for decades
<br>
without any need for refuelling. Thus it could be sealed. Countries could
<br>
then adopt the design to show that their nuclear intentions were entirely
<br>
peaceful.
<br>
<p>Dr Filippone has tested some aspects of his design using the experimental
<br>
TRIGA reactor at the University of Maryland, and in computer simulations.
<br>
But to prove that it will work he has to demonstrate a self-sustaining
<br>
reaction in uranium-238. Working with Ivo Vasa of the Nuclear Research
<br>
Institute in Rez, in the Czech Republic, he is now looking for the money
<br>
needed to perform such an experiment, which is expected to take about two
<br>
years and cost around $2m. With luck, his new design will generate a
<br>
favourable reaction.
