<p>
a cogent summary from Jonah Goldberg: 
<br>
<p>______________________________________________________________________________
<br>
This was all the rage when I was in college during the first Gulf War and it
<br>
hasn't gotten any better with age. The basic argument goes like this: Bush and
<br>
Cheney are oil guys. They want to get their grubby hands on Iraq's oil. Ergo,
<br>
this is a war for oil. I guess it could be stated with more sophistication, but
<br>
why go to all the trouble of putting a dress on a pig? As Peter Beinart of The
<br>
New Republic notes in his latest - and excellent - column (registration
<br>
required), war is not the best means to get at Iraq's oil. If all we wanted was
<br>
a bigger slice of the Iraqi petro-pie, all we'd have to do, literally, is say
<br>
so. Dick Cheney could negotiate that with Saddam over Turkish coffee and a few
<br>
tortured lackeys tomorrow. Saddam has made it known that he'd be perfectly
<br>
willing to sell a lot more oil to the United States, and that he'd certainly
<br>
write up some fresh contracts if the U.S. would drop its sanctions and forget
<br>
about this &quot;regime change&quot; nonsense. 
<br>
<p>Going to war just to boost Iraq's oil production from three or so million
<br>
barrels a day to 6 or so million barrels a day involves massive risks, both
<br>
political and financial. A war on Iraq could ruin Iraq's oil fields. It could
<br>
foment instability in the region or a civil war inside Iraq. It could easily
<br>
cost the Republicans the White House if it went badly. In short, if this were
<br>
all about oil, any good businessman would simply say, &quot;Let's just lift the
<br>
sanctions.&quot; And, as Beinart notes, if all Bush wants is oil, why is the U.S.
<br>
making assurances to the French and Russians that they can keep their existing
<br>
contracts if they approve an invasion? 
<br>
<p>In fact, if Bush and Cheney are doing the bidding of the oil industry, someone
<br>
needs to explain why the American Petroleum Institute lobbied for the lifting of
<br>
sanctions prior to the 9/11 attacks. Also, you might ask why oil prices go up
<br>
when war becomes more likely, and go down when the prospects for peace improve. 
<br>
<p>But, in my mind, the most compelling response to the blood-for-oil argument is a
<br>
simple one. The people who make it are morons. Oh, I don't mean the folks who
<br>
say that, as a geopolitical necessity, the U.S. must assure stability in oil
<br>
markets, or those who (rightly) argue that we need to lessen the power and
<br>
influence of the Saudis. I mean the people who argue - Cynthia McKinney-style -
<br>
that Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld want to get rich off the war. This is the
<br>
Carlyle Group argument you hear on Pacifica Radio and in the sweatier fever
<br>
swamps of the web. The simple problem with this thesis is that it betrays a
<br>
fundamental misunderstanding of rich people. 
<br>
<p>Rich people who want to get richer do not run for president or vice president.
<br>
They don't take jobs as secretary of defense or treasury secretary. And, for
<br>
that matter, they don't run for senator - like John Edwards and Jon Corzine.
<br>
Such people may have selfish motives, but greed for filthy lucre isn't one of
<br>
them. They may like the power, they may want to do good, they may want their
<br>
names in the history books, they may even want to prove something to the
<br>
third-grade teachers who said they'd never amount to anything. But they don't do
<br>
it to make a killing in the stock market. Every day, I hear from people who
<br>
honestly think Bush &amp; co. want to invade Iraq to make a few more bucks. These
<br>
people are either stoopid or they are trapped in a Twilight Zone where Thomas
<br>
Nast cartoons seem real. 
<br>
<p>Indeed, this is the problem with most goofy theories about a war: They reveal a
<br>
profound naiveté about how government works. If Bush were doing this for oil or
<br>
for money or for &quot;revenge&quot; against the man who tried to kill his dad, he
<br>
wouldn't be able to say so in a single meeting. He couldn't say such a thing to
<br>
his inner circle, let alone his senior staff or the hundreds of people below
<br>
them who make the policy. Word would get out. Opponents would leak it. Ambitious
<br>
men would blow the whistle and become heroes. Decent men would blow the whistle
<br>
too. 
<br>
<p>In other words, Bush would have to keep all of his motives secret from the
<br>
people he'd have to convince to go along. Now, since most of these anti-Bush,
<br>
antiwar types also think the commander-in-chief is an idiot, it's hard to
<br>
imagine how they think he'd be smart enough to pull off a con like that.
