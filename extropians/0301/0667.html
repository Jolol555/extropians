<p>Not really Nathanael -- even if ones perspective potentially harms some

subset of list members, one would hope that we could try to debate it

in an open and constructive fashion.

<p><em>&gt; Why aren't these books available on programs like napster. There are a ton

</em><br>
<p>As to the &quot;why&quot;, that is fairly easy to answer.  Most content producers
<br>
(those who have electronic copies of the media) don't run around publishing
<br>
their materials in open forums because this amounts to (in the current
<br>
environment) shooting oneself in the foot.  This is what generated the
<br>
big blowup about Elcom/Sklyarov cracking the Adobe eBook format.
<br>
<p>There appears to be a catalog of registered copyrights:
<br>

<br>

<p><em>&gt; I mean i haven't bought a CD in like 5 years. Why shouldn't we be able to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you think this is true, you haven't been reading Slashdot and other
<br>
sources re: the various efforts regarding the RIAA and enforcement of the
<br>
DMCA or some of the laws being floated before congress at this time.  It
<br>
isn't for lack of *trying* to solve the problem.  It is because
<br>
to really solve it one has to trump both (a) encryption technology
<br>
and (b) distributed computing.  It doesn't seem likely that (a)
<br>
will happen without &quot;quantum computing&quot; or that (b) will happen without
<br>
some really strong revocation of the concept of &quot;privacy rights&quot;.
<br>
<p>Your ability to enjoy novel (new) music would disappear overnight
<br>
if all artists producing such content simply refused to release it
<br>
in a form that could be copied or redistributed.  (One could imagine
<br>
an &quot;active&quot; music player that simply refused to &quot;play&quot; a song unless
<br>
it could connect to a secure server and verify one owned a license
<br>
to listen to said song.  I.e. you have to provide a real-time thumb
<br>
print at human body temperatures matched with a voice print and
<br>
retina scan in order to enable the playing of specific songs for the next
<br>
24 hours.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Really though shouldn't these books be available to anyone for free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For transhumanistic ideas to gain a greater base shouldn't it be free like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bible.
</em><br>
<p>This depends on the author.  For example, I make many of the papers
<br>
I've written over the last decade available for free to anyone with
<br>
so much excess time on their hands that they will bother to read them.
<br>
Many other academic types do the same (though they usually go through
<br>
some &quot;producers&quot; to do so).  There is obviously quite a dichotomy
<br>
between Nature charging one $15.00 to receive a copy of a paper,
<br>
that I as an author could XoX and send to you for probably less
<br>
than $1.00.  Obviously the dichotomy gets much larger when one
<br>
considers that one can pay $15.00 for a 6-8 page paper from Nature
<br>
or $15.95 for &quot;The Spike&quot; (384 pages) from Amazon [even more
<br>
discounted if you get &quot;The Spike&quot; and &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;
<br>
for $21.64].  Is the information content of these books really
<br>
so low that academic papers can justify charging ~45x the amount
<br>
per page?
<br>
<p>The problem is this -- until one has really robust nanotech -- so
<br>
personal survival is not an issue (i.e. you can live off the &quot;fruit
<br>
of the land&quot; for free), then one *has* to pay the scientists, reporters,
<br>
authors, playrights, musicians, actors, etc. if one expects content
<br>
to be produced.  It seems likely that that will flip once one has
<br>
robust nanotech -- i.e. the producers will have to pay the consumers
<br>
to consume their product because there will be a shift in the relative
<br>
quantity of producers/consumers.  But for now producer # is &lt;&lt; consumer #
<br>
so the consumers should be paying in one way or another (taxes to direct
<br>
payments) for the content they find useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What it comes down to is where is the money going that is generated by these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books. If most of it is just going into someone's pocket tham I'm sorry that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems very unextropian to me. I know people have to make a living but beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there main concern should be to make as big an impact as they can.
</em><br>
<p>One has to keep in mind distribution numbers.  If a technical book,
<br>
e.g. Nanosystems or Nanomedicine, sells more than 10,000 copies it is
<br>
viewed as a blockbuster.  One has to contrast this with Michael Chrichton
<br>
novel or a Tom Hanks movie where one is dealing with quantities of millions.
<br>
I think there may be a bias within the production industry as to how
<br>
one goes about creating a Michael or a Tom (so one can get the economies
<br>
of scale bumped by 2-3 orders of magnitude).  Whether that is generally
<br>
good or bad I don't know.  It raises some paradoxical questions as to
<br>
how one can have a &quot;big impact&quot; if one doesn't have a &quot;name&quot; and how
<br>
one can have a &quot;name&quot; if someone hasn't invested in creating that and
<br>
how one can &quot;invest in creating a name&quot; if one doesn't skim funds from
<br>
what one knows are really unprofitable ventures in order to invest those
<br>
funds into &quot;name creation&quot;.
<br>
<p>Food for thought.
<br>
