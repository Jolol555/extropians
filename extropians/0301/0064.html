&nbsp;A poster on wta-talk said yesterday he would go
<br>
<em>&gt; ahead with making a human version of Doogie mice. He thought higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chronical pain sensitivity would be a tolerable tradeoff to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (undemonstrated in people) somewhat higher smarts. What?
</em><br>
---------------------------
<br>
<p>That was me; I guess the best way to explain my point of view is if the
<br>
option was available to my parents, I would be happy if they had chosen it
<br>
for me.
<br>
<p>You're right of course about the embryo screening to make sure there's no
<br>
damage - but I thought this technology already existed and has been used to
<br>
screen out stuff like CF?
