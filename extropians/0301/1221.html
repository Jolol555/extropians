<p>The immediate effect on war would be negative, assuming that some people
<br>
would die before they would have died if the war would not have
<br>
happened.  How many people?  No idea.  Some people said 100,000 on the
<br>
last one, so if there's a repeat, I would consider it a big negative (if
<br>
a bus crashes and 10 people die is &quot;tragedy&quot;, and 3000 on WTC qualifies
<br>
for &quot;horrible, despicable event&quot; and 6,000,000 gets a &quot;holocaust&quot;, then
<br>
100,000 probably hits around &quot;unbelievable massacre&quot; label or so). 
<br>
There would also be a sizable negative property score for damaged
<br>
buildings in Iraq, probably a sizable possitive property score to the US
<br>
military business and to world media businesses, some points for
<br>
enjoyment of &quot;marines getting some action&quot;, some for the US population
<br>
feeling safer, some substracted for some of the US population feeling
<br>
guilty, and a sizable negative score for iraqi suffering at the loss of
<br>
relatives and friends, but none of those (except maybe by the last one),
<br>
I would think, would put much of a dent on the -100,000 full points that
<br>
we started with.  Now, since the post-war effects are unknown, and I
<br>
can't assign probabilities to what the possible outcomes will be (if you
<br>
can, please post), they would have to be given a neutral or zero score. 
<br>
In which case the war stays at &quot;unbelievable massacre&quot; level, and should
<br>
be a no-go.
