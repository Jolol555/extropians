<p><p>Due to the EU, the eropean countries are in far less chance of going to

war with each other than ever before. The US no longer plays any serious

role in this.
<br>
<p>I would dare to say that there are regions that needs protection a lot 
<br>
more then the EU, where there are no US troops.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Why did France test those nukes *right after German reunification*?

<em>&gt; Anyone care to answer? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?
</em><br>
<p><p>No idea. Perhaps to detere Russia/the Soviet union from interfering in 
<br>
the reunification?
<br>
<p>I very much doubt that the French fears a war with Germany. When 
<br>
traveling through Europe these days, there are no animosity to find 
<br>
among the natives. Neither among the politicians.
<br>
<p>The gulf between EU and US is far wider than the gulf between the EU 
<br>
member states. Even though must of us still considder the US to be 
<br>
friends and allieds.
<br>
<p>The US stands in risk of loosing that goodwill though, due to the 
<br>
arrogant attitudes towards anybody not seeing eye to eye with them.
<br>
<p>It also rears it's ugly head on this list.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Or you could be right. But--if you truly believe there's always only

</em><br>
<p><p>When did I say there was only one reason? I have no doubt that there are 
<br>
other good reasons for the US to have troops here. But the main reason 
<br>
is shurely US self-interrest.
