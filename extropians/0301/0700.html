<p>Actually I meant something very specific by &quot;intellectual hubris,&quot; and
<br>
in fact that was probably not the best term for my purpose. Lee Corbin
<br>
knows from our past exchanges what I mean (or at least he will now that
<br>
I am explaining it :-)
<br>
<p>The intellectual hubris to which I refer is the same kind of hubris that
<br>
characterized the ancient Sophists that so annoyed Socrates and Plato.
<br>
In the modern parlance, &quot;sophist&quot; is understood usually as an insult,
<br>
and that is probably how Lee has taken it from me in the past, but I do
<br>
not mean it so much as an insult as I do as an actual characterization
<br>
of his general *philosophy* in most all subjects that we've discussed.
<br>
The ancient Sophists were rather higher regarded in some circles. It
<br>
should not be seen necessarily as a derogatory label, (even if I find
<br>
the ancient Sophists to have been as annoying as did Socrates and
<br>
Plato).
<br>
<p>Sophism, as it was understood in ancient times, was essentially the
<br>
belief that &quot;man is the measure of all things.&quot; This is, IMO, an
<br>
arrogant and anthropocentric approach to understanding reality. It is
<br>
also clearly Lee Corbin's philosophy with respect to human rights and
<br>
many other things. In Lee's view a right is merely a matter of personal
<br>
opinion and social convention -- something that he &quot;approves of&quot; and
<br>
which other people also &quot;approve of.&quot; This is in direct contrast to the
<br>
more intellectually humbling beliefs of truth seekers such as Plato and
<br>
Socrates (and Thomas Jefferson). These great men believed that objective
<br>
truths of nature exist separate from any man's opinion.
