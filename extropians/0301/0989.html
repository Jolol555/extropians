While it makes sense to me that there is objective Truth that we strive to
<br>
approach, if we want to enjoy the mutual benefits of interacting with other
<br>
humans, then we need to understand that each one of us carries their own
<br>
version of &quot;truth&quot; with them to the discussion.  If we're going to deal
<br>
effectively with other people, then it's worthwhile to understand where
<br>
they're coming from, and acknowledge it, and look for ways to refine and
<br>
enhance understanding.
<br>
<p>Without getting into the whole philosophical morass of what constitutes
<br>
&quot;truth&quot; (subjective, objective, pragmatic...) my point is that *to be
<br>
effective* in a discussion with another human being, you have to acknowledge
<br>
the validity (to them) of their knowledge base and values.  People who don't
<br>
understanding this may see it as being indecisive, weak, or wishy-washy.
<br>
People who do understand this see it as being effective in their dealings
<br>
with human beings.
<br>
<p>I think what Anders tried to point out. is that the more you know about a
<br>
subject, and how it relates to the rest of the universe, the better you can
<br>
see another person's point of view and understand how that point of view and
<br>
your own point of view may fit into the bigger picture.  When you can &quot;widen
<br>
back&quot; and see how the other person's point of view fits, then you can have a
<br>
more effective discussion, leading toward greater objective understanding
<br>
for one or both parties.
<br>
<p>There is a part of our evolutionary and cultural makeup that tends to cause
<br>
us to defend our own views and attack outside views.  A more evolved
<br>
approach recognizes that there is no &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; view and that
<br>
they are both part of the bigger picture. This is *not* to say that all
<br>
views are equally valid in the obective sense.  It means that all views
<br>
*are* part of the bigger picture and recognizing this leads to more
<br>
effective discussion.
<br>
<p>For effective communication:  Understand your audience, acknowledge where
<br>
they're coming from, point out differences in a constructive way.
<br>
<p>So it comes down to the choice:  Is our purpose on this list to increase
<br>
understanding, or to score points?

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think there is no such choice?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet it seems that there are STRUCTURAL aspects of a list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; such as this, that make it hard for people to keep in mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; both that they HAVE this choice and that there are REAL

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Consider the exchange between Anders and Mike:

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; [Anders wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One prerequisite for having a constructive discussion about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; powerful topic is to be able to handle it on a high level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; abstraction. When you know enough about a topic you can start to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; look at it from different sides. You can be abstract enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it so that you become dispassionate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Mike replied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; On the contrary, the more you know about a topic, when that topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; turns on Objective Truth, the more likely you are to be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; passionate for the side which you are able to objectively,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; quantitatively, and qualitatively determine is in the right. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; opposition begins, more and more, to look not just wrong, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; foolish, naive, stubbornly obstinate in their willful ignorance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and willing to believe anything that agrees with their prejudices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It's quite clear that the more someone learns about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; issue, the less affected is his or her basic personality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; disposition!
