<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the whole point of Sowell's &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I've had to consult lately, is that deciding the *level* at which
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Brett. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who actually has the power now ... to *actually*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decide who gets to make these decisions in society? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a deep question.  My suggested answer is that we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide, both individually and collectively.
</em><br>
<p>Ok. But is the question important? 
<br>
<p>I mean, in your view, do you think it would be useful for us to 
<br>
know, to identify, who *actually* has the power to decide the
<br>
&quot;level at which different decisions occur in our society [that are]
<br>
crucial to society's well-being&quot;? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think that legislators decide - note th[ey] tend to vote 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bills into laws in bunches not simply on their lonesome ?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think that citizens in democracies decide and if so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how?  Merely through voting or are other avenues open?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, yes, and yes.  The legislators have the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate and direct influence, but the voters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elect the legislators.  Yet the voters are affected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by memes, including yours and mine.  So we all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participate in deciding at what level decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitutions exist to record and embody principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known to be wise, and for the most part these principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide that many decisions be left up to smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodies at lower levels.  The ultimate freedoms, speech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to bear arms, right to trial by jury, and so on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in these instruments reserved for those at the lowest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels, the individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in this way, the hands of the legislators are presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tied.  So, in summary, we would have to add to your list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     legislators and representatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     voters and electors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   * ideas and memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   * constitutional guarantees
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting but I think that the additions you make would not 
<br>
normally be considered &quot;who's&quot; in the question &quot;who decides
<br>
who decides&quot;.
<br>
<p>I think ideas are a subset of memes. And I think memes can be
<br>
metaphorically described as capturing mindspace like genes
<br>
were described by Dawkins in The Selfish Gene as selfish. 
<br>
<p>I would agree that memes can influence decisive agents such as
<br>
people. But do you think memes become decisive agents in
<br>
themselves? 
<br>
<p>Does it really make sense in terms of deciding who actually 
<br>
decides to try and also take account of a memes point of view? 
<br>
<p>It seems that we are in agreement that it is the constitution and 
<br>
legislation that codifies the legal rights people have and therefore
<br>
codifies who actually gets to decide particular things at particular
<br>
levels.   
<br>
<p>Wouldn't you say that laws and constitutional guarantees are 
<br>
codifications rather than decisive agents in themselves? 
<br>
<p>It seems we can't really appeal to memes or constitutions to
<br>
change themselves. I suspect that whilst your additions 
<br>
to the list make sense if the question was &quot;what are some of the
<br>
things that influence who decides who decides&quot; but I'm not
<br>
so sure that they add any further active agents. It seems
<br>
like constitutional guarantees are interpreted, enforced and even
<br>
occasionally formulated and codified but they are not actually
<br>
consulted. 
<br>
<p>I reckon we can reduce the domain of &quot;who decides who decides&quot;
<br>
merely to &quot;sentient agents&quot;. To actual people. Wouldn't you agree? 
<br>
<p>Brett
