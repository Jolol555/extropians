<em>&gt; &gt; Yeah, I had wondered about that in his posts. So the USA should be

<em>&gt; No, but your president and his fellows should think a little bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further. It's not enough to throw some bombs, when this just feeds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the troops of another enemy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War against terrorism is not comparable with conventional wars. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means fighting against belief systems and against the causes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation of those people. 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, all wars are caused by different nations or cultures
<br>
having dissonant belief systems. Wars are won when one side so
<br>
thoroughly beats the crap out of the other that a state of cognitive
<br>
shock occurs in the minds of the populace that allows the dislodging of
<br>
the unacceptable belief system from their minds. 
<br>
<p>In WWII, we bombed the shit out of Germany so significantly that most
<br>
all of the populace decided a) they didn't wanna play no more, b) that
<br>
Naziism/Fascism might be a dumb idea, cause it obviously don't work as
<br>
well as freedom does, since they free people are kicking our asses.
<br>
<p>We kicked Germany's asses so significantly that today you are hard
<br>
pressed to find anybody who will admit to ever having been or even
<br>
knowing any nazis. They will claim they didn't know that millions of
<br>
Jews, Catholics, Gays and Gypsies were being gassed, shot, starved, and
<br>
executed. 
<br>
<p>We kicked Japan's asses so hard that they realized that their
<br>
militaristic regieme was inferior to the American system of freedom and
<br>
rule of law, so much so that they accorded General MacArthur treatment
<br>
reserved only for their Emperor: when the General drove or walked down
<br>
the street, Japanese people turned their backs to him to demonstrate
<br>
they were not fit to lay their eyes upon him. They then set about
<br>
adopting our system of capitalism, they accepted the Constitution that
<br>
MacArthur wrote for them, and went about practicing both so seriously
<br>
they almost kicked our asses economically 15 years ago...
