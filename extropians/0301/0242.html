<p>&quot;I'm sorry Jeff but somehow I didn't see your solid
<br>
authentic credible evidence that communism is not
<br>
evil,...&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, now John, you know that's not what I've been
<br>
doing in this thread.  Others provided  anecdotal
<br>
'factoids' utterly corrupted by the fanatical
<br>
emotional context of secular fundamentalism--the
<br>
hysteria of 'fundamentalist' anti-communism.  I simply
<br>
provided--and require in return--authentic
<br>
documentation, verifiable historic facts, and credible
<br>
reportage.  Hysteria vs facts.  It's not rocket
<br>
science.  
<br>
<p>&quot;...I'd really appreciate it if you would
<br>
repost it as it could really change my world view...&quot;
<br>
<p>You can always go to the archives, but of course,
<br>
John, your comment was facetious.  You're not
<br>
genuinely interested in anything I have to say. 
<br>
Regarding anything from me about
<br>
socialism/communism/vietnam, your mind is already made
<br>
up.  No?
<br>
<p>I have no strong feelings about communism one way or
<br>
the other.  I don't blame communism for Stalin any
<br>
more than I blame the Spanish Inquisition on Jesus.  
<br>
<p>I think capitalism is a good thing.  Gently regulated
<br>
to prevent it from biting the many small, trusting
<br>
hands that feed it.  I think freedom is a good thing,
<br>
too.  I like the idea and the practice of political
<br>
freedom and the consent of the governed.  The idea of
<br>
voting as a means of confirming that consent seems to
<br>
me feasible and equitable.  I think it entirely
<br>
reasonable to allow the commies to stand for election
<br>
amidst the throng of competing political creatures. 
<br>
And if they should win the vote, I think the governed
<br>
are entitled to enjoy/suffer the consequences of their
<br>
choice freely made.  
<br>
<p>Less than that isn't freedom.  At best it's
<br>
paternalism, at worst conventional subjugation.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental
<br>
ills of society. If we're looking for the sources of
<br>
our troubles, we shouldn't test people for drugs, we
<br>
should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and
<br>
love of power.&quot; - P. J. O'Rourke
