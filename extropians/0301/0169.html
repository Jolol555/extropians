Lee Corbin says:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have always clearly maintained that people are to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be accorded special status.
</em><br>
<p>*You* were the one who appealed to the happiness or otherwise of `the race
<br>
of cows'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But suppose we ask of a certain Terrence O'Reilly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the whole, taken as a package, was it good or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad for you that this happened?
</em><br>
<p>This is a simply absurd bid. On the whole, taken as a package, was slavery
<br>
or genital mutilation good or bad for the slaves and the female victims, was
<br>
it good or bad that this happened (given that it might have been avoided)?
<br>
This isn't rocket science either, Lee. As Eliezer pointed out:
<br>
<p>&lt; If you
<br>
terminate an existing mind, the termination event is undesirable.
<br>
Declining to create a *new* unhappy mind is not morally equivalent to
<br>
*killing* an unhappy mind.  Existing is different from not existing.  If
<br>
this isn't the case, then instantiating a particular mind has no effect;
<br>
it already has a Platonic existence [...].  If instantiating a mind
<br>
*does* make a moral difference, then among the moral differences it makes
<br>
is that *now* the mind has civil rights. &gt;
