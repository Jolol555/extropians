<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The notation &quot;Natural rights&quot; is very *inconvenient* for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, people do not mean the same thing by it at all.  Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious people mean something *quite* different from what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary materialists could possibly mean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  They may attribute such natural rights to 
<br>
different ultimate sources but that hardly means they disagree 
<br>
about what those rights are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, it gets very confused with &quot;natural law&quot; as this thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amply demonstrates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see what the beef is here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Third, semantically it would seem to allude to something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists in the *same* sense that laws of physics exist, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints on what is possible.  But human anthropology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much advanced over what it was in Jefferson's day, exposes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this as a complete fallacy:  we now know that insofar as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything like individual rights are concerned, the cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variance is incredible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This argument is empty.  Of course it is possible to violate 
<br>
someone's natural rights since the context is human interaction 
<br>
and humans have enough freedom of choice to act in such negative 
<br>
ways when the wish to.  The question is whether such actions are 
<br>
consistent with the naturally derivable conditions under which 
<br>
human beings flourish.  Jefferson never ever implied otherwise 
<br>
and your implication that he did is completely fallacious. 
<br>
Cultural variance does not in the least effect what is and is 
<br>
not a &quot;natural right&quot; of human beings.  It can only effect 
<br>
how/if they are recognized and upheld.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; As you wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Human brains are connected in ways we can observe, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;high-level behaviors have high-level consequences we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;behaviors lead to results we favor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It all depends on time, culture, and technical sophistication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It now appears to me that the extremely wide prevalence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human sacrifice in almost all early societies---the Druids,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Babylonians, the Maya, the Aztec, and, God knows, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early Hebrews, suggests that human sacrifice might have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a positive thing for early societies, at least in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it enabled them to prosper (more than their neighbors).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant.  At no time was human sacrifice congruent with 
<br>
natural rights.  You are confusing what was just untangled, the 
<br>
difference between natural rights and cultural norms or legal 
<br>
rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what then?  Are we to follow your reasoning and suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that human sacrifice is a part of natural law?  Moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess that you've got the ultimate argument that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use to dispose of the socialists:  &quot;You see,&quot; we tell them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Capitalism is just a part of natural law, resistance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futile&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is silly and unworthy of your intelligence.
