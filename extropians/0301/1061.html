</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll simply try to put a little personal spin on this from an &quot;extropic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective.  One of my neighbors recently posted a &quot;No Iraq War&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sign on their front lawn (these are very popular in Seattle which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is generally a green/pacifist haven).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been thinking about how one (I?) might respond to this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I like rhetorical discussions, so I'm thinking about posting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sign saying:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) How many Iranians died due to the will of Saddam Husein?
</em><br>
<p>How many of those did the US government encourage and aid him in 
<br>
killing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) How many Kuwaitis were killed or raped due to the will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of Saddam Husein?
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  Probably far less than you might believe.  How many 
<br>
Iraqis were killed *after* we told Saddam that the conflict 
<br>
between he and Kuwait was between them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) How many Iraqis (i.e. his own citizens) were killed due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    the will of Saddam Husein? 
</em><br>
<p>Dunno.  The famous gasing of the Kurds was covered up by us as 
<br>
accidental deaths in the crossfire by US for a while.  We even 
<br>
used our armed forces to clean up the mess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) Would you be comfortable with a person like Sadaam Husein
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    walking the streets of your neighborhood?
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  I also wouldn't be comfortable at all with Bush (Sr. or 
<br>
Jr.), Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld or a host of others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) If you are unwilling to have Saddam Husein living next to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    you then why are you comfortable having him live next to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    human beings like you in Baghdad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Why you are you comfortable with killing and proposing the 
<br>
killing of hundreds of thousands of humans just like you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may recall back a year or more ago, when I suggested what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought was a perfectly reasonable (utilitarian) solution in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wake of 911 which was to nuke Afghanistan so as to completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate it as a potential source of unextropic vectors.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I thought you must of come seriously unhinged after 911. 
<br>
Such a proposal is as unextropic as it gets.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soundly whacked in the side of the head for even considering such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an option.  Here is the key point -- I was at least considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the utilitarian perspective (e.g. the needs of the many outweigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the needs of the few).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You believe the many are served by obliterating the few by the 
<br>
country full from the face of the planet?  by sanctioning the 
<br>
use of nukes when we get pissed off?  by prophylacticly killing 
<br>
millions before they can be a threat?  If you really believe 
<br>
these things then I certainly wouldn't want you living in my 
<br>
neighborhood either.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; When you are thinking about Saddam &amp; Iraq you seriously have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask yourself whether one even gets up to that level (i.e. a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utilitarian tradeoff).  We are talking about a country with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a population of only 24 million people and the 2nd largest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven oil reserves (~112+ billion barrels) in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless I'm doing my math wrong, that suggests that each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi citizen is worth ~$140,000 dollars (less production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs).  Why are not *all* Iraqis living in &quot;palaces&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will throw down the gauntlet here.  I will assert that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Husein is a demonstrably unextropic vector (to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree that he destroys the citizens of other countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and holds back the development and advancement of the citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Iraq.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You have demonstrated that you yourself are capable of acting as 
<br>
a decidely unextropic and quite murderous vector.
<br>
<p>War generally is unextropic in the extreme.  Perpetual war even 
<br>
more so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This problem isn't going to go away.  I think if the non-U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on the list will review the history -- the U.S. did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by and large try to stay out of both WWI and WWII.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach did not work.  Furthermore, I think if one examines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the death tolls in those wars (e.g. the trench warfare or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the holocaust) one will observe that &quot;doing nothing&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially writing a prescription for millions of deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Doing the wrong thing causes even more deaths and likely puts 
<br>
off our favorite dreams for at least a generation AND unleashes 
<br>
a much higher likelihood of some of the nastier dystopias. 
<br>
Personally I consider any future that requires simply nuking 
<br>
entire countries out of existence to make &quot;the world safe for&quot; 
<br>
as a real dystopia.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So, to all &quot;extropians&quot;, I ask this question --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;how do we prevent millions of deaths?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>By confronting and ending the murderous idiocy within ourselves 
<br>
and by confronting and ending the roots of war as thoroughly and 
<br>
quickly as we can.
