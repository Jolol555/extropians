<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Why is this allowed? Because when an open society has totalitarian

<em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Aviation Leak and Spy Technology&quot;, according to a USAF major who was a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is also true in reverse.  The largest catagory of data analyzed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CIA is open-source (books, newspapers, and broadcast television).  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because a regime is totalitarian doesn't mean everything published or
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Lithuania doing a story about a local sailor being promoted and shipping off

<p>Below is a list of the current (as of 1995) FBIS (Foreign Broadcast
<br>

<br>
translated selected bits of information from magazines, newspapers, radio,

<br>
300 to 500 FBIS messages daily, all unclassified.  These were edited and

<p>Greek Authorities Said Fear CIA 'Black Ops,' Expect 17N To Suspend Activity
<br>
<p>GMP20010926000034
<br>
<p>Athens To Vima tis Kiriakis in Greek
<br>
23 Sep 01 p A23
<br>
<p>[Report by Dh. Nikolakopoulos: &quot;CIA and FBI 'Black Ops' in Greece&quot;]
<br>
<p>[FBIS Translated Text]
<br>
FBIS - Foreign Broadcast Information Service
<br>
<p>The CIA and the FBI will be free to organize black ops (assassinations
<br>
included), as well as assassinations, throughout the world (including
<br>
Greece.)   Their target would be to hunt down, arrest, and transport
<br>
members of terrorist groups (like &quot;17 November&quot;) to Washington to stand
<br>
trial.  In their opinion, these groups are acting against US national
<br>
security and interests.   These ops can be conducted without the knowledge
<br>
of our country's authorities, despite the counter-terrorism agreement
<br>
signed between the United States and Greece.
<br>
<p>Government executives believe that such a development is a real possibility
<br>
for the following two reasons:
<br>
<p>The first is US President Bush's decision to lift--within the context of
<br>
the US Government's measures for the country's protection from
<br>
terrorism--the presidential decree that was signed on 4 December 1981 by
<br>
then US President Reagan and which barred CIA activity abroad, mainly as
<br>
far as the
<br>
assassinations of foreign people and leaders were concerned.   The second
<br>
is Greece's designation by the US services as a country with intense
<br>
terrorist activity, mainly against the US interests.   This is something
<br>
that can be seen in official State Department annual reports on terrorism.
<br>
<p>The prospect of the CIA organizing &quot;black ops&quot; in Greece deeply concerns
<br>
the Greek Government.   The government was under intense pressure to
<br>
proceed to immediate arrests of people that the US secret services merely
<br>
suspected of being 17N members, even before the terrorist attack on New
<br>
York's twin towers.   It goes without saying that the US authorities did
<br>
not have the evidence required to take them to court.   US secret service
<br>
officials openly threatened in the past to make use of the classified
<br>
directive that became effective in January 1986 under Reagan, allowing the
<br>
CIA and the FBI to arrest terrorists abroad and transport them to the
<br>
United States to stand trial.
<br>
<p>The conduct of joint operations by the antiterrorist squad and the FBI to
<br>
apprehend members of the &quot;17N&quot; is today one of the conditions of the
<br>
counter-terrorism agreement signed between the United States and Greece.
<br>
This agreement in a way &quot;legitimized&quot; similar operations in the past,
<br>
designed to infiltrate the terrorist groups through the selling of weapons
<br>
and explosives--even though these operations ended up in fiascoes.
<br>
Furthermore, investigations took place in the houses of people suspected of
<br>
terrorist activity.
<br>
<p>Notwithstanding, government executives cannot even fathom that the US
<br>
secret services would organize on Greek soil unilateral &quot;black ops,&quot; or
<br>
even the murders of individuals thought--or even proved--to be members of
<br>
terrorist groups.   &quot;Such a development would be disastrous for the
<br>
democratic institutions and protection of the citizens' individual rights,&quot;
<br>
a government executive told To Vima.   He admits, however, that following
<br>
Black Tuesday in the United States, everything concerning the 17N
<br>
investigations has changed drastically.
<br>
<p>The new developments, in conjunction with the need to guarantee the
<br>
security of the 2004 Olympic Games--nobody doubts that the pressure will
<br>
become more intense in the future--are affecting the Greek Government's
<br>
decision to close the &quot;domestic front&quot; of terrorism at all cost.   This
<br>
means that 17N must either be disbanded or forced to suspend its activity.
<br>
<p>Government executives believe that a possible reappearance of 17 November
<br>
would become today a &quot;hammering ram&quot; against our country.   They are
<br>
apprehensive, however, of the authorities' ability to achieve immediate
<br>
results, namely to arrest and take to court members of the 17 November
<br>
group.   Despite this, the investigations have produced important evidence
<br>
that can bring about specific results in the fight against terrorism.
<br>
&quot;17N is not likely today to operate as it did in the past,&quot; they stress.
<br>
<p><p>They Expect a 17N Proclamation
<br>
<p>The Public Order Ministry officials are eagerly expecting the next
<br>
proclamation by 17 November, in which the group will be expressing its view
<br>
on the terrorist attack of 11 September on New York and the Pentagon.
<br>
They believe that this proclamation will be the first clear indication of
<br>
whether the 17N will follow--even under different circumstances--the
<br>
example of European terrorist groups like the RAF and suspend its
<br>
activity--at least temporarily.
