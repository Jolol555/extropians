<p>Yes, I think this is an excellent way of putting it, and one that
<br>
immediately brings to mind the question: Is this relation best examined from
<br>
an objective (as Eugen and Michael Butler seem to suggest) or a subjective
<br>
(Lee and Jonathan's take) point of reference? Or perhaps from some
<br>
satisfactory blend of the two:
<br>
<p><p>Subjective---------F---------Objective (con - pro)
<br>
<p><p>Where F is a hypothetical fulcrum/balance between the subjective i.e. (&quot;yes,
<br>
I think my life's been worthwhile&quot;) and a democratically determined
<br>
objective i.e. (&quot;these fucking defective clones are costing us a fortune to
<br>
treat and/or repair&quot; - &quot;hey, clones are okey-dokey with me&quot;)
<br>
<p>Obviously F cannot possibly be resolved at least until such time as the
<br>
first clone is able to comprehend the basic question: &quot;Are you glad we made
<br>
you?&quot;
<br>
<p>Therefore I have to say I'm with Shermer in saying - lets run the
<br>
experiment.
<br>
<p>On another track, I seriously think some cryonics organization (Alcor?)
<br>
ought to consider the costs vs. benefits of publicly announcing that clone
<br>
Eve shall receive a gratis suspension if things should go tragically wrong,
<br>
or she reaches an age where suicide becomes a conceptual and desirable
<br>
option. And wouldn't that cause an ethical firestorm if a clone should one
<br>
day *demand* the right to an assisted &quot;suicide&quot; in order to obtain a very
<br>
high quality suspension.
