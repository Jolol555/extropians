Kai observed:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Exactly. That's why I don't buy any &quot;we have to bring freedom and 
<br>
democracy&quot; arguments regarding the Iraq. I'd gladly accept a worldwide 
<br>
campaign for freedom and democracy, and I would praise the US if they'd 
<br>
lead that campaign. After the middle-east, North Korea would be on my 
<br>
list, as well as several regions in Africa. Such an initiative could 
<br>
perhaps even push China - if we could achieve a worldwide embargo for 
<br>
example. Unfortunately, not many regimes care for moral, when profit is 
<br>
at stake. Together with my impression that there's no real present danger 
<br>
yet (see my other mails), I therefore tend to look for other reasons for 
<br>
Mr Bushs war monging.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, a lot of conservative politicians like to wrap themselves in the flag. 
<br>
This is pretty well known in the USA and to be expected. Honesty is more 
<br>
refreshing and important, I believe. Had Bush stated: &quot;we are in this for 
<br>
revenge, punish, and a warning&quot;; with some convincing, the vast majority of 
<br>
the American people would have come along anyway. 
<br>
<p>Also it seems that if one waits until a clear and present danger arrives; the 
<br>
ONLY solution is war, because negotiation is out the door.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;IIRC, Morgenthaus plan was to knock down all industrial equipment in 
<br>
Germany and make it a agriculture-only country, so that no military 
<br>
infrastructure could ever be developed here.&gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>I am guessing that 2/3rds of Germans would've have enjoyed it, nevertheless. 
<br>
A bucolic lifestyle might have been more therapeutic, especially right after 
<br>
a murderous and murdering war!  But since the Marshall Plan was chosen, we 
<br>
might be talking about an alternate history fiction.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;That's clearly not the way Schröder thinks :-) He's also not overly 
<br>
pacifistic. In the evening of 9-11-2001, he officially announced that 
<br>
Germany would provide &quot;unreserved solidarity&quot; to the US and AFAIK, he has 
<br>
kept his word.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Such throw away statements by politicians, from whatever nation, must be 
<br>
familiar to everyone. The are not to be taken seriously.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The socialdemocratic/green coalition has been the first 
<br>
government of Germany who send german soldiers into actual battles, first 
<br>
in former Yugoslavia, then in Afghanistan. That wasn't easy in a land, 
<br>
where grantparents and even parents narrations about war times don't 
<br>
tell about heroism, but about death, hunger, displacement and the loss of 
<br>
friends and belongings.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The world changes and we all must change with it. I voted for Al Gore, in the 
<br>
last election, and now, because of foreign policy events; will not soon 
<br>
consider voting for the Democrats again.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Isn't this more a problem of information? We know there's plenty of money 
<br>
in that region, but it's in the hand of a small elite. But what do the 
<br>
people there know? Remember the very limited sources of information in 
<br>
Iraq. You'll meet 23mio. people who think you are the spurce of all evil, 
<br>
because you have deprived them of food, medicaments, etc., because the 
<br>
official propaganda says so. How many Iraqis know about the UN, the ABC 
<br>
weapons? According to a german news program last week, many Iaqis still 
<br>
believe than Iran had attacked them in the eighties, because propaganda 
<br>
says so.
<br>
   Kai &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The best propaganda is the truth. The DE-Nazification program, and the 
<br>
demilitarization program in Japan; worked only because these were conquered 
<br>
nations.
<br>
One the original governments were defeated; people could decide for 
<br>
themselves based on news services. My guess is such news services 
<br>
intentionally, and unintentionally, provide propaganda; but that post WW2 
<br>
propaganda was much, much, closer to the truth then the previous regimes.
