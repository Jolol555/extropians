Rafal noted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;### The total land area of the US is 9,158,960 sq km. It would be easy to
<br>
use a million square miles for windfarms.
<br>
Rafal&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ok. Converting 9,158,960 square klicks into mental miles = 33% X 9,158,960  
<br>
or rather kilometers to kilometers. 
<br>
<p>So we add it 3022456.8, to the 9 mil figure, bringing in into the 12 million 
<br>
range. 12 Million kilometers, that is. So windfarms would use 1/11th of the 
<br>
land surface of the US? That's a huge chunk of landspace. You don't suppose 
<br>
that people would end up filing lawsuits against any company that needed to 
<br>
use such land for wind power, do you? I am not sure the author I quoted from 
<br>
on the National Review is correct, but it seems thought provoking. 
<br>
<p>A lot of the mentality promoting solar power, for example, and declaiming 
<br>
nuclear fission (perhaps rightly) seems based on propaganda that has choruses 
<br>
of women singing sweetly, as wide-angle shots of the sun, in a clear morning 
<br>
sky. This is far less emphasis given to solar research around the world, 
<br>
which would involve solar cell manufacture techniques, inorganic chemistry 
<br>
studies, and fuel cell analyses.
<br>
<p>One further factoid, is that Mr. Ballard, Ceo of Ballard Engineering in Van 
<br>
Couver, BC, has come out on record, stating the need for nuclear fission 
<br>
plants, in order to convert water into hydrogen for his automotive fuel 
<br>
cells.
