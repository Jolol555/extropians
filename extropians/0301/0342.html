[Hal Finney]
<br>
&lt;And to close the circle, if everything exists it doesn't
<br>
make sense to ask whether existence is better than non-existence,
<br>
because there is no such thing as non-existence.  It may still
<br>
be possible to do as in the case of the MWI and define a &quot;measure&quot;
<br>
function over the entities that exist, and then to work in terms
<br>
of probabilities for these entities, in terms of what fraction of
<br>
the &quot;multiverse&quot; they occupy.&gt;
<br>
<p>Lev Vaidman wrote that we must care about all our 'successive' 
<br>
worlds in proportion to their measures of existence [Behavior 
<br>
Principle]. He does not agree to play the 'quantum Russian 
<br>
roulette' because the measure of existence of worlds with 
<br>
himself dead (or poor) is be much larger than the measure 
<br>
of existence of the worlds with himself alive (and rich!).
<br>
<p>But is the MWI weird enough to hold, to keep 'everything'?
<br>
<p>Let us take Feynman 'literaly'. A particle moves from a point
<br>
to another along 'all possible' paths, with the least action
<br>
path of classical mechanics being the classical limit. Let us
<br>
allow particles to go both directions in time. For all paths,
<br>
to be visualized as happening simultaneously, we 'might' have
<br>
a particle going 'back and forth in time', along these paths.
<br>
All Feynman paths contribute to a single event. With time reversal,
<br>
we can 'see' how this can happen in reality.
<br>
<p>Now let us talk about the famous 'double slit' interference 
<br>
experiment. We can say that a particle (photon, electron, neutron, 
<br>
and the C-60-fullerene) goes through one slit, then goes 'back 
<br>
in time' through the same slit, and then forward through the other 
<br>
slit.
<br>
<p>Thus, we can imagine the 'same' photon as appearing 'simultaneously'
<br>
at both slits. In Feynman diagrams all contribute to a single event. 
<br>
With time reversal, we can visualize how this can happen in 'reality'.
<br>
<p>The above is - in principle - a different weird possibility.
<br>
<p>[Hal Finney]
<br>
&lt;Another reason has to do with the anthropic principle. [...].
<br>
It seems that you need some foundation of multiple universes 
<br>
like this to invoke the anthropic principle, otherwise it doesn't 
<br>
really have explanatory value.&gt;
<br>
<p>I agree. But 'if' MWI requires 'in principle' an observer, can we
<br>
use the antropic principle within the MWI? Is not that a tautology? 
<br>
<p>s.
