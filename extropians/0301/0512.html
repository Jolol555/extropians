</em><br>
<p>OK, I see your point.  If Quaoar was a planet, its name would be
<br>
inconsistent with other planetary names.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Juno would be perfect, even fitting in with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern requirements as the goddess of childbirth.
</em><br>
<p>One of the &quot;big four&quot; asteroids in the Ceres asteroid belt is already named
<br>
Juno.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do like your logic though. As a matter of humour, perhaps Pluto should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change it's name when within Neptune's orbit and when beyond it.
</em><br>
<p>My logic was from the official naming conventions for solar system objects.
<br>
None of these ideas were original with me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All I can say is that the newspaper headlines across the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Quaoar - new Kuiper Belt object discovered&quot; but &quot;Quaoar - new planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered&quot;. At least the six or seven articles I read said that.
</em><br>
<p>Do you have any specific examples?  Catching news reports making basic
<br>
scientific mistakes is a hobby of mine.  I haven't seen any that claimed
<br>
Quaoar was a planet.  I did see a lot that claimed it was &quot;almost&quot; a planet.
<br>
The way the news released stated that this 'plutino' was almost a planet
<br>
lead many subsequent reports to refer to the planetoid with the name
<br>
&quot;Plutino&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I should check what the Chinese call their planets. The question of naming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (original, translated, and applied) is wickedly interesting.
</em><br>
<p>All cultures and languages I know of seem to have considered the planets to
<br>
be deities and hence had deity names from their culture.
