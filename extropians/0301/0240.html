Extropes,

<p>&quot;...if you look in the newspaper files of any large
<br>
public library and examine the newspapers of the mid
<br>
and late fifties you will find ample proof that
<br>
multitudes of people fled the totalitarian north due
<br>
to the suppression of Ho Chi Minh and his helpers.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then Damien, in a later post:
<br>
<p>&quot;Without taking a position, however, on the substance
<br>
of Ron's comment, it would be interesting to know how
<br>
many of those fleeing from atheistic communists were
<br>
Catholics.&quot; 
<br>
<p>To which Ron replied:
<br>
<p>&quot;Damien, it would be interesting to notice if you paid
<br>
attention to constant stream of reports of murder
<br>
instead of seizing immediately upon the ad hominem
<br>
argument that we were sypathetic to Roman Catholics. 
<br>
Those people voted with their feet in hordes.  Do you
<br>
suppose they were looking for a Roman Catholic Mass
<br>
and if so why was it being denied them in the North?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------
<br>
<p>Interesting exchange.  Seems to involve to some degree
<br>
the issue of refugees from North Vietnam after the
<br>
peace accords of 1954.  Perhaps a fact or two to flesh
<br>
out the mental picture of the real events.  
<br>
<p>But before I give you the link, may I suggest a moment
<br>
taken to review your current inventory of fact on this
<br>
matter.  What do you really know?  What is your total
<br>
exposure to facts  regarding refugee
<br>
movements/relocations in Vietnam in '54-'55?  If it is
<br>
little more than a vague recollection that, &quot;in fear
<br>
for their lives, they fled the horror of communism&quot;,
<br>
without a single real fact as far as the eye can see,
<br>
can your fairly characterize as rational any
<br>
impression that you might have on the matter?  Be
<br>
fair, now.
<br>
<p>Here's the link:

<br>
<p>...to a condensed version/excerpts from:
<br>
<p>B.S.N. Murti, Vietnam Divided: The Unfinished
<br>
Struggle. London: Asia Publishing House, 1964. 
<br>
<p>Do a &quot;search in page&quot; for &quot;Refugees from the North&quot;. 
<br>
What follows is a highly-detailed description of the
<br>
events referred to above.

<p>You will read
<br>
<p>Author Profile: The author was Assistant Secretary to
<br>
India's Congress Party in the Central Legislature
<br>
(1944-48).
<br>
<p>After the partition of Vietnam, B.S.N. Murti was a
<br>
member of the Indian delegation charged with the
<br>
implementation of Geneva Accords.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Book Review: &quot;An excellent insight to the problems
<br>
posed by the partition and the relocation of Catholics
<br>
from the North to the South, and the Viet Minh from
<br>
the South to the North. Murti was obviously pleased
<br>
with how the transfer went and gives a good
<br>
description of what the atmosphere was like at this
<br>
tense time. It appears that the Indian peace-keepers
<br>
sided with those from Poland in looking favourably on
<br>
the North, while the Canadians were more sympathetic
<br>
to the South&quot;.  
<br>
<p>The peacekeepers referred to above were the Canadian,
<br>
Indian, and Polish, riff-raff charged with the
<br>
implementation of the Geneva Accords.

<br>
<p>Now, for those who have toiled along this far, a small
<br>
reward.  Convinced that this poster takes this matter
<br>
waaaay too seriously?  For some ***really***
<br>
interesting reading, check this out...
<br>
<p>Now honestly, when you see the picture of Avro, how
<br>
seriously are you inclined towards what follows?

<br>
<p>The Shocking Story of the Catholic &quot;Church's&quot; Role in
<br>
Starting the Vietnam War
<br>
<p>By Avro Manhattan
<br>
<p>About the author:
<br>
<p>Avro Manhattan was the world's foremost authority on
<br>
Roman Catholicism in politics. A resident of London,
<br>
during WW II he operated a radio station called &quot;Radio
<br>
Freedom&quot; broadcasting to occupied Europe. He was the
<br>
author of over 20 books including the best-seller The
<br>
Vatican in World Politics, twice Book-of-the-Month and
<br>
going through 57 editions. He was a Great Briton who
<br>
risked his life daily to expose some of the darkest
<br>
secrets of the Papacy. His books were #1 on the
<br>
Forbidden Index for the past 50 years!!
<br>
<p>Look particularly at chapter eight, The Virgin Mary
<br>
Goes South, at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.reformation.org/chapter8.html">http://www.reformation.org/chapter8.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------- 
<br>
<p>For a combination super-chuckle and Kafka-esque
<br>
&quot;hmmmmmmmmm&quot;, if you search the Murti piece for the
<br>
phrase &quot;atomic attack&quot;.  You will find this paragraph:
<br>
<p>&quot;There was general panic in the North as the situation
<br>
was so confused and the people's minds were dominated
<br>
by fear. Added to this, the herd instinct in them
<br>
played a prominent part. Most of the people left
<br>
because their neighbors in the village left and their
<br>
leaders and priests left and asked them to leave. A
<br>
large number of people decided to leave because of a
<br>
vague fear of atomic attack on the North. The
<br>
International Commission's Teams came across a great
<br>
number of people who really believed that if they
<br>
remained in the North, the Americans would drop atom
<br>
bombs.&quot;
<br>
<p>I direct your attention to the word &quot;really&quot;, above. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Then, if you search &quot;chapter eight, The Virgin Mary
<br>
Goes South&quot;, you will find this:
<br>
<p>&quot;[Caption to photo]Catholics fleeing North Vietnam,
<br>
following the intense religious and political
<br>
propaganda from the South. They were told that if they
<br>
stayed under a Communist atheistic government they
<br>
would be atom bombed out of existence and they would
<br>
lose their souls. Catholic President Diem wished to
<br>
create economic and political disruption to the North
<br>
with an accelerated population dislocation. Catholic
<br>
priests and the South Vietnamese radio declared that
<br>
the Virgin Mary and even her Son, Jesus Christ, had
<br>
gone to South Vietnam to live under Catholic Diem.
<br>
Ultimately three-quarters of a million North
<br>
Vietnamese Catholics fled their homes and villages
<br>
within a few months. The authorities in the North
<br>
tried to stop the human flood but were helpless
<br>
against the religious emotionalism used by the
<br>
Catholics of South Vietnam.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------
<br>
<p>I love the internet.  You flat out can't get this kind
<br>
of entertainment from TV.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------------
<br>
<p>The history of Catholicism in Indochina is complex.  A
<br>
superficial familiarity with the events of the Vienam
<br>
War era at first led me to suspect that the Catholics
<br>
were a comprador class created by the French during
<br>
their time there.  That's not far off, but there's a
<br>
bit more to it than that, dating back to 1535, and the
<br>
arrival in the far east of the first Portuguese
<br>
missionaries.
<br>

<br>
Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who
<br>
said it--no matter if I have said it--unless it agrees
<br>
with your own reason and your common sense.&quot;
