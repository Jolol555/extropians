<em>&gt; Well, yes, death is bad.  And war, which involves lots of death, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very bad.  But there are worse things, like suffering and slavery.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And there are times when the application of deadly violence /saves/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives.  Avoiding war is a noble sentiment.  But avoiding a war that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is needed to free an enslaved people, or avoiding a war that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to stop a genocide or a conquest, is elevating the sentiment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above reason.  And the idea that war is never necessary to do those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things is not rationally supportable.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's why when Bush said he was not interested in nation-building, 
<br>
he lost any chance of my sympathy.  The Marshall Plan is one of the few 
<br>
cases I can think of where war worked historically.  I'd still be very 
<br>
nervous around war just on general principles, but at least it's something 
<br>
where, a few past times in history, there was a positive result.  There'd 
<br>
be a *hope* of it being for the best.
<br>
<p>Iraq will get a new dictator.  A few years later we'll probably have the 
<br>
same problem all over again.  That seems to be the most common result of 
<br>
modern wars.  Plenty of rubble, but no liberal democracies rising out of 
<br>
the ashes.  Is that worth a war?  It's hard to see why.
<br>
<p>If there's a liberal democracy in Afghanistan in ten years, maybe I'll say 
<br>
that something worthwhile took place there.  But I'd bet on theocracy or 
<br>
kleptocracy.
<br>
<p>The only good argument I can think of in favor of invading Iraq, North 
<br>
Korea, and whoever's next, is that in five years we may be playing this 
<br>
little scenario over again with rogue development of nanotechnology.  So 
<br>
someone inside the White House decided to just say the hell with 
<br>
international law and get rid of all the perennial menaces that were never 
<br>
quite annoying enough to squash before.  But if that were the case, I'd 
<br>
expect Bush to be as polite and conciliatory as possible internationally 
<br>
to minimize that fallout.  This feels... I don't know.  Either the US is 
<br>
being really, really stupid, or someone is playing this game with really 
<br>
evil goals, or I've totally failed to comprehend what's going on.  I wish 
<br>
I had a few years experience in international diplomacy; I might be able 
<br>
to figure out what's going on then.
