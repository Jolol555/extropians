Colonel Qaddafi is no supporter of human rights. Both human rights, war crimes and genocide are issues that have not been fully institutionally addressed by the West, which prefers to deal with such on a case by case basis - or ignore such.
<br>
<p>Qaddafi's white-suited son has been touring Australia, smiling sweetly.
<br>
<p>I remember one thing Qaddafi did was broadcast on tv live executions of people who were strangled with wire.
<br>
<p>An acquaintance of mine who claimed to have met him after doing some engineering related work for Libya said the encounter was interesting. He was in the tent and Qaddafi had taken LSD. This guy started describing how the project was going and Qaddafi asked what his sources of inspiration were. Without thinking he said the US, Australia and Israel. When he said the word Israel Quaddafi went crazy. This guy was frogmarched at submachinegun point to the airport and that was the end of his involvement in the engineering venture.
