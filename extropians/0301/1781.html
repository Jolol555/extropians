What I meant is that where the wind farms are located... the great plains of
<br>
the USA and prairies of Canada the water is not abundant.  In these areas all
<br>
available water is put to some use.  That is if you want to split water, cool
<br>
it to liquid hydrogen or convert it to hydrides or bucky-tube conglomerates for
<br>
shipment   to large population centers.  To get water in those areas would
<br>
necessitate removing it from a hydrated source such as plant tissues.
<br>
<p>EX- take  acres of various ag crops that have uses as dry pelleted or
<br>
fractionated dehydrated
<br>
components.  Water then is available.  Add wind farms in substantial quantities
<br>
for on or near site
<br>
electricity.  Split the captured water, ship the primary/secondary production
<br>
utilizing hydrogen powered trucks.  Use power to provide cooling to liquify the
<br>
hydrogen.  The heat side of that equation could run the dehydration side of the
<br>
equation.  By products= electricity to grid, hydrogen fuel, bio-products of
<br>
numerous types.  The bio-products utilize the solar input component.
<br>
The limiting factor is the water.  Without integrating novel sources such as
<br>
above you have raw power that has to be put into a grid and exported to a water
<br>
source such as a city with sources of waste water that are not required by
<br>
up-stream communities.  In the end to grow  the equation by several orders of
<br>
magnitude  we need global warming to liberate the polar cap ice over a 50-200
<br>
year period.  During this period systems and infrastructure to hold this
<br>
quantity of water in various bio and chemical forms can be built up.  This
<br>
senario would support a much larger world population  as well.

</em><br>
