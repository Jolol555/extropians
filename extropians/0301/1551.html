<p>I want to expand on Mitch's answer (<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=RE:%20Iraq:%20the%20case%20for%20decisive%20action">Spudboy100@aol.com</a>).
<br>
<p>No, Kai, Mike had it exactly right.  If you talk to most
<br>
Japanese today, they will readily agree that their prior
<br>
to WWII way of doing things was wrong.  They'll readily
<br>
agree that rule by law and democracy is better than their
<br>
former militarism.
<br>
<p>Of course, there are a few die-hards even today, who would
<br>
much rather that Japan had prevailed in the war and who
<br>
still sulk over that defeat.  Perhaps as about as many
<br>
as the southerners in the U.S. who still resent the northern
<br>
victory, or Germans who wish that Hitler had won.  No, the
<br>
vast majority of Japanese, Germans, and U.S. southerners
<br>
underwent what Mike called &quot;a state of cognitive shock
<br>
occurring in the minds of the populace that allows the
<br>
dislodging of a belief system from their minds&quot;, to paraphrase
<br>
slightly.
<br>
<p>Suppose that Nazi Germany had won the war, and that I was
<br>
bi-lingual in English and German.  There is little doubt
<br>
that Americans today would see the &quot;folly&quot; of representative
<br>
government and the correctness of Nazi beliefs, and a version
<br>
of you would be writing this letter to a version of me, instead
<br>
of the other way around.  (And hopefully, I'd have the insight
<br>
to understand that yes, this is how history works.)
