<p>Fun paper. 
<br>
<p>Hmm, one could run the EV mirror system with the lotto results. Instead 
<br>
of the bomb, place a LCD display showing the result where the photon 
<br>
would be blocked if the numbers fitted your guess. Then detector D2 
<br>
would start to chime if you won. I guess this is what you were after? 
<br>
With the quantum Zeno effect the probability of getting the right 
<br>
response without actually sending a photon through the LCD can be made 
<br>
arbitrarily close to 1. 
<br>
<p>I think reasoning in terms of fauxtons is risky; to really analyse what
<br>
happes one has to do a computation of probability amplitudes in terms of
<br>
strict QM. One cannot safely use the interpretations of it to find out
<br>
what would happen. 
<br>
<p>I'm not good enough with bra's and ket's to calculate what happens; it 
<br>
seems that there is room for some weirdness here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You still need the photons to get to the photographic film to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something measurable, so they will have to take the day to pass down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beam path.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, I guess so, in which case there's no obvious way to *use* such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect. Sigh. (Unless Elitzur/Vaidman etc, cited above, helps out...)
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so, unfortunately. On the other hand, if one exploits the 
<br>
uncertainty in *where* the slit is and hopes for something like the 
<br>
FTL-tunneling effect to save us. But I doubt the universe is *that* fun.
