I think there has been some commentary on the effects of cutting down most of the trees. This must also have an effect on moisture patterns and reflection patterns, to say the least. But all of this is in the context of this period being the end of the 2nd 10 millenium interglacial of the 100,000 year glacial (you remember the 1st major interglacial... that was when we started to paint). Glacial conditions have effects on moisture too.

<p>Hold on... what about some crazed geneticist designing an organic wind farm? Flaps instead of rotors? Leaves that spin? Trees that convert wind to electricity? Make them big so they stand out...
<br>
<p>Still, hydrogen or no, personally I reckon make the road surfaces (or at least strips on them) into nano-solar power collectors. Try and make them power the cars and houses directly from the road. Superconductors? Plus either microwave or superconductor or just high-quality cable electricity down a space tower from orbital solar power stations (can diamondoid-style materials protect advanced solar cells from damage from orbital conditions?).
<br>
<p>I guess if worst comes to worst we'll just have to grow petrol in plants. I've already posted links to some Australian work on growing oil in plants. Then we can have electric cars powered from oil-driven power plants with Stirling engines.

</em><br>
