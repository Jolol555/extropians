<em>&gt; &gt; Suppose a grown phocomelus wishes to have a child just like

<p><em>&gt; 1. Is her course of conduct right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I have long had a hunch that this is exactly the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    question to ask.  It brings bad memes and patterns of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    thinking into play.
</em><br>
<p>You missed the frame here: I was responding within the context that Hal's
<br>
post had set up; he wrote:
<br>
<p>&lt; In my experience we move too quickly from the question of what is right
<br>
to the question of what is allowed.  These are very difficult and complex
<br>
issues, but all too soon we are trying to decide the matter not only for
<br>
ourselves, but for our neighbors as well. [...]
<br>
<p>&lt; I would encourage people to step back from the question of what should be
<br>
allowed and to try to focus the discourse on questions of what personal
<br>
actions we would choose in various circumstances. &gt;
<br>
<p>That is, Hal explicitly asked us to consider what actions are right, rather
<br>
than what are lawful or `allowed'. Of course there is an immense body of
<br>
ethical philosophy concerning these topics, the words we deploy in dealing
<br>
them, the values and strategies implied by those words, etc etc.
