<p><em>&gt; &gt;(My dominant societies theory may have just been a natural random occurrence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of creative thought? or was it a reaction to some environmental stimulus?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think your thesis is an interesting one, and I strongly suggest you look 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up Jared Diamond's &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the greatest book from which to begin all inquiries of this sort.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He comes up with a number of theories that explain why some societies do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better than others, including geography, access to resources, and most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importantly, access to data. He shows quite convincingly that the most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful and creative societies in history were those that interacted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regularly and openly with neighboring societies and exchanged information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and technologies.
</em><br>
<p>No less than three (3!) books recently and soon to be read
<br>
by my book discussion group emphasizes two additional
<br>
extremely important characteristics that separate prosperous
<br>
powerful societies from the non-functional:
<br>
<p>1. High regard for and protection of individual rights
<br>
2. Reliable safeguards and legal rights protecting private property.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>See &quot;The Elusive Quest for Growth&quot;, by William Easterly,
<br>
&quot;The Noblest Triumph&quot;, by Tom Bethell, and &quot;Power and
<br>
Prosperity&quot; by Mancur Olsen.  Very perceptive and informative
<br>
books all.
<br>
<p>Mancur Olsen writes, near the end of his book, speaking of
<br>
two conditions that he has spend 194 pages so far explaining,
<br>
<p>&quot;As we have seen, the first of these conditions is the paradoxical
<br>
condition of secure and well-defined individual rights.  Rather
<br>
than being a luxury that only rich countries can afford,
<br>
individual rights are essential to obtaining the vast gains
<br>
from the sophisticated transactions described in Chapter 9....&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The second condition required for a thriving market economy
<br>
is simply the absence of predation of any kind.  Some predation,
<br>
such as that which occurs in the war of each against all in
<br>
a Hobbesian anarchy, or that undertaken when autocrats or
<br>
other governments abrogate the rights of their subjects by
<br>
confiscating property or repudiating contracts, is already
<br>
excluded if the rights hold that are emphasized here, so we
<br>
not need to list it separately.
<br>
<p>&quot;But one other kind of predation can and often does occur even
<br>
in societies with the best individual rights.  This is predation
<br>
through lobbying that obtains special-interest legislation or
<br>
regulation and through cartelization or collusion to fix prices
<br>
or wages.  As the argument outlined in Chapter 4 shows, 
<br>
collective action to lobby or to fix prices generates a
<br>
benefit that goes to everyone in an industry, occupation,
<br>
or group, whether or not the individual or firm in question
<br>
has made a contribution to the lobbying or price fixing.
<br>
Because of this incentive to free ride, it takes a long time
<br>
for collecting action to emerge in most industries or groups,
<br>
so only societies that are stable for some time have many
<br>
coalitions for collective action.&quot;
<br>
<p>Olson cites this process as crucial to explaining the
<br>
economic demise of the Soviet Union, which, when it was
<br>
young, had the ability (through purges, mainly) to
<br>
resist collusions occurring at many levels.  But he
<br>
also presents a good case that our democracies also
<br>
are undergoing a very similar &quot;sclerosis&quot;, with the
<br>
most discouraging prospects.
