<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, there is an emerging body of civil law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in &quot;wrongful birth&quot; suits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Complete insanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How so?  Never come into being is much better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living a life of constant misery. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree totally.  I'm just skeptical that these people
<br>
are leading lives of &quot;constant misery&quot;.  I seriously
<br>
doubt that they *really* wish they'd never been born.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But for the person with defects, e.g. me, to be anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but extraordinarily grateful that he got to live is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stupid and silly.  Apparently people, if they're honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, some of those with defects are so extraordinarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grateful [sarcasm] that they're stupid and silly enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to die of such defects, or commit suicide because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't stand the pain.
</em><br>
<p>I agree totally, again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and not just out for a fast buck, who file such law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suits against their parents don't realize that a blemish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free version of them would be someone else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh? They wouldn't be there to start with. That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole point: if life is hell it's better it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never started.  Being dumb about it is somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more excusable than actual malice aforethought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it still leaves us with one not exactly happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; camper on our hands.
</em><br>
<p>If their suit is directed towards one bad gene,
<br>
then they're talking about a version of themselves
<br>
without that gene.
<br>
<p>Now if they really would be better off dead, then
<br>
they've got three great options:  (1) kill themselves
<br>
(2) hope for improved treatment for what ails them (3)
<br>
get frozen in order to try to ride out the bad part.
<br>
These options would not exist if their parents had
<br>
not given birth to them.  To accuse the parents of
<br>
this absurd &quot;wrongful birth&quot;---especially as it 
<br>
occurred many years before modern understanding of
<br>
genetics was widespread---is totally absurd.
<br>
<p>Yes, but this &quot;not exactly happy camper&quot; on &quot;our&quot;
<br>
hands should have available by now many therapies
<br>
only our ignorance and superstition has prevented
<br>
us from developing.  www.hedweb.com
