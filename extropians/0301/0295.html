<em>&gt;From what I understand, Natasha doesn't mean that Exi has no principles, no
</em><br>
positions, in a political climate. It's got a function as a kind of lobby
<br>
group, after all.
<br>
<p>I interpreted Natasha's statements as saying in particular that Exi has no
<br>
political affiliations. eg: it has no association with any formal
<br>
Libertarian groups. Further, even though many Extropians might be
<br>
libertarian, or social democrat, or conservative, these leanings are
<br>
orthogonal to being Extropian, and Exi in turn has no bias in the political
<br>
dimension, as it does not involve itself in such.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean that it couldn't talk about having political opponents,
<br>
couldn't lobby political groups, or otherwise engage in the political
<br>
landscape in representing Extropy. It's just that it is not a political
<br>
party in and of itself, and doesn't desire to be.
<br>
<p>But I could be wrong. :-)

<em>&gt; Subject: ExI in a world of politics (was Re: Memes.org: Transhumanism:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The New Master Race? M)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From Natasha:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My .....concern with this list has been over the many years to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; diffuse ........the wrongful claims made by some people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ExI is a political organization, which it is NOT and claims no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular affiliation with ANY one political mindset, platform 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or organization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, it seems to me that politics is not something that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can always choose to avoid. If a group has a name, the name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be used to make a political target of the group or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisation, regardless of whether that group thinks of itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a political organisation or not. (This is analogous I think to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old compete or cooperate fundamental choice. I may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  *want* to be competitive. But if someone chooses to compete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against me, they *can* remove the option of my cooperating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with them and effectively make me either compete or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconditionally surrender. Effectively they can *make* me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compete). Is it not similarly the case that ExI, although it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not see itself as a political organisation, and may not wish to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a political organisation, could be forced to act politically if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone or some organisation treats it politically? Perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks it or misrepresents it?
