<br>
Because I'm honestly missing the point of why a person with Ron's background 
<br>
and Ron's beliefs would find this list worthwhile. He might be not with 
<br>
Sauron, but he's certainly with Isengard.
<br>
<p>Eugen, perhaps you need to widen your world view.  If you will examine your 
<br>
statement above you made one factual statement.  You said, &quot;alright&quot; in 
<br>
response to the charge you started it.  Otherwise your email is one long list 
<br>
of personal attacks.  Speaking for myself, I think the extropian list 
<br>
contains the highest percentage of widely knowledgeable people that I have 
<br>
ever encountered.  You might ask what I am comparing the Extropian list to -- 
<br>
I graduated two of the US's top twenty five universities, Washington 
<br>
University of St. Louis, Mo., and the University of Chicago.  In addition I 
<br>
have attended Mensa Meetings and was in a couple of elite units 
<br>
(intellectually) in the service.  So, you can see I am placing Extropy in 
<br>
some pretty good company but then saying Extropy outranks them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do love good debate.  That is one of the things I like about 
<br>
Extropy.  I can ask and find out other views than my own.  I can contribute 
<br>
factually.  If I am off base I get my ears pinned back.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this constant drumbeat of personal comments from a few does 
<br>
disturb me.  As much as anything it bothers me that I get a little snippy in 
<br>
response.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of all it bothers me that you live in a world of such fear.  Why? 
<br>
&nbsp;There is nothing to fear.  We are a strong and honest people.  We will take 
<br>
care of the Al Qaida, we will take care of Sadaam Hussein and we will take 
<br>
care of the Patriot Act.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully at some point we can settle down to pursue the interests of 
<br>
Extropy.  That was my initial interest in this group.   
<br>
Sincerely
<br>
Ron h.
