</em><br>
<p>### I tend to agree with you, Daniel, that judgment should be applied
<br>
instead of force in matters of speech. The current system, allowing a party
<br>
to extract damages from a slanderer, is in my opinion wrong. However, there
<br>
are some circumstances where human judgment may be prevented from acting.
<br>
One such situation is when a large organization, possibly in control of a
<br>
media conglomerate, deliberately spreads lies about a smaller party, perhaps
<br>
a person, perhaps an unpopular minority. There may be a significant
<br>
imbalance in their ability to reach public opinion, and a substantial
<br>
positive feedback could come into play - a lie becomes much more credible if
<br>
enough people start believing it, as the success of the green movement
<br>
shows.
<br>
<p>While I agree with you that the use of force to suppress speech, even
<br>
malicious lies, is probably counterproductive, I think that there is a way
<br>
of evening out the odds, without suppression of speech - &quot;Audiatur et altera
<br>
pars&quot;. If a jury finds a statement to be materially false, to a sufficient
<br>
standard of certainty, then the aggrieved party should have the right to
<br>
demand from the slanderer the publication the jury's findings, in a medium
<br>
commensurate with the medium where the slanderous material initially was
<br>
placed (but not as a retraction, merely as an opinion of a respected third
<br>
party). In this way the credibility of the slanderer would be diminished,
<br>
without suppression of speech. This would discourage malicious lying as well
<br>
as current law, but without the same chilling effect on e.g. speech directed
<br>
against the Scientologists. A better balance would be possible.
