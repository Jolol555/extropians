<p><em>&gt; I tend to agree with Max M and Reason.  Since there is no central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authorization or umbrella for transhumanity, a tendancy for a weak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repository of info happens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ExI could easily cultivate a link-a-link directory of virtual and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real time locations for transhumanists, seminars, university courses, etc.
</em><br>
Its
<br>
<em>&gt; data/design would be open source and easily duplicated and disbursed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sites.
</em><br>
<p>Which would duplicate many such things that already exist. That's not quite
<br>
what I was driving at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However - &quot;all places are one place&quot; is far to collectivist for me and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think that would work.  Rather, a better freeway design than what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have now which are the basic net search engines.  I like Kurtzweil's site
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design and I've asked Max if we can do something similar in regards to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist areas of interest.  I'll ask Amara about it as well.
</em><br>
<p>I think you miss the point; my goal is not to create repositories. It's to
<br>
increase cultural links and exchange of information between comparitively
<br>
isolated communities with transhumanist memes or interests. The technologist
<br>
way of looking at this is to build better freeways AND CONVEYORS to move
<br>
information right up under the noses of people who will not go out and look
<br>
for it.
<br>
<p>(Better search engines are not the answer for community building; relying on
<br>
human volition from the masses to build bigger and more effective
<br>
communities doesn't work. The information has to be brought to them and made
<br>
available in the places they normally visit).
<br>
<p>Centralization or central control are not goals. You can't sell that to
<br>
webmasters. The only central point in the technical solution is a server
<br>
that replicates traffic in a convenient way, but doesn't store anything.
<br>
Repositories are distributed, just as they always were -- it's just that
<br>
they all contain overlapping information (i.e. imperfect copies of each
<br>
other). Participation is voluntary from webmasters/forum owners -- but it's
<br>
advantageous to jump in, so they should be fairly easy to convince.
<br>
Everything continues as before, except that each new niche community
<br>
directly and meaningfully adds to the overall metacommunity.
<br>
<p>In theory, this means that we gain some fraction of the advantages of having
<br>
a much larger community, rather than many small ones. In practice, it really
<br>
remains to be seen how effective this would be. The work isn't in the tech,
<br>
it's in managing the wetware assemblages for this sort of thing.
