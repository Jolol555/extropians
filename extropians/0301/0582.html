<p>
Thank you all for your suggestions.  I have made a decision and your advice
<br>
was very much appreciated.  We had a low turnout on our last reading so I am
<br>
trying to get the twenty or so people in the book club suitably excited
<br>
about this new offering.  You will find below the email I used to introduce
<br>
the subject to the club ... hopefully it gets them reading...
<br>
<p>&quot;The moment is here, the waiting, the endless dreaming and desiring, the
<br>
unquenchable thirst to know - all of this will soon be over, for within this
<br>
seemingly ordinary, seemingly boring, poorly written and excruciatingly
<br>
dramatic email is your new reading assignment.  Never in the history of our
<br>
species has a reading assignment reached such levels of anticipation on an
<br>
individual and international level.  There is the potential, and I write
<br>
these words without the slightest hint of sarcasm or jest that this reading
<br>
assignment will change your life, change the life of your friends and family
<br>
and even change the course of human history.  It is not unlikely that many
<br>
of you will think me, in addition to being ugly and ill-mannered, totally
<br>
and absolutely mad.  So it must be and I can offer no firm, incontrovertible
<br>
proof that I am not mad but I beg you, I implore you, I bow before you and
<br>
humbly ask that you read this book.  Read it, cherish it, absorb it, make
<br>
love with it.  You will consume it and in turn it will consume you.  So
<br>
without further ado........... (drum rolls)..................
<br>
<p><p>........                       ...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;................                         ................
<br>
<p>.                     . .
