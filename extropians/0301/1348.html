<p><em>&gt;I have yet to see any viable alternative course of action presented by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'anti war' groups. Id be willing to listen of course.
</em><br>
<p>Are they getting their voices in the media?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From what I saw during the two weeks I was in the U.S., the antiwar
<br>
groups were not given alot of 'airplay'.
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------
<br>
<p>Well consider a sample of what was said at the protest this previous weekend
<br>
(these are from Horowitz article -
<br>
<a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=5620">http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=5620</a>)
<br>
<p>&quot;We have to stop America's war against the people of Iraq, and the people of
<br>
Palestine, Colombia and the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The President wants to talk about a terrorist named bin Laden. I don't want
<br>
to talk about bin Laden. I want to talk about a terrorist called George
<br>
Washington. I want to talk about a terrorist called Rudy Guiliani. The real
<br>
terrorists have always been the United Snakes of America.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We 're calling for a System change,&quot; &quot;We won't get any justice as long as
<br>
that criminal Congress is up there. We're calling for revolution. It's
<br>
revolution time, brothers and sisters. We have to get rid of greedy
<br>
murderers and imperialists like George Bush in the White House.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;If you're looking for the Axis of Evil,&quot; &quot;then look inside the belly of
<br>
this beast.&quot;&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;&quot;Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld,&quot; he said, &quot;that's the Axis of Evil.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;In San Francisco, the most powerful Democrat legislator in the state John
<br>
Burton screamed, &quot;the President is full of shit&quot; and that the President was
<br>
&quot;fucking with us,&quot; while encouraging the general sentiment that America
<br>
rather than Iraq was the outlaw state.&quot;
<br>
<p>and DC ex-congresswoman Cynthia McKinney read a speech with the following
<br>
claim: &quot;In no other country on the planet do so many people have so little
<br>
as they do in this country.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Admittedly this is a small sample of what was said at these rallies, but do
<br>
we suspect that with sentiments like this flying around, that other
<br>
conversations included appeals to calm, rational and diplomatic solutions?
<br>
If these are the sentiments of anti-war protestors, its easy to see why they
<br>
might not get a lot of airplay, it would probably scare off the majority of
<br>
anti-war protestors who are more moderate and reasonable, who legitmately
<br>
feel that this is not a prudent course of action, but still acknowlege that
<br>
Sadam is a murderous tyrant.  Instead quick hit bullet lists would serve the
<br>
purpose better, just presenting them as 'peace activists' (even though the
<br>
organizers clearly support murderous regimes) and telling how many people
<br>
showed up would serve the purpose much more so then actually relaying what
<br>
they are saying, which would probably hurt the anti-war movement.
<br>
<p>Much of this similar sentiment is relayed by Tod Gitland, who is also
<br>
anti-war, in the NPR interview on Fresh Air which was run yesterday.
