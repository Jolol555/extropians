BBC - Grow trees to drive cars
<br>
==============================
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2689437.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2689437.stm</a>
<br>
<p>The best way to make the UK's road transport green could be a massive
<br>
tree-growing programme, researchers say. They say there is considerable
<br>
potential for producing hydrogen and alcohol fuels from fast-growing
<br>
trees like willows. A quarter of all the UK's agricultural land would be
<br>
enough to fuel the country's entire road transport sector, they believe.

Betterhumans - Reducing Fat Might Be How Caloric Restriction Works
<br>
==================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-23-9">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-23-9</a>
<br>
<p>By preventing overeating mice from accumulating fat, researchers have
<br>
provided a possible explanation for why restricting caloric intake
<br>
extends lifespan. According to a report by New Scientist, Ronald Kahn at
<br>
Harvard Medical School in Boston and colleagues extended the lifespan of
<br>
mice 18% simply by blocking their accumulation of fat in certain cells.

Nature - Nanotech is not so scary
<br>
=================================

<br>
<p>Given recent rumblings from opinion-formers, researchers working on the
<br>
science of the incredibly small should exert more effort on putting the
<br>
risks posed by their work into the proper perspective...

MSNBC - Clonaid official refuses questions
<br>
==========================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/858213.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/858213.asp</a>
<br>
<p>The vice president of Clonaid, which says it has now cloned three
<br>
babies, was ordered Wednesday to appear in court next week after
<br>
refusing to testify in detail about the headline-grabbing claim many
<br>
experts consider to be a hoax...

BBC - Computer boosts memory by 10%
<br>
===================================
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2683945.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2683945.stm</a>
<br>
<p>Scientists believe they may have found a way to improve our memory by as
<br>
much as 10%. Researchers at Imperial College London have used a
<br>
technique called neurofeedback to train people to remember more clearly.
<br>
It works by showing people their own brainwaves on a computer screen,
<br>
and teaching them how to control them.

BBC - Watching genes in action
<br>
==============================
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2680127.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2680127.stm</a>
<br>
<p>Scientists have found a way to study the shape and movement of
<br>
individual molecules of DNA, the genetic material that contains the
<br>
building blocks of life. The technique - called single molecule
<br>
fluorescence - has enabled researchers to obtain the most precise
<br>
information yet about the workings of single DNA molecules - which
<br>
measure just one millionth of a centimetre across.

Nature - DNA: Molecule of the year

<br>
<p>No contest, really. In recognition of the anniversary of publication of
<br>
the Watson and Crick paper on D.N.A. (sic) structure, this issue
<br>
includes facsimiles of the original and the two accompanying papers by
<br>
Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and co-workers, all part of a 60-page
<br>
supplement to mark the jubilee year. Full details on page 395. Elsewhere
<br>
in the issue it is DNA's dynamic properties, Jim Watson's personal
<br>
experiences and DNA's industrial consequences that entertain...

Science Blog - Monkeys Show Sophisticated Learning Abilities
<br>
============================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/community/article828.html">http://www.scienceblog.com/community/article828.html</a>
<br>
<p>Psychologists have found evidence that monkeys have sophisticated
<br>
abilities to acquire and apply knowledge using some of the same
<br>
strategies as do humans... The scientists said they have not yet found
<br>
the limits of the monkeys' learning capacity...

Betterhumans - Biosphere Project Losing Funding
<br>
===============================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-23-6">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-23-6</a>
<br>
<p>An ambitious project to simulate Earth's ecology and provide a model for
<br>
self-sustaining space facilities is losing funding. Biosphere 2, an
<br>
experimental structure containing rainforests, deserts, marshes and
<br>
oceans, was built by Texas billionaire Edward P. Bass.

New Scientist - Nuclear fusion could power NASA spacecraft
<br>
==========================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993294">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993294</a>
<br>
<p>The journey time from Earth orbit to Mars could be slashed from six
<br>
months to less than six weeks if NASA's idea for a nuclear
<br>
fusion-powered engine takes off... fusion drive would be able to
<br>
generate 300 times the thrust of any chemical rocket engine and use only
<br>
a fraction of its fuel mass. That means interplanetary missions would no
<br>
longer need to wait for a &quot;shortest journey&quot; launch window...
