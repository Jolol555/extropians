<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing to say is that human vision, from cornea through optic
<br>
nerve is extraordinarily complex.  Second, while I read about everything
<br>
published on vision during graduate school, over the last 3 decades my
<br>
reading in the area has been hit-and-miss.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young (1801) and Helmholtz (1852) postulated a tri-chromatic theory of
<br>
color vision, that humans have 3 types of rods.  Helmholtz drew theoretical
<br>
curves of sensitivity to the various wavelengths for each . . . the middle
<br>
one a &quot;bell curve&quot; maximally sensitive to green and the two others rather
<br>
skewed toward the central wavelengths and maximally sensitive to red/orange
<br>
and to blue/violet.  The theory was strongly supported at the retinal level
<br>
in 1964 when Marks, Dobelle &amp; MacNichol reported in _Science_ that the
<br>
absorption curves of single monkey and human cones fell into 3 groups.
<br>
[They extracted single cones and passed various wavelengths of light
<br>
through it &quot;the long way&quot; . . . important both because the photochemical
<br>
molecules are aligned for maximum reaction to light from that direction and
<br>
because of the limited sensitivity of the instrument that measured how much
<br>
came out the other end, i.e., was not absorbed.  To appreciate the
<br>
difficulty of dealing with a single cone, consider that each human eye
<br>
contains 6 to 7 million cones and 75 to 150 million rods.]  While their
<br>
data showed that the cones maximally sensitive to blue and to green were
<br>
more similar than Helmholtz had proposed a century earlier, most accepted
<br>
the idea of 3 types of cones, differing in their relative sensitivity to
<br>
the various wavelengths.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaddeus Cowan &lt;<a href="mailto:tc.pw@Relia.Net?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20(SK)%20Color%20Vision%20(was:%20The%20night%20side%20of%20science)">tc.pw@Relia.Net</a>&gt;  pointed to Cornsweet's statement
<br>
that there is a fourth sensitivity spectrum in the normal human eye, that
<br>
of the rods.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite correct, but generally considered irrelevant to color vision.
<br>
The clearest data demonstrating that the rods play no role in the
<br>
perception of color comes from comparing what humans see when a small
<br>
colored stimulus is focused on the dead center of the eye (fovea centralis,
<br>
which contains no rods) and when the same stimulus is focused sufficiently
<br>
off center so that it hits many rods (including about 20 degrees off
<br>
center, where the greatest rod concentration is found and rods are more
<br>
numerous than cones) . . . there is no difference in color naming / color
<br>
perception by many different measures, hence no impact of the rods.
<br>
Unfortunately for direct demonstration of this point, and vision research
<br>
generally, there is no place on the retina where only rods occur.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is possible that rods play some role in the perception of
<br>
large colored stimuli, which have been rarely studied, most vision
<br>
researchers consider that unlikely . . . even though the neural paths
<br>
leading from rods and cones are not completely separate even within the
<br>
retina much less in the optic nerve.  Incidentally, rods and cones are
<br>
distinguished either by differential histologic staining reactions or
<br>
absorption distributions . . . their name was assigned before we found that
<br>
the cones in the fovea are rod shaped.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 3 types of cones (the only receptors generally considered to be
<br>
involved in color vision) the typical human is trichromatic . . . and also
<br>
has rods.  The term tetrachromatic is reserved for those rare individuals
<br>
thought to have four types of cones (plus rods).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it has long been recognized that rods react differently to the
<br>
various wavelengths [for example, the amount of 510 nanometer or
<br>
&quot;blue-green&quot; light that can be detected by the rods under the most ideal
<br>
conditions is minuscule in contrast with the amount of light of around 680
<br>
nm or &quot;orange&quot; required before it is seen;  both appear gray].  But this
<br>
fact is primarily detected under special laboratory conditions whereas
<br>
every day we name colors . . . hence we focus on the color-naming measure.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One set of figures at hand shows 6% of males and 0.4% of females as
<br>
Deuteranopes (i.e., weak or nonfunctioning &quot;green&quot; cones).  Since we can't
<br>
yet directly measure the retina without destroying vision, the most precise
<br>
measures of color weakness come from asking people to match colors.
<br>
Deuteranopes with milder problems simply require more green than typical to
<br>
match yellow with a mixture of red and green.  In its stronger forms what
<br>
most of us see as bluish-red, green, and gray are said to be the same color
<br>
(i.e., perfect matches).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protanopes (2% of males and 0.04% of females, with &quot;red&quot; cone
<br>
problems) range from those requiring more red than typical to match yellow
<br>
with a combination of red and green to those who report red, bluish-green,
<br>
and gray to be the same color.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extremely rare Tritanope (0.0001% of males, too few females to
<br>
calculate) range from requiring more blue than typical to match blue-green
<br>
with a mixture of blue and green to a handful who report purplish blue,
<br>
greenish yellow, and gray as identical.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically the names trichromat, dichromat, and monochromat come
<br>
from a slightly different color matching task.  Consider the &quot;color
<br>
circle,&quot; formed by twisting the linear spectrum of wavelengths into a
<br>
circle so that hues directly opposite each other, when mixed in about equal
<br>
proportions, are seen as gray [i.e., green and red yield gray;  blue and
<br>
yellow yield gray . . . reference here to the &quot;additive mixing&quot; of shining
<br>
two separate lights on the same surface, not to the &quot;subtractive mixing&quot;
<br>
produced by two color filters in front of a single bulb or when mixing
<br>
paint].
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many different wavelengths, spaced reasonably apart on the circle,
<br>
are required for a human observer to match all possible single wavelengths
<br>
of light?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** an individual who has no cones will only require one . . . the
<br>
entire world appears gray, the only variation in vision is brightness;
<br>
hence the monochromat.  One can argue whether &quot;1&quot; color is seen or &quot;0&quot;, but
<br>
historically &quot;mono&quot; has been used.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** a few individuals are satisfied to match all possible hues when
<br>
only 2 wavelengths fairly far apart on the color circle are mixed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** most humans require only three lights to make a good match for all
<br>
possible wavelengths.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** I have been told (but never seen in a refereed journal or standard
<br>
text) of a few individuals, all women, who are not satisfied with the
<br>
matches unless four colors from the circle are used;  presumably these are
<br>
the tetrachromats referred to by Emlyn [sorry, I've lost the fuller
<br>
attribution].  While color weakness affects roughly 16 times more men than
<br>
women, some of the most interesting variations are found in females.
<br>
Another one, also with only a handful of cases, consist of humans with
<br>
normal color vision in one eye and marked color weakness in the other eye.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One set of figures shows 92.0% of males and 99.6% of females to be
<br>
trichromats.  Anomalous trichromats, those presumed to have &quot;weakness&quot; in
<br>
one of their cone types, constitute 5.9% of males and 0.4% of females.
<br>
Dichromats, those with only 2 functioning cone types, make up 2.1% of males
<br>
and only 0.03% of females.  Rod monochromats, those with cones either
<br>
absent or not functioning . . . and the only ones mentioned here that are
<br>
truly &quot;color blind&quot;, are 0.003% of males and 0.002% of females.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If everything seems clear so far, watch out.  The major rival to the
<br>
Young-Helmholtz tri-chromatic theory of color vision was Hering's 1874
<br>
opponent-process theory.  Following in the tradition of astute observations
<br>
by Leonardo da Vinci and Goethe, he postulated four basic colors (in
<br>
mutually antagonistic pairs) and three receptors:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* a red--green receptor, red from breakdown or dissimilation and green
<br>
from assimilation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* a yellow--blue receptor,  the yellow being dissimilation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* a white--black receptor,  the white being dissimilation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the single cone sensitivity data of Marks et al in the mid-1960s
<br>
there was no clear winner between the two theories, as some color vision
<br>
effects supported one theory, other effects its rival.  For a short period
<br>
after Marks et al it appeared that Hering was wrong.  But then the vision
<br>
theorists started asking why several phenomena so strongly supported the
<br>
Hering notion.  For example, the negative after-image:-  stare at a vivid
<br>
red patch for a minute then immediately look at a white or light gray . . .
<br>
the gray appears greenish (and vice versa);  clearly an opponent-process
<br>
sort of event.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some additional work the currently accepted understanding
<br>
arose:-  the Young-Helmholtz tri-chromatic theory describes how the retina
<br>
works (i.e., there really are 3 types of cones in the typical human eye)
<br>
but the neural pulses are converted into something very much like Hering's
<br>
opponent-process for the passage through the optic nerve to the brain.
<br>
Hence color vision is a combination of a tri-chromatic physiology (retinal)
<br>
and a two-part opponent-process physiology (neural).  Depending on the
<br>
task, one of these may play the major role and the other be almost
<br>
undetectable . . . hence the age-old inability to decide between the two
<br>
theories.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we have, at about the same time as Marks et al, the Nobel
<br>
prize-winning work of Hubel and Wiesel, who showed that some visual
<br>
receptors more readily detect vertical bars of light whereas others are
<br>
more sensitive to horizontal or 90-degree angle bars.  How does this tie in
<br>
to color vision and the Young-Helmholtz / Hering notions?  And we haven't
<br>
even mentioned moving stimuli . . . .

<p>[...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      With 3 types of cones (the only receptors generally considered to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in color vision) the typical human is trichromatic . . . and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has rods.  The term tetrachromatic is reserved for those rare individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought to have four types of cones (plus rods).
</em><br>
<p>The only reference I could find for &quot;tetrachromatic&quot; was in Cornsweet's
<br>
book.  Even though I've taught this stuff for 30+ years, it would not
<br>
surprise me to find a few lacunae in my knowledge.  Here is your
<br>
opportunity to teach an old dog a new trick.  I would like to know the
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>1) What retinal area is sensitive to the &quot;second&quot; interpretation of
<br>
green?  The retinal areas sensitive to red and green are small and
<br>
overlap (pretty much).  The areas sensitive to blue and yellow are
<br>
larger an overlap (pretty much).  Does the retinal area for the new
<br>
color enjoyed by the tetrachromat overlap the red-green area or fall
<br>
somewhere between the blue-yellow area?
<br>
<p>2) What does the spectral absorption curve for the fourth cone look
<br>
like?
<br>
<p>3) What is the new color's complement?
<br>
<p>These are very basic questions. Surely these data are available
<br>
somewhere.
<br>
<p>Finally, how does the existence of a fourth cone change our
<br>
understanding of the opposing process mechanisms in the LGN?  Normally,
<br>
for the trichromat there are three centers--a blue-yellow, red-green,
<br>
and black-white (light present-light absent).  Is there a fourth center
<br>
for &quot;new green&quot; and its complement?
