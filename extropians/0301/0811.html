In a message dated 1/17/2003 9:46:55 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:thespike@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20rooting%20for%20the%20Americans">thespike@earthlink.net</a> writes: This was the gravamen of the angry spat 
<br>
between Robert Heinlein and Arthur Clarke over SDI plans; Heinlein felt 
<br>
insulted to be given contrary advice on his own soil about the actions of his 
<br>
own nation; Clarke quite correctly spoke out in defence of us all, Americans 
<br>
and otherwise.
<br>
<p>Damien,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have heard that story there were two offenses given.  On the 
<br>
issue involved Heinlein did not think Clark and Sri Lanka had even a 
<br>
secondary interest.  If America chose to defend itself in that manner it 
<br>
neither increased nor decreased the likelihood of Sri Lanka getting a missile 
<br>
thrown its way.  That seems to have been Heinlein's position.  Had Clarke or 
<br>
Sri Lanka had an interest they would have been welcome to their insistence -- 
<br>
more than a mere opinion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, under examination it quickly became apparent that Clarke 
<br>
with his powerful mind had not even superficially examined the issues 
<br>
involved he had simply repeated some opinions he had heard some of his 
<br>
friends express.  In short Clarke was talking out of turn and through his 
<br>
ear.  There is nothing correct in speaking out of turn on a matter that 
<br>
Clarke had not had the courtesy to consider before speaking.  He made a poor 
<br>
show all around I would say and point to Clarke's apology to Heinlein later.  
<br>
To his credit Clarke came to understand his offense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have opened this can of worms the question that keeps running 
<br>
through my mind is this: Why is it in Australia's interest to have the US 
<br>
continue playing the sacrificial lamb instead of taking arms against a 4th 
<br>
rate dictator and his ilk.  Did the bomb on Bali scare your nation so badly?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In asking that question I have to separate my question to you and any 
<br>
possible question about the valor of the Australian fighting man -- that is 
<br>
above reproach.
<br>
Ron h.
