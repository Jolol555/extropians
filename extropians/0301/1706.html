Chromosome Study Links Telomere Length to Survival
<br>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Could extending telomeres, those bits of DNA at the ends
<br>
of chromosomes in cells, prolong lives?
<br>
<p>Some scientists think so.
<br>
<p>Researchers in the United States, who discovered that elderly people with
<br>
longer telomeres lived five to six years longer than people with shorter
<br>
ones, think increasing the length of telomeres could be a possible key to a
<br>
longer life.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the first research study showing that telomere length is predictive
<br>
of survival in humans,&quot; said Dr Richard Cawthon, of the University of Utah,
<br>
who headed the research team.
<br>
<p>Telomeres are similar to the plastic caps on the end of shoe laces that
<br>
prevent fraying. The bits of DNA wear down and get shorter as cells divide,
<br>
which scientists believe is a natural process of aging.
<br>
<p>Cells from people with a variety of diseases have been found to have
<br>
shortened telomeres.
<br>
<p>Cawthon and his colleagues measured and ranked the telomere length in blood
<br>
samples of 143 people over the age of 60 and compared their cause and age of
<br>
death.
<br>
<p>In a research letter published in The Lancet medical journal, they reported
<br>
that people with the longest telomeres lived up to five years longer than
<br>
those with shorter telomeres, who had higher rates of death from heart
<br>
disease and infectious illnesses.
<br>
Cawthon believes the results of his research support the hypothesis that
<br>
telomere shortening is a natural aging process which may contribute to
<br>
deaths from a variety of age-related diseases.
<br>
<p>&quot;If this is correct, then it may be possible to extend the duration of
<br>
healthy adult life using medical interventions that maintain telomere
<br>
length,&quot; he added in a statement.
<br>
<p>Research into telomeres is still in its early phases but scientists believe
<br>
that increased understanding about telomeres and telomerase, an enzyme that
<br>
strengthens and lengthens them, will improve understanding of age-related
<br>
diseases and the aging process itself.
