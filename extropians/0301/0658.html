<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin asks:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What is a natural right?  Who issued it?  From whence does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it come, or emanate? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think of natural law as an emergent property of biological evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All creatures have a natural right to struggle to better their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence, because that is what it *means* to be a living creature. 
</em><br>
<p>This is a little circular, of course  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This does not however mean that all living creatures should expect their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural rights never to be violated. The world is inherently unjust.
</em><br>
<p>Stuart Kauffman has a very exciting &quot;Prolegomenon&quot; (i.e. preface)
<br>
to his book &quot;Investigations&quot;.  He starts with an intriguing definition
<br>
&quot;an autonomous agent is a physical system, such as a bacterium, that
<br>
can act on its own behalf in an environment.&quot;
<br>
<p>He is totally aware, by the way, of the salience of the concept
<br>
&quot;its own behalf&quot; that he has invoked here, and how crucial it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are lost and hungry in the desert then you have a natural right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill and eat rattlesnakes.  But don't be fooled into thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rattlesnakes don't also have a natural right to defend themselves. 
</em><br>
<p>Then why doesn't everything we do---since we are biological
<br>
organisms---fall under this rubric?  E.g., Adolph Hitler had
<br>
a natural right to feed upon all his countless victims.  We
<br>
are, after all, speaking scientifically here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; For example, it's not been found in our DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, it is the very essence of our DNA.
</em><br>
<p>Would you therefore expect that the next robot I design,
<br>
which flees from lights and moving objects and feeds upon
<br>
unguarded electricity outlets to have its own &quot;natural
<br>
right&quot; to that electricity?  (Just as I have a natural
<br>
right to hunt my critter down and turn it back into spare
<br>
parts?)
<br>
<p>So then we can find in my computer code that natural right
<br>
just as we find in DNA our natural right?  Preposterous.
<br>
<p>Lee
