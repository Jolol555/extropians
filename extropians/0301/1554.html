<p>Interesting stuff!  But when you put it in a side view so that all that is
<br>
visible are only three rectangles, shouldn't you also be able to stretch
<br>
that
<br>
shape and thereby lengthen the rectangles? Is the limit in the programming
<br>
or the user-perceiver-interface (me)?
<br>
<p>I read a book featuring tesseracts recently. Unfortunately the friend that
<br>
gave me the book for Xmas has commandeered it to check it out herself so
<br>
I haven't got it handy to check the author or title. In the book the
<br>
tesseract
<br>
was draw as a three dimensional cross. 3 cubes wide, four long, one deep.
<br>
To see it as a tesseract you had to imagine the two farthest sides of the
<br>
3 cube crossbar being bent around to touch each other, and the same thing
<br>
hapening at the same time with the four cube long 'main beam'. This seemed
<br>
to raise a problem, though. The visual &quot;bending&quot; could be done in either of
<br>
two ways. The three cube and four cube lengths could be bent in the same
<br>
direction (the four around the three) or they could be bent in opposite
<br>
directions (three &quot;in&quot; and four &quot;out&quot;).
<br>
<p>I find this whole 4 D space thing really interesting. I can never quite tell
<br>
if
<br>
I'm being invited to imaging something absurb (like hearing someone say
<br>
&quot;picture a square with three equal sides&quot; - which I &quot;picture&quot; as a triangle
<br>
by
<br>
&quot;any other name&quot;), or whether its just that my perceptions can't do
<br>
correctly
<br>
what they are being challenged, quite validly, to do.
<br>
<p>H G Well's Timemachine made time the fourth dimension. Seeing length,
<br>
width, breadth and then duration as all essential to the &quot;existence&quot; of
<br>
everyday
<br>
objects wasn't too hard.
<br>
<p>But the tesseract is, (as I understand it), using four *space* dimensions
<br>
each at 90 degrees to the others. So space would be the fifth.
<br>
<p>Then I try and imagine something like Hawkings objects with 10 or 11
<br>
dimensions and the wheels are way off. Best I can do is imagine three
<br>
axis with six or seven very small balloons attached to the origin. These
<br>
balloon dimensions would always be there but only kick in and have an
<br>
impact when the length of the rays from the x, y and z axis are shortened
<br>
way way down.
<br>
<p>I enjoyed hearing Carl Sagan describe &quot;Flatland&quot; on his TV series Cosmos
<br>
when I was in secondary school in the early 1980's. But I never really *got*
<br>
the point either visually or conceptually. I think &quot;the point&quot; was to
<br>
extrapolation Flatland (the example) but to see ourselves as 3-space-D
<br>
beings incapable of seeing 4-space-D objects but able to see their
<br>
3-space-D &quot;image&quot; or &quot;shaddow&quot; as it passed through our
<br>
3-space-D universe. I think the shaddow of the 4-space-D cube was the
<br>
tesseract but I'm not sure. I was watching in on TV (only 2D) and couldn't
<br>
manipulate (as with the link above) and so I think my mind just gave up on
<br>
it.
