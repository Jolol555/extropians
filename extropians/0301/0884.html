<p><em>&gt; &quot;Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers. 
</em><br>
<p>It does indeed. The US could lose the war, for instance. Saddam's
<br>
strategy in the last wars was stupid, to say something polite. Both
<br>
against Iran and the US he was copying the Verdun 1916 situation. It
<br>
wasn't successful against Iran and against the US, it was a pure
<br>
desaster because the US forces did not need to fight this way. Instead
<br>
they used their superior air force to smash them. Now what happens if:
<br>
<p>1. Saddam distributes his army in the cities, basically hiding behind
<br>
children and women. The US forces would need to fight for each and
<br>
every house. Is the US prepared for another gorilla war after Vietnam?
<br>
<p>2. The US forces get too lax and make a mistake. Iraqi ground forces
<br>
launch a fast attack on Saudi/Kuwait territory, forcing the surprised
<br>
US forces into a large scale ground battle?
<br>
<p>After a first success there might be other Arabian leaders joining the
<br>
war on Saddam's side and suddenly we have the war here in Europe. I'd
<br>
hate to see Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW produce robots-of-war instead
<br>
of luxury cars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is because we believe that, if Saddam does not yield,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action may eventually be the least awful necessity for Iraq, for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Middle East and for the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>.... since awful oil prices like we have now are not good for the
<br>
economy. Bombing Iraq into the ground will lead to plenty of orders
<br>
after the war. Siemens can sell a pro West Iraq all the nuclear power
<br>
plants they don't need and Lockheed can rebuild the Iraqi air force.
<br>
All payed with cheap oil. Wonderful.
<br>
<p>Who in his right state of mind believes that humanitarian issues are in
<br>
the Bush family's equation?
