<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps we can upgrade even the uncritical to say, &quot;this is my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working hypothesis!&quot;  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It is a nice thought :-) 
<br>
<p>And I *like* the alternative wording. A pity that it's so verbose.
<br>
<p>The extra work and thought load is perhaps analogous to the
<br>
effort that is require to use gender neutral language. Its a pain to
<br>
have to say &quot;she or he&quot; using three words when previously one 
<br>
would have done but a lot of folk seem to have accepted the
<br>
argument that the effort is worth it to move toward less gender
<br>
biased language. 
<br>
<p>And seriously, I wouldn't want to coerce them. I hope they'll
<br>
come around of their own accord, persuaded by the over-
<br>
whelming logic, good sense and humanity of those extropians,
<br>
transhumanists and free thinkers whom they meet and who 
<br>
counsel against the dangers of false certainty and point out
<br>
the anti-social nature of dogmatic belief.
<br>
<p>After all, even those into &quot;belief&quot; in a big way, don't think
<br>
those who hold mutually exclusive &quot;beliefs&quot; to theirs, have an
<br>
equal claim to veracity.
