<p>
I don't know why I didn't think of this before but it occurs
<br>
that PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) should be able to
<br>
be  used to determine whether the same genome exists in
<br>
say placental tissue (which would only be around with an
<br>
infant) and public hair (which a neonate would not yet have
<br>
developed). Both these tissue types ought to be recognizable 
<br>
and what they are and collecting them would harm neither
<br>
mother nor child and could be done by Clonaid itself.
<br>
<p>Unless I'm mistaken sending the placenta from an alleged
<br>
clone along with some pubic hair from the mother would
<br>
enable a pretty good verification of a cloning event without
<br>
necessitating the clones parents reveal their identity.
<br>
<p>I'm not certain about the difference between pubic hair and
<br>
say the hair on an infants head, but I suspect there would
<br>
be a difference.
<br>
<p>Perhaps next time anyone claims a cloned child this request
<br>
for tissue could be made in a put up or shut up manner.
<br>
<p>Any thoughts?
<br>
