<em>&gt;  &gt; When did people start thinking war was an acceptable tool of policy
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Y'know, I think he has a point there.  It may sound dreadfully banal, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's still a hell of a strong argument:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War is bad.
</em><br>
<p>I think, yes, war is bad and it never becomes a good. But we don't
<br>
alway get to choose the good. Sometimes we only get to choose
<br>
the least bad. The human predicament is such that others can remove
<br>
from us the option of choosing the good and make us choose between
<br>
lesser bads.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, war is less bad than the alternatives. Sometimes.
<br>
<p>It is because war is so *obviously* bad, that I think, the burden of
<br>
making a case in each particular instance for going to war, for taking
<br>
a nation a war, should lie with those arguing for it, rather than those
<br>
arguing against it.
<br>
<p>I'm my opinion, in history, there have unfortunately, been many wars
<br>
where, leaders exercising their judgement, as best they could, and acting
<br>
in response to dire circumstances, as they perceived them, have concluded
<br>
that war, though undesirable was the least worst practical choice.
<br>
<p>In many cases, unfortunately, I think, I would in the shoes of those leaders
<br>
have had to agree with them.
