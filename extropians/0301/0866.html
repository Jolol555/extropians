<p>I.e, you want liberal democracy rather than majority democracy. There is 
<br>
plenty of political philosophy on this issue; very few people think that 
<br>
majority democracy is anything good (other than being better than the 
<br>
truly awful systems). When democracy becomes really constructive is when 
<br>
it is built on a constitution and political culture that respects the 
<br>
rights of people (rights to life, freedom, expression, property etc), 
<br>
especially the rights of the minority. 
<br>
<p>The problem with building liberal democracies is that it is not just 
<br>
about writing a nice constitution (although that helps; I envy you 
<br>
americans your constitutionalism!) but to get institutions to actually 
<br>
respect the rights set down therein. It is about the same problem as 
<br>
Hernando de Soto described about bootstrapping a market economy: if the 
<br>
culture and institutions are not right, it won't work outside small 
<br>
sectors. You need to set up the culture and institutions that act as 
<br>
checks and balances, and this can't be done onvernight and must be done 
<br>
while building the rest of the constitutional system. Messy. 
<br>
<p>The worst thing about this IMHO is that it is almost a conservative
<br>
position: good democracies are enormously path dependent and one should 
<br>
be careful about not destroying key components. But fortunately a strong 
<br>
civil society seems to be a good buffer to handle even seriously 
<br>
out-of-line institutions.
