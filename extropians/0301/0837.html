Following up on John's post (which I hope he will repost to Cryonet)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:Azt28@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Non-local%20force%20fields%20vrs.%20nanotech?">Azt28@aol.com</a>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Plain false, you can't extract/destroy/neutralize 10^25 or so toxic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-freeze molecules with nano-devices in the sub-micrometer range.
</em><br>
<p>The task of molecular sorting is discussed extensively in Nanomedicine
<br>
Sections 3.4.2 - 3.5.9.
<br>
<p>Just a quick glance at the paper on Respirocytes:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html">http://www.foresight.org/Nanomedicine/Respirocytes.html</a>
<br>
<p>indicates that ~10^15 respirocytes (section 4.2) are capable of storing
<br>
~10^24 molecules of O2 in 6 minutes.  The primary limit being the constraint
<br>
on heat removal in a &quot;natural&quot; human body.  This can certainly be improved
<br>
upon during cryonic reanimation where one could have the body suspended in
<br>
a circulating coolant that controls temperature and removes heat.  So IMO,
<br>
Yvan's claim is unsubstantiated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Simple maths, not tensor calculus are against you. Freezing produces disorders at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sub millimeter level, a nanodevice can do nothing for it. That has been well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained by Thomas Donaldson not so long ago. More I look at it, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotech looks as religion in tech disguise. Sorry I don't buy it.
</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  More claims that are unsubstantiated.  See:
<br>
<p>R. Merkle, &quot;The molecular repair of the brain&quot;, Cryonics, 15(1&amp;2) (Jan &amp; Apr 1994).
<br>
<a href="http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html">http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html</a>
<br>
and the mechanical manipulation capabilities of nanorobots:
<br>
R. Freitas, Nanomedicine [Section 9.3: Nanomanipulators], Landes Bioscience (1999).
<br>
and the recent discussion between Ray Kurzweil, Eric Drexler and myself:
<br>
<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html?id%3D1587">http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news_single.html?id%3D1587</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; See above: you are in mere faith domain, not science or technology. Outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some gadgets I see nothing really new in the past 30 years... oh, pardon me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I forgot our current incapacity to go to the Moon. I see a big regression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ,not &quot;god-like&quot; progress.
</em><br>
<p>Thirty years ago, one could not sequence a bacterial genome (period).
<br>
Now the major genome sequencing centers can accomplish this in a couple
<br>
of days.  If we really wanted to go to the moon again, I sure we could
<br>
do it within a decade, more probably within 5 years -- its a cost problem
<br>
not a technology problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you doubt this, just think of all the things that were &quot;impossible&quot; thirty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or forty years ago that are now commonplace.  The curve is only getting steeper, too!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :-) blind faith.
</em><br>
<p>No, the evidence seems to be there in *some* areas, such as microelectronics.
<br>
Moore's Law *does* seem to be speeding up.  Go read Kurzweil's books.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Non local force fields and discontinuous one may be the big next step in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics and so in instrumentation. That is the key to reanimation technology.
</em><br>
<p>While you may believe that -- it involves a great deal of hand waving
<br>
and &quot;magic&quot; physics (for example I'd put &quot;quantum computing&quot; in the
<br>
realm of magic physics -- we have hints that it might be possible but
<br>
nobody has managed to translate the fantasy into a reality except on
<br>
a very very limited scale).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have given the example of quotien fields everywhere accelerated as a source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of light inside the body able to destroy toxic molecules and power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitochondria before the general blood circulation start again.
</em><br>
<p>Molecular sorting rotors are much more real than &quot;quotien fields&quot; (whatever they
<br>
are).  They operate on physical principles essentially the same as the dozens
<br>
of types of ion pumps that we have the genetic sequences, and in a few cases
<br>
the crystal structures of (so we largely understand how they work at a physical
<br>
level).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application and without the tensor background it is Harry Potter science. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may don't want to read the theory behind a technology, but if you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand what is going on, you must have a reference background in cryonet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; archives.
</em><br>
<p>Yvan, I'd urge you to read some of the background material I've cited.  Its fine
<br>
to want to contribute new ideas but it isn't very useful to 'dis ideas that
<br>
some *very* bright people have thought about for between 10 and 20 years.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Robert Bradbury
