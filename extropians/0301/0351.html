<p>Why Smart People Can Be So Stupid
<br>
by Robert J. Sternberg (Editor)
<br>
Yale University Press, 2002
<br>
<p>Review by Keith S. Harris, Ph.D. on Jan 1st 2003
<br>
<p>We all know of people like that. They are educated, intelligent, sophisticated,
<br>
verbal and very often successful.  They run companies, run for office, teach in
<br>
major universities, and receive coveted awards for competence in their chosen
<br>
fields: People that, once in a while, without reasonable explanation, do stupid
<br>
things - - sometimes very stupid things.
<br>
<p>This collection of eleven loosely connected chapters provides a good foundation
<br>
from which to launch an inquiry into why smart people commit serious goofs, and
<br>
yet leaves plenty of room for the reader to continue with her or his own
<br>
speculations.
<br>
<p>The authors, distinguished academics, are all well respected in their areas of
<br>
specialization.  The list of contributors includes Prof. Robert Sternberg, the
<br>
current President of the American Psychological Association (for 2003) and a
<br>
frequently published researcher in the area of intelligence, and Prof. Walter
<br>
Mischel, with whose work every psychology student is familiar.

<br>
<p>One need not look far to find breathtaking acts of stupidity committed by
<br>
people who are smart, or even brilliant. The behavior of smart
<br>
individuals--from presidents to prosecutors to professors--is at times so
<br>
amazingly stupid as to seem inexplicable. Why do otherwise intelligent people
<br>
think and behave in ways so stupid that they sometimes destroy their
<br>
livelihoods or even their lives?
<br>
<p>This book is the first devoted to investigating what the most current
<br>
psychological research can tell us about stupidity in everyday life. The
<br>
contributors to the volume, renowned scholars in various areas of human
<br>
intelligence, present fascinating examples of people messing up their lives,
<br>
and they offer insights into the reasons for such behavior. From a variety of
<br>
perspectives, the contributors discuss
<br>
<p>The nature and theory of stupidity
<br>
<p>How stupidity contributes to stupid behavior
<br>
<p>Whether stupidity is measurable
<br>
<p>While many millions of dollars are spent each year on intelligence research and
<br>
testing to determine who has the ability to succeed, next to nothing is spent
<br>
to determine who will make use of their intelligence and not squander it by
<br>
behaving stupidly. Why Smart People Can Be So Stupid focuses on the neglected
<br>
side of this discussion, reviewing the full range of theory and research on
<br>
stupid behavior and analyzing what it tells us about how people can avoid
<br>
stupidity and its devastating consequences.
<br>
<p>Robert J. Sternberg is IBM Professor of Psychology and Education, and director
<br>
of PACE, the Center for the Psychology of Abilities, Competencies, and
<br>
Expertise at Yale University. He is the author or editor of some sixty books
<br>
and a widely known expert on intelligence testing.
<br>
<p><p>Why do intelligent people sometimes behave in ways so stupid that they destroy
<br>
their livelihoods or even their lives? This book is the first to investigate
<br>
the psychological basis for stupidity in everyday life. Experts shed light on
<br>
the nature and theory of stupidity, whether stupidity is measurable, how people
<br>
can avoid stupidity and its devastating consequences, and much more.
<br>
<p>This original book gathers together the best thinking and research on what
<br>
causes smart people to do foolish things. A highly original work with an
<br>
exceptional list of contributors.î--Martin Ford, Graduate School of Education,
<br>
George Mason University
<br>
<p>Why Smart People Can Be So Stupid offers serious answers to a neglected
<br>
conundrum, one with ramifications for understanding the very nature of
<br>
intelligence itself. As always, Robert Sternberg takes on important issues in a
<br>
creative way, and has gathered a strong band of contributors, each of whom
<br>
offers an insightful analysis. A rewarding read.î--Daniel Goleman, Ph.D.,
<br>
author of Emotional Intelligence
<br>
<p>One way to generate interesting, new research ideas in science is to take an
<br>
old idea and turn it on its head (as Yale social psychologist, William McGuire
<br>
once said, ëthe opposite of a great truth is also a great truthí). In this
<br>
volume, Bob Sternberg and the experts he has assembled attempt to understand
<br>
the psychological basis of narrow models of intelligence. Foolishness runs
<br>
rampant--from the schoolroom to the boardroom to the bedroom--in part because
<br>
we are afforded insufficient practice to hone our practical, emotional, and
<br>
social competencies, what Jack Mayer and I like to call our ëhot
<br>
intelligences.í By revealing the many ways in which smart people behave
<br>
maladaptively and the social conditions that give rise to such bungling, the
<br>
contributors to this volume stimulate new directions for theory, research, and
<br>
practice with respect to human intelligence.î--Peter Salovey, Chris Argyris
<br>
Professor and Chair of Psychology, Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health,
<br>
Yale University
<br>
<p>This bookís intent is something that academia needs. Intelligence may be
<br>
something of a cult, but stupidity only receives cursory treatment. . . .
<br>
Precisely because the state of being dumb has no analogue to being smart, Why
<br>
Smart People Can Be So Stupid provides valuable insight into a subject that
<br>
eludes, but intrigues as well.î--James A. Crawford, The Harvard Crimson
