<p>
The &quot;extropians?&quot; thread got me thinking about extropian lifestyles and how
<br>
knowledge of 'extropian' topics affects our daily living. Myself, I've
<br>
become more cautious. I find it quite believeable that I could live
<br>
indefinitely, so if I died tomorrow I'd lose a lot more life than your
<br>
average joe thinks he'd lose.
<br>
<p>So when I'm walking along a road, I find myself wondering  if walking on the
<br>
outside of the footpath makes me *that little* bit safer than walking on the
<br>
roadside. Does holding the handrail when going down the stairs improve my
<br>
survival chances, even just a bit? Do these improvements all add up? Silly I
<br>
know, but surely  the answer is yes?
<br>
<p>It's not that simple though: walking to work gives me some good exercise,
<br>
improving my health and thus supposedly extending my life, but I have to
<br>
walk alongside roads. Might a car hit me? Might the carbon monoxide from the
<br>
traffic cancel out the health benefits of walking?
<br>
<p>I have no intention of becoming a paranoid shutin so I obviously draw the
<br>
line somewhere. I don't smoke or drink, but I do go scuba diving, which is
<br>
far more dangerous than walking to work! The reason I think about the
<br>
'hazards' of walking on one side of the path rather than the other is the
<br>
fact that I can make little adjustments like this to my life with zero
<br>
impact. Walking on the 'safe' side doesn't disadvantage me in any way.
<br>
<p>What about the things that only disadvantage me a bit? I'm no great fan of
<br>
fish, so it wouldn't pain me so much to give it up in exchange for the
<br>
safety of not choking on a bone. I do spend too much time working, at the
<br>
expense of my health (RSI and posture), but am I willing to switch jobs for
<br>
a little health/safety improvement?
<br>
<p>And what about the things that majorly increase lifespan at the expense of
<br>
lifestyle? I just couldn't do calorie restriction.
<br>
<p>Where do others draw the line? Did you buy an LCD monitor to protect you
<br>
from the CRT radiation, convincing yourself that you actually bought it
<br>
because it looked better? Do you eat fish with bones in it? Do you sniff for
<br>
gas before switching on the lights?
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
JA
