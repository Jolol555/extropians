<em>&gt; As an aside, the vast and overwhelming majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communists/Socialists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here are Catholics.  
</em><br>
<p>Well of course the Bible describes Jesus as a
<br>
socialist in many ways...of course there weren't
<br>
factories then, industrialism being key to the
<br>
movement.  I believe there was a paper out a few years
<br>
ago entitled &quot;Jesus: the family-hating communist&quot; the
<br>
phrase seems to have become a buzz on shows like
<br>
politically incorect as of late.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you'd be incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard pushed to find a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-believer among them.
</em><br>
<p>maybe in Ireland, but it's definetely mixed in
<br>
America.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Atheism is non-belief.  It's difficult to motivate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to murder, rape 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and torture for &quot;nothing&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>well the original assertion given on the list was that
<br>
atheists exhibit the same fervor as those of the
<br>
religions of Abraham.  (in different words I don't
<br>
recall exactly).  I seek, still, evidence that this is
<br>
true, since although there are plenty embittered
<br>
atheists, I know of no evidence that they behave in
<br>
the same manner as those of faith except when a cause
<br>
known for atrocities was inseparable.  After
<br>
questioning the assertion and pondering, I feel
<br>
comfortable making the challenge that no, atheists
<br>
cannot be considered as equivalent, and the religion
<br>
apologists who do this cause a grave disservice, IMO. 
<br>
<p>Secularism is still popular (although people forget
<br>
all the little censorship issues and moralistic laws
<br>
which faith still governs...a little here, a little
<br>
there...) but more and more people speak out for faith
<br>
in the schools, and government in America.  Whereas
<br>
atheists haven't to my knowledge even suggested
<br>
anything to infringe on the rights of the religious
<br>
save for their 'right' to control others.  I
<br>
appreciated the link to Dawkins' article
<br>
<a href="http://www.ffrf.org/dawkins.html">http://www.ffrf.org/dawkins.html</a> provided by Olga, as
<br>
he did a good job of explaining why monotheism is the
<br>
source of many of the modern world's problems. 
<br>
Atheism doesn't at all fit into the equation, and when
<br>
&nbsp;comments like &quot;well don't forget atheism too&quot; are
<br>
stated, it distorts the issue.
