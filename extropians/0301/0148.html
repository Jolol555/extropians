<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    I warm to the humanity in the guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is that the bit where he says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt; Mr. Gubrud also states that I am a White Power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  racist... and that I am an admirer of Nazi Germany as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a model of transhumanism. This is true, up to a  point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Sometimes I describe myself as a &quot;Post-Nazi.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No. 
<br>
<p>Indeed if I were conversing with him rather than just reading 
<br>
what he wrote, I'd have pulled him up at the point where he 
<br>
said he was an admirer of Nazi Germany and said something 
<br>
like &quot;what an unusual statement, in what respect do you admire
<br>
Nazi Germany as a model of transhumanism (or as a model of
<br>
anything else which I consider good for that matter)?&quot; Then, 
<br>
depending on what he said, I might he interested in asking &quot;at
<br>
what point do your diverge with what you see as the Nazi
<br>
Germany model of transhumanism?&quot; And as an aside, &quot;Why 
<br>
would you choose to deliberate associate yourself with a 
<br>
regime that surely you must know most people cannot even
<br>
consider without the emotional blinders going up&quot;? How 
<br>
do you figure that it is worth it to take on such baggage?&quot; 
<br>
<p>Of course I'm being just a tad disingenuous here because
<br>
having read the link you provided I think I can make 
<br>
reasonable guesses at some of his answers, but possibly 
<br>
not everyone reading this post will have read the link. It's
<br>
longish.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or this bit:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt; In those days I was a big fan of Martin Luther King Jr.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which was somewhat scandalous in Midland at that time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Having a black tentmate  was a reality check. It was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  first step on a path that would lead me, years later, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  become a racist -- but that's another story... The conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is that I shouldn't be making such a big deal about this. I dissent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from consensus reality in many ways. Always have, always will. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that I dissent on the issue of race is not particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  important.  &gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p>Although this does have the ring of a true account as the teller 
<br>
perceives it, to me. I agree with the bit about he shouldn't be
<br>
making a big deal about it, but its a bit late having gone that far
<br>
he shouldn't have stopped there. Would have been better not
<br>
to have started then to have stopped there.   
<br>
<p>*Why* he chose to call himself a &quot;racist&quot;, to raise the &quot;red flag&quot; so 
<br>
to speak, knowing it was a &quot;red flag&quot; is a bit perplexing, but on the
<br>
information I have of the guy I don't think he's particularly 
<br>
politically savvy. Again, I would have pulled him up in person, (just
<br>
as some folk are pulling me up ;-) and asked him for clarification.
<br>
<p>Neither of the above statements, especially in isolation, were what
<br>
made me say I warmed to the humanity in the guy. But he did say
<br>
quite a lot of other things. And the above are only extracts.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's heart warming, I know, this fearless quest for truth.
</em><br>
<p>I've grinned at this line for nearly a minute now. Beware of sharp 
<br>
writers baring word traps ;-) They are nearly as &quot;bad&quot; as reporters.       
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    are asking me whether right now he and I are in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    agreement in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    world views - I don't know but I seriously doubt it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't know?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what *his* views are today, he seemed to
<br>
me to be the type likely to change his mind, to speak over
<br>
loosely and with some political naivety about what's on his
<br>
mind.
<br>
<p>I think its a certainty that in some of the *details*, *my* world
<br>
view will be different next year to what it is this year. Sometimes
<br>
*details* matter. I think some of the details I've acquired in say 
<br>
the last year may make me a more effective political animal
<br>
for the propagation of the memes I have had longer. 
<br>
<p>I did like *that* about the guy, he was willing to change his
<br>
mind and correct his errors. He was also willing to consider 
<br>
things *for himself* that most folks, even bright folks, usually
<br>
take for granted. I think people *should* go through a process
<br>
of asking themselves why it is wrong to be sexist or racist or 
<br>
species-ist at some stage in their lives, otherwise I can't really
<br>
see how they can honestly conclude they've *personally* 
<br>
rejected such things. And a necessary place to start the why is
<br>
it wrong might be &quot;is it wrong?R&quot;  (?R - denotes rhetoric 
<br>
question - I don't need convincing. I've done the exercise).
<br>
<p>I have never *personally* inquired into the actual existence of
<br>
gas ovens in Nazi Germany during the war for instance. I
<br>
think in a universe of things one can choose to question or 
<br>
seek further verification of *that* was a pretty bizarre choice.
<br>
I see the mindset that questions the existence of gas ovens in
<br>
Nazi Germany as as bizarre and foreign as the mindset that
<br>
doubts that Armstrong actually walked on the moon.
