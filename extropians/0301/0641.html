<p>
Nathanael wrote an interesting comment about the cost of books.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The local libraries don't have any of the books I've been trying to get. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have the extra cash to constantly buy books at like $20-$30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a piece. If anyone has any other solution to this email me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was wandering if anyone has a bunch of books sitting on a shelf somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they would get rid of at a reasonable price.
</em><br>
<p>This, and perhaps Anders' comments on altruism, started me thinking.
<br>
Of course one of the barriers to transhumanistic development is a
<br>
lack of access to the resources required to develop thinking in
<br>
these areas.  After all, look at what was required to spread
<br>
&quot;religions&quot; (*not* that I am comparing Extropianism or Transhumanism
<br>
to &quot;religions&quot;).  It required widespread availability of books like
<br>
the Bible or the Koran.  [One could probably counter-argue that
<br>
Catholicism and/or Islam were spread mostly by the &quot;keepers of the
<br>
faith&quot;, but for this discussion lets assume that having access to
<br>
&quot;the word&quot; promotes its dissemination.]
<br>
<p>Now, most town or city libraries are going to have relatively few of
<br>
the works we consider important (see for example many of the books
<br>
on the ExI reading list or my personal reading list).  University
<br>
Libraries may be somewhat better, but many fewer people have access
<br>
to them.  It would be a highly interesting exercise to determine what
<br>
fraction of perhaps several thousand college or university libraries
<br>
in the U.S. have copies of either Nanosystems or Nanomedicine.
<br>
[Someone who considers themself a hot-shot programmer, could whip
<br>
up a perl script that could query all of the online catalogs and
<br>
answer this question and *really* impress me!].  Now I happen to
<br>
own 3 and 2 copies of these books respectively, though 1 copy of
<br>
each happens to be in Moscow where I don't have easy access to
<br>
them currently.  But the point remains that I have copies of many
<br>
extropic/transhumanist books, some read, some unread, that I would
<br>
be more than happy to share on a temporary basis if the costs can
<br>
be made low enough.
<br>
<p>Enter [stage left] National and International ExI Lending Libraries...
<br>
<p>What I am thinking is something like this:
<br>
<p>We try to develop a system that strikes a balance between the people
<br>
who are resource (e.g. book) rich, but time poor with the people who
<br>
are relatively cost constrained but time rich.
<br>
<p>I have a lot of books (really more than most people can imagine
<br>
quantities of books).  Many of these are elements of the extropic
<br>
reading list, others are scientific &amp; technical as well as college
<br>
textbooks (unfortunately it would probably take weeks for me to
<br>
create a complete online list).  In addition, at least in the U.S.
<br>
there is a 4th class book shipment rate that is relatively inexpensive.
<br>
Books don't ship fast, but they get there eventually.  Finally, since
<br>
I send and receive most of my mail via a P.O. Box (a very good strategy
<br>
for people prominent in the extropic/transhumanist community who think
<br>
there is even a slight chance that they might become targets for any
<br>
loony-toons luddite who can get their home mailing address out of
<br>
easily accessed credit records).  So I'm frequently at the post office
<br>
and picking something up or dropping something off isn't a significant
<br>
additional [time] cost to me (at least while I continue to live in Seattle).
<br>
<p>So, how would this work?  It looks to me like someone who wants to borrow
<br>
a book, should:
<br>
a) be willing to pay the postage (to send/receive the book).
<br>
b) probably be willing to send a &quot;sticky&quot; mailing label with the request
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a book.
<br>
c) agree to a period for the book &quot;loan&quot; (1-2 months perhaps based on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book page count/technical difficulty?).
<br>
d) agree to pay fines to ExI if they do not return the book on time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;($0.10/day?).  [Without negative consequences some of us may not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behave properly.]
<br>
<p>Now, the interesting thing about this is that I suspect without too
<br>
much difficulty, it ought to be possible to develop a distributed
<br>
lending library system.  The only thing I see as potentially difficult
<br>
is lowering international shipping costs/bureaucracy such that it becomes
<br>
feasible to do this across country borders.
<br>
<p>Now, one of the interesting things about this, that might have to be
<br>
discussed, is the fact that one may receive the high-lighting, margin
<br>
notes, etc. of the owner of the circulating copy of a text.  Then there
<br>
is the problem of how one contributes to this.  What I have read of
<br>
Greg Stock's &quot;Redesigining Humans&quot; was in the copy Carol Tilly loaned
<br>
to me.  I had to read it with an extra pad where I could note pages
<br>
and comments such as -- no/wrong/short-sighted/etc. to avoid defacing
<br>
Carol's copy.  But I would like to think that some people would be
<br>
interested in what I think is important in a text -- at the same time
<br>
I'd be fascinated by comments that Anders, Damien, Max, Greg, Robin, etc.
<br>
would make on a text (since their perspectives are quite orthogonal to mine).
<br>
Obviously this gets problematic after a text has been sent out 10+ times.
<br>
<p>Normal &quot;reviews&quot; don't cut the mustard.  You have to be able to delve
<br>
down into the specific points of an argument and point out precisely
<br>
*where* it is on swampy ground.  Reading an article or book so annotated
<br>
is *much* more educational.  It raises the interesting question as
<br>
to whether the extropic/transhumanist vector should be to read a
<br>
&quot;virginal&quot; book or an &quot;annotated&quot; book.
<br>
<p>I do not know if the implementation of something like this is feasible.
<br>
I do know I'm willing to help explore it if others are.
<br>
<p>Robert
