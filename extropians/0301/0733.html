Samantha writes in &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So is there any basis to a claim that the rights recognized by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;a Western nation&quot; are better than the ones recognized (or not) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by other nations?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you believe that claimed is based on other than your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference?  [Yes]  If so, then what is that basis?
</em><br>
<p>Well, as I've mentioned, our modern Western nations
<br>
are able to confer greater benefits on their citizens,
<br>
and not from stealing from other countries, but rather
<br>
through greater capacity for organized production and
<br>
distribution.  Then, as many authors I've cited, e.g.
<br>
William Easterly and Mancur Olson explain, it also
<br>
happens that the ability to be so provident relies
<br>
directly upon the legal rights the citizens enjoy.
<br>
<p>Okay, so a rather small fraction of human beings has
<br>
been able the last few centuries to advance culturally
<br>
to the point that the protection of these legal rights
<br>
becomes possible.  Okay, the even smaller fraction
<br>
of those countries that consistently protect private
<br>
property, enforce contracts, and safeguard individual
<br>
legal rights continue to outperform those countries
<br>
which do not.  And somehow all this is taken as a
<br>
discovery of &quot;natural rights&quot; that had been there
<br>
all along?
<br>
<p>Here is what &quot;natural rights&quot; are to Mike Lorrey:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Natural Rights are those legal liberties which the evolutionary history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human culture has demonstrated provide superior selection, survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of both the individual and the society in which the individual resides.
</em><br>
<p>Lee Daniel Crocker didn't give such a concise characterization
<br>
(so far as I can find) but did say
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human brains are connected in ways we can observe, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-level behaviors have high-level consequences we can observe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we can generalize which of those behaviors lead to results we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor.  &quot;Natural rights&quot; is just a convenient notation, and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no more (and no less) &quot;fictional&quot; than lift or boiling points.
</em><br>
<p>and Samantha (above) who says (paraphrased)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A natural right is a property of the sentient being concerned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to its specific nature and the needs implied by that nature 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in social groupings.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps many would agree with Mike's, so please observe
<br>
that he's quite wrong:  human culture has *not* demon-
<br>
strated that these legal liberties provide superior
<br>
selection, survival, and so on (except quite recently,
<br>
and for just a few people).  These legal liberties
<br>
are a property of our civilization, not our DNA.  It's
<br>
still a massive epistemological error, IMO, to keep
<br>
imputing these &quot;properties&quot; of sentient beings as
<br>
being in any way independent of the historical
<br>
situation in which the human beings find themselves.
<br>
<p>When, lastly, I wrote on this subject, I mentioned six
<br>
books I've read or re-studied recently that deal with
<br>
what I think are the relevant themes.  They were
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge and Decisions, by Thomas Sowell
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Origins of Virtue, by Matt Ridley
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fatal Conceit, by F.A. Hayek
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power and Prosperity, by Mancur Olsen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mystery of Capital, by Hernando De Soto
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carnage and Culture, by Victor Davis Hanson
<br>
<p>I now find that I could name another half dozen
<br>
seemingly relevant works that also fail to contain
<br>
&quot;natural rights&quot; or &quot;natural law&quot; in the index.
<br>
Even David Friedman is rather dismissive of the
<br>
concept in the chapter &quot;Problems&quot; of The
<br>
Machinery of Freedom (though I have not
<br>
read all that book), and he doesn't consider
<br>
it worthwhile to put either concept in the
<br>
index either.  And, from google, &quot;David Friedman's
<br>
latest book, Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday
<br>
Life, argues for freedom on purely economic, rather
<br>
than moral or natural-law grounds...&quot;
<br>
<p>IF they are so great, so indispensable, then
<br>
please also tell me in which of the fifty (!)
<br>
books on the extropian reading list
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/shop/index.html">http://www.extropy.org/shop/index.html</a>
<br>
these important concepts, natural law, and
<br>
natural rights, are discussed!
<br>
<p>As I wrote yesterday:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is going on?  Must one look back into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dusty books written by 19th century historians,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or highly theoretical works by way-out libertarians?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of the most modern and pressing expositions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appear to give any credence to this concept.
<br>
<p>No one answered.
<br>
<p>Lee
