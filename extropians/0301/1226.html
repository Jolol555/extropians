Kai Becker writes: [The U.S.] First world?  A president not elected by the 
<br>
majority of the voters.
<br>
<p>Kai,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why I usually suggest that as a German or other non American 
<br>
you should stay out of heavy discussions of American internal affairs.  You 
<br>
are certainly welcome to listen and to ask questions, perhaps to even 
<br>
contrast what we tell you with the German system but please don't make flat 
<br>
statements of fact like the one above.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are plainly uninformed let me explain our vote counting 
<br>
procedure in broad terms.  You could validate what I am about to tell you if 
<br>
you had the time to come over and observe a Presidential election up close 
<br>
and personal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Presidential elections are held on an electorial college basis.  
<br>
As each states votes are tallied we determine who won the electoral votes for 
<br>
each individual state.  The electors go to Washington and cast the final 
<br>
votes, the winner gets to become the President.  That man in 2000 AD was 
<br>
George W. Bush.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to the tally of the individual votes for President.  What happens 
<br>
in each state is that when we start counting the votes we know the total 
<br>
number of votes, at least approximately, before we know the voting outcome.  
<br>
As the tally progresses we often reach a point where one man is going to win 
<br>
even if all the remaining votes go to his opponent.  At that point we often 
<br>
or maybe even usually quit as the remaining votes will not change the outcome 
<br>
even if, to remind you, all of them go to one candidate.  We turn in the vote 
<br>
we have and that is that.  The uncounted votes are eventually simply 
<br>
discarded and never totalled at all.  I don't know if this is always the case 
<br>
in all voting jurisdictions but it is very typical.  In this last election 
<br>
after election reports say that several million votes disappeared.  
<br>
Percentage wise they were too few to change anything so far as the electorial 
<br>
vote is concerned.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Bush clearly won by the electorial system that is our lawful 
<br>
system and which we have used for roughly 210 years.  You can cry about that 
<br>
but it is the lawful system and eventually everyone gets to find themselves 
<br>
on both sides of the question.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at that time we looked to see how the popular vote turned out.  
<br>
We always do this after every election.  Naturally when the Democrats saw the 
<br>
results they screamed triumphantly that their man had won the popular vote.  
<br>
They have been repeating that observation every since.  It will probably go 
<br>
down in the history books that way.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, think of those millions of votes that were discarded.  No one 
<br>
knows how that count would have gone as they were never counted.  In fact we 
<br>
don't know who would have won the popular vote had all the individual votes 
<br>
been counted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do know it makes no difference to the result of the election.  The 
<br>
next question is should we switch from the electoral system to a straight 
<br>
popular vote?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was on my High School debate team when we debated that very question 
<br>
in the school year of 1949-50.  I debated in favor of changing to a popular 
<br>
vote.  But frankly the question isn't all that clear.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One good thing about the electorial system is that it is designed to 
<br>
be a winner take all system resulting in very few close elections.  Instead 
<br>
when all is said and done it produces some very one sided results.  A popular 
<br>
vote would mean counting millions of votes and possibly have the result hang 
<br>
on very few votes -- I can imagine that turning into a nightmare.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So please don't say that Bush lost the popular vote -- the fact is we 
<br>
don't know who won.
<br>
Ron h.
