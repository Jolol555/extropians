<em>&gt;&gt; All creatures have a natural right to struggle to better their own

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a little circular, of course  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Not really. If I claimed that squares have four and only four
<br>
perpendicular angles, because that is what it means to be a square, I
<br>
think you would probably reply that my argument was &quot;a little circular.&quot;
<br>
But actually my argument would be very square. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you are lost and hungry in the desert then you have a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right to kill and eat rattlesnakes.  But don't be fooled into
</em><br>
thinking
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rattlesnakes don't also have a natural right to defend themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then why doesn't everything we do---since we are biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms---fall under this rubric? 
</em><br>
<p>It does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; E.g., Adolph Hitler had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a natural right to feed upon all his countless victims.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, after all, speaking scientifically here.
</em><br>
<p>Hitler's victims had a natural right to defend themselves. It's a damned
<br>
shame that they were denied their rights to do so. 
<br>
<p>As I wrote in the message to which you are replying, the world is
<br>
inherently unjust. But the injustice of the world does not imply the
<br>
non-existence of natural rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; For example, it's not been found in our DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; On the contrary, it is the very essence of our DNA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you therefore expect that the next robot I design,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which flees from lights and moving objects and feeds upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unguarded electricity outlets to have its own &quot;natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right&quot; to that electricity?  (Just as I have a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to hunt my critter down and turn it back into spare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts?)
</em><br>
<p>Yes. 
<br>
<p>It would be part of its nature to seek electricity outlets to survive.
<br>
No organism, organic or inorganic, need make excuses for pursuing its
<br>
own survival. 
<br>
<p>At the same time, organisms in need of that same electricity source
<br>
would have a natural right to defend their access to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So then we can find in my computer code that natural right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as we find in DNA our natural right?  Preposterous.
</em><br>
<p>I see nothing preposterous about it.
