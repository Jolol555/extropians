<em>&gt; &gt; I can appreciate Patti Smith's singing voice but the folks behind the

<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;anti-war&quot; movement are an interesting hodge-podge of voices.  Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this LA Weekly piece is dated November 2002, it describes some of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people I am watching this morning on C-Span.  Nadia Marsh (Doctors and Nurses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Against War) is married to Brian Becker, a key WWP (Workers World Party)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organizer.  The WWP supports Kim Jong-Il's &quot;socialist country&quot; and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isolation from the global economic system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look, I was at one of the major rallies.  The celebs have almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to do with it.  I met all sorts of people, people of all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; races, ages, political persuasions.  Most of them were not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;peaceniks&quot; even.  They are simply American citizens that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider this proposed war to be wrong and intend to make their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voices heard.  How about noting that this is the people, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which this country is supposed to be about, of and for, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressing itself instead of pretending their voices are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illegitimate?  To do otherwise would be dishonest.
</em><br>
<p>I, for one, would never say these voices &quot;illegitimate&quot;, yet
<br>
information about organizer's backgrounds, or web-site's
<br>
owners are supplementary to full understanding, and are
<br>
relevant.
<br>
<p>What I have always wondered about is a Kantian take on
<br>
all this:  what if everyone took to the streets to make
<br>
their voices and views on issues heard?  What if all
<br>
the racists in the U.S., for example, marched to support
<br>
their right to their own beliefs?
<br>
<p>I've never understood why people can't simply do as I
<br>
do, and cooperatively express their views in the voting
<br>
booth?  And if they have more energy and time than it
<br>
takes for than, then in discussions with others, and in
<br>
writing articles and books?
