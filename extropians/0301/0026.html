<p>
There is a good op-ed article in the Los Angeles Times this morning,
<br>
by Michael Shermer of Skeptic magazine.  Because you need to register
<br>
in order to read it, I am including it in full below.
<br>
<p>This is the strongest support for cloning (actually, probably just
<br>
about the only article supporting it) that I have seen in a mainstream
<br>
publication.  Most of his points are similar to what we have made here:
<br>
that clones would be people deserving of full human rights, and not some
<br>
kind of biological products or mechanisms.  But in the end he takes
<br>
a view that is probably even stronger than many here would support.
<br>
He concludes, &quot;Let's run the cloning experiment and see what happens.&quot;
<br>
<p>Given the nature of the opposition to the human cloning claims, I am
<br>
coming around to Shermer's position.  It is very disturbing to see how
<br>
people are trying to frame the debate.  Especially as we look beyond
<br>
simple human cloning to the next major step, genetic engineering, we
<br>
can't allow the issues to be discussed in these terms.  If the question
<br>
is whether we are playing God, we can't win, because we are playing
<br>
God in the sense these people mean it.  We have to follow Shermer's
<br>
argument and trump this point by explaining that Man has been playing
<br>
God throughout the history of modern medicine.
<br>
<p>It will be tragic if the cloned children suffer from medical problems.
<br>
But we don't stop people with hereditary illnesses from having children,
<br>
and their kids also face an increased risk of problems.  Instead,
<br>
we try to help the parents and children.  We offer genetic counseling.
<br>
We offer therapeutic interventions.  And in the future, we will have even
<br>
more effective medical technologies to help.  If the cloned children
<br>
suffer complications, that will be all the more motivation to develop
<br>
the technology to heal them, and to heal other people as well.
<br>
<p>In the next few decades, medicine will advance tremendously.  Even if the
<br>
new reproductive technologies create problems, let's dedicate ourselves to
<br>
fixing them.  As Extropians I think we can and should support technologies
<br>
which expand the range of options available to humanity, and human cloning
<br>
is an important example.  I will follow Shermer's lead and take a more
<br>
positive role in supporting human cloning technology and other advanced
<br>
reproductive interventions.

<em>&gt; Wake Up, Cloning's Day Has Come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Michael Shermer, Michael Shermer is the publisher of Skeptic magazine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ever since scientists in the 1970s first began cloning experiments on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple organisms, ethicists and lawmakers have been wringing their hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Ludditean fear and existential angst over what to do when cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology approaches the human barrier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On Friday, Brigitte Boisselier, the scientific director of Clonaid --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with the Raelians, a group that believes that life was seeded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Earth by aliens from other worlds -- announced that her team had done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just that with a 31-year-old American woman who, they claim, gave birth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the world's first human clone, nicknamed, appropriately, Eve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether the Raelians succeeded is irrelevant.  It is clear that someone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere, some time soon is going to generate a human clone.  And once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that happens, others will be quick to follow through the door and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will learn whether medical complications make cloning impractical as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of fertility enhancement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I find disturbing is not cloning per se but three fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myths about it: the Identical Personhood Myth; the Playing God Myth;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Human Rights and Dignity Myth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Identical Personhood Myth is perpetuated by those who say: &quot;It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a horrendous crime to make a copy of someone.&quot; But what they should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying is: &quot;Clone all you like; you'll never produce another you because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment matters as much as heredity.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best scientific evidence to date indicates that roughly half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variance between humans is accounted for by genetics; the balance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by environment.  Because it is impossible to duplicate the near-infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of environmental permutations that go into producing an individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human being, cloning is no threat to unique personhood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Playing God Myth has numerous promoters, the latest being Stanley
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M. Hauerwas, a professor of theological ethics at Duke University who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded to the Clonaid announcement with this unequivocal denouncement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The very attempt to clone a human being is evil. The assumption that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we must do what we can do is fueled by the Promethean desire to be our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own creators.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is not alone in his belief. A 1997 Time/CNN poll, conducted on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heels of the news that a cloned sheep, Dolly, had been born, revealed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 74% of Americans said it was &quot;against God's will&quot; to clone human beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But cloning scientists don't want to play God any more than fertility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctors do. What's godly about in vitro fertilization, embryo transfer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other fully sanctioned birth enhancement technologies?  Absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing. Yet we cheerfully accept these advances because we are accustomed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Human Rights and Dignity Myth is embodied in the Roman Catholic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Church's official statement against cloning, based on the belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it denies &quot;the dignity of human procreation and of the conjugal union.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same sentiment is also found in a Sunni Muslim cleric's demand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;science must be regulated by firm laws to preserve humanity and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dignity.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reality is that clones will be no more alike than twins raised in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate environments, and no one is suggesting that twins do not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights or dignity, or that twinning should be banned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the interest of assuaging these and other fears, I propose the Three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laws of Cloning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * A human clone is a human being no less unique in his or her personhood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than an identical twin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * A human clone is a human being with all the rights and privileges that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompany this legal and moral status.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * A human clone is a human being to be accorded the dignity and respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due any member of our species.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of restricting or banning cloning, I propose that we adopt the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Three Laws of Cloning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The soul of science is found in courageous thought and creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment, not in restrictive fear and prohibitions. For science to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress it must be given the opportunity to succeed or fail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's run the cloning experiment and see what happens.
