### Not being a lawyer, my opinion here might of little value, however, I
<br>
feel that your call for legal action is unwarranted. AFAIK, reckless
<br>
endangerment cannot be defined unless there is a sufficient body of evidence
<br>
regarding the behavior in question, and we have no data to qualify cloning
<br>
as endangering the child - the problems from non-human cloning are perhaps
<br>
suggestive but not necessarily sufficient. I'd think that a lawyer with
<br>
experience in cases based on wrongful birth, as well as civil liability in
<br>
pharma industry, would have to provide us with information on the current
<br>
state of legal thinking here. Also, liability for support and medical care
<br>
would arise only if the child is indeed sick, and there is sufficient
<br>
evidence that the cloning procedure resulted in it. Punitive damages also
<br>
cannot be too liberally applied, usually gross negligence or malice are
<br>
necessary before they are awarded.
<br>
<p>Deviation from the principles I alluded to above, especially the need for
<br>
sufficient evidence, questions of informed consent and liability of the
<br>
parents, is a very bad idea - there are counties where women are deprived of
<br>
obstetrical care as a result of frivolous lawsuits against physicians. To
<br>
support the starting the war on cloning using these legal weapons, is like
<br>
calling for the use of nuclear weapons to eradicate highway speeding - might
<br>
be somewhat effective, but the fallout could be more than you are bargaining
<br>
for.
