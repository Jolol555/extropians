</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope.  I also wouldn't be comfortable at all with Bush (Sr. or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jr.), Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld or a host of others.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, did they happen to kill their elementary school teachers
<br>
when they were eleven, too?  Are you truly interested in Saddam's
<br>
personal history?  If you do become knowledgeable about exactly
<br>
what kind of person Hussein is, get back to me about how comfortable
<br>
you'd be with him as a neighbor, as, compared to, say, Bush.

<p><em>&gt; - Why can't we cooperate?  What's the story with the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation gig, anyway?  Why do we get bucketloads of implicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and explicit nationalism and jingoism on extro-l of all places?
</em><br>
<p>As for the latter, the reason why is the same reason it
<br>
most always turns out to be: because evolution built us
<br>
that way.  Less grandly, and more specifically, those
<br>
tribes that did not have members whose patriotism was
<br>
not easily aroused were non-competitive and did not survive.
<br>
<p>We *do* wish to move towards more inclusiveness, less alienation
<br>
and conflict.  In fact, history has been a story of precisely
<br>
this progress.  But it won't do to pretend that it can all be
<br>
just swept away by an effort of will---we absolutely must
<br>
*appreciate* the reasons for the existence of &quot;explicit nationalism
<br>
and jingoism&quot;.  And they're not all lamentable ones, nor regrettable
<br>
ones.
<br>
<p>As realists, it is incumbent upon us to both recognize and
<br>
*appreciate* what is really behind things we despise, such
<br>
as war and racism.  It absolutely WILL NOT DO to assume that
<br>
we are *above* all that, or that by simply thinking good
<br>
thoughts and practicing our abstract moral principles it
<br>
will accomplish anything more than a transitory boost to
<br>
our egos.
<br>
<p>Your questions, &quot;why can't we cooperate&quot;, &quot;what's the story
<br>
behind nations, anyway&quot; are good questions.  But you probably
<br>
could figure out many of the reasons yourself, if you'd just
<br>
allow yourself to do so, because you've probably already
<br>
studied enough anthropology and history to get an idea.
<br>
<p>Do you equally wonder why primitive animals tried to kill 
<br>
and eat each other in Earth's a half billion years ago?
<br>
&quot;Why couldn't they just get along?&quot;, (to use Rodney King's
<br>
memorable phrase).
