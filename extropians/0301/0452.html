<em>&gt;&gt;Another somewhat saturnine observation: it's another nail in the coffin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of hobby electronics--
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.  This is the best thing that could happen to hobby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electronics.
</em><br>
<p>We'll see. If the cost per CC drops to some reasonable value, then the &quot;fab&quot;
<br>
side of personal electronics of course becomes easier.
<br>
<p>But exploration and design get harder; thus my comment about desktop tomography.
<br>
<p>Making the first thingy has a _big_ implementation hump when you compare it to
<br>
plugging stuff in a solderless breadboard, to cite a technology from the 1970s.
<br>
<p>In the present day, look at doing a PIC-based project vs. wiring random logic.
<br>
Factor in the failure modes of firmware. It ain't the same, and maybe never can be.
<br>
Getting your hands on things helps to get your brains on. Or so I claim. I think there
<br>
is a lot of hapticity that goes away when you delegate too much to a Desktop Santa.
<br>
<p>Also, right now, the impending outlawing of lead-based solder
<br>
(well underway in the EC, and expected here any day) is having some chilling
<br>
effect on old-style electronics hacking.
<br>
<p>Then again, I bet there was a period of time when just about _nobody_ was making really
<br>
high-quality buggy whips--to use the wheezy analogy. Ham radio is in the dumper because
<br>
IRC Chat and its sequelae made it largely culturally irrelevant. Ave atque vale.
<br>
<p>But mostly, I suspect there is a bit of migration away from actualy _doing_
<br>
hands-on stuff. &quot;'Go Do' Considered Shameful&quot; by John Walker was published
<br>
over 10 years ago, and it's still salient. The cultural bloom (in
<br>
the algal sense) left over from the boom.bust accentuates matters.
<br>
I look at the falling enrollments in engineering schools and
<br>
I wonder, glumly.
<br>
<p>There's also the huge gap between what was considered cool when I was growing
<br>
up vs. what's considered cool now. Hard to homebrew a P4 mobo--impossible to do it
<br>
with a solderless breadboard.
<br>
<p>That sort of stuff might still become part of, e.g., open hardware designs suitable for
<br>
Desktop Santa fab.  And I hope so. But for now we are still waiting for the bus.
<br>
<p>Now, contrariwise and counterpoint:
<br>
<p>I wish I had real data on the cultural impact of LEGO Mindstorms.
<br>
<p>Something like that approach, tied in with Desktop Santa, could be verrrry cool for the
<br>
tiny fraction of kids who get one and really dig in. But LEGO Mindstorms seems to have
<br>
sunk without a trace, apart from some MIT Media Lab and thesis work. Pity.
<br>
<p>Re: what's considered coo:, in software, the Squeak folks are trying with might and main
<br>
to put a stake in the heart of &quot;Hello World.&quot; That's a _good_ thing. I hope for
<br>
the same sort of stuff WRT hardware.
<br>
<p>Note that all my comments are based on the little bit of the world I see.
<br>
There might be a whole crop of kids in Bangalore or Shenzhen who hack their
<br>
brains out (metaphorically speaking). If so, Ghu bless 'em.
