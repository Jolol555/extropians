<em>&gt; Sir,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Is it that you cannot read or that you refuse to read?  My 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You like Samantha wish to use these pages to spout slogans instead of

</em><br>
<p>Do you think that you are inside of my head, &quot;sir&quot;?  Do you 
<br>
believe for a moment that you understand the deep abhorrence I 
<br>
felt from watching the horror of Vietnam, what it did to this 
<br>
country or those who came back mangled in body, mind or spirit 
<br>
many of whom I knew and dealt with personally?  Do you imagine 
<br>
for a moment that you utterly understand and appreciate that I 
<br>
honestly and deeply believe that Iraq and the general never 
<br>
ending &quot;war on Terror&quot; is a dreadful and deadly danger to all I 
<br>
and we hold dear?  Iraq is only a beginning, an early &quot;domino&quot;, 
<br>
but the attitudes behind this war must be faced and dealt with 
<br>
as early as possible.  To you really characterize this deep 
<br>
caring and committment to what we claim to believe in as using 
<br>
these pages merely &quot;to spout slogans&quot;?!
<br>
<p><p>This is utterly reprehensible.
