Following my recent review of Pinker's book in The Weekend Australian
<br>
(posted here a couple of days ago), an Aussie commentator fwd'd to the
<br>
editor the following article from the New Yorker in rebuttal. I find some of
<br>
it congenial and persuasive, and much of it tendentious if not absurd. I do
<br>
think it's worth reading closely. It's freely available at
<br>

<br>
WHAT COMES NATURALLY
<br>
by LOUIS MENAND
<br>
Does evolution explain who we are?
<br>
<p>&quot;The new sciences of human nature.&quot; Well, why not? The old sciences of human
<br>
nature didn't have such a fabulous track record. They gave us segregated
<br>
drinking fountains, &quot;invented spelling,&quot; and the glass ceiling?all
<br>
consequences of scientific theories about the way human beings really are.
<br>
Possibly, there is a lesson there, which is that the sciences of human
<br>
nature tend to validate the practices and preferences of whatever regime
<br>
happens to be sponsoring them. In totalitarian regimes, dissidence is
<br>
treated as a mental illness. In apartheid regimes, interracial contact is
<br>
treated as unnatural. In free-market regimes, self-interest is treated as
<br>
hardwired. Maybe this is unfair to the new sciences of human nature, though.
<br>
It could be that the problem with the old sciences was simply that they
<br>
weren't scientific enough?that they were mostly wishful thinking projected
<br>
onto dubious data about skull size and the effects of estrogen on the
<br>
ability to balance a checkbook. Today's scientists might have the capacity
<br>
to get right down there among the chromosomes and the neurotransmitters, and
<br>
to send back reports, undistorted by fear, favor, or the prospect of
<br>
funding, about what's going on. Maybe the new sciences of human nature are
<br>
really scientific. It's worth a look.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steven Pinker is a psychology professor at M.I.T. and the author of an
<br>
entertaining and popular book on language (his specialty), called &quot;The
<br>
Language Instinct,&quot; and a more wide-ranging volume, also popular, called
<br>
&quot;How the Mind Works.&quot; His new book, &quot;The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of
<br>
Human Nature&quot; (Viking; $27.95), recycles some of the material published in
<br>
&quot;How the Mind Works&quot; but puts it to a more prescriptive use. Pinker has a
<br>
robust faith in &quot;the new sciences of human nature&quot; (his phrase)?he was
<br>
formerly the director of M.I.T.'s Center for Cognitive Neuroscience?but his
<br>
views in &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; are based almost entirely on two branches of the
<br>
new sciences: evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are both efforts to explain mind and behavior biologically, as
<br>
products of natural selection and genetic endowment. Unless you are a
<br>
creationist, there is nothing exceptionable about the approach. If opposable
<br>
thumbs are the result of natural selection, there is no reason not to assume
<br>
that the design of the brain is as well. And if we inherit our eye color and
<br>
degree of hairiness from our ancestors we probably inherit our talents and
<br>
temperaments from them, too. The question isn't whether there is a
<br>
biological basis for human nature. We're organisms through and through;
<br>
biology goes, as they say, all the way down. The question is how much
<br>
biology explains about life out here on the twenty-first-century street.
<br>
[etc etc]
<br>
<p>===========
<br>
<p>I commented in response:
<br>
<p>I agree, of course, with much of Menand's commentary; Pinker is a
<br>
philistine, for example. But many of Menard's shots are as cheap as they
<br>
come. `Either human beings spent ten thousand years denying their own nature
<br>
by slavishly obeying the whims of the rich and powerful, cheerfully burning
<br>
heretics at the stake, and arranging their daughters' marriages (which would
<br>
imply a pretty effective system of socialization), or modern liberal society
<br>
is largely a social construction.' Both are likely to be the case; the
<br>
phylogenetic history of humans is rather longer than 10,000 years, more than
<br>
100 times longer, and it is that dominant environment of evolutionary
<br>
adaptation that Pinker and his ev psych associates speak of, as both you and
<br>
Menard must be aware. One might argue that we know nothing directly of it,
<br>
or that its invocation is an opportunity for Just So stories, etc--but the
<br>
scale of the thing *has* to be reckoned with, not dismissed with a (rather
<br>
ponderous) quip.
