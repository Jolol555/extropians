<p>Yep, the dogs of war unleashed for a pretext that was arguably 
<br>
not what it appeared to be and/or inadequate for justification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not going to try to justify the current U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy with respect to Iraq (or North Korea).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I'm not sure they can be presented in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rational manner.  But Spike's recent note on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear weapons propagation and use raises the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; red flag.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are other ways to address nuclear proliferation than 
<br>
blowing hell out of various nations.  Too aggressive and 
<br>
destructive actions lead to more impetus *for* proliferation and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even use, not less.  When Britain and the US say they will 
<br>
consider preemptive strikes and also say they will not rule out 
<br>
using nukes do you think most of the countries of the world 
<br>
would be more or less interesting in having nukes to deter such 
<br>
madness?  This red flag by itself does not say what we should 
<br>
most reasonably do about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Precisely how bad do things have to get before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one says &quot;you may not cross this line&quot;?  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then are you willing to suffer the consequences

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am unwilling to dole out and suffer &quot;unending war&quot; with its 
<br>
likely disasterous effect on extropic values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As much as I may not (currently) be fond of utilitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments I think I am being forced into the position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalizing and justifying them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To remove the debate from it current &quot;political&quot; climate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how on earth could we have allowed the genocide of over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a million people in Rwanda?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [<a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/bush/rwandadeaths.htm">http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/bush/rwandadeaths.htm</a>]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We weren't interested in that patch of real estate is how.  To 
<br>
be blunt.  Do you believe that we should be the police of the 
<br>
world?  That itself is a position of questionable extropic value.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The non-U.S. members of the extropian list don't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to beg off on this because the U.N. provides, if anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a forum for third parties to raise voices of concern and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outrage.  [Where were you?]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Where were you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, I would urge all people who consider themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extropic&quot; to consider long and hard the question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when their arguments and efforts really are likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to save or produce the greatest amount of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. are most anti-entropic).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Wars are generally un-extropic unless they directly protected 
<br>
what is very valuable.  Killing people, especially large numbers 
<br>
of people is generally un-extropic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This isn't about being &quot;right&quot;, it isn't about advancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones own political perspective (the entire libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. some other political framework fades and exits stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left in this forum), it isn't about whether having or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not having guns is a way to move forward a perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is about whether or not the information content that we,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a species and civilization, have accumulated, is maintained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hopefully evolved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Politics cannot be exclude and indeed must be involved in 
<br>
questions of mass social action.  It is after all its domain. 
<br>
But I agree it is not about lesser issues.  However, I don't 
<br>
believe you can evaluate the killing of this or that group based 
<br>
on which one has denser &quot;information&quot; that might maybe have a 
<br>
better chance of being preserved if the other group was killed 
<br>
or seriously decimated.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That is what &quot;EXTROPY&quot; is about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>No, it isn't.
