<br>
interests without consideration of anyone else, yes, that is frightening.  We 
<br>
have words for people who think only about their own interests and have much 
<br>
more power than others. &quot;Sociopaths&quot;.  &quot;Brutal dictators&quot;.  &quot;Saddam Hussein&quot;.
<br>
<p>As an old friend of mine used to say, &quot;Lord love a duck.&quot;  George Bush 
<br>
through his staff and cabinet officers have been talking to everyone on the 
<br>
face of the globe.  Even while in the middle of this threat they have had 
<br>
time to notice what is going on in Africa with the Aids epidemic, to chart a 
<br>
course and report to our country that we should participate in the response 
<br>
to that epidimic in a big way.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how can you respond in the fashion you just have?  If you didn't 
<br>
intend that comment to apply to the US you sure haven't indicated so.  If you 
<br>
did intend for your comment to apply to the US you certainly haven't 
<br>
justified your position given what we see happening in the real world.  Uncle 
<br>
Sugar is still right out there listening to people, helping when he can and 
<br>
full of good will at all times.
