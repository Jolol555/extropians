<p><em>&gt; Incidentally, I feel that &quot;should&quot; is a perfectly good word, and one which

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree completely that &quot;should&quot; is not usually a sign of
<br>
non-realistic thinking, and can almost always be reworded
<br>
towards &quot;approval&quot; and &quot;has been found to work well&quot; and
<br>
&quot;is consistent with normal people's intuitions&quot; and so on.
<br>
<p>I also very much appreciate your effort to restrict yourself
<br>
as much as one can to the observable, within reason.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you really in a position to say that?  You've never explained exactly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you think force is justified... just resorted to your intuitions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about when something is and isn't &quot;your business&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Following PCR conventions, one sees the word &quot;justified&quot; as
<br>
a danger signal, but here too it's easy to see that what you
<br>
mean is probably semantically pretty innocent.  Yes, you're
<br>
absolutely right in that I have not submitted my &quot;Summa
<br>
Prescriptionalia&quot;, a treatise on what one should approve
<br>
of under all possible situations.  But I'm really worried
<br>
that what is and what is not my business may not be possible
<br>
to rationally define.  I see a huge continuum of cases.
<br>
However, what is important is what we enshrine into law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If your intuitions about when something is &quot;your business&quot; end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with you intervening at much the same points as someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervenes depending on their intuitions as to whether something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, as you put it, BAD, then what have you accomplished?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, a great deal has been accomplished!  The whole emphasis
<br>
on when we should intervene has been changed, and, IMO will
<br>
be found to be much more in accordance with practical and
<br>
time-tested laws.  Firstly, however, I note that your paragraph
<br>
mentions nothing about the law---it's as if we are in some
<br>
lawless space colonies, and we are only interested in examining
<br>
what we *approve* of.  But intervention is often an entirely
<br>
different matter!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if &quot;Is it my business?&quot; and &quot;Is it BAD?&quot; are different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitions, what is it that makes one more interesting than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other?
</em><br>
<p>Simply put, it's all about intervention, as you say.
<br>
Specifically, intervening in cases where it is none
<br>
of the law's business.  For example, were they brought
<br>
back to life suddenly, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams
<br>
would look at you incredulously were one to suggest 
<br>
that the government regulate whether you could burn
<br>
a flag or a cross on your own premises.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For me the archetypal example of a communicable moral case for third-party 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervention is where party A is attempting to kill nonconsenting party B. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   In this case, I will, if I can, intervene to prevent A from killing B. 
</em><br>
<p>Next time I'm in south central L.A., I will recall your
<br>
advice, but I may more sensibly conclude that in many
<br>
cases it's none of my business whether one gang-banger
<br>
attacks another.  Now an exception to this might arise
<br>
if we pass laws making it illegal (shudder) for a 
<br>
bystander to fail to become involved.  But do you have
<br>
any examples that sound as though they might trouble me
<br>
concerning my &quot;we mind our own business&quot; attitude?  I
<br>
already discussed Damien's fine example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find your morality strange, Lee, because it seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent.  Why permit a woman to mutilate her baby, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervene against me to stop me from stopping her?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I never said that!  But I can imagine *a* scenario where
<br>
I would intervene.  In our family, say, we've had a lengthy
<br>
debate with my sister who has presented many long and
<br>
rational arguments as to why she should deform her child
<br>
when its born.  It really is the affair of those of us
<br>
living under the same roof and forming our own community
<br>
in a sense.  Suppose that for whatever reason we are brought
<br>
to agree that it's her baby and the rest of us should take
<br>
a hike.  (Possibly it's even in exchange for her letting me
<br>
keep dogs in the back that she considers to be cruel.)  In this
<br>
case, yes, I would intervene to prevent you from sticking your
<br>
nose into our affairs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own argument?  I freely admit that a woman mutilating her baby is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complex case than a woman mutilating an actively protesting adult, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since it involves an attempt to extrapolate forward what the baby would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want,
</em><br>
<p>I suspect that whenever acting &quot;just for someone's own good,
<br>
whether they realize it or not&quot;, gets problematical beyond belief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and since society has an existing concept of parents being allowed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exert control over children (not necessarily a concept I agree with, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but nonetheless a part of contemporary 21st century morality).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in these complex matters we do have to partly rely on
<br>
tradition, and what appears to have been shown to work.
<br>
It's even more difficult across cultural boundaries---some
<br>
recent immigrants to the bay area find their cultures at
<br>
odds with our laws in cases where I think we have too many
<br>
laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But my decision will be based on a moral theory in which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; babies are sentients who may claim my protection, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a parent's property;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we certainly disagree there
<br>
<p><em>&gt; whether the police side with you, or me, will be determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by which moral argument is more successfully communicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to third parties.
</em><br>
<p>No.  How the laws are written, and hence who the police
<br>
will side with, cannot be settled by moral argument.
<br>
The far less idealistic approach, which has been shown
<br>
to be vastly more workable, has been to observe in what
<br>
ways successful societies seem to maximize benefit and 
<br>
prosperity by having enormous regard for individual
<br>
citizen legal rights, and enormous regard for private
<br>
property.  To be sure, as Hayek explains, we need to
<br>
be open to new experiments and ideas, however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same holds for a sentient in a simulation running on a computer you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose yourself to &quot;own&quot;.  You've gone on record on saying that it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;none of your business&quot; what someone does with &quot;their&quot; simulation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am just as much against ownership of a simulation as I would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the claim that you &quot;owned&quot; the proteins making up a sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you claimed was your &quot;slave&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  Our old argument.  And one can see how it comes down
<br>
to a difference in how societies of equals should function.
<br>
Do you acknowledge the harm of preventing people from running
<br>
extremely numerous simulations, and thus granting run time to
<br>
perhaps trillions of happy people, because of restrictive laws
<br>
and interventions by outsiders?  (Of course *I* admit that in
<br>
a vanishingly few of these simulations, unspeakable horrors
<br>
occur---but that's true in the hell branches of MWI already.)
