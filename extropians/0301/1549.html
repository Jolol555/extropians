<em>&gt; &gt; Wars are won when one side so thoroughly beats the crap out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the other that a state of cognitive shock occurs in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minds of the populace that allows the dislodging of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the unacceptable belief system from their minds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it doesn't always happen like that. Israel has fought 4 major wars and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countless smaller batters with the Arabs in the last 55 years and has won
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every one, usually by a huge margin, but Arabs are still killing Jews.
</em><br>
<p>The Israelis *never* beat the crap out of the Arabs anything
<br>
like what happened to Germany or Japan.  Never were hundreds
<br>
of their cities reduced to rubble, and never were they 
<br>
totally occupied.
<br>
<p>Suppose that Israel had had the resources (and the permission
<br>
from the U.S./U.S.S.R.) to conquer every single country 
<br>
containing significant numbers of Arabs hostile to Israel.
<br>
Suppose further that the Israelis had been as able as the
<br>
U.S. in Germany in arresting, interrogating, and imprisoning
<br>
all Nazis necessary to completely breaking that Party.  Then
<br>
an occupation of the Arab lands for a whole generation would
<br>
have permitted the establishment of western institutions and
<br>
would have, in Mike's memorable phrase &quot;dislodged the
<br>
unacceptable belief system&quot; from their minds.
<br>
<p>The moderate Arabs would soon have been in the overwhelming
<br>
majority, and proceed to feel as bad about their former wars
<br>
on Israel as today's Germans and Japanese feel about their
<br>
World War II aggressions.
<br>
<p>Of course, we can be glad that Israel did not have such
<br>
capabilities, because a million or two Arabs would have
<br>
had to die during the conquest.  But if you are a grieving
<br>
Israeli who has just lost a family member due to terrorism,
<br>
you will not agree with me.  You will see what the U.S.
<br>
did to Japan, and envy the progress that was made their
<br>
despite the cost in lives to everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I want to know after the war is won will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq fracture into chaos like Yugoslavia did.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good question.  It's been pointed out that about
<br>
one-sixth of Iran is not under rule from Baghdad, and is
<br>
doing well, all considered.  An occupation must last
<br>
years or decades to be effective.
