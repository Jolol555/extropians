</em><br>
<p>Are you kidding?  The music industry blames every shortfall, the Iraq
<br>
weapons cache, the current economic downturn and the last ice-age on
<br>
home taping.  They always have and always will, because the
<br>
alternative is to admit that much of the stuff they churn out doesn't
<br>
sell because it's simply bad, and they have terrible taste and no idea
<br>
of what the public actually wants in music, movies, or books.  
<br>
<p>They have fought tooth and nail to prevent CD duplication, and even
<br>
now Sony has a line of CD's that are suppsoed to be dupe-proof.  
<br>
<p>The music industry would in fact like to charge you to record your own
<br>
original music on the basis that it must be related to something you
<br>
heard from one of their artists.  If they could get away with it, they
<br>
no doubt would, and the current climate in the US is tending to
<br>
support some of their more outrageous claims.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Recall that the Film
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry was violently opposed to home VCRs, and even the video industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a whole, claiming that the video industry would inevitably cause the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death of the film industry, whereas the actual outcome was that video
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sales and rentals proved to be the salvation of the film industry.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but not home taping.  There's currently a movement afoot to
<br>
prevent home taping of television shows, and the industry is currently
<br>
suing someone who used the Replay to tape a show and watch it without
<br>
commercials.  The boradcasters feel that they are giving away a
<br>
product that cannot be tampered with.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Likewise Clean flicks and their like will provide a source of revenue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the industry would not otherwise have had.
</em><br>
<p>But not for the originators.  Now, if, say Paramount could get
<br>
permission from the directors to issue a Cleanflicks style version of
<br>
their product, they'd do it in a heartbeat, and I imagine that they
<br>
might just very well try to wring some sort of concessions out of the
<br>
directors/writers/creators to do just that.  Again, with the full
<br>
support of our new corporate-friendly congress here in the good old
<br>
USA.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine a Clean flicks version of Harry Potter with &quot;wizard/witch&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed to &quot;prophet&quot; with the good guys spells in Aramaic or calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon saints, and the bad guys like Voldemort becoming Satanists invoking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Devil for their arts. The Christian Right, who've stayed away from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these films in droves, would approve of such editing, and the story's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core message of friendship, loyalty, and good over evil would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost. No one except the Christian Right would watch such an edited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version, it wouldn't be thrust upon the rest of us, and the studios
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would get royalties they wouldn't otherwise get. I don't see any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downside to this.
</em><br>
<p>The downside is that is the creator of the original character might be
<br>
implacably opposed to having his creation raped to serve the
<br>
indoctrination requirements of the Christian right.  Furthermore, it
<br>
decreases the audience for the original creation, and thus deprives
<br>
the original author of their profits.  Right now, the only place that
<br>
xtians or anyone can get Harry Potter style adventures is from the
<br>
creators of the original characters.  And many of the potential fans
<br>
of the series don't give a rats ass about the xtian message, and
<br>
rightly recognize that the core values of these adventures are pretty
<br>
much outside of organized religion.  So, the kids will watch HP, while
<br>
their parents frothe at the mouth because a potential source of
<br>
propaganda goes by the wayside.  Were someone to take my characters
<br>
and have them mouth xtian -- or any other kind of religion-supporting
<br>
spew, I'd be furious.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For centuries music composers have been in the position that every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artist who performs their composition will place their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation upon it; some interpretations are so radical that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; composition has meanings never intended by the composer. The altering of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Irish anti-war ballad &quot;Johnny I hardly Knew Ye&quot; to the pro-war &quot;When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Johnny Comes Marching Home Again&quot; springs to mind (I use to perform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both; doing the US Civil War version first segwayed into the slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irish version; which I felt gave the latter's anti-war stance a greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact).
</em><br>
<p>This is years after the copyright has expired -- not the same thing as
<br>
altering something currently playing.  This also refers to music. 
<br>
Look at what happened with sampling.  Now if a record uses
<br>
recognizable samples, you can be sure that the original artist is
<br>
identified and recompensed, no matter how much the sample is taken out
<br>
of context and recast in a different mode.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Composers seen their creativity as providing the raw materiel for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity of others. 
</em><br>
<p>No they don't.  They see their creativity as providing a stream of
<br>
income to feed themselves and their families and don't take kindly to
<br>
aomeone else freely lifting their ideas and removing that source of
<br>
income.  The ones who don't mind are, in general dead and without any
<br>
family to profit from their work.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Music industry recognizes that stance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploits it now, where once they opposed it: I believe the Film industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will go the same way after a similar initial resistance.
</em><br>
<p>Do you live in the USA?  I don't understand how uyou could believe
<br>
that the music industry supports and exploits this now.  The film
<br>
industry is digging in for the long run.  If they perceive that
<br>
Cleanflicks has a product that could legitemately sell, then, as I
<br>
said above, they'll wring the permission to rape the creation out of
<br>
the directors and writers and do it themslves without the Cleanflicks
<br>
intermediation and appropriation of the studio's profits.  
<br>

<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p>This also seems to have implications for things like the Jar-Jar-free
<br>
re-edit of Star Wars Ep. I that was floating around on the web a few years
<br>
ago. If CleanFlicks wins then anyone can re-edit movies for esthetic
<br>
reasons, not just objectionableness. It could unlock enormous amounts of
<br>
creativity which somehow feels like it ought to be a copyright infringement
<br>
if it isn't.

<p><em>&gt;From another list, Terry Colvin forwarded:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Barbara Blithered: 
</em><br>
....
<br>
<em>&gt; Provided we're not talking about mass censorship, suppression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the original, plagerisation (ie: &quot;passing off&quot;), avoidance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of royalty payments, false accreditation, or pirating;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't see any way to avoid plagiarism or piracy if the
<br>
&nbsp;changes are done without the permission of the creator or
<br>
&nbsp;copyright owner.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As these are folk who would otherwise not view the movie or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchase the DVD/video it's a source of income the studios/
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artists would not otherwise have.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This makes sense if one is only concerned with commerce, but
<br>
&nbsp;when creative works are involved, that's not the only issue. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine a Clean flicks version of Harry Potter with &quot;wizard/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; witch&quot; changed to &quot;prophet&quot; with the good guys spells in Aramaic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or calling upon saints, and the bad guys like Voldemort becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Satanists invoking the Devil for their arts.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;But that's not the story that Rowling wrote, or the movie that
<br>
&nbsp;Waner Bros made.  If someone doesn't like tht story, they have
<br>
&nbsp;the right not to watch it, or to make a story they like.  Some
<br>
&nbsp;have actually tried that (see the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series of books
<br>
&nbsp;and movies).  It's just a lot harder to create comething from
<br>
&nbsp;scratch than to modify someone else's work.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I suspect the issue for many artists is that they don't want
<br>
&nbsp;their names attached to something that has been changed so that
<br>
&nbsp;it doesn't necessarily reflect their intentions and views.  I
<br>
&nbsp;know I'd be miffed if someone turned some story I might write
<br>
&nbsp;into some obvious religious propaganda.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Snopes has a point about skipping or reprogramming songs sequences
<br>
&nbsp;from albums, but the situation is a bit different.  There's
<br>
&nbsp;a long tradition, known and accepted by most performers, that
<br>
&nbsp;songs are performed as individual works, separate from the album. 
<br>
&nbsp;There are singles, live performances, and song compilations that
<br>
&nbsp;have all established the idea that the work is a collection of
<br>
&nbsp;individual items, rather than an indivisible cohesive work.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Some artists disagree for certain works, and have expressed that
<br>
&nbsp;by refusing to allow some songs to be used in compilations.  Some
<br>
&nbsp;also have put out LPs that had no banding to separate the songs,
<br>
&nbsp;and later, CDs with no chapter stops.  Some DVDs lately have been
<br>
&nbsp;marketed this way as well.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm not sayig that artistic works are totally sacrosact, but
<br>
&nbsp;someone who creates something has the right to maintain that
<br>
&nbsp;it conveys what it was intended to convey.  Choices were made
<br>
&nbsp;for a reason.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If Rowling wanted the Harry Potter books to be a story of good
<br>
&nbsp;Christians fighting demons, that's what she would have written. 
<br>
&nbsp;The fact that it isn't is a good indicator that that's not the
<br>
&nbsp;story she wanted to tell.
