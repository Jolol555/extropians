<br>
<p>&lt; Low cost titles ($1 or $2) through direct download to blank (digital
<br>
paper) books from personal or small organization websites offer the same
<br>
moneys for authors presently published but otherwise disenfranchised. It is
<br>
conceivable after the introduction of digital paper/ink books by eink etc.
<br>
that individual authors such as Damien Broderick might get buyers in the
<br>
order of 100s or 1,000s and be in a position to more fully support
<br>
themselves as such downloads will be ongoing. &gt;
<br>
<p>While it's true that I don't want people to steal my livelihood, I'm very
<br>
eager to see them get hold of my writing cheaply while still passing along a
<br>
modest, reasonable payment to me and anyone essential to the publication
<br>
loop. Once we have digital paper and easy downloads, all this will be made
<br>
much easier--except that few people will be inclined to pay the producers of
<br>
the information or entertainment they can have for nothing by stealing it.
<br>
<p>I'm making my first moves in this e-book direction very soon, by releasing a
<br>
new novel (co-authored by Rory Barnes) on Richard Curtis's E-Reads, which
<br>
provides both downloads and Print on Demand copies.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ereads.com/index.asp">http://www.ereads.com/index.asp</a>
<br>
<p>This full length novel, FOREVER, is a Singularity-lite romp, and I hope
<br>
plenty of people download it for the modest charge E-Reads will levy. At the
<br>
moment, I have a few out-of-print novels and stories available via
<br>
Fictionwise.com, so far selling a maximum of less than 500 copies (cumulated
<br>
over several years to date), and while that's a nice start it isn't nearly
<br>
enough to live on. If FOREVER had been released in print, it'd cost you $26
<br>
or so (like TRANSCENSION last year, hard cover from Tor); from E-Reads I
<br>
expect it to be considerably less expensive. Of course if everyone just
<br>
*steals* it, Rory and I will've worked hard without pay, and we'll have to
<br>
go into a different line of work to feed and house ourselves. Too bad for
<br>
anyone who likes reading our stuff.
<br>
<p>More news on that e-novel when it happens.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick
