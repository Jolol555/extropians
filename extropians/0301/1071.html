<p>
I noticed in myself an amount of piont scoring. However most people on this 
<br>
list such as myself will admit thier wrong. The only problem is when someone 
<br>
won't admit that. Like holding one to a few &quot;pionts&quot; that evolution doesn't 
<br>
exsist when someone else has over a thousands &quot;pionts&quot; that it does.  This 
<br>
does bring up another argument. What is sufficient evidence? Some type of 
<br>
mathematical formula that would take into account human error and the chance 
<br>
of finding new evidence in opposition. Once a database of all current 
<br>
scientific data is set up the statistics of this should be quite simple.
<br>
<p>The dynamics of back and forth replies is kind of annoying.
<br>
<p>I would favor using an instant messager between two people's full 
<br>
conversation. Then that conversation can be posted as one entry.
<br>
<p>That way the same amount of information can be contained in fewer post. Also 
<br>
each person's conflicting views would be a HUNDRED times easier to identify.
<br>
<p>Doesn't more opposing viewpionts just speed up the process?
<br>
Given the piont that people will admit thier wrong?
<br>
What do you think?
