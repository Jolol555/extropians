<p>Is the point lost on you that at one time some powerful nations

and groups said similar things about the Jewish people?  It is a 
<br>
very dark road that you are contemplating.

<p>Or they don't agree that it is useful to swing to broad a battle

<p><p><em>&gt; America First fascists circa 1939.

<p>Saying that one should take care of one's own business first is

hardly fascism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly this is how I pidgeon-hole the European mentality, and it

<p>This is utterly ridiculous.  You claim those who do not want 
<br>
this very questionable war, much less your even broader 
<br>
conception of it are thereby &quot;Leftists&quot; (whatever the hell that 
<br>
his in your mind) or &quot;Pro-Nazi&quot;?  Do you honestly believe any 
<br>
sane person will accept such an argument?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now the question for you, might be: should you care what

</em><br>
<p><p>You are categorically opposed (apparently) to the existence of 
<br>
large number of others!  You are very hypocritical in this.  You 
<br>
wish to cast all of this in terms of those opposed to your 
<br>
existence and the existence of your people.  Consider for just a 
<br>
moment that this is not so.  At the very least admit the obvious 
<br>
fact that those that disagree with you are not out to 
<br>
exterminate you and your people even when and if you advocate 
<br>
the extermination of others.
