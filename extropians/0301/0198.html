</em><br>
<p>Lee, I don't think this is an accurate summary of the main
<br>
contention of my post at all, indeed its so far off it that I am
<br>
genuinely at a loss as to whether I completely failed to
<br>
communicate or whether you didn't really read what I wrote.
<br>
I did get an offlist message from someone else saying the post
<br>
was good but reading your response I am really wondering
<br>
now what went wrong in the communication process.
<br>
<p>Maybe its me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [Some people] have not yet separated themselves from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superstition and when they stick their uncritical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unweighted, propositions in each others faces they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do so proclaiming all too often, all too proudly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as though it were a great virtue in itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;this is what I  BELIEVE !&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The above is a *caricature*. But by pruning both the
<br>
comment from immediately above it and the sentence from
<br>
below it you've changed the thrust.
<br>
<p>Statistically, I understand, a majority of the worlds population
<br>
is so much into belief and religion and the supernatural that many
<br>
of them think they have another life coming after this one. That imo
<br>
effects the way they make resourcing decisions and do their cost
<br>
benefit analyses to the extent that they do them at all.
<br>
<p>Belief makes for bad social policy.
<br>
<p>I'll continue with this thread, but I want to rebadge it so that I
<br>
don't have to rehash all the stuff in the original again if anyone else is
<br>
interested. (I've added the suffix &quot;- a variant&quot; to the subject line).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is perhaps significant that I don't ever recall anyone using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the word in this manner, and I have even entertained a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of religionists who've knocked at the door.  That is *so*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mindless, that perhaps it's a vanishing usage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IMO, &quot;beliefs&quot;, by their very nature, and as opposed to reasons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are ultimately counter-social.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know what you mean, and you know what I and other sensible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people mean when we say &quot;believe&quot; or &quot;belief&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Respectfully, it is not at all clear to me that you do know what I
<br>
mean yet.
<br>
<p>I need to get to know someone before I give them the benefit of
<br>
the doubt as to having done either qualitative or quantitative analysis
<br>
of any sort *if* they say they have arrived at a position based on
<br>
faith or belief.  Actually if the used the words &quot;arrived at a positon&quot;
<br>
I'd probably raise my evaluation a bit. If they use another word
<br>
instead of believe,  like perceive, think, suspect etc.. I know theres
<br>
&nbsp;a better chance of some sort of personal processing going on. That
<br>
&nbsp;they are not just parroting what they've heard. I guess I apply a
<br>
crude sort of Turing test to people. I suspect that some others that
<br>
have a strong commitment to reason also make assessments on
<br>
the basis of language. Assessments which are not facts, but are
<br>
definately not mere beliefs either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful conveyor of the amount of certainty the speaker feels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One customarily speaks even of &quot;degrees of belief&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Just barely. Its like a worldview with only three switched on the
<br>
dial, yes (knowledge), no (disbelief and no knowledge) and maybe
<br>
(belief). Such a system is better I guess just barely that one that has
<br>
no maybe at all, but I think almost any semi-sentient creature achieves
<br>
the yes, no, maybe level of &quot;sophistication&quot;, whereas homo sapiens
<br>
have, if they chose, at their disposal a much wider range. Probabilities,
<br>
percentiles, cause and effect understanding. Contingency etc. Of course
<br>
they can also choose not to reason something through too.
<br>
<p>Some one who does no better than to believe when reason is
<br>
available in my view is morally copping out in many cases. The
<br>
process of  reasoning is available to normal homo sapiens but it can't
<br>
be engaged simultaneously with the process of believeing. Belief
<br>
starts when reasoning stops. If indeed in some peoples cases, on
<br>
many issues, reason every got out of the starting block in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They build barriers between people.  Whereas reason through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the medium of language can potentially build bridges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really have evidence in your personal life that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people you talk to are handicapped in this way?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to trust you, but it seems to me that this is a nice theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that has no real utility.
</em><br>
<p>I think that is because you are thinking in terms of dialog, not in
<br>
terms of a political discussion where those talking are also aware
<br>
that there are others listening. Often in politics it is for the benefit
<br>
of the undecided listeners not the ostensible adversary (who is
<br>
frequently beyond persuasion, at least in one step, and in a public
<br>
forum with ego invested and face to be saved etc) that one speaks
<br>
as one is after sufficient numbers of voters to achieve an outcome
<br>
and one knows that many of those voters, alas, will make superficial
<br>
judgements or go with mere belief, rather than reason.
<br>
<p>In order to understand what I am saying about belief and why I
<br>
think extropians should not use the word you need to think about
<br>
extropians talking in public forums perhaps debating with people
<br>
with strongly held views to the contrary but with a wide number of
<br>
&quot;undecided&quot;s listening in.
<br>
<p>If the extropian dumbs down his/her language in such a forum to
<br>
include the uncritical word belief and thereby justifies by implication
<br>
the view that beliefs are as good as reasons, the extropian has handed
<br>
over a large part of their natural advantage. The listener(s) hear both
<br>
the extropian and the extropian's adversary talking in terms of belief
<br>
and may get the message that as both sides are talking about beliefs
<br>
they may as well choose whichever uncertainty they like. Hell vote
<br>
for the better looking politician, or the tall one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  For example, people whose thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is screwed up anyway aren't going to be magically helped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dropping a certain term and fishing around for synonyms.
</em><br>
<p>No. To understand my point you need to see I'm thinking like a
<br>
lobbyist and a political activist trying to arm my allies, not like a
<br>
philosopher arguing some esoteric point that doesn't really seem
<br>
to matter to many people at all. I see extropian activities as
<br>
potentially a matter of life and death, I take memes and training in
<br>
&nbsp;memes very seriously. I live in a democracy where &quot;everyone&quot;,
<br>
believers and reasoners (I'm simplifying) each get one vote. And
<br>
the majority of votes make the law irrespective of whether belief
<br>
or reason was used by each of the many voters to make their
<br>
&nbsp;personal &quot;decision&quot;. There are already a swag of folk who
<br>
specialise in collecting believers. I can't stop people believing but
<br>
I don't have to encourage the dumbing down of the population.
<br>
<p>I certainly won't willingly contribute to the view that belief is as
<br>
good and as valid a way of making decisions in the world as
<br>
reason. It isn't. Indeed promoting such a misconception in a
<br>
democracy increases the chances of my premature demise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Please do consider ditching &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beings&quot; from your operating language when other terms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; available.
</em><br>
<p>I'm talking again as a political animal, not merely or mainly a
<br>
philosophical one. I am persuing change and very aware of how
<br>
important it is to win the votes on issues in democracies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you believe in Sapir/Whorf?
</em><br>
<p>No I don't believe in belief. Also I have not heard to my
<br>
recollection of Sapir/Whorf.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  By that I mean the hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our vocabulary and grammar greatly influence our thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>Ok
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I only weakly believe in it; sure, a lot of our thought would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be impossible without language, and I also believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speakers of some languages, e.g. Japanese and French, end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a tiny few differences from those of us who's primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language is English.
</em><br>
<p>Again your not thinking politically, fine, I am.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oops.  Sorry.  I used &quot;the word&quot; twice without realizing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there!  (Yes, the third time was deliberate.)  But you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what I mean.  The purpose of language is to convey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>Of course it must be valid to be able to use the word belief to
<br>
describe when one *is* actually talking about belief itself.
<br>
<p>I was saying one should not hand the believers implicit support
<br>
for abdicating reason, by using the word belief when one actual
<br>
means something far more qualitative and/or quantitatively
<br>
weighted. Use say perceive, suspect, intuit, cognate, etc etc,
<br>
anything that doesn't suggest that belief is a moral equivalent of
<br>
reason in a social world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this is a different matter entirely from my own suggestion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people stop referring to &quot;rights&quot; in the abstract.  I
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; consider that to be an indicator that the speaker believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (sorry) in &quot;Absolute Right and Wrong&quot;, just as if he or she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were relying on Authority.  But I don't care if someone, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, actually uses it in sentences when the meaning steers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear of absolutism.
</em><br>
<p>Neither would I if I was only talking one-on-one and I knew
<br>
what the other meant by the word, because we'd defined it.
<br>
But that is not the case in the political world. Every word
<br>
written on this list is potentially read by many others. There is
<br>
an opportunity to promote good memes here, I suggest we
<br>
use it as well as we can. But more importantly I am suggesting
<br>
we take the tactic of not using the word belief with us out into
<br>
the wider world, and that we also get others to specify what
<br>
they mean when they say belief or believe or faith. Nail the
<br>
dumb anti-social memes right at the outset. But first one
<br>
needs to recognize that they are dumb and anti-social.
<br>
<p>Along with belief, coming fresh from lobbying around the stem
<br>
cell area, I'm keen to have thinking folk purge the terms &quot;human
<br>
life&quot; and &quot;human being&quot; from their reflexive vocabularies too.
<br>
Unless they actually want to include human cancer cells and
<br>
persons in the one class and see no moral distinction as relevant
<br>
or important in today's political environment.
<br>
<p>Sorry just in case that was missed, the pivot point on embryonic
<br>
stem cell research around the world at present (politically)
<br>
speaking is whether an embryo is a human being. Of course
<br>
it is. It exists and its human. Its not a person though. So if we
<br>
don't want to propagate and validate the confusion we'd better
<br>
use the term person and people and personhood or some such
<br>
equivalents when we mean them instead of the less precise terms
<br>
or we are running the risk of helping believers giving us social
<br>
policies whereby actually persons (sick people) cannot be given
<br>
the fullest level of care, because we've traded off their rights as
<br>
a class against the rights of some potential people (embryos) as
<br>
a class.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Brett
<br>
<p>PS: My tenor of reply changed as I moved through your
<br>
reply and replied myself. I think it needed too. I think you
<br>
characterised my meaning incorrectly at the start. Perhaps
<br>
I failed to communicate adequately. I hope I'm doing better
<br>
now.
