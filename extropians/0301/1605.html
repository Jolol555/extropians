How about this augmentation option for someone wishing to appear traditionally human.
<br>
<p>You fill your cells will about 40 Drexlerian molecular supercomputers and associated cell repair machines per cell. These concentrate on body management, dna checking (cosmic ray damage etc.) and command-driven regime change in the dna, as well as communication between cells. There are also speciality nanomachinery (such as miniature lasers) floating around between cells (you may weight a bit more, perhaps you have less water in your body). Your brain is augmented in the area between brain and skull with computronium filaments and materials, which also run through it. Of course, your body will be modified according to your particular whim regarding skeletal structure etc. etc.. However, generically speaking, each cell contains a set of storage material (akin to dna) that is not directly neural (since it is more vulnerable outside of your augmented skull) but contains libraries, records etc., perhaps with some back up copies arranged around the body. This gives you about maybe 25 trillion gigabytes (excluding platform software) (slower access of course) of storage outside your augmented brain per se, which itself contains about the neural power of 200 million fully traditional human beings. Your head contains some continuous broadcast technology in NEMS and MEMS form as back-up to your bush robot skin extension. This can appear like skin or clothing and is command-controlled from specialized interfaces on your body surface etc.. [As an aside, amongst your data storage should be &quot;utility assembler&quot; software, capable of allowing your bush robot &quot;skin&quot; to make such - a one-metre spherical device or similar thing - and from it to make a &quot;basic library&quot; of goods and copies of itself. Sort of a &quot;swiss army knife&quot; assembler tool.] Presumed lifespan? 3 billion-to-depends on cosmology.
