<em>&gt; True. I wasn't thinking complete as-is cross-posting. Say, for example, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wiki posts are sent to a mailing list (suitably auto-fake-quoting for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context), or put into a bulletin board under the same scheme. Replies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those may or may not go back into the Wiki, depending on how you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work things and whether the Wiki maintains its own comments sections for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each entry or not.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is there really is no sense of a &quot;wiki post&quot; -- well, a page
<br>
can be edited.  So, are you suggesting to send out the entire page's
<br>
contents every time someone edits it?  Even if the edit is just
<br>
correcting a typo in a single word?
<br>
<p>Eerg.  Ouch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Posting to a Wiki is still, topologically, a conversation. So I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're viable things for some sort of inclusion in the planned grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tranhumanist information exchange.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I see pages in a wiki as a snapshot or moment in time
<br>
representing the collective voiced consciousness of a group of
<br>
contributors.  By examining it at a specific point in time there is no
<br>
way to be certain of who contributed what, even given &quot;signatures&quot;
<br>
that suggest someone contributed something specific as someone else
<br>
could have edited it without subsequently signing it themselves.
<br>
<p>Ahh, wabi sabi meets communication -- isn't it wonderful.
