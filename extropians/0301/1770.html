Gary Miller asks:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Couldn't these be built in the desert where the land has limited use for 
<br>
anything else? 
<br>
Couldn't solar arrays be place between the wind mills to increase the energy 
<br>
output per acre? 
<br>
Even geothermal could be colocated in the same area. 
<br>
All these forms of energy generation could use much of the same 
<br>
infrastructure. 
<br>
Plants farther away on the power grid near plentiful water could generate the 
<br>
hydrogen. 
<br>
Also isn't the oxygen produced as a byproduct by the process also useful in 
<br>
other forms of energy production such as the incineration  of waste at high 
<br>
temperature? 
<br>
Colocation of multiple forms of power generation should reduce the cost of 
<br>
each! &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>The whole concept that you suggest, while having the advantage of synergy of 
<br>
land use, begs the question of economic viability. What might push a more, 
<br>
humble wind farm (non-hydrogenic) company, from emerging profitability; into 
<br>
greater expense to move in a geothermal well, or a photovoltaic array, is 
<br>
questionable. It might kill profits and eliminate the wind farm company. Even 
<br>
with clean energy, please do not forget that money is the mantra.
