I was reading Flying magazine yesterday, and because of the long lead
<br>
time in print publishing it was only now reporting on a study released
<br>
last summer.  I don't think it was mentioned here.  Some links:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ahealthyme.com/article/hscoutn/102470909">http://www.ahealthyme.com/article/hscoutn/102470909</a>

<br>
<p>The study, reported in the journal Neurology, involved giving a group
<br>
of pilots some training/testing in a flight simulator.  They were then
<br>
given either a placebo or the Alzheimers drug donepezil, which enhances
<br>
acetylcholine, for 30 days.  Then they were tested again on the flight sim
<br>
to see how much they had retained.  (They didn't fly for those 30 days.)
<br>
<p>These were not Alzheimer's patients, they were typical pilots with
<br>
an average age of 52, but the drug provided significant performance
<br>
enhancement.  The placebo group showed a decline in performance on the
<br>
tests, as might be expected after 30 days away.  The donepezil group,
<br>
however, performed at the same level as they had 30 days earlier.
<br>
They had retained all of the training benefits over that 30 day period
<br>
away from the cockpit.
<br>
<p>The authors of the paper point out that this result raises new ethical
<br>
questions.  Here is a case where normal, healthy people had their mental
<br>
performance enhanced by a drug.  If this result can be extended and proven
<br>
for the general population, would it imply that most people might want
<br>
to start taking this drug, at least as they get older?  More generally,
<br>
if there is a drug that makes people smarter, should everyone take it?
<br>
<p>Now, in practice things are not so clear cut.  The drug does have some
<br>
side effects.  And my wife, who works as a therapist with some Alzheimer's
<br>
patients, cautions that this drug (sold under the name Aricept) often
<br>
shows decreased effectiveness after a while.  This may be due to the
<br>
progressive nature of Alzheimer's, or it might be that the enhancement
<br>
of the cholinergic system becomes less effective as the brain adjusts
<br>
to its new chemistry.
<br>
<p>We still have something of a taboo about healthy people meddling
<br>
with their brain chemistry (beyond a few socially approved examples
<br>
like alcohol).  Peter Kramer's book Listening to Prozac, published ten
<br>
years ago, described a number of examples of people who were basically
<br>
healthy mentally who nevertheless got great benefits from Prozac; it made
<br>
them more confident, more successful.  But there is a stigma attached,
<br>
and few of us would ask a doctor to put them on Prozac for a few months
<br>
just to see if it made our lives better.
<br>
<p>Chances are this is going to change over the next few decades, as more
<br>
effective drugs are found, with fewer side effects.  In a way, it's good
<br>
that older people suffer mental deficits, as it provides a socially
<br>
acceptable justification for research into medications that enhance
<br>
mental performance.  As good drugs are found they may well leak down
<br>
into the healthier segments of the population.  Eventually the stigma
<br>
will hopefully break down and people will adopt a more Extropian attitude
<br>
towards enhancing their minds.
