<p>Yeah. Me too. BTW I think there is a lot that could be

usefully discussed in this thread, but to try and cover

it all in one post wound make things pretty unmanageable

so I hope you don't mind me taking it &quot;in shifts&quot; a bit.

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;[JG]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So we should be doers of the meme and not hearers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only? : )
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [BP] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, memes as I understand them are particular ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are able to be communicated, so we wouldn't actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *do* them so  much, as promote or propagate what we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  think are good ones.
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; [JG} 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Ahh..., but aren't those the particular ideas which motivate our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions?)
</em><br>
<p>I think this is an important point you've raised.  Memes 
<br>
*can* be *both* &quot;ideas&quot; that influence how people &quot;think&quot;
<br>
and therefore act, but also because we recognize them as 
<br>
potentially able to do this, we can set out to deliberately
<br>
promote some memes in favor of others.  
<br>
<p>Richard Dawkins coined the term &quot;meme&quot; in his book 'The 
<br>
Selfish Gene' back in 1976. The idea of  ideas replicating 
<br>
themselves in peoples minds and &quot;competing&quot; and &quot;cooperating&quot;
<br>
with each other to get themselves replicated and spread into 
<br>
other &quot;minds&quot; (in a manner similar to genes), was a popular one.
<br>
So popular that the meme of &quot;meme&quot; itself started to get talked 
<br>
about quite a lot. No one, to my knowledge, has bothered to
<br>
coin a term for a meta-meme as such. So the meme of &quot;memes&quot;,
<br>
is just another meme too. But it's a particularly powerful one. 
<br>
And I think we can make use of it, both generally, to understand
<br>
the political world better, and specifically, to be more politically
<br>
effective in the world.
<br>
<p>Its because the meme of &quot;memes&quot; is a meme itself, that we
<br>
can be *both* influenced by memes and deliberately set out
<br>
to propagate particular memes (such as the ExI principles
<br>
for instance) into our broader communities and societies. 
<br>
<p>Let me apologise in advance if I sometimes come across as 
<br>
patronising, it may well be that *you* know all this. But as
<br>
Robert Bradbury noted in a recent post, just the stuff on the 
<br>
ExI reading list is like a college education in volume in itself
<br>
and I'm trying to make sure that as many other readers who 
<br>
may be interested can understand as possible. In democracies,
<br>
its the numbers of votes that turns certain social policies into 
<br>
laws, and so I am keen to get as many people as possible 
<br>
actively and effectively pursuing policies consistent with the
<br>
ExI Principles. Also, if I put things down, as *I* understand
<br>
them, and I'm wrong, then *my* mistakes will stick out and
<br>
others can correct or challenge me on them. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; [BP]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My interest, (perhaps call?) to politics, or &quot;social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; politics&quot;, if you prefer is a call to relevant pragmatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action *in the world* to achieve our objects knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we will be confronted all along the way with the &quot;you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should not play God&quot; charge as though we actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have a choice on that matter.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; [JG] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I envision local extropian/transhumanist/cryonics groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering on a regular basis and getting involved in their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communities by a combination of mass media involvement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (if they have the talents and to an extent the credentials), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sponsoring lectures and seminars(on a very basic level), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when necessary going out and picketing &amp; raising a little hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to counter outspoken luddites who are usually the only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squeaky wheels around when news cameras are around.
</em><br>
<p>I think in the US your larger population may make it easier
<br>
to achieve the sort of critical mass than here in Australia. If you 
<br>
can get the local groups going that's great. 
<br>
<p>With the possible exception of &quot;picketing &amp; raising a little
<br>
hell&quot; I think a lot of the activities you mention above would 
<br>
raise awareness and help foster acceptance for extropic
<br>
memes such as radical life extension and others.
<br>
<p>My concern with picketing etc is that it may be not be seen as 
<br>
more than noise from small numbers. One for one, transhumanists 
<br>
probably can't shout any louder, talk any longer, or be any more
<br>
passionately in favor of causes than other folk. So we need
<br>
to be smarter in our lobbying. 
<br>
<p>A point that I think might often be overlooked is that we don't
<br>
actually *need* to persuade the luddites in democracies unless
<br>
the luddites become a majority. We only need to outperform 
<br>
the luddites in the political debates and public discourses so that 
<br>
the vast majority of &quot;undecideds&quot; who are listening often without
<br>
commenting can see the sense in supporting the particular 
<br>
extropic case rather than the luddite case. 
<br>
<p>In comparison with the luddites we do face a substantial 
<br>
disadvantage though. Because we are the ones wanting to make 
<br>
the changes, and the default position for the undecided folk is no
<br>
change. We actually have the burden of making the case. The 
<br>
luddites just have to avoid losing, we actually have to win. And
<br>
because the &quot;undecideds&quot; have a whole bunch of other stuff on
<br>
their minds that usually seems more real and urgent than stem
<br>
cells, GM foods, genetic engineering, cryonics and nanotechnology.
<br>
we have to first get their interest and then make our case.  
<br>
<p>This is a critical point in my view, politically the luddites don't
<br>
have to make their case. We do. The undecideds are not stupid
<br>
but they do have a lot of other things competing for their attention
<br>
many of which will seem more real, urgent and relevant to them. 
<br>
Little wonder most of the population most of the time is happy
<br>
to go along with conventional wisdom and popular beliefs. 
<br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; They would be at least nominally guided/advised by Max 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More, Natasha Vita-More, Greg Burch, Harvey Newstrom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other wise ExI officers/members who could help them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do well and not have things blow up in their face.) 
</em><br>
<p>I think it is important to protect the integrity of the Extropian 
<br>
brand to a certain extent so that intelligent capable folk don't
<br>
stop being willing to associate themselves with it. We do need
<br>
flags to rally around if we are going to marshal concerted efforts
<br>
and it is important that those flags or brands like ExI don't get to
<br>
&quot;tattered&quot;. 
<br>
<p>That said, the best insurance against an occasional botched 
<br>
communication or high profile &quot;bad egg&quot; is probably a lot of
<br>
good quality communications and high profile &quot;good eggs&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (VOLUNTEERING (I'm sure they could find worthy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects) to be seen as a force for good (and also actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BE a force for good) by the people around them would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also be a huge boon to us.  How about &quot;eductional toys for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tots&quot; sponsored by your cities local Extropian chapter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The possibilities could be endless here.)
</em><br>
<p>Each idea needs to be considered on its merits and considered
<br>
I suggest in terms of opportunity costs. People more naturally
<br>
budget money than time. We need to do both lest we run out
<br>
of time. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; [JG]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me we have had an elite of extropian leaders who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have the personalities, intellect, education, reputation, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; charm necessary  to get interviewed in the mass media, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engage in public debates and publish articles in widely read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or at least influential publications. 
</em><br>
. 
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [BP]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes there are lots of very capable people associated with ExI.
</em><br>
. 
<br>
<em>&gt; [JG]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's time to better harness them.
</em><br>
<p>I think you we're right about suspecting extropians will resist
<br>
harnessing : )  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [JG]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I remember when Mike Lorrey (perhaps to an extent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; motivated by frustration) tried to found his own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; organization to actually go out and do something in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; local community. But his idea of putting pro-GM food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labels on fruit may have been going too far.
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [BP]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, overcoming fears about GM foods is tough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but this is exactly the sort of issue that I think is important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for ExI to take on at some stage because it is the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sort of fear about biotechnology, largely coming from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lack or real understanding that is likely to pop up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again and again as extropians try and  encourage not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just the development of new life enhancing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies but the legal environment in which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be permitted to use them. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My own area of deepest  experience (not expertise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by any means) is probably more in the biotech area 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically in  stem cells. And what I have seen in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last couple of years or really ever since Dolly the clone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was reported back in November 1998 is a lot of political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obstacles to potentially life saving technologies going up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mainly due to ignorance and fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am concerned that, the  very democracies in which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we live, may veto the  things we wish to do because a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  majority of voters will fear the change and vote against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it. Its because of my experience as a stem cell lobbyist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and my concern that the political log jams may be so hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to push through in the timeframes we'd like that I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly interested in the practicalities of  forging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. Its in this sense of wanting to forge change that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am thinking politically. 
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt;[JG] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are very thought-provoking comments, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though nothing which is really new to me.  As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stem-cell lobbyist do you see broad and effective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalitions being formed to promote the wise use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the technology and counter opposition?  And if so is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it being funded and lead properly?)
</em><br>
<p>I think I'd better answer this question later in another
<br>
post or this thread will be unmanageably long : )
<br>
<p>I will come back to it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[JG] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One reason cryonics attracts me is that it's the ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety net should the war against aging not succeed fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough for me(or wind up setback for decades).  
</em><br>
<p>I'm not yet certain cryonics will work myself but the 
<br>
chances are better than burial or cremation. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;[BP]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think our ideas, and our ability to convey our ideas to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a wider community will be important. Of course its very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to convey ideas that suck, so the ideas really have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be good.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [JG]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Anders Sandberg, Max More, Eliezer Yudkowsky 
</em><br>
&nbsp;and others have eloquently discussed this matter in past
<br>
&nbsp;threads.)
<br>
<p>Yep I'm sure. I've probably seen some of the threads.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;[JG]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If among extropy listmembers we had the will to act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equal to the level of intellect here there would be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem. Of course one or two really wrong steps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the public eye could do possibly incalculable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; damage.  What will be done?    
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;[BP]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've proposed a simple beginning. I've proposed we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start by tidying up some of the language and terminology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we use so that our thoughts are clearer and so that when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we engage with people and groups who oppose our aims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can do so more effectively. 
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; [JG] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I feel fortunate to be in my own way trying to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something. In time the Creekside Preserve Lodge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where I work will branch out into the Ventureville
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cryonics community which will be a haven for both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; old and young cryonicists. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes. It must be good to work in an area that you feel so
<br>
passionately about. 
<br>
<p><em> &gt; [JG] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Perhaps sometime we will meet at an Extro or Alcor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conference if you are the traveling sort of Australian.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if that is so, you will have to stay at The Creekside Preserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lodge if you are ever in the area for whatever reason.)
</em><br>
<p>I do intend to be more of the travelling sort of Australian at
<br>
some point. : ) And the US is probably the country I'd most
<br>
like to see. I'll remember The Creekside Preserve Lodge.
