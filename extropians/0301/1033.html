<em>&gt; Do you believe there is anything like &quot;international law&quot; or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there should be?  Do you believe that might makes right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between nations or is there some set of standards, whether you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call it &quot;international law&quot; or not, on which the actions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations in regards to one another should be judged?
</em><br>
<p>I have found that pacifists who keep harping on the &quot;international law&quot;
<br>
phrase know shockingly little about international law, including
<br>
yourself, and those who I've encouraged to study up on the subject seem
<br>
to have stubbornly chosen to retain their ignorance, including
<br>
yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best reasons for not going to war are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) It will not make America any &quot;safer&quot; and could make the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international situation much more dangerous;
</em><br>
<p>It will make America immensely safer, because with a stable and
<br>
pluralistic, democratic Iraq, we will defuse the arguments of the
<br>
anti-US muslim radicals who claim we are against democratic governments
<br>
in muslim nations. With allies like Turkey, Afghanistan, and Iraq as
<br>
examples, muslim despots will find themselves increasingly isolated
<br>
even within their own countries.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, with a democratic Iraq, Iraqi oil will be freely sold on
<br>
the world markets, causing oil prices to plummet to $10/bbl ranges,
<br>
triggering budget deficits in muslim despot nations, forcing them to
<br>
cut their funding of terrorist groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) It will cost a large fortune when we are already economically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tanked;
</em><br>
<p>We are hardly economically tanked. Last year's economy grew at a 3.0
<br>
percent rate, hardly anemic. One thing that would help immeasurably
<br>
would be to rescind the TRA of 1998 so that telecom companies can make
<br>
a profit running fiber into US households.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) It will dirictly and indirectly result in the real deaths of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a guesstimated 100,000 - 1,000,000 people.
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit. Absolute hogwash. Deaths from the Gulf War were somewhere
<br>
between 40,000-100,000 and those were almost all combatants. Precision
<br>
guidance has improved immeasurably since then. We waged a much broader
<br>
campaign in Afghanistan than we did in GW I, yet on 5,000 deaths
<br>
occured.
<br>
<p>With a quasi-independent Kurd government in the north acting as a
<br>
northern base, much better than the Northern Alliance served in
<br>
Afghanistan, and acting as liasons between US forces and Iraqi military
<br>
units, I expect that we won't even need to destroy as much Iraqi
<br>
equipment as we did the first time to achieve even higher surrender
<br>
rates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Iraq, even if it had everything we cannot prove it has, would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be a serious enough threat to justify the above nor would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple &quot;regime change&quot; remove any such threat;
</em><br>
<p>A changed regime would be less likely to use any remaining WMD on their
<br>
own people, not to mention on others. If we assure that there is a
<br>
pluralistic government in place, and it looks like Khofi Annan is
<br>
organizing plans for such an occurence, they will likely willfully
<br>
dismantle their programs much as South Africa did.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) The American people do not want this war and it will tear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell out the already fragile respect for government and law (not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they deserve much) if this war goes forward;
</em><br>
<p>I see a majority in polls saying that it needs doing. I am quite sure
<br>
your chattering intelligentsia buddies don't like it, but their
<br>
opinions have never reflected those of the people.
