<br>
<p><p>IMMEDIATE ATTENTION NEEDED
<br>
: HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
<br>
<p><p>FROM: GEORGE WALKER BUSH
<br>
DEAR SIR / MADAM,
<br>
<p>I AM GEORGE WALKER BUSH, SON OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE
<br>
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH, AND
<br>
CURRENTLY SERVING AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF
<br>
AMERICA. THIS LETTER MIGHT SURPRISE YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT
<br>
MET NEITHER IN PERSON NOR BY CORRESPONDENCE. I CAME TO KNOW
<br>
OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO
<br>
HANDLE A VERY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION, WHICH
<br>
INVOLVES THE TRANSFER OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO AN ACCOUNT
<br>
REQUIRING MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE.
<br>
<p><p>I AM WRITING YOU IN ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE PRIMARILY TO SEEK
<br>
YOUR ASSISTANCE IN ACQUIRING OIL FUNDS THAT ARE PRESENTLY
<br>
TRAPPED IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ. MY PARTNERS AND I SOLICIT
<br>
YOUR ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING A TRANSACTION BEGUN BY MY
<br>
FATHER, WHO HAS LONG BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE EXTRACTION
<br>
OF PETROLEUM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND BRAVELY
<br>
SERVED HIS COUNTRY AS DIRECTOR OF THE UNITED STATES CENTRAL
<br>
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.
<br>
<p><p>IN THE DECADE OF THE NINETEEN-EIGHTIES, MY FATHER, THEN
<br>
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SOUGHT TO
<br>
WORK WITH THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
<br>
OF IRAQ TO REGAIN LOST OIL REVENUE SOURCES IN THE
<br>
NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. THIS UNSUCCESSFUL
<br>
VENTURE WAS SOON FOLLOWED BY A FALLING OUT WITH HIS IRAQI
<br>
PARTNER, WHO SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL OIL REVENUE
<br>
SOURCES IN THE NEIGHBORING EMIRATE OF KUWAIT, A WHOLLY-OWNED
<br>
U.S.-BRITISH SUBSIDIARY.
<br>
<p><p>MY FATHER RE-SECURED THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF KUWAIT IN 1991
<br>
AT A COST OF SIXTY-ONE BILLION U.S. DOLLARS
<br>
($61,000,000,000). OUT OF THAT COST, THIRTY-SIX BILLION
<br>
DOLLARS ($36,000,000,000) WERE SUPPLIED BY HIS PARTNERS IN
<br>
THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHER PERSIAN GULF
<br>
MONARCHIES, AND SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ($16,000,000,000) BY
<br>
GERMAN AND JAPANESE PARTNERS. BUT MY FATHER'S FORMER IRAQI
<br>
BUSINESS PARTNER REMAINED IN CONTROL OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ
<br>
AND ITS PETROLEUM RESERVES.
<br>
<p><p>MY FAMILY IS CALLING FOR YOUR URGENT ASSISTANCE IN FUNDING
<br>
THE REMOVAL OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF IRAQ AND
<br>
ACQUIRING THE PETROLEUM ASSETS OF HIS COUNTRY, AS
<br>
COMPENSATION FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVING HIM FROM POWER.
<br>
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR PARTNERS FROM 1991 ARE NOT WILLING TO
<br>
SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF THIS NEW VENTURE, WHICH IN ITS
<br>
UPCOMING PHASE MAY COST THE SUM OF 100 BILLION TO 200
<br>
BILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000,000 - $200,000,000,000), BOTH
<br>
IN THE INITIAL ACQUISITION AND IN LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT.
<br>
<p><p>WITHOUT THE FUNDS FROM OUR 1991 PARTNERS, WE WOULD NOT BE
<br>
ABLE TO ACQUIRE THE OIL REVENUE TRAPPED WITHIN IRAQ. THAT IS
<br>
WHY MY FAMILY AND OUR COLLEAGUES ARE URGENTLY SEEKING YOUR
<br>
GRACIOUS ASSISTANCE. OUR DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES IN THIS
<br>
BUSINESS TRANSACTION INCLUDE THE SITTING VICE-PRESIDENT OF
<br>
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RICHARD CHENEY, WHO IS AN
<br>
ORIGINAL PARTNER IN THE IRAQ VENTURE AND FORMER HEAD OF THE
<br>
HALLIBURTON OIL COMPANY, AND CONDOLEEZA RICE, WHOSE
<br>
PROFESSIONAL DEDICATION TO THE VENTURE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN
<br>
THE NAMING OF A CHEVRON OIL TANKER AFTER HER.
<br>
<p><p>I WOULD BESEECH YOU TO TRANSFER A SUM EQUALING TEN TO
<br>
TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT (10-25 %) OF YOUR YEARLY INCOME TO OUR
<br>
ACCOUNT TO AID IN THIS IMPORTANT VENTURE. THE INTERNAL
<br>
REVENUE SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL
<br>
FUNCTION AS OUR TRUSTED INTERMEDIARY. I PROPOSE THAT YOU
<br>
MAKE THIS TRANSFER BEFORE THE FIFTEENTH (15TH) OF THE MONTH
<br>
OF APRIL.
<br>
<p><p>I KNOW THAT A TRANSACTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WOULD MAKE
<br>
ANYONE APPREHENSIVE AND WORRIED. BUT I AM ASSURING YOU THAT
<br>
ALL WILL BE WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY. A BOLD STEP TAKEN
<br>
SHALL NOT BE REGRETTED, I ASSURE YOU. PLEASE DO BE INFORMED
<br>
THAT THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL. IF YOU DO NOT
<br>
WISH TO CO-OPERATE IN THIS TRANSACTION, PLEASE CONTACT OUR
<br>
INTERMEDIARY REPRESENTATIVES TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE MATTER.
<br>
<p><p>I PRAY THAT YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PLIGHT. MY FAMILY AND OUR
<br>
COLLEAGUES WILL BE FOREVER GRATEFUL. PLEASE REPLY IN STRICT
<br>
CONFIDENCE TO THE CONTACT NUMBERS BELOW.
<br>
<p><p>SINCERELY WITH WARM REGARDS,
<br>
<p><p>GEORGE WALKER BUSH
