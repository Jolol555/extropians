&lt;&lt;Theologically he uses this generalized Berkeleyan
<br>
point of view to depict God as the Observer of the universe. Here God
<br>
creates the universe as a whole (ex nihilo) and every event in time (creatio
<br>
continua). The quantum nonseparability of the universe is suggestive of the
<br>
New Testamentâ€™s view of the unity of creation. In the process Chiao
<br>
discusses such ideas as the quantum entanglement of all events in the
<br>
universe given their common origin in the Big Bang, and he responds to the
<br>
challenge of the quantum Zeno paradox. &gt;
<br>
<p>Yes your article was from CTNS's group, (and da' Vatican) which is rather 
<br>
uninspiring, compared to my apparent contracting Tip-a-lis. A dread disease 
<br>
that causes a cynical joik-off like myself, to axiomatically, find a bit o' 
<br>
comfort, in crazy Frank Tipler's ravings (which I still suspect are true).

<br>
<p>Master Broderick, we usually turn our heads to the Left, when the Doctor asks 
<br>
us do *that*  But then I never turn my head to the Left for anything!  Yuck 
<br>
Yuck! And they say the intellectual quality of the list has declined because 
<br>
of me. The nerve, or 
<br>
noi-ve!
