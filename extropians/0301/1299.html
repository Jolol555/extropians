Greg has, in his usual style, said little and spoken volumes.
<br>
<p>(Side note to Greg -- not that I'm in any doubt that you
<br>
could not speak more but I'm relatively certain that you
<br>
have developed an ability to &quot;cut to the chase&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea is that the Cold War, with its objectives fixed over a half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century,  allowed U.S. forces to evolve into heavy, lumbering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overly-complex monstrosities whose clumsiness place an extreme limit on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy options.
</em><br>
<p>I do not think that U.S. forces currently have quite the inertia that
<br>
this statement would suggest.
<br>
<p>Instead I would suggest that the U.S. is still adapting to the lessons
<br>
of the Vietnam War.   If one engages with a &quot;matched&quot; force one is
<br>
likely to suffer losses.  If one engages with an overwhelming force
<br>
then it isn't a conversation worth engaging in.  The U.S. (with a
<br>
population of 280+ million people) vs. Iraq (with 24 million people)
<br>
isn't even a serious contest.  One wonders how the general population
<br>
of Iraq can even begin to believe there is some hope for success.
<br>
Any rational person would be attempting to find a path for negotiation.
<br>
The difference between strategy of the Vietnam War and the Gulf War
<br>
seems to suggest we (the U.S.) understand this distinction and are
<br>
unlikely to make the mistake (of using insufficient forces) again in the
<br>
nearest future.
<br>
<p>Not that I think this is a good idea of how to resolve differences
<br>
in the long run (one can only speculate about the power/population of
<br>
India &amp; China and what might happen when they start to throw their
<br>
weight around) or how one engages with a power that may have nuclear
<br>
weapons (e.g. North Korea).  But for the current situation of the U.S.
<br>
vs. almost any North African or Middle Eastern country it is a reasonable
<br>
perspective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The pace and texture of a similar conflict will look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very different in ten years: A U.S. president will have more options and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be able to be both strong and flexible, something that isn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible now.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this to a certain extent.  It seems likely to me that
<br>
the option will be &quot;off Saddam&quot; or &quot;move a few hundred thousand troops
<br>
into battleground preparation areas&quot;.  It doesn't take rocket science
<br>
to know which is cheaper and once this happens once or twice one isn't
<br>
going to find a lot of generals willing step into the positions formerly
<br>
occupied by individuals like Saddam.  A &quot;transparent&quot; society eliminates
<br>
dictators and their power base unless they have offsetting technology.
<br>
(With Iraq vs. the U.S. this isn't even a question worth discussing).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, one can see the foreign policy contrast between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Clinton and Bush II years as being characterized as two different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices in a binary dilemma: strong OR flexible.
</em><br>
<p>The point would be that in ten years it isn't necessary to be &quot;strong&quot;
<br>
*or* &quot;flexible&quot;.  If a leader misbehaves simply get rid of them.
<br>
It *is* so much more extropic than going to war.
<br>
<p>Greg's post was, as always, insightful.  I think, however, he may need
<br>
to expand his framework beyond a simple militaristic analysis.
<br>
<p>:-)
