Damien
<br>
<em>&gt; That's one of the points I remain unclear about. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I was under the impression that experiments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (either real or gedanken) by Chiao and colleagues 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had shown that even *in principle* slit closure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was enough to block interference. 
</em><br>
<p>The impression is correct. And I over-simplified, 
<br>
in a previous post. I was inaccurate.
<br>
<p>The 'complementarity principle', in a very good formulation 
<br>
(by Von Weizsaecker, 1955), states that 'localization'
<br>
(of a quantum object) and 'superposition' are 'complementary'.
<br>
<p>By 'localization' Von W. meant spatial localization, or
<br>
temporal localization (as time arrival, there is no
<br>
quantum time), or, in general, any sharp or
<br>
semi-sharp determination of the value of any other 
<br>
quantum observable. (Hence we can have many kinds
<br>
of interference, and the time arrivals interference
<br>
is, at least, as interesting as the spatial interference). 
<br>
<p>The first question: is complementarity 'smooth'
<br>
or 'hard'? That is to say: does the interference
<br>
pattern change 'continuously' or not, when we try
<br>
to 'localize' an observable? This is an interesting
<br>
subject because many important authors (Wootters, 
<br>
Zurek, Greenberger, Yasin, Englert, Ghose, Mittelstaedt, 
<br>
and, in his 'informational' way, perhaps also Zeilinger, 
<br>
etc.) suggested an *ontological* interpretation.
<br>
<p>The *ontological* interpretation states that the wave-like
<br>
and the particle-like behaviour of a (single) particle,
<br>
are just the *extreme* forms of the *same* ontological
<br>
entity, the *particle-wave*.
<br>
<p>Note that the *ontological* interpretation does not
<br>
agree with Feynman's philosophy. 
<br>
'I want to emphasize that light comes in this 
<br>
form - particles. It is very important to know that 
<br>
light behaves like particles, especially for those 
<br>
of you who have gone to school, where you were probably 
<br>
told something about light behaving like waves. 
<br>
I'm telling you the way it does behave - like particles.'
<br>
wrote Richard Feynman in 'QED' (1986, p.15).
<br>
<p>Note that the *ontological* interpretation does not
<br>
agree with Bohr's philosophy, which says that complementarity
<br>
is a yes-no alternative, or an exclusive experimental 
<br>
disjunction of 'both' aspects.
<br>
<p>It is not easy, imo, to combine this *ontological* 
<br>
interpretation (and any other realistic interpretation,
<br>
like the old one which says that a real 'wave' exists,
<br>
but does not carry energy or momentum) with the MWI.  
<br>
<p>[part II coming, as soon as possible]
