</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you cite
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree. And I feel like a newbie again swimming in data.
<br>
<p>I read the post in the subject header for the first time this
<br>
morning and liked it because I thought it was provocative
<br>
and mistakenly thought it was new. The misreference to Daisy
<br>
the clone had me perplexed though, I didn't recall any Daisy,
<br>
and I've followed that area reasonably closely, and read Wilmut
<br>
et als book &quot;The Second Creation&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anyway, having gotten all excited about the possibility of some
<br>
genuinely thorough and constructive analysis I find the material
<br>
been gone over and therefore probably some of the fiercer minds 
<br>
will be reluctant to take it up again. What a bummer!
<br>
<p>I just read the link Greg refers to (above top), not forensically, but
<br>
close enough I think. I have to say, or rather choose to say, (as
<br>
a relative newbie to both transhumanism and Extropian thought)
<br>
it is *still* my suspicion that there is much in Toth-Fejel's criticisms
<br>
that could be &quot;valuably&quot; considered. That's a vague statement I
<br>
know but I'm wrestling now in part with the bandwidth of the
<br>
medium. .
<br>
<p>Unlike Greg Burch, I saw Toth-Fejels comments on first impression
<br>
as constructive and coming from an independent thinker and ally
<br>
not an opponent. I thought, &quot;Great! There's nothing like criticism to
<br>
make a good thing better.&quot; 
<br>
<p>For the record Greg, (having now read your Dialogue Concerning
<br>
Transhumanist and Extropian Ethics) I'm with you on the theist/atheist
<br>
dimension (unless you've changed your mind) but I don't think any, 
<br>
correction all, of Toth-Fejels points, or anyone else's, when they are
<br>
so well put together, can be summarily dismissed.
<br>
<p>I read you paper &quot;Extropian Ethics and the Extrosattva&quot; a couple of
<br>
months ago and thought it was very good. I didn't think your 
<br>
initial response to Toth-Fejel was of the same high standard. 
<br>
<p>Partly so you know I've read the paper, but mainly because it is an
<br>
unusual viewpoint and one I'm inclined to myself, I draw your 
<br>
attention to a statement you made (its page 45 of 52 on my printout.
<br>
Within Dialog part 1):
<br>
<p>You said (then):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;(Unlike many transhumanists) I think an &quot;objective&quot; morality is 
<br>
possible, and thus that moral axioms are not &quot;unprovable&quot; in the 
<br>
sense that they are not derived from empirical observation and
<br>
experiment&quot;.
<br>
<p>Does Extropian Ethics and the Extrosattva represent your most
<br>
developed thoughts or public thoughts on this subject?  I ask
<br>
because I want to know where the frontiers lie in your view and
<br>
because I want to gauge whether new efforts in this area should 
<br>
be a priority. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
