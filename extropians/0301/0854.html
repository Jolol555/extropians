<p>
This is a somewhat radical proposal for accelerating the singularity,
<br>
but I've not heard it discussed before, so here goes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Now that human cloning is pretty much a given.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I recommend obtaining DNA from the highest IQ people in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Then solicit scientists as volunteers to each adopt one of these clones
<br>
and agree to raise them as their own.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The scientists would be relocated to a single location.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The cloned children  would be raised in optimal environments given
<br>
access to books, computers and accelerated learning programs.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
They would be given to opportunity to pursue whatever intellectual
<br>
pursuits interested them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Payback should start to materialize by the time they are 20 and continue
<br>
until late in life.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Assuming we started with 50 clones, I feel this could accelerate the
<br>
singularity significantly.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
For those of you who feel we will have an AGI who will surpass all 50 of
<br>
these clones in the next 20 years, I hope you are right.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But I fear that while we will make significant advances in AI in this
<br>
period, the prize may still elude us.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Unfortunately we need the technological breakthroughs to provide energy,
<br>
food, and help us get off the planet before we destroy ourselves.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The clones would help provide technological boost to us as a nation in
<br>
an era where we will face critical problems!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The cloned children will be loved and raised as normal children and
<br>
perhaps generate the breakthrough which will be key to our survival.
