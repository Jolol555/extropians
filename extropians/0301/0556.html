<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Seems &quot;the world&quot; is still awaiting proof on two propositions :
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Notable, in the Clonaid case, is that around 11 days have passed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;since the birth of the alleged clone and no proof has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, if the Church of Government were intent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inquisitioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you for acting on such science (as was done 500 years ago in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; science that challenged the powers that be), you'd be circumspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offering up proof of your guilt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That seems very unlikely.  If they were worried about that then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they wouldn't have claimed bragging rights to start with.  No, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they made a public splash and in order to derive benefits from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it (such as new drones/members) they have to offer up evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was more than a misguided lie/publicity stunt.  The latter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would lose potential converts and perhaps even existing members.
</em><br>
<p>Clonaid are not the clones parents, and it is the parents who are under
<br>
legal attack in the courts right now. Their only defense at the moment
<br>
is secrecy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ditto on rules of evidence as above. There is in fact evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concealment in that significant quantities of chemical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotoxins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; known to be in inventory in 1998 are not accounted for in Iraq's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recent Declaration to the Security Council. They have disappeared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the tally, and Iraq refuses to disclose what happened to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where precisely did you get this information?
</em><br>
<p>Where millions of other informed citizens get it: cable news, the
<br>
newspapers, and the internet. Hans Blix stated these facts before the
<br>
Security Council (as did the US administration) after Iraq released its
<br>
Declaration to the UNSCOM.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;It seems that a whole lot of people are getting dressed up who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;going to be very disappointed to have no place to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you think they are not going anywhere, you are mistaken.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope to hell they aren't going anywhere like where they think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are.  Any sane person would.
</em><br>
<p>It isn't sane to wish to leave WMD in the hands of a madman any more
<br>
than it is sane to let a terrorist engage in negotiations for the
<br>
release of their hostages. You don't negotiate with terrorists, and you
<br>
don't tolerate the tyranny of a madman. Anyone who does is a fool and a coward.
