<p>
<em>&gt;In 1900, Argentina was the 6th wealthiest country in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What happened?
</em><br>
<p>Practically every single thing that could go wrong or done badly,
<br>
did and was so starting from the 1920s or around, I guess.
<br>
<p>My personal, and probably not completely objective opinion
<br>
(which I'm afraid I will not argue about due to lack of time
<br>
at the moment, and for the rest of the week): as the country
<br>
modernized, the power naturally tended to diffuse downwards
<br>
from the aristocratic classes that ruled since independence.
<br>
What the country failed miserably at was in properly integrating
<br>
the new power actors each time they appeared. In this, both
<br>
the previous dominant actors and the newly arrived at that
<br>
moment, are equally guilty. Everybody showed a remarkable
<br>
ability to carry on their power contests disregarding laws,
<br>
republican institutions, idea debate, and economic competition.
<br>
The way things have been solved since then has been by
<br>
coups, dictatorships, fraud, forced economic redistribution
<br>
(up to down, down to up, sideways, you name it), censorship,
<br>
and the gleeful application of violence in all its lovely ways.
<br>
And so here we are today, and still managing to get worse by
<br>
the week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does anyone know of a book that chronicles all the bad moves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made by that nation?
</em><br>
<p>I think this one was pretty good, though admittedly it's been
<br>
many years since I read it:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0271021926/">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0271021926/</a>
<br>
<p>As an Argentine myself, I tend to read more essays, opinion
<br>
pieces and news analysis than books that try to make sense of
<br>
the utter mess our history has been. The Economist has been
<br>
known, IMHO, to get regular articles on the past years about
<br>
our country, and usually pretty good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The latest mistake was apparently taking the peso off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dollar, which instantly cheated thousands of deep pockets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out of 3/4 their wealth.  And, more importantly, sent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;message that capital that wished to survive had better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flee the country.
</em><br>
<p>Not quite so. The mistake wasn't actually in doing that,
<br>
but in how and when. Once more, the people who ended up in
<br>
charge of things after the shit hit the fan didn't address
<br>
any of the problems, but proceeded to another of our
<br>
lovely forced economic redistributions to keep things tied
<br>
up just enough for the country not to blow up. I recommend
<br>
you this paper, which addresses several myths, such as the &quot;the
<br>
chaos was caused only by removing the peso currency peg&quot;:

<p><em>&gt;I heard also that the government had agreed to pick up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the bill for any cosmetic surgery desired by a citizen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is starting to sound like a case where the usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damage inflicted on an economy by socialist tendencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turned out to be too much, and killed it off.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words, the government spent itself to death.  And had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to start printing pesos?
</em><br>
<p>The Menem administration wasted all the money and structural
<br>
changes they managed to achieve during their first years when
<br>
they decided to go for reelection. The welfare spending that
<br>
ensued to catch the lower classes' vote, plus the cozy
<br>
kleptocracy/oligarchy dealings showered on many higher classes'
<br>
power actors to ensure their support did away both with the
<br>
money and with the structural changes. What resulted was
<br>
a bloated, perverted version of a welfare state administered
<br>
by political bosses that ensured the votes for the government
<br>
and the sweet deals for the government's bussinessmen friends.
<br>
The De La Rua administration completely failed to change
<br>
things and was devoured by the lower classes that now lacked
<br>
their easy welfare, and those of the upper classes that now
<br>
lacked their sweet deals and extended kleptocracy. The Duhalde
<br>
administration, as I mentioned before, did a huge redistribution
<br>
to make sure the boat wouldn't catch fire before sinking, and
<br>
then just sat on their asses yelling for the IMF to come stop
<br>
the sinking, all the while seeing how -their- particular
<br>
bussiness friends, political bosses and segments of the lower
<br>
classes could be put in charge of things after the rescue. It is
<br>
to be seen, this week if I recall right (last chance to a final
<br>
default being averted with their specific loans), if the IMF
<br>
will bite. Bunch of morons as they are, looks like they might...
<br>
<p>(I'll try to address any comments next week when I'm back, but no
<br>
promises... Sorry! Blame work and all that.)
<br>
<p>Carlos
