<p>
This was a TV show that appeared as if it may have been produced by the team 
<br>
that made Walking With Dinosaurs and Walking With Prehistoric Beasts. The 
<br>
show was the product of a series of consultants, all scientists, who predict, 
<br>
through geological impact, and biotic response, what life and geography on 
<br>
Earth will look like 5 million, 100 million, and 200 million years from now.  
<br>
The show appeared on Animal Planet on Jan 1st at 8pm, and undoubtedly, will 
<br>
be rebroadcast. Its worth a watch even thought it only lightly touches on 
<br>
transhumanist aspirations.
<br>
<p>Humans magically remove themselves from the scene, due to an impending 
<br>
diaster (this is never depicted). However, the narrator makes it clear that 
<br>
humanity has removed itself to another part of the galaxy. An automated 
<br>
probe, appears 5 million, 100 million, and 200 million years in the future. 
<br>
Each new probe, literally linking with the previous one. The probe is the 
<br>
gimmick or mcguffin, that makes the show function, as it spies on the last 
<br>
species of primates, upheavals in geology, and when a new species of fish, 
<br>
takes to the air; to replace that biome, once exclusive to birds, bats, and 
<br>
bugs. Please check this website for more info.
