<p>The meme they were competing with was the Divine Right of Kings.
<br>
So it wasn't just a psychological necessity for them--it was a
<br>
memetic necessity for mindshare. Where does the DRoK originate?
<br>
<p>I'd put it back at least as far as &quot;In Hoc Signo Vincit&quot;--Constantine's
<br>
claimed vision-leading-to-conversion in which he saw a blazing cross
<br>
in the sky and was told by the Christian God to whup the heathen butt.
<br>
I'm not sure if he saw the words in Latin or the Greek equivalent, or
<br>
if he made the whole thing up as great PR.
<br>
<p>I kind of think the whole (monotheistic-) God &amp; country thing has all
<br>
been downhill from the time Constantine started doing his thing. Kill
<br>
for Christ. Now there's a meme that has worked overtime.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>PS: I seem to have been using a lot of Latin lately.
<br>
The above means &quot;In this sign I conquer&quot;.
<br>
He had all his men-in-arms paint it on their vestments and shields.
<br>
I'm told they made a lasting impression.
