<p>
Seems &quot;the world&quot; is still awaiting proof on two propositions 
<br>
both of which have commanded worldwide media attention and 
<br>
both of which seem to be increasingly doubtful. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps it is still too soon in both cases to conclude that
<br>
because no proof has been provided so far that no proof
<br>
with be provided. 
<br>
<p>Notable, in the Clonaid case, is that around 11 days have passed
<br>
since the birth of the alleged clone and no proof has been presented.
<br>
Rael has been in the media making clear Clonaid and the Raelians
<br>
are two separate organisations, and the independent journalist Michael
<br>
Guillen who's task it was to arrange for scientists to do DNA testing 
<br>
is being reported as having &quot;suspended his efforts&quot; to &quot;verify claims&quot; and
<br>
&quot;that it is still entirely possible Clonaid's announcement is part of an 
<br>
elaborate hoax intended to bring publicity to the Raelian movement&quot;. 
<br>
<p>In fairness to Clonaid, it does seem that there are some legitimate
<br>
difficulties in getting a test done in the US, with several US agencies
<br>
looking to find the mother and possibly take legal action to protect the
<br>
baby. 
<br>
<p>Still, there is allegedly another clone, now in Europe, and it should
<br>
not take long to get a DNA test done there. The clock is ticking. 
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Meanwhile despite having 25,000 US troops in the Gulf and another
<br>
75,000 on the way, despite Britain and now apparently France preparing
<br>
to send troops as well, the weapons inspectors have still not found
<br>
any evidence of WMD, no evidence (at least that I have heard of) 
<br>
has been presented linking Hussein to terrorist acts since the last Gulf
<br>
war.
<br>
<p>It seems that a whole lot of people are getting dressed up who are
<br>
going to be very disappointed to have no place to go.
<br>
<p>Seriously, if the weapons inspection team find no evidence of 
<br>
weapons of mass destruction and no evidence is presented linking
<br>
Hussein's regime with recent terrorist activities, can there be a 
<br>
justification for invading a sovereign country? I don't doubt it will
<br>
happen but is it justified?
<br>
<p>Yet can anyone conceive of *any* means by which George Bush
<br>
could *not* remove Hussein now (given the givens, the rhetoric,
<br>
the build up of troops and expectations, AND the US economic
<br>
difficulties) AND still manage to win a second term as President?
<br>
Seems to me Bush now must go to war or look weak and be
<br>
booted out of office (his current popularity not withstanding).  
<br>
Seems to me that Bush's power really only cuts one way at this
<br>
point. Its hard to see how he could pull back regardless of whether
<br>
this particular war turns out to be justified or not and not loss the
<br>
next Presidential election taking the Republican's down with him.
<br>
<p>I wonder whether evidence will be provided to the public before
<br>
(or even after the invasion) or how flimsy the pretext (assuming no
<br>
WMD are found) will actually be able to be before public opinion
<br>
would turn against an invasion aimed at removing a sovereign head
<br>
of state. Without Iraq getting rolled (and the war on terror) the
<br>
biggest issue would become the economy and Bush would have 
<br>
spent heaps of money on a troop build-up that didn't do anything.
<br>
<p>I may be overlooking evidence that has been presented, there may
<br>
be evidence that is being sat on until the troops are in place. Perhaps
<br>
their will be one final summation sent out via the media as a last
<br>
minute PR flourish. But if neither of these are true it will be an 
<br>
interesting case study in global gullibility to see how flimsy the pretext
<br>
can be. How far, I wonder, will the Bush Administration along with
<br>
Blair and Australia PM John Howard be prepared or bother to go 
<br>
*if* they have no &quot;smoking gun&quot; to give their respective citizens even
<br>
the illusion &quot;that justice is being done&quot;. How much would the principle
<br>
of not invading a sovereign country and not launching a pre-emptive 
<br>
strike (read aggressive strike if its not justified) be worth in the 
<br>
private offices of these decision makers. Would polls or principles
<br>
predominate in their deliberations?R. 
<br>
<p>For the record I still have an open mind on Hussein being shown
<br>
to have weapons of mass destruction or to have significantly lied
<br>
about a weapons program recently. But I don't like to see even 
<br>
a felon and career villain hung for a crime he didn't commit. The
<br>
specific case still needs to be made if justice is to be seen to be
<br>
done. Its dangerous to the US that injustice rather than justice
<br>
gets seen to be done.
