<p>&quot;That's a false dichotomy. One can be against dictatorship, and still not
<br>
see war as a good way to handle the situation.  Those over-semplifications
<br>
are merely a propaganda tool. The &quot;either with us, or against us&quot; expression
<br>
was used by both Bush and Bin Laden shortly
<br>
after 9/11. And it's clear that the world is more complicated than that.&quot;
<br>
<p>Good point, indeed it was and I did not realize it as I typed it.  One can
<br>
certainly support other methods of removing murderous tyrannical dictators
<br>
from power without an all out war, unfortunately we have already tried the
<br>
vast majority of those with IRAQ.  I suppose we could just sit around and
<br>
wait for Saddam to get old and die, as is apparently our strategy with cuba,
<br>
but I don't think the Kurds, the Isrealis, or even the general populace of
<br>
IRAQ much prefer to live under the rule of Saddam, despite his amazing
<br>
recent 99% approval vote.
<br>
<p>But it is just as much of a fallacy to continually present war as always
<br>
immoral and diplomatic solutions as always moral.  The world, as you say, is
<br>
more complicated than that.  What 'diplomatic' efforts would you suggest be
<br>
persued?  Keep in mind the arguments from the right that during these
<br>
diplomatic persuits, Saddam is still a murderous dictatorial tyrant, racist,
<br>
west freedom and America hating, supportive of terrorism, has and is
<br>
attempting to get more weapons of mass distruction, and to top that off
<br>
controls, as a corrupt oppresive murderous dictator, one of the worlds
<br>
largest and cheapest abundant energy supplies.  Energy which would be used
<br>
for, surprisingly, corruption, oppresion, tyranny and murder.  
<br>
