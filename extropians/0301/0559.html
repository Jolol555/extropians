<em>&gt;&gt;That's OK, most of the fools out there accessorizing their cars with carbon fiber
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;'cause it looks baaad have no clue how it behaves in a crash, let alone a car fire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Graphite/epoxy doesn't do too badly on impact, if designed for impacts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Formula 1). It doesn't burn very well, and by the time it ignites you're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burned already to cinders by the hydrocarbon conflagration which managed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ignite the graphite honeycomb chassis.
</em><br>
<p>You're talking about team-maintained race cars. I'm talking about &quot;trick&quot; cars (out here,
<br>
a lot of them are either Hondas or lowriders) &quot;accesssorized&quot; (I used the word right there)--
<br>
with carbon fiber applique slapped on by bozos, for example on hoods (&quot;bonnets&quot;) and other
<br>
parts of the exterior, and interior locations such as dashboard and front door kick panels.
<br>
<p>Such thin layers splinter in compression, and can ignite easily if, for example, you have
<br>
a fuel leak in your tricky engine compartment with the purple fluorescent accent lights
<br>
running while you are cruising or competing to see how high you can make the hydraulics
<br>
bounce it.
<br>
<p>As I said, most of those fools have no clue. Evolution in action...
