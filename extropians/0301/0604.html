<p>Anyone who doesn't agree to invade a sovereign country that may

(although we can't prove it yet) have a few containers of nerve

gas on hand, and thus probably embroil an entire region, kill

tens, possibly hundreds of thousands and cost us hundreds of 
<br>
billions of dollars minimum is a coward?  You have a pretty 
<br>
screwy value system
<br>
<p>Whoever would attack on the current mostly lack of grounds is an 
<br>
irresponsible beligerent. A country that proposes to do so is 
<br>
acting in a rogue manner.
<br>
<p>The tyranny of this particular madman is one that we supported 
<br>
for a lot of years as long as Saddam was going after those we 
<br>
wished him to. To imply we are lily white and are ridding the 
<br>
world of a dangerous lunatic or that he has any really worrisome 
<br>
power capable of being a real threat to us is more than a little 
<br>
disingenuous.
