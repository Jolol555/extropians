<em>&gt; Damien,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Yes, it is a muggs game.  Those that wish to go to war can never win 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that argument with the peaceniks.  They think we are so much more noble when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we stand passively and die magnificently.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think we are more noble as Americans when we take our heritage 
<br>
seriously enough to avoid entanglements all over the globe 
<br>
engaged in for highly questionable reasons and at very high 
<br>
costs at all levels.  We have no business as a free people going 
<br>
to war except in very clear circumstances.  Iraq is NOT such at 
<br>
this time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        But we will go anyway.  We know that the right to assemble was not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delivered to us by those planning peace protests and trying to trip our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts.  It was delivered to us by our forefathers fighting and dying.
</em><br>
<p>The right to protest is PRECISELY what the effort to start this 
<br>
country was about and for.  I was at the SF march and rally.  I 
<br>
cannot say enough about how much good it did me to see hundreds 
<br>
of thousands of regular people, people of all descriptions, turn 
<br>
out and participate at this time.  I thought everyone was too 
<br>
apathetic.  For each one of them here and the many hundreds of 
<br>
thousands elsewhere in the US who showed up I would bet there 
<br>
are 10 times as many who stayed home but are basically against 
<br>
this atrocious and useless escapade.  The people are not behind 
<br>
this.  They people will prevail sooner or later.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Emancipation was not delivered by cousin Abe with his Emancipation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Proclamation but by my great great uncle (and thousands of others) lying dead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the military graveyard in Nashville, Tennessee (and other places).
</em><br>
<p>So all you understand and consider honorable is war, might, 
<br>
death and destruction?  If so, then I pity you.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;        The peaceniks can do as they please.  Let them get organized.  Let 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them spit when the boys come home.  We will do what has to be done.
</em><br>
<p>What is this &quot;we&quot;?  You will sit this one out due to age and 
<br>
cheer other &quot;boys&quot; on to their death in a more senseless 
<br>
conflict than even Vietnam was.  Bully for you.
