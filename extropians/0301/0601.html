<p>
I think it is wrong to equate IQ or any intelligence with quality of 
<br>
life.  When I was a janitor I worked with a guy that was a huge moron.  He 
<br>
knew that he had trouble with reading and numbers and was not ashamed to 
<br>
ask for help with any reading or with numbers.  He worked hard and never 
<br>
avoided any jobs.  He was married to a pleasant lady that knew he was 
<br>
limited but she also knew that he loved her.  He had two kids, one of whom 
<br>
got an MBA at UCLA.  He lived in a modest house and drove an old rusty 
<br>
car.  He didn't always get our jokes and didn't understand why some movies 
<br>
were popular.  I think that he could see things in a soccer game that no 
<br>
one else saw.  Even though he was a huge moron I will always admire that 
<br>
guy.  I think he had a great quality of life and sometimes I wish that I 
<br>
could see the beauty in life that he saw.
