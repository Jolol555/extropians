<p>Would you have a baby if you knew she would be morbidly obese, have

hypertrophied organs, possibly other defects and a shortened life span

because of something you did deliberately, and caused the genome activity
<br>
got reset improperly? A poster on wta-talk said yesterday he would go
<br>
ahead with making a human version of Doogie mice. He thought higher
<br>
chronical pain sensitivity would be a tolerable tradeoff to the
<br>
(undemonstrated in people) somewhat higher smarts. What?
<br>
<p>I frankly fail to see any palpable gains here, only risks. If it is to be
<br>
done the effects of an insert needs to be tested on chimps, including
<br>
developing a technique for embryo screening with improper inserts,
<br>
knocking out a gene or two.
