<p>Hmm? Have you studied the history of prohibition? While reduced
<br>
productivity was one of the arguments in the early decades, it has 
<br>
largely disappeared since it is basically a fascist argument based 
<br>
on the idea that people are intended to serve society and not the 
<br>
other way around. The real core of the prohibition movement was the 
<br>
alliance between health movements (based on romantic notions of 
<br>
naturalness and shady pseudoscience) and religious movements.
<br>
<p>In fact, in Sweden the idea that drugs could enhance productivity
<br>
is used as support for the current strong anti-drug policy - if
<br>
those drugs become legal the evil corporations will make their
<br>
employees take them, or people will have to take them to compete
<br>
with each other. Hence they should be banned. Of course, that line
<br>
of reasoning never seem to dwell upon the problem of Sweden lagging
<br>
further and further behind in productivity today, and that these
<br>
drugs might become legal in other countries. I guess the official
<br>
position in that case would be that Sweden can teach every other
<br>
nation to follow our obviously workable and realistic drug
<br>
policies...
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note the current case of the US Air Force 
<br>
defending the use of amphetamines for performance enhancement:
<br>
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=571&amp;ncid=751&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20030116/hl_nm/amphetamines_pilots_dc">http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=571&amp;ncid=751&amp;e=1&amp;u=/nm/20030116/hl_nm/amphetamines_pilots_dc</a><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;On Thursday, the Air Force Surgeon General's office sent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pilot physician Pete Demitry to Barksdale to tell reporters
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covering the hearing that Dexedrine is a good thing, not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bad. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told a news conference the Air Force has used the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stimulant safely for 60 years and that it is better than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coffee because it not only keeps users awake, but also 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increases alertness. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There had been no known speed-related mishaps in the Air
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Force, whereas there had been many fatigue-related
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accidents, Demitry said. &quot;
<br>
<p>Note that this is a drug that is highly illegal when used for 
<br>
private civilian performance enhancement, and doctors are to my 
<br>
knowledge not allowed to prescribe it as a performance enhancer 
<br>
despite the above claims of safety and efficacy. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's rather devices than drugs that'll bring the real progress (e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct brain&lt;-&gt;machine interfaces). Problems could arise when a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of users use them as a replacement for recreational drugs (such as 24/7
</em><br>
<em>&gt; VR sex), forgetting the real world around them. That's clearly bad for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productivity and govt will thus seek ways to prevent such (ab)use.
</em><br>
<p>Useful neural interfaces are at least a decade away. But the 
<br>
discoveries in neuroscience and limited neurointerfaces are still 
<br>
significant, and not just as &quot;drugs&quot; - brain fingerprinting, 
<br>
methods of modulating activity affecting mood, attention and 
<br>
memory, even the deeper understanding of how we make voluntary 
<br>
actions and motivate ourselves - all these have important and 
<br>
drastic consequences. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The legal question of identity is quite simple as long as uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't possible: It'll be handled as now. Society is not going to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if one can drop all responsibility when enhancing oneself. The same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question arises with all criminals who's crime is many years ago, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance WWII crimes. My impression is that society answered this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question clearly: Yes, this 85 year old person is the same as the 31
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year old guy who committed the crimes. A person is the same 50 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later if this person is linked by a continued existence.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but that is going to run into a few cases where people have
<br>
undergone profound personality or cognitive changes. Am I guilty of
<br>
a murder if I can show that my frontal lobes were not working
<br>
correctly at the time? Most likely it would be temporary insanity
<br>
instead. But what if I had deliberately caused that change in my
<br>
frontal lobes? What if I decide to adopt a cognitive style at
<br>
variance with what is considered mental health and demand freedom
<br>
of cognition?  I have no doubt that legal systems will adapt, it
<br>
will just take a while and perhaps a few celebrated cases. It is 
<br>
our job to prepare the philosophical groundwork of how this can be 
<br>
used in an acceptable way.
