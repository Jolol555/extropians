Just a quick off the cuff quip.
<br>
What I see as the really limiting factor would be water.
<br>
Water has agricultural, residential competing uses.
<br>
Land usage for towers is not an issue as there are always scrap,
<br>
orphaned sites the size of a big house, which is all a tower really
<br>
needs.
<br>
Tower alignment to allow minimum interference with crop dusting planes
<br>
is alos an issue.
<br>
However, waste water from dehydrating agricultural produce, dewatering
<br>
sewage and other industrial use water would make excellent feedstock for
<br>
hydrogen production.
<br>
I see on site electricity as a real asset to the agricultural community
<br>
with only excess production put back into the grid.

<em>&gt;      &lt;&lt;The &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; has been promoted for years by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      environmental activists and alternative-energy gurus like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Amory Lovins. But hydrogen is not a source of energy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      something which hydrogen advocates either don't understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      or refuse to acknowledge. Since hydrogen does not exist in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      geological reservoirs it must be extracted from fossil-fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      feedstocks or water. The process of extracting hydrogen uses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      energy, which means that using hydrogen is less efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      that burning fossil fuels. And if you're worried about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      global warming you certainly don't want to go that route. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      a recent energy-technology review in Science magazine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      pointed out last November, &quot;Per unit of heat generated, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      CO2 is produced by making H2 [hydrogen] from fossil fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      than by burning the fossil fuel directly.&quot; &gt;&gt;
