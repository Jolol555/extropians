Ron h noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Sorry Kai,
<br>
       When the US was a 3rd world country nobody much cared that we called 
<br>
ourselves America.  It was only when we became a 1st world country that you 
<br>
discovered we were unworthy.  But then the news is out that 80 of your 
<br>
companies are trading with Sadaam so you accuse us to cover yourself.
<br>
       Anyway, it is good to hear from a friend of Sadaam and Osama, thanks 
<br>
for writing.  At least we now know where your preferences lay -- with the 
<br>
totalitarians and oppressors.
<br>
Ron h.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yeah, I had wondered about that in his posts. So the USA should be good 
<br>
liitle victims and ignore 9-11? Lets just let the Islamic miltants arm, and 
<br>
strike the US at leisure. OK. We can't upset our beloved international 
<br>
allies, uhuh. Well, in the zero-sum game of victimizer and victims, I opt for 
<br>
the role of victimizer. Or as Robert Heinlein's Lazarus Long said: Its easier 
<br>
being a live lion then a dead duck, and far easier. Lets also ask the 
<br>
question, which our enemies might agree with us: Why does the USA still have 
<br>
troops in rich Europe? Can't these people defend themselves? Should we 
<br>
&quot;defend&quot; them from the new Russia? Will they turn on each other, when we 
<br>
leave. Ah well, they are all friends, with the dual national thing perhaps 
<br>
comming into view. This should be interesting.
