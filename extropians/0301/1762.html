Damien,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that sometimes Aussies, Europeans and non Southern Americans 
<br>
fall into an error when listening to Bush and other Christian 
<br>
Fundamentalists.  Heck, I've even heard one person that I postively identify 
<br>
as a southern fundamentalist in origin make the same mistake -- and worse 
<br>
than you or some others.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation goes like this: It is an old joke from the American 
<br>
South.  &quot;Do you know why liquor stores have a light over the back door down 
<br>
south?&quot;  &quot;So Southern Baptists can buy their liquor.&quot;  I can assure you that 
<br>
regardless of the reason when I was a boy and a teener liquor stores in small 
<br>
southern towns had a light over the back door.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson I would like you to take from that joke is don't get so 
<br>
uptight.  On one level he means every word of what he is saying.  On another 
<br>
he is very familiar with the fact that most don't agree with him.  If you are 
<br>
willing to forgive him his little ways he can live with yours.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, would you go one step more with me?  If you read St. Paul you 
<br>
will find he has considerable latitude that is left to individual 
<br>
interpretation but believes firmly that it is wrong to tempt others.  That 
<br>
leaves him with a set of public manners that are stricter than his private 
<br>
ones.  There is no double dealing here.  He honestly believes that his public 
<br>
behavior should not temp others.  When he is alone and with others that see 
<br>
eye to eye with him conditions ease up a little.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand when it comes to his love of country and willingness 
<br>
to defend the US there is probably no more slack in him than he says up 
<br>
front.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some see his service in the Texas Air National Guard as betraying a 
<br>
faint hearted patriot.  I know something of military aviation and I think the 
<br>
total package of facts betrays the unwillingness of the American Air Force to 
<br>
trust him with one of its best aircraft.  There is a fair amount of evidence 
<br>
to make me think he just wasn't a good enough pilot to hand him a front line 
<br>
fighter and let him take it into any arena that required a good pilot.  I 
<br>
flew one airplane that was fairly high performance but not nearly up to the 
<br>
F4 Phantom.  That airplane I flew would kill a neophyte in a heartbeat and it 
<br>
was just a trainer.  That trainer did kill guys.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just get the idea from looking at the airplane they put George into 
<br>
that they didn't want him in a Phantom or one of the other front line 
<br>
aircraft.  George Sr. had a reputation as a very good pilot.  But I heard 
<br>
once that he was scared to death every time George the younger took off.
<br>
