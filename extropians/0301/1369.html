<em>&gt; Chances are this is going to change over the next few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades, as more effective drugs are found, with fewer side 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects.  In a way, it's good that older people suffer mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deficits, as it provides a socially acceptable justification 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for research into medications that enhance mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance.  As good drugs are found they may well leak down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the healthier segments of the population.  Eventually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stigma will hopefully break down and people will adopt a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more Extropian attitude towards enhancing their minds.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for posting this Hal.  
<br>
<p>Regarding the social questions brought up by smart drugs, I agree with
<br>
you that over the next decade or two it will become increasingly
<br>
&quot;normal&quot; to take mind-altering drugs for performance enhancement.  In
<br>
addition to all the usual drivers of enhancement technology, I would
<br>
pay special attention to the pharmaceutical companies themselves.
<br>
Several of the major firms researching drugs for alzheimers and senile
<br>
dementia have stated that they're interested in the potential wider
<br>
market for those drugs among the &quot;healthy&quot; population.
<br>
<p>We know that in general human mental function declines slightly with
<br>
age.  I predict that we'll see the medicalization of this phenomenon.
<br>
Once age-related mental decline is considered a medical condition, it
<br>
will become more and more acceptable to prescribe drugs to &quot;combat&quot;
<br>
it.  I think you can see a precursor to this both in the Prozac
<br>
example you mention, and also more clearly in the example of ADHD.
<br>
Both depression and ADHD are threshold phenomena, and the minimum
<br>
thresholds for diagnosis have been steadily creeping towards the
<br>
center of the curve. I'm already seeing mentions in Medline and
<br>
scientific journals of &quot;Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)&quot;.  Once they
<br>
give it an acronym, you can see it's headed towards medicalization.
<br>
<p>See this Forbes article from February of '02 for an overview of
<br>
potential smart drugs in the pipeline of major pharmaceutical firms:
