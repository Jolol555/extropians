Frankly I am bit pissed by Americans always blaming us to only look
<br>
onto our economic situation. If that were so, then why I am not for a
<br>
war???
<br>
<p>Let me explain: As some of you know, I am working on a Spiking Neural
<br>
Network simulator. A particular application I am currently working on
<br>
is a central nervous system for insect like robots (with insect like
<br>
intelligence). Now what is a good application for, say, 400 pound
<br>
heavy, six legged robots that can move fast in rugged terrain?
<br>
<p>You guessed it: Robot fighters. Now there is no hope to get any money
<br>
for that from Bundeswehr. An inflamed middle east would change that
<br>
dramatically. I could suddenly sell my Honda Civic and get a BMW for me
<br>
and a Lamborghini for my wife. According to your assessment of European
<br>
menthality: Why do I need to care for the rest of the German economy as
<br>
long as I prosper? So I must be stupid not to be all for war, as much
<br>
war as possible!

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It does indeed. The US could lose the war, for instance. Saddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strategy in the last wars was stupid, to say something polite. Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; against Iran and the US he was copying the Verdun 1916 situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wasn't successful against Iran and against the US, it was a pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desaster because the US forces did not need to fight this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they used their superior air force to smash them. Now what happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Saddam distributes his army in the cities, basically hiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children and women. The US forces would need to fight for each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every house. Is the US prepared for another gorilla war after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Vietnam?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A guerrilla war occurs when the insurgents are un-uniformed, do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heavy weapons, and have the support of the common people. Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiers have none of these, they will be using their own people as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hostages. All we need to do is go in at night, when our NVG
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works and they don't have any. Street fighting is not so difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a tactical advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. The US forces get too lax and make a mistake. Iraqi ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; launch a fast attack on Saudi/Kuwait territory, forcing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US forces into a large scale ground battle?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sure the last thing the iraqis want is to piss off Saudis. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will more likely do is attack Israel with missiles, likely laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with WMD. This will bring dancing in the streets across the muslim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, and the reply by Isreal will make things difficult for us, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; After a first success there might be other Arabian leaders joining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; war on Saddam's side and suddenly we have the war here in Europe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hate to see Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW produce robots-of-war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of luxury cars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yeah, it's too bad they might impact the european economy to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ours already has been by 9/11. It would just be 'orrible if your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average european couldn't afford as much brie and wine as s/he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is because we believe that, if Saddam does not yield,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; action may eventually be the least awful necessity for Iraq, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Middle East and for the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; .... since awful oil prices like we have now are not good for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; economy. Bombing Iraq into the ground will lead to plenty of orders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; after the war. Siemens can sell a pro West Iraq all the nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plants they don't need and Lockheed can rebuild the Iraqi air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; All payed with cheap oil. Wonderful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who in his right state of mind believes that humanitarian issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the Bush family's equation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am positive that Dubya's primary personal goal is to settle a score
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and right a mistake of his father. However, this does not make what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is doing wrong. It is alright to do the right things for the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons.
