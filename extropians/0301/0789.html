Despite my bleat about
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.infocastinc.com/NBIC/nbic.asp">http://www.infocastinc.com/NBIC/nbic.asp</a>
</em><br>
<p>this really does look mindboggling. Talk about being in the future at last.
<br>
Here's the full agenda. Check out the topics and the calibre of the people
<br>
talking, and their subject matter (I still recall the sarcastic derision of
<br>
leading thinkers in Oz when THE SPIKE came out a few years ago; now they'll
<br>
probably be paid to fly over for this thing):
