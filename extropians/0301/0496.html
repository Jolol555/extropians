In a message dated 1/10/2003 12:05:48 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:charleshixsn@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Disbelieving%20in%20belief%20-%20a%20variant">charleshixsn@earthlink.net</a> writes: &quot;Rights cannot, per se, be relied on.  And 
<br>
it doesn't matter how righteously you personally have acted.  Rights are a 
<br>
social contract, and only exist in the context of that contract.  When the 
<br>
balence of power shifts drastically, expect that the social contract will be 
<br>
re-written by the party with a new and more dominant role.&quot;
<br>
<p>For centurys this was true.  Then one day along came a group of men that 
<br>
threw out the local ruler.  These men felt that their rights were from nature 
<br>
and nature's God.  These rights were the possession of the individual and 
<br>
were not received from the state.  In fact they felt they had to have a 
<br>
government but that at the same time government was the greatest threat to 
<br>
their safety and welfare.  So they formed a new government under a 
<br>
constitution and decided what powers they wished the central government to 
<br>
have.  To maintain ultimate power over the society in their own hands they 
<br>
wrote into the constitution certain guarentees of their power -- among these 
<br>
are the right to speak freely and the right to bear arms.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so this &quot;social contract&quot; has lasted far longer than the competing 
<br>
&quot;social contracts&quot; of the day.  You see, most men if left free to pursue 
<br>
their own self interest would rather work for their own fulfullment than to 
<br>
seek power over other men.
