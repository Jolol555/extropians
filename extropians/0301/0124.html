<em>&gt; &gt; It would be pretty crazy to suppose that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism or transhumanity could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aligned with racism!  I have no idea how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a thought could enter anyone's head.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Is it a matter of entry point?  I was looking at the principles of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropy.  If one believed those principles and evolved to believing that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practicing those principles would raise us to a higher level of humanity we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might end up with a superman theory but not racist or anti any ethnic group.
</em><br>
<p>That is correct.  In fact, this is a difference between
<br>
&quot;Extropy&quot; and &quot;Transhumanism&quot; that I had wanted to point
<br>
out.  It's currently not possible to be a racist and an
<br>
Extropian, because the term &quot;Extropy&quot; was invented by
<br>
a person to convey a certain concept.  One of the principle
<br>
components of this concept explicitly moves beyond racist
<br>
thinking.
<br>
<p>In philosophy, one might say that &quot;Extropy&quot; is a synthetic
<br>
concept and &quot;transhuman&quot; an analytic concept.
<br>
<p>While I've admitted that I don't know what the WTA types
<br>
are up to and don't much care---even if many of them are 
<br>
Extropians---I do know that no one will get away with 
<br>
defining &quot;transhuman&quot; or &quot;transhumanism&quot;.  The term is
<br>
too analytic; it's simply too obvious what is the general
<br>
form of what is being conveyed.  It's very obvious that
<br>
all sorts of people who we don't like will call themselves
<br>
transhuman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        However if one started as a racist of some type one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would evolve an entirely different type superman theory.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, though it would have to have a powerful historical
<br>
component to be able to logically sustain racism, or,
<br>
what is equivalent, a terrific sense of ethnic pride.
<br>
