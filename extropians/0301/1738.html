</em><br>
There might, however, be some doubts as to the proper techniques to 
<br>
achieve these ends:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(1) non-proliferation of WMD
</em><br>

</em><br>
Considering that nobody strong is being attacked, the lesson learned 
<br>
might be &quot;Achieve redundant delivery capability before you are caught&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(2) diminishing support for terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Reports from Egypt indicate that the opposite is being accomplished.  
<br>
The government is using violent methods to suppress dissent, resulting 
<br>
in an increase of violent opposition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(3) breaking monopolistic control of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This isn't being attempted.  Be honest.  The US govt. is attempting to 
<br>
place monopolistic control of oil under it's control.   Some say that 
<br>
it's the oil companies, and that the govt. is merely a front.  
<br>
Plausible.  But whoever is doing this, they aren't planning to make the 
<br>
rewards available to all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(4) punishing the abrogation of treaties and agreements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Perhaps.  Some of them, anyway.  If the other side is sufficently powerful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(5) giving the evil and murderous Iraqi regime what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    it richly deserves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
OK.  I grant that.  Giving them evil and murder might be seen as 
<br>
equitable.  But the main people who end up paying won't be the people 
<br>
who were, themselves, evil and murderous.  So I can't see feeling good 
<br>
about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(6) instilling fear in small dictatorships in general, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    also respect for the West's values on human rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Try &quot;instilling fear in governments in general, if they have anything 
<br>
that they think the US govt. might someday want&quot;.
<br>
<p>The Iraqui government is evil and vile.  And we put them in power.  We 
<br>
can't claim clean hands, or a high moral ground here.  Self-interest we 
<br>
can claim.  If we lied a bit less, I think that people would be more 
<br>
accepting.  At least they'd have a chance of knowing where they stood.
<br>
<p>E.g.:  There's a lot of vile and evil governments on the planet.  Iraq 
<br>
isn't the worst.  So claiming that that's why the US govt. is going 
<br>
after them is silly.  There are reasons, but they don't become stronger 
<br>
by lying about them.
<br>
<p>P.S.:  If you made a deal with someone who held a knife to your throat, 
<br>
would you feel that honor compelled you to abide by it?  Practicality 
<br>
might, but I can't see that honor would.  So I can't feel self-righteous 
<br>
about Iraq breaking the treaties that they agreed to.  Saddened, yes.  
<br>
But I don't see it as demonstrating that they are without honor.  Merely 
<br>
that they are trying to weasle out of a promise that they made to a 
<br>
bully.  In a manner that appears to me to be foolish.  (But I'm also not 
<br>
sure of the evidence.  Different people seem to be giving different 
<br>
stories, so Iraq may just be being set up.  [Well, Saddam doesn't 
<br>
deserve any sympathy ... but neither do most governmental leaders.])
