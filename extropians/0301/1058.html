<p>Unextropic? This whole war option is unextropic. Relying on war to address
<br>
symptoms of bigger problems; it's the attitude &quot;If you can't fix it with a
<br>
hammer, you can't fix it&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Some random related points off the top of my head:
<br>
- Get off oil. There are a *lot* of alternatives these days, which just need
<br>
some investment.
<br>
<p>- The planet's surface is 80% water. Why is there a water problem? There
<br>
must be *some* way to get water somewhere else than from the nearest river.
<br>
<p>- Why can't we cooperate? What's the story with the whole nation gig,
<br>
anyway? Why do we get bucketloads of implicit and explicit nationalism and
<br>
jingoism on extro-l of all places?
<br>
<p>- The spread of religious memes is not inevitable, it's just what is
<br>
currently happening. Why do these millenia old religions appeal to people;
<br>
how can we fix that?
<br>
<p>- If you intend to wage war for peace and freedom, to free people from the
<br>
chains of their oppressors, surely you would open your borders to those same
<br>
people. In fact, if much of the world is oppressed by dictators, and you
<br>
decide you have to beat them (ie: their people) senseless/dead in order to
<br>
free them from their chains, why wouldn't you fight also to open borders? It
<br>
seems that these arguments rely on the fact that people are not free to
<br>
choose for themselves where they would live, thus allowing dictators. A
<br>
power that was concerned with fixing this would be trying to establish the
<br>
freedom of movement for all peoples, and using clobering powers to enforce
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>etc etc etc
