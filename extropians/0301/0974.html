<br>
I have ever encountred on this list.  President Bush is a grade-A jerk who 
<br>
should never ever have been allowed into the oval office.  He is a clear and 
<br>
present danger to this country and to world peace and stability.  Where 
<br>
exactly are these brilliant answers?
<br>
<p>Yes, Samantha, but did you happen to read for content?  Or far better did you 
<br>
happen to read the email that did a wonderful job of explaining this issue?  
<br>
Alternatively did you just grab a phrase you could make something out of and 
<br>
blast off for outer space.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example you made a comment in one of your postings about Bush, &quot;He 
<br>
is a useful idiot, useful to those who do not have America's best interest as 
<br>
their agenda.&quot;  In the first place I doubt you have any idea what either his 
<br>
IQ or his GPA is.  Having graduated a rival MBA program I truly doubt you 
<br>
have any idea what the program for MBAs at Harvard or Chicago is.  In any 
<br>
case you over look the abysmal academic record of Al Gore to criticize Bush.  
<br>
You and your friends chant about Bush the son of Bush and ignore Gore the son 
<br>
of Gore or Kennedy the son of Kennedy and the brother of Kennedy &amp; Kennedy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you toss this in &quot;What is this &quot;we&quot;?  You will sit this one out 
<br>
due to age and cheer other &quot;boys&quot; on to their death in a more senseless 
<br>
conflict than even Vietnam was.  Bully for you.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Vietnam that was debated extensively on this list recently and 
<br>
another person documented that all the documentary support for the North 
<br>
Vietnamese position was a lie.  In turn all of your position is based on a 
<br>
lie told by the North Vietnamese.  However that lie was more attractive to 
<br>
you than the truth told by your own country.  If David Horowitz is to be 
<br>
believed he and some friends of his organized the peace movement, never lost 
<br>
control of it, and led folks like you around by the nose.  According to Mr. 
<br>
Horowitz it was all intended to be harmful to international position of the 
<br>
United States.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to your remarks about sitting the war out.  I am a hawk.  I do have 
<br>
a DD214 as requested yesterday.  But you have no idea what ever what goes 
<br>
through the mind of a silver haired hawk.  You know only to grab a handy 
<br>
slogan that you can shout in front of your private Amen chorus.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask you a question?  Those of us that are hawks on this list, 
<br>
who do you suppose we value the most, you or a young hawk that might in 
<br>
theory have to ship overseas someday?  You are right.  Most of us consider 
<br>
that young hawk, male or female, to be far more valuable than you.  Not only 
<br>
that we consider it our duty to be sure you don't waste those young hawks.  
<br>
You and Johnson sent the hawks to Vietnam in 64 to win an election.  You 
<br>
cheered and voted, Johnson won and handcuffed the men doing the fighting, 
<br>
then when they returned home you spat on those young men and women -- they 
<br>
had only gone there because you drafted them.
