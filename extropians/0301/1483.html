<p>
Or another subject line might be &quot;Europe demonstrates its stupidity&quot;.
<br>
<p>The article: &quot;GM cows to please cheese-makers&quot;.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/print.jsp?id=ns99993307">http://www.newscientist.com/news/print.jsp?id=ns99993307</a>
<br>
<p>Bottom line -- Europe will have to allow its cheese makers
<br>
(not a *small* business in Europe) to import and use GM cows
<br>
to produce its cheese (if they do not do this they aren't
<br>
competitive on a cost basis) or ban the import of cheese from
<br>
New Zealand or other countries using such animals (presumably
<br>
violating various free-trade agreements).
<br>
<p>Interestingly, since cheese is &quot;protein&quot; and not &quot;DNA&quot;
<br>
(though I do not know the extent to which cheese might
<br>
contain some fraction of DNA), the argument with respect
<br>
to the transfer of genetic material, genetic corruption, etc.
<br>
becomes *much* reduced with respect to cheese derived from
<br>
GM cows.
<br>
<p>It is a really *stupid* argument in the first place since both
<br>
cows and the bacteria one applies to the milk to produce cheese
<br>
have been *highly* bred/selected by humans.  They are certainly
<br>
not &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;green&quot; (whatever that means).
<br>
<p>The only point of this message is to recall how over the last
<br>
several years Greg and I have had some duels with regard to
<br>
how significant the &quot;green&quot; movement might be with respect to
<br>
negative impacts on the use of genetically modified organisms.
<br>
I have consistently maintained GMO will trump green.  I simply
<br>
offer up the above news item as a case where technological
<br>
progress is backing green into a smaller and smaller corner
<br>
of the playing field.
<br>
<p>[I will note as an aside that I strongly support *sustainability*
<br>
which is a very limited subset of what is generally involved
<br>
in the green/organic mentality.]
<br>
