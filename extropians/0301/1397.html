Kai stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;So, the prime goal has not been achieved&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes indeed, and I fault the administration for this tactic.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;IMHO, an elegant way would be to improve the self-marketing of the 
<br>
western principles, which would dry out the basis for hatred and false 
<br>
beliefs.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, if you are saying people lead best by example, I heartilly, agree. 
<br>
However, with the Islamic Militant mentality, your success will likely 
<br>
produce increased hatred through that magical, word...envy. They would envy 
<br>
and hate us more for our success then our good intentions.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Once you drop onto this level, all moral principles become invalid and it 
<br>
will be 
<br>
extremely difficult to earn back any respect for them.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not so confident as moral principles, as you.  After viewing world 
<br>
history, I tend to hold honesty and humor above moral principles; as a 
<br>
guiding human value. Moral principles will not withstand a jihadi bomb.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Please stop your imputations that I would sympathize with dictators or 
<br>
terrorists. I don't. And I don't support aggression, neither from terrorist, 
<br>
nor from allies. It's fine that the Taliban regime is destroyed, but the 
<br>
problem will not be solved until a stable, free and democratic society has 
<br>
been established with the support and 
<br>
understanding of the people there.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Undertstand that the US went after the Taleban because they had co-mingled 
<br>
with Al Qeida. We went into Afghanistan for our own selfish reason-to 
<br>
retaliate and disrupt the attackers of 9-11, from their base. If the Afghani 
<br>
people were freed, that came as a side-effect. Had the Taleban turned over 
<br>
Osama, we likely would never had invaded.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It's not enough to destroy the oppressor; you have to support the 
<br>
development process afterwards and the positive forces of that country. 
<br>
The only one positive example in history I can remember, where an 
<br>
oppressive regime has been destroyed, a nation been freed and then be 
<br>
helped to develop a stable, democratic society is Germany - because it 
<br>
was needed in the upcoming cold war. That's why Marshall won over 
<br>
Morgenthau.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am not so sure, Morgenthau wasn't right. Turn Deutschland into 3 or 4 large 
<br>
cantons and make them pacifist. It appears to be the direction Schroeder 
<br>
wants anyway, so perhaps Morgenthau was prescien?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Uh-oh, we should be very careful with accusations in this area. The 
<br>
whole US space program of the 50s to the 70s has been lead by former 
<br>
Nazi followers. Von Braun even was a member of the SS and has surely 
<br>
known where the forced labor in Peenemünde came from. The former german 
<br>
rocket team got clearance from the US military, approved by the 
<br>
government, which was clearly against the US law at that time. And if we 
<br>
really go back into that time, we shouldn't forget the grandfather of 
<br>
G.W.Bush, who was convicted 1942 for being a collaborator with the 
<br>
Nazis. I don't think it makes any sense to dig out rotten corpses.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Clearly, the US (and Soviets) used German scientists who were invariably 
<br>
member of the Partei, and yes even Von Braun was a SS member.  I recall Von 
<br>
Braun being a childhood hero of mine. Funny, that he could've murdered 
<br>
relatives of mine at Norhausen, perhaps?  GW Bush (Granddad) surely was an 
<br>
syncophant to Hitler, and one reason never to trust Bush Sr (a failed 
<br>
Presdient) and to have doubts about Jr. But, as the saying goes, the truth 
<br>
will out.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In my opinion, this vicious circle will endlessly feed the extremist 
<br>
groups. The more aggressive the West acts, the more aggressive and 
<br>
dangerous this enemy will become. To break the circle, we either have to 
<br>
kill every possible follower, which are many millions of people or find 
<br>
better ways than military strikes.
<br>
<p>    Kai&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If the Muslim world wants to go off the deep end because it craves to blame 
<br>
the USA for all its ills they, or anyone else are welcome to try.
