<em>&gt; &gt;*this one* comes from the leader of government business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the lower house. Tony Abbott MP. Looks pretty similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I believe (sic) that life (sic) begins at conception. I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that any other points we might choose are essentially arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and uncertain. And I believe that this is a view founded not in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religion, not in faith,but on the logic of the matter. ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Let me make this very clear: even if destroying embryos to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; harvest their stem cells could create the medical miracles, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which are now so commonly claimed, I would be against it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because there are some things that we cannot do, no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how good the cause.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But wouldn't it have meant exactly the same thing if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he had said, &quot;My working hypothesis is that human existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begins at conception, and I contend that this is a view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founded not in religion, not in faith, but on logic.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and had gone on to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I am against snuffing out human existence in principle.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that he would be saying exactly the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, no?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It think that we have an *ontological* dispute in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he considers human beings to be absent/present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over tiny changes in the physical situation, and tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes in t.
</em><br>
<p>The proposition I am putting to you Lee is that there is a larger
<br>
issue here than the mere ontological point. If we call the guy who
<br>
made the original unmodified statement Tony-A and the one who
<br>
made the modified statement Tony-B would you really have no
<br>
preference over whether Tony-A or Tony-B was casting a vote
<br>
on stem cell policy that was likely to directly effect the rate at 
<br>
which treatments for a variety of diseases might be found and 
<br>
ultimately cures might be found?. 
<br>
<p>Would you prefer to have Tony-A or Tony-B deciding on
<br>
what laws are going to be enacted in relation to stem cells, 
<br>
genetic engineering, and cryonics and what rights you would
<br>
have as a citizen of the State and what limits would be placed
<br>
on your liberty?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; They start from a position of faith or belief assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that as an axiom and reason from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I .....start from the axiom &quot;suffering is bad&quot; (that's me!)
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the infant Lee Corbin came into the world
<br>
loaded with many &quot;axioms&quot; at all. I also think that by the
<br>
time you learnt what the word axiom meant your thinking
<br>
would have developed way past the point where you
<br>
would have thought suffering is bad in every case. I don't
<br>
think there is an *actual* as opposed to a theoretical or
<br>
philosophical state in which you do, or ever did, &quot;*start*
<br>
from the axiom 'suffering is bad'&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now yes, in general, I'm with you and I *do* have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with axiomatic schemes.  
</em><br>
<p>In what respect are you *with me*? What do you take to be
<br>
my main contention in this thread (that you are with me on)?
