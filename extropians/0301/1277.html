<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Scientists at NASA and Kansas University have determined that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;supernova would need to be within 26 light years from Earth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;significantly damage the ozone layer and allow cancer-causing ultraviolet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;radiation to saturate the Earth's surface.
</em><br>
<p>Their results (at least in terms of time scales) *do* seem to be in
<br>
conflict with the Dar and Dr Rujula results with respect to times
<br>
between gamma ray bursts.
<br>
<p>(So we may not have to worry about supernovas, but we may have to worry
<br>
about GRB which are far worse if your planet happens to be in the
<br>
&quot;cone of extinction&quot; (side ref to the infamous &quot;cone of silence&quot;
<br>
which people who watched TV in the U.S. in the '60s may get).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;*One* thing less to worry about.
</em><br>
<p>Loss of the ozone layer from supernova's I can deal with (so I wasn't
<br>
worried in the first place).  The GRB on the other hand make for a really
<br>
really bad couple of days.
<br>
<p>I think the loss of the ozone layer and an increase in UV radiation is
<br>
*very* overblown.  Back when I was studying biology, the conventional
<br>
wisdom was that humans didn't even have a photolyase enzyme to repair
<br>
UV induced DNA damage (I'm unsure if they have found one or more in
<br>
the process of the HGP).  If we can survive reasonably well without
<br>
that then UV tolerance isn't *that* important to our survival.
<br>
<p>For heaven's sake -- humans could simply go back to living in caves
<br>
(many of us spend much of our time without exposure to the sun as it is).
<br>
<p>I'll admit that there may be problems with cows or sheep going blind
<br>
prematurely but the long term evolution of our species should be in
<br>
the direction of eliminating them as food sources anyway.
<br>
<p>We don't have any good benchmarks for how rapidly species could up-regulate
<br>
or develop more robust DNA repair in the face of an increase in the amount
<br>
of UV radiation -- we do however know (from Deinococcus) that it *is*
<br>
feasible to be very UV radiation tolerant.
<br>
<p>Eliezer noted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No, this is *poor* news, because it eliminates one of the *less* forboding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explanations for the Great Filter.
</em><br>
<p>As I state above, I think surviving the loss of an ozone layer and/or
<br>
dealing with an increase in UV flux is something most technological
<br>
civilizations could manage.  So the NASA results don't significantly
<br>
impact the GF situation IMO.  Even if one knocks &quot;life&quot; back to the
<br>
Deinococcus level every half-billion years, there still seems to be
<br>
a reasonable amount of evidence one can make it back up to our level
<br>
(multiple times in the lifetime of a star like the sun).
<br>
<p>Now, *I* at least would not consider a GRB &quot;sterilization event&quot;
<br>
as &quot;non-forboding&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anders notes:
<br>
<em>&gt; I have always considered the supernova argument for the GF unlikely. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are relatively rare compared to the likely timescales of intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution and technology, making the variance in the number of novas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the critical period before sufficiently strong technology large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to let quite a few civs through the filter.
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to agree.  As I've argued (though most don't seem to get
<br>
it) the answer to the GF seems to be in the evolution of technological
<br>
civilizations -- replication becomes hard (expensive) and potentially
<br>
self-defeating and so should be discontinued as a behavior.  One only
<br>
has to read Malthus or Dyson and think about this a bit to realize
<br>
that at some point one has to regulate ones growth.
