Hal Finney:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;If you were a disabled person with a hereditary defect, would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to procreate (supposing that embryo screening to eliminate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defect were not possible)?  Would it be right for you to clone yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it is perfected?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my experience we move too quickly from the question of what is right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the question of what is allowed.  These are very difficult and complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues, but all too soon we are trying to decide the matter not only for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves, but for our neighbors as well.
</em><br>
<p>Another fine post by Hal, but I wonder how easy it is to make this
<br>
distinction when the basic physical or mental integrity of a new human being
<br>
is at stake. Suppose a grown phocomelus wishes to have a child just like
<br>
herself? This might be arranged via access to thalidomide at her embryo's
<br>
appropriate developmental stage. Is this a right course of conduct? Ought
<br>
other adults in the vicinity to intervene to prevent it? If thalidomide
<br>
doesn't work, might she then ethically truncate the baby's limbs by surgery
<br>
to ensure that she has brought into existence some more people like herself,
<br>
with her special rich idiosyncratic way of being-in-the-world? (I should
<br>
stress at once that this is a thought experiment; I don't know of any tragic
<br>
victim of thalidomide who would consider for a moment doing this to another
<br>
human. But we know that many congenitally deaf or dwarfed people are eager
<br>
to do the equivalent.) But is it easier to reach a personal or public policy
<br>
conclusion about such a case than it is for the imposition of what one might
<br>
construe as mental deformities, via strict upbringing in preposterous or
<br>
harmful memetic systems? And which of us should then 'scape whipping?
