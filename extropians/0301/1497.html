<p>
There is a major changing of the gaurd happening  here.
<br>
<p>Cretien is leaving in 6 months.  His heir apparant is 65 so is not
<br>
there for a long time.
<br>
The liberals have governed with a surplus thanks to low  interest rates
<br>
on old debt.
<br>
Some of the brighter lights have been ditched.  One in particular, Allan
<br>
Rock, the guy who launched the medical marijuana industry in Canada, is
<br>
off the roost   because he got tarred with
<br>
a gun registry  cost-overrun.   It  was first budgeted  in 1995 at 2
<br>
million and then hid as a budget item so that now is &quot;locked in&quot; to
<br>
costs that near a billion.  The registry was so poor that the deadline
<br>
for 200,000 to 2 million  as yet unregistered  guns  to declare/register
<br>
was dec31, 2002.  The online registry,voice mail and fax were all
<br>
overloaded into a reverse  denial of service attack the last few days of
<br>
2002.  I just left an email on Dec 31 saying that when they had a system
<br>
able to respond that I intended to register my 3 guns.  A month later I
<br>
have get a response or even an  acknowledgement.
<br>
<p>I joked that it is going to take all the gov'ts profits from a number of
<br>
fees and taxes from  the imminent take-over of the marijuana industry
<br>
to pay for the gun registry.  After all you can't have people running
<br>
around loose with guns robbing your marijuana stores.. EH!
<br>
<p>The conservative party is looking for a new leader.  There are no Brian
<br>
Mulroney's from places like the Iron Ore Company of Canada  at close
<br>
hand.  Actually Brian Mulroney came back from places like his VP job
<br>
with ADM (archer daniels midland) to try to flush out order from chaos.
<br>
<p>The Alliance has  just changed its name  from the Reform party and
<br>
reorganized  with a young but untested leader after skewering its
<br>
former  leader.  The  party paid its former leader's  legal bills when
<br>
he slandered someone about an abortion related issue.... that and a few
<br>
gafs and missteps had  cost him his leadership.
<br>
<p>The most socialist, the NDP just elected a new leader yesterday.  This
<br>
guy and his wife are both
<br>
Toronto city councillors.  The Toronto Extropians might have comments on
<br>
this pair.
<br>
Is he a &quot;Pierre Trudeau&quot; living from a fringe party?...
<br>
<p>So the only thing for sure about Canadian Politics is that an era of one
<br>
party rule is about over and  the new landscape is not entirely clear.
<br>
<p>RE- Europe/USA- my point was that countries like people can  become
<br>
functional specialists.  Not everyone has to be a policeman.  The USA
<br>
military technology  lead however should  give them the first shot at
<br>
commercializing civilian applications.  EU and Canada are better going
<br>
after the bio-sector.  Global warming could  make Canada a  many fold
<br>
major producer of bio-products.
<br>
<p>You are right about the entrepreneurial spirit of the USA. In Canada
<br>
when we want something to happen we ask the government to do it for us.
<br>
In the USA you buy an investor database and get those phones and
<br>
business plans  rolling.  Recently farmers were jailed for  refusing to
<br>
pay fines for selling their wheat in Montana and North Dakota without
<br>
Govenment permission.  Security does not always mean freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, in my own, typically, arrogant, American way; allow me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest that the aforementioned societies you have listed, benefit, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large part, from the US taxpayer footing the bill for a huge chuck of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their security. :-)  I mean, one can't afford socialized medicine, top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the line education, and keep the Russian Bear (of Soviet vintage)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Chinese dragon at bay.  Or rather we might, but that also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would entail (me thinks) raising tariffs, and becoming Festung
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American (fortress).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To do that, it would take more unity of purpose then the US has, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far, exhibited
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do think that using the UN to  chop down the borders of rogue states
<br>
is preferred to
<br>
all out war.  The one thing not to do is rape a country economically
<br>
like Germany was after WW1.
<br>
This leads to radicalism like the 3rd Reich.  The middle east feels
<br>
culturally threatened and will
<br>
risk world war to protect its culture.  The culture is  just  a bit
<br>
right of &quot;Klingon&quot;.  Cultures do not evaporate overnight.
<br>
<p>Countries like EU and Canada are willing to expend social oriented
<br>
militarism in preference to
<br>
supporting first strikes at war.  Military technology to  support this
<br>
can still create civilian spin-offs.
<br>
<p><p>bye for now..MJ
