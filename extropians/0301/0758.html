<em>&gt; &gt; How do we balance the risk to our children against our desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reproduce?  When is it OK to use a new technology to have a child that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would not otherwise be possible, if that technology also carries an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increased risk of birth defects?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### We could extend currently accepted practices as follows - since we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not prohibit the reproduction of persons who produce only, or predominantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very sick offspring, we have to accept any attempt at reproduction, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how unlikely to produce healthy children. However, we could decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there must be a certain minimal level of &quot;expected health&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>The pronoun &quot;we&quot; occurs five times in the above four sentences.
<br>
<p>Hal has suggested that perhaps the question &quot;who decides?&quot; should
<br>
often be deferred during discussions about what is desirable.
<br>
But the whole point of Sowell's &quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, which
<br>
I've had to consult lately, is that deciding the *level* at which
<br>
different decisions occur is crucial to society's well-being.
<br>
<p>Why not leave all these decisions to the people most closely
<br>
affected?  They have the knowledge of their particular situations
<br>
aspirations!  Is it because we feel that they may make a mistake?
<br>
<p>To take Hal's question in the best way, then.  What if I and
<br>
my spouse (a) wish to have exactly one child (b) want to bring
<br>
into the world the healthiest, smartest, happiest, best person
<br>
we can, how should we balance the risk and benefit?
<br>
<p>Let's not forget the way that people often decide such questions,
<br>
namely, they watch the practice evolve.  If it seems to be going
<br>
well for people, if their friends and family approve, then they
<br>
go for it.  So we have yet another reason to allow people the
<br>
freedom in such matters: we learn by experimentation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another tack would be to require insurance for costs of extended care of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disabled children, and costs of wrongful life suits brought by the children,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including capped punitive damages.  This would discourage frivolous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduction, and provide for the needs of the disabled, without burdening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the public purse.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry for being in a terminally terminological mood, but
<br>
I can't help but observe your preference for words like
<br>
&quot;require&quot; and &quot;discourage&quot;, and &quot;punitive&quot; and &quot;damages&quot;.
<br>
Where did you say you came from, again?
