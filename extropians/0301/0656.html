<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, &quot;intuitively&quot; I don't feel the presence of any natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laws (outside physics).  I guess I never have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can be scientifically rigorous without being pathologically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reductionist.
</em><br>
<p>Ahem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even in physics one can often aggregate and simplify and apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;laws&quot; to complex systems that are useful even though they may or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not have direct physical existence in waves and particles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In designing aircraft, for example, we have formulas for things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like lift and drag which are really just shortcut ways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describing the aggregate behavior of lots of individual air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molecules bouncing off lots of metal molecules, all mediated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electromagnetic forces.  But actually describing the behavior of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every molecule would be silly--lift and drag formulas work well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enable us to accomplish more with less work.  Even something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as simple as Boyle's law of gases is really just a shortcut for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ways gas molecules behave in the aggregate.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely correct.  These patterns have objective existence
<br>
whether or not humankind has gotten around to identifying
<br>
them and placing them in textbooks, or even whether or not
<br>
they are computably compressible.  (For example, one &quot;law&quot;
<br>
of chess in effect says that you cannot checkmate the
<br>
opposing King when he is defended by two Knights and you have
<br>
just a Rook, Bishop, and King in less that 322 moves in some
<br>
positions---it turns out that this is simply the case and that
<br>
there is no explanation, and that we had to use computers to 
<br>
discover this &quot;law&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking of &quot;natural laws&quot; of human behavior is no different,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really.  Human brains are connected in ways we can observe, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-level behaviors have high-level consequences we can observe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we can generalize which of those behaviors lead to results we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favor.  &quot;Natural rights&quot; is just a convenient notation, and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no more (and no less) &quot;fictional&quot; than lift or boiling points.
</em><br>
<p>The notation &quot;Natural rights&quot; is very *inconvenient* for many
<br>
reason.
<br>
<p>First, people do not mean the same thing by it at all.  Many
<br>
religious people mean something *quite* different from what
<br>
ordinary materialists could possibly mean.
<br>
<p>Second, it gets very confused with &quot;natural law&quot; as this thread
<br>
amply demonstrates.
<br>
<p>Third, semantically it would seem to allude to something that
<br>
exists in the *same* sense that laws of physics exist, e.g.,
<br>
constraints on what is possible.  But human anthropology,
<br>
much advanced over what it was in Jefferson's day, exposes
<br>
this as a complete fallacy:  we now know that insofar as
<br>
anything like individual rights are concerned, the cultural
<br>
variance is incredible.
<br>
<p>As you wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human brains are connected in ways we can observe, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-level behaviors have high-level consequences we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can observe, and we can generalize which of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors lead to results we favor.
</em><br>
<p>It all depends on time, culture, and technical sophistication.
<br>
It now appears to me that the extremely wide prevalence of
<br>
human sacrifice in almost all early societies---the Druids,
<br>
the Babylonians, the Maya, the Aztec, and, God knows, the
<br>
early Hebrews, suggests that human sacrifice might have been
<br>
a positive thing for early societies, at least in the sense
<br>
that it enabled them to prosper (more than their neighbors).
<br>
<p>So what then?  Are we to follow your reasoning and suppose
<br>
that human sacrifice is a part of natural law?  Moreover,
<br>
I guess that you've got the ultimate argument that we can
<br>
use to dispose of the socialists:  &quot;You see,&quot; we tell them,
<br>
&quot;Capitalism is just a part of natural law, resistance is
<br>
futile&quot;.
