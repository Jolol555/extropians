<p>It isn't a good point. One can be against the concept of war as a means
<br>
to resolve international problems, but not against using war to deal
<br>
with corrupt despotic dictators who refuse to operate any other way. I
<br>
think 99% of the world is against war as a means of first resort. I
<br>
also think that less than 10% is so stupid as to think that war is to
<br>
be avoided at all costs.
<br>
<p>What I would like to see is all of these anti-war protesters going to
<br>
the source of the problem: march down Saddam Boulevard in Bagdad
<br>
demanding that Saddam comply with international law. Go to Pyongyang
<br>
and lead a protest demanding that Kim Jong Il comply with international
<br>
law.
<br>
<p>Why do these pacifists not do this? Because they are at heart moral
<br>
cowards. They know that Saddam and Kim will not listen, will continue
<br>
to do what they are doing, and might even exterminate them for
<br>
protesting their actions.
<br>
<p>It's the same reason you see Ecoterrorists attacking ski resorts rather
<br>
than chemical plants, protesting western governments rather than
<br>
communist or other despotic regiemes: because they know they are not
<br>
going to wind up in a gulag or shot for doing so, and because companies
<br>
like coffee shops and ski resorts are far more sensitive about their
<br>
public image than chemical plants.
