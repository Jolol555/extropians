<p>&lt;&lt;NASA TESTS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ROCKET FUEL
<br>
<p>NASA has successfully tested an alternative rocket fuel that may increase 
<br>
operational safety and reduce costs over current solid fuels. The new 
<br>
paraffin-based fuel could eventually be used in Space Shuttle booster 
<br>
rockets.
<br>
<p>Two years of collaboration between Stanford University, Palo Alto, Calif., 
<br>
and NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., have led to the 
<br>
development of a non-toxic, easily handled fuel made from a substance similar 
<br>
to what is used in common candles. The by-products of combustion of the new 
<br>
fuel are carbon dioxide and water; unlike conventional rocket fuel that 
<br>
produces aluminum oxide and acidic gasses, such as hydrogen chloride.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is great cost in making, handling and transporting traditional solid 
<br>
rocket fuels, but the new paraffin-based fuel is less expensive, non-toxic 
<br>
and non-hazardous,&quot; said Greg Zilliac of Ames. &quot;Because the fuel is very 
<br>
stable and environmentally friendly, a hybrid rocket could be fueled at the 
<br>
launch site rather than at the factory, thereby saving money,&quot; he added. 
<br>
<p>The main goal of the NASA test program is to determine if the promising 
<br>
results of earlier bench-top experiments conducted at Stanford will scale up 
<br>
to the combustion chamber conditions required for space launch operational 
<br>
systems. &quot;The NASA combustion tests have been very promising and indicate the 
<br>
burn rate for the larger-scale apparatus is as high as that achieved in the 
<br>
small-scale Stanford tests,&quot; Zilliac continued. &quot;This new fuel could 
<br>
significantly impact the future of space transportation,&quot; he said. &gt;&gt;
