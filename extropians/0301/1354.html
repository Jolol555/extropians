<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;So far Bush is doing a very poor job convincing anybody that he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;right in attacking Irak. Especially the arab countries are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;convinced it is all just a ploy to get cheap oil. Exactly the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;turned Osama and many other arabs against the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;USA. So how can that be a long term solution?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The fact that Sadam is a murderous racist tyrant despotic dictator is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;justification enough.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;With no or little consequences and death to only him and his direct guard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and troops that *might* be enough.  But this is far from the case.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So because you feel 'innocents' might be killed, we should do nothing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sadam?  
</em><br>
<p>You should not do things that make the situation likely worse 
<br>
for the people, the region and ourselves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we can not attack IRAQ unless we only kill or remove him and his direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guard and troops.  What about his Son?  What about his supporters?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about his political leadership and infrastructure?  What about the soliders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing in his way, shall we politley ask them to step out of the way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about his aresnal?   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So now you want to eliminate all who might think like him.  Some 
<br>
&quot;democracy&quot; and free country you are attempting to set up there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The fact that Europeans do not find this as a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;justification is a testament to the liberalized moral relativist notions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;prevalent in Europe at the moment.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This is nothing but empty rhetoric.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your following response demonstates otherwise.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The latest polls show that 70% of the American people believe we should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use military means at this time, that we should give more time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspections and diplomatic means.  Of course you can make your empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accusations against them also.  But at some point you really need to notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a great deal of the world and of US people do not believe this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct course of action.  Call them whatever names you will, the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are against you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A great deal of people in the world think that thier feelings could manage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to alter the course of a single spec of dust in the universe, believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stars tell their futures, and drinking urine in the morning is healthy.
</em><br>
<p><p>Excuse me.  Are you going off on this rant in order to dismiss 
<br>
the wishes of the majority of the people when you claim to 
<br>
support democracy?  For shame!
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
<br>
<em>&gt; the numbers were also 'anti war' the vietnam era, and that cost the lives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3 million indochinese people, I must appeal to the fallacy of logic known as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argumentum ad populum, just because more people say something, doesn't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it more likely to be right.
</em><br>
<p><p>Of course not.  But in a democracy the people are supposed to 
<br>
have a very substantial voice.  How many Indochinese people did 
<br>
we ourselves kill btw?  How much of the result was made worse by 
<br>
our own actions?  These things would be difficult to evaluate 
<br>
well.  But blaming any/all bad results on those who cried for us 
<br>
to get out of Vietnam and stop the huge drain on this nation is 
<br>
obviously unbalanced and unfair argumentation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  This same majority of people (such as yourself)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think its ok that 3 million indochinese people were murdered by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansionistic communist regime.
</em><br>
<p>Boring.  I said no such thing and I am damn tired of you being 
<br>
tiresome enough to make such a silly charge.
<br>
<p>I am done with this topic.
