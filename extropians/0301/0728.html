<p>Nice timing for bringing up the gun debate. In the UK we are currently 
<br>
undergoing Yet more changes to Firearm law. This time brought about by a gang 
<br>
related multiple shooting. It would seem that the British government believe 
<br>
that increasing the age for buying Airguns from 14 to 18 will somehow prevent 
<br>
armed gangs of lawless thugs from shooting each other with 'already outlawed' 
<br>
9mm handguns.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a study has revealed that 14 to 16 year olds with bb guns are 
<br>
responsible for the majority of Firearm crimes? An amazing discovery, 
<br>
especially when taking into account that Firearm crime statistics don't 
<br>
actually include offences involving airguns.
<br>
&nbsp;See <A HREF="http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/statistics26.doc">http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/statistics26.doc</A>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really made me laugh/sick was when the shooting incident occurred 
<br>
(new years eve) the longest armed siege in UK history was going on in London. 
<br>
An armed man locked himself in a flat for 15 days and reportedly fired at 
<br>
Police on 5 different occasions. Despite this, police left his utility 
<br>
supplies ON and supplied him with KFC value meal buckets and other assorted 
<br>
take away goodies. This continued until the final days of the siege, without 
<br>
any effort by the police to remove him. It finally ended when the man set 
<br>
fire to the flat and again engaged the police with gun fire. He was hit once 
<br>
in the head but the shot failed to kill him. He then finished the job himself 
<br>
with another shot to the head. An official enquiry into the farce has been 
<br>
called for.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a quick search for suicide rates in the UK and found that you 
<br>
are nearly 100 times more likely to kill yourself than to be shot and killed 
<br>
by someone else. So watch that person in the mirror! Not only that, but I 
<br>
believe the firearm crime figures also include suicides and deaths occurring 
<br>
where the firearm was used as a blunt instrument.
<br>
<p>Stats are great, you gotta love em. 
<br>
