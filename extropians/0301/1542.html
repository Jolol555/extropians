Starving people are sad but apparently an equal problem is malnutrition which often also kills through secondary problems. Also diseases such as AIDS, TB, malaria, cholera etc..
<br>
<p>Malnutrition is allegedly now 750 million and has been declining by 100 million a decade.
<br>
<p>The immanence of initial longevity/appearance therapies means that we should now logically switch priorities to the prevention of immediate death and cancer, heart disease, respiratory ailments, neurological ailments. I have noticed that this order of priority has begun to be articulated by non-extropians/transhumanists who have heard of generic developments. It is entirely logical as outside of deliberate killing, starvation and diseases such as malaria or TB, these (cancer, heart, lung, brain-nerves) are the major causes of actual death. By the time that telomere degradation etc. becomes a problem for most people more advanced techniques will be available.

Subject: More on Doing vs. talking.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going to try and put my words into extropic &quot;action&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The GM cows article from New Scientist contained a quote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from &quot;Vanessa Atkinson&quot; of &quot;Greenpeace Australia&quot;, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The rejection of genetically engineered food is very strong, in countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like China as well as the West. And if people don't want to eat it, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one will produce it - we've seen that clearly in Europe,&quot; says Vanessa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atkinson of Greenpeace Australia. It would be important to ensure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any GM animal ingredient would be labelled, she says.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I would tend to disagree with the assertion that there is strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance to GM foods in China (we are talking about the place where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is extensive government and VC funding of stem cell research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as documented in my previous comments abstracted from publications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Nature).  Bottom line -- people who are poor or starving will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy to consume whatever satisfies their hunger pangs and keeps them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alive.  If GM foods contain more protein, are less expensive, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then can anyone *really* believe that people (other than those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been &quot;brainwashed&quot; in a religious cult perspective) would reject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consuming them?  The assertion is &quot;irrational&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [The suggestions by Vanessa do raise the question of whether much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Europe has indeed been &quot;brainwashsed&quot;.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *So*, in the vein of &quot;talk less&quot; -- &quot;do more&quot; (and I'm well aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;doing&quot; may involve &quot;talking&quot; -- I offer up this URL:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/truefood/newsdetail.asp?PRID=345">http://www.greenpeace.org.nz/truefood/newsdetail.asp?PRID=345</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which seems to contain some telephone numbers for Vanessa and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her associates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some interesting questions that pop into my mind....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - &quot;Are you aware of how many people die from starvation each year?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   The figure is staggering -- 13-18 million people each year [1]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - &quot;Have you done an analysis of how many people will starve to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    death due to more expensive food costs as a result of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    policies Greenpeace is promoting?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - &quot;Do you have any problems going to sleep at night knowing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    your activities may result in the deaths of millions of human lives?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (The last one is a bit of a stretch since it assumes the &quot;green&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective will prevail.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I'm sure you get the basic idea.  Invent your own questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Get creative.  Then call Vanessa's office or Vanessa herself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be polite.  Be &quot;reasonable&quot;.  But do not be reluctant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;raise the issues&quot;.  After all people will live or die based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on how *really* extropic we are willing to be.
