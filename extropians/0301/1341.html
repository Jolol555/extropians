In a message dated 1/24/2003 1:05:26 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Iraq:%20the%20case%20for%20decisive%20action">Spudboy100@aol.com</a> quotes Kai: &quot;War against terrorism is not comparable with 
<br>
conventional wars. It means fighting against belief systems and against the 
<br>
causes for the motivation of those people. Wars like this can not be won with 
<br>
bombs. You either win them in the minds or not at all. Therefore, the only 
<br>
intelligent idea of Mr. Bush so far has been the &quot;coalition against 
<br>
terrorism&quot;. He now is going to destroy this coalition for no sensible 
<br>
reason.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;## Of course terrorists have been whipped any number of times.  And 
<br>
before that other old stand by of pacifists is pulled out of the hat 
<br>
&quot;violence does settle things.&quot;  Hitler, Carthage, the Knights Templar and any 
<br>
number of others have not been heard from lately.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Vietnam the invisible VC slithering through the jungles unseen 
<br>
and unheard was a creation of the peaceniks and the media.  If you ever talk 
<br>
to any of the professionals you will find Charley was regarded as more of a 
<br>
city boy uncomfortable in the jungle.  After the defeat during Tet the VC was 
<br>
never heard of again.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is simple: we must not let the rhetoric of the faint hearted 
<br>
and those seeking to excuse their hiding behind others overly impress us.  
<br>
There still appears to be a good chance to be rid of Sadaam without having 
<br>
much of a war if any.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the threat he represents to the US there are good 
<br>
strategic reasons for opposing him and that is oil.  It is true that the US 
<br>
gets only a small part of its oil from that area but Europe needs to be 
<br>
protected.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai then adds this: &quot;So why isn't there an international coalition 
<br>
against proliferation, lead by the US, but instead only one focus on one of 
<br>
the most unlikely terrorist supporting countries in the world?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;## Go look in a mirror Kai.  There is no international coalition 
<br>
because you will not be a part of one.  You want the privilege of telling the 
<br>
US that we should not answer the threat to our lives from the Mideast but 
<br>
that instead you want us to go do something about North Korea.  You want 
<br>
privilege and ease without doing any of the work or taking any of the 
<br>
responsibility.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kai, &quot;The US are not going to war for moral, ethics and democracy - or 
<br>
not any 
<br>
longer. Would that be so, other countries than Iraq would be top on the list. 
<br>
Countries where people die of hunger, while a small elite sells their country 
<br>
for their own profit.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;##Still making choices for the US, Kai?  Why don't you form a 
<br>
coalition to do something about the North Koreans?  Why didn't you do 
<br>
something about Sadaam during the past ten years?  You want the boycott to 
<br>
work and you want to see his sick, elderly and children fed -- how come for 
<br>
ten years you have turned a blind eye while he spent money to build weapons?  
<br>
If you sold him food and medicines wouldn't that have been as profitable as 
<br>
selling machine tools or other supplies to build WMDs?
