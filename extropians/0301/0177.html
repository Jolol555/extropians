they idiotically insist against birth control in the poorest, starving

<p>Their position is logical in regards to the wellbeing of the superpersonal

<p>A physically disabled person, I presume. (Mentally severely disabled
<br>
persons have guardians, which decide for them). Given a known high risk I
<br>
would say that's borderline criminally negligent in regards to the child.  
<br>
It also incurs costs on the society, which in this case should be carried
<br>
by the parents (e.g. via a disability insurance) since preventable.
<br>
<p>If the parents deliberately choose to reject an available procedure which
<br>
would have resulted in a healthy child (let's say embryo screening for the
<br>
usual chromosome aberration and a library of known genetic defects)  I'd
<br>
say this crosses the line. Whose business is it? The society's. If you
<br>
mistreat your child, you can lose custody. Willingly inflict gross defects
<br>
upon a child is clearly a very serious mistreatment, since irreversible.

<em>&gt; That patterns already exist is something which doesn't come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily to even most 21st century people.  Greg Egan, in
</em><br>
<p>Patterns are information. Information doesn't exist without a material 
<br>
carrier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Permutation City&quot; raised consciousness on this topic as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so often science fiction writers are the first to do.  With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his &quot;Theory of Dust&quot;, he helps to prepare minds for the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that whether a pattern exists on in computer memory, or on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disk, or on paper cards, or in a biological organism, or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain places in intergalactic space in the form of dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles, doesn't matter a whit.  Patterns are forever.
</em><br>
<p>A pattern is meaningless in absence of an encoding and decoding system. 
<br>
The Mars face is only a face as long there are monkeys which can 
<br>
interprete that pattern as faceness.
<br>
<p>IIRC, the extreme position of the 'dust theory' is that an enumeration of
<br>
all possible patterns -- regardless of sequence of ocurrence, whether
<br>
temporal or spatial -- implements all known realities. I don't agree with
<br>
this interpretation.
<br>
<p>Even trivial sized systems cannot be enumerated fully, because systems
<br>
have a low limit on how many bits of state they can hold and how quickly
<br>
they can change. Assuming I have a specific system's evolution trajectory,
<br>
can I randomly jumble the frames, and still claim it's the same
<br>
trajectory? I don't think so. Each frame follows from another via
<br>
iterative transformation. I cannot skip frames, shortcutting terrain
<br>
inbetween without actually doing the computation work. So I can't know a 
<br>
priori whether a given jumbled trajectory is just trash, or really 
<br>
jumbled. So I have to make a computation at least once, and have a 
<br>
reference record about how the original trajectory looks like relatively 
<br>
to a given jumbled one.

<p>Right now this pattern has been distributed over multiple systems all over

the world. Integers or patterns per se don't exist in absence of

production systems encoding and representing them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which by a most transparent cipher reads

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Hello my name is Lee Corbin.  Yes I am an integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but my pattern is that of a real person existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Earth 2003 AD.  I am less than a google long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but still as you will see there is no doubt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am he.  I have his DNA, his memories, his beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and personality dispositions.  Consult the weighty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table of contents directly following...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A particular integer of this class exists as certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as does the number 17, and like 17 has many objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties.  That this integer is not as *manifest*
</em><br>
<p>No, that integer does not exist as long as you don't write it down, all of
<br>
it, or at least have given a production system allowing to reconstruct
<br>
that integer in a given shared context. Once you've scanned yourself, and
<br>
encoded that pattern into a material carrier, you can truthfully state
<br>
that number exists. Before, it's just a promise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to human intelligence as the number 17 doesn't change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should some strings such as the above get run time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not others?  More importantly, who should decide?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The answers are clear if you cast away ancient prejudices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and try to be logical.
</em><br>
<p>This is not logic, Lee. You've built your system on a set of random 
<br>
axioms. Not shared by most people. I notice you're making a pattern of 
<br>
being consistently unreasonable.
