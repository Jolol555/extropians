<em>&gt; In this instance we have a murderous racist US and west freedom hating

</em><br>
<em>&gt; support 
</em><br>
<p>It's hard to bear the drawbacks of being the self-proclaimed leader of 
<br>
the world, hm? ;-) Bad reputation normally comes from bad manners, such 
<br>
as dealing with the contras in Nicaragua, financing bin Ladins group or 
<br>
Saddam, killing democratically elected politicians in South America, 
<br>
Africa, etc. The US foreign policy has a serious problem with its self 
<br>
marketing and credibility. Even though I do not share any hatred towards 
<br>
americans (nor towards other people), I can see where the hatred comes from.
<br>
<p>And to make one thing very clear again: Saddam and his regime is one of 
<br>
the worst tyrannies currently on this planet, but it makes no sense to 
<br>
suddenly get into such a hurry that will produce more negative than 
<br>
positive effects.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; In this case a clear and present threat exists,
</em><br>
<p>Pardon, where exactly _is_ this &quot;clear and present threat&quot;? No ABC 
<br>
weapons have been found so far. The US government says to have evidence 
<br>
of them but refuses to give these informations to the UN. Why?
<br>
<p>Iraq is almost 10,000km away from New York and Washington. That's a 
<br>
roundtrip LA, Anchorage, NY, Houston, or in other words 1.2 times the 
<br>
distance between Honolulu and New York. It's far enough away, that even 
<br>
US bombers cannot reach them directly from the US, but have to use bases 
<br>
in Germany (3500km), Turkey (1200km) or Saudi-Arabia (1400km).
<br>
<p>The Iraqi military forces are no threat to the US army. Their airforce 
<br>
is almost extinct or dead metal, because the jets cannot be repaired.
<br>
<p>Even if Saddam would ever have ABC weapons, of which B and C are the 
<br>
most likely, what could he possibly do that would be a threat to the 
<br>
USA? Risking a counterstrike that would bomb his country into the stone 
<br>
age? Risking to lose his only source of wealth? Saddam knows pretty well 
<br>
what would happen to him if any kind of attack on the US, terrorist or 
<br>
not, could be traced back to him. In my opinion, that's why no 
<br>
connection between Al-Qaida and Saddam has been found yet.
<br>
<p>So, which kind of danger can a country be with almost no military power, 
<br>
with a sharply restricted economy, being under embargo for 10 years now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am all for ousting the non-democratic despotic regimes all over the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring all humans into constitutional democratic republics and all the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will benefit. 
</em><br>
<p>Wonderful. And you will find me at your side, as soon as the plan has a 
<br>
better chance to really solve problems, instead of creating new and more 
<br>
dangerous ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;And even worse: the US has no interest in such a development.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you know this howwwww....?  Creating a democratic free arab nation over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the largest sources of oil in the world will have profound benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the US.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but not for the interests of the people who currently reign your 
<br>
country. You do know, that most of the cabinet members are personal 
<br>
buddies of Bush and are closely connected with the biggest oil companies 
<br>
of Texas?
<br>
<p>I don't think, that this &quot;cartell&quot; has spend 50mio. US$ to finance a 
<br>
president just to be the benefactor of a far away country. Not even if 
<br>
it would be tax reducible. I don't think, that these folks will silently 
<br>
sit back and watch an Iraq-owned oil company rise. I personally find it 
<br>
far more plausible, that these companies will use every form of 
<br>
influence they can find, to control the Iraqi oil all by themselves.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S. You may decide on your own if you find any grain of truth in the 
<br>
following joke I found in my mailbox today...
<br>
<p>On a campaign through the US, president Bush visits a school to explain 
<br>
his foreign politics to the students. Afterwards, he askes the kids to 
<br>
ask questions. So, little Bob asks:
<br>
&quot;Mr president, I've got three questions.
<br>
1) How come that you became elected although you've lost the elections 
<br>
by numbers?
<br>
2) Why do you want to attack Iraq without a reason?
<br>
3) Don't you think that bombing Hiroshima was the biggest terrorist 
<br>
attack of all times?&quot;
<br>
<p>But before Bush can answer, the school bell rings and all children go to 
<br>
have a break.
<br>
<p>After they are back from the break, president Bush asks again for 
<br>
questions. This time little Joey asks:
<br>
&quot;Mr president, I've got five questions.
<br>
1) How come that you became elected although you've lost the elections 
<br>
by numbers?
<br>
2) Why do you want to attack Iraq without a reason?
<br>
3) Don't you think that bombing Hiroshima was the biggest terrorist 
<br>
attack of all times?
<br>
4) Why did the school bell ring 20 minutes early today and
<br>
5) Where's Bob?&quot;
