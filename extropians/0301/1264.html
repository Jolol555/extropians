Yes and natural gas in increasing in price rapidly.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>

<br>
Wouldn't these work best in the desert far away from towns and such.
<br>
It would seen that
<br>
the land in the desert in not good for much else anyway.  While it's
<br>
true that the ecology
<br>
would be destroyed somewhat, there's a lot of desert available and the
<br>
land should be cheap.
<br>
How many people are required to maintain a large wind power installation
<br>
if the site is remote?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Could the wind turbines be combined with solar technology to yield a
<br>
higher kilowatt-hour per
<br>
acre?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;What can we do as normal citizens to force the power companies to adopt
<br>
&nbsp;wind turbines at a higher rate?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Would the cost go down further if the turbines were manufactured in the
<br>
United States 
<br>
instead of Denmark?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
How much do you predict prices will be able to drop over the next 10
<br>
years?

<br>
<p><p>The cost of a kilowatt-hour of &quot;wind generated&quot; electricity has declined
<br>
from $.32 about ten years ago to about $.03 currently....and it's
<br>
continuing to drop.  Right now only natural gas is cheaper.
<br>
<p>So far I've been involved in several  projects.  One in Oregon, One in
<br>
Kansas, One in Iowa, One in Texas and one in California. By way of
<br>
example the texas one was at King Mountain near Macamey Tx. and was
<br>
about 250 megawatts.   Right now texas is second to california with over
<br>
a thousand megawatts of wind turbines....california has just shy of
<br>
twice that.
<br>
<p>For calender year 2003 I've heard that about another thousand is to be
<br>
installed nation wide.  About 250 in eastern New Mexico which I intend
<br>
to be involved.
<br>
<p>There are a number of web sites for anyone interested.  For example the
<br>
American Wind Energy Association.
<br>
<p>By the way....Denmark is the world leader in wind turbine manufacture.
<br>
That texas project i was on was entirely Danish....we hauled the whole
<br>
she-bang from Houston.   Several hundred  truckloads. (One complete
<br>
Turbine requires half a dozen or more trucks each......BIG trucks....I
<br>
was grossing over 100K lbs  with a overall  length in excess of 120 ft.)
<br>
<p>Naturally I'm in favor of Wind Turbines.  I'm making money off 'em.
<br>
<p>Some are not.....for the oddest reasons too. (birds run into
<br>
them...theyre ugly...they only work when the wind blows....they
<br>
interrupt the peace and tranquility of the desert scorpion...)
<br>
<p>I figure everything has advantages and disadvantages.  If a wind farm
<br>
only produces  18 hours a day in West Texas (or 12....or 10...while the
<br>
wind is blowing)....then that means a coal fired plant down the road
<br>
(with coal imported by train from wyoming)....can be run at a lower
<br>
capacity and pollute less. (and the locomotives....NOT using low sulphur
<br>
diesel....will also pollute less)
<br>
<p>I'll sacrafice a few burds for that.....
