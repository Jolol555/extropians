<p>I'm interested in what Lee has to say too!  I just wish he'd been
<br>
a bit more considerate about *where* he said it.
<br>
<p>He combined comments on multiple threads into one thread.
<br>
<p>Such a practice muddies up the thread in which its posted and any
<br>
follow-up posts on Lee's comments from other posters end up 
<br>
cross-threaded. Thats inefficient as well as discourteous.
<br>
<p>I hope we can have *both* the benefits of Lee's insight and the
<br>
higher efficiency that comes with generally applied courtesy. 
<br>
<p>I reckon we can. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  not because I have a unique 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest in the particular quarks making up his physical system, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because quarks organized in a Lee Corbinish way seem to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the more interesting and logical statements appearing on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians list.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. 
<br>

<p><em>&gt; &gt; PS:   If anyone thinks *I* am out of line here please advise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me offlist. -  Thank you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Er, no.  You posted onlist, I'm replying onlist.
</em><br>
<p>Ok. That's fair enough too. 
<br>
<p>But now, I ask you Eliezer, on list, for clarification. 
<br>
<p>As a *general rule*, can't we expect to have *both* the benefits
<br>
of *any* poster's insights and the courtesy and efficiency of their
<br>
placing their thoughts in the thread to which they relate?
