<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike Lorrey beautifully explains

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oil prices in a free Iraq world would be around $10/bbl.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They are currently around $30/bbl, partly due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restriction on Iraqi oil exports, partly on the Venezuelan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; civil conflict (which can also be traced to left wing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; organizations), and partly on global uncertainty over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future US actions in Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike/Lee I simply cannot accept this premise (sorry).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have to assume that (a) the U.S. (or Europe) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act to pump-up-the volume with respect to Iraqi oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production (and there is no useful knowledge with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to the degree they could do that given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade of decay in the production capabilities) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the (b) the Saudis (or other OPEC or even non-OPEC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members) would not act in a way to offset the production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase that Iraq *might* be able to achieve.
</em><br>
<p>If the Saudis offset production (keep in mind that Iraq has the second
<br>
largest reserves) in Iraq by reducing their own production, they will
<br>
stifle their ability to finance repression at home and terrorism abroad
<br>
(i.e. Palestine as well as al Qaeda). Their government might even fall
<br>
(a win win situation for us if a democratic Iraq is established).
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that every time in the past, prior to the Gulf War, that
<br>
the Saudis attempted various ways of stifling production to keep prices
<br>
up, they failed, simply because there is more natural supply than there
<br>
is demand. All oil prices that exist and have existed since the late
<br>
1960's are not natural prices, they are the result of governments
<br>
attempting to restrict production below natural market stimulated
<br>
levels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The price of oil is subject to a complex &quot;present value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis&quot; of both the countries producing it and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumers.  It comes down to a question of &quot;do I gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more by pumping the oil or leaving it in the ground?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>This is ostensibly what it *should* be, but significant political
<br>
considerations come into play as well, as well as the fact that the
<br>
self interest of many oil producers is never congruent, especially in a
<br>
world where consumers have demonstrated and ability to utilize
<br>
technology to conserve energy and restrict consumption. Since the
<br>
mid-80's, oil producers have been fighting over a smaller and smaller
<br>
pie while their own constituencies have demanded more revinues, ergo
<br>
higher production rates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, there are disruptions, e.g. Venezuela or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pipelines being blown up (or not built due to political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems), etc.  But you are living in a fantasy world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you think most oil producing nations are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pump oil at $10/bbl).  They *know* the supply will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually decline.  They are also in primarily state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run companies that are not subject to the quarterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictates of Wall Street.  So their focus is on &quot;how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do I preserve my job?&quot;.  And that is very dfferent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in each political situation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't suppose anybody recalls the rampant quota cheating done by ALL
<br>
oil producers whenever Saudi Arabia tried to corral those cats into
<br>
lockstep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I would suggest that if you think every oil minister
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will continue to do exactly what they are doing now if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq bumps its production from say 2M to 4M BBL (these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are hypothetical numbers which one would need to verify)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you are living in fantasy land.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. Keep in mind that Venezuela is only producing about a
<br>
third of its pre-strike levels of 2 million bbls. Iraq is producing
<br>
less than a quarter of its capacity. Russia has brought previously
<br>
untapped reserves on line in the last year, so if Venezuela and Iraq
<br>
get straightened out, their combined production levels will bankrupt
<br>
Saudi Arabias ability to control prices. Saudis may be able to
<br>
stabilize oil prices because of their vast capacity and reserves, but
<br>
they would bankrupt themselves in the process.
<br>
<p>If we bring ANWR on line in the same time frame, oil markets will no
<br>
longer be seller dominated.
