On another list I read:
<br>
<p>In the recent presentation by Steve Austad at Kass' bioethics commission
<br>
meeting, he presented information on new research in which someone has been
<br>
able to increase the lifespan of mice by 50% through a new mitrochondrial
<br>
antioxidant gene manipulation (see quote below):
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------------
<br>
S. Austad Talk at Commission on Bioethics
<br>
Let me just give one unpublished example of a gene that I think is the sort
<br>
of thing that we're going to see more and more of. This is one of the few
<br>
genes, like I say, they're just a handful and increased longevity comes from
<br>
an enhancement of a normal gene product, so this is a mouse that's been
<br>
genetically engineered to over-produce a cellular anti-oxidant. Anti-oxidant
<br>
called catalase. What makes it unique is that it's been directed. It usually
<br>
is active in one part of the cell, it's been redirected to another part of
<br>
the cell, this part of the cell that produces most of the oxygen radicals.
<br>
And when you do that, we now have the first mammal ever where increased
<br>
anti-oxidant activity increases longevity. There haven't been a lot of
<br>
functional studies. We don't know if it's just longevity, or if it's a
<br>
generalized retardation of aging, but we do know from looking at the animals
<br>
that died, that the sorts of normal mouse heart pathology has decreased in
<br>
these animals.
<br>
DR. FOSTER: Just one quick technical question. In the unpublished experiment
<br>
on the catalase activation and the expression other than its normal
<br>
expression, was that to move it into mitochondria for the electron
<br>
transport?
<br>
DR. AUSTAD: Yes.
