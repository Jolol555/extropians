<a href="mailto:kmb@kai-m-becker.de?Subject=Re:%20Machiavelli%20(Was:%20Iraq)">kmb@kai-m-becker.de</a> writes: Even in the 80s, everone knew that Taliban and 
<br>
Mujaheddin were religious fundamentalists who would never follow western 
<br>
values, but could easily convert into the same West-hating breed that ruled 
<br>
Iran at that time. And US intelligence knew pretty well that Saddam has 
<br>
always been a ruthless dictator.  I just want to point out that supporting 
<br>
groups with a high probability of becoming future enemies is not a wise 
<br>
strategy. An even more unwise strategy is to support bad guy A against bad 
<br>
guy B, then fear A getting to strong and support bad guy C against A. That's 
<br>
a straight line to the Goedel number of foreign policy.
<br>
<p>Kia,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds great.  Unfortunately it ignores what we were doing.  Put 
<br>
simply we were helping them against the Soviet Union or against another enemy 
<br>
that was even worse than these folks turned out to be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Al Qaeda killed about 3000 people here but we helped them against 
<br>
the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union has in the past been a far worse group 
<br>
than the Al Qaeda has ever managed to be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadaam we helped against the Iranians.  The Iranians had simply 
<br>
captured the contents of our embassy contrary to every international law.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you grab evidence that you can twist to your conclusions 
<br>
without ever considering that evidence in its entirety.
