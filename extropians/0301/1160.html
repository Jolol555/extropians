</em><br>

<em>&gt; Well, I'd still take out the word &quot;formal&quot;.  My whole point

</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic.  
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure you'll agree that mathematics of any kind is properly defined
<br>
as a type of &quot;formal&quot; logic (if not, then I have no idea what you mean
<br>
by &quot;formal&quot;). 
<br>
<p>And, as the saying goes, &quot;Mathematics is the hand-maiden of science.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider Darwin's work alone:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceedingly empirical, but so far as I know, entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without mathematics.  And he's considered by many, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, to be the greatest scientist of all time.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt very much that Darwin could have arrived at his theory without
<br>
an understanding of formal mathematics, even if only of simple
<br>
arithmetic. 
<br>
<p>I admit however that Darwin is an interesting case. You may realize that
<br>
your argument here with respect to Darwin is related to one of the
<br>
arguments trotted out by creationists: that biological macro-evolution
<br>
is not a proper scientific theory in that it has never been observed or
<br>
quantified in any empirical way. Micro-evolution (concerning variations
<br>
within a species) is a proper scientific theory, they say, but
<br>
macro-evolution (concerning the origin of species) is not.
<br>
<p>However, after Mendel, I think it is wrong to state that the modern
<br>
theory of evolution does not depend on formal mathematical logic. Among
<br>
other things, we predict the appearance of genetic traits in formal
<br>
statistical terms. 
<br>
<p>Einstein's statement is, after all, about the *development* of western
<br>
science, (as opposed to the origins of scientific insight). In this
<br>
respect Einstein was correct even if you are correct about Darwin. The
<br>
*development* of the theory of biological evolution has depended heavily
<br>
on mathematics.
<br>
<p>Einstein's own theory of relativity was conceived intuitively, without
<br>
formal mathematics, but it was only via the formal logic (pure
<br>
mathematics) of Lorentz that his theory could be developed and
<br>
communicated. Imagine Einstein trying to explain relativity to his peers
<br>
without recourse to formal mathematics!
