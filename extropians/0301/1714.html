<em>&gt; &gt; When they think we'll look out for own interests without consideration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of anyone else, yes, that is frightening.  We have words for people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think only about their own interests and have much more power than others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Sociopaths&quot;.  &quot;Brutal dictators&quot;.  &quot;Saddam Hussein&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; George Bush through his staff and cabinet officers have been talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to everyone on the face of the globe.  Even while in the middle of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this threat they have had time to notice what is going on in Africa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the Aids epidemic, to chart a course and report to our country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we should participate in the response to that epidemic in a big way.
</em><br>
<p>The deeper question is why.  The only degree to which human nature
<br>
appears to have changed in the last 40,000 years is that memes and
<br>
traditions have changed.  One hundred years ago Great Britain did
<br>
pretty much as it pleased in the Middle East or anywhere else.
<br>
If it paid any attention to what anyone else thought, e.g. France,
<br>
then it was only because the French were probably after exploiting
<br>
the same resource, and it might be necessary to &quot;share&quot; to avoid
<br>
hostilities.
<br>
<p>The only possible explanation is that the motives of the governments
<br>
in power have changed.  Why did the British Empire seek to abolish
<br>
slavery?  What was their economic motivation?  So far as I know, it
<br>
was merely that they wished to appease public opinion, so as to 
<br>
increase the chance that their party remained in power.  This is
<br>
the only mechanism I know of whereby the moral inhibitions of every-
<br>
day people begin to affect national policy.  (Well, that's a minor
<br>
exaggeration---rulers have always used ethnic hatred and national
<br>
envy to their in pursuit of their national goals.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        So how can you respond in the fashion you just have?  If you didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intend that comment to apply to the US you sure haven't indicated so.  If you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did intend for your comment to apply to the US you certainly haven't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified your position given what we see happening in the real world.  Uncle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sugar is still right out there listening to people, helping when he can and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full of good will at all times.
</em><br>
<p>At all times?  ;-)  Well, we mustn't exaggerate.  If in my earlier lists
<br>
of the possible motivations of an American administration
<br>
<p>(A) getting re-elected
<br>
(B) increasing U.S. prestige and power
<br>
(C) making the Democrats look bad
<br>
(D) the reasons 1-6 on the [next] list
<br>
<p>are accurate, then in addition to my list of reasons to
<br>
attack Iraq (below) we could see via (A) and (B) that
<br>
helping out African AIDS victims would also be highly
<br>
motivated as well.  This only slightly resembles your
<br>
characterization of &quot;being full of good will at all
<br>
times&quot;, which more properly describes a person, not
<br>
a nation, and only certain people at that.
<br>
<p>But the above *motives* can lead to actions and effects
<br>
that some people on this list approve of.
<br>
<p>(1) non-proliferation of WMD
<br>
(2) diminishing support for terrorists
<br>
(3) breaking monopolistic control of oil
<br>
(4) punishing the abrogation of treaties and agreements
<br>
(5) giving the evil and murderous Iraqi regime what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it richly deserves
<br>
(6) instilling fear in small dictatorships in general, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also respect for the West's values on human rights
<br>
