<p>
There is very good reason to believe that Saddam Hussein was in contact with
<br>
the American embassy in Cairo when he was in exile. This is not strange,
<br>
because alliances of convenience were taking place every day. And the United
<br>
States was afraid that Iraq, under Kassem, might be going communist. So was
<br>
the Ba'ath Party. So they had a common enemy, a common target--the
<br>
possibility of a communist take-over of Iraq. So there is a record of Saddam
<br>
visiting the American embassy frequently, and there is a record of the
<br>
Egyptian security people telling him not to do that. However, one must
<br>
remember that at that time, Saddam was a minor official of the Ba'ath Party.
<br>
He was not terribly important. And he was really following in the footsteps
<br>
of other people who are much more important.
