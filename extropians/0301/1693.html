<p>
<em>&gt;&gt; But if all they do is speak, all I can do is speak in return,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and hope that humans with reasonable minds judge us both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reasonably.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, lies can become rumors, which can become &quot;common 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge&quot;, which then lead to actions. Like &quot;if vietnam falls, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communists will invade the US&quot;. Or &quot;if the amis come here, they'll rape 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all german women&quot;. Or &quot;Saddam has WMDs&quot;, rsp. &quot;Saddam is really dangerous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for us&quot;. See the book &quot;The Wave&quot; for an example, how fabricated &quot;truth&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can influence reality.
</em><br>
<p>When, and only when, it rises to action can one morally act, other than
<br>
to speak in return; otherwise you fall into the same counterproductive
<br>
idiotic authoritarian nonsense as attempts to prevent drug abuse by
<br>
banning needles or stop gangs by banning leather jackets, or stop
<br>
violence by banning toy guns.  Yes, I have no doubt that lies can lead
<br>
to behaviors, and I'll even concede that there's one entity--the
<br>
government itself--whose speech /should/ be regulated, but that's not
<br>
contradictory at all to my contention that free speech is a fundamental
<br>
human right, because governments don't have human rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Your contention that any kind of speech must be supressed
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Ah, waitaminute. I said &quot;unlimited lying&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, speech.  Lying is speech.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This term contains two words. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first means &quot;without any restrictions or boundaries&quot;, the second 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means &quot;distribution of untrue allegations&quot; :-) Together, it means, I'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to have a way to stop _only_ the unrestricted distribution of untrue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements about my person.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's exactly what I'm accusing you of--wanting to supress
<br>
false speech about yourself with force, rather than with competition.
<br>
We're both in total agreement here about what you and I are suggesting,
<br>
we just don't approve of each other's suggestions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't live in an ideal, rational world. People do judge by rumors and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation, which is almost never true, objective or rational. You, for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, judge me -whatwasit- to be &quot;left-wing&quot;, &quot;anti-american&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;naive&quot;, etc. without any knowledge about me but the few words I've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written here. 
</em><br>
<p>That's true too, and you are free to call me on it, and I'm sure there
<br>
are others here and elsewhere who disagree.  You can only be harmed by
<br>
my evaluation of you in the minds of those who already give me more
<br>
credibility, in which case the harm is already done anyway.  Likewise,
<br>
you can only damage my reputation among those who prefer to believe you,
<br>
and I am generally unconcerned about how I am perceived by them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Example: &quot;Lee Daniel Crocker is a child molestor. Protect your kids,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force him out of this town&quot;. What would your defense be? Ask for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidences? Have you ever seen a witch-hunt? Remember McCarthy? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we remember McCarthy well.  What we learned was to not to hang
<br>
witch-hunters instead of witches--what we learned is to recognize
<br>
with-hunts for what they are and better use our own judgment.  It
<br>
wasn't new laws that took down McCarthy, it was good reporting by
<br>
men of integrity and courage like Edward R. Murrow.
