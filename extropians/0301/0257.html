<p><em>&gt;&gt; I think you may have taken this post too seriously, Brett.

<p><em>&gt;Maybe. I do that sometimes : ).

__________
<br>
<p>A typical human occurrence :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sometimes it is our critics that can give us valuable information

about where our messages are failing to get through or are being
<br>
misunderstood.&lt;

<br>
<p>Was this ever doubted?  I mean you are talking to an artist and what we do
<br>
is critique, critique, and critique.  It's our nature.  Perhaps criticism
<br>
is something you are currently dealing with in your work/life, but for me
<br>
it’s already integrated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My current approach to things is probably a bit hyper-political
</em><br>
because of what I've been doing over much of the last year as
<br>
a lobbyist working with pro-biotech and stem cell industry groups
<br>
and patient advocacy groups to try and get the best possible
<br>
legislative environment in Australia for stem cell research.&lt;
<br>
___________
<br>
<p>I think this is good.  I'm glad that someone is right in the thick of
<br>
things and can offer valuable information about policies on the floor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sorry I'm not familiar with Pro-Act.&lt;
</em><br>
______________
<br>
<p>It’s a network I created before my cancer surgery, when it was put on hold
<br>
(but definitely not forgotten).  You can go to
<br>
<a href="http://www.progressaction.org/">http://www.progressaction.org/</a> and see the talk I delivered at Extro 5 and
<br>
the PowerPoint presentation.  The mission statement on the home page.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But just this
</em><br>
morning Australian time, I looked at a number of other threads 
<br>
posted by list members and thought this stuff is great. The quality
<br>
of the content is very high. This is NOT a group in danger of being
<br>
swamped by negativity in my view.&lt;
<br>
______________
<br>
<p>I agree with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In my experience many people and groups find it exceptionally
</em><br>
difficult to really hear criticism and therefor to benefit from it.&lt;
<br>
____________________
<br>
<p>I'm not sure about this, but I do now that in the art world, criticism is
<br>
expected and utilized.  Art critics are in high demand and studio artists
<br>
(painters and electronic artists) rely on criticism for our work. It is how
<br>
we are taught to cogitate and conjecture.
<br>
<p>On a more objective stance, I think extropians are similarly interested in
<br>
criticism for their/our growth and also, importantly, for our reliability. 
<br>
We need those who are knowledgeable to catch any mistakes we make and
<br>
offer/suggest new or better ways of approaching a subject.
<br>
<p>But, I do agree that there are many people, including extropians, who react
<br>
defensively and I'm sure we all bear that burden at some point or another. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It really is hard work to start organizations and promote lists and
</em><br>
to actually be a positive political force for positive change. The folk
<br>
that do it, do it because they love it, they find reward in it. And that
<br>
is good (I'm talking generally here not about ExI). But often, and I
<br>
have had quite a bit of experience with this, the folk that do most
<br>
of the work of maintaining a vehicle or a brand or a forum become
<br>
protective of what they have built (again still quite normal, natural
<br>
and healthy). But then sometimes the protectiveness goes to far
<br>
they censor too much. They fear too much that their much loved
<br>
vehicle and all their work will be wasted if others, especially the
<br>
&quot;wrong sort&quot; of others, start to use it as a personal platform, and
<br>
&nbsp;the others are not courteous or respectful, or they may even be
<br>
opportunistic, stupid, blatantly self-serving and exploitative. In my
<br>
experience (and drawing also on my interest in psychology and
<br>
politics) good organisations, frequently do lose the plot at some 
<br>
stage, they lose some of their vitality, perhaps morphing into too
<br>
much a platform for just one or two peoples views. They start to
<br>
go into a downward spiral, that is very hard to check as the very
<br>
process of checking can itself foster problems. I think some 
<br>
others recognize this general organisational phenomenon too.&lt;
<br>
_____________
<br>
<p>Insightful observations.  I think Max is not overly protective - a darn
<br>
good thing.  But, even here he is fully aware of people who position ExI
<br>
inappropriately or misuse transhumanism for personal gain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now I *am* switching over to talking about ExI, the list and my
</em><br>
perception of your role in it.&lt;
<br>
____________
<br>
<p>I may have projected too much protectiveness onto you as 
<br>
one who I perceived to be strongly invested in the establishment
<br>
and supporting of ExI and this excellent list. I may have mistakenly
<br>
thought that you were more anxious and concerned about the 
<br>
vitality of ExI and this list than you are. If so I am both sorry
<br>
and pleased. Sorry if I misprojected and pleased if my concern
<br>
was misplaced.&lt;
<br>
_______________
<br>
<p>Yes, you are correct.  I'm a woman and it's one of my innate tendencies.:-)
<br>
My only concern with this list has been over the many years to diffuse the
<br>
boy's club mentality and to also wrongful claims made by some people that
<br>
ExI is a political organization, which it is NOT and claims no particular
<br>
affiliation with ANY one political mindset, platform or organization.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The purpose of that above comment was for me to let it be known
</em><br>
that I respect the sensitivities of those who have invested much in
<br>
setting up and maintaining a group like this. Maybe I'm respecting
<br>
sensitivities that are not so much real as imagined :-). But in any case,
<br>
if any of the group of people who I perceive are most likely to be
<br>
watchful of the health of the list, of its content and its fluctuations - 
<br>
the committee I presumed, were concerned that my posts were
<br>
becoming too negative or being perceived as too negative then I
<br>
was giving notice that I would be receptive and respond positively
<br>
to any advice about such concerns *if* they arose, though I hoped
<br>
they wouldn't.&lt;
<br>
______________
<br>
<p>Your contentiousness is appreciated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Thank you : )  Accepted and reciprocated.&lt;
</em><br>

<br>
<p>You are welcome,
