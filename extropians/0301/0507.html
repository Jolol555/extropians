<p><em>&gt; &gt; Firstly, however, I note that your paragraph mentions nothing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the law---it's as if we are in some lawless space colonies, and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are only interested in examining what we *approve* of.  But intervention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is often an entirely different matter!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The law is an abstraction built up from the approvals and disapprovals of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals, including approval and disapproval of the particular class of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions known as interventions.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, no.  The law for the most part is not built up in
<br>
this way.  It arises evolutionarily over the course of a
<br>
civilization's existence.  Often laws will arise that can't
<br>
be easily explained except as &quot;this is how it has always
<br>
been done&quot;, or &quot;stupid law, but unfortunately it's rather
<br>
built-in now&quot;.  Sometimes these laws indeed have outlived
<br>
their purpose, but often they work in a subtle way that is
<br>
not obvious to anyone, even though people will, of course,
<br>
fabricate rationalizations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Even if &quot;Is it my business?&quot; and &quot;Is it BAD?&quot; are different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;intuitions, what is it that makes one more interesting than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Simply put, it's all about intervention, as you say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Specifically, intervening in cases where it is none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the law's business.  For example, were they brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; back to life suddenly, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would look at you incredulously were one to suggest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the government regulate whether you could burn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a flag or a cross on your own premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um... nice recursion there, but you still haven't answered why your own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;intervening in this case is none of the law's business&quot; is in any wise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more interesting than a libertarian's &quot;intervening in this case is BAD&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor indeed why they are not equivalent viewpoints.
</em><br>
<p>Amazing that we are not communicating better here ;-)
<br>
Now you are specifying that it is a *libertarian's*
<br>
judgment about intervention.  Indeed, for a libertarian
<br>
to make such a judgment does happen to coincide a lot
<br>
with what is or is not someone's business.  But you
<br>
began by asking how people answer their own question
<br>
when they say &quot;Is it BAD?&quot;.  Such a question brings
<br>
into immediate play what one approves of and what one
<br>
does not.
<br>
<p>There are millions of examples where something is none
<br>
of my business, and interference inconceivable, which
<br>
are nonetheless very BAD in my opinion.  Abortion and
<br>
infanticide are two such examples, but even such mundane
<br>
cases as adultery and lying come to mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I suspect that whenever acting &quot;just for someone's own good,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether they realize it or not&quot;, gets problematical beyond belief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it gets very problematical very fast.  It is still a problem that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot avoid confronting where babies are involved.  Perhaps you confuse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;acting for the good of an incomplete mind which lacks the cognitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability to realize X&quot; with &quot;claiming to act 'for the good of' a fully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adult entity who is actively objecting to it&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I admit that the answer, to me, is the same, but not
<br>
just because it becomes so problematical.  The babushkas
<br>
still stop you on the streets of Moscow, I take it, if you
<br>
don't have your baby properly bundled up by their standards.
<br>
But that's probably just a part of Russian culture by now ;-)
<br>
<p>It's very easy in most cases to determine whether or
<br>
not something is my affair.  It's harder when as a
<br>
legislator---or as a citizen giving advice to legislators
<br>
or propping up memes I favor---to try to draw the correct
<br>
bounds of modularity.  For some purposes, the apparent
<br>
modular unit is the family; sometimes it's &quot;woman with 
<br>
child&quot; (a sort of family).  At other times the efficient
<br>
way to draw boundaries between modules is at the community
<br>
level, e.g., whose business is it if some small town 
<br>
somewhere wishes to outlaw prostitution?  Only the citizens,
<br>
say I.  (I hope that at this point no one says, &quot;Oh yeah?
<br>
What if they decide to suspend habeas corpus or deny
<br>
religious freedom?&quot;)   &lt;lecture on success of nations
<br>
supporting constitutional rights suppressed for brevity&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No.  How the laws are written, and hence who the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will side with, cannot be settled by moral argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The far less idealistic approach, which has been shown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be vastly more workable, has been to observe in what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ways successful societies seem to maximize benefit and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prosperity by having enormous regard for individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizen legal rights, and enormous regard for private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property.  To be sure, as Hayek explains, we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be open to new experiments and ideas, however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maximize benefit and prosperity for what class of entities?  If you aren't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counting babies and simulations in the tally, then your assessment of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;works&quot; is based on a quite different metric for workingness.  I'm sure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if you don't count slaves as people, then slaveowning societies can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be shown to maximize benefit and prosperity (for slaveowners) by having 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormous regard for &quot;private property&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Good question!  Now it so happens that slave-owning societies
<br>
are not competitive, but let's consider a more challenging
<br>
example to my (and maybe your) world-view.  In the 1950s, 1960s,
<br>
and 1970s, a lot of great economists, like Samuelson, believed
<br>
that the Soviet economic model was more productive than Western
<br>
capitalism.  In retrospect, this seems very foolish, but for 
<br>
those of us alive then it appeared plausible.  The question then
<br>
could become---say if indeed the Soviet Union had truly begun to
<br>
supersede the West---might we not have to adopt some of their
<br>
totalitarian methods if we want to remain competitive?  The answer
<br>
could well have been &quot;yes&quot;.
<br>
<p>But that just makes my point!  Non-functioning societies or uncompetitive
<br>
ones aren't admissible to the discussion.
<br>
<p>So historically we are brought to this:  extreme regard for
<br>
private property and individual legal rights works, and not
<br>
coincidentally provides the said entities of the time with
<br>
maximal benefit and prosperity.  But the challenging question
<br>
is about the future, which I know concerns you and should 
<br>
concern all of us.
<br>
<p>What are we to do?  Re-design everything from scratch?  Sit
<br>
back and consult our infallible intuitions and reasoning
<br>
ability the way Lenin did?  Or are we to tread gingerly and
<br>
try to carefully extend what works?
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I happen to believe---in case you are wondering---
<br>
that continuing to provide the greatest respect for private
<br>
property and individual legal rights benefits the greatest
<br>
possible number of future sentients, whether we are talking
<br>
about babies or simulations.  So when I write &quot;individual
<br>
rights&quot;, I am right back to the question you asked above:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maximize benefit and prosperity for what class of entities?
</em><br>
<p>In our evolutionary approach, I suggest that we begin with
<br>
what we have.  So right now, I can legally write any kind of
<br>
screen-saver I want provided that it does not threaten anyone
<br>
else.  (YOUR big screen-saver, the SysOp, is much more of a
<br>
threat to others than mine!  ;-)  But I still wish you the
<br>
greatest possible speed and success, because I am afraid of
<br>
the alternatives.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;I am just as much against ownership of a simulation as I would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;against the claim that you &quot;owned&quot; the proteins making up a sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;you claimed was your &quot;slave&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And one can see how it comes down to a difference in how societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of equals should function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it comes down to a difference in who we consider an &quot;equal&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly right.
<br>
<p>Don't you feel lucky that there is such a clear distinction between
<br>
humans and other primates, and other mammals?  As much as PETA might
<br>
want to award citizenship to numerous other classes of creatures, it's
<br>
not practical.  So we allow humans to own other animals (and children,
<br>
up to a point).
<br>
<p>So this is where we are, as we march into the unknown.  I'll discuss
<br>
the problem---practical for you, but not for me yet---of simulatees
<br>
in another post.
