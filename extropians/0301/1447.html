recherchetenet asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;could you supply any links to articles or historical
<br>
documents of atheists' intolerant actions done in the
<br>
name of atheism (as opposed to being an atheist and
<br>
being intolerant due to some other, perhaps
<br>
quasi-religious political cause)?  And are you here
<br>
considering intolerance of the source of persecution
<br>
in this.  Obviously most of us are intolerant of those
<br>
who opinions are such as revoking freedoms in the name
<br>
of nothing other than dogma or their culture. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Hmm, you are phrasing your question, in a fashion to eliminate the Soviets, 
<br>
the Maoists, the Khmer Rouge, The North Vietnamese, the North Koreans, and so 
<br>
forth, from consideration. Bad Show!
<br>
<p>The barbarities and oppression practiced by such regimes was stated as part 
<br>
and parcel to eliminate superstitions that were holding the workers of the 
<br>
world back; and antithetical to socialism. 
<br>
<p>Someone defending the Church against charges that they promoted the tortures 
<br>
and murders of Torquemada might ask: Can you supply any link to historical 
<br>
documents that might suggest that the Fathers of the Church specifically 
<br>
ordered the execution of innocents?   The catch is nobody in the Church would 
<br>
claim that the victims were innocent. That is-nobody at the time would've :-)
<br>
<p>Atheism was and is part and parcel of the mentality of the People's Republic 
<br>
of China, today; and the primary reason they have attacked and arrested that 
<br>
silly (whatever is its name) cult.
<br>
<p>If you are contending that Atheists are incapable of doing evil, it reminds 
<br>
me of the verbiage I get from Christians, when I opine, during discussions; 
<br>
about certain atrocities done in Jesus' name. I get the spiel: Oh, those 
<br>
weren't really Christians!&quot; I sometimes reply, &quot;Well who were they then, 
<br>
Martians, Eskimo's?&quot;  
<br>
<p>I think one has to accept the evil one's groups behavior that has been done, 
<br>
once it has been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt. Its like a bad marriage, 
<br>
one either stays in it for the good it may offer, or one gets out.
<br>
<p>Please don't say: &quot;oh those weren't really atheists who committed murders 
<br>
under the banner of Communism, those were socialist.&quot; Or they were from Mars, 
<br>
mayhaps? :^)
