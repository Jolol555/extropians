<p><em>&gt; &gt; Machiavelli was possible in his times, and even then, the methods he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; described caused a lot of suffering. BTW, he was totally undemocratic and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have given nothing for human rights. He therefore cannot be a role 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; model for modern politics in an interdependent world. Instead, we have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to make sure that his followers have no chance to come to power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While his name has become synonymous with ruthless realpolitik,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was actually an idealist seeking to create a free, united and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (for its time) democratic Italy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _The Prince_ was an attempt to write a HOWTO-manual for rulers, showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what methods had worked and not worked in the past and explanations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why. For its time it was an amazing document, since it attempted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish political science as the study of what people do or can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the study of what they *ought* to do - all previous books in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genre were essentially sermons about being a nice just ruler.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, all the previous pious advice was without practical effect
<br>
at all.  Today, at least you'd have a (tiny) chance of affecting
<br>
public sentiment due to much improved distribution of information.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In his _Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Livius_ (1513-21), often called _The Republic_,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he looked at republics and what made *them* work.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't know that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In &quot;Discourses&quot; he emphasized that for a republic to survive, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to foster a spirit of patriotism and civic virtue among its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I believe that he suggested means by which rulers
<br>
could attempt to inculcate such values in the citizenry.
<br>
Of course, this is a monumental task, trying to affect
<br>
at all the basic predispositions of the citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Blaming him for ruthless politicians is a misattribution -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they existed long before and independently of his thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many of his political views don't resonate well these days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... but we shouldn't get trapped in historicism.
</em><br>
<p>My favorite Machiavelli trick was how a ruler could solve
<br>
a frequent 15th century problem.  You have just conquered
<br>
a new town, and many of the residents are chaffing under
<br>
your rule.  You know that as soon as your army is engaged
<br>
elsewhere, a revolt is certain to break out, perhaps involve
<br>
your other enemies, and that will end up posing a real threat
<br>
to your city.  What to do?
<br>
<p>You can't just round up and execute all the town's probable
<br>
troublemakers, because of the undying hatred for your rule
<br>
that will ensue.  For each prominent rebel you execute, two
<br>
who are not presently against you will rise up.
<br>
<p>Machiavelli pointed out that you should appoint a governor
<br>
of the city, one of your men who you know is inclined to
<br>
drastic solutions.  Privately, you even tell him that you
<br>
will totally back his &quot;taking care&quot; of the problem.  After
<br>
he has rounded up and killed all the potential leaders of
<br>
a revolt, you &quot;hear about&quot; the atrocities and make a personal
<br>
and loudly publicized visit to the town, and conduct an
<br>
&quot;investigation&quot;.  You express your horror and outrage at
<br>
the conduct of your governor, and have him promptly and
<br>
publicly executed.  You then ask the town its forbearance
<br>
and assure them that so long as you remain their ruler, no
<br>
further atrocities of this kind will ever be permitted.
<br>
<p>It would be extremely difficult for most of the readers of
<br>
this list, certainly including me, to look a trusting 
<br>
subordinate right in the eye and lie like that, planning
<br>
his death, and using him as a pawn.  And though most modern
<br>
Western politicians, of course, cannot ultimately do anything
<br>
so drastic to a follower, they can lie with perfect self-
<br>
assurance, and use without remorse all but their closest
<br>
friends as pawns.  Clinton was guilty in one notorious case
<br>
of making a solemn deal with the Republicans, who I guess
<br>
committed themselves somehow (perhaps publicly), and
<br>
ten minutes later going on national TV and totally betraying
<br>
the agreement.  Do you have any doubt that most of our
<br>
politicians and statesmen are capable of anything less?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He was an important step forward, and I actually prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the politician who has read his books (*all of them*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to somebody who proudly declares himself to be anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Machiavellian. 
</em><br>
<p>That's for sure.  That latter politician is no doubt
<br>
just posturing.  I recall Clinton announcing at the
<br>
outset of his presidency that it was to be the &quot;most
<br>
ethical administration ever&quot;.  The utterance of such
<br>
grandiose statements in itself is becoming a giveaway.
