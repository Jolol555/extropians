<p>Is that the best you can do to answer the questions?  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the entire arena of creating and bringing up new human or AI lives is,

</em><br>
<p>Nah.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I prefer that we do our best to be nice. I never promoted &quot;forbidd[ing]&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Correct.  In fact, you made it clear in your earlier post
<br>
that you were not for relinquishment of the idea.  As for
<br>
&quot;intolerable complexity&quot;, I don't happen to find it so.
<br>
Now &quot;the nature of consciousness&quot;, &quot;the two envelopes problem&quot;,
<br>
and the dismal science I find incredibly---but not intolerably
<br>
---complex.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Edward de Bono has famously said &quot;Critical thinking is cheap thinking.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lots of rhetoric, including pop-up Socratic dialogs, seems cheap to me, too.
</em><br>
<p>Socratic dialogues, especially those written by Plato, aren't
<br>
what I'd call cheap, but each to his own taste.  As for critical
<br>
thinking, I find it indispensable and am surprised you don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You ask for consistency. This suggests that you find my consistency lacking.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, not at all.  I meant no such thing.  I only wanted to
<br>
emphasize that the answers to the above questions ought to
<br>
be consistent, that's all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many aspects of human thought are inconsistent; &quot;society of mind&quot; and all that.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I try for consistency whenever possible.  There is only
<br>
one area, personal values versus universal utilitarian values,
<br>
where I have given up and thrown in the towel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... the seeming fact that the more [many] people look at it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;reality&quot; seems to not always admit of tidy concise consistency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is also correct--that we (humanity) sometimes [[think we]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to] settle for hacks, patches or splines rather than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unified explicable no-holes theory of ethics.  Feel free to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call that wrong.  But wrong, compared to what?
</em><br>
<p>First, I would say that it's not reality that is inconsistent,
<br>
it is only our ideas and interpretations that can be.  Sure,
<br>
sometimes, like right now, we have to settle for quantum 
<br>
mechanics and GR, but it's an inconsistency that people are
<br>
rightly working on to resolve.  Sure, it's true that maybe
<br>
we won't succeed, but mostly it's always a grand effort IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it would be prudent to do a lot more cloning work with other animals /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models before splashing off into cloning people. Evidently, you do not think that.
</em><br>
<p>That's right.  I don't see the harm in bringing things to
<br>
life, and do see harm in letting them lie dead.
<br>
<p>Yes, I do know that this is a revolutionary way of looking
<br>
at life and that it leaves many people uneasy.  To their
<br>
bones, many people still find death somewhat alluring.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it would be a good idea to treat all living beings with kindness.
</em><br>
<p>Hear, hear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet I eat meat on a regular basis. Evidently, I don't think what I think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am aware of the contradiction. &quot;Well, sue me, I'm not mechanical.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, even here is a case where the tradeoffs aren't clear
<br>
to me.  The cattle are better off being bred and slaughtered
<br>
than they would be if people didn't bother to raise them.
<br>
I ask only that they be treated well before they're killed,
<br>
and the killing be done as painlessly as possible.  It will
<br>
be a sad day for the race of cows when people no longer 
<br>
want to eat them.
