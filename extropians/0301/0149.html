<p>
Well, here's my take on it:
<br>
<p>*Before* a new mind comes into existence, I want the mind to have the 
<br>
maximum potential for fun and the maximum probability of fulfilling that 
<br>
potential.
<br>
<p>*After* a new mind comes into existence, it has citizenship rights, 
<br>
including the right not to be terminated, including the right not to be 
<br>
terminated and replaced with another mind that could have 3% more fun. 
<br>
This holds true *even though*, if I'm considering which mind to create and 
<br>
*haven't done it yet*, I should create the mind that can have 3% more fun.
<br>
<p>Morality is a function over 4D spacetimes, not 3D spaces.  If you 
<br>
terminate an existing mind, the termination event is undesirable. 
<br>
Declining to create a *new* unhappy mind is not morally equivalent to 
<br>
*killing* an unhappy mind.  Existing is different from not existing.  If 
<br>
this isn't the case, then instantiating a particular mind has no effect; 
<br>
it already has a Platonic existence or whatever.  If instantiating a mind 
<br>
*does* make a moral difference, then among the moral differences it makes 
<br>
is that *now* the mind has civil rights.
<br>
<p>Which goes to show that parents had better get it right the first time.
<br>
<p>I'm crossposting this to wta-talk because, having expressed my felt 
<br>
responsibility to the countless zillions of sentients who might come into 
<br>
existence after the Singularity, some people accused me of advocating 
<br>
equal rights for all possible people and/or trying to capture the unborn 
<br>
as my unwilling political constituency.  (For those of you who only read 
<br>
Extropians:  Yes, really.)
<br>
<p>I hope this clarifies the moral imperative I see.  *Before* the fact, and 
<br>
only before the fact, a parent has a responsibility to give birth to the 
<br>
best possible child, with the highest potential and greatest probability 
<br>
of happiness.  *After* the fact, any child, once it exists, has a right to 
<br>
go on living.
<br>
<p>I can treasure the possibility that in the future, (a) many (b) 
<br>
high-potential sentients will have come into existence, which is 
<br>
preferable to (a) few (b) low-potential sentients.  This does not mean 
<br>
that all possible sentients must be instantiated.
<br>
<p>The odd idea that I am trying to make the unborn my own political 
<br>
constituency probably comes from reading too many far-left political 
<br>
tracts.  I'm not from that culture; I don't play by those rules myself and 
<br>
wouldn't expect anyone else to pay attention if I did.
<br>
