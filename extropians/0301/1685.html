From: Dickey, Michael F [mailto:<a href="mailto:michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com?Subject=RE:%20Time.com%20asks%20you%20to%20vote%20for%20most%20dangerous%20country">michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com</a>]

<em>&gt; Mez said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Come on, Lee.  Lighten up.  This poll is rather funny.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given that there have been more than 300,000 responses, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does point to a real public sentiment out there.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Funny?  I find the results of this poll disturbing and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sickening.  I would wager that a question such as 'what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most evil country in the world' would garner similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results in Europe and in even in the United States would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably get a 30 - 40% answer in the positive.
</em><br>
<p>*shrug*  The poll was about danger, not evil.  Personally I would vote
<br>
for China or Russia as the most dangerous country in the world today
<br>
over any of the three that were given as options.  Nevertheless, even
<br>
if you completely support the current US &quot;war on terror&quot;, there is a
<br>
perfectly reasonable argument for the US being far more of a danger to
<br>
world peace than N. Korea or Iraq. The US is a radically larger, more
<br>
powerful country.  Its actions can intentionally or unintentionally
<br>
cause ripple effects that result in the fall of nations, the deaths of
<br>
millions, or worse.  The same is not really true today of N. Korea or
<br>
Iraq.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Countries ruled by despotic dictators, theocracies, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monarchies oppose nearly *everything* in the ideals of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians.  I find nothing about perpetuating their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence, or claiming their anti-thetical entities as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'threats to world peace' funny in any way shape or form.  
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you should consider developing a sense of humor?  Laughing at
<br>
the world is quite extropic - it reduces stress, extends life, and
<br>
helps you keep your wits about you so you can better deal with
<br>
whatever situation is so horrible.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The most fervent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporters of the 'anti war' movement in the united states 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are defenders of Slobadon Milosivich, Saddam himself, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chinese Government in the Tienam Square massacre, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually every other leftist murderous tyrant.  
</em><br>
<p>Goodness.  Perhaps there are people like this, but they are not
<br>
representative of the 10s of millions of americans who oppose invasion
<br>
of Iraq.  You appear to be attempting to tar those who oppose you with
<br>
far more heinous stances than they actually hold.
