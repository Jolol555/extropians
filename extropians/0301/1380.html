<em>&gt; Say, you know what?  You might be just the guy to tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Israelis and Palestinians how to get along!  
</em><br>
<p>Not I, but the US plus every government involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What a plan.
</em><br>
<p>What would be your alternative? I mean, the alternative for the long run, 
<br>
a decade at least. Peace is not only the absence of open war. When the 
<br>
hawks on both sides try to spread hatred and divide people into 
<br>
unforgiving opponents, what else could work against that but diplomatics?
<br>
<p>We've seen more astonishing things than that. The peace treaty between 
<br>
Israel and Egypt for example. And another agreement between Israel and 
<br>
Palestine was about to be signed when Sharon and his fellows stormed the 
<br>
holy temple, claiming that whole Jerusalem belongs to Israel alone.
<br>
<p>Every terrorist act has but one goal: To spread hatred, angst and raise 
<br>
prejudices. See Israel: &quot;All palestinians are suicide bombers&quot;. See 
<br>
Palestine: &quot;All Israelis are occupants&quot;. See us: &quot;All Arabs are 
<br>
terrorists&quot;. This circle cannot be broken with weapons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, this should definitely be mentioned not only to the Israelis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Palestinians, but we should &quot;make clear&quot; that other nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should cease executions of politicians, and that it's not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepted instrument of politics.
</em><br>
<p>Ecactly. To every nation including our own. And state terrorists and 
<br>
their employers should be prosecuted everwhere and treated like the 
<br>
criminals they are, by a common, internationally supported court of 
<br>
justice. Should we both write a letter to Mr. Bush, telling him to please 
<br>
observe the agreement of the international court of justice and to revoke 
<br>
the find and kill order he gave to the CIA? Wouldn't that make telling 
<br>
others to be lawful a little more credible?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest you try reading Machiavelli for starters.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of most eras might also, if read with enough cynicism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide very informative lessons.
</em><br>
<p>The major part of known history is made of immoral and selfish rulers 
<br>
who plundered their own country and raided others if possible. The 
<br>
question is whether we can continue this type of politics, when only two 
<br>
dozen determined men can turn a super power into a raving Rambo.
<br>
<p>Macchiavelli was possible in his times, and even then, the methods he 
<br>
described caused a lot of suffering. BTW, he was totally undemocratic and 
<br>
would have given nothing for human rights. He therefore cannot be a role 
<br>
model for modern politics in an interdependend world. Instead, we have 
<br>
to make sure that his followers have no chance to come to power.
