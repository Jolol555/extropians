</em><br>
<p>Most of the world and even most US citizens do not belive a 
<br>
clear and present threat of a magnitude to justify such action 
<br>
has been shown.  Endless assertions it exist without sufficient 
<br>
proof to be convincing will not win for your position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But try to convince that goal to post-colonialist post-modern multicultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativist liberals and see where it gets you.  Accustations of forcing our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crazy cultural ideals like free speech, equal rights, and individual and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil liberties on these other cultures.  Which means we leave them to rot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in oppresion, sexism, and tyranny in the name of 'respecting other cultures'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is not the issue and your characterization is weak in any case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Even if Iraq has to be liberated from Saddam tyranny, that task is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more complicated than just a military action game. The problem will be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; esablish a stable, democratic system, that will honor human rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, this is an idea, which is completely new in that region and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no roots there.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, it is an ideal.  So because it will be tough we shouldn't even try?
</em><br>
<p>We should use reasonable means that don't at the same time shoot 
<br>
us in the foot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We could try putting political pressure on saddam, get the UN inspectors in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or try an embargo, wait, we allready did all those things.  So what should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do, just *hope* he doesn't have or use any weapons of mass destruction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have yet to see any viable alternative course of action presented by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'anti war' groups.  Id be willing to listen of course.    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>We should finish the inspections, insure there are no WMD, and 
<br>
reward compliance by lifting the sanctions bit by bit. We can 
<br>
tie such lifting to more democratization within the country. 
<br>
Over time it will get better.  We have not done some of these 
<br>
things yet.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;And even worse: the US has no interest in such a development.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you know this howwwww....?  Creating a democratic free arab nation over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the largest sources of oil in the world will have profound benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the US.  Not only would it undermine the OPEC oil price fixing, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help to elimate the money Saudi's use to fund terrorists, and create an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example to the Arab world of what a democratic free market embracing arab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation could be like.  This would help to combat many west hating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealogies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see much evidence that we have been attempting to create 
<br>
a free democratic nation in Iraq to date.  That we might make 
<br>
more money off of it is not a reason for going to war. 
<br>
Regardless of the type of government Iraqi oil opening up will 
<br>
not drive prices low enough to serious dent SA cash flow.  If 
<br>
you did do that you would actually also destabilize (further) SA 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;into the hands of its most radical elements most likely.   You 
<br>
don't create democratic free markets by force.
