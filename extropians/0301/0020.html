<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what is being said.  &quot;I served my country as a security 
<br>
intelligence reconnaissance expert for black agencies that don't officially 
<br>
exist.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that says that congress didn't approve of the &quot;black agency&quot; nor 
<br>
did they authorize money to be spent on it.  They do not know of its 
<br>
existance and cannot exercise their constitutional duty of oversight.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where do they find their authorization.  The President or someone 
<br>
in the government has privately decided they need men of this type to to do 
<br>
jobs that an honest member of the FBI or other legitimate government employee 
<br>
wouldn't do because it is illegal.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did the money to pay these &quot;Off the books operatives&quot; come from. 
<br>
&nbsp;It is either money that was discretionary or that was redirected from some 
<br>
other legitimate source.  Possibly the President or whoever collected the 
<br>
money from private sources.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end we have private operatives, being paid unauthorized money 
<br>
to perform services that are illegal.  Doesn't this sound a bit like Nixon's 
<br>
men known as the plumbers or the &quot;private detectives&quot; that Clinton sent to 
<br>
deal with difficult women?  We do know the standing of such men from 
<br>
observing recent history.  when their identity is found out and their deeds 
<br>
proven they often go to the penitentary.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I was much younger I was a management consultant.  As 
<br>
such I had a very good expense account and I spent way too much time hanging 
<br>
out in singles bars.  Samantha I have known a few guys that would use a line 
<br>
like Harvey's on a gullible chick in a bar if they thought it would work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now do you see why I didn't take it seriously when Harvey introduced 
<br>
that line into what is mainly serious intellectual discourse?
<br>
