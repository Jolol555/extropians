<p>Well, I'm not sure, but Fry's and eBay seemed not to have much action
<br>
the last time I checked. Perhaps I am making a shawl from an old sock,
<br>
as the Polish proverb has it.
<br>
<p>I hae a set I bought on eBay that I've only inspected since I got it.
<br>
No, it's not for sale. Yet. :)

<p>Well, &quot;coo;&quot; is what &quot;cool&quot; looks like when you type badly.
<br>
<p>Oh, you meant the other part? Let me see here. There are lots of
<br>
&quot;Hello World&quot; Squeak links, but then there's
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~mark.guzdial/mm-csed-v2.pdf">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~mark.guzdial/mm-csed-v2.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>Mark Guzdial seems to be a cool guy. Here's a little bit from his
<br>
&quot;projects&quot; page (don't have the URL, I'm cutting &amp; pasting from a copy
<br>
on my hard drive, but I'm sure a little mangle-snooping around the above URL
<br>
wll turn it up). He is the source of my comment, due to this pull-quote,
<br>
also found in the larger excerpt below:
<br>
<p>&quot;We have an agenda these days in computer science education.
<br>
We'd like to see &quot;Hello,World!&quot; go away as a first programming activity,
<br>
in favor of more creative multimedia activities.&quot;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Teaching Everyone through/about Dynabooks
<br>
<p>The general ideas of Dynabooks certainly extend beyond Squeak, but
<br>
it's not nearly as easy to do multimedia on other platforms.
<br>
<p>But I think it's well worth while doing it! There is ample evidence
<br>
that Computer Science classes tend to filter out women and other
<br>
minorities, rather than include them. Part of the issue is that early
<br>
CS classes tend to be rather boring. Yet, programs that make music or
<br>
do graphical transitions or combine media are no more complex and work
<br>
just as well for examples and homework as the searches, sorts, and data
<br>
structure assignments that typically fill CS1 and CS2.
<br>
<p>Programming Media in Squeak: We have an agenda these days in computer
<br>
science education. We'd like to see &quot;Hello,World!&quot; go away as a first
<br>
programming activity, in favor of more creative multimedia activities.
<br>
<p>(See editorial.) We've been exploring music, but we'd like to build
<br>
some Squeak-based simple activities in:
<br>
<p>Digital video effects: Compositing, changing colors in video, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Lushi is doing these now)
<br>
Graphics: Blurring, morphing, etc.
<br>
Sound: Chorus, reverb, etc.
<br>
<p>Any interest in trying to build small examples in these media to be
<br>
used in developing CS1/CS2 assignments?
<br>
<p>Extending to our CS1/CS2 classes. I would like to see programs, for
<br>
both DrScheme and Java, to:
<br>
<p>To fill a sound buffer with the samples to generate a tone (e.g., 440
<br>
hz) for two seconds. Once we can do that, we can do just about anything.
<br>
(See examples at <a href="http://swiki.cc.gatech.edu:8080/compMusic/ActiveEssays">http://swiki.cc.gatech.edu:8080/compMusic/ActiveEssays</a>).
<br>
To create a blurring transition between two images. Create a mapping between
<br>
pixels in the source and target images, then for each step (say, 10 steps),
<br>
do a linear transition of color values from the source to the target.
<br>
This is a big step toward interesting animations.
