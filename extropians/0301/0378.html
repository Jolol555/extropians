<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;From what I understand, Natasha doesn't mean that Exi has no

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;a kind of lobby group, after all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ______
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Does ExI have a position as a lobby group?&lt;

<em>&gt; _______
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not currently.
</em><br>
<p>[Brett]
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But my point is that whenever people gather especially when decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to be made about priorities and allocating resources there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _______
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Politics of this sort are social politics and more based on ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions with some philosophy and religion tossed in, don't you think?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure. More than what? I think (picking up on your definitions
<br>
below) many people when they think of politics do think of &quot;the art or
<br>
science of government&quot;, but in the current context I am more drawing
<br>
on that meaning of the word that picks up &quot;the total complex of relations
<br>
between people living in society&quot;. This meaning has as a subset &quot;the art
<br>
or science of government&quot;.
<br>
<p>Let me be a bit less definitionally fixated. The sort of politics I am
<br>
interested in, and I think many on the ExI list would be interested in, is
<br>
the sort of politics that is concerned not with mere esoteric discussions,
<br>
but with actually forging particular futures from a range of possible
<br>
futures.
<br>
Not with merely examining the world including the broader social world but
<br>
engaging with it. I, and I presume most on the ExI list want not so much
<br>
to be concerned with mere ideology, mere philosophy or religion (actually
<br>
in my case religion needs separate consideration) but with pragmatic
<br>
approaches to the propagating of good memes and towards increasing the
<br>
likelihood that good, or at least better social policies rather than bad or
<br>
inferior ones will be implemented.
<br>
<p>My interest, (perhaps call?) to politics, or &quot;social politics&quot;, if you
<br>
prefer is
<br>
a call to relevant pragmatic action *in the world* to achieve our objects
<br>
knowing we will be confronted all along the way with the &quot;you should
<br>
not play God&quot; charge as though we actually have a choice on that matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mean, if politics, formally is &quot;the art or science of government&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also &quot;the sympathies of a person&quot; and even &quot;the total complex of relations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between people living in society&quot;. (<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary">http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Further, even though many Extropians might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;libertarian, or social democrat, or conservative, these leanings are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;orthogonal to being Extropian, and Exi in turn has no bias in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;political dimension, as it does not involve itself in such.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;By the political dimension I'm reading its neither for or against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular political parties that specifically seek government such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the Democracts and Republicans. I don't think it should by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that sort of politic either.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;This doesn't mean that it couldn't talk about having political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;opponents, couldn't lobby political groups, or otherwise engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;the political landscape in representing Extropy. It's just that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;not a political party in and of itself, and doesn't desire to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; __________
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Having gone through Natasha's Pro-Act presentation, I can now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see that some thought has been given to competitors in the meme-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scape.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ________
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This was my objective.  But, it was a lot of thought -:)
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I still thing that the questions I raised run orthogonal to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points though.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ________
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just like orthogonal's etymology, there are many cross-sections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;But I could be wrong. :-)&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Just don't go thinking you've got an exclusive on that terrain :-)&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _________
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excuse me, can we share please? I've earned some of that terrain :-)
</em><br>
<p>Definitely, but just remember, the &quot;Lowest Common Denominator&quot; title
<br>
belongs exclusively to Spike, and he's vigorously defensive of it.
<br>
<p>Oh, that we could live in such a world ;-)
