<em>&gt; *Before* the fact, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only before the fact, a parent has a responsibility to give birth to
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt; best possible child, with the highest potential and greatest
</em><br>
probability  
<br>
<em>&gt; of happiness.  *After* the fact, any child, once it exists, has a
</em><br>
right to 
<br>
<em>&gt; go on living. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Your position is perfectly consistent with the majority of bioethics.
<br>
The only people who argue for equal rights for the unborn are (a)
<br>
Catholics who argue on the basis of potential for personhood (but even
<br>
they stop at conception) and (b) the disability rights hardliners who
<br>
implicitly argue that any selection against disability, even
<br>
pre-conceptive, in the next generation is a crime against those future
<br>
disabled people. Aside from that I know of no philosopher or ethicist
<br>
who has ever argued that all possible people should be born.  
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The odd idea that I am trying to make the unborn my own political 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; constituency probably comes from reading too many far-left political 
</em><br>
<em> &gt; tracts.  
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Likewise I know of no left-wing or far-left party or thinker who has
<br>
ever made such an argument, and its not an argument that would have much
<br>
appeal for a leftist since it is anti-aborion rights.

<p>&quot;Who ever thought that this particular model
<br>
of the body is forever? A little, mammalian,
<br>
furry body, it forever? Sometimes I notice
<br>
my body. It has little fur, little fangs,
<br>
ears still slightly pointed. We are
<br>
spiritual beings still in animal bodies and
<br>
it always struck me as weird.&quot;
