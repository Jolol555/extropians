1. Perpetual Progress
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and effectiveness, an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indefinite lifespan, and the removal of political, cultural,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and self-realization.  Perpetually overcoming constraints on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our progress and possibilities.  Expanding into the universe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and advancing without end.
<br>
<p>All the rest of the extropian principles may be found at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.extropy.org/ideas/principles.html">http://www.extropy.org/ideas/principles.html</a>
<br>
<p>but right now let's focus on the above.  Though clearly this
<br>
can be read, and properly so, as also pertaining to an
<br>
individual, the emphasis on this first extropian principle
<br>
is on society and community.
<br>
<p>Limits, limits, limits---they're the target.  Why are there
<br>
limits?  To what degree did &quot;limits&quot; evolve as a needed part
<br>
of evolutionarily derived societies?  Our answer has to be
<br>
that extremely good explanations can be found for the
<br>
existence of almost any traditional limit---or newly imposed
<br>
limit in the name of some modern ideology---but that nonetheless
<br>
we must relentlessly question their desirability.
<br>
<p>Progress and possibilities---they're the target too, but in the
<br>
positive sense.  Embracing progress usually means examining
<br>
&quot;disturbing&quot; possibilities, but an especial part of extropian
<br>
consciousness is a willingness to entertain disturbing concepts.
<br>
<p>Max More explicates &quot;Perpetual Progress&quot;, the first extropian
<br>
principle further below, as copied from our web site.
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin
<br>
<p>&quot;Extropians seek continual improvement in ourselves, our cultures, and our environments. We seek to improve ourselves physically,
<br>
intellectually, and psychologically. We value the perpetual pursuit of knowledge and understanding. Extropians question traditional
<br>
assertions that we should leave human nature fundamentally unchanged in order to conform to &quot;God's will&quot; or to what is considered
<br>
&quot;natural&quot;. Like our intellectual cousins, the humanists, we seek continued progress in all directions. We go beyond many humanists
<br>
in proposed fundamental alterations in human nature in pursuit of these improvements. We question traditional, biological, genetic,
<br>
and intellectual constraints on our progress and possibility.
<br>
<p>&quot;Extropians recognize the unique conceptual abilities of our species, and our opportunity to advance nature's evolution to new
<br>
peaks. We see humans as a transitional stage standing between our animal heritage and our posthuman future. On the early Earth,
<br>
mindless matter combined so as to form the first self-replicating molecules and life began. Nature's evolutionary processes
<br>
generated increasingly complex organisms with ever-more intelligent brains. The direct chemical responses of single-celled creatures
<br>
led to the emergence of sensation and perception, allowing more subtle and responsive behaviors. Finally, with the development of
<br>
the neocortex, conscious learning and experimentation became possible.
<br>
<p>&quot;With the advent of the conceptual awareness of humankind, the rate of advancement sharply accelerated as we applied intelligence,
<br>
technology, and the scientific method to our condition. We seek to sustain and quicken this evolutionary process, overcoming human
<br>
biological and psychological limits.
<br>
<p>&quot;We do not accept the undesirable aspects of the human condition. We challenge natural and traditional limitations on our
<br>
possibilities. We champion the use of science and technology to eradicate constraints on lifespan, intelligence, personal vitality,
<br>
and freedom. We recognize the absurdity of meekly accepting &quot;natural&quot; limits to our life spans. We expect life to move beyond the
<br>
confines of the Earth -- the cradle of human and transhuman intelligence -- to inhabit the cosmos.
<br>
<p>&quot;Continual improvement will involve economic growth. We see no shortage of resources to allow growth, and we find growth compatible
<br>
with environmental quality. Extropians affirm a rational, non-coercive environmentalism aimed at sustaining and enhancing the
<br>
conditions for our flourishing. Intelligent management of resources and environment will be fostered by vastly extended life spans.
<br>
An effective economic system encourages conservation, substitution, and innovation, preventing any need for a brake on growth and
<br>
progress. Migration into space will immensely enlarge the energy and resources accessible to our civilization. Extended life spans
<br>
may foster wisdom and foresight, while restraining recklessness and profligacy. We pursue continued individual and social
<br>
improvement carefully and intelligently.
<br>
<p>&quot;We value perpetual learning and exploration as individuals, and we encourage our cultures to experiment and evolve. We are neither
<br>
conservatives nor radicals: we conserve what works, for as long as it works, and we alter that which can be improved. In our search
<br>
for continual improvement we steer carefully between complacence and recklessness.
<br>
<p>&quot;No mysteries are sacrosanct, no limits unquestionable; the unknown will yield to the ingenious mind. We seek to understand the
<br>
universe, not to tremble before mystery, as we continue to learn and grow and enjoy our lives ever more.&quot;
