Considering your arguments on how important it is to find the evidence, 
<br>
could you believe it if it were found?  I'm certain that if they decide 
<br>
to invade that they will announce proofs.  But I doubt whether the 
<br>
proofs will be checkable independant of sources that benefit from their 
<br>
being correct.  This doesn't mean that the evidence is faked, it means 
<br>
that being certain that it isn't is... dubious.
<br>
<p>In this way it is like most of history.  Pravda, I am told, means &quot;the 
<br>
official word&quot;, with a secondary meaning of &quot;the truth&quot;.  And in Egypt 
<br>
the Goddess Maat is called the goddess of Truth, but was actually the 
<br>
goddess of &quot;the party line&quot;.
