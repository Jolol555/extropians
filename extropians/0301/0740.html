I understand what your saying. The writers would have to get paid, morally 
<br>
and economically.
<br>
<p>Most goverments control education to some extent. Any information that has a 
<br>
scientific basis, is based on facts, is education. I would much rather have 
<br>
a goverment who spends money to pay writers so that there work is free to 
<br>
the public. This is very communistic but so is controlling education in the 
<br>
first place. Many people would rather privitize all education. This may lead 
<br>
to cheaper and therefore better education all around. I dissagree with this 
<br>
in the long run, the level of education between the rich and poor students 
<br>
will get further and further apart. By making any sorce of education subject 
<br>
to a free market you will create a class bias education system not only for 
<br>
your country but for every country. It doesn't take long to go to most run 
<br>
down trailer parks and immediately notice the difference in intelligence 
<br>
from middle and upperclass communities. With many current systems of 
<br>
education I can't see how this problem can be resolved.
<br>
In America something has to be done. If the richest country in the world's 
<br>
education system is constant turning out a large percentage of stupid people 
<br>
than how will any progress occur accept very slowly by the top 1% of the 
<br>
very intelligent.
<br>
<p>What do you think?

<em>&gt; &gt; Actually I find the hording of information by the super powers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thier middle and upperclasses a hundred times more selfish than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person stealing copies of books. It ensures thier dominance over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and other people. Isn't that the definition of a selfish act, to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself before others. Of course it's not practical to get everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same page but it couldn't hurt to make the information accessable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some form or another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just what sort of 'hoarding' are you speaking of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Putting yourself before others is simply human nature. If you seek to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;put me in chains, I will surely put my interest in living free before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your interest in enslaving me, to the point of violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stealing the hard work of another is slavery, pure and simple. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't matter if you only want to enslave that person by a small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fraction of their output.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Information is accessible to all. That is what libraries are for. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you want isn't free access, it is to steal whole books, to HOARD books,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hidden away from the access of others, for your own personal use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without paying for the privilege.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What possible disadvantages could there be by allowing non-fiction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; books to be free on the internet. What, you have to have a commitee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to determine what is non-fiction. If people want to make money they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shouldn't be trying to reflect objective Truth in a scientific way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like you say we are trying to do.  Trying to make money will create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a more non-scientific text because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people will write to sell, not write the truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By what rational logic or other moral/ethical argument can you say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fiction should be protected but non-fiction should be free?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The non-fictional work of an author is still work, and they deserve to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be paid for their work in proportion to it's popularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Science texts have always gotten MORE accurate, and have also always
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been far more profitable, and expensive, than fiction or other lighter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reading books. For example, Isaac Asimov earned far more money from his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science books than from his science fiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At a certain piont extropians have to worship a religion called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; causation. They have to believe thier is nothing random and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undeterminable. They must believe that what they think pertains in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some way to reality. If they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than what's the piont of any of this? Why not worship any religion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is reality is that if writers cannot get paid for their work, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will not write. Most artists will not create, not nearly to the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they do, if they cannot earn something for their work. Those that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to do so will never reach the same number of consumers without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the legal and justifiable profit-seeking investment of publishers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;galleries, music distributors, etc. Those that ignore this reality are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same sort of fools that thought that socialism and communism were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;valid economic systems.
