<p>This throws in the Luddites with those people who *do* understand.
<br>
The idea behind hydrogen as an intermediate fuel is to go from a
<br>
large number of small poluters to a small number of large poluters
<br>
that can be turned into not quite so large poluters or even
<br>
non-poluters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since hydrogen does not exist in geological reservoirs it must
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The former.  Looking at the followups, everybody here seems to be
<br>
thinking electrolysis of water.  See below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The process of extracting hydrogen uses energy, which means that using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogen is less efficient that burning fossil fuels.
</em><br>
<p>This does not follow.  There is a chain of efficiencies involved
<br>
that you need to add up (multiply, actually).  The final outcome
<br>
is not trivially obvious.  A modern fossil fuel power plant is far
<br>
closer to the thermodynamic limits than a measly car engine.  Economy
<br>
of scale comes into play big time here.  And besides we are talking
<br>
about other processes anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a recent energy-technology review in Science magazine pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out last November, &quot;Per unit of heat generated, more CO2 is produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by making H2 [hydrogen] from fossil fuel than by burning the fossil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel directly.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You need to quote the conditions and assumptions that went into
<br>
that as well.
<br>
<p>Here's something you probably want to start looking into:

<em>&gt;Nope.  What all the proponents of a hydrogen economy try frantically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to steer attention away from is the need to generate energy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufacture the hydrogen.  And for the foreseeable future, that source
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is oil. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the source is coal and/or natural gas.  You can make hydrogen
<br>
from oil, but it's at the bottom of the list of fossil fuels you'd use
<br>
for the purpose.
<br>
<p>But all of the fossil fuels are way above solar or nuclear electrolysis.
<br>
You want hydrogem, you *don't* use electricty, which can be generated
<br>
with only mediocre efficiency, to try and strip hydrogen from the most
<br>
tightly bound of its common compounds, water.  Heat and chemistry work
<br>
much better.
