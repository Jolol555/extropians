</em><br>
<p><p>I don't have time for this.  More senseless than war X does not 
<br>
make a firm claim how senseless war X was.  I believe it was 
<br>
pretty damn senseless but I don't have time, energy or 
<br>
inclination to debate that when we are about to do something 
<br>
REALLY stupid.  Can I make it any more clear without people 
<br>
wasting their fine minds picking at every sentence?
<br>
<p><p>If you want something productive to do then show precisely how 
<br>
this war is a really, really good thing and that nothing very 
<br>
bad will come from it.  Personally I haven't heard that really 
<br>
done by anyone.  Without that the charge of it being &quot;senseless&quot; 
<br>
and a Bad Idea (tm) stands.  The burden of proof is on those who 
<br>
advocate this mess.
