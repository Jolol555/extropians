Hi!

</em><br>
<p>Really? A few years ago, he invited me to visit his group and asked me if I 
<br>
wanted to do my Ph.D. with him. I found him very interesting and had a 
<br>
couple of profitable discussions with him. I was told he's using QTL 
<br>
analysis to map loci in mice involved in aging. Is that true?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the message here may be that aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a multi-factorial process (as the evolutionary biology of aging perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would suggest).
</em><br>
<p>I made my case before as to why I don't think aging is multifactorial. In 
<br>
the context of CR, my argument would be: why assume there are different 
<br>
mechanisms operating for each of the phenomena of CR when it can be all the 
<br>
same mechanism. In fact, CR derives from a very simple intervention, a 
<br>
decrease in caloric intake.
<br>
<p>As for evolutionary theory of aging, I recently re-read some of the old 
<br>
papers by Williams and Medawar. One surprising discovery I made was that 
<br>
Medawar was actually an advocate of one or a few physiological processes as 
<br>
the ultimate explanation of aging. &quot;He envisioned the essential task of 
<br>
gerontologists to be that of distinguishing cause from effect among the 
<br>
multitude of observable changes in aging organisms, and eventually 
<br>
isolating the presumably few ultimate causes&quot; [Williams 1957]. So, to my 
<br>
surprise, Medawar actually would agree with me--if he were alive--when I 
<br>
say aging is caused by one or a few processes. In addition, modern 
<br>
evolutionary theory--Kirkwood, Rose, etc.--fails to explain so many 
<br>
observations--non-aging animals, single-gene interventions in mice that 
<br>
delay aging--that I don't think evolutionary theory of aging should be used 
<br>
as a theoretical foundation to understand the biology of aging.
<br>
<p>All the best.
