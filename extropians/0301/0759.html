<p><em>&gt; REMEMBER WHEN...
</em><br>
<p>I love the theme of this post!  But I do have a few nitpicks...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember when..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At high school in the 1970s you read commentators saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorically that cloning could never successfully occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our lifetime. It's only science fiction...
</em><br>
<p>If you're talking about human cloning, we're still waiting.
<br>
<p>And if those commentators were 40 years old, the are probably dead by now
<br>
and never did see the current day in their lifetimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the 1970s people stared at you and shook their heads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you claimed O'Neill colonies, automated linear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerators on the moon and La Grange point inhabitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would happen in our lifetime. It's only science fiction.
</em><br>
<p>Still waiting...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember when...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1980 people stared at you and shook their heads when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you claimed automated planes and beam weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were the future of warfare in the relatively near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future. It's only science fiction.
</em><br>
<p>I think the jury's still out on this one.  I know it is the planned future,
<br>
but I'm still not convinced that it will work anytime soon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember when...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1982 people stared at you and shook their heads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you claimed principles of automation including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modularity and self-reproduction would lead to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abolition of manual work. It's only science fiction.
</em><br>
<p>Your kidding right?  You expect the abolition of manual work in your
<br>
lifetime?  I don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember when...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the early 1980s people stared at you and shook
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their heads when you claimed new materials would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to space towers in our lifetime. It's only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science fiction.
</em><br>
<p>This is still not feasible yet.  I think the claims are exaggerated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember when...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the late 1980s people stared at you and shook
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their heads when you claimed new experiments on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals resulting in extended lifespan would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an impact on them in a few decades.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe calorie restriction might help some, but we don't have any major
<br>
extensions in lifespan yet.
<br>
<p>These were all good points, but many of them are still science fiction.  I
<br>
am concerned that anybody would confuse them with proven facts at this
<br>
stage.  They are worthwhile endeavors for investigation, but they are
<br>
certainly not accomplished yet or definitely certain.
<br>
