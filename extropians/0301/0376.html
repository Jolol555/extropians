<p>I would have to sit and go through them in detail but I believe the
<br>
existing nanopart designs differ with &quot;natural&quot; abundances quite
<br>
significantly.  (See Table 6 in
<br>
<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/MatrioshkaBrains.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/MatrioshkaBrains/MatrioshkaBrains.html</a>)
<br>
<p>I agree with the statement that nano-bio-tech only need &quot;traces&quot; of
<br>
heavier elements but would offset that with the fact that it seems
<br>
unlikely that the element abundances in the outer (or inner) solar
<br>
system are likely to provide optimal element utilization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nanotechnology will be very happy with carbon mostly.
</em><br>
<p>Hrmph.  The Neon Pump seems to have a ~29%/29% H/C atom allocation
<br>
and a 26% Si allocation -- that isn't the common ratio of those
<br>
atoms anyplace in the universe that I know of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hydrogen/Deuterium/Lithium is fuel/fuel precursor.
</em><br>
<p>While I agree that Li could be used as a fuel, it may be better
<br>
used as an energy (neutron) capture fluid.  One of the fundamental
<br>
problems with most fusion reactions is *&quot;how do you capture the
<br>
energy released?&quot;*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we can focus energy (beamed microwaves from the inner solar system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbiting machinery) towards selected habitats to propel and/or power them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or spin up material from the deep orbits.
</em><br>
<p>But this places a &quot;plutino&quot; at the mercy of its energy source.  (Or individuals
<br>
that would block the energy path).  Unless you have a solar-system wide
<br>
system of governence and legal enforcement this is a very fragile situation.
<br>
<p>I also think you may be underestimating either the mass requirements for
<br>
refocusing a beam across 40-60 AU (or collecting a beam that has spread
<br>
across that distance).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nanotechnology and lots of hard vacuum and microgravity along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryogenic temperatures (for cryomagnets?) seems to help a lot with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building reactors.
</em><br>
<p>Not enough IMO though I may be wrong.  I don't think this approach has
<br>
been studied sufficiently.  You still have the problem that you have to
<br>
be able to extract the energy from the fusion engine and turn it into
<br>
something more user friendly.  The technologies for doing that are
<br>
very crude at this point -- and we don't know whether or not they
<br>
can be significantly improved upon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Li abundances:
</em><br>
<p>Eugen, can you cite some references for your table so I can reconcile
<br>
it with my tables?  [Thanks!]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doesn't look too shabby. Li burns too easily in stars, not in fusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reactors. So there will be very little lossage of it, to breed tritium.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not worried about Li loss to breed tritium.  I'm worried about having
<br>
enough of it for optimal capture of the energy being produced by the fusion
<br>
reactions.  Now it may be that we can go to Na/K energy capture blankets --
<br>
if so that is fine -- but this is beyond my level of understanding of fusion
<br>
reactor mechanics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Light elements are fuel. There's no point in using all of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately. For that small fraction of them which will be used there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough heavier elements.
</em><br>
<p>This depends in large part on the fuel cycle and the energy capture
<br>
cycle of the reactor.  I think we are too early in the development
<br>
of these paths to state with any amount of certainty how the allocation
<br>
of resources will play out and where the element shortages may develop.
