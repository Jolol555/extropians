</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think there is a tremendous value in simply changing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word employed.  I was attempting to point out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) belief in an afterlife or something near magical (e.g. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity) is not confined to the religious;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) such belief does not necessarily imply irresponsibility in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the real world&quot; or at least the one we deal with now.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with point 1) as the superstitious also believe.
<br>
<p>As for 2) I'm still trying to make the case that using the
<br>
word &quot;belief&quot; when genuine alternatives are available is a
<br>
poor strategic and political choice. I'm not calling anyone 
<br>
irresponsible at this stage. 
<br>
<p>But would you be willing to *voluntarily* stop using the
<br>
word belief if you were convinced it carried too much
<br>
negative baggage?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;The point of bringing this up is that belief in a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;beyond this one, even of the more conventionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;religious kind, is not automatically a sign of serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;psychological problems and limitations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Serious psychological problems by the standard of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; times, no, I agree. Limitations, I'm not so sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not altogether sure of this myself.  However, an opposing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument could be made that people who do not have belief 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern X have some limitations or will act sub-optimally for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the good of themselves or the group in some situations.
</em><br>
<p>That's interesting. How would such an argument run?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Now, it is true that many who do believe in an &quot;afterlife&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;and even some that believe in some types of techno-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;transcendence, consider things of &quot;this life&quot; of not enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;importance to spend much time maximizing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sorry, maximizing what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Things of this life&quot; was what I had (loosely) in mind.
</em><br>
<p>Ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone believes that the Singularity is acheivable in say 5 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years and that it will make problems taking longer than this to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfold go away then it follows that they will not be so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in addressing these longer range problems. 
</em><br>
<p>That makes sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person beliefs say that this world is a place for overcoming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their attachments to ego and phsycial earth life (as some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religions do)
</em><br>
<p>Really? Could you give an example?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then they wouldn't have much interest in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizing those things logically or in improving many aspects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the physical conditions of humanity.  
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But most sets of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions/beliefs about what is and is not important and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ranking of values will logically influence what one does and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not consider important and how one evaluates most issues of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the day.  The effect is not limited to those beliefs one happens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to despise or even to &quot;believing&quot; in the abstract.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry I didn't understand. I'm confused about why &quot;logically&quot;.
<br>
Could you paraphrase?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Belief makes for bad social policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Personally I get a little tweaked by &quot;social policy&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;It smacks of collectivism and of centralized power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;of some supposed limit on individual rights to come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;whatever conclusions or  beliefs by whatever methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;they see fit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When I talk of &quot;social policy&quot; in this context I mean it quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simply as the way social groups (societies if you will) make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decisions as to how to allocate resources amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves, and what rights there should be that they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; each undertake to accepts some personal responsibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for so that these rights are not just theoretical but are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually underwritten in practice by the free decisions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others in the social compact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately when some of the social group bring belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the supernatural into their considerations they can start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to imagine that the nexus between rights granted and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsibilities assumed can be broken. That somehow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because the supernatural underwriter is going to step in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if necessary societies can grant rights without its members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needing to merely confine themselves to real resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the real capacity of the society to underwrite those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe that real rights are something granted by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society or that they must be paid for by duties/responsibilities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the society. 
</em><br>
<p>Ok. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do of course agree that it is foolish not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in reality instead of fantasies.  But human rights are a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mockery if they are merely what your tribe deigns to give you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and determines the payment for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Problem is when citizens try to rely on rights that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; underwritten by real responsibilities they find those rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot be relied on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree strongly with your entire model of rights here.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough. I am interested in why, but perhaps you'd 
<br>
like to tell me your model of rights if you have one. I'm
<br>
certainly interested.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I need to get to know someone before I give them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the benefit of  the doubt as to having done either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;qualitative or quantitative analysis of any sort *if*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;they say they have arrived at a position based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;faith or belief.  Actually if the used the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;arrived at a position&quot; I'd probably raise my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;evaluation a bit. If they use another word instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of believe,  like perceive, think, suspect etc.. I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; there's a better chance of some sort of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;processing going on. That they are not just parroting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;what they've heard. I guess I apply a crude sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Turing test to people. I suspect that some others that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;have a strong commitment to reason also make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;assessments on  the basis of language. Assessments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;which are not facts, but are definitely not mere beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;There is also the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;matter of a more inductive approach to certain questions of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;and value.  For that matter, the entire sphere of values is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;easily reduced to that which reason alone recommends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Certainly not easily. But as I hope has become a little more clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through the course of this reply I am looking a reasoning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believing very much in the context of what they mean for the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think you can get much buy-in to a social compact that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts to remove &quot;believing&quot; as such.
</em><br>
<p>You may be right but I'll give it a shot a bit longer anyway :-)
<br>
<p>Actually, I'm not trying to get all of *society* to voluntarily give up
<br>
using the word belief and to instead use more precise terms or 
<br>
alternatives when they are available just those extropians who I can
<br>
persuade to do so of their own volition by reasoned argument. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also, perhaps some &quot;values&quot; in the &quot;entire sphere&quot; should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; valued. Perhaps belief should not be valued. I don't value it. I value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people (even believers). I respect their right to have opinions and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use words like belief. But I don't currently respect belief as such, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think its anti-social at worst and a-social at best.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That you have made clear.  But I am not convinced belief as such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in all areas can be avoided.
</em><br>
<p>But can you think of any instances where you yourself would feel you'd
<br>
*have to* use it to correctly convey your meaning?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Please do consider ditching &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beings&quot; from your operating language when other terms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;I'm talking again as a political animal, not merely or mainly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;philosophical one. I am pursuing change and very aware of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;important it is to win the votes on issues in democracies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;It is not important.  The votes are a game generally to persuade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;the people they actually are in control.  The counter-evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;is easily found.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't understand this comment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Voting is becoming a charade that really effects nearly nothing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imho.  The government is generally out of control of the people. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having the people vote even super-rationally will not imo likely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be sufficient to bring it under control.
</em><br>
<p>I still don't think I understand your viewpoint exactly.
<br>
<p>Does the following capture your meaning correctly?
<br>
<p>&quot;Voting in elections in democracies effects nothing of particular 
<br>
significance as those in government and hence government itself are
<br>
out of the effective control of even a majority of the people. Therefore
<br>
having more voters voting more rationally is unlikely to bring those
<br>
in government and thus the government under control.&quot; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry just in case that was missed, the pivot point on embryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;stem cell research around the world at present (politically)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;speaking is whether an embryo is a human being. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;it is. It exists and its human. Its not a person though. So if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;don't want to propagate and validate the confusion we'd better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;use the term person and people and personhood or some such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;equivalents when we mean them instead of the less precise terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;or we are running the risk of helping believers giving us social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;policies whereby actually persons (sick people) cannot be given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the fullest level of care, because we've traded off their rights as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a class against the rights of some potential people (embryos) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;a class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;A good point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thank you, I've worked on it and I continue to work on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;However, it would be MUCH better to remove stem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;cell research and development from that which is subject to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;vote&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you can tell me how we can do that in practice Samantha
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I'd be very interested to here it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reimpose strict Constitutional limits on what the government has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any right to stick its nose in.  Exactly how we would get there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from here is a very good question.  It is also one I think we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better put some considerable effort into answering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Do you mean modify the Constitution to put addition constraints on
<br>
government? I think you'd need to state the goal a little more clearly
<br>
that &quot;what the government has any right to stick its nose in&quot;  :-) even 
<br>
before moving on the question of implementing the goal. Perhaps
<br>
you might actually get support and buy-in if you say what exactly 
<br>
you'd like the new constitutional constraints to cover.
<br>
<p>Not being in the US I'm a bit foggy on the details of the US 
<br>
Constitution but I am a bit of a fan of it. Australia doesn't have any 
<br>
sort of Bill of Rights for citizens at all, its all fuzzy conventions. 
<br>
<p>I would be interested in what constitutional amendments you'd
<br>
like to see effected. And I think that articulating them would be
<br>
a necessary first step towards getting them implemented.
<br>
<p>Regards,
