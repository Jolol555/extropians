<p>
Actually I find the hording of information by the super powers and thier 
<br>
middle and upperclasses a hundred times more selfish than one person 
<br>
stealing copies of books. It ensures thier dominance over other countries 
<br>
and other people. Isn't that the definition of a selfish act, to put 
<br>
yourself before others. Of course it's not practical to get everyone on the 
<br>
same page but it couldn't hurt to make the information accessable in some 
<br>
form or another.
<br>
<p>What possible disadvantages could there be by allowing non-fiction books to 
<br>
be free on the internet. What, you have to have a commitee to determine what 
<br>
is non-fiction. If people want to make money they shouldn't be trying to 
<br>
reflect objective Truth in a scientific way like you say we are trying to 
<br>
do.  Trying to make money will create a more non-scientific text because 
<br>
people will write to sell, not write the truth.
<br>
<p>At a certain piont extropians have to worship a religion called causation. 
<br>
They have to believe thier is nothing random and undeterminable. They must 
<br>
believe that what they think pertains in some way to reality. If they do not 
<br>
than what's the piont of any of this? Why not worship any religion?
<br>
<p>Some person writes
<br>
<p>Ah, another chance to combat misperceptions, disinformation, and
<br>
ignorance...

<p>Just because you don't get a ticket every time you speed doesn't mean

you aren't breaking the law. While there are many laws on the books
<br>
(including speed limits) which in my opinion do nothing but promote

disrespect for the Law in general, to give in to that seed of

disrespect is the road not to Anarchy, but chaos, which is an entirely

undesirable thing for anybody.
<br>
<p>There is a place for civil disobedience, for sure. But don't mask pure

greedy looting as anything more noble than what it really is, and not

wanting to pay for someone else's hard work is far more greedy and

selfish than the creator wanting to get paid for their work.

</em><br>
<p>The Bible was a world wide best seller long before free copies of it
<br>
were available. In fact, for more than a thousand years of history,
<br>
copies of the bible were so expensive that they cost several years
<br>
salary to obtain one. Churches were so ubiquitous in communities
<br>
because of the huge community investment needed to house that one book,
<br>
and to have someone who was literate to read it to the rest of the
<br>
community, to protect that one book from damage by hands soiled in the
<br>
fields, or callused from the plow or the smithy.
<br>
<p>For a good chunk of human history, the Bible has been the equivalent of
<br>
the computer: a rather expensive device, even in it's most inexpensive
<br>
versions, and never found for free, though one might be borrowed for a
<br>
time, as at a library.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Then you don't know the first thing about extropy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know people have to make a living but beyond that there main concern 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;can.
</em><br>
<p>Extropy is not a religion. It doesn't need to evangelize, it simply is,
<br>
and becomes, as a result of it reflecting Objective Truth in a more
<br>
accurate, scientific way, not superstitious guesswork and flim
<br>
flammery.
