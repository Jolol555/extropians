<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Even in values, it is unwise [as Brett has pointed out] to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; say &quot;Blah, blah blah, and blah. This is what I BELIEVE!&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; e.g., &quot;It is horrible and obscene and cruel and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; WRONG for a woman to cut the arms off her daughter, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE&quot;, completely shutting oneself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; down further critical inquiry and pursuit of consistency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An example comes to mind:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ---------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I BELIEVE that &quot;human life&quot; begins at conception, therefore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; should not be permitted *even* if it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  be shown that the lives of many sick people would be saved by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  it&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ---------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but in fairness to the anti-abortionists, it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be noted that this example is hypothetical. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't ever remembering seeing any of them use this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wording, and therefore reveal themselves as suffering this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, but *this one* comes from the leader of government business in 
<br>
the lower house. Tony Abbott MP. Looks pretty similar to me.
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
&quot;I believe (sic) that life (sic) begins at conception. I believe that any 
<br>
other points we might choose are essentially arbitrary and uncertain.
<br>
And I believe that this is a view founded not in religion, not in faith,
<br>
but on the logic of the matter. ....
<br>
<p>[L]et me make this very clear: even if destroying embryos to harvest
<br>
their stem cells could create the medical miracles, which are now
<br>
so commonly claimed, I would be against it, because there are some
<br>
things that we cannot do, no matter how good the cause.&quot;
<br>

<br>
[The above link will take you to the Hansard record for the relevant
<br>
day. If you put &quot;believe&quot; in your browser and search the PDF
<br>
you'll see it for yourself. ]
<br>
<p>And in fairness to the anti-abortionists not all of them are against
<br>
&quot;therapeutic cloning&quot; I'm pretty sure American Senator Orin Hatch
<br>
is both pro-life and pro-therapeutic cloning. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; True, many of them seem to act as though this is how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are thinking---but on the other hand, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many reasoned defenses of the anti-abortionist stand.
</em><br>
<p>They start from a position of faith or belief assume that as an axiom
<br>
and reason from there. When what needs to be made are resourcing
<br>
decisions and a large part of the community start with the belief that
<br>
there another life coming by supernatural action that is no trivial 
<br>
axiom. A large part of the solution to all human problems is &quot;assumed&quot;
<br>
away. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But can't you think of innocent sentences that contain those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts (the innocent form of the &quot;I believe&quot; one, anyway)?
</em><br>
<p>Innocent yes. I'm not arguing that belief is malicious I'm arging
<br>
that it is unsophisticated to the point of being in some cases, where
<br>
it becomes part of the basis for determining social policy in 
<br>
democracies extremely dangerous to believers and non-believers
<br>
alike. I am also arguing that their is never a good reason for an 
<br>
extropian to use the word (there are always better words available)
<br>
and that therefore it well behoves us to avoid reinforcing the
<br>
perception that believing is as valid as reasoning in a social world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I said earlier, I think that one must read between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines, and be on the lookout for bad concepts, and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular words employed aren't a reliable guide.
</em><br>
<p>I can do that. You can do that. Most extropians can do that.
<br>
But why rely on the general population to read between the
<br>
lines when it is within our power and costs us nothing but a little
<br>
bit of disciple to make the moral difference between believing and 
<br>
reasoning more clear. Perhaps you don't agree that there is 
<br>
a moral difference?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; *If* the stakes were not so high, it would almost be comic that the,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;true believers&quot; defense of &quot;human life&quot; leads to an increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the chances of actual persons (sick people) dying earlier and harder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than they otherwise might have.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The burden of proof is definitely on them to suggest how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it could be that allegiance to human life or living could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in banning, for example, stem cell research.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do know what they'd say; it would be something like
</em><br>
<p>If some people are making policy, social policy, national laws on 
<br>
stem cells strongly under the influence of beliefs and holding the 
<br>
notion that &quot;we&quot; must not play God, is it not sensible for us to 
<br>
tackle and challenge those notions of believing (which is personal)
<br>
and the notion that &quot;we should not play God&quot; which involves some 
<br>
substantial beliefs, head on, or at least to do our bit to deprive
<br>
the believers of the moral high ground?   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;When you understand that (a) human life really begins at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception and (b) politically, the use of stem cells will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitably lead to the sacrifice of many innocents, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will understand that suppressing this evil really is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better for human life and human persons in the long run.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course you and I balk at the idea of 10^-4 seconds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before conception there is zero (0) persons and 10^-4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds following conception there is one (1) fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal human being.  AND THAT'S WHERE OUR REAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DIFFERENCES WITH THEM LIE!  Not in word usage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (this time).
</em><br>
That's where our philosopical differences lie, but it doesn't stop
<br>
with philosophy. Peoples worldviews are taken with them into
<br>
parliaments and congress and votes are taken there that effect
<br>
all of us profoundly.
<br>
<p>I balk also at using the term human beings. If we use the terms
<br>
&quot;human beings&quot; and &quot;human life&quot; to describe persons we cede 
<br>
them terminology and the moral and political high ground. Our
<br>
use of these terms when we mean persons reinforces their abuse
<br>
of the terms putting them in the position of being able to argue 
<br>
one &quot;human being&quot; or one &quot;human life&quot; is as good as another,
<br>
which we know is patently absurd (cancer cells are human life,
<br>
sperm is human life) its not what we know that determines laws
<br>
&nbsp;its what the majority in the community or their representatives
<br>
&nbsp;vote on in  parliament and in congress. If we encourage or don't
<br>
oppose the use of such language we will see it used against us
<br>
over and over. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Actually whilst I think my point on belief is valid, I think the 
<br>
urgency is greater for understanding the harm that can arise by
<br>
allowing the notion that all forms of &quot;human life&quot; or all &quot;human
<br>
beings&quot; are morally equal to go unchallenged. I think it behoves
<br>
us to propagate the concept of personhood. And the best place
<br>
to start is with our own use of thoughts and language.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But then the &quot;true believers&quot; don't really believe the dead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are &quot;dead&quot; and they are often quite willing to act on that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;belief&quot; and implement policy consistent with it if they can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And policy that becomes law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; applies to everyone. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I see nothing semantically wrong with their belief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I thought that the fact was that there is a Supreme Being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who'd deliver the actual consciousness of dead people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heaven, then I'd have no objection to what they claim.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only an *ontological* difference I have with them, not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semantic one.
</em><br>
<p>Its not just about semantics, its about the consequences for 
<br>
social policy when those who believe in a Supreme Being of
<br>
the sort that will underwrite rights and that offers a form of
<br>
afterlife for free vote in large numbers on the basis of that belief.
<br>
<p>With the concept of a Supreme Being typically comes the 
<br>
notion of &quot;God&quot; given rights. Problem is these god given rights
<br>
are sometimes attempted to be translated into secular rights (as
<br>
with the stem cell debate) can't be effectively underwritten by 
<br>
secular resources so what actually happens is that secular
<br>
responsibilies cannot be fulfilled. Societies cannot carry out
<br>
the same level of rights underwriting. Believers don't have the
<br>
capability to underwrite the God given rights they want to see
<br>
incorporated into the social compact but that doesn't stop them
<br>
from trying and it does undermine the social compact. When 
<br>
you break the nexus between rights granted by a society and 
<br>
rights assumed by the citizens of a society and try an pad the
<br>
rights side with supernatural extras the books no longer balance. 
<br>
<p>And as we know believers don't stop at trying to secularise
<br>
God given rights with resources that are not available they also
<br>
tend to have beliefs about what is permissible to be done in
<br>
a secular society to increase our capacity to underwrite new
<br>
rights - I'm referring now to the old chestnut &quot;we should not
<br>
play God&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (By the way, there is a huge difference between terminological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disputes, which are comparatively trivial, and semantic ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which involve concepts.  Korzybski's general semanticists have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeeded in spreading the correct memes concerning the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  IMO.)
</em><br>
<p>I've written a lot in this post and others now about the prudence
<br>
of extropians choosing to avoid the terms &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
<br>
beings&quot; when they actually mean persons or people and about 
<br>
using alternative words for &quot;belief&quot;. I see this not as an exercise 
<br>
in Newspeak but about adopting better, clearer, word-memes,
<br>
and depriving those who would use these words in political forums
<br>
working against extropian aspirations from appearing to have the
<br>
moral high ground. 
<br>
<p>But am I getting anywhere at all?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
