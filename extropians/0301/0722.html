<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/ausguns.htm">http://www.snopes.com/science/stats/ausguns.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excerpt:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then we have the claim that &quot;In the state of Victoria alone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent.&quot; This is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of how misleading statistics can be when the underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers are not provided: Victoria, a state with a population of over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four-and-a-half million people in 1997, experienced 7 firearm-related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homicides in 1996 and 19 firearm-related homicides in 1997 (an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase of 171%, not 300%). An additional twelve homicides amongst a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population of 4.5 million is not statistically significant, nor does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this single-year statistic adequately reflect long-term trends.
</em><br>
<p>The original publisher of those statistics did not refer to gun related
<br>
homicides, but homicides in general. Homicides of all types are up
<br>
300%.
<br>
<p>I might also add that in the same period, my home state of NH, which
<br>
has one of the highest levels of private firearms ownership in the
<br>
world, posted the lowest murder rate in the US, and on a par with
<br>
Switzerland (it is referred in Fodor's travel guides as &quot;The
<br>
Switzerland of North America&quot;, partly for this reason). A law abiding
<br>
citizen here can own machine guns, silencers, and obtain destructive
<br>
devices following only federal tax regulations.
<br>
<p>In the period referenced for Australia, NH's murder rate went from
<br>
comparable to Britain down to comparable to Switzerland.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moreover, the opening paragraph mixes two very different types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics -- number of homicides vs. percentage of homicides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed with firearms. In the latter case, it should be noted that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Australia-wide percentage of homicides committed with firearms is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now lower than it was before the gun buy-back program, and lower than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has been at any point during the past ten years. (In the former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, the absolute number of firearm homicides in Australia in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1998-99 was the lowest in the past ten years.) 
</em><br>
<p>Yet as has been warned by gun-rights advocates, criminals simply
<br>
switched their weapons of choice, and more of those killed have been
<br>
innnocent citizens who are now unable to defend themselves with their
<br>
now confiscated firearms, rather than criminals dying justly in the
<br>
commission of their crimes.
