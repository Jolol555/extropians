</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have ever encountred on this list.  President Bush is a grade-A jerk who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should never ever have been allowed into the oval office.  He is a clear and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present danger to this country and to world peace and stability.  Where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly are these brilliant answers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, Samantha, but did you happen to read for content?  Or far better did you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen to read the email that did a wonderful job of explaining this issue?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alternatively did you just grab a phrase you could make something out of and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blast off for outer space.
</em><br>
<p>What email are you referring to precisely?  I have read most 
<br>
emails and have seen no such wonderful explanation so far. 
<br>
Perhaps I missed one.  Please point it out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        For example you made a comment in one of your postings about Bush, &quot;He 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a useful idiot, useful to those who do not have America's best interest as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their agenda.&quot;  In the first place I doubt you have any idea what either his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IQ or his GPA is.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;From his statements and posturings I make the above statement. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't need his IQ or GPA to note he is an idiot.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having graduated a rival MBA program I truly doubt you
<br>
<em>&gt; have any idea what the program for MBAs at Harvard or Chicago is.  In any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case you over look the abysmal academic record of Al Gore to criticize Bush.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You and your friends chant about Bush the son of Bush and ignore Gore the son 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Gore or Kennedy the son of Kennedy and the brother of Kennedy &amp; Kennedy.
</em><br>
<p>Ireelevant.  There are many useful idiots - useful to those out 
<br>
to do great harm intentionally or not.  A comparison between 
<br>
them is pointless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Then you toss this in &quot;What is this &quot;we&quot;?  You will sit this one out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to age and cheer other &quot;boys&quot; on to their death in a more senseless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict than even Vietnam was.  Bully for you.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        As to Vietnam that was debated extensively on this list recently and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another person documented that all the documentary support for the North 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnamese position was a lie.  In turn all of your position is based on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lie told by the North Vietnamese.  However that lie was more attractive to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you than the truth told by your own country.  If David Horowitz is to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believed he and some friends of his organized the peace movement, never lost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of it, and led folks like you around by the nose.  According to Mr. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Horowitz it was all intended to be harmful to international position of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States.
</em><br>
<p>Again, utterly and completely irrelevant.  It was a senseless 
<br>
war from the beginning fought in a truly senseless and horrific 
<br>
way.  It doesn't take a great deal of analysis to smell the 
<br>
napalm or count the number of friends and friends and friends of 
<br>
friends who came home in body bags or with minds and bodies 
<br>
twisted and mutilated out of shape or to note that the &quot;for 
<br>
what&quot; was highly speculative and ill-defined at best.  The 
<br>
&quot;international position of the United States&quot; is laughable when 
<br>
it bankrupts the country for such a senseless exercise.  We the 
<br>
people do precisely what we are supposed to do when we notice 
<br>
such or notice such brewing again and say &quot;HELL NO&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;        As to your remarks about sitting the war out.  I am a hawk.  I do have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a DD214 as requested yesterday.  But you have no idea what ever what goes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the mind of a silver haired hawk.  You know only to grab a handy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogan that you can shout in front of your private Amen chorus.
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a damn if you are a &quot;hawk&quot; or not.  If you are 
<br>
advocating killing a lot of people, ours and theirs, for 
<br>
bullshit reasons then you are advocating evil and I will loudly 
<br>
and persistently say so.
