<p>Granted.  The composition of molecular clouds and the interstellar medium
<br>
will be different -- the question is *how much different?*.  The &quot;bubble&quot;
<br>
we inhabit is seems likely to be depleted of almost everything.  This would
<br>
seem to be a characteristic of real &quot;bubbles&quot; where high energy UV radiation
<br>
and supernova explosions have pushed much of the material away from former
<br>
high density cloud (star-forming) regions.  So the element make-up of
<br>
solar systems become really a question of whether you formed a low-mass
<br>
(e.g. solar mass) star early in the history of a star-forming high density
<br>
cloud (i.e. you by and large get interstellar abundances) or late in the
<br>
history of a star-forming high density cloud (in which case you get the
<br>
interstellar abundances &quot;contaminated&quot; by the recent SN ejecta from high-mass
<br>
short lived stars (e.g. those exploding after only ~100 M years).  I think
<br>
that there is a some evidence that the 2nd case may be more valid for our
<br>
solar system.
<br>
<p>However, I don't believe these scenarios impact Li quantities significantly.
<br>
Most of the Li in the universe was created during the big bang.  I believe
<br>
that brown dwarfs and stars primarily consume it rather than create it.
<br>
So its on a downhill abundance path until we start breeding it in (very)
<br>
large quantities.  The ratios of Li in the Earth's crust and oceans show
<br>
that concentration effects can significantly transcend the initial conditions.
<br>
<p>My primary point was to show that Kuiper belt objects, lacking many of the
<br>
&quot;concentration&quot; effects, may have more &quot;natural&quot; abundances and those abundances
<br>
may not be &quot;ideal&quot; for constructing technologies that are required for plutino
<br>
colonization.  As a result one may need inner solar system mining and/or
<br>
inner-to-outer solar system material transport capabilities to be able
<br>
to effectively colonize the outer solar system.  Either that or one has
<br>
to come up with a fusion cycle that can utilize relatively abundant fuel
<br>
(H/D only?) and doesn't require Li for an extraction of the energy generated
<br>
if one has any hope of utilizing the resources of the Kuiper belt anytime soon.
