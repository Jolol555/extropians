<br>
that we supported for a lot of years as long as Saddam was going after those

we wished him to.
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we never to be allowed to reverse a policy because it was wrong 
<br>
and to attempt to set our own wrongs right?  Is your allegation that we once 
<br>
followed thus and so a policy to render us impotent to act for all time?
<br>
