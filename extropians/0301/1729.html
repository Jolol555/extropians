</em><br>
<p>Okay, good point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Your contention that any kind of speech must be supressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, waitaminute. I said &quot;unlimited lying&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, speech.  Lying is speech.
</em><br>
<p>Only true, if all speech would be lying - which is, according to my 
<br>
observations, not true :-) Lying is a subset of speech. A rather useless, 
<br>
if not counterproductive subset IMO. Or to put it in Ex-Speech: a meme 
<br>
space polluting subset :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, that's exactly what I'm accusing you of--wanting to supress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false speech about yourself with force, rather than with competition.
</em><br>
<p>By the force of law and justice, because the power to win such a 
<br>
competition is often not with truth, but with the budget. Similarities to 
<br>
current political activities are not accidental...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Likewise, you can only damage my reputation among those who prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe you, and I am generally unconcerned about how I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived by them.
</em><br>
<p>Even if your neighbors, your employer or your local authorities would 
<br>
rather believe me than you? You could lose much of your competative power 
<br>
before you could even start to defense, just because one evil meaning 
<br>
person doesn't like your nose. Together with the imbalance of competitive 
<br>
power mentioned above, I'd consider this a substantial threat for example 
<br>
for minorities (like extropians).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It wasn't new laws that took down McCarthy, it was good reporting by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men of integrity and courage like Edward R. Murrow.
</em><br>
<p>Then why are still people believing in the &quot;real and present danger&quot; 
<br>
propaganda of Mr Bushs followers? Where is the good reporting about the 
<br>
present situation and the complexity in the middle east?
