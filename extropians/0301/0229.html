fifties were, like HUAAC, exceptional for their dedication to the truth.
<br>
##Gee Damien, where did that come from?  Have you ever read the newspapers of 
<br>
that day?  They ran Walt Kelly's attack on McCarthyism day after day.  I 
<br>
still remember the drum of attacks on McCarthy by my favorite SF magazine.  
<br>
The list goes on and on.  I'll bet the NY Times was editorizing like crazy.  
<br>
My papers in Missouri certainly were.
<br>
<p>&quot;Without taking a position, however, on the substance of Ron's comment, it 
<br>
would be interesting to know how many of those fleeing from atheistic 
<br>
communists were Catholics. If they'd been Scientologists or Heaven's Gaters, 
<br>
would the US newspapers of the mid fifties have been as sympathetic? 
<br>
##Damien, it would be interesting to notice if you paid attention to constant 
<br>
stream of reports of murder instead of seizing immediately upon the ad 
<br>
hominem argument that we were sypathetic to Roman Catholics.  Those people 
<br>
voted with their feet in hordes.  Do you suppose they were looking for a 
<br>
Roman Catholic Mass and if so why was it being denied them in the North?
<br>
<p>&quot;Would extropians, given the prejudice most of us share against delusional 
<br>
systems imposed in childhood under the whip of metaphysical fear and guilt 
<br>
upon the undefended?&quot;
<br>
## I also walked out of those churches as a young man but I was never 
<br>
whipped.  In my experience begging the question was the most flagrant thing 
<br>
they did.  And &quot;Undefended?&quot;  Damien, I used to love to debate those guys.  
<br>
What is with you?
<br>
Ron h.
