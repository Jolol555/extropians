<em>&gt; Hi Samantha :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Well, there are more than a few people around here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that believe in a sort of &quot;life after this one&quot; as they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;determined to support the creation of such possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;whether through cryogenics, uploading or such increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of capability without formally dying that the result is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;longer what most would  term &quot;human&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many would be wedded to the use of the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;belief&quot; in that sentence I wonder?R I.E. Would they be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to freely drop it and substitute it with another if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were convinced the word belief carried too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative baggage?R
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't think there is a tremendous value in simply changing the 
<br>
word employed.  I was attempting to point out that
<br>
<p>1) belief in an afterlife or something near magical (e.g. 
<br>
Singularity) is not confined to the religious;
<br>
2) such belief does not necessarily imply irresponsibility in 
<br>
&quot;the real world&quot; or at least the one we deal with now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or would insist that this one (this life) cease before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next once starts, rather than that this one would morph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with no loss of personal continuity in exchanging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrates?R.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Whatever.  It is a side question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The point of bringing this up is that belief in a life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;beyond this one, even of the more conventionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;religious kind, is not automatically a sign of serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;psychological problems and limitations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Serious psychological problems by the standard of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times, no, I agree. Limitations, I'm not so sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not altogether sure of this myself.  However, an opposing 
<br>
argument could be made that people who do not have belief 
<br>
pattern X have some limitations or will act sub-optimally for 
<br>
the good of themselves or the group in some situations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Even conventional religious folks often belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in and practice good stewardship of resources in this life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Now, it is true that many who do believe in an &quot;afterlife&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and even some that believe in some types of techno-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;transcendence, consider things of &quot;this life&quot; of not enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;importance to spend much time maximizing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, maximizing what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Things of this life&quot; was what I had (loosely) in mind. If 
<br>
someone believes that the Singularity is acheivable in say 5 
<br>
years and that it will make problems taking longer than this to 
<br>
unfold go away then it follows that they will not be so 
<br>
interested in addressing these longer range problems.  If a 
<br>
person beliefs say that this world is a place for overcoming 
<br>
their attachments to ego and phsycial earth life (as some 
<br>
religions do) then they wouldn't have much interest in 
<br>
maximizing those things logically or in improving many aspects 
<br>
of the physical conditions of humanity.  But most sets of 
<br>
opinions/beliefs about what is and is not important and the 
<br>
ranking of values will logically influence what one does and 
<br>
does not consider important and how one evaluates most issues of 
<br>
the day.  The effect is not limited to those beliefs one happens 
<br>
to despise or even to &quot;believing&quot; in the abstract.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Belief makes for bad social policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Personally I get a little tweaked by &quot;social policy&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You, tweaked? No. ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It smacks of collectivism and of centralized power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of some supposed limit on individual rights to come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;whatever conclusions or  beliefs by whatever methods
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they see fit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you find it in that form, and you reckon you can do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safely, smack it back ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I talk of &quot;social policy&quot; in this context I mean it quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply as the way social groups (societies if you will) make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions as to how to allocate resources amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, and what rights there should be that they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each undertake to accepts some personal responsibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for so that these rights are not just theoretical but are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually underwritten in practice by the free decisions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others in the social compact.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Unfortunately when some of the social group bring belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the supernatural into their considerations they can start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to imagine that the nexus between rights granted and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibilities assumed can be broken. That somehow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the supernatural underwriter is going to step in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if necessary societies can grant rights without its members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needing to merely confine themselves to real resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the real capacity of the society to underwrite those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that real rights are something granted by the 
<br>
society or that they must be paid for by duties/responsibilities 
<br>
to the society.  I do of course agree that it is foolish not to 
<br>
live in reality instead of fantasies.  But human rights are a 
<br>
mockery if they are merely what your tribe deigns to give you 
<br>
and determines the payment for.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Problem is when citizens try to rely on rights that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underwritten by real responsibilities they find those rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be relied on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I disagree strongly with your entire model of rights here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I need to get to know someone before I give them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the benefit of  the doubt as to having done either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;qualitative or quantitative analysis of any sort *if*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;they say they have arrived at a position based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;faith or belief.  Actually if the used the words
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;arrived at a position&quot; I'd probably raise my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;evaluation a bit. If they use another word instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; of believe,  like perceive, think, suspect etc.. I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; there's a better chance of some sort of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;processing going on. That they are not just parroting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;what they've heard. I guess I apply a crude sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Turing test to people. I suspect that some others that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;have a strong commitment to reason also make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;assessments on  the basis of language. Assessments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;which are not facts, but are definitely not mere beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Why should anyone care whether you approve of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;word they use for their process or not though?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well I'm no one particularly special, so let's be clear about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that. But to answer your question, perhaps one intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughtful person should care about what another intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughtful person thinks because their is a genuine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity to learn for both of them if one adopts that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You have your opinion but that is all the above is.  Everyone 
<br>
else, without being at all disrespectful or unreasonable, is 
<br>
perfectly free to disagree and act on their disagreement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As it happens I have spent quite a bit of time thinking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the use of particular words in the context of political debates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and do have some real world lobbying experience at quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a high level but I expect no way to take my insights or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience on faith. Rather I see it as my responsibility to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make my case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would counsel all who would listen not to accept things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say because I say them, (I don't want disciplines -like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd come looking for them here : -) - I want more friends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more colleagues, an extended community and more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with whom I can work to make the world a better place as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by us not just by me). I ask that people accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only what I say *after* consideration *if* it seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true and/or useful to them (and then only accept it provisionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until something better becomes available). But I'd also say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please be generous with *your* insights, thoughts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticisms with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;There is also the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;matter of a more inductive approach to certain questions of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and value.  For that matter, the entire sphere of values is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;easily reduced to that which reason alone recommends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly not easily. But as I hope has become a little more clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the course of this reply I am looking a reasoning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing very much in the context of what they mean for the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you can get much buy-in to a social compact that 
<br>
attempts to remove &quot;believing&quot; as such.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, perhaps some &quot;values&quot; in the &quot;entire sphere&quot; should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valued. Perhaps belief should not be valued. I don't value it. I value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (even believers). I respect their right to have opinions and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use words like belief. But I don't currently respect belief as such, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think its anti-social at worst and a-social at best.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That you have made clear.  But I am not convinced belief as such 
<br>
and in all areas can be avoided.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I certainly won't willingly contribute to the view that belief is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;good and as valid a way of making decisions in the world as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;reason. It isn't. Indeed promoting such a misconception in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;democracy increases the chances of my premature demise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;When you have employed reason and cannot reach a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but you have to choose, what do you do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I make a provisional assessment, or if need be a final assessment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as dictated by the need to reach a decision as best I can given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I expect you &quot;make a value judgment&quot; that at least seems unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to be certainly wrong and seems to be mostly in the direction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the rest of your values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know about the value judgement bit, but a judgement yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I aim for more than &quot;unlikely to be certainly wrong&quot; this end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ranging is usually despatchable quite quickly (it depends) but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also look to a judgement on what is &quot;more likely to be right&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Please do consider ditching &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;beings&quot; from your operating language when other terms are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm talking again as a political animal, not merely or mainly a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;philosophical one. I am pursuing change and very aware of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;important it is to win the votes on issues in democracies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It is not important.  The votes are a game generally to persuade
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the people they actually are in control.  The counter-evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is easily found.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand this comment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Voting is becoming a charade that really effects nearly nothing 
<br>
imho.  The government is generally out of control of the people. 
<br>
Having the people vote even super-rationally will not imo likely 
<br>
be sufficient to bring it under control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry just in case that was missed, the pivot point on embryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;stem cell research around the world at present (politically)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;speaking is whether an embryo is a human being. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;it is. It exists and its human. Its not a person though. So if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;don't want to propagate and validate the confusion we'd better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;use the term person and people and personhood or some such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;equivalents when we mean them instead of the less precise terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;or we are running the risk of helping believers giving us social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;policies whereby actually persons (sick people) cannot be given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;the fullest level of care, because we've traded off their rights as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;a class against the rights of some potential people (embryos) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;a class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;A good point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thank you, I've worked on it and I continue to work on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;However, it would be MUCH better to remove stem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cell research and development from that which is subject to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;vote&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can tell me how we can do that in practice Samantha I'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very interested to here it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Reimpose strict Constitutional limits on what the government has 
<br>
any right to stick its nose in.  Exactly how we would get there 
<br>
from here is a very good question.  It is also one I think we 
<br>
better put some considerable effort into answering.
