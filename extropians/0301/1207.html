<em>&gt; Sir,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathies are entirely with those young hawks that are serving in our

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You like Samantha wish to use these pages to spout slogans instead of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to understand what is going on.
</em><br>
<p>To which Samantha responds:
<br>
<p>&quot;Do you think that you are inside of my head, &quot;sir&quot;? Do you 
<br>
believe for a moment that you understand the deep abhorrence I 
<br>
felt from watching the horror of Vietnam, what it did to this 
<br>
country or those who came back mangled in body, mind or spirit 
<br>
many of whom I knew and dealt with personally?&quot;
<br>
<p>I, for one, don't claim to be inside your head. I don't think Ron thinks he 
<br>
is either. So, I will ask you now to flat out elaborate fully on your 
<br>
position. What about what the Indochina Wars did to the peoples of Vietnam, 
<br>
Cambodia, and Laos? They would count their blessings to have only been 
<br>
mangled in body, mind, or spirit. Yes, 58,000 Americans lost their lives in 
<br>
Vietnam. They should be forever honored and remembered. But millions died in 
<br>
the aftermath of the United States' withdrawal! More people died in the first 
<br>
two years of the communist &quot;peace&quot; than in the entire eleven-year conflict to 
<br>
prevent the communist takeovers. Do these Asians that lost their lives in the 
<br>
worst human hell imaginable not count? You have repeatedly ignored inquires 
<br>
by myself, the Mikes, and Ron on this point. Why don't you do us all a favor 
<br>
and state out loud that you don't care about those who died in Indochina so 
<br>
we can stop pestering you on it.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Do you imagine 
<br>
for a moment that you utterly understand and appreciate that I 
<br>
honestly and deeply believe that Iraq and the general never 
<br>
ending &quot;war on Terror&quot; is a dreadful and deadly danger to all I 
<br>
and we hold dear?&quot;
<br>
<p>I think everyone understands that you feel the &quot;war on terror&quot; and potential 
<br>
military action against Iraq are inappropriate courses of action. However, I 
<br>
think it also obvious that not everyone here shares your views on what we 
<br>
hold dear. 
<br>
&quot;Iraq is only a beginning, an early &quot;domino&quot;, 
<br>
but the attitudes behind this war must be faced and dealt with 
<br>
as early as possible. To you really characterize this deep 
<br>
caring and committment to what we claim to believe in as using 
<br>
these pages merely &quot;to spout slogans&quot;?!&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, I think one can accuse you of that until you actually address factual 
<br>
arguments against your position, which you currently seem loathe to do.
<br>
<p>Max
<br>
<p>&quot;At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with 
<br>
America and little that is right.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
