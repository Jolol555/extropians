<em>&gt; with this in the long run, the level of education between the rich

</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference in intelligence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from middle and upperclass communities. With many current systems of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education I can't see how this problem can be resolved.
</em><br>
<p>In the early 20th century in the US, most students attended private
<br>
education, either through private schools in their own neighborhood or
<br>
through home schooling. The literacy rate then was far higher then than
<br>
it is now, and high school students learned subjects like calculus,
<br>
latin, and Shakespeare as a matter of course, not as an exception. 
<br>
<p>The problem with America's education system has been specifically
<br>
perpetrated by public financing and management of it by government. For
<br>
example, the literacy rate among blacks was far higher in 1950 than it
<br>
was in 1990. This is a direct measurement of the impact of public
<br>
education on the poorest and most marginalized Americans.
<br>
<p>The founding fathers warned that the diseducation of the citizenry
<br>
would destroy the republic, and the only way this has happened is at
<br>
the hands of those with the greatest special interest in perpetrating
<br>
ignorance in the populace.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In America something has to be done. If the richest country in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's education system is constant turning out a large percentage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of stupid people than how will any progress occur accept very slowly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the top 1% of the very intelligent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think?
</em><br>
<p>I think it is an interesting dichotomy that the US primary and
<br>
secondary school systems, which are predominantly publicly financed and
<br>
managed, are considered the most dismal in the industrialized world,
<br>
producing the worst product, with the highest dropout rates.
<br>
<p>At the same time, the US university system, however, is considered the
<br>
best in the world and is predominantly privately financed and managed.
<br>
It produces the best graduates, with the best training, in the world.
<br>
<p>Given this, how can you continue to claim that public is better than private?
