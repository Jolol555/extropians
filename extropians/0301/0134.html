<p><em>&gt; I've read the piece Damien refers too as well.  Lyle Burkhead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks to me like the sort of guy you might need to be careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you were seen (or more likely overheard talking with)
</em><br>
<p>That's right.  Guilt by association is alive and well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but on the whole based only on his writing he comes across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me as a likeable and intelligent guy wrestling as many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent folk do with ways to make progress and to improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his own and the &quot;human condition&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Nothing, of course, is wrong with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can imagine his sort easily beneath the... broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; umbrella of transhumanism I'd approve of.
</em><br>
<p>Are you approving of the notion that someone with such
<br>
radical ideas be allowed to be called a transhumanist?
<br>
If so, I agree.  Do you agree with him or approve of
<br>
his viewpoints?  I don't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I still think it's legitimate to consider differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between groups and races.
</em><br>
<p>What do you believe is illegitimate to consider?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As it happens its not my area of interest but it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invalid per se, or so far as I can see anti-transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per se to question whether there are racial differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are significant.
</em><br>
<p>Now, invalidity is another matter altogether!  Many will
<br>
reasonably claim that supposing that there are racial
<br>
differences is as invalid as supposing that the sun
<br>
goes around the Earth.  They are perfectly entitled to
<br>
their opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also I'm not sure I'd want to be connected to a belief system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either, I like Max More's approach to belief systems, as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand it.  Beliefs are too [sic] be avoided if possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and minimised when not - hence PCR. 
</em><br>
<p>I think that it's a weird misuse of language to 
<br>
suppose that beliefs should be avoided.  Just what
<br>
are you trying to say?  (I too, am a big fan of PCR,
<br>
as are many Extropians.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...I can empathise both with those who are concerned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to [harm] a good &quot;brand&quot; like ExI, and yet I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worry that if criticism, even constructive criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is limited only to those minor matters that even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; casual reader of the list would not find challenging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the health and vibrancy may not be able to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieved.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite well put.  The best extropian thinkers have
<br>
from the outset endorsed this view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...not all newbies to extropian thought will be intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lightweights and if the material content gets too low or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sanitised these folk may actually be discouraged rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than encouraged.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... the fact remains there are strong forces in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community acting against the memes and objects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians and we need robust forums to counter those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces and marshal pro-active extropic responses of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our own.  If this list goes too far down the path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being a place for casually interested potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropes to sample the fare without being put off,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it may become less of a forum of interest to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians willing and able to marshal &quot;political&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action however gently that word is interpreted. 
</em><br>
<p>I think that this has already occurred.  I already know
<br>
of conversations about extropian topics that have had
<br>
to be taken off line because of the &quot;image&quot; it was felt
<br>
necessary to show the world.
