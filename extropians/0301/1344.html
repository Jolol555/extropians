<br>
<p>Max,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might consider reading some of their military writing.  Back ten 
<br>
or fifteen years ago the British magazine ran an analysis of China and its 
<br>
military plans for the future.  I remember the copy clearly as it had a 
<br>
picture of a Chinese soldier lying prone and firing a bipod mounted machine 
<br>
gun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article cited the Chinese saying that they would no longer try to 
<br>
engage in mass tactics.  Instead their new strategy was to build up their 
<br>
industry and their economy to the level where they could afford to build a 
<br>
new modern Army and Navy.  In order to accomplish this they intended to 
<br>
reduce the offensive capability of their Army for a few years, save that 
<br>
money and use it to build their economy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that article they gave away their entire long term strategy.  They 
<br>
didn't cut back their defensive capability, only their offensive capability.  
<br>
When they develop their new modern Army they will restore their offensive 
<br>
capacity.  They seem to be on schedule and to have gone a long way toward 
<br>
rebuilding.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max continued, &quot;The problem right now is that we in the west needs the 
<br>
oil from the middle east. This means that we cannot do what is morally 
<br>
right.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;## Max this is what I have been trying to say.  You are not prepared 
<br>
to do what is morally right.  You are frightened and your strategy is to 
<br>
placate the middle east no matter who you have to betray or what immoral 
<br>
position you have to take.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually things are a little better than you represented them.  
<br>
Europeans still show moments of shame, even moments of courage and a devotion 
<br>
to integrity.  I certainly don't think all Europeans are immoral or cowards.  
<br>
Your fighting men have proven their valor too many times for me to take an 
<br>
attitude like that.  Even during the bloodiest days of the Hitler regime you 
<br>
had men and women that were not afraid to do what is right.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor am I asking you to stand up, take arms and go dashing off to war.  
<br>
No one least of all the Americans need you to do that or would ask you to do 
<br>
so.  But Max, you can show your colors, you can be seen to be getting out 
<br>
that rusty old weapon you own &lt;VBG&gt; and oiling it up for use if needed.  You 
<br>
most certainly can quit trying to discourage those who are going in your 
<br>
behalf.  And you can pray to whatever God you acknowledge that the war be 
<br>
avoided if possible and if impossible to avoid that it be over quickly  with 
<br>
minimum damage to the civilian population as well as the American &amp; British 
<br>
troops that are in the area.
<br>
