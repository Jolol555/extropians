[me:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Heinlein felt insulted to be given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; contrary advice on his own soil about the actions of his own nation;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Clarke quite correctly spoke out in defence of us all, Americans and
</em><br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p>[John K Clark:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Interesting! What side was Clarke on?
</em><br>
<p>I don't have his biography with me, but as I recall his objections were
<br>
twofold: it wouldn't work, and it would dangerously destabilize the system
<br>
of mutual terror that had kept us safe until now (i.e. then). He was derided
<br>
by several space engineers in the meeting on the first point, but clearly he
<br>
hasn't resiled from it:

<br>
<p>&lt; &quot;As you doubtless know, I had a bit of a fight with my old friend Bob
<br>
Heinlein over this Stars Wars [SDI] business. I'm glad that the crazier
<br>
schemes - putting an umbrella over the United States, for instance, which
<br>
was utter nonsense - have vanished. Some of those more ridiculous notions
<br>
are now part of history. But there are quite a few things which we must
<br>
continue to do. It's a dangerous world and a lot of nasty people are likely
<br>
to have nuclear weapons and delivery systems, and I'm afraid a certain
<br>
amount of military application and study has to carry on.&quot; &gt;
<br>
<p>In a discussion of Greg Bear's EON, at
<br>
<a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/l.j.hurst/gbear.htm">http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/l.j.hurst/gbear.htm</a> , we find this account:
<br>
<p>&lt; In the Acknowledgement Bear lists the Citizen's Advisory Council on
<br>
National Space Policy (&quot;Citizen&quot; here means member of a small US right-wing
<br>
pressure group). An account of the CACNSP by Gregory Benford, &quot;Dancing With
<br>
the StrawMan&quot;, can be found in Far Frontiers vol V, Spring 1986. It details
<br>
how the group, of whom Benford was one, in the early eighties produced the
<br>
idea of SDI and sold it to the White House - &quot;Here was the President, using
<br>
phrases and ideas that first surfaced in casual swimming-pool talk less than
<br>
a year before ... But with a sinking feeling I heard Reagan envision a total
<br>
defence of our population&quot;. It goes on to describe how Arthur C. Clarke, who
<br>
was opposed to the pollution of space by weapons but whose early
<br>
astronautics work could be used in SDI, was attacked by the group -
<br>
&quot;Heinlein attacked as soon as Clarke settled into Larry Niven's living room
<br>
... Foreigners on our soil should step softly in discussions of our
<br>
policies, Heinlein said. Clarke was guilty of 'British arrogance'&quot;. So, in
<br>
the words of the Star Warriors, it will not protect even all the USA and the
<br>
rest of the world can go hang. &gt;
<br>
<p>Just so. On the second point, Heinlein was clearly out of order; this was
<br>
not a matter for USians alone, it had the capability of capsizing the whole
<br>
international balance of power. I believe Clarke `apologized' to calm
<br>
Heinlein down, but not because he felt he'd been wrong in making this
<br>
important point on Homeland soil.
