In a message dated 1/15/2003 3:19:36 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20About%20&quot;rights&quot;%20again">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a> quotes Jefferson: &quot;Under the law of nature, all men are 
<br>
born free, every one comes into the world with a right to his own person, 
<br>
which includes the liberty of moving and using it at his own will.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And corrects Jefferson: &quot;It is patently false that humans are born 
<br>
free or with a right to his or her own person.  They are entirely helpless 
<br>
and in almost all cases are totally under the control of their parents.  
<br>
Indeed, even as they age, in most cultures they observe that the liberties of 
<br>
moving or using their own persons are severely curtailed; why, even in our 
<br>
own they find they cannot ride motorcycles without taking care to place the 
<br>
government's head in a safety helmet.  And we're among the best, historically 
<br>
speaking.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is that true?  All of us here know perfectly well that we may not 
<br>
have had freedom of speech back in the seventh grade if confronted by the 
<br>
playground bully.  We almost certainly didn't have freedom of speech at the 
<br>
dinner table if our parents were determined to raise children fit for 
<br>
civilized company.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Jefferson was not speaking in that context and he most 
<br>
certainly was not ignorant of the many ways a government can become 
<br>
dictatorial.  He very simply was setting forth the reasons we as adults had 
<br>
for demanding to live according to certain rights and what those rights were 
<br>
in general.  I say in general because in the process of ruling ourselves we 
<br>
would determine the specifics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have commented before (long since) upon the work of Clare Graves and 
<br>
his hierarchy of values.  Clare Graves Hierarchy of Values was an extension 
<br>
of Maslow's Hierarchy made necessary by Maslow/s incompleteness.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Graves work religion and religious thought accompanies and changes 
<br>
at every level of the hierarchy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that Jefferson was operating at a certain level of 
<br>
thought in discussing religion.  As this seems to be about my own level of 
<br>
thought on that subject I am comfortable with what he has to say insofar as 
<br>
one man ever understands another.  In my estimate Jefferson, etal, have 
<br>
passed the fundamentalist level and have come to do the very things the 
<br>
fundamentalist holds as hateful -- they are questioning everything the 
<br>
fundamentalist holds as certain.  To do this is a natural progression of 
<br>
religious growth.  You might compare this to the scientist that having found 
<br>
out that F=MA goes on to test the limits, search for the exceptions, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do believe we sometimes misunderstand those founders 
<br>
(Lincoln included) when they discuss religion or make comments in a religious 
<br>
context.  The disbelievers usually object to what would be a level four 
<br>
religion in Graves' Hierarchy.  I think they are correct to do so.  Level 
<br>
four is of course the fundamentalist churches whether they are Christian, Jew 
<br>
or Moslem.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the nonbeliever makes the mistake of becoming a level four 
<br>
atheist and seeing everything in terms of rejecting the fundamentalists.  
<br>
They most especially are totally unwilling to recognize the existence of 
<br>
anything else.  Therefore thinkers like Jefferson, Washington or Lincoln 
<br>
(there are many more) are misinterpreted or are the source of confusion.
<br>
Ron h.
