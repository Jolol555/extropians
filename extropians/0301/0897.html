<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It does indeed. The US could lose the war, for instance. Saddam's

</em><br>
<p>Not just superior air power.  We also convinced our opponent that we would 
<br>
attack directly into Kuwait from the Saudi border and the sea, while 
<br>
instead we went around his defensive line by going through southern Iraq 
<br>
and looping down.  The whole campaign really reminds me of the Axis 
<br>
invasion of France.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;1. Saddam distributes his army in the cities, basically hiding behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children and women. The US forces would need to fight for each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every house. Is the US prepared for another gorilla war after Vietnam?
</em><br>
<p>The Viet Kong were motivated and had secure supply bases in the North.  The 
<br>
Iraqis shouldn't have either; in fact their morale will probably be even 
<br>
lower after having been defeated 10 years ago, and knowing that prisoners 
<br>
were treated well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;2. The US forces get too lax and make a mistake. Iraqi ground forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;launch a fast attack on Saudi/Kuwait territory, forcing the surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US forces into a large scale ground battle?
</em><br>
<p>That could happen, and it would produce quite a few casualties, but even 
<br>
with our reduced military we should still be able to fight them off.  What 
<br>
would be scary would be a chemical attack on our staging areas, but we did 
<br>
take substantial precautions last war and I'd imagine we're doing so now.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;After a first success there might be other Arabian leaders joining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war on Saddam's side and suddenly we have the war here in Europe. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hate to see Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW produce robots-of-war instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of luxury cars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is because we believe that, if Saddam does not yield,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action may eventually be the least awful necessity for Iraq, for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Middle East and for the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;.... since awful oil prices like we have now are not good for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economy. Bombing Iraq into the ground will lead to plenty of orders
</em><br>
<em>&gt;after the war. Siemens can sell a pro West Iraq all the nuclear power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plants they don't need and Lockheed can rebuild the Iraqi air force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All payed with cheap oil. Wonderful.
</em><br>
<p>As has been stated, Saddam would be happy to let us do all that anyway in 
<br>
return for lifting sanctions.  This has been better discussed in previous 
<br>
posts than I can do.
