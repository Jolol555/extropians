<p><em>&gt; Therefore, the only intelligent idea of Mr. Bush so far has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;coalition against terrorism&quot;. He now is going to destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this coalition for no sensible reason.
</em><br>
<p>Which has been highly problematic from the very beginning.  One
<br>
group's terrorists are somebody else's freedom fighters.  See the
<br>
pained faces in the Western countries when the Russians immediately
<br>
hopped on the train, pointing to their own fight against terrorism
<br>
in the shape of the war in Chechnya.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Iraq topic has nothing to do with &quot;terrorism&quot;. Not even the Bush 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime has yet found a connection between radical islam and Hussein.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is an important point.  Hussein is a secular ruler who
<br>
would own a top spot on the list of enemies of radical Islam if he
<br>
didn't play to anti-Israel and anti-USA sentiments as expertly as
<br>
he does.
<br>
<p>The USA looks like a powerless giant.  They have this currently
<br>
unrivaled military machine but there is no targetable enemy.  Poor
<br>
Hussein, who--as abominable as he may otherwise be--appears to be
<br>
innocent of any involvement with the affairs of &quot;Al-Quaida&quot;, must
<br>
suffer as a substitute.  Or so it occasionally looks from here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want to hear my guess: There's no profit to win by attacking those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others. Iraq has the second largest oil resources currently known. A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puppet regime in Bagdad would guarantee a good profit to all those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multi-billion dollar companies who heaved Mr Bush into his office with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the largest campaign contributions ever seen.
</em><br>
<p>I think attributing this to corporate interests is a bit too
<br>
short-sighted, but clearly geopolitical interests are at stake here.
<br>
<p>We're told that the country that currently offers the most support
<br>
to radical Islamists, including terrorists, is Saudi-Arabia, which
<br>
also has a rather unpleasant leadership that does not share Western
<br>
values at all.  However, Saudia-Arabia happens to be the leading
<br>
supplier of petroleum, still has the largest proven reserves, and
<br>
has followed a foreign policy course that has as hypocritically
<br>
played to the West as Hussein does the opposite part.  American
<br>
bases in S.A. are also important for the US military presence in
<br>
the Persian Gulf region.
<br>
<p>Replacing the current Iraqi regime with a pro-Western one, puppet
<br>
or otherwise, would very nicely remove the US dependence on the
<br>
uneasy ally Saudi-Arabia and would in fact allow to put the squeeze
<br>
on that country.  At least that's my take on the situation.
<br>
<p>Hussein may be a murderous dictator, slaughtering his own people,
<br>
bound on gaining &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;, but he was quite
<br>
welcome to do so when he served as bulwark against Iran's brand of
<br>
radical Islam.  Claiming to remove Hussein because of his evilness
<br>
is hypocritical.  On the other hand, those who object to US power
<br>
politics but want to see international justice administered can't
<br>
ignore the fact that Hussein deserves being whacked.
<br>
<p>I guess there would hardly be any international resistence against
<br>
a commando raid sweeping down and capturing or killing Mr. Hussein
<br>
and a couple of his bodyguards.  Alas, this seems impractical and
<br>
the alternative approach of a war against the state of Iraq suggests
<br>
that removing Hussein will also entail killing another 100,000 of
<br>
his subjects who are supposed to be liberated from under his rule.
<br>
Ouch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US are not going to war for moral, ethics and democracy - or not any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed.  It would be so much nicer if the US government, as well
<br>
as the American nationalists loudmouthing on this list, would stand
<br>
up and declare:
<br>
<p>1. We pursue our own interests.
<br>
2. We are the fucking leading military and economic power on this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planet, we do as we please because we can.
<br>
<p>Instead we get all this gobbledygook about (supposedly objective)
<br>
good and evil, ethics, democracy, freedom, bla, bla, that is
<br>
inherently troublesome and so obviously at odds with actual policy.
<br>
<p>(Not to mention that I find Mr. Bush's persistent references to
<br>
&quot;God&quot; in his rhetorics eerily similar to those of Mr. Bin Laden.
<br>
This is a point where American sensibilities diverge sharply from
<br>
European ones.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And sorry, it would be total foolishness to risk a years long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uproar of the whole middle east and many more terrorist attacks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for reasons like that.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's far from clear that leaving Hussein in power will be
<br>
less deleterious.  The whole area is so fucked up, we just don't
<br>
know.
<br>
<p>Now let me suck up in part to the kill-em-all-crowd here and annoy
<br>
their opponents by pointing out that I'm neutral on the issue of a
<br>
US war (with or without British and French support) against Iraq.
<br>
Apart from the oil price, I'm not personally impacted.  It will be
<br>
just another video clip war, pretty pictures on TV of people blowing
<br>
each other to smithereens.  It's not me dying out there, nor anybody
<br>
I'm close to.  And I sure as hell can't do anything about it either
<br>
way.
