I know it's not a popular topic to reignite, so I'm not going to correspond any further on this, but living in Victoria and having received some comments on guns deaths/law and order (which I didn't pursue too far then once I became aware this debate has become counterproductive) I still have to mention in light of the Ollie North letter and reply as to its urban myth status, the snopes site also mentions Victorian gun deaths as a false myth of the urban variety.

<p>Excerpt:
<br>
<p>Then we have the claim that &quot;In the state of Victoria alone, homicides with firearms are now up 300 percent.&quot; This is another example of how misleading statistics can be when the underlying numbers are not provided: Victoria, a state with a population of over four-and-a-half million people in 1997, experienced 7 firearm-related homicides in 1996 and 19 firearm-related homicides in 1997 (an increase of 171%, not 300%). An additional twelve homicides amongst a population of 4.5 million is not statistically significant, nor does this single-year statistic adequately reflect long-term trends. Moreover, the opening paragraph mixes two very different types of statistics -- number of homicides vs. percentage of homicides committed with firearms. In the latter case, it should be noted that the Australia-wide percentage of homicides committed with firearms is now lower than it was before the gun buy-back program, and lower than it has been at any point during the past ten years. (In the former case, the absolute number of firearm homicides in Australia in 1998-99 was the lowest in the past ten years.)
