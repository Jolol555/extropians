</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; with her special rich idiosyncratic way of being-in-the-world?
</em><br>
<p>That's a great question.  It very well illustrates the complex issues
<br>
involving reproduction.  And again, rather than immediately asking whether
<br>
we should permit this in others, first ask what we would do in her shoes.
<br>
In this situation the answer may seem obvious, but as Damien goes on to
<br>
show, there are variations where things are not so clear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stress at once that this is a thought experiment; I don't know of any tragic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victim of thalidomide who would consider for a moment doing this to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human. But we know that many congenitally deaf or dwarfed people are eager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do the equivalent.)
</em><br>
<p>That's very true, this issue has arisen already in certain communities.
<br>
What seem to outsiders as deformities and limitations are seen by them
<br>
as characteristics that define their way of life.  We had some good
<br>
discussion here a few months ago when there was that TV show about a
<br>
couple of different deaf families that were debating whether to correct
<br>
their children's hearing with cochlear implants.
<br>
<p>It's not a simple issue.  And looking forward, what happens if everyone
<br>
else starts enhancing their children with some kind of neural interface
<br>
that makes them seem inhuman?  Is it really wrong for someone to say
<br>
that they want their kids to grow up the same way as their ancestors
<br>
have done?  It might not be Extropian, but I think we can all recognize
<br>
the discomfort that someone would feel if they knew their children were
<br>
going to be fundamentally unlike them, foreign in some way.
<br>
<p>For a good example of this, see the story by list member Charles Stross
<br>
and boingboing.net editor Cory Doctorow, &quot;Jury Service&quot;, which they
<br>
generously put online at
<br>
<a href="http://scifi.com/scifiction/originals/originals_archive/stross-doctorow/stross-doctorow1.html">http://scifi.com/scifiction/originals/originals_archive/stross-doctorow/stross-doctorow1.html</a>.
<br>
The image of the bulging brain-enhanced three year olds was a bit much
<br>
even for me to take, alternating between rolling around trying to grab
<br>
their feet and building a bootleg long baseline radio telescope out of
<br>
their smart wallpaper.  I wouldn't necessarily want my kids to grow up
<br>
like that, even though I might be handicapping them compared to the rest
<br>
of society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But is it easier to reach a personal or public policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion about such a case than it is for the imposition of what one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construe as mental deformities, via strict upbringing in preposterous or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmful memetic systems? And which of us should then 'scape whipping?
</em><br>
<p>I think this is in part where Lee Corbin is coming from, that if we start
<br>
forbidding people to have children with certain characteristics, we would
<br>
be on a slippery slope to banning any politically incorrect upbringing.
<br>
<p>Raising kids is a hard business.  I welcome discussion about how we should
<br>
consider the tradeoffs between possible enhancements and possible dangers.
<br>
How will we decide whether some new technology is worth the risks?  These
<br>
are questions which we can discuss productively in terms of what each of
<br>
us would choose, without having to decide what other people can do.
