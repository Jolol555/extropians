<p>Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I think we are more noble as Americans when we take our heritage
</em><br>
seriously
<br>
<em>&gt; enough to avoid entanglements all over the globe
</em><br>
<p>Michael Dickey:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As free people, do we not value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom, and in doing so, wish freedom upon others?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...] I do not understand your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that we have 'no business' going there (Iraq) as 'free people'?
</em><br>
Should we get
<br>
<em>&gt; in the habit of just not caring about people unless they are Americans?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I have a hard time imagining you honestly believing, that the Bush junta
<br>
wages war on Saddam because they want Iraquis to be free from oppression.
<br>
What a cynical joke and what a bitter laugh! The Iraquis happen to live on
<br>
the second largest and easy to access oil reservoir on earth. &quot;
<br>
<p>And if Oil were the only issue then why are we sitting idly by while a
<br>
corrupt dictator named Chavez attempts to nationalize and take control over
<br>
the Venezuela Oil production industry, of which we obtain some 1/3rd of our
<br>
imported oil from?  
<br>
<p>And so what if oil a motivational aspect of it, do you think free productive
<br>
societies should be able to use oil for the purposes of production, trade,
<br>
and creativity or corrupt despotic murderous dictators should be able to use
<br>
it to invade, oppress, and slaughter?  
<br>
<p>&quot;And here they go again: fucked up old men send their sons to die. Same old
<br>
disgusting story, same old fucking lies. And they managed to get you
<br>
brainwashed so meanwhile you probably believe, Saddam himself has initiated
<br>
the WTC crash.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course I can make the same exact statements directed toward you 'Same old
<br>
disguting story, same old lies, and they managed to brainwash you...&quot;  Etc.
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>&quot;Wake up. There is not a single noble motive behind this new attempt for
<br>
world domination.&quot;
<br>
<p>World Domination?  As you said &quot;I have a hard time imagining you honestly
<br>
believe&quot; that.  What is this world dominations goal?  To create democtratic
<br>
constitutional republic with market based economies throughout the world?
<br>
And where do you see a problem with this?  What do you believe this 'world
<br>
domination' goal is?  To create an oppresive dispotic dictator with Bush Jr
<br>
as the &quot;Ameriworlddictatorforlife&quot;?
<br>
<p>&quot;There are lots of dicators left besides Saddam,&quot;
<br>
<p>True enough, and I think as a humanist, an extropian, and generally
<br>
concerned about the value of life person you should support efforts to
<br>
remove such murderous dictators from power.  That have no moral
<br>
justification for existence and exist only as promulgators of death, hatred,
<br>
intolerence, murder, and every other anti-extropian value you can imagine.
<br>
Unfortunately the only murderous dictator that the current administration
<br>
can convice a majority of the general survivor watching liberal brainswashed
<br>
public that it is in our interest and humanities interest to dispose of is
<br>
Saddam.  Hopefully North Korea, argued by many to be the single worst
<br>
country on earth, is next.  
<br>
<p>Yet people like you who allegedly support freedom and human liberties
<br>
condemn him in his efforts to dispose of a murderous dictator, on what moral
<br>
grounds do you make such a condemnation?  
<br>
<p>&quot;while the US won't even think of invading their countries, because you
<br>
won't find any oil there.&quot;
<br>
<p>If Oil, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, a clear record of aggressive
<br>
foriegn policy, a clear hatred of the US and western values, and a racist
<br>
murderous dictator *still* isnt enough to convice members of the public,
<br>
such as yourself, that it is worthwhile to remove Saddam from power, how can
<br>
you expect the adminstration to use *only* OIL to justify the removal of
<br>
other corrupt murderous dictators?
<br>
<p>In one sentence you condemn the US and the adminstration for attempting to
<br>
remove such a tyrant from a position of power with all this evidence in
<br>
place and then in the next sentence criticize that same adminstration for
<br>
not removing other tryants from power over only oil.  
<br>
<p>It is clearly in the worlds best interest that free societies use energy for
<br>
productive reasons than letting murderous tryant dictators use the cheapest
<br>
most abundant source of energy for murder and tyranny. 
<br>
