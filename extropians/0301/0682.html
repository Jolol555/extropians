</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and Extropianism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If we leave out our dear ideas of weird
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forms of reproduction (cloning, polyparents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; xoxing, random generation), child-rearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and an economic unit and instead look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the family as a social institution, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the main property of the family is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strong altruist bonds that are commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; present. They can be explained socio-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; biologically as the result of selection for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kin altruism. This makes the family a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; network of trust and security (hardly every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; family, but enough to matter).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would not define family as such -- not as &quot;altruist.&quot;  I believe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confounding of &quot;altruism&quot; with family life here comes from the cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we live in and not any essential trait of families.  See below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, &quot;selection for kin altruism&quot; I'm not so sure.  You'd have to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the traits are genetically determined and variable.  I mean using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Horwitz's view of family, childless couples are families as would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couples with adopting children be.  Now, if they're selecting each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of some genetic trait they didn't directly inherit, the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still have to be proved.
</em><br>
<p>Yes Horowitz notion of the family is potentially quite broad. Many forms
<br>
of family he suggests can fulfill the essential functions. That children
<br>
don't
<br>
normally &quot;select&quot; their parents as I'm taking your meaning does not seem to
<br>
be particularly acknowledged by Horwitz as an axis of note.Yet it might be
<br>
important to the notion of understanding families and transhuman families
<br>
to recognize that voluntary membership by all can pertain more to some
<br>
family forms and than to others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism systematically problematizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the human condition, asking about every human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trait: &quot;How could it be different? Could it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better? Can it be changed?&quot;. In the case of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; family it is interesting to consider what happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if this altruism is removed or extended.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See above.  I don't see altruism as a defining feature here.  People do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often live together as families for mutual benefit.  The childless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple example -- which is, according to Horwitz, the dominant form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family -- comes to mind.  You might reply that I'm extending family and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit beyond useful definitions, but that was Horwitz's example in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former and I would point out that benefits can be long ranged and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-monetary -- both of which I'm sure you'd agree on. (I'm merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicating these for others to consider.  Others might point out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the egoist, family might be a very important value because she or he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has internalized the value of family.  That is, the good life for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an egoistic family person would include family and many of its attendant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demands -- just as the dude who loves his rare stamp collection might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make _provisional_ sacrifices for it.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, your questions are good.  I would add to this, since families
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spontaneously evolved, under newer conditions, while I might expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planning to play a role, the spontaneous ordering might continue along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different lines.
</em><br>
<p>Yes and further the proportion of members of families who have volunteered
<br>
to be members is likely to increase both as birth rates decline and as it
<br>
becomes easier for individuals to abandon dysfunctional families and seek
<br>
more functional alternatives. Not all in all families are active planners
<br>
either
<br>
within the family or in determining the families relationship with the wider
<br>
world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Non-altruistic families would be essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the kind of economic units described in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paper, producers of children, socialization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and economic interfaces. It doesn't sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very fun, and these functions could likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implemented by other market actors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See above.  I thought of the market absorbing family while I was reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the paper.  It would be interesting to see if this were possible and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would no longer be a family then, but a market order.
</em><br>
<p>Whilst certain functions of the family can be taken over by the market
<br>
the function of serving as the primary source of socialisation for infants
<br>
is going to be required as long as there are infants (standard biological
<br>
variety at least). Therefore if family forms are or can be fluid as Horowitz
<br>
suggests whoever or whatever assumes the role of providing an environment
<br>
in which infants are first socialised could be seen to be a family. If too
<br>
much
<br>
of this function of the traditional family is ceded to the market the child
<br>
will
<br>
simply experience itself to be in a dysfunctional family. If the market,
<br>
however
<br>
organised, does the primary socialisation well, it will, it seems, need to
<br>
involve
<br>
some primary caregivers or the infant will &quot;imprint&quot; on whoever is around
<br>
anyway. So although the child can't choose its form of family its wellbeing
<br>
and early dependency will continue to dictate that certain minimal
<br>
requirements
<br>
in the area of primary socialisation will continue. Whatever environment the
<br>
infant
<br>
finds itself in, whether created by the market or otherwise, the child will
<br>
react
<br>
to that enviroment as least in some respects as if that environment is a
<br>
functional
<br>
or dysfunctional family for its needs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, even with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the market, there are institutions, as Horwitz points out, that exist in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the market yet are somehow not exactly the same as a market, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firms.  Firms exist despite the fact that many economists believe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't.  (Frederic Sautet, on the other hand, argues that firms arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through entrepreneurial action in his _The Entrepreneurial Theory of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firm_.  But my point is not so much to labor this particular example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but to point out that the market might not absorb all social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions -- even ones specifically emerging from it.)
