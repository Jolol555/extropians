<br>
And I'll say it again - there's a link between religiosity and intolerance.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreed, But have you ever noticed that fundamentalism is an attitude.
<br>
There are a couple of different kinds of fundamentalists but basically it
<br>
comes down to absolutely knowing we have the one right answer.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that, if we look around we find fundamentalists and the
<br>
intolerant among Christians, Jews, Moslems and Atheists.  I think the rest
<br>
of us have some quantity of the agnostic or the searcher in our make up and
<br>
those also are found among every religious persuasion including those that
<br>
are not believers in any particular theology. &gt;
<br>
<p>Atheism is an outlook, not a philosophy (e.g., humanism) or political stance
<br>
(e.g., communism).  Atheists throughout history have ranged from Ayn Rand
<br>
(virulently anti-communist) to Mao (virulently statist), from the poets
<br>
Shelley and Coleridge to the early &quot;feminist&quot; Susan B. Anthony, from the
<br>
sweetest-of-humans Robert Ingersoll to the bitterest-of-dictators Stalin.
<br>
The only thing they all had in common is that they did not believe in a
<br>
supernatural being, but that doesn't say anything else about them, just as
<br>
the word &quot;atheist&quot; doesn't mean much beyond &quot;without god.&quot;   About all one
<br>
can say about atheists in general  (that is, when a whole population of
<br>
people isn't *forced* to become atheist because the government happens to be
<br>
officially atheist) is that nontheists tend to be better educated.
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note that in the former USSR - even when the country
<br>
was supposedly officially &quot;atheist&quot; - there remained a deep prejudice
<br>
against Jews (a leftover cultural tradition from the
<br>
Czarist/monarchist/godist times before the Bolshevik Revolution).  I heard
<br>
that even &quot;Soviet Jews&quot; had to state that fact - that they were Jews?
<br>
Atheist Jews? - on their identification papers or something (I heard this
<br>
from someone second-hand - please correct me if I'm wrong).
