<p>
I've already responded to Damien directly, and I don't want to duplicate
<br>
those comments here.
<br>
<p>But just a few quick points.
<br>
<p>I, too, Damien am a professional communicator. I spent four years getting
<br>
a journalism degree, have experience building prototype magazines and
<br>
worked during the Internet boom years in an intense business incubator as
<br>
an editor responsible for building a health portal. Among other
<br>
professional activities, I also guest lecture on Web writing and reporting
<br>
at Ryerson University in Toronto.
<br>
<p>I'm perfectly happy to have some people deeply dislike or even hate the
<br>
name &quot;Betterhumans,&quot; as well as other aspects of the Website. All we can
<br>
do is our best -- based on formal and informal research, and gut
<br>
feelings -- and everyone is entitled to an opinion. With a semiotician,
<br>
Shannon Foskett, as an associate editor, we are well aware of the meaning
<br>
in our symbols.
<br>
<p>But the name was chosen for a reason. When I went through the process of
<br>
creating it, I spoke with a deconstructionist, anthropologist friend about
<br>
what we mean by &quot;better.&quot; Her argument, of course, was that &quot;better&quot; is
<br>
culturally relative.
<br>
<p>My response to such statements is always something along the lines of
<br>
this: Does that mean we should be satisfied with sickness, poverty,
<br>
inequality, tyranny and all sorts of other things humanity has struggled
<br>
against throughout its existence?
<br>
<p>No. &quot;Better&quot; has meaning. I have no problem saying that we all want to
<br>
become better humans, or that we want to better humanity.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Simon Smith
