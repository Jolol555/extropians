AlterNet - The Obesity Gap
<br>
==========================
<br>
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=14913">http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=14913</a>
<br>
<p>According to Greg Critser's &quot;Fat Land,&quot; one of the few news stories to
<br>
break through the coverage of the previous day's attacks &quot;was one about
<br>
the latest obesity statistics (the national rate had jumped again – to
<br>
26 percent).&quot; Overweight will kill far more Americans each year than any
<br>
terrorist would dare dream of taking out, and Critser is rightly
<br>
incensed about the death toll racked up by cardiovascular disease,
<br>
hypertension and especially diabetes, along with all the other
<br>
fat-related illnesses.

Center For Advancement Of Health - Individuals' Medical Costs Rise With
<br>
Increasing Obesity
<br>
===============================================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.hbns.org/news/obesity01-10-03.cfm">http://www.hbns.org/news/obesity01-10-03.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>Overweight and obese individuals incur up to $1,500 more in annual
<br>
medical costs than healthy-weight individuals, according to a two-year
<br>
study of nearly 200,000 employees of General Motors.

New Scientist - Bone transplants growing success
<br>
================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993252">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993252</a>
<br>
<p>A remarkable surgical technique allowing transplanted bone to grow has
<br>
proven successful in reconstructing the hip of a four-year old girl.
<br>
Italian surgeons performed the operation in 1997, while removing a
<br>
life-threatening cancerous bone. They reconstructed the hip using a
<br>
graft of bone and blood vessels from the child's lower leg, along with
<br>
donor bone to support it. Now, nearly five years after the operation,
<br>
the bones are still growing and child can walking and swim.

New Scientist - Frequent drinking cuts heart attack risk
<br>
========================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993249">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993249</a>
<br>
<p>Half an alcoholic drink every other day, be it wine, whisky or beer, can
<br>
reduce the risk of heart attacks by a third, a new study shows. The
<br>
12-year study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found
<br>
that the frequency of drinking was the key to lowering the risk of heart
<br>
disease, rather than the amount, the type of alcohol, or whether or not
<br>
it was drunk with food.

NY Times - Scientists Discuss Balance Of Research and Security
<br>
==============================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/10/science/10SECR.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/10/science/10SECR.html</a>
<br>
<p>Leading scientists began talks here today on whether and how to withhold
<br>
publication of scientific information that could compromise national
<br>
security. The discussions at the National Academy of Sciences follow a
<br>
raft of post-Sept. 11 restrictions on research into some 64 substances
<br>
that could be used in biological weapons. The discussions were also
<br>
partly an effort to fend off potential government censorship or other
<br>
steps to control unclassified research that the new domestic security
<br>
law terms &quot;sensitive.&quot;..

Tech Central Station - Learning Your Limits
<br>
===========================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&amp;CID=1051-010903D">http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/techwrapper.jsp?PID=1051-250&amp;CID=1051-010903D</a><br>
<p>Just before Christmas, a San Jose, Calif., jury took the law into its
<br>
own hands and acquitted a Russian software company, Elcomsoft in the
<br>
first criminal case brought under the controversial Digital Millennium
<br>
Copyright Act of 1998. That act makes it a crime to offer products for
<br>
sale that circumvent digital copy protections. ElcomSoft agreed that it
<br>
sold software that did exactly that, circumventing protections developed
<br>
by Adobe against copying of its eBooks. But the jury may have bought the
<br>
testimony of the company's young programmer that his and ElcomSoft's
<br>
intent was innocent.&lt;br /&gt;

Betterhumans - Cheap Navigation System Will Open Consumer Robot Market
<br>
======================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-09-10">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-01-09-10</a>
<br>
<p>Just weeks after artificial intelligence researcher and futurist Hans
<br>
Moravec announced the completion of a robot vision system, a US startup
<br>
company has announced developing a robot navigation system that is cheap
<br>
enough to make consumer robots commercially viable.

BBC - Brigitte Boisselier: Scientific genius or PR guru?
<br>
========================================================
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2643445.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2643445.stm</a>
<br>
<p>As scientists wait for proof that baby Eve is indeed the world's first
<br>
human clone, BBC News Online looks at the woman who may or may not, have
<br>
created her. Dr Brigitte Boisselier was born in France and is a trained
<br>
scientist... Clonaid, which will not reveal where its facilities are,
<br>
was founded in the Bahamas in 1997 by the man who founded the Raelian
<br>
religious sect...

Reason - Don't judge reproductive cloning by the Raelians.
<br>
===============================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.reason.com/sullum/011003.shtml">http://www.reason.com/sullum/011003.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>It looks like the Raelians' cloning claims, like their founder's
<br>
revelatory 1973 encounter with extraterrestrials, will have to be taken
<br>
on faith. After initially promising genetic tests to prove they had
<br>
produced a baby with the same DNA as an adult donor, the followers of
<br>
Rael are now backpedaling.
