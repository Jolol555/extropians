&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be really nice if these could be mounted on tanks and 
<br>
made to detonate HEAT projectiles while they are still out of effective 
<br>
range (of the warheads's plasma jet that is, not the 
<br>
missile/RPG/shell).  Is it just me, or do modern tanks just cry out for 
<br>
point defense?  Why don't we mount mini-vulcans on tanks to shoot down 
<br>
incoming missiles?  Would the necessary radar or lidar be too vulnerable?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, it would probably we easier to charge a flywheel or 
<br>
capacitor for this off a tank or APC's engine than off anything on a cruise 
<br>
missile or jet; so I don't know why we're considering putting this defense 
<br>
on those platforms.  Maybe the engagement range for a microwave gun is so 
<br>
great that it would be wasted on ground vehicles that engage at relatively 
<br>
close range?  People with real experience with tanks, please tell me if I'm 
<br>
horribly wrong about anything.
