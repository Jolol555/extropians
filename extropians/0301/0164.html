Damien paraphrases my remarks about cattle by the
<br>
substitution of the term &quot;the Irish&quot;.  You sons
<br>
and daughters of Eire out there can tell him what
<br>
you think of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The Irish are better off being bred and slaughtered than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they would be if the British didn't bother raising them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I ask only that they be treated well before they're killed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the killing be done as painlessly as possible.  It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be a sad day for the Irish race when people no longer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to eat them.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I have always clearly maintained that people are to
<br>
be accorded special status.  Besides, your implied
<br>
history would be screwed up.  The British never
<br>
&quot;raised&quot; the Irish, they merely conquered them
<br>
and began denying them their freedom.
<br>
<p>But let's suppose that your history were accurate, and
<br>
that the British had given birth to the Irish race for
<br>
the express purpose of eating them.  Now we would agree
<br>
that it would have been better for the British to have
<br>
simply created the Irish with no strings attached.
<br>
Absolutely true.  Fine.  That's granted.
<br>
<p>But suppose we ask of a certain Terrence O'Reilly:
<br>
On the whole, taken as a package, was it good or
<br>
bad for you that this happened?
<br>
<p>You see the logic of my argument.  It is not rocket
<br>
science.  What is it about it that bothers you so?
<br>
(Besides that it &quot;smacks&quot; of this or that.)
<br>
<p>Can there not be a logical argument that supports
<br>
your point of view with respect to a real, particular
<br>
person?  Or must your feelings and intuitions remain
<br>
logically unarticulated?  And you're not alone; I'm
<br>
sure that there are millions who believe just as you do.
<br>
<p>Lee
