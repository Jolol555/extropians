<p>You won't even be close to fixing the major causes of death by 2010.

If by 2005 we fully understand how to isolate, cultivate and amplify
<br>
adult stem cells (pretty unlikely as well IMO), then you might begin
<br>
to make a major dent in the major causes of death starting around 2020
<br>
(at least in the well developed countries).  Even when you have fixed
<br>
the major causes of death, it seems likely that a host of new ailments
<br>
(akin to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc., i.e. late onset diseases)
<br>
will begin to appear as you start having more people push into their
<br>
110's, 120's, etc.  Those may require decades of study to unravel and
<br>
fix.

</em><br>
<p>Assembler technology is not required.  A path to manufacture real nanoscale
<br>
machines, e.g. real nanorobots, *is* required (I've discussed one in my
<br>
Protein Based Assembly of Nanoscale Parts paper).  The singularity is not
<br>
required either.  Significant increases in computing capacity will probably
<br>
make things go faster because it will speed up the semi-automation of the
<br>
design of nanoscale parts and the simulation of functional nanomachines.
