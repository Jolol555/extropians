<p>[...]
<br>
<p>The religious rhetoric and hectoring style of George Bush goes down
<br>
particularly badly in the secular, liberal societies of Europe. I share the
<br>
distrust of Bush, on whose face I am unable to discern a glimmer of wisdom.
<br>
I share the horror at the thought of one Iraqi child being killed in this
<br>
attack, should it happen. But it is here that I probably part company with
<br>
many in the peace movement. Because what if Saddam Hussein really is as big
<br>
a danger as they say he is, and continues to resist efforts to disarm him?
<br>
<p>In 1981 Israel bombed a nuclear reactor in Iraq. In 1990 Iraq invaded
<br>
Kuwait. In 2000, according to a British Foreign Office report, Saddam
<br>
approved amputation of the tongue as a penalty for criticism of him. The
<br>
same report - and this has been confirmed by Iraqi women I have spoken to -
<br>
says Saddam's army retains professional rapists. Saddam has had and has used
<br>
chemical weapons against his own people. The British Prime Minster, Tony
<br>
Blair, whom I am inclined to trust, says Saddam either has or is developing
<br>
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and would use them. Are we willing
<br>
to take the risk of him sending anthrax germs around the world?
<br>
<p>The trouble with deciding whether or not a war is just is that it is usually
<br>
only possible to know when it is over. Most people would now agree that
<br>
World War II (but not the Vietnam War) was a just war. What if Saddam is
<br>
just as dangerous as Hitler was?
<br>
<p>Estimates have been made that up to 30,000 people may be killed as a result
<br>
of an attack on Iraq. Experts warn of a conflagration in the region. The
<br>
possible consequences are indeed terrifying.
<br>
<p>But the truth is that even experts cannot predict what will happen. I have
<br>
recently been rereading World Conflicts, by Patrick Brogan, published in
<br>
1989. The author described Europe then as the most dangerous place on the
<br>
planet, because of the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union. He warned that
<br>
if all eastern European states demanded their freedom, the Soviet Union
<br>
could revert to &quot;Stalinist thuggery&quot; to restore its authority. &quot;It is most
<br>
unlikely that the dissolution of the greatest of all 20th century empires
<br>
will be accomplished peacefully,&quot; he wrote.
<br>
<p>Today the states of eastern Europe are getting ready to join the European
<br>
Union, old enemies France and Germany are preparing to share government
<br>
ministers, and Germany, still seen as potentially dangerous 15 years ago, is
<br>
perhaps the most pacifist country in Europe.
<br>
<p>I hope there is no war. I hope an indefinite presence of weapons inspectors
<br>
in Iraq may buy time enough for Saddam to either agree to go, or be
<br>
overthrown by his own people. If there must be force I hope it has the
<br>
authority of the United Nations behind it, and that it is quick, with few
<br>
civilian deaths (please, none).
<br>
<p>I hope for peace in our time. But not peace at any price.

<p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/31/1043804520192.html">http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/31/1043804520192.html</a>
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>&quot;So that's what people mean by a just war?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I guess so. A just war is when you have to defend yourself because someone
<br>
has attacked you. Or when a friendly country is attacked and its leaders ask
<br>
you to help them defend themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;So if America attacks Iraq and Iraq defends itself, that wouldn't be a just
<br>
war for America, but it would be for Iraq. And if Iraq asks one of its
<br>
friends to help it defend itself against America, that would be a just war
<br>
for the other country, right?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's not quite that simple, I'm afraid. There are such things as good guys
<br>
and bad guys, sweetheart. Saddam Hussein is a bad guy, so we don't think
<br>
anyone would be justified in defending him.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But if he doesn't attack anyone, how can invading his country be a just
<br>
war? According to you, invading another country would always be wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, usually, but, see, everyone thinks Saddam has these really awful
<br>
weapons . . .&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Worse than America's?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Not worse, no. But, well, because he's a bad guy, people think he might
<br>
decide to use those weapons against some other country some day, so America
<br>
wants to invade his country and destroy the weapons before he can use them.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Has he threatened to use them? Like, who does he want to attack?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;He hasn't actually threatened to use them against anyone in particular -
<br>
except the Americans, of course, if they invade his country.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And us? Aren't we going to invade Iraq, too? We sent some soldiers off last
<br>
week. I saw that on TV, too.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;No one really knows, sweetheart. We mightn't actually be planning to
<br>
invade. We might be just trying to scare Saddam into giving up his weapons.
<br>
We might be calling his bluff.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But if he isn't planning to attack anyone, wouldn't that mean Saddam won't
<br>
use his weapons unless he has to defend Iraq against an attack? So wouldn't
<br>
attacking him be the best way of making sure he does use his weapons?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That's logical, but I guess our government must think there's a huge risk
<br>
he will use them on, on . . . on someone else if we don't get in first.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Our life skills teacher said the end never justifies the means. Was she
<br>
wrong?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't know, honey, I really don't know.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;By the way, whatever happened to Osama bin Laden? I thought he was supposed
<br>
to be the world's number one bad guy. Is Saddam even worse?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;They're both pretty bad. They're terrorists, see? They both place a low
<br>
value on human life.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Hmm. Dad, are we still holding little children behind razor wire in those
<br>
detention centres?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We are, sweetheart.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;So are we good guys or bad guys?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Good guys, definitely. No more questions, OK?&quot;
