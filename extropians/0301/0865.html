<p>The only two places?  What about from 10km with a B747 ABL,
<br>
the airborne laser?  The laser carrying 747, equipped with
<br>
flares, chaff and radar decoys, with a fighter escort, would
<br>
give the attacker some real headaches, especially considering
<br>
he knows he only has 35 minutes to live after squeezing off
<br>
a missile.
<br>
<p>Missile defense is certainly a difficult problem, but we
<br>
should not declare it impossible.  We must deal with it
<br>
eventually, for the Muslim extremists would be tempted to
<br>
deliver a nuke by missile if at all possible.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the Muslim extremists could smuggle the
<br>
missile into the vast empty deserts of Afghanistan, and
<br>
fire it with nearly complete impugnity, for there is
<br>
little real threat of retaliation, and 6 dozen heavenly
<br>
virgins to be gained if the victims did bother to shoot
<br>
back.
<br>
<p>This strategy might be more compelling to them than a
<br>
suitcase TN device, for they perhaps would reason that
<br>
they might trigger a nuclear shootout between the American
<br>
infidels and the godless Russians, killing two very big
<br>
and wicked birds with one well aimed stone.
<br>
<p>In that grim scenario, the surviving rest of the world
<br>
eventually falls under brutal Muslim rule, resulting in
<br>
a dark age deeper than the one caused by the rise of
<br>
christianity in Europe, ending our fondest hopes of a
<br>
plentiful technofuture, of cryonics, of any semblance
<br>
of human rights, of a singularity, of peace.
<br>
<p>Missile defense is important.
