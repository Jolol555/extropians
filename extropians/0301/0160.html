</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree. And I feel like a newbie again swimming in data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read the post in the subject header for the first time this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning and liked it because I thought it was provocative and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakenly thought it was new. The misreference to Daisy the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clone had me perplexed though, I didn't recall any Daisy, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've followed that area reasonably closely, and read Wilmut 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; et als book &quot;The Second Creation&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, having gotten all excited about the possibility of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some genuinely thorough and constructive analysis I find the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material been gone over and therefore probably some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiercer minds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be reluctant to take it up again. What a bummer!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just read the link Greg refers to (above top), not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forensically, but close enough I think. I have to say, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather choose to say, (as a relative newbie to both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism and Extropian thought) it is *still* my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspicion that there is much in Toth-Fejel's criticisms that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be &quot;valuably&quot; considered. That's a vague statement I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know but I'm wrestling now in part with the bandwidth of the medium. .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike Greg Burch, I saw Toth-Fejels comments on first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression as constructive and coming from an independent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinker and ally not an opponent. I thought, &quot;Great! There's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing like criticism to make a good thing better.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the record Greg, (having now read your Dialogue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Concerning Transhumanist and Extropian Ethics) I'm with you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the theist/atheist dimension (unless you've changed your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind) but I don't think any, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correction all, of Toth-Fejels points, or anyone else's, when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are so well put together, can be summarily dismissed.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose I might have sheathed my rhetorical claws a little more, but I
<br>
sensed more negativity toward &quot;the transhumanist/Extropian tradition&quot; in
<br>
the entirety of Toth-Fejel's piece than any particular point he made
<br>
reveals.  This comes mainly from two items in his post.  First is &quot;the
<br>
Nazi move&quot; -- Having had my nose poked into transhumanism per se for a
<br>
decade (and far longer, without that label), I tire quickly of &quot;the Nazi
<br>
gambit&quot; when discussing human augmentation.  I find that it's almost
<br>
always not the expression of a thought-out analysis of questions raised
<br>
by transhumanist technologies, but rather is either a simple emotional
<br>
reaction or, worse yet, a conscious rhetorical ploy.  After all this
<br>
time, when I sense &quot;the Nazi gambit,&quot; I scramble all fighters and smoke
<br>
as many of the enemy's planes as I can.
<br>
<p>Second, it bothered me that Toth-Fejel quoted the Transhumanist
<br>
Principles and not the Extropian Principles, and also gave little (in
<br>
most cases) or no (in others) credit to the significant amount of
<br>
thought that's already gone into the questions he raised.  It's one
<br>
thing, like Fukuyama apparently recently has, to &quot;discover&quot; the concept
<br>
of transhumanism and be shaken by the implications, but not to be aware
<br>
that there's a group of really bright people who have been thinking
<br>
about these issues in depth for a long time.  It's quite another to have
<br>
done enough research to come across Anders' web site and the
<br>
Transhumanist Principles, but to still take the rhetorical position that
<br>
these Big Questions Need to be Addressed -- as if the author is a lone
<br>
voice sounding the alarm in the wilderness.  This was one of the things
<br>
that bothered me so much about Bill Joy's alarmism.  In this regard,
<br>
Toth-Fejel's piece exhibits just a pale shadow of the problems Joy's
<br>
jeremiad had: &quot;Oh no!  We're about to be able to change HUMAN NATURE!
<br>
Better be careful!&quot;  Taking the issues seriously on the one hand,
<br>
without acknowledging and dressing the existing literature on the
<br>
subject on the other hand, seems to me to be disrespectful of the people
<br>
who've devoted themselves to these questions at worst and superficial at
<br>
best.  Thus, Toth-Fejel's article triggered in me a desire to set the
<br>
record straight and let his readers know that there was a large body of
<br>
existing literature addressing the questions he raised.
<br>
<p>A last point also probably played a role in my reaction to Toth-Fejel's
<br>
article way back when.  When I read it, I did a little research on the
<br>
author and discovered that he is a devout Catholic.  That's fine and his
<br>
business, of course, but learning that made me question the sincerity of
<br>
the tone in the article in question.  How can someone who holds the
<br>
beliefs he does address the subject of the fundamental re-engineering of
<br>
human nature without mentioning the Big Guy in the Sky?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I read you paper &quot;Extropian Ethics and the Extrosattva&quot; a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of months ago and thought it was very good. I didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial response to Toth-Fejel was of the same high standard. 
</em><br>
<p>An authorial comment years after the fact: The two pieces were of a
<br>
completely different nature.  I took Toth-Fejel's article as a challenge
<br>
to some basic ideas I have developed after a lifetime of study and
<br>
thought, and wrote in my response with a much more rhetorically
<br>
aggressive and responsive tone.  The &quot;Extrosattva&quot; essay, on the other
<br>
hand, was an attempt to set out my ideas about ethics and morality in an
<br>
affirmative, &quot;stand-alone&quot; way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Partly so you know I've read the paper, but mainly because it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an unusual viewpoint and one I'm inclined to myself, I draw your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to a statement you made (its page 45 of 52 on my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; printout. Within Dialog part 1):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You said (then):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;(Unlike many transhumanists) I think an &quot;objective&quot; morality is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, and thus that moral axioms are not &quot;unprovable&quot; in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense that they are not derived from empirical observation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and experiment&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does Extropian Ethics and the Extrosattva represent your most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed thoughts or public thoughts on this subject?  I ask 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I want to know where the frontiers lie in your view 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and because I want to gauge whether new efforts in this area should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a priority. 
</em><br>
<p>It is my most developed public thoughts on the subject, because my
<br>
professional work in the last few years has taken me away from being
<br>
able to write about ethics at the level I'd like to be able to.  I've
<br>
certainly thought more about the questions presented there, and I can
<br>
say I haven't changed my views substantially: I still find that there is
<br>
a foundation in game theory and evolutionary psychology for an objective
<br>
morality.  Returning to the subject with the seriousness and commitment
<br>
it requires is one of my fondest desires, but I'm afraid I can't for the
<br>
time being.  I'd be very interested in work done by anyone else in that
<br>
direction!
