D. Broderick observed:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Oh, well, that must mean it's okay. Is Australia going to sit idly by
<br>
with every terrorist attack so long as the terrorists apologize
<br>
afterwards for those Australians who died as collateral damage? I mean,
<br>
to them, I am sure it is difficult to tell the difference between
<br>
Aussies and Yanks. We all look alike, and I'm sure they can't tell the
<br>
dialects apart. I'll even bet that there are t-shirt makers in Dubai
<br>
selling like hotcakes a design that says to the effect of &quot;Yanks,
<br>
Aussies, Brits, Kiwis? !@#% it, kill 'em all and let Allah sort them
<br>
out.&quot; So long as they apologize afterward, I'm sure it will be all
<br>
right.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, as you probably know, this behavior of our Canadian friends saved them 
<br>
some grief during the Vietnam War, and the Ayatollah takeover in Iran : 
<br>
&quot;We're not Americans, we're Canadians.&quot; Frankly, by lying, Americans who 
<br>
called themselves Canadians, saved themselves a lot of grief too. As this war 
<br>
against Islamic Militancy heats up, I suspect your contention that the 
<br>
Muslims will become uniformly, and openly anti-Western, may come to pass. 
<br>
This is what I suspect most Europeans think and why they are against American 
<br>
retaliation. &quot;You're fucking-up&quot; our business relations with the Middle 
<br>
Easterners..&quot;
<br>
<p>D. Broderick concludes:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Makes me think of a Monty Python-like skit:
<br>
<p>Scene: Ex-Pat British fellow in tweeds, sitting at a Paris cafe and
<br>
drinking tea while reading the morning edition. A crook walks up to the
<br>
cashier, shoots him and loots the till. The bullet ricochets off the
<br>
espresso machine, knocks the tweed cap off the Brit, and shatters his
<br>
tea cup. The crook abasedly apologizes for ruining the Brits suit and
<br>
paper, that he was aiming for the Frenchman. The Brit says, &quot;Oh, thats
<br>
quite alright. I was planning on getting it replaced anyway, and you
<br>
only meant to off the Frog, besides.&quot; They both go on their way with a
<br>
handshake and a nod.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, this is where a 800 foot long Vole comes and and says: Dinsdale!
<br>
Or :I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok, I sleeps all night and I works all day..
<br>
Nyeeh!
