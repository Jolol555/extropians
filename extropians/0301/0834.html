D. Broderick asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Did the attack on the WTC scare your nation so badly?
<br>
Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, but probably not enought to take the devil by the horn(s).  
<br>
To prosecute this war one needs to identify the prime enemy, which happens to 
<br>
be militant Islam. The president, and all current presidents are in the habit 
<br>
of kissing Wahabbi ass, to an incendiary degree. The deaths of 3000 Americans 
<br>
on 9-11 was not too dear a price to pay for saudi petroleum. Alas.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Meanwhile, US citizens are slowly being leached of their traditional
<br>
liberties. How can free people allow this to happen?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We're being slowly leeched because of the lack of political will, to force 
<br>
the conflict onto Islamic lands, where the issue originates. I note with 
<br>
glee, that France inexorably Islamist policies have not blunted attacks 
<br>
against the French, or their oil tankers :-)  
<br>
<p>Consider that the next surprise attack of consequence, may indeed be an 
<br>
enhanced fission weapon, sold by Kim Jong IL of North Korea, to Al Qeida and 
<br>
its Wahabbi funders (not just Saudis), and detonated in the docksides of San 
<br>
Diego, or near Los Angeles, or  San Francisco. Kim, of course, may be 
<br>
retaliated against, but if Washington, DC is targeted, then whence cometh the 
<br>
order to strike back? What if Kim denies having anything to do with such a 
<br>
strike, and what if he is correct?
<br>
<p>I would direct all interested parties to this Philadelphia Inquirer article 
<br>
about theorist, Peter Gale, for elucidation on the threat of Islamic terror. 
<br>
Thoughtfully cache'd by myself for your convenience.

<p>nation/3586541.htm+Peter+Gale+Terrorism&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&lt;/A&gt;
<br>
<p>***In 1998, University of Pennsylvania political science professor Stephen 
<br>
Gale went to Washington with a warning.He told Federal Aviation 
<br>
Administration security officials that terrorists might seize airplanes and 
<br>
fly them into some of the nation's most prized landmarks. Two he mentioned: 
<br>
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.No one listened, he said. An FAA 
<br>
security official told him that scenario fell into the category of threats 
<br>
the government is powerless to stop - like meteorites.Gale walked out 
<br>
furious.    ****
<br>
<p>and..
<br>
<p>***An attack on buildings where the nation's electrical grid is balanced, for 
<br>
example, would disrupt health care systems, shut down computer networks, and 
<br>
disable fuel pumps, all part of the &quot;essence of modern life.&quot; It would 
<br>
create, he said, the &quot;endgame&quot; in which &quot;we're done.&quot;&quot;There ain't no nation 
<br>
no more,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll splinter into a whole bunch of regional segments 
<br>
that are just going to figure out how to survive. That's it.&quot;We have all 
<br>
sorts of efficiencies built into our system. And the flip side, the dark 
<br>
force of efficiency, is vulnerability.&quot; ***
<br>
<p>I once stated that when the war comes to the Aussie mainland, many 
<br>
Australians will first blame America for getting it involved on the war on 
<br>
terror, and thus making Australia a victim of Islamic &quot;rage.&quot;  I, indeed, 
<br>
encountered this, right after the Bali attack, in a Yahoo chat. 
<br>
<p>The threats need to be moved back to Islamic lands where the problem 
<br>
originates. Because they can't play well with others, or can't adapt to 
<br>
modernism very well is nobodies fault.   But the threat is serious and the 
<br>
aggression, needs to be dealt with seriously.  If W wants to undermine Iraq 
<br>
as a first step to easing reliance on the House of Ibn Saud, this is not an 
<br>
issue for me. 
<br>
<p>Finally, we do need to work on an energy policy, that does not include 
<br>
petroleum from Islamist states.
