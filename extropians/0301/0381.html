<p><em>&gt; The above assumes that reason alone is sufficient for all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things.  But some quite fundamental philosophical decisions, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the Primacy of Matter vs. Primacy of Consciousness, are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not decidable on the basis of reason alone.  They are at a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly axiomatic level not further reducible.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is also the matter of a more inductive approach to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain questions of life and value.  For that matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entire sphere of values is not easily reduced to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which reason alone recommends.
</em><br>
<p>Hear, hear!  IMO, reason is completely incapable of
<br>
establishing values---reason can do no more than 
<br>
explore the consistency of values.
<br>
<p>Now, that being said, it still says a lot!  Obtaining
<br>
consistency throughout a value system is hardly simple.
<br>
Today we are met with any number of examples in the
<br>
news that severely tax outmoded systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If the extropian dumbs down his/her language in such a forum to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; include the uncritical word belief and thereby justifies by implication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the view that beliefs are as good as reasons, the extropian has handed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over a large part of their natural advantage. The listener(s) hear both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the extropian and the extropian's adversary talking in terms of belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and may get the message that as both sides are talking about beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they may as well choose whichever uncertainty they like. Hell vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the better looking politician, or the tall one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not agree and it is not part of Extropian Principles that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are or should be limited to &quot;reasons&quot; alone.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that would be impossible as well as unwise.  Still,
<br>
Brett does have a point.  Even in values, it is unwise
<br>
to say &quot;Blah, blah blah, and blah.  This is what I BELIEVE!&quot;,
<br>
e.g., &quot;It is horrible and obscene and cruel and therefore
<br>
WRONG for a woman to cut the arms off her daughter, and THIS
<br>
IS WHAT I BELIEVE&quot;, completely shutting oneself down to further
<br>
critical inquiry and pursuit of consistency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be better if our democracy was actually a republic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the majority of people had no right at all to &quot;vote&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a great number of things interfering with the freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals and groups.
</em><br>
<p>...so long as the freedom of one individual or group
<br>
does not trespass the freedom of other citizens.  (Of
<br>
course, it is the decision as to how broad citizenship
<br>
should be construed, i.e., whether or not it should
<br>
include fetuses, trees, rocks, babies, children,
<br>
white people, women, GAIs, aliens, etc.)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, it would be MUCH better to remove stem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell research and development from that which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject to a &quot;vote&quot;.
