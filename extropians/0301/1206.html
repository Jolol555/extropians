<p><em>&gt; [The U.S.] First world? Maybe by some technology and financial power, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither by political standards, nor by credibility of its government. A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president not elected by the majority of the voters, the voting system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faultier than once in east Germany, power-shortages like in Siberia, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human rights non-existent if you unfortunately become suspect of certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crimes, big brother around the corner and in the sky, ... I'd rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say: A threshold country on its way back into the middle ages - only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with TV.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you are exaggerating, perhaps deliberately for 
<br>
effect.  What mainly distinguishes so called &quot;first world&quot;
<br>
countries is rule of law.  Second is economic and technical
<br>
progress, and a close third is form of government (where 
<br>
this is independent of the most important &quot;rule of law&quot;).
<br>
<p>California had some severe power outages six months or 18
<br>
months ago (I forget).  On exactly one (1) day my company
<br>
had to be shut down mid-day because of it.  I didn't happen
<br>
to be affected by it at all at home.  Quite a number of
<br>
people suddenly had to pay much higher utility bills (i.e.,
<br>
as if suddenly the power plants were being run on European
<br>
gasoline rather than the American priced stuff).
<br>
<p>&quot;Human [legal] rights&quot; are still fully protected for all
<br>
citizens, except for statistically insignificant cases
<br>
that definitely occur in large ( &gt;100M ) countries.
<br>
<p>&quot;Big Brother&quot; happened in Orwell's book, and occurs in
<br>
North Korea, Turkmenistan, Cuba, and a few other countries,
<br>
but no longer occurs even in Russia or China---China is
<br>
too big, for one reason.  So is the U.S.  I have heard
<br>
more serious allegations per capita about Norway than
<br>
about the U.S., and even there, your statements are
<br>
greatly exaggerated.
<br>
<p>(I used to object to those who claimed that the Soviet
<br>
Union was in reality a third-world country.  Those anti-
<br>
communists simply failed to consider the tremendous
<br>
cultural and technological achievements of that so-called
<br>
&quot;third world&quot; country.  Their ideology also impaired their
<br>
thinking, evidently.)
<br>
<p>A country going back to the middle ages?  The intensity
<br>
of your feelings is interfering with your perception of
<br>
reality, big-time.  Perhaps you need a vacation.  In
<br>
California.
