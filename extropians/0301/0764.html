<em>&gt; &gt; Do you believe that claimed is based on other than your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preference?  [Yes]  If so, then what is that basis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as I've mentioned, our modern Western nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are able to confer greater benefits on their citizens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not from stealing from other countries, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through greater capacity for organized production and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is what &quot;natural rights&quot; are to Mike Lorrey:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Natural Rights are those legal liberties which the evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of human culture has demonstrated provide superior selection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of both the individual and the society in which the individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resides. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps many would agree with Mike's, so please observe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he's quite wrong:  human culture has *not* demon-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strated that these legal liberties provide superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection, survival, and so on (except quite recently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and for just a few people).  These legal liberties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are a property of our civilization, not our DNA.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still a massive epistemological error, IMO, to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imputing these &quot;properties&quot; of sentient beings as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being in any way independent of the historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation in which the human beings find themselves.
</em><br>
<p>These legal liberties are rules in which darwinian and lamarckian
<br>
evolutionary agents (of which both types operate deterministically
<br>
according to the embedded laws of physics) interact. It's not just our
<br>
DNA, its our memes as well, our accumulated knowledge.
<br>
<p>The purported 'historical situation' human beings find themselves in is
<br>
also dependent upon the characteristics of physics, but it is also
<br>
merely a selection effect, much like it is a selection effect that life
<br>
found it easier to evolve on the surface of a terrestrial planet like
<br>
Earth rather than others like Venus or Mars, or Jovian worlds like
<br>
Jupiter and Saturn. 
<br>
<p>You are making a massive epistemological error of imputing the cause to
<br>
these boundary condition selection effects rather than the more
<br>
operative underlying rules which govern behavior no matter what point
<br>
in history a human being finds themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When, lastly, I wrote on this subject, I mentioned six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books I've read or re-studied recently that deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I think are the relevant themes.  They were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Knowledge and Decisions, by Thomas Sowell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The Origins of Virtue, by Matt Ridley
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The Fatal Conceit, by F.A. Hayek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Power and Prosperity, by Mancur Olsen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The Mystery of Capital, by Hernando De Soto
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Carnage and Culture, by Victor Davis Hanson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I now find that I could name another half dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemingly relevant works that also fail to contain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;natural rights&quot; or &quot;natural law&quot; in the index.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't matter. The air exists for us to breath, so it's existence is
<br>
taken as assumed. You don't need to recite such basic concepts and
<br>
rules in order to build upon their validity (though apparently for some
<br>
readers, it seems one must).
<br>
<p>I'll note that you seem to be cherry picking your books. For example, a
<br>
more important work of Hayek is &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, in which he does
<br>
endorse concepts of natural rights.
