</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks Lee. I'm no programmer, webmaster or sysadmin, but I've had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some experience in managing an IT consulting co including the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure aspects. I think that in saying the cost is essentially zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are not including cost of skilled time (such as yours) to set it up.
</em><br>
<p><p>You'd get that on a volunteer basis.  Wiki is *not* a major thing to
<br>
set up.  Sure, you need a Web server to run it on: say, the one that
<br>
already serves www.extropy.org.  (As Lee said, the ExI board would
<br>
have to give permission for this.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I think we also need to take into account that some skilled time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and a *physical presence* is required somewhere - maybe near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ExI server? - to ensure backups etc are made) and for ongoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintenance and support at some level. I.e.. There would perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to be someone willing to be do some moderating (perhaps like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer does with SL4.org). Any volunteers for say a three month trial?
</em><br>
<p><p>The level of maintenance needed would be less than is needed for this
<br>
mailing list.  Technical maintenance is zero: keep the Web server
<br>
running, which is already needed, and this system doesn't add anything
<br>
to that.  Content maintenance is performed by the users directly, that
<br>
being the whole point of the system.  (Yes, things that agree with our
<br>
principles can, from a certain point of view, be seen as simply &quot;the
<br>
most economically efficient way to do things&quot;, due to economic effects
<br>
that are expressions of the reasoning behind our philosophies.)  See
<br>
Wikipedia for an example of this.
<br>
<p>Which raises the question: why do this on our own, less publicized
<br>
resources, instead of just contributing to the maintenance of
<br>
non-solely-Extropian but agreeable-to-Extropian projects that will have
<br>
a wider impact?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I reckon there were about 5 or so extropes who said they were interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an ExI wiki complementary to the ExI list. I don't recall anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many would be enough for the project to move from a  concept to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's-give-it-a-go-thing?
</em><br>
<p><p>I would, save that I dislike wasteful duplication.  I already contribute
<br>
to Wikipedia (occasionally, granted, and only on topics I am fairly
<br>
certain I know well).
