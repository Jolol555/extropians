&lt;&lt;Seeing there's so many war postings, here's another one. &quot;In August, human 
<br>
rights groups praised a Supreme Court injunction against Israeli soldiers 
<br>
using Palestinians as protection in raids on suspected Islamic militants.
<br>
The court on Tuesday amended the ruling to say soldiers could use 
<br>
Palestinians if the Palestinians agreed.
<br>
While the military denies using Palestinians as human shields, journalists 
<br>
have documented the practice.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Its sure is entirely possible that this occurred. But then many &quot;journalists&quot; 
<br>
had reported that Jenin was leveled, and thousands slaughtered. This was 
<br>
demonstarted to be propaganda, even by the scumbags in the UN. 
<br>
<p>I have come to doubt the veracity of &quot;news&quot; from all sources, and have 
<br>
decided to analyze as best I can; motivations, actions, and eventual results. 
<br>
If the eventual results do not add up, something has been misreported, at 
<br>
best; or I have been lied to, at worst.
