<p>Thanks!

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Anyhow, about the price of oil, one big factor in price is taxes.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surprise there. However I suggest that the relationship might be a little
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; price goes up. Perhaps, perhaps not.  Here is my reasoning:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; i.    Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally rise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iii.  Alternatives to oil-based products appear a little cheaper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;       I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;       driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; iv.   Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; v.    Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vi.   To maintain revenues, oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; (*) Of course they could increase prices but remember there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; really is a free market at work in the oil arena.  If one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; producer increases price they are likely to see market share
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; fall.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That sounds how the equilibrium should work, theoretically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One has to ask, why didn't they drop the prices a little to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; begin with, and sell more?  The answer should be, &quot;because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would have been slightly less profitable.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, so far you have increased the tax on oil, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; key has to be in your step (vi).  It's not clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the oil producers *can* maintain the same revenue. Consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reductio ad absurdum:  if an incredibly heavy tax were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied, then production would have to stop altogether.
</em><br>
<p>Pardon my limited education; reductio ad absurdum - take to the extreme? 
<br>
True, they probably cannot maintain the same level of revenue. I'll try an 
<br>
explain my thoughts again: Imagine two, competing, oil producers A and B, and 
<br>
a consumer C. C has added a windfall tax to crude oil imports and over time 
<br>
consumption of oil has declined slightly. A and B both see revenues decline 
<br>
in response. Now, assuming that the cost of production is only a tiny 
<br>
fraction of the sales price of the oil then A and B both stand to make a net 
<br>
gain in revenues by reducing prices slightly and undercutting the other. Say 
<br>
A cuts their price by 1% and C shifts 10% of its oil purchasing to A. A has 
<br>
gained 9% in sales at an expense of 1% in price. B sees this and responds 
<br>
accordingly. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I don't understand (vi), because I don't see why the oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producers wouldn't have increased production in the first place,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given that they do have at their disposal your option (vi) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintaining the same revenue at lower price.
</em><br>
<p>I think I need to change (vi) to read &quot;In an attempt to maintain revenues by 
<br>
increasing volume oil producers reduce price in a price war against other 
<br>
producers&quot;. Hmmm... I admit I still need to think about that one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now, assume for a minute that the increased tax revenues taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in by taxing the oil are used to displace some other tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (yes, yes, an unlikely scenario). Then:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a.   The nation sees no net change in the tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b.   The nation sees a net decrease in the price of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; c.   The oil producing country has a little less income from oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now you are saying that the &quot;oil producing country&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the same as the hypothetical country taxing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consuming the oil.  But if we are talking pure economics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, why should that matter?  You have also, by taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this route, introduced the possibility of international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition:  by taxing the incoming oil, the consuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country's products may be less competitive over all.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it really shouldn't matter and according to Henry George 
<br>
(www.henrygeorge.org) it would behoove us to tax natural resources (including 
<br>
land) instead of taxing income inside our own country. And yes, you are 
<br>
right, there might be unintended consequenses such as less competitive 
<br>
products etc. My focus is only on the taxing of oil imports and the price. If 
<br>
sustainability and a long term focus is what is important then I suspect that 
<br>
taxing oil imports would overall be a good thing. However I don't deny that 
<br>
that may come at the expense of some present wealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In short, I've gotten very confused!  ;-)  Mind starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over?
</em><br>
<p>As many times as it takes! I'm not too supprised at your confusion. It is 
<br>
very hard for me to write clearly and it wouldn't be the first time I've been 
<br>
asked to expain myself again. :) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The net effect: a reduction in the price of oil from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the nation's perspective.  I.e. by taxing crude oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an oil-importing country can trim some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; windfall profits from the oil exporting country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Windfall profits *going* to the oil exporting country&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I take you to mean.  But &quot;windfall profits&quot; don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretically take place because:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For the above reasoning I am not considering transient effects. Transient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effects and unintended consequences might include things like decreased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; economic activity, political unrest, me having to sell my beloved gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guzzling SUV etc...
</em><br>
<p>My turn to be a little confused. We know windfall profits take place just by 
<br>
taking a look at the money being made by the oil producing nations from oil 
<br>
sales. That money is not the result of human labour(*). What is the 
<br>
theoretical connection you wish to point out between windfall profits and 
<br>
transient effects?
<br>
<p>(*) Labor: Brain power and or muscle power applied to some productive end.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A fun thought experiment eh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, quite.  Such thought experiments may allow me to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how all this works!  Thanks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The best evidence in support of this argument are some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the strong statements the oil producing countries (especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; OPEC) make against consumer countries taxing oil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, of course they would make such statements.  But isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reductio argument above enough to see why?  Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments *could* simply tax incoming oil so greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it can't be imported at all except for those industries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that use it in only very small quantities.
</em><br>
<p>Yes a country could tax oil imports to zero but that seems like a silly 
<br>
choice. Assuming my reasoning holds water then the wise thing to do would be 
<br>
tax at a level that allowed only a few percent of the windfall profits to 
<br>
return to the oil producing nation. Keep in mind also that my reasoning 
<br>
relies heavily on the presumption that the oil consuming nation uses the 
<br>
revenue to displace other taxes. That effectively means that the consumer in 
<br>
that country sees no net change in their cost of living *dispite* oil 
<br>
products having increased in price.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your thought provoking questions Lee!
