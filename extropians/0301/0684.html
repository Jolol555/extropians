<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now, the phrase &quot;natural rights&quot; packs a lot of meanings, I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; afraid, that I don't know much about.  I once tried to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussion going here about that, in which some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural rights advocates would offer an explanation suitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for a materialist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you don't know much about them then it seems pretty pointless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and inflammatory to claim they are &quot;mythological&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>It isn't inflammatory when you are questioning the *existence*
<br>
of something.  For example, I don't know much about Shiva or
<br>
Chaugner Faugn, but I consider them mythological.  I have yet
<br>
to be shown a good enough case (so far) to change my mind 
<br>
about their existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not consider the simple fact that human beings have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific nature as mythological.  Given a specific nature I find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it difficult to escape the corollary that that nature implies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain requirements in settings with their fellow beings for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best functioning.
</em><br>
<p>Independent of culture and history, now?  Yes, I am the
<br>
first to agree that there is a human nature---there have
<br>
indeed many objective commonalities discovered in almost
<br>
all societies.  Edward Wilson was the first with &quot;incest
<br>
taboo&quot;, but there have been many since.  The early 20th
<br>
century notion that anthropologists could discover
<br>
*anything* about us has been thoroughly debunked.
<br>
<p>But that's still a far cry, IMO, to divining some kind
<br>
of &quot;rights&quot; from all this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the only &quot;real&quot; rights are legal rights, the invention of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some society or other, then on what grounds would you object to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inventions of some societies as opposed to the inventions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others?  On what grounds would you call a society &quot;evil&quot; re 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its treatment of its citizens?   How do you define what a &quot;good&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society would be like and what &quot;legal rights&quot; it would promote?
</em><br>
<p>Most excellent questions!  Due to a happy confluence of (what we
<br>
ordinarily think of as) highly ethical treatment by a government
<br>
coincides with what makes that society very competitive.  But
<br>
advanced thinkers, e.g. Mancur Olson &quot;Power and Prosperity, Outgrowing
<br>
Communist and Capitalist Dictatorships&quot;, have known for decades that
<br>
(a) the security of individual legal rights (b) economic prosperity
<br>
(c) large amounts of social and economic freedom (c) technological
<br>
advancement (d) enormous regard for private property,  all go together.
<br>
<p>So in a careful discussion, we might avoid notions like &quot;good&quot; and
<br>
&quot;evil&quot;, though its extremely tempting when considering ancient and
<br>
modern states that treat people terribly.
<br>
<p>I find that arguments about the Singularity even clinch the above,
<br>
because it gives a direction to time and history more powerfully
<br>
than old allusions to &quot;progress&quot; did.
<br>
