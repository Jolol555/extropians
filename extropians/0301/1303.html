Alice in Wonderland, a.k.a. the present writer, asked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just desserts? For what crime touching directly on the US?
</em><br>
<p>and thought of MINORITY REPORT, PhilDick/Spielberg's vision of a world where
<br>
people were punished for crimes they might later commit, a toxic circularity
<br>
which led me to recall a passage in STRIPED HOLES:
<br>
<p>====
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human people living in Australia during this time frame were protected in a
<br>
number of useful ways from doing things that might have caused them injury.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, they were not allowed to purchase &quot;hard&quot; mind-influencing
<br>
drugs because to buy heroin, Ecstasy or LSD made, distributed, and sold in
<br>
accordance with the Pure Foods Act would have worked atrocious ruin upon
<br>
their moral fiber.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the rather small proportion of human people who wished to use
<br>
these substances were encouraged by the government to break into other human
<br>
people's private homes and remove all the portable objects they found there,
<br>
especially cell phones, notebook computers, video and DVD machines, and then
<br>
take them down the road to shops where they could be exchanged for drugs. If
<br>
the residents objected, the shit was to be beaten out of them until they
<br>
ceased objecting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this might seem a long-winded procedure, it had a number of
<br>
immediate benefits. It inspired a welcome spirit of enterprise in the
<br>
community of drug users. This spirit had been badly sapped in other quarters
<br>
by the unchecked spread of the welfare or &quot;nanny&quot; state.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It increased the market for new computers and DVDs, while ensuring that
<br>
those people who could not afford new machines did not have to go without.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It meant that police officers could supplement their inadequate incomes by
<br>
helping run this arm of the chamber of commerce without adding to
<br>
bracket-creep or otherwise encouraging contumely toward the demands of the
<br>
Taxation Department.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best of all, it led to the swift deaths of many of the human people with an
<br>
appetite for drugs, whose injected supplies could now be fortified without
<br>
social censure with crippling bacteria, AIDS viruses, strychnine, ground
<br>
glass, and other additives. This was desirable because most of the human
<br>
people living in Australia at that time detested the drug fanciers for their
<br>
hatefully heedless habit of bursting unannounced into non-drug-using
<br>
people's homes and taking away, after first beating the non-drug-using
<br>
people shitless, all the portable goods the original owners had worked long
<br>
and hard to purchase.
<br>
<p>=======
<br>
<p>Is there an analogy of some kind lurking here? Perhaps.
<br>
