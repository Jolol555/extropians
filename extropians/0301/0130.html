Another cloned baby born, Clonaid says
<br>
Associated Press
<br>
<p>Amsterdam — Clonaid, the company that said last week they'd produced the 
<br>
first human clone, announced Saturday that a second such baby has been born, 
<br>
this time to a Dutch lesbian couple.
<br>
<p>Neither baby has been confirmed to be a clone by genetic testing, and 
<br>
mainstream scientists are skeptical of the company's claims.

<br>
<p>Clonaid spokeswoman Nadine Gary said in a telephone interview the child was 
<br>
born Friday night, but declined to say where.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's true that a second baby has been born,&quot; she said. &quot;The parents have 
<br>
Dutch nationality, but they are not in Holland.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ms. Gary said that she expects the second baby will undergo genetic testing 
<br>
to show it is a clone, with DNA identical to that of its mother. But 
<br>
Thursday, chemist Brigitte Boisselier — Clonaid's chief executive and top 
<br>
scientist — said the parents of the earlier baby were balking on testing.
<br>
<p>The company had promised DNA test results to confirm their claim by the end 
<br>
of this week. Independent scientists say the test should only take a day. In 
<br>
television interviews, Dr. Boisselier has said the parents of the second 
<br>
baby wanted to remain anonymous.
<br>
<p>Spokeswoman Gary said that, while the parents are Dutch, the birth did not 
<br>
take place in the Netherlands.
<br>
<p>Dr. Boisselier is a member of the Raelians, a religious sect that believes 
<br>
beings from outer space created life on earth.
<br>
<p>Scientists have successfully cloned pigs and sheep, but the technology is 
<br>
not reliable and most scientists say it is difficult, unethical and risky to 
<br>
attempt to clone humans.
