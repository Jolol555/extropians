<em>&gt; &gt; So I think that some form of technological community

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be very beneficial to the transhuman community at this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The integration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between ExI boards and mailing lists is a first step in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a technology point of view. What I have in mind would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;all places are one place&quot; ilk:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it would be a terrific idea to have one big &gt;H site, with news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and articles, that we all coorporate on. And if such a site will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into existence I am willing to support it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I am afraid that it is a doomed idea to make one site to cover it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all. We are all very much individualists, and so want to do our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing our own way. So we all want to be site owners.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Exactly. My suggestion was not for one big &gt;H site -- there is no central
</em><br>
repository in the plan, just a central clearing house with no associated
<br>
site. My suggestion is a way for everyone to be able to build their own
<br>
individual sites, and still have the big &gt;H community output on that site.
<br>
So every new site can do its own thing and still incrementally add community
<br>
to the whole.&lt;
<br>
_________________
<br>
<p>I tend to agree with Max M and Reason.  Since there is no central
<br>
authorization or umbrella for transhumanity, a tendancy for a weak
<br>
repository of info happens.
<br>
<p>ExI could easily cultivate a link-a-link directory of virtual and real time
<br>
locations for transhumanists, seminars, university courses, etc. Its
<br>
data/design would be open source and easily duplicated and disbursed on
<br>
other sites.
<br>
<p>However - &quot;all places are one place&quot; is far to collectivist for me and I
<br>
don't think that would work.  Rather, a better freeway design than what we
<br>
have now which are the basic net search engines.  I like Kurtzweil's site
<br>
design and I've asked Max if we can do something similar in regards to
<br>
transhumanist areas of interest.  I'll ask Amara about it as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In any case, articles are not the subject. I'm really talking about fusing
</em><br>
the disparate and separated transhumanist and pro-transhumanist online
<br>
communities into a closer configuration, allowing greater cross-pollination.
<br>
It is from community that things emerge, not from the posting of articles
<br>
(writing and posting articles is something that emerges from community, like
<br>
leaders, and new sites). So the content I'm talking about is e-mail, chat,
<br>
forum postings.&lt;
<br>
________
<br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The &quot;big technical solution&quot; I am referring to is pretty much the same
</em><br>
thing
<br>
as &quot;create some xml schemas so that the process can be automated.&quot; It's not
<br>
a hugely onerous or complex piece of work, given the initial goals.&lt;
<br>
________
<br>
<p>Yup.
