<p>Sure, but the conclusion still holds. See

<br>
<p>That IQ is heritable doesn't mean you can get the benefits of 
<br>
intelligence to reproduce across generations easily. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because we are suggesting that we provide what would could be called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ideal mental and social environment.  I defined that as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children will get to interact and compete with others of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence they will not face the boredom or negative social stigma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated with appearing to too smart that they would face in normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools.  The teachers likewise be chosen for their ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivate and teach gifted students.  Common sense tells me children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raised in such an environment would make much better use of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning and intellectual capacity than the same child in a normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school environment.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. It would likely help most of them most of the time. There is also 
<br>
a very real risk of them running into the usual problems gifted children 
<br>
have with overambitious parents trying to foist destiny on them, in 
<br>
this case not just &quot;make mommy happy&quot; but &quot;save humanity!&quot;. 
<br>
<p>But look at the big names in history (selected by the importance of
<br>
their contributions) and try to see how many of them had enriched
<br>
upbringings. You will see that most of them had entirely ordinary
<br>
upbringings of the time - Pasteur, Newton, Einstein, Edison and so on. 
<br>
There might be a larger incidence of enriched upbringings than in the 
<br>
population at large, but if you do the math you will see that increasing 
<br>
the number of good upbringings of people with good genes with 20 does 
<br>
not produce a large number of geniuses:
<br>
<p>Assume one genius per 100 million people (this could be regarded as a
<br>
definition of a genius): P(genius) = 10^-8. Assume normally one in a
<br>
thousand gets a really good upbringing: P(upbringing)=10^-3.  Assume a
<br>
good upbringing increases the likeliehood of being a genius a
<br>
hundredfold. 
<br>
<p>In a population of N people, you would get 
<br>
N*[(1-P(upbringing))*P(genius) + P(upbringing)*1000*P(genius)]
<br>
= N*[(1-1e-3)*1e-8 + 1e-3*1e-8*1000]=1.99e-8
<br>
geniuses on average.
<br>
<p>Now if you add 20 people to this equation, and let N=6e9, that increases 
<br>
P(upbringing) with just 3e-9! The increase in the number of geniuses 
<br>
would be minuscule. You can extend the above by adding a P(good genes), 
<br>
but it won't help much (in fact, it will make things worse). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only remaining probability would be whether these children would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to make a positive contribution to the singularity.  Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this should not be coercive they should be exposed to ideas and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of the singularity early in life.  Asked to write a few papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it as they are growing up.  And provided with news and discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how it perhaps may affect the singularity.  In this way we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope to have their efforts directed to the betterment of mankind if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the singularity itself.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe they will explain to the project leaders that the whole idea of 
<br>
the singularity is bunk? 
<br>
<p>The problem with real transformative genius is that it is creative and 
<br>
produces something entirely unexpected. While I approve of nurturing it, 
<br>
I don't think it can be nurtured with a specific goal in mind. If you by 
<br>
singularity mean &quot;general human progress&quot; then I might regard the aim of 
<br>
your project as valid (even if I disagree on the means), but it may 
<br>
very well be that these children advance it by becoming great writers, 
<br>
theologicians or revolutionaries. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once out of school these children should compete for research grants in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their chosen fields.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We will also learn much from a social experiment of this magnitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of 20 I would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 per year!
</em><br>
<p>You have never heard of Kantian ethics, have you? :-)
<br>
<p>While a lot of what Kant wrote was irrelevant or IMHO misled, I think
<br>
his point about never treating humans solely as means is important and
<br>
ties in with transhumanism. Why do we want to advance? Because we want
<br>
to enhance what it means to be a human, to get better lives. We are our
<br>
own ends. But if we are advancing by building savior kindergartens we
<br>
are turning people into means in just the way a lot of the anti-cloning 
<br>
ethicists are warning, and there would also be a contradiction with the 
<br>
aims of transhumanism. Sure, let people advance humanity if they want, 
<br>
and let's give children the best upbringing and genes we can make for 
<br>
them. But we shouldn't give them the upbringing and genes to fulfill 
<br>
*our* wants, but *theirs*. In general that will likely be the 
<br>
advancement of humanity too, in their own way. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want to accelerate the singularity, isn't it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; more cost-efficient to find ways of bringing extra 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; stimulation to the already existing kids that have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; good potential but too little stimulation? Maybe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Sesame Street 2.0 is more powerful than the cloning vat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is too much of a shotgun approach.  Of course we need better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools, better teachers, and better family environments but we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working towards that today.  Too many schools lack truly accelerated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs for the gifted to help them reach their full potential.
</em><br>
<p>Is progress done by lone geniuses or the collective intelligence of an 
<br>
entire civilization? I'm not saying that geniuses are unimportant or 
<br>
that individuals don't matter - far from it - but that real progress 
<br>
consists of far more than the initial imaginative spark: it is research, 
<br>
development, production, funding, application, feedback and regulation. 
<br>
Even if we get a lot more of those rare geniuses I would be surprised if 
<br>
that changed the rate of progress very much, since they would still have 
<br>
to rely on the *huge* infrastructure of collaborators, assistants, 
<br>
engineers, economists, customers and other &quot;unimportant&quot; people adding 
<br>
their own skills to the endeavor. And if you could make more of those 
<br>
smarter - even at random - you would get an amplifier effect. 
<br>
<p>The myth of the lone genius as the necessary and sufficient condition of 
<br>
progress is popular. But it isn't very true, and policies based on it 
<br>
can waste much effort and resources on infinitesimal gains. On the other 
<br>
hand, by fixing those messy and bad schools and education programs (even 
<br>
by subversively spreading education outside normal channels) you can get 
<br>
a lot of mediocre people to become a little bit less mediocre, or more 
<br>
accepting of new ideas.
