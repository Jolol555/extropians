<p><em>&gt; &gt; Claim: formal logic played no part in the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Western science.  (Einstein was mistaken.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, you were mistaken. Logic originated with the Greek philosophers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, as with any early development, there were errors made that took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to root out. Today we have entire taxonomies of logical errors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have taken time to identify and classify.
</em><br>
<p>You don't seem to be distinguishing between &quot;formal logic&quot; and
<br>
&quot;logic&quot;, which was the point of my entire post.  Had Einstein
<br>
omitted the word &quot;formal&quot;, I would be in utter agreement with
<br>
his quote.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Formal logic, on the other hand, arises when there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conscious awareness not only of the logic that is occurring,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but also of its formal aspect.  On this reading, most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (even the most intelligent) are unaware of formal logic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never resort to it.  Many highly intelligent people are even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; able to solve rather abstract puzzles such as the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     State the logical conclusion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;           (1) No ducks waltz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;           (2) No officers ever decline to waltz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;           (3) All my poultry are ducks
</em><br>
<p>This was supposed to be a puzzle whose logical
<br>
conclusion is not stated here.  It is not a 
<br>
syllogism as perhaps you thought I was claiming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; They solve it several methods, one of which is a rapid &quot;trial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and error&quot; of quickly generating and testing hypotheses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which Popper and others have elevated to the key principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behind evolutionary epistemology (and PCR).  Another is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to employ a kind of visualization similar to the manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of Venn-diagrams, to get a &quot;feel&quot; for what is the needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conclusion.  Yet others seize at random upon pairs of sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to extract---if possible---simple syllogisms of the sort &quot;if A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Syllogisms are useful, but only if one takes into consideration all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant variables.  You did not in the above example, which is why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its conclusion is nonsensical.  Therefore, your alleged disproof fails
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to demonstrate logic of its own.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Its conclusion&quot;?  What are you talking about?  
<br>
<p>&quot;My disproof&quot;?  What are you talking about?  I gave the above
<br>
puzzle as an illustration; it's not possible to take is as
<br>
proving anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; (The latter method shows that by taking (3), then applying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (1), and finally comparing that result with (2), the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rapidly obtains.)
</em><br>
<p>Did you try to solve the puzzle?  (It's from Lewis Carroll.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Aristotle practically invented formal logic, at least in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my opinion, and yet long before Aristotle mathematicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were solving geometry problems that required little more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than pure logic.  And far before them, chiefs, shamans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hunters, and family wranglers had also employed logic IMO,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just not formal logic.
</em><br>
<p>I'll elaborate.  We say that we are &quot;being logical&quot; when
<br>
our thinking is apparently free from simple errors, or
<br>
logical errors.  There are many kinds of logical errors,
<br>
as Harvey Newstrom liked to point out, and which you
<br>
referred to.  Here is a nice list:
<br>
<a href="http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/index.htm">http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/index.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I agree that Western science is highly dependent on logical
<br>
thought.  But as I said earlier, many people (and perhaps
<br>
animals) have been highly logical who never recognize the
<br>
formal aspects as first discovered by Aristotle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Finally, then, a tiny bit of Western mathematics, but no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Western science should be said to be based upon formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, since all real science is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics, your conclusion fails.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Real science is based upon mathematics&quot;?  Where exactly
<br>
does that leave the greatest scientist of them all?
<br>
<p>Also, besides him, one can mention Watson and Crick,
<br>
Pavlov, Faraday, and Aristotle himself, most of whose
<br>
scientific work didn't involve mathematics.
<br>
<p>But look at my claim more carefully.  Even so, I say
<br>
that only a *tiny* bit of Western mathematics is based
<br>
upon formal logic, virtually none of it before 1700,
<br>
except geometry.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  The greatest scientist of all, in the opinion
<br>
of many of us, was Charles Darwin.
