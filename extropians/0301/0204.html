<p>Cannabis: the good oil on Jesus
<br>
By Duncan Campbell,
<br>
Los Angeles
<br>
January 7 2003
<br>
<p><p>Jesus was almost certainly a proponent of the medicinal properties of
<br>
cannabis, according to a study of scriptural texts.
<br>
<p>The study suggests that Jesus and his disciples used the drug for miraculous
<br>
healings.
<br>
<p>The anointing oil used by Jesus and his disciples contained an ingredient
<br>
called kaneh-bosem, which has since been identified as cannabis extract,
<br>
according to an article by Chris Bennett published this month in the drugs
<br>
magazine High Times.
<br>
<p>The incense used by Jesus in ceremonies also contained a cannabis extract,
<br>
suggests Mr Bennett, who quotes scholars to back his claims.
<br>
<p>&quot;There can be little doubt about a role for cannabis in Judaic religion,&quot;
<br>
said Carl Ruck, professor of classical mythology at Boston University.
<br>
<p>On the existence of cannabis in ceremonial oils, he added: &quot;Obviously, the
<br>
easy availability and long-established tradition of cannabis in early
<br>
Judaism . . . would inevitably have included it in the mixtures.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr Bennett suggests that those anointed with the oils used by Jesus were
<br>
&quot;literally drenched&quot; in the potent mixture.
<br>
<p>&quot;Although most modern people choose to smoke or eat pot, when its active
<br>
ingredients are transferred into an oil-based carrier, it can also be
<br>
absorbed through the skin,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Quoting the New Testament, Mr Bennett argues that Jesus anointed his
<br>
disciples with the oil and encouraged them to do the same with other
<br>
followers.
<br>
<p>This could have been responsible for healing eye and skin diseases referred
<br>
to in the gospels.
