<p>
Ron h. missed my point:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Yes, I have asked you a cruel hard question.
</em><br>
<p>That is *not* what I wrote. I said that *my reply* to your speculative
<br>
question (&quot;Did the bomb on Bali scare your nation so badly?&quot;) would be
<br>
cruel, and so I would leave it unuttered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Then I listen to you and others as you advocate the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting the role of a sacrificial lamb.
</em><br>
<p>This is the second time you have proposed this bizarre analogy. I have never
<br>
previously heard of a sacrificial lamb armed to the teeth with the most
<br>
powerful weapons on the planet. This sacrificial lamb has been bombing parts
<br>
of Iraq weekly for the past 10 years, although the American press does not
<br>
make a big point of mentioning this (although plenty of accurate reporting
<br>
can be found if you look for it); on the contrary, the &quot;fourth-rate
<br>
dictator&quot;, despite his hateful rhetoric and cruel behavior toward those
<br>
under his control, has not harmed a hair of the sacrificial lamb, not has he
<br>
the power to do so (except to the extent that terrorists native to nations
<br>
supported by the USA have already done so).
<br>
<p>Why is US policy so intent on making war--with or without UN support--on
<br>
this nation with the second richest oil deposits on the planet? To defend
<br>
the Kurds? (The who?) To avenge the bombing of the WTC by a different group
<br>
of humans entirely? (Say what?) To prevent anyone in Iraq from getting the
<br>
idea of using the same tactics employed so tragically by a different group
<br>
of humans entirely? (Well, then, let's bomb *everyone* outside our direct
<br>
control, you never know.)
<br>
<p>The consequences of a major assault on Iraq might be no more terrible than
<br>
the deaths of many thousands of Iraqi, or it might be another step toward
<br>
the kind of hideous global Islamic uprising that will fuck us *all* up.
<br>
Meanwhile, US citizens are slowly being leached of their traditional
<br>
liberties. How can free people allow this to happen? The cruel riposte,
<br>
then, which I must now utter since you seem deaf to its unspoken
<br>
formulation, is this:
<br>
<p>Did the attack on the WTC scare your nation so badly?
<br>
