Sad, sad, sad to read a disgusting self-righteous letter like this one from
<br>
John Grigg. Sounds like the essay of an eight year old brainwashed boy.
<br>
<p>Shame on you, American cowboys! Shame on &quot;Pax Americana&quot;!
<br>
<p>For the very very first time in the 48 years of my life I feel a faint pride
<br>
to be citizen of a nation that does not agree with US aggression all over
<br>
the globe, though it's representatives may surrender at last.

<em>&gt; Damien, thank you for the much needed support.  I'm actually much more
</em><br>
concerned about Canada and Mexico launching a massive two-pronged sneak
<br>
attack against the United States while all our troops are away in the middle
<br>
east!  Fidel Castro of course will be the mastermind behind the entire
<br>
operation...  ; )
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, it is the indirect attack done through third parties in the
</em><br>
form of terrorism which worries us about Iraq.  We created this Frankenstein
<br>
monster and now we must go kill it.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's just very sad that several thousand U.S. troops may die in house to
</em><br>
house fighting in Baghdad, but that's what they signed up for.  I'm certain
<br>
an oil company CEO would say that to his confidantes as they watch on the
<br>
news the bodybags come home.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there MAY be very positive effects to the U.S. led toppling of
</em><br>
Saddam's regime.  When our forces have vanquished his large middle eastern
<br>
nation and are occupying it, the entire region will once and for all see our
<br>
now unrivaled power to crush our foes is to be dearly respected.  Of course
<br>
heavyhitters like Russia and China (even North Korea or &quot;ally&quot; Pakistan) are
<br>
still off the list since we would be biting off more then we could chew. lol
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next on our list of nations needing behavior modification should be Saudi
</em><br>
Arabia.  I would never want a &quot;friend&quot; who behaves like them!  I just wish
<br>
our oil addicted/ corrupt corporate and gov't leaders would have the resolve
<br>
to go fullbore into a program to relieve us of foreign oil dependancy.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with Mez that the real potential problem is China.  They have all
</em><br>
the raw materials to over the next several decades grow into a serious
<br>
regional if not global bully.  I just hope they prove better than that.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My father lives in New York City and I pray the consequences of our
</em><br>
occupation of Iraq is not seeing him and millions of others being vaporized
<br>
by a terrorist nuke.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pax Americana!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hoping for the best,
