</em><br>
<p>My little contribution to the history question:
<br>
<p>I think (based on a presentation of his I attended in Minneapolis back around
<br>
1985 or 1986) that Eric started thinking hard about nanotech as a result of
<br>
looking at what he called &quot;lightsails&quot; (extremely thin solar sails) and the
<br>
backing structures they'd need to have in order to stay stiff enough to be
<br>
generally useful--you might be able to make &quot;aluminized nothing&quot; for the sail
<br>
surface proper using bulk techniques such as vapor deposition on a surface you
<br>
then evaporate away, but how do you put an efficient truss structure behind that?
<br>
<p>And if you can build those sorts of few-atomic-diameter-dimension trusses at the
<br>
level nearest the sail surface, what *else* can you build? Uh oh, suddenly he's
<br>
not pointed toward a PhD in astro/aero....
<br>
<p>But that's my impression based on one presentation, and might have more to do
<br>
with the trajectory of his presentation than with his thinking's actual path.
