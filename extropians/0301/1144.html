Brett had posted a 34KB memoir on this topic, and I'm 
<br>
still responding.

<p><em>&gt; [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20List%20dynamics">owner-extropians@extropy.org</a>]On Behalf Of Brett Paatsch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sent: Monday, January 20, 2003 9:20 PM

<p><em>&gt; I like that movie [Gettysburg] (the one with Martin Sheen as General Lee)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because neither side is caricatured as villains, both sides show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially decent folk struggling heroically but tragically.
</em><br>
<p>Realism is refreshing.  Someday maybe we'll see understanding
<br>
(if not sympathetic) portrayals of Tojo, Hitler, and Stalin,
<br>
although of course they're nothing like the Southerners, and
<br>
naturally that will have to wait until everyone understands
<br>
their evil.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just a real darn shame the enemies we choose are so often each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other.  It's not like heroism is meaningless.  Or our human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propensity to fight cannot be redirected sometimes at least to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good effect. Hell let's fight death - the ancestral enemy. Let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectively kick it's butt around the block for a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millenia or longer at least.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I meant to say that their basic personality dispositions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hardly affected at all by how much they learn about a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well this is an interesting thesis. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But note: affected and effected are *both* valid in your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence but mean different things. I think you probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant effected.  
</em><br>
<p>No, I absolutely meant &quot;affected&quot;.  For example, someone who
<br>
is opinionated will rarely become less so by making a thorough
<br>
study of an issue.
<br>
<p>It wouldn't make sense to say that their personality dispositions
<br>
were effected, that is, created in some manner, by study of a
<br>
particular matter.  (But yes, if one considers *everything* 
<br>
they've ever learned, then their personalities are effected
<br>
at least somewhat by it, the other part being genetic.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But probably we are all both a bit more interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves and intimately acquainted with ourselves so perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't always give others the credit we give to ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>8^D
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact there is a social pysch phenomenon, at least one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called the &quot;fundamental attribution error&quot; that is based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this theme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Social psych's found by experiment, that we tend to see our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own behaviours as more likely to be determined by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation in which we find ourselves (ie. we see ourselves as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensitive, adapting and reactive in a good way), whereas we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to see others in the same situation where the observable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior is the same as having acted the way they did more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of personal disposition and less out of a response to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular situation in which the person finds themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Good.  Before, I had had explained to what the &quot;fundamental
<br>
attribution error&quot; was, but you've explicated it well, and
<br>
reminded me.  Maybe it's not exactly what I thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree its generally extremely difficult for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be retain a dispassionate perspective about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology. I think some may do it better than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others but probably all of us do it less well than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we think we do.
</em><br>
<p>Most probable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry for the long-windedness in this post Lee, (and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any readers). I wanted to respond to open questions openly.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, that's all right.  Unlike street demonstrations, one
<br>
can always ignore posts not to one's tastes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please feel free to prune this post ruthlessly for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevance or otherwise to the subject header.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, of course.  I think that that's the default assumption
<br>
around here.
<br>
<p>Lee
