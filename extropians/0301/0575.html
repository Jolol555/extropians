<p>No insult implied. Its just that I prepared a reply to one of

your posts only to log on and find that you've written another.

<p><em>&gt; Brett writes

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lee Corbin sets up a test as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Brett Paatsch claims that the two extended statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A.  &quot;I believe that life begins at conception.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     that any other points we might choose are essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     arbitrary and uncertain.  And I believe that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     a view founded not in religion, not in faith, but on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     the logic of the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; B.  &quot;My working hypothesis is that human existence begins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     at conception, and I contend that this is a view founded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;     not in religion, not in faith, but on logic.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are not equivalent.  I claim that they *are* equivalent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Who is correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Good idea to put the proposition to a test in this way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lee.  Your quite right, we should be able to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empirically whether extropians as a whole perceive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a difference between A and B. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, obviously there are differences.  The question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what are they, and how significant are they.
</em><br>
<p>Look up nine lines! No let me guess, there is a philosophical
<br>
difference between &quot;they *are* equivalent&quot; and &quot;there are
<br>
differences&quot; :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As Eliezer pointed out, B, as set up, is missing a sentence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (or A has an extra one), so that confounds the test a little.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, not at all.  That sentence is IMO completely redundant.
</em><br>
<p>But you explicitly made your *opinion* one of the variables !
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That the other dividing points between human and non-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are &quot;essentially arbitrary and uncertain&quot; follows from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy's claim that his view is based on logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also its possible that by putting names on the options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there might be subtle &quot;allegiance effects&quot; that have little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to do with the question being tested. I hope not, but its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not impossible, so I'd have preferred the propositions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not potentially confound a choice involving support or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposition of either one of our views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, you're right.  I'm in favor of openness almost instinctively,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but this is a case where the names may have hurt (or could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hurt).  Never underestimate the unconscious power of ideology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even on top of the way &quot;having a judicial temperament&quot; is beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people capabilities (or desires).   But I also confess to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some annoyance with you, and unkindly strove in pique to expose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your fallacy to the world at your expense :-)
</em><br>
<p>All is forgiven : )  I have annoyed people before : )
<br>
<p>But PLEASE focus on the issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Efforts to change other people's verbal habits are, IMO,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doomed. 
</em><br>
<p>Noted. Along with your changed word habits in recent posts ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One is already *very* lucky if he makes progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in changing someone's ontology, though usually even that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can only happen unconsciously in the target after months
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or years of unconscious processing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Example:  Jeff Davis asserts that the &quot;American Holocaust&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in full swing now, as is as bad as any other one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20th century.  Since he has planted this idea in our minds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the *best* possible outcome for him is for some of us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit years from now that the Americans have directly or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indirectly been responsible for as many megadeaths as those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous regimes, and this will occur when people have long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago forgotten where they heard any accusation as &quot;American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Holocaust&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>I'm not touching that in this post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Example:  I hope that people's verbal behavior will indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change from blithely throwing the word &quot;rights&quot; around, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead will either say that X approves (X may be a society)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or speak of &quot;legal rights&quot;.  But what I am after is completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different than what you are after, I think.  I want to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their belief about what exists, and then have their verbal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior change as a consequence of that.  You just want 'em
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drop the word and say &quot;I think&quot; instead of &quot;I believe&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or something.)
</em><br>
<p>I am really interested in your views about rights, I don't think
<br>
I get them yet, but not in this post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lots of other word memes and phrases could then be tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [like on a web site] including &quot;human life&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;human beings&quot; and we'd have a useful empirical tool easily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adapted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what focus groups do for politicians.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign managers and PR specialists do try out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various phrases on focus groups to see what goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over best.  I find it all abhorrent.  If one's position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has not really changed, i.e., actual judgments as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the states of affairs, then just using different words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems quite dishonest to me.
</em><br>
<p>I think I addressed the rationale for changing words in the other
<br>
post.
<br>
<p>Oh boy, am I going to get it if (I should say *when*) I make
<br>
a mistake in a post that you read. : ) And fair enough too : ) 
<br>
<p>Seriously, I'm not the enemy. Let's not debate for the sake of
<br>
debate. I'd enjoy it a bit, just as you do, but I don't want to
<br>
be a wiseguy and I *do* want to be an *alive* guy. 
<br>

Sincere Regards,
<br>
Brett
