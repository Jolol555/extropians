<p>It takes courage, in these cynical times, for a non-politician / non-whacko 
<br>
(pardon the tautology) to use the phrase &quot;moral imperative&quot; while talking 
<br>
about anything. I respect Po Bronson's eye for the mood of the times. A lot 
<br>
of this article also resonates.
<br>
<p>So, what do *you* want to Do With Your Life?

<p>What Should I Do With My Life?
<br>
<p>The real meaning of success -- and how to find it
<br>
<p>by Po Bronson
<br>
photographs by Michael Grecco
<br>
from FC issue 66, page 69
<br>
<p>It's time to define the new era. Our faith has been shaken. We've lost 
<br>
confidence in our leaders and in our institutions. Our beliefs have been 
<br>
tested. We've discredited the notion that the Internet would change 
<br>
everything ( and the stock market would buy us an exit strategy from the 
<br>
grind ). Our expectations have been dashed. We've abandoned the idea that 
<br>
work should be a 24-hour-a-day rush and that careers should be a wild 
<br>
adventure. Yet we're still holding on.
<br>
<p>We're seduced by the idea that picking up the pieces and simply tweaking 
<br>
the formula will get the party started again. In spite of our best thinking 
<br>
and most searing experience, our ideas about growth and success are mired 
<br>
in a boom-bust mentality. Just as LBOs gave way to IPOs, the market is 
<br>
primed for the next engine of wealth creation. Just as we traded in the 
<br>
pinstripes and monster bonuses of the Wall Street era for T-shirts and a 
<br>
piece of the action during the startup revolution, we're waiting to latch 
<br>
on to the new trappings of success. ( I understand the inclination. I've 
<br>
surfed from one boom to the next for most of my working life -- from my 
<br>
early days as a bond trader to my most recent career as a writer tracking 
<br>
the migration of my generation from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. )
<br>
<p>There's a way out. Instead of focusing on what's next, let's get back to 
<br>
what's first. The previous era of business was defined by the question, 
<br>
Where's the opportunity? I'm convinced that business success in the future 
<br>
starts with the question, What should I do with my life? Yes, that's right. 
<br>
The most obvious and universal question on our plates as human beings is 
<br>
the most urgent and pragmatic approach to sustainable success in our 
<br>
organizations. People don't succeed by migrating to a &quot;hot&quot; industry ( one 
<br>
word: dotcom ) or by adopting a particular career-guiding mantra ( remember 
<br>
&quot;horizontal careers&quot;? ). They thrive by focusing on the question of who 
<br>
they really are -- and connecting that to work that they truly love ( and, 
<br>
in so doing, unleashing a productive and creative power that they never 
<br>
imagined ). Companies don't grow because they represent a particular sector 
<br>
or adopt the latest management approach. They win because they engage the 
<br>
hearts and minds of individuals who are dedicated to answering that life 
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>This is not a new idea. But it may be the most powerfully pressing one ever 
<br>
to be disrespected by the corporate world. There are far too many smart, 
<br>
educated, talented people operating at quarter speed, unsure of their place 
<br>
in the world, contributing far too little to the productive engine of 
<br>
modern civilization. There are far too many people who look like they have 
<br>
their act together but have yet to make an impact. You know who you are. It 
<br>
comes down to a simple gut check: You either love what you do or you don't. 
<br>
Period.
<br>
<p>Those who are lit by that passion are the object of envy among their peers 
<br>
and the subject of intense curiosity. They are the source of good ideas. 
<br>
They make the extra effort. They demonstrate the commitment. They are the 
<br>
ones who, day by day, will rescue this drifting ship. And they will be 
<br>
rewarded. With money, sure, and responsibility, undoubtedly. But with 
<br>
something even better too: the kind of satisfaction that comes with knowing 
<br>
your place in the world. We are sitting on a huge potential boom in 
<br>
productivity -- if we could just get the square pegs out of the round holes.
<br>
<p>Of course, addressing the question, What should I do with my life? isn't 
<br>
just a productivity issue: It's a moral imperative. It's how we hold 
<br>
ourselves accountable to the opportunity we're given. Most of us are 
<br>
blessed with the ultimate privilege: We get to be true to our individual 
<br>
nature. Our economy is so vast that we don't have to grind it out forever 
<br>
at jobs we hate. For the most part, we get to choose. That choice isn't 
<br>
about a career search so much as an identity quest. Asking The Question 
<br>
aspires to end the conflict between who you are and what you do. There is 
<br>
nothing more brave than filtering out the chatter that tells you to be 
<br>
someone you're not. There is nothing more genuine than breaking away from 
<br>
the chorus to learn the sound of your own voice. Asking The Question is 
<br>
nothing short of an act of courage: It requires a level of commitment and 
<br>
clarity that is almost foreign to our working lives.
<br>
<p>During the past two years, I have listened to the life stories of more than 
<br>
900 people who have dared to be honest with themselves. Of those, I chose 
<br>
70 to spend considerable time with in order to learn how they did it. 
<br>
Complete strangers opened their lives and their homes to me. I slept on 
<br>
their couches. We went running together. They cried in my arms. We traded 
<br>
secrets. I met their families. I went to one's wedding. I witnessed many 
<br>
critical turning points.
<br>
<p>These are ordinary people. People of all ages, classes, and professions -- 
<br>
from a catfish farmer in Mississippi to a toxic-waste inspector in the oil 
<br>
fields of Texas, from a police officer in East Los Angeles to a long-haul 
<br>
trucker in Pennsylvania, from a financier in Hong Kong to a minister at a 
<br>
church on the Oregon coast. These people don't have any resources or 
<br>
character traits that give them an edge in pursuing their dream. Some have 
<br>
succeeded; many have not. Only two have what accountants call &quot;financial 
<br>
independence.&quot; Only two are so smart that they would succeed at anything 
<br>
they chose ( though having more choices makes answering The Question that 
<br>
much harder ). Only one, to me, is saintly. They're just people who faced 
<br>
up to it, armed with only their weaknesses, equipped with only their fears.
<br>
<p>What I learned from them was far more powerful than what I had expected or 
<br>
assumed. The first assumption to get busted was the notion that certain 
<br>
jobs are inherently cool and that others are uncool. That was a big shift 
<br>
for me. Throughout the 1990s, my basic philosophy was this: Work=Boring, 
<br>
but Work+Speed+Risk=Cool. Speed and risk transformed the experience into 
<br>
something so stimulating, so exciting, so intense, that we began to believe 
<br>
that those qualities defined &quot;good work.&quot; Now, betrayed by the reality of 
<br>
economic uncertainty and global instability, we're casting about for what 
<br>
really matters when it comes to work.
<br>
<p>On my journey, I met people in bureaucratic organizations and bland 
<br>
industries who were absolutely committed to their work. That commitment 
<br>
sustained them through slow stretches and setbacks. They never watched the 
<br>
clock, never dreaded Mondays, never worried about the years passing by. 
<br>
They didn't wonder where they belonged in life. They were phenomenally 
<br>
productive and confident in their value. In places unusual and unexpected, 
<br>
they had found their calling, and those callings were as idiosyncratic as 
<br>
each individual.
<br>
<p>And this is where the second big insight came in: Your calling isn't 
<br>
something you inherently &quot;know,&quot; some kind of destiny. Far from it. Almost 
<br>
all of the people I interviewed found their calling after great difficulty. 
<br>
They had made mistakes before getting it right. For instance, the catfish 
<br>
farmer used to be an investment banker, the truck driver had been an 
<br>
entertainment lawyer, a chef had been an academic, and the police officer 
<br>
was a Harvard MBA. Everyone discovered latent talents that weren't in their 
<br>
skill sets at age 25.
<br>
<p>Most of us don't get epiphanies. We only get a whisper -- a faint urge. 
<br>
That's it. That's the call. It's up to you to do the work of discovery, to 
<br>
connect it to an answer. Of course, there's never a single right answer. At 
<br>
some point, it feels right enough that you choose, and the energy formerly 
<br>
spent casting about is now devoted to making your choice fruitful.
<br>
<p>This lesson in late, hard-fought discovery is good news. What it means is 
<br>
that today's confused can be tomorrow's dedicated. The current difficult 
<br>
climate serves as a form of reckoning. The tougher the times, the more 
<br>
clarity you gain about the difference between what really matters and what 
<br>
you only pretend to care about. The funny thing is that most people have 
<br>
good instincts about where they belong but make poor choices and waste 
<br>
productive years on the wrong work. Why we do this cuts to the heart of the 
<br>
question, What should I do with my life? These wrong turns hinge on a small 
<br>
number of basic assumptions that have ruled our working lives, career 
<br>
choices, and ambitions for the better part of two decades. I found hardly 
<br>
any consistencies in how the people I interviewed discovered what they love 
<br>
to do -- the human soul resists taxonomy -- except when it came to four 
<br>
misconceptions ( about money, smarts, place, and attitude ) that have 
<br>
calcified into hobbling fears. These are stumbling blocks that we need to 
<br>
uproot before we can find our way to where we really belong.
<br>
<p>MONEY Doesn't Fund Dreams
<br>
Shouldn't I make money first -- to fund my dream? The notion that there's 
<br>
an order to your working life is an almost classic assumption: Pay your 
<br>
dues, and then tend to your dream. I expected to find numerous examples of 
<br>
the truth of this path. But I didn't find any.
<br>
<p>Sure, I found tons of rich guys who were now giving a lot away to charity 
<br>
or who had bought an island. I found plenty of people who had found 
<br>
something meaningful and original to do after making their money. But 
<br>
that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the garden-variety 
<br>
fantasy: Put your calling in a lockbox, go out and make a ton of money, and 
<br>
then come back to the lockbox to pick up your calling where you left it.
<br>
<p>It turns out that having the financial independence to walk away rarely 
<br>
triggers people to do just that. The reality is, making money is such hard 
<br>
work that it changes you. It takes twice as long as anyone plans for. It 
<br>
requires more sacrifices than anyone expects. You become so emotionally 
<br>
invested in that world -- and psychologically adapted to it -- that you 
<br>
don't really want to ditch it.
<br>
<p>I met many people who had left the money behind. But having &quot;enough&quot; didn't 
<br>
trigger the change. It had to get personal: Something had to happen such as 
<br>
divorce, the death of a parent, or the recognition that the long hours were 
<br>
hurting one's children. ( One man, Don Linn, left investment banking after 
<br>
he came home from a business trip and his two-year-old son didn't recognize 
<br>
him. )
<br>
<p>The ruling assumption is that money is the shortest route to freedom. 
<br>
Absurdly, that strategy is cast as the &quot;practical approach.&quot; But in truth, 
<br>
the opposite is true. The shortest route to the good life involves building 
<br>
the confidence that you can live happily within your means ( whatever the 
<br>
means provided by the choices that are truly acceptable to you turn out to 
<br>
be ). It's scary to imagine living on less. But embracing your dreams is 
<br>
surprisingly liberating. Instilled with a sense of purpose, your spending 
<br>
habits naturally reorganize, because you discover that you need less.
<br>
<p>This is an extremely threatening conclusion. It suggests that the vast 
<br>
majority of us aren't just putting our dreams on ice -- we're killing them. 
<br>
Joe Olchefske almost lost his forever. Joe started out in life with an 
<br>
interest in government. In the early 1980s, he made what seemed like a 
<br>
minor compromise: When he graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of 
<br>
Government, he went into public finance. He wouldn't work in government, 
<br>
he'd work with government.
<br>
<p>Joe went on to run Piper Jaffray in Seattle. By the mid-1990s, he realized 
<br>
that one little compromise had defined his life. &quot;I didn't want to be a 
<br>
high-priced midwife,&quot; he said. &quot;I wanted to be a mother. It was never my 
<br>
deal. It was my clients' deal. They were taking the risk. They were 
<br>
building hospitals and bridges and freeways, not me. I envied them for that.&quot;
<br>
<p>One night, riding up the elevator of his apartment building, Joe met newly 
<br>
hired Seattle schools superintendent John Stanford. Soon after, Stanford 
<br>
offered Olchefske a job as his CFO -- and partner in turning the troubled 
<br>
school system around. Olchefske accepted. Stanford rallied the city around 
<br>
school reform and earned the nickname Prophet of Hope. Meanwhile, Olchefske 
<br>
slashed millions from the budget and bloodlessly fired principals, never 
<br>
allowing his passions to interfere with his decisions. People called him 
<br>
Prophet of Doom.
<br>
<p>Then Stanford died suddenly of leukemia. It was one of the great crises in 
<br>
the city's history. Who could fill this void? Certainly not the 
<br>
green-eyeshade CFO. But Stanford's death transformed Olchefske. It broke 
<br>
him open, and he discovered in himself a new ability to connect with people 
<br>
emotionally, not just rationally. As the new superintendent, he draws on 
<br>
that gift more than on his private-sector skills. He puts up with a lot of 
<br>
bureaucrap, but he says that avoiding crap shouldn't be the objective in 
<br>
finding the right work. The right question is, How can I find something 
<br>
that moves my heart, so that the inevitable crap storm is bearable?
<br>
<p>SMARTS Can't Answer The Question
<br>
If the lockbox fantasy is a universal and eternal stumbling block when it 
<br>
comes to answering The Question, the idea that smarts and intensity are the 
<br>
essential building blocks of success and satisfaction is a product of the 
<br>
past decade. A set of twin misconceptions took root during the celebration 
<br>
of risk and speed that was the 90s startup revolution. The first is the 
<br>
idea that a smart, motivated individual with a great idea can accomplish 
<br>
anything. The corollary is that work should be fun, a thrill ride full of 
<br>
constant challenge and change.
<br>
<p>Those assumptions are getting people into trouble. So what if your destiny 
<br>
doesn't stalk you like a lion? Can you think your way to the answer? That's 
<br>
what Lori Gottlieb thought. She considered her years as a rising television 
<br>
executive in Hollywood to be a big mistake. She became successful but felt 
<br>
like a fraud. So she quit and gave herself three years to analyze which 
<br>
profession would engage her brain the most. She literally attacked the 
<br>
question. She dug out her diaries from childhood. She took classes in 
<br>
photography and figure drawing. She interviewed others who had left 
<br>
Hollywood. She broke down every job by skill set and laid that over a grid 
<br>
of her innate talents. She filled out every exercise in What Color Is Your 
<br>
Parachute?
<br>
<p>Eventually, she arrived at the following logic: Her big brain loved 
<br>
puzzles. Who solves puzzles? Doctors solve health puzzles. Therefore, 
<br>
become a doctor. She enrolled in premed classes at Pepperdine. Her 
<br>
med-school applications were so persuasive that every school wanted her. 
<br>
And then -- can you see where this is headed? -- Lori dropped out of 
<br>
Stanford Medical School after only two and a half months. Why? She realized 
<br>
that she didn't like hanging around sick people all day.
<br>
<p>The point is, being smarter doesn't make answering The Question easier. 
<br>
Using the brain to solve this problem usually only leads to answers that 
<br>
make the brain happy and jobs that provide what I call &quot;brain candy.&quot; 
<br>
Intense mental stimulation. But it's just that: candy. A synthetic 
<br>
substitute for other types of gratification that can be ultimately more 
<br>
rewarding and enduring. As the cop in East L.A. said of his years in 
<br>
management at Rockwell, &quot;It was like cheap wood that burns too fast.&quot;
<br>
<p>I struggled with this myself, but not until I had listened to hundreds of 
<br>
others did the pattern make itself shockingly clear. What am I good at? is 
<br>
the wrong starting point. People who attempt to deduce an answer usually 
<br>
end up mistaking intensity for passion. To the heart, they are vastly 
<br>
different. Intensity comes across as a pale busyness, while passion is 
<br>
meaningful and fulfilling. A simple test: Is your choice something that 
<br>
will stimulate you for a year or something that you can be passionate about 
<br>
for 10 years?
<br>
<p>This test is tougher than it seems on paper. In the past decade, the work 
<br>
world has become a battleground for the struggle between the boring and the 
<br>
stimulating. The emphasis on intensity has seeped into our value system. We 
<br>
still cling to the idea that work should not only be challenging and 
<br>
meaningful -- but also invigorating and entertaining. But really, work 
<br>
should be like life: sometimes fun, sometimes moving, often frustrating, 
<br>
and defined by meaningful events. Those who have found their place don't 
<br>
talk about how exciting and challenging and stimulating their work is. 
<br>
Their language invokes a different troika: meaningful, significant, 
<br>
fulfilling. And they rarely ever talk about work without weaving in their 
<br>
personal history.
<br>
<p>PLACE Defines You
<br>
Every industry has a culture. And every culture is driven by a value 
<br>
system. In Hollywood, where praise is given too easily and thus has been 
<br>
devalued, the only honest metric is box-office receipts. So box-office 
<br>
receipts are all-important. In Washington, DC, some very powerful 
<br>
politicians are paid middling salaries, so power and money are not equal. 
<br>
Power is measured by the size of your staff and by how many people you can 
<br>
influence. In police work, you learn to be suspicious of ordinary people 
<br>
driving cars and walking down the street.
<br>
<p>One of the most common mistakes is not recognizing how these value systems 
<br>
will shape you. People think that they can insulate themselves, that 
<br>
they're different. They're not. The relevant question in looking at a job 
<br>
is not What will I do? but Who will I become? What belief system will you 
<br>
adopt, and what will take on heightened importance in your life? Because 
<br>
once you're rooted in a particular system -- whether it's medicine, New 
<br>
York City, Microsoft, or a startup -- it's often agonizingly difficult to 
<br>
unravel yourself from its values, practices, and rewards. Your money is 
<br>
good anywhere, but respect and status are only a local currency. They get 
<br>
heavily discounted when taken elsewhere. If you're successful at the wrong 
<br>
thing, the mix of praise and opportunity can lock you in forever.
<br>
<p>Don Linn, the investment banker who took over the catfish farm in 
<br>
Mississippi, learned this lesson the hard way. After years as a star at 
<br>
PaineWebber and First Boston, he dropped out when he could no longer bring 
<br>
himself to push deals on his clients that he knew wouldn't work. His life 
<br>
change smacked of foolish originality: 5.5 million catfish on 1,500 water 
<br>
acres. His first day, he had to clip the wings of a flock of geese. Covered 
<br>
in goose shit and blood, he wondered what he had gotten himself into. But 
<br>
he figured it out and grew his business into a $16 million operation with 
<br>
five side businesses. More important, the work reset his moral compass. In 
<br>
farming, success doesn't come at another farmer's expense. You learn to 
<br>
cooperate, sharing processing plants, feed mills, and pesticide-flying 
<br>
services.
<br>
<p>Like Don, you'll be a lot happier if you aren't fighting the value system 
<br>
around you. Find one that enforces a set of beliefs that you can really get 
<br>
behind. There's a powerful transformative effect when you surround yourself 
<br>
with like-minded people. Peer pressure is a great thing when it helps you 
<br>
accomplish your goals instead of distracting you from them.
<br>
<p>Carl Kurlander wrote the movie St. Elmo's Fire when he was 24. For years 
<br>
afterward, he lived in Beverly Hills. He wanted to move back to Pittsburgh, 
<br>
where he grew up, to write books, but he was always stopped by the doubt, 
<br>
Would it really make any difference to write from Pittsburgh instead of 
<br>
from Beverly Hills? His books went unwritten. Last year, when a looming 
<br>
Hollywood writers' strike coincided with a job opening in the 
<br>
creative-writing department at Pitt, he finally summoned the courage to 
<br>
move. He says that being in academia is like &quot;bathing in altruism.&quot; Under 
<br>
its influence, he wrote his first book, a biography of the comic Louie 
<br>
Anderson.
<br>
<p>ATTITUDE Is the Biggest Obstacle
<br>
Environment matters, but in the end, when it comes to tackling the 
<br>
question, What should I do with my life? it really is all in your head. The 
<br>
first psychological stumbling block that keeps people from finding 
<br>
themselves is that they feel guilty for simply taking the quest seriously. 
<br>
They think that it's a self-indulgent privilege of the educated upper 
<br>
class. Working-class people manage to be happy without trying to &quot;find 
<br>
themselves,&quot; or so the myth goes.
<br>
<p>But I found that just about anybody can find this question important. It's 
<br>
not just for free agents, knowledge workers, and serial entrepreneurs. I 
<br>
met many working-class people who found this question essential. They might 
<br>
have fewer choices, but they still care. Take Bart Handford. He went from 
<br>
working the graveyard shift at a Kimberley-Clark baby-wipes plant in 
<br>
Arkansas to running the Department of Agriculture's rural-development 
<br>
program. He didn't do this by just pulling up his bootstraps. His 
<br>
breakthrough came when his car was hit by a train, and he spent six months 
<br>
in bed exploring The Question.
<br>
<p>Probably the most debilitating obstacle to taking on The Question is the 
<br>
fear that making a choice is a one-way ride, that starting down a path 
<br>
means closing a door forever.
<br>
<p>&quot;Keeping your doors open&quot; is a trap. It's an excuse to stay uninvolved. I 
<br>
call the people who have the hardest time closing doors Phi Beta Slackers. 
<br>
They hop between esteemed grad schools, fat corporate gigs, and prestigious 
<br>
fellowships, looking as if they have their act together but still feeling 
<br>
like observers, feeling as if they haven't come close to living up to their 
<br>
potential.
<br>
<p>Leela de Souza almost got lost in that trap. At age 15, Leela knew exactly 
<br>
what she wanted to be when she grew up: a dancer. She pursued that dream, 
<br>
supplementing her meager dancer's pay with work as a runway model. But she 
<br>
soon began to feel that she had left her intellect behind. So, in her early 
<br>
twenties, with several good years left on her legs, she took the SATs and 
<br>
applied to college. She paid for a $100,000 education at the University of 
<br>
Chicago with the money that she had earned from modeling and during the 
<br>
next seven years made a series of seemingly smart decisions: a year in 
<br>
Spain, Harvard Business School, McKinsey &amp; Co., a White House Fellowship, 
<br>
high-tech PR. But she never got any closer to making a real choice.
<br>
<p>Like most Phi Beta Slackers, she was cursed with tremendous ability and 
<br>
infinite choices. Figuring out what to do with her life was constantly on 
<br>
her mind. But then she figured something else out: Her need to look 
<br>
brilliant was what was keeping her from truly answering The Question. When 
<br>
she let go of that, she was able to shift gears from asking &quot;What do I do 
<br>
next?&quot; to making strides toward answering &quot;To what can I devote my life?&quot;
<br>
<p>Asking What Should I Do With My Life? is the modern, secular version of the 
<br>
great timeless questions about our identity. Asking The Question aspires to 
<br>
end the conflict between who you are and what you do. Answering The 
<br>
Question is the way to protect yourself from being lathed into someone 
<br>
you're not. What is freedom for if not the chance to define for yourself 
<br>
who you are?
<br>
<p>I have spent the better part of the past two years in the company of people 
<br>
who have dared to confront where they belong. They didn't always find an 
<br>
ultimate answer, but taking the question seriously helped get them closer. 
<br>
We are all writing the story of our own life. It's not a story of conquest. 
<br>
It's a story of discovery. Through trial and error, we learn what gifts we 
<br>
have to offer the world and are pushed to greater recognition about what we 
<br>
really need. The Big Bold Leap turns out to be only the first step.
<br>
<p><p>Sidebar: One Size Does Not Fit All
<br>
Two different answers to one ultimate question
<br>
<p>Organization Man Of the 900 people who I talked to, only one has had the 
<br>
same employer for his entire adult life. His name is Russell Carpenter, 
<br>
he's 35, and he's an aerospace engineer at NASA Goddard. We can all learn 
<br>
from him. Russell began working at NASA during college. In exchange for his 
<br>
summers, they paid for his tuition and, later, financed his PhD. Russell is 
<br>
a GS-14, stuck to government pay scales. The money is okay, but it's never 
<br>
the reason to stay. He's building a guidance system for the newest type of 
<br>
satellite.
<br>
<p>The halls and offices at NASA are quiet. These engineers are content with 
<br>
slowly pushing toward a solution. Which I took as Extractable Lesson number 
<br>
one: time frame. At NASA, Russell has found an intermediate time frame 
<br>
where he can accomplish the high-minded objectives that his division is 
<br>
charged with, but he's not under absurd pressure to do it all in 90 days.
<br>
<p>Aerospace engineers are obsessed with redundancy and backup systems. 
<br>
Russell knows that metals give, that gears slip, and that motors overheat, 
<br>
and he plans for that in his designs. Not everything has to go right in 
<br>
order for it to work. And that way of thinking shows up in every aspect of 
<br>
his life, including how he achieves his ambitions. Which I took as 
<br>
Extractable Lesson number two: His backup plans do not lead to different 
<br>
destinations, such as &quot;If I don't get into business school, I'll be a 
<br>
schoolteacher.&quot; His backup plans lead to the same destination, and if he 
<br>
has to arrive late by a back road, that's fine.
<br>
<p>Later, Russell and I went to a baseball game, which clued me in to 
<br>
Extractable Lesson number three: Russell doesn't let himself get burned 
<br>
out. He doesn't think it's a big deal that he's only had one employer. His 
<br>
method is his secret, but it's no secret.
<br>
<p>&quot;So what do you do?&quot; For five years, Marcela Widrig had a dream job that 
<br>
compensated her well, let her live in Barcelona, and paid for her frequent 
<br>
travel throughout Southern Europe. She sold modems for a big modem 
<br>
manufacturer. Modems were her means to her ends: money, travel, human 
<br>
connection.
<br>
<p>When her company moved her to San Francisco, she suffered culture shock. 
<br>
The Internet was destroying everything that she loved about sales. The new 
<br>
ethos was speed. Get the deal done in a day! Don't even fly -- email makes 
<br>
it so easy! The human contact was gone.
<br>
<p>The worst part was constantly being asked The Inevitable Cocktail-Party 
<br>
Question: &quot;What do you do?&quot; Marcela had been away long enough to have 
<br>
forgotten about this disgusting American custom. She found it degrading and 
<br>
reductive and mercenary. I too used to think that The Inevitable 
<br>
Cocktail-Party Question was a scourge on our society. But I'm starting to 
<br>
see that it is really about freedom to choose. A status system has evolved 
<br>
that values being unique and true even more than it values being 
<br>
financially successful.
<br>
<p>In other words, if you don't like The Inevitable Cocktail-Party Question, 
<br>
maybe it's partly because you don't like your answer.
<br>
<p>Marcela no longer liked her answer. She endured migraines and insomnia. 
<br>
After flying all the way to Hong Kong for a meeting that didn't even last 
<br>
one hour, she vowed, &quot;I cannot sell one more modem.&quot; But she didn't quit 
<br>
for two more years. On her vacations, she flew to Switzerland to train in a 
<br>
school for deep-tissue massage. It was her way to move toward genuine human 
<br>
contact. The day she returned from one of her Switzerland trips, the modem 
<br>
company went under, and she was forced into her new life.
<br>
<p>It took her about a year to drop the business-suit persona and truly 
<br>
embrace her new profession. The Inevitable Cocktail-Party Question no 
<br>
longer bothers her. &quot;I do body work,&quot; she says. &quot;I love what I do, and I 
<br>
think that comes across.&quot;
