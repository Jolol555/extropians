Kai suggested:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;No, but your president and his fellows should think a little bit further. 
<br>
It's not enough to throw some bombs, when this just feeds the troops of 
<br>
another enemy.
<br>
War against terrorism is not comparable with conventional wars. It means 
<br>
fighting against belief systems and against the causes for the motivation 
<br>
of those people. Wars like this can not be won with bombs. You either win 
<br>
them in the minds or not at all. Therefore, the only intelligent idea of 
<br>
Mr. Bush so far has been the &quot;coalition against terrorism&quot;. He now is 
<br>
going to destroy this coalition for no sensible reason.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It is comparable, in some ways, to every conventional war. Look at 
<br>
Afghanistan. Consider that the war against saddam is also a war against the 
<br>
Wahabbis in Saudi. If Iraqi oil competes in the marketplace with Saudi oil 
<br>
(even in OPEC) then funding is cut to madrassahs and militant orgs. Less cash 
<br>
from oil will put a pinch on the ruling regime as well as the Mullahs that 
<br>
they themselves willingly fund. This war is closer to a cold war, then a hot 
<br>
one, but somehow, pressure needs to be placed on the worlds Islamic regimes 
<br>
to act better-whether they like it or not! Right now W Bush is the only game 
<br>
in town.
<br>

<br>
<p>Theres no coalition, if all one wishes to do is avoid pissing-off the Islamic 
<br>
militants and their political and financial supporters. One has to break eggs 
<br>
to make an omlette.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;There are a lot more countries known to have 
<br>
or manufacture ABC weapons, which are a lot more unstable, unpredictable 
<br>
and would sell anything to anyone. Former GUS states, Pakistan, North 
<br>
Korea, Jemen, Sudan, etc. So why isn't there an international coalition 
<br>
against proliferation, lead by the US, but instead only one focus on one 
<br>
of the most unlikely terrorist supporting countries in the world?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>No. Iraq is a supreme player in the game of state terrorism. Wasn't Abu Nidal 
<br>
assasinated by Iraq agents in Bagdad, just 3 months ago? Iraq being depicted 
<br>
as a monor player is like-wise depicting Iran as a &quot;good world citizen&quot;, 
<br>
whatever that means. Iraq, has surely played a clearing house for a variety 
<br>
of terror groups, including providing Air Iraq jetliners to practice on, for 
<br>
several of the 19, 9-11 thugs, back in 1998.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The US are not going to war for moral, ethics and democracy - or not any 
<br>
longer. Would that be so, other countries than Iraq would be top on the 
<br>
list. Countries where people die of hunger, while a small elite sells 
<br>
their country for their own profit.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ok so were the baddies. :-)  On the other hand, I don't wish to hear any 
<br>
gnashing of teeth from Europe when it comes their turn to be the target of 
<br>
spectacular attacks. 
<br>
<p>Count me as one of those who are very comfortable with the colapse of Islamic 
<br>
regimes, and inhibiting of Jihadist culture.
