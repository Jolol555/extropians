<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Natural Rights are those legal liberties which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the evolutionary history of human culture has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstrated provide superior selection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; survival, of both the individual and the society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in which the individual resides. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Human culture has *not* demonstrated that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legal liberties provide superior selection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; survival, and so on (except quite recently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and for just a few people).  These legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; liberties are a property of our civilization,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not our DNA.  It's still a massive epistemological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; error, IMO, to keep imputing these &quot;properties&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentient beings as being in any way independent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the historical situation in which the human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; find themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These legal liberties are rules in which Darwinian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Lamarckian evolutionary agents (of which both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; types operate deterministically according to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embedded laws of physics) interact. It's not just our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA, its our memes as well, our accumulated knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I certainly agree with that.  Of course, you
<br>
are quite aware that the Darwinian processes lead
<br>
to human DNA and human nature on the one hand, and
<br>
by a quite separate process---though still Darwinian
<br>
of course---led to the world's various societies and
<br>
civilizations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The purported 'historical situation' human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find themselves in is also dependent upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics of physics,
</em><br>
<p>Rather indirectly, I must say!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but it is also merely a selection effect, much like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a selection effect that life found it easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to evolve on the surface of a terrestrial planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Earth rather than others like Venus or Mars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Jovian worlds like Jupiter and Saturn. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are making a massive epistemological error of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imputing the cause to these boundary condition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection effects rather than the more operative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying rules which govern behavior no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what point in history a human being finds themselves.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, you've waxed too abstract for me.  What are
<br>
you saying in plain language?  Now, &quot;human nature&quot; is
<br>
most usually (and correctly) taken to refer to our
<br>
biological heritage (often spoken of as our DNA).  It
<br>
was about what was and was not universal in human nature
<br>
that the big 20th century fights took place.  In the end,
<br>
Margaret Mead and her mentor Franz Boas lost, and Edward
<br>
Wilson and his allies won.  There is a definite universal
<br>
human nature.
<br>
<p>However, Mead and Boas were overreacting against an 
<br>
equally wrong earlier conception:  that upper class
<br>
people and white people were intrinsically superior
<br>
just because their cultures obviously were.
<br>
<p>Well, then, for the purposes of the present discussion,
<br>
just how extensive is that &quot;human nature&quot;?  Does it
<br>
encompass what the proponents of Natural Law and
<br>
Natural Rights are always talking about?  I say it
<br>
does not, and that is the reason that you cannot
<br>
find up-to-date treatments of the human condition
<br>
that address these.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When, lastly, I wrote on this subject, I mentioned six
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; books I've read or re-studied recently that deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what I think are the relevant themes.  They were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     Knowledge and Decisions, by Thomas Sowell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     The Origins of Virtue, by Matt Ridley
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     The Fatal Conceit, by F.A. Hayek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     Power and Prosperity, by Mancur Olsen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     The Mystery of Capital, by Hernando De Soto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     Carnage and Culture, by Victor Davis Hanson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I now find that I could name another half dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seemingly relevant works that also fail to contain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;natural rights&quot; or &quot;natural law&quot; in the index.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't matter. The air exists for us to breath,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so its existence is taken as assumed.
</em><br>
<p>By whom?  That's what I'm questioning!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't need to recite such basic concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rules in order to build upon their validity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (though apparently for some readers, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one must).
</em><br>
<p>Indeed one must, and I do appreciate sincere
<br>
efforts to enlighten me.  But the evidence is
<br>
becoming stronger and stronger that these are
<br>
outmoded concepts.  Moreover, it is preposterous
<br>
that &quot;everybody knows&quot; this but me.  And recall
<br>
my exchange with Lee Daniel Crocker:
<br>
<p><em>   &gt; [Lee Corbin wrote]
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;&gt; The notation &quot;Natural rights&quot; is very *inconvenient* for many
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;&gt; reasons.  First, people do not mean the same thing by it at all.
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;&gt; Many religious people mean something *quite* different from what
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;&gt; ordinary materialists could possibly mean.  Second, it gets very
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;&gt; confused with &quot;natural law&quot; as this thread amply demonstrates.
</em><br>
<p><em>   &gt; I won't disagree with that.  But the fact that a term is used
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; in ambiguous ways doesn't mean it can't also be used more
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; rigorously by people who agree on a foundation.  I think the
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; libertarian/anarchocapitalist/individualist interpretation of
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; &quot;natural rights&quot; is reasonably consistent and useful, even if
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; some of those who use it probably go too far.
</em><br>
<p><em>   &gt; I will also concede that &quot;natural rights&quot; is a term inherently
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; two steps removed from reality in the sense that it implies
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; both that there are natural laws of human behavior, and further
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; that many of them are expressible in terms of &quot;rights&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>   &gt; are restraints of secondary action.
</em><br>
<p>So I say, &quot;chuck it&quot;.  It's a relic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll note that you seem to be cherry picking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your books. For example, a more important work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Hayek is &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot;, in which he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does endorse concepts of natural rights.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you!  Someone finally mentioned a good 
<br>
book that contains such a discussion.  Praise be.
<br>
<p>I must seriously resent your implication, however,
<br>
that I have been at all dishonest or selective.
<br>
I have &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; around somewhere,
<br>
but did not run across it.  By God, I would have
<br>
mentioned it if I had.
<br>
<p>Can you mention any other books that discuss
<br>
either &quot;Natural Law&quot; or &quot;Natural Rights&quot;?
<br>
