<p>Did Stephen Hawking and Christopher Reeve wound up in that state

deliberately? Did they at some point have to make a deliberate decision 
<br>
bringing them onto a different fork on road? They didn't. In both cases it 
<br>
was an accident. I very much doubt Christopher Reeve would be riding at 
<br>
all, if he knew the risks associated with that.

<em>&gt; Even If a clone was born profoundly disabled, I couldn't say it was

<p>Did I get that right? Are you proposing that we produce defective children

by an undebugged process on purpose?

<em>&gt;        I can only see cloning as a good thing. It is inevitable that there

<p>No, it is not inevitable. All you need is to figure out how to reset the 
<br>
genome, and everything is dandy (provided no other difficulties appear).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; isn't exactly the safest thing in the world. These cases of abnormality due

<p>How about some actual numbers, comparing the defect rate in normal birth 
<br>
rate and cloning instead of engaging in boolean argumentation? The world

is not black and white, so let's not treat it that way when argumenting.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; honestly cant see any clone coming to term with such an ailment that would 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I disagree vehemently. If you did that to me on purpose for no good 
<br>
reason at all (cloning doesn't result in any enhancement) I'd sue you, or 
<br>
worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Most of the arguments I have heard against cloning are about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational fears of what we will do with these clones. Great unstoppable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armies, better make them immune from every pathogen on the planet! Slave 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labour, please! Hideously deformed mutants,!
</em><br>
<p>Strawman.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Why don't we just replace the word Clone with Twin in every doom sayer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper on the subject and reread them? I know a few Twins and funnily enough 
</em><br>
<p>Why don't we replace the world clone with 'identical twin with defects 
<br>
produced artificially', and reread them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they have never tried to take over the world, have never been used for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific experimentation, have the same civil rights as the rest of us and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as hideously deformed mutants. well they may not be the pretiest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, but I think that is a bit harsh.
</em><br>
<p>Are you doing this on purpose, or can't you really tell the difference
<br>
between a defective clone produced by a current procedure and an identical
<br>
twin?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Didn't we have most of these arguements and fears when IVF first produced a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baby? Can anyone remember?
