<em>&gt; Intersting, Emlyn. Are you arguing for a more Greek style 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;direct democracy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enabled by intelligence augmentation and multiple and fast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed I am, to the extent that government is necessary. OTOH, the
<br>
anarcho-capitalist crowd will tell you that the market can do whatever the
<br>
govt can do, but better, and I expect they'd say that IA and real
<br>
communication would only strengthen this. I'm not an anarcho-captialist, but
<br>
only given the current human condition; in the future context presented I
<br>
think the optimal style of organisation is very much an open question;
<br>
anarcho capitalism might work, looking very much like that trading-style
<br>
distributed computing architecture (called something starting with A? I
<br>
can't remember enough to google it :-(  ).
<br>
<p>I certainly think that the kind of modularity &amp; specialisation that we rely
<br>
on will be unnecessary to beings who can comprehend orders-of-magnitude more
<br>
complex systems in one mental grab. But then, the society should become
<br>
correspondingly more complex and difficult to model, so maybe I'm wrong. I
<br>
do think that it is very difficult to justify a model with a small executive
<br>
at the top.
