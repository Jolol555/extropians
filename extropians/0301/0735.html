<p>### We could extend currently accepted practices as follows - since we do
<br>
not prohibit the reproduction of persons who produce only, or predominantly
<br>
very sick offspring, we have to accept any attempt at reproduction, no
<br>
matter how unlikely to produce healthy children. However, we could decide
<br>
that there must be a certain minimal level of &quot;expected health&quot; (percentage
<br>
of healthy surviving offspring). In that case, the principle of equality
<br>
before the law would require that all parents should be treated equally, and
<br>
both parents who endanger the health of their children by giving them e.g.
<br>
the gene for Huntington's disease, and the parents who use a dangerous
<br>
assistive technique, would be subject to the same sanctions. The expected
<br>
health level could be set at e.g. -2SD (i.e., a birth that would be two
<br>
standard deviations below the mean expected health, as determined by medical
<br>
and genetic forecasting methods, would be prohibited).
<br>
<p>Another tack would be to require insurance for costs of extended care of
<br>
disabled children, and costs of wrongful life suits brought by the children,
<br>
including capped punitive damages. This would discourage frivolous
<br>
reproduction, and provide for the needs of the disabled, without burdening
<br>
the public purse.
