<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been heavily influenced by two forces.  First, I am a Christian 
<br>
and Second I have read Robert L. Humphreys.  As it is unlikely many of you 
<br>
are Christians let me use Robert L. Humphreys as my basis.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Humphrey came to young manhood during the 30s.  He rode the rails 
<br>
and lived in the hobo jungles for a while.  He also fought as a professional 
<br>
welterweight boxer.  When the 2nd World War began he was qualified for 
<br>
officer training by one means or another and became a 2nd Lt. in the USMC.  
<br>
In the course of time he was an infantry platoon leader on Iwo Jima.  After 
<br>
the war he graduated Harvard Law School and became an attorney.  As time went 
<br>
on he developed an expertise in settling conflict between large groups of 
<br>
civilians and others.  If he was or was not a member of any church I am not 
<br>
aware of that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a law student he got interested in the field of &quot;Natural Rights&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;Natural Law.&quot;  I believe one proceeds from the other.  As a peace maker he 
<br>
felt there was one natural law that was absolutely universal and vital -- 
<br>
break it and you have the beginning of conflict.  He said we must always 
<br>
remember that the poorest most down trodden person in the world loves their 
<br>
spouse (&amp; children) as much as we do and is as interested in seeing those 
<br>
dear ones happy &amp; successful -- natural law number one.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't try to go into everything he said about natural law as it took 
<br>
him two books to cover the subject and can't hope to do it in less space.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I have to ask this.  If we do not recognise natural law and 
<br>
natural rights then why do we have a republic or try to place restraints on a 
<br>
government as to what it can or can or cannot do to its citizenry.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we restrain governments because we intuitively feel there are 
<br>
natural laws and natural rights -- that it is wrong for a government to 
<br>
violate those laws.  If we do not believe this then why is it wrong for a 
<br>
constitutional democracy to change its constitution to remove all restraints 
<br>
and then treat its minorities as it wishes?
<br>
