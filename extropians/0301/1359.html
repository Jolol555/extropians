<p><p>And then responded to me by saying:
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't have time for this. More senseless than war X does not 
<br>
make a firm claim how senseless war X was. I believe it was 
<br>
pretty damn senseless but I don't have time, energy or 
<br>
inclination to debate that when we are about to do something 
<br>
REALLY stupid. Can I make it any more clear without people 
<br>
wasting their fine minds picking at every sentence?&quot;
<br>
<p>I am not picking at your every sentence, at least not in a nit-picking sense. 
<br>
I have consistently questioned your general assertion that apparently every 
<br>
US foreign intervention was inappropriate besides World War II. I have taken 
<br>
particular issue with your dismissal of the Vietnam (more accurately the 
<br>
Indochina) War as &quot;senseless.&quot; I then proceeded to argue that it was not, in 
<br>
fact, senseless, but one of our most noble enterprises of the 20th Century, 
<br>
successful or not. I have then respectfully, in my opinion, challenged you to 
<br>
justify your position on the conflict, which I feel is untenable. The reason 
<br>
I have done this is simple. If you are unable to justify your position with 
<br>
regard to Vietnam, something I assume you have had a few decades to do, why 
<br>
should anyone regard your current dismissal of action in Iraq as anything 
<br>
more than an emotional appeal with no basis in logic or fact?
<br>
<p>&quot;If you want something productive to do then show precisely how 
<br>
this war is a really, really good thing and that nothing very 
<br>
bad will come from it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, given that rationale, we would have simply abandoned Afghanistan to 
<br>
Bin Laden and Mullah Omar following 9/11 because the track record of foreign 
<br>
armies in that country wasn't that great. But that thinking would ignore the 
<br>
fact that the Taliban was without any sort of aid from a superpower, 
<br>
something not true in the past.  I have seen analysis on both a left-leaning 
<br>
network (CNN) and a right leaning one (Fox News), in addition to foreign 
<br>
policy journals which all suggest that Saddam's army is in weaker shape now 
<br>
than in 1991. There was no obscene loss of life in the Persian Gulf War 
<br>
against his forces. There is no logical reason to believe there would be one 
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>&quot;Personally I haven't heard that really 
<br>
done by anyone. Without that the charge of it being &quot;senseless&quot; 
<br>
and a Bad Idea (tm) stands. The burden of proof is on those who 
<br>
advocate this mess.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me start by saying that I always appreciate a good ™ joke. I see no 
<br>
evidence that removing Saddam will result in a bloodbath. You have suggested 
<br>
in another post, which I will address later, that we should be attempting 
<br>
more diplomatic measures. I would argue that this avenue is not guaranteed to 
<br>
succeed, and, as evidenced by Kim Jong Il (Everybody's Favorite Communist 
<br>
Child Molester ™), it can also serve to embolden the totalitarian thugs.
