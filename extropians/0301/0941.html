</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                 -Albert Einstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This quote precedes the dedication and table of contents of Judea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pearl's book &quot;Causality&quot;, an overdue tome restoring the irreplaceable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of causality to its rightful intellectual status, and,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidently, suggesting a useful formal tool for statisticians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The author obviously selected this quote because of its second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrase about causal relationships.  But what about the first phrase?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think it's true!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Claim: formal logic played no part in the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western science.  (Einstein was mistaken.)
</em><br>
<p>No, you were mistaken. Logic originated with the Greek philosophers,
<br>
though, as with any early development, there were errors made that took
<br>
time to root out. Today we have entire taxonomies of logical errors
<br>
that have taken time to identify and classify.

<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S.  I have included in this post a defense of my claim, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in case I too clearly delineate the issue along biased lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thus hold back good arguments, perhaps some perhaps may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish to analyze this thesis in its absence.  So don't &quot;page down&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This isn't just egotistical on my part, for I did last summer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list suffer accusations that the way I lay out arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is often, along these lines, manipulative and disingenuous.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Defense of the above claim:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (page down)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say that formal logic is to be distinguished from informal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic as follows.  Suppose that a dog returns from a romp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and finds that his master's shoes still aren't on the front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; porch.  It's quite possible that the dog in effect uses logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to conclude that his master isn't home yet, by (again, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect) thinking &quot;if he were home, then his shoes would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here; as they are not, he has yet to return&quot;.  This is known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as utilizing the *contrapositive*, a logical equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;p implies q&quot; which takes the form &quot;if not q, then not p&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The dog may simply determine only that the master is not present,
<br>
making no determinations about whether he had returned (and then left)
<br>
or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since awareness in dogs is problematical, you may wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replace that animal in the above argument with a small or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-verbal child.  I think that we ought to still consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this to be logical behavior.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, dog awareness is rather interestingly higher than most
<br>
people expect. A friend of mine has a rather smart dog. Last Easter,
<br>
when the kids' easter eggs were filled with candy and hidden in the
<br>
yard, and the family was in the kitchen (where my friend has a monitor
<br>
for the security camera that scans across his yard), the dog was
<br>
observed coming to the kitchen door every minute to make sure that
<br>
everybody was still in the kitchen. He would then go out in the yard
<br>
and sniff out a hidden easter egg and raid its contents, only to return
<br>
to the porch to determine that everybody was still in the kitchen and
<br>
his poaching had not raised any alarm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Formal logic, on the other hand, arises when there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious awareness not only of the logic that is occurring,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also of its formal aspect.  On this reading, most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (even the most intelligent) are unaware of formal logic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never resort to it.  Many highly intelligent people are even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to solve rather abstract puzzles such as the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     State the logical conclusion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           (1) No ducks waltz
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           (2) No officers ever decline to waltz
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           (3) All my poultry are ducks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They solve it several methods, one of which is a rapid &quot;trial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and error&quot; of quickly generating and testing hypotheses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which Popper and others have elevated to the key principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind evolutionary epistemology (and PCR).  Another is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to employ a kind of visualization similar to the manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Venn-diagrams, to get a &quot;feel&quot; for what is the needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.  Yet others seize at random upon pairs of sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to extract---if possible---simple syllogisms of the sort &quot;if A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Syllogisms are useful, but only if one takes into consideration all
<br>
significant variables. You did not in the above example, which is why
<br>
it's conclusion is nonsensical. Therefore, your alleged disproof fails
<br>
to demonstrate logic of its own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (The latter method shows that by taking (3), then applying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1), and finally comparing that result with (2), the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly obtains.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But logicians can cast each of (1), (2), and (3) into sentences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the predicate calculus, which includes quantifiers &quot;for all&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;there exists&quot;, and solve such problems symbolically.  I say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this is what should be taken as meant by &quot;formal logic&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aristotle practically invented formal logic, at least in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my opinion, and yet long before Aristotle mathematicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were solving geometry problems that required little more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than pure logic.  And far before them, chiefs, shamans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters, and family wranglers had also employed logic IMO,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just not formal logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally, then, a tiny bit of Western mathematics, but no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western science should be said to be based upon formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, since all real science is based on mathematics, your
<br>
conclusion fails.
