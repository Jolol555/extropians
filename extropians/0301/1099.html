</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NPR's  radio program THIS AMERICAN LIFE for January 10th was titled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Secret Government&quot; and included an interview with Jose Padilla's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer, Donna Newman. Ms. Newman was informed that she was no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mr. Padilla's lawyer, because Mr. Padilla had been classified as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; and moved to a military prison where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was being held indefinitely, despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that he had not been charged with any crime.
</em><br>
<p>The only real problem I have with Mr Padilla's treatment is that
<br>
because he is an 'unlawful' combatant, it is rather obvious that he has
<br>
(or is suspected of having) therefore broken some law of combat. A
<br>
lawful combatant has no need of a lawyer only because s/he engaged in
<br>
combat in a lawful manner. 
<br>
<p>This being said, the laws Mr. Padilla broke are not civillian laws, of
<br>
which Ms. Newman is trained for, but military laws of warfare, for
<br>
which she is unqualified to represent Mr. Padilla.
<br>
<p>Since this all makes Mr. Padilla a war criminal, and since generally
<br>
war criminals are not put on trial until after a war is concluded
<br>
*(unless they are summarily executed on or near the battlefield)*, it
<br>
makes sense that Mr. Padilla will only need a lawyer when and if war
<br>
crimes trials are held. In the meantime, holding him indefinitely as a
<br>
war criminal should only require that he is allowed visitation by the
<br>
Red Cross to ensure his fair treatment, until such time as we decide to
<br>
try him or summarily execute him (both options are legal under the
<br>
Geneva Conventions).
