</em><br>
______
<br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Clearly ExI has principles (at least of a sort) - The Extropian
</em><br>
Principles.&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Take this quote from the front page:&lt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Extropianism is a transhumanist philosophy. The Extropian
</em><br>
Principles define a specific version or &quot;brand&quot; of transhumanist
<br>
thinking. Like humanists, transhumanists favor (sic) reason,
<br>
progress, and values centred on our well being rather than on an
<br>
external religious authority.&quot;&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does ExI have a position as a lobby group?&lt;
</em><br>
_______
<br>
<p>Not currently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I interpreted Natasha's statements as saying in particular that Exi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;has no political affiliations. eg: it has no association with any formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Libertarian groups.
</em><br>
________
<br>
<p>Borader please! &quot;eg: it has no association with any formal *political*
<br>
groups.&quot;  Remember, there are many extropians and members of ExI who are
<br>
not libertarian. Hello.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I understand that to be the case too, but there are at least two &quot;forms&quot;
</em><br>
of politics. The one that most people think of may be the Democrats
<br>
vs Republicans (in the US).&lt;
<br>
________
<br>
<p>A wee bit broader please. Greens are growing more and more each year. 
<br>
Greens and Libertarians are substantial secondary political groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But my point is that whenever people gather especially when decisions
</em><br>
need to be made about priorities and allocating resources there is
<br>
politics.&lt;
<br>
_______
<br>
<p>Politics of this sort are social politics and more based on ideological
<br>
discussions with some philosophy and religion tossed in, don't you think? 
<br>
I mean, if politics, formally is &quot;the art or science of government&quot; and
<br>
also &quot;the sympathies of a person&quot; and even &quot;the total complex of relations
<br>
between people living in society&quot;. (<a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary">http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary</a>) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Further, even though many Extropians might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;libertarian, or social democrat, or conservative, these leanings are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;orthogonal to being Extropian, and Exi in turn has no bias in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;political dimension, as it does not involve itself in such.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;By the political dimension I'm reading its neither for or against
</em><br>
particular political parties that specifically seek government such
<br>
as the Democracts and Republicans. I don't think it should by
<br>
in that sort of politic either.&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;This doesn't mean that it couldn't talk about having political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;opponents, couldn't lobby political groups, or otherwise engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the political landscape in representing Extropy. It's just that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not a political party in and of itself, and doesn't desire to be.
</em><br>
__________
<br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Having gone through Natasha's Pro-Act presentation, I can now
</em><br>
see that some thought has been given to competitors in the meme-
<br>
scape.&lt;
<br>
________
<br>
<p>This was my objective.  But, it was a lot of thought -:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I still thing that the questions I raised run orthogonal to these
</em><br>
points though.&lt;
<br>
________
<br>
<p>Just like orthogonal's etymology, there are many cross-sections.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;But I could be wrong. :-)&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Just don't go thinking you've got an exclusive on that terrain :-)&lt;
</em><br>
_________
<br>
<p>Excuse me, can we share please? I've earned some of that terrain :-)
<br>
<p>Natasha
