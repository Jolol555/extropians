<p>
Speaking from Canada we see a lot of value to having at least one  military power
<br>
able to keep peace in the world.  When Russia was a power and their were 2
<br>
superpowers, too many military resources were put towards MAD (mutually assured
<br>
destruction).
<br>
<p>The greatest spin-off from the military is technology.  The key is to keep the
<br>
resources allocated to military funded technology focused to development and testing
<br>
with the commercialization phase done in the private sector.
<br>
EX-GPS.  The civilian system now uses  military developed  technology.  I suspect
<br>
that a completely private venture capital R&amp;D and deployment, debugging program
<br>
would never have had enough cash flow to become reality.
<br>
Similarly, now the mobile intenet,  intelligent attack systems, specialized light
<br>
weight, electric powered
<br>
vehicle funding list (95 billionUSD) will lead to  civilian commercialization
<br>
opportunities.
<br>
<p>The war part and the long cold-war stockpiling of weapons part are stupid wastes of
<br>
valuable resources, however.
<br>
<p>There is no need for Europe to try to copy the USA in a military sense.  Someone has
<br>
to be the brains that keeps the brawn from blowing itself and everyone else to
<br>
kingdom come.
<br>
<p>The USA embodies some of the best and worst of humanity.  The key is balancing each
<br>
and focusing towards useful goals.
<br>
<p>Japan , Canada and Europe have been able to create better average standards of
<br>
living for their citizens than the USA.  That has been the peace dividend.  The USA
<br>
has a disproportionately higher empoverished class than the  EU, Canada or Japan.
<br>
Socialism may squander resources on social programs but infant mortality in Canada
<br>
is 7/10,000  VS Iraq @ 210/10,000.
<br>
<p>EX-The new intelligence systems being developed for military use will eventually
<br>
make the delivery of  healthcare management more efficient.
<br>
<p>To conclude, we in Canada will not be displacing social development resources to
<br>
fuel world military
<br>
games except when there is a proven  real danger to the future of civilization and
<br>
not just somebody out on a chest thumping expedition.
<br>
<p>For this attitude, we too get the USA pissed off at us occaisionally.  The aide to
<br>
our Prime Minister called Bush a moron.  I'm sure they think we do some idiotic
<br>
things too. Life goes on.
<br>
