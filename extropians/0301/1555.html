Mike Lorrey beautifully explains
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Could someone knowledgeable start a thread on &quot;oil economics&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wouldn't a Western takeover of Iraq just put the oil at market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prices, (to the main betterment of Europe)?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; While the US satisfies the majority of its oil needs via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domestic reserves, and much of the rest via Mexico and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Venezuela, this is not in a vacuum.  The oil market is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global market, and a restriction of middle eastern supplies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Europe causes Europe to bid on oil from Mexico and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Venezuela, thus raising their prices.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I had figured out this much.  How could it be otherwise
<br>
in a global market?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By keeping the US from replacing the Iraq government (and thus causing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq to freely produce oil at Pre-Gulf War levels), Europe keeps oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices artificially raised.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  (I cut a part of Mike's response where he explained
<br>
why European governments with their large welfare states and
<br>
heavy financially reliance on over-priced gasoline and high
<br>
taxes have no particular incentive to see the price of oil drop.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oil prices in a free Iraq world would be around $10/bbl.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are currently around $30/bbl, partly due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restriction on Iraqi oil exports, partly on the Venezuelan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil conflict (which can also be traced to left wing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations), and partly on global uncertainty over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future US actions in Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe has a vested domestic interest in keeping the US from liberating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq, in that if oil prices drop to $10/bbl in a post-Saddam world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; European oil/gas tax revenues will drop precipitously, US products will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drop in cost faster than European products, leading to reductions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; European exports and increases in imports from the US,
</em><br>
<p>Double whammy!  So you are saying that one result of a drop
<br>
to $10/barrel will be that oil/gas tax revenues will fall.
<br>
This I understand; it would provoke a fiscal crisis for their
<br>
governments.
<br>
<p>But what I don't follow here is why the European products' costs
<br>
wouldn't also drop along with the oil and gas prices.  Yet that
<br>
is what you are saying, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...causing increases in unemployment, decreases in income taxes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and widespread domestic unrest.  Governments will be forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit social welfare services, causing greater unrest, or else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [increase] taxes, causing unrest and capital flight.
</em><br>
<p>I see how it all fits together now.  Thanks for the explanation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the end, it will spell a further condemnation of socialist policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Europe, and an endorsement of free market US policies.  Socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parties in power across Europe cannot let this happen as a matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own survival in power.
</em><br>
<p>Here is the rest of your message about a link between global
<br>
warming and oil.  Quite amazing.

<p>----------------------------Original Message----------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is interesting is the oil economics if you dovetail it with global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warming politics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a fact that the countries which are the biggest proponents of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories of catastrophic anthropic global warming are also those with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the largest a) welfare social state apparatus, and b) degrees of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxation of fossil fuels which are spent on that welfare state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have stated on occasion that it is my belief that this is the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because this high degree of social welfare, from socialized national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health care to unemployment and education subsidies in these countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puts their economies at a competitive disadvantage to more free market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations like the US, which enjoys relatively low fossil fuel taxation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and limited social welfare. These countries want global governmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions to the alleged greenhouse effect in order to force us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement similar high fossil fuel taxes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does this apply to the Iraq situation? While the US satisfies the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of its oil needs via domestic reserves, and much of the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via Mexico and Venezuela, this is not in a vacuum. The oil market is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global market, and a restriction of middle eastern supplies to Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes Europe to bid on oil from Mexico and Venezuela, thus raising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their prices.

</em><br>

<em>&gt; partly on global uncertainty over future US actions in Iraq.

<em>&gt; domestic unrest. Governments will be forced to drastically limit social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welfare services, causing greater unrest, or else drastic increases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes, causing unrest and capital flight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the end, it will spell a further condemnation of socialist policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Europe, and an endorsement of free market US policies. Socialist
