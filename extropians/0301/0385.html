Subject: U.S. Had Key Role in Iraq Buildup...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Notice the section stating that the &quot;administrations of Ronald Reagan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and George H.W. Bush authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous items that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had both military and civilian applications, including poisonous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as anthrax and bubonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plague.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>This should not be allowed to just drop off our
<br>
radar screens.  Either the U.S. did or did not
<br>
authorize the sale of deadly biological viruses
<br>
to a third-world country.

<em>&gt; Trade in Chemical Arms Allowed Despite Their Use on Iranians, Kurds
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; By Michael Dobbs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington Post Staff Writer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monday, December 30, 2002; Page A01
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; High on the Bush administration's list of justifications for war against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq are President Saddam Hussein's use of chemical weapons, nuclear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological programs, and his contacts with international terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What U.S. officials rarely acknowledge is that these offenses date back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a period when Hussein was seen in Washington as a valued ally.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Among the people instrumental in tilting U.S. policy toward Baghdad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war was Donald H. Rumsfeld, now defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secretary, whose December 1983 meeting with Hussein as a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presidential envoy paved the way for normalization of U.S.-Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relations. Declassified documents show that Rumsfeld traveled to Baghdad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at a time when Iraq was using chemical weapons on an &quot;almost daily&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis in defiance of international conventions.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as anthrax and bubonic

</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfers be punished for putting America in danger?  What do you think?
