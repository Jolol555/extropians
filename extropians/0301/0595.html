<p>How is this relevant?  Politics grows out of philosophy, is an 
<br>
offshoot of Ethics, to be more exact.  They aren't exactly 
<br>
orthogonal.  But I don't see why you bring this up here.  You 
<br>
have made a claim that you want to get rid of the b-word because 
<br>
you consider it both philosophically and more specifically 
<br>
politically unsound.  You have alluded to various 
<br>
epistemological (more philosophy) arguments in the process.  Now 
<br>
, as your point doesn't seem to be catching on, you seem to want 
<br>
to distance yourself from any philosophical aspects and claim it 
<br>
is only a question of practical politics?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't mean to be harsh, disrespectful or unkind, but sometimes
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; voter becomes politically irrelevant but 'cops' the laws anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Usually when people start out telling how they don't mean to be 
<br>
harsh, disrespectful or unkind they intend to be exactly that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to me to be a pretty good philosopher. In the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might expect to have many of my errors and misperceptions
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking  &quot;there are more things on heaven and earth....&quot;     
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree.  There are more things and more important ones that 
<br>
this endless running of the word &quot;belief&quot; into the ground.
