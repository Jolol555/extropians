<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20rooting%20for%20the%20Americans">samantha@objectent.com</a> writes: If they believed your own highly inflammatory 
<br>
anti-Islamic rhetoric represented the political opinion of the West 
<br>
generally, then the certainly would turn anti-Western -- in self defense.  
<br>
Disowning an entire major religious group (the largest one) and its adherents 
<br>
and cultures outright and declaring them en masse &quot;the enemy&quot; is a very ugly 
<br>
thing as I am sure you are quite aware of.
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You made some good points.  But, they need some tweaking.  The Islamic 
<br>
world is truly anti-Western.  True, a high percentage of Moslems are good and 
<br>
decent people.  The problem is that the fundamentalists are a violent group 
<br>
and they rule the roost through fear.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamentalists do not like the way our women dress, behave or 
<br>
think.  They consider the way our males dress to be indecent.  They do not 
<br>
like it that we have a secular government.  A government in their eyes should 
<br>
be Islamic.  If you go through the middle east you won't find a single 
<br>
government that is not either Islamic or a dictatorship -- there are no 
<br>
democracies.  They are totally against our banking system.  They write 
<br>
letters asking the religious scholars if it is okay to have intercourse with 
<br>
their female captives or must they limit themselves to their wives?  They ask 
<br>
about the religious consequences of dressing as we do in order to blend in 
<br>
and be employed?  They ask if and under what conditions it is permissible to 
<br>
speak to Western women in ordinary business conversations?  Should they 
<br>
permit their hand to be shook during an introduction by a woman?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remember a great deal of this turmoil was predicted several 
<br>
years ago by Thomas L. Friedman in his book about The Olive Tree and the 
<br>
Lexus.  Modernity is placing a tremendous strain on the Middle Eastern 
<br>
culture.  What seems to be happening is that a culture war is occurring.  
<br>
They see themselves as a great people and modernity is destroying their 
<br>
world.  A controlling percentage of them are lashing out violently to destroy 
<br>
the culture that is destroying theirs.
