the Mujahadeen received from the United States, China, and Israel? 
<br>
Naaaaaaaah. Couldn't be. The US just got lucky. It must have been a fluke! 
<br>
Well, we know that intervention in Iraq will certainly lead to mass 
<br>
casualties for our troops, just like it did in the Gulf War...Oh wait...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Taliban was supposed to inflict mass casualties and 
<br>
humiliate the US, as had occurred when the Soviets attempted to conquer that 
<br>
nation and when the US intervened in Vietnam. And we all know that the 
<br>
&quot;heroic&quot; North Vietnamese Communists &quot;defeated&quot; the United States all by 
<br>
their lonesomeâ€¦:)
<br>
<p>Max,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admire your ability to enunciate so precisely when your 
<br>
tongue is planted firmly in your cheek.  In Afghanistan they were going to 
<br>
run in and out of caves confusing us.  They never thought that we had seen 
<br>
that trick pulled on the Soviets.  We did what the Soviets didn't do for some 
<br>
reason.  We watched from the air to learn where the caves were and then we 
<br>
sealed the caves with them inside.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime if you want to see another letter from fantasy land 
<br>
read the following one from Kai:
<br>
&quot;1) Stop dealing with evil regimes just because they suit your needs.  Stop 
<br>
the double measure. Stop calling everyone enemy just because he doesn't share 
<br>
you opinion. Instead protect and support movements for democracy and human 
<br>
rights.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;## Yep, Mom, Chevrolet and Apple Pie, that is what we need.  We 
<br>
explain to Kai over and over.  He can't refute our points so he just ignores 
<br>
us and continues using the same old arguments.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember my writing him a long explanation of the American electoral 
<br>
process, of how we count votes.  I explained to him that legally it is the 
<br>
electoral votes that count and that we mostly quit counting the popular votes 
<br>
as soon as the electoral vote is positively determined.  As a consequence no 
<br>
one actually knows who won the popular vote.  We know who won the electoral 
<br>
vote and we know who was winning the popular vote at the time we arbitrarily 
<br>
quit counting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess what, he is already back to making that charge today.  He is 
<br>
attempting to prove that our President is illegal.  And he claims to be our 
<br>
friend.
