<p>&nbsp;This would be something great to have in a Wiki.  All of the
<br>
participents extropic priorities and how they are choosing to persue and
<br>
act upon them in the coming year.  
<br>
<p>This not only gives newcomers an illustration as to what's important to
<br>
other Extropians but it gives them an idea on how to apply Extropian
<br>
principles in their lives!
<br>
<p>I think the mailing list is a great way to diseminate ideas.  Many of
<br>
the ideas provide hope for a better world tomorrow.  But only a small
<br>
percent offer the individual a chance to participate.  What the Wiki
<br>
could provide is a list of ways that Extropian principles could be acted
<br>
upon.
<br>
<p>The difference between talkers and doers is often having the knowledge
<br>
to know where/how to start doing!

Subject: Talking vs. doing
<br>
<p><p><p><p>I've had a couple of off list exchanges over the last day
<br>
or so that have in some ways enlightened me and in some
<br>
ways depressed me.
<br>
<p>As some of you know, I sometimes go into &quot;rant mode&quot;, in
<br>
part to get people to sit up and do some self-examination.
<br>
You can label this message semi-rant mode.
<br>
<p>I'm on the board of the Extropy Institute.  I'm one of the
<br>
more frequent contributers to the list (because I have
<br>
more free time than most of the other board members).
<br>
<p>As I've explained to some people off-list recently I'm
<br>
always *forcing* myself to face extropic priorities.
<br>
How can I call myself an &quot;extropian&quot; or consider myself
<br>
to be a responsible board member if I do not do that
<br>
as often as I can look at myself in the mirror?
<br>
<p>So how do I set up my extropic priorities?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging, malnutrition/starvation (perhaps poverty), AIDS, Malaria,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps murderous tyrants, ...
<br>
<p>I take them in a very rigid line of what destroys the most concentrated
<br>
information (e.g. human lives) each year.  (This is not guaranteed to be
<br>
the best approach -- one could take an approach that tries to save the
<br>
greatest number of future lives which might result in a much different
<br>
weighting.)  But it *is* an approach that I can look at, put some
<br>
numbers on and evaluate the extropic &quot;return-on-investment&quot; that I may
<br>
be receiving.
<br>
<p>In my (perfect) world we would be allocating resources
<br>
to defeat these problems on a pro rata basis -- to the
<br>
extent of the problem so should be the resources devoted
<br>
to solving them.  I realize that is an idealistic perspective but it
<br>
forces one to examine &quot;How close does my &quot;personal&quot; allocation of
<br>
resources come to an optimal allocation that I would like to see for
<br>
solving the problems?&quot;.
<br>
<p>I am forced into a conclusion that the ExI mailing list
<br>
is pretty far from that ideal.  In large part because many
<br>
of the conversations do not focus on a couple of key questions.
<br>
(1) Will my making these comments make any real difference?
<br>
(2) Will the comments produce some &quot;activity&quot; that results
<br>
in progress on the &quot;extropic&quot; scale (either the one I've defined for
<br>
myself or your own personal scale)?
<br>
<p>If you do not answer those questions before you hit the reply key, then
<br>
I don't think you can legitimately consider oneself an extropian.  You
<br>
don't have to answer the questions affirmatively but one does need to
<br>
engage in some self-examination as to one is adding &quot;signal&quot; to the list
<br>
or whether one is producing nothing but noise.  And then adding &quot;signal&quot;
<br>
is perhaps not enough -- is that signal going to produce concrete
<br>
changes in reality?  If it doesn't produce concrete changes in reality
<br>
(presumably of an extropic nature) then *why* the f*** are you wasting
<br>
your time posting to this list if for any other reason to listen to
<br>
oneself go mumble mumble mumble?
<br>
<p>The question is &quot;Do you merely want to be right?&quot; or &quot;Do you want to see
<br>
reality (really) change?&quot;.  If you want to see reality (really) change
<br>
it is probably not going to be by debates &amp; postings to the extropian
<br>
list -- it is going to be by getting away from the extropian list and
<br>
discovering avenues that produce real action.
<br>
<p>My 2 cents, semi-rant mode off.
<br>
