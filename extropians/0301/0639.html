<br>
give us pause that we support and use such persons and tactics when it suits 
<br>
our desires and then condemn as if they are utterly depraved and that we 
<br>
should obliterate them from the face of the earth in the next mood and set of 
<br>
purposes that hit us.  It might even stir us to a bit deeper reflection 
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you agree and then proceed immediately to another attack on the US 
<br>
and its motives.  Would it wreck your world view to suddenly realise that 
<br>
Americans just like other people sometimes make a mistake and this has long 
<br>
since caused Americans to be stirred &quot;to a bit deeper reflection.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry S. Truman once made a comment that was not intended the way it 
<br>
was taken and the result was the Korean War.  Was he not allowed to correct 
<br>
his statement?   Were we allowed to help the South Koreans despite what 
<br>
Truman had said?
