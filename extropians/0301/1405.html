From: Robert J. Bradbury [mailto:<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=RE:%20Talking%20vs.%20doing">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; As I've explained to some people off-list recently I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always *forcing* myself to face extropic priorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can I call myself an &quot;extropian&quot; or consider myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a responsible board member if I do not do that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as often as I can look at myself in the mirror?
</em><br>
<p>This is a great post, Robert.  I think that in virtually any area of
<br>
human interest, it's easier to &quot;talk the talk&quot; than &quot;walk the walk&quot;.
<br>
Nor is there a clean distinction between talkers vs. doers.  We all
<br>
talk to some extent and we all do to some extent.
<br>
<p>For me, the last 7 years of lurking on the extropy list have been
<br>
quite beneficial.  I believe they've increased global extropy in the
<br>
present.  I also believe they constitute a great investment that will
<br>
pay back extropic dividends in the future as I increase my sphere of
<br>
personal influence and can put the extropic learning I've done to
<br>
greater use.
<br>
<p>This list has provided me with a steady stream of news, facts,
<br>
arguments, and insights that have been invaluable.  Every time I find
<br>
myself in an offlist conversation touching on one of these topics,
<br>
global extropy increases because I'm more able to spread extropic
<br>
memes.  If I'm able to finish my book and publish it, global extropy
<br>
will again increase, and again partially do to this list.
<br>
<p>Stepping back from myself I see three ways that extropians can
<br>
significantly increase global extropy:
<br>
<p>1) Contribute directly through the scientific research or technical
<br>
work that you do.  (I think quite a number of the people on this list
<br>
hit this one.)
<br>
<p>2) Contribute to the spread of extropic memes and the public adoption
<br>
of extropic policy.  There are lots of ways to accomplish this -
<br>
conversations with non-extropians, voting your philosophy, writing
<br>
op-ed pieces, publishing ideas on the web, writing magazine articles
<br>
and books, activism for extropic political causes, and more.
<br>
<p>The above is really all about &quot;talk&quot;.  Rather than talk amongst
<br>
ourselves though, it's about talking to the wider world and helping
<br>
plant and nourish extropian memes there.  The extropians list may give
<br>
us ammunition that is useful in spreading extropian memes, but it's up
<br>
to us to actually use that ammunition.
<br>
<p>3) Increase the extropy of your own life by continually improving your
<br>
intelligence, your knowledge base, your health, and your optimism.  
<br>
<p>Frankly, the application of extropy to one's personal life is the area
<br>
where I'm most skeptical of extropians.  Perhaps this is unjust, but
<br>
my perception is that quite a number of us are willing and able to
<br>
talk about extropian concepts until we're blue, and may contribute
<br>
professionally or academically to the increase in global extropy, but
<br>
neglect our own personal extropian sphere.  How many people here
<br>
exercise daily?  How many meditate?  How many use nootropics or can
<br>
give an informed opinion as to they're not worthwhile?  How many are
<br>
engaged in continuing education of ourselves in more than an ad-hoc
<br>
way?
<br>
<p>I'm no paragon of personal extropy myself.  I go through spurts of
<br>
personal growth followed by fallow periods.  Perhaps a better question
<br>
is:  how can we support each other in increasing our own personal
<br>
extropy?  I've experimented with various mechanisms for this in my
<br>
offlist social circle.  Is there something we can do on a larger scale
<br>
for all interested extropians?
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
