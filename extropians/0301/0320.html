<p>Hmm, what about Rome? Rome was hardly a cosmopolitian and creative place 
<br>
until it already had an empire, and even the romans themselves 
<br>
considered Greek culture far superior intellectually. Yet they 
<br>
tenaciously conquered everything there was to conquer, long before they 
<br>
became more advanced than the surrounding etruscean tribes. 
<br>
<p>Today dominance is more about creativity than raw force and 
<br>
tenaciousness (although the later is important). That is because the 
<br>
creative advantage is likely greater when you trade than when you fight. 
<br>
And if dominance is defined as memetic superiority, then creativity is 
<br>
obviously important. From that perspective the greeks conquered the 
<br>
romans and the chinese the mongols.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you look at history, the societies who properties molded the most usable 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtract from the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.	High Encouragement of Individuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.	Little Social Exclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3.	Shared Social Value Complexes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4.	Almost No limits of Information
</em><br>
<p>I think you have emphasized the best memeticists too much - creative 
<br>
societies harness the creative power of the whole population. Most 
<br>
people might not be very creative most of the time, but if you allow 
<br>
that creativity to flourish and be expressed, and then have amplifying 
<br>
institutions like free markets or public agoras it can still be selected 
<br>
for. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking psychologically do these have an impact on creative thought? Does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number 4 by itself cause creative thought?
</em><br>
<p>According to my psychology readings, it is necessary for creativity, but 
<br>
it does not cause it. If you are limited or pennalised for creativity 
<br>
you will not express it (and in the long run think less creatively). 
<br>
<p>The shared values part is doubtful; it might be necessary to hold a 
<br>
society together, but it seems that more creolized and diverse societies 
<br>
produce more creative thought than homogeneous societies. This fits in 
<br>
with 2. 
<br>
<p>In Gert Hofstede's terms, high power distance and uncertainty avoidance 
<br>
impairs creativity. Individualism likely supports creativity, and also 
<br>
correlates with GDP.
<br>
<p>However, cause and effect in this field are complex. See

<br>
for an interesting study and discussion.
