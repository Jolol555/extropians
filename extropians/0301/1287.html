Christian &quot;naddy&quot; Weisgerber
<br>
&lt;&lt;Which has been highly problematic from the very beginning.  One
<br>
group's terrorists are somebody else's freedom fighters.  See the
<br>
pained faces in the Western countries when the Russians immediately
<br>
hopped on the train, pointing to their own fight against terrorism
<br>
in the shape of the war in Chechnya.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Putin and company demand a war against Muslim Chechnya while courting Saddam 
<br>
and pursuing a policy that does anything it can, to romance the Islamic 
<br>
World. Russia can't have it both ways. The decision thus becomes digital; 
<br>
yes-no, off-on, war-peace.  France is very similar to this, as is much of 
<br>
western Europe. For example, the French populace howls against North African 
<br>
and Muslim immigrants; suffers occasionally from Islamist terror actions, yet 
<br>
its foreign policy is Arabist, to the extreme. A policy, incidentally, 
<br>
started by De Gaulle, at the suggestion of his chief foreign minister (pursue 
<br>
Iraq as you would a women!), who was an ardent supporter of hitler and a 
<br>
member of the Vichey government.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Indeed.  It would be so much nicer if the US government, as well
<br>
as the American nationalists loudmouthing on this list, would stand
<br>
up and declare:
<br>
1. We pursue our own interests.
<br>
2. We are the fucking leading military and economic power on this
<br>
   planet, we do as we please because we can.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I have no problem with this statement, although there are other factors, such 
<br>
as&quot;
<br>
<p>3. Your people weren't attacked on 9-11, and ours were. This is a good reason 
<br>
(arrogantly speaking) to re-draw the maps of the Islamic world. I mean its 
<br>
not set in stone and borders and nations were put together by post WW1 
<br>
Britain and France.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Not to mention that I find Mr. Bush's persistent references to
<br>
&quot;God&quot; in his rhetorics eerily similar to those of Mr. Bin Laden.
<br>
This is a point where American sensibilities diverge sharply from
<br>
European ones.)  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, Osama, and his fellow Islamists' version of Gawd* demand sacrifces-of 
<br>
non-Islamists. For example, because of such views, one cannot have a beauty 
<br>
contest in Nigeria (how tragic!) because of enraging Islamist sensibilities 
<br>
(200 dead Christians from the riots).
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Well, it's far from clear that leaving Hussein in power will be
<br>
less deleterious.  The whole area is so fucked up, we just don't
<br>
know.&gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>True, but Europe was such a fucked-up place, not so long ago. You couldn't 
<br>
keep Germany from France's throat, and also Poland. Curiously, when the time 
<br>
for repressing tyrants came in the Balkans wars of 1991, Western Europe was 
<br>
reluctant, to the extreme, in involving themselves in halting such a 
<br>
conflict. Clinton was also a believer in euro-style diplomacy, and this cost 
<br>
250,000 lives, did it not? It wasn't until President Billy started dropping 
<br>
weaponry on Milosevic's army that things cooled-down. (Balkans war 2)
<br>
<p>Germans are forever telling Americans to &quot;go clean your own front stoop!&quot;, I 
<br>
believe this phrase is(?). Well, Yugo was a chance for Europe to clean their 
<br>
own from stoop, and basically, it was standing around with thumbs planted up 
<br>
the butt. Proving that again, diplomacy without power, is sizzle without the 
<br>
steak, or tofu, as such.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Now let me suck up in part to the kill-em-all-crowd here and annoy
<br>
their opponents by pointing out that I'm neutral on the issue of a
<br>
US war (with or without British and French support) against Iraq.
<br>
Apart from the oil price, I'm not personally impacted.  It will be
<br>
just another video clip war, pretty pictures on TV of people blowing
<br>
each other to smithereens.  It's not me dying out there, nor anybody
<br>
I'm close to.  And I sure as hell can't do anything about it either way.--

<br>
<p>Yes indeed, human self-centeredness is typical. But also, I see no need for 
<br>
Europe to become involved in this war either. Nor are the Europeans to be 
<br>
heeded on what they say, because, if one is not in the card  game, one 
<br>
doesn't get the deal ;-)
<br>
<p>I love the smell of burning arrogance in the morning !
