<br>
(World==America==USA ?) Actually I thought that America is the big continent 
<br>
composed of South and North America.
<br>
<p>Rudiger,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That comment has been made many times by many people that also live on 
<br>
the Continent of America.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never deny there are other besides us on this continent.  However 
<br>
we are the Country of America as we are the only one to my knowledge that 
<br>
featured that name in naming our country.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also used other names for ourselves in our beginnings and still do. 
<br>
&nbsp;For example some of us used to call ourselves Columbia.  That has an obvious 
<br>
conflict so most of us leave that other Columbia exclusive use.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose there are other examples but suffice it to say that we 
<br>
settled on calling ourselves Americans for reasons that seemed worthy at 
<br>
then.  At the time we were small &amp; weak, no one else seemed to want the name. 
<br>
&nbsp;If you don't mind we will continue the practice. &lt;Smile&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to Germany doing business with Iraq.  That is a charge I have heard 
<br>
made in all seriousness.  The people seemed to have the facts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me go back in time.  You as a German probably don't have a 
<br>
full grasp how thoroughly your people have penetrated this society nor how 
<br>
far back in our history that occurred.  For example when we first became a 
<br>
nation and chose a language for ourselves German was the largest single 
<br>
ethnic group we had.  However they were outnumbered by the English, Irish &amp; 
<br>
Scots (all speaking English) so you lost the decision.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you study your own history you will no doubt note that famine swept 
<br>
the &quot;Rhine Valley&quot; in the early 1700s and later about 1760.  I believe this 
<br>
was due to warfare.  I would like to be more precise than to say the &quot;Rhine 
<br>
Valley&quot; but I have never seen the area defined any more exactly than that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of all that history when I left the farm in 1951 I moved 
<br>
to St. Louis, MO.  That city is known for its German population.  The Germans 
<br>
started coming early and kept coming until fairly recently.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first employer was a machine shop ran by a family of recent German 
<br>
emigrants.  I have sat many times listening to them describe how Germany 
<br>
traded across the battle lines during the First World War.  To be 
<br>
forthcoming, usually the trade was three sided.  But, everyone understood 
<br>
what was going on.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at history you will find Germany doing trade when it was 
<br>
necessary or in its best interest during the Second World War.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may tell me that you do not do those things nor know anything 
<br>
about such.  If so -- you seem a gentleman, I accept your word.  However, 
<br>
never doubt there are others that do trade.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember this, it was NYC not Berlin that lost roughly 3000 people to 
<br>
attack.  Based on our best information we believe Iraq and some others are 
<br>
part and parcel of the group that supported that attack or represent a threat 
<br>
of further attack.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't wish to bully you or anyone.  We don't wish to disrupt your 
<br>
trade.  On the other hand we will continue to attack those that have attacked 
<br>
or threatened to attack us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We prefer to have your blessings and your assistance.  If not we are a 
<br>
sovereign nation and we will get the job done on our own.
<br>
Ron h.
