<br>
I make no claims myself about all this, merely noting that there is some
<br>
provocative and perhaps puzzling material reported. It is interesting that
<br>
the professional parapsychologists I know are fairly dismissive of Schwartz,
<br>
who unreservedly endorses the TV medium John Edward [?!].
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I was at a large &quot;show&quot; featuring John (psychic boy) Edwards. He was very 
<br>
unimpressive in his cold readings, and despite the disclaimers of his TV 
<br>
show, it appears to me that the show is edited to force Edwards to seem as a 
<br>
real psychic boy.  
<br>
<p>Despite Edwards claims of paranormal powers, Edwards could not predict that a 
<br>
child's foot would be trapped in an escalator, in the auditorium in which 
<br>
Edwards was appearing. Edwards was not able to forecast that it was my 
<br>
brother in law, who would be attending to the child, when auditorium 
<br>
personnel yelled for a doctor. The boy was subsequently taken to a hospital 
<br>
emergency room. Some psychic. It also seemed that Edwards had &quot;schills&quot; 
<br>
planted in the audience, after his lack of effective contact with the &quot;other 
<br>
side&quot; appeared to fall through.
