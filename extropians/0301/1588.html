<p>[snip]
<br>
<p>I had the opportunity to witness the presenation by David Harrison today [1]
<br>
for which I had high hopes that I don't think were fullfilled.  I don't think
<br>
that he made the case for his premise sufficiently.
<br>
<p>However, he did bring up some of the IGF/GH/CR topics/issues extensively with
<br>
regard to various strains of mice.  This seems pretty unavoidable at this point.
<br>
Energy consumption and/or the regulation of energy consumption does seem to effect
<br>
longevity.
<br>
<p>Joao makes some very valid points regarding other physiological changes
<br>
that take place under CR.  I think the message here may be that aging
<br>
is a multi-factorial process (as the evolutionary biology of aging perspective
<br>
would suggest).  So &quot;low fat reserves&quot; may translate into some
<br>
extenstion in longevity.  Then we want to know *why* that is the case
<br>
and what else are we missing to explain the complimentary longevity
<br>
extending effects.
