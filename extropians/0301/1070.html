<p><em>&gt; Really I think it's just about whatever helps communication. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite right.  We probably have to try to be flexible.
<br>
I'll try to be more careful about using the right word; and
<br>
you (and the rest of us) can try harder to appreciate the
<br>
fallibility of communication, especially this form of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I might point out, however, that the whole adversarial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process of law is based upon opportunistic exploitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of these human tendencies. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might. But you haven't yet. It's an interesting thesis.
</em><br>
<p>I'll take that as a joke  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think that we should live with a balance between the utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rigorous and detached (and sometimes boring), and the visceral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. But I come to the extropian list and communicate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and others at least partly because I *like* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual rigor especially when it is applied to the solving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human problems. I can exercise my 'ol viscera anywhere.
</em><br>
<p>Well, others here perhaps come to the list (why do I feel
<br>
like breaking out in song?  &quot;Oh, Come to the List!!&quot; ?)
<br>
to express their feelings, and some come for a combination.
<br>
And most, of course, have no really good idea why they come,
<br>
nor should they have to have a reason.
<br>
<p>I myself don't want to entirely discard the emotional component,
<br>
partly because I don't feel like it, and partly because of
<br>
Damiaso's brilliant demonstration that the emotions are vital
<br>
to our reasoning in many cases.  I really must post his
<br>
experiment here, for those who haven't heard of it.
<br>
<p>For a pertinent example, the emotion we see in the thread
<br>
about Iraq has everything to do with people's feelings (well,
<br>
duh, I guess you can't argue with that!), and their feelings
<br>
are what took nature millions of years to develop as correct
<br>
responses to the world around them.  If some people hate
<br>
Saddam, or hate America, or love America, and if the rest
<br>
of us have partial feelings one way or the other, these may
<br>
have everything to do with unconscious calculation;  in
<br>
game theory, for example, it's easy to prove that sometimes
<br>
it's best to be *ir-rational*.  Nations, evidently, can have
<br>
feelings too, and it's all a part of the stew.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I digress.  Returning, I'll conclude by saying that
<br>
I want to entertain the hypothesis that even outbursts on 
<br>
this list may contain some ur-rational sense.  (No typo there.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Nature will take its course so far as list dynamics go,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just as in all other human affairs, and the prohibitionists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eventually wise up and understand that suggesting tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course corrections is one thing, and profitable, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revolutionary and radical programs are something else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and inevitably fail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Nature&quot; may impose limits. Our freedoms rise to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent we can push back those limits. So I don't want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to just say &quot;whatever will be, will be&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The thesis that revolutions and radical programs inevitably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fail seems a very bold one. I'm not inclined to agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it at this stage. 
</em><br>
<p>Yah, I'll take back the word &quot;inevitably&quot;; but notice
<br>
that moral campaigns are seldom more than slightly
<br>
successful---the case at hand is that your exhortations
<br>
to everyone to switch off the &quot;point scoring mindset&quot;
<br>
will definitely be futile---and hardly just because one
<br>
or two of us disagree with you---the vast number of posters,
<br>
if they read thread at all, will not have their behavior
<br>
affected by it.
<br>
<p>Still, I will agree that we should speak out every so often
<br>
when things seem too acerbic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I'm more concerned with *our*  &quot;flame wars&quot; because our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;flame wars&quot; are &quot;flame wars&quot; between the good-guys and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;burn&quot; *us*.  I think an enormous amount can be achieved thru
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the willing cooperation of a few good minds and this list is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a gold mine for good minds.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;8^D  *We* don't have flame wars.  If you think that
<br>
what you see here is ever anything like a real flame
<br>
war, then you haven't seen anything yet.
<br>
<p>Alas, I'm only one-fourth the way through your great long
<br>
post, but I'd better stop now.  I'll reply to the rest
<br>
later, when there is time.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
