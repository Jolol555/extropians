<em>&gt; &gt; How easy are Wikis to hook into other data flows? For example, is a

</em><br>
<p>True. I wasn't thinking complete as-is cross-posting. Say, for example, that
<br>
Wiki posts are sent to a mailing list (suitably auto-fake-quoting for
<br>
context), or put into a bulletin board under the same scheme. Replies to
<br>
those may or may not go back into the Wiki, depending on how you want to
<br>
work things and whether the Wiki maintains its own comments sections for
<br>
each entry or not.
<br>
<p>Posting to a Wiki is still, topologically, a conversation. So I think
<br>
they're viable things for some sort of inclusion in the planned grand
<br>
tranhumanist information exchange.
