<em>&gt;From the BBC

<p>US working on lightning weapon
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
Weapon could be tested on an unmanned aircraft (US Department of Defense)
<br>
<p>The US Air Force is working on developing a man-made bolt of lightning powerful enough to fry sophisticated computer and electronic components in weapons. 
<br>
Researchers are looking at ways of putting so-called High-Powered Microwave (HPM) beams on aircraft and cruise missiles. 
<br>
<p>The short, intense burst of energy is intended to be lethal to electronics but have no effect on people. 
<br>
<p>Aerospace experts have suggested an experimental version of the weapon could be used in a war against Iraq, carried on a cruise missile or unmanned aircraft. 
<br>
<p>But the secrecy surrounding the use of these weapons would mean it could be some time before details are released to the public. 
<br>
<p>Millions of watts 
<br>
<p>&quot;The low-collateral damage aspect of the technology makes high-power microwave weapons useful in a wide variety of missions where avoiding civilian casualties is a major concern,&quot; says the US Air Force on its website. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cruise missiles could be used for HPM weapons 
<br>
These weapons are particularly attractive as they could be used against suspected chemical or biological facilities in Iraq, without the danger of releasing dangerous toxins into the air. 
<br>
<p>On its website, the US Air Force says research in HPM weapons is &quot;considerably advanced&quot;. But it added that scientists are conducting &quot;critical experiments still needed to assess the feasibility of the technology for operational systems&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Much of the work into developing this next-generation weapon is being done at the High Energy Research and Technology Facility. 
<br>
<p>The $9m lab is located in a canyon in the Manzano Mountains, part of the remote Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. 
<br>
<p>Targeted microwaves 
<br>
<p>The technology behind HPM is based on that used in household microwave ovens. 
<br>
<p>But whereas a typical microwave generates less than 1,500 watts of power, the Air Force researchers are working with equipment that can generate millions of watts of power. 
<br>
<p>An HPM weapon would unleash a powerful electrical pulse that would burn up any electrical equipment, such as computers and communications systems. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Scientists are exploring equipment and methodologies for generating high-power microwave energy and accurately propagating that energy to a target,&quot; says the US Air Force. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Work is also ongoing on the feasibility and utility of placing compact high-power microwave systems aboard various Air Force platforms.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Aerospace experts say the research is well advanced and an experimental system could be placed on an unmanned drone or a cruise missile. 
<br>
<p>And US officials have hinted that new developmental weapons technology could be used in an attack on Iraq.
