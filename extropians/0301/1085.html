<em>&gt; You can also have a wiki with a comments section for each section (so

</em><br>
<p>If you want a threaded forum, use a threaded forum.
<br>
<p>If you want a wiki, use a wiki.
<br>
<p>Trying to make one behave like the other is defeating the purpose.  I
<br>
think I said that originally.
<br>
<p>A wikis as a means of communication has its own particular attributes
<br>
and emergent properties.  It's those exact things which make wikis so
<br>
attractive for certain purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, but you lose so much information by viewing it [without change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history].
</em><br>
<p>Not true.  You actually get so much more information because you have so
<br>
much less noise.  Each contributor/editor of a wiki page is given the
<br>
opportunity to add signal and/or remove noise.  A mature wiki is like a
<br>
container full of various sized pebbles that has been shaken for a long
<br>
time.  The large, coarse pieces at the top can get scraped off, leaving
<br>
behind only the end result of a lot of shaking and sifting ... a very
<br>
dense collection of many particles.
<br>
<p>The problem is that a wiki is really never &quot;fully matured&quot; so at any
<br>
given point in time, a glimpse at a wiki's contents will seem
<br>
half-organized and refined but half-haphazard -- those rough edges are
<br>
where contributors should look at to help refine.  As new ideas emerge,
<br>
they become new rough edges which eventually either get deleted or
<br>
branch off into their own wiki pages.
