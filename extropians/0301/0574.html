</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think so at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The proposition I am putting to you Lee is that there is a larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; issue here than the mere ontological point.  If we call the guy who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; made the original unmodified statement Tony-A and the one who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; made the modified statement Tony-B would you really have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preference over whether Tony-A or Tony-B was casting a vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on stem cell policy that was likely to directly effect the rate at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which treatments for a variety of diseases might be found and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ultimately cures might be found?.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps I would prefer to vote for [B] because his choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of words does, as has been pointed out, make it sound like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's less committed.  Also, there is a chance that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right about this individual, and what he means by &quot;I believe&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not &quot;I think&quot;, but &quot;I BELIEVE&quot;.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I might vote for [A] instead because the ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions displayed are *exactly* the same, and [A] is more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up-front about it.
</em><br>
<p>It seems like your vote is &quot;it depends&quot;. 
<br>
<p>But I don't see how the example can be made more elemental
<br>
than this. There is a difference between politics and philosophy
<br>
and I think we both know which process makes the laws. 
<br>
<p>I don't mean to be harsh, disrespectful or unkind, but sometimes
<br>
one just *has* to make a decision. In the political world when no
<br>
decision is made by a voter a decision is either deemed to have 
<br>
been made or the voter is deemed to have not voted. That non-
<br>
voter becomes politically irrelevant but 'cops' the laws anyway.
<br>
<p>You seem to me to be a pretty good philosopher. In the future
<br>
I might expect to have many of my errors and misperceptions
<br>
pointed out, to my real benefit, by you. But right now I'm 
<br>
thinking  &quot;there are more things on heaven and earth....&quot;     
<br>
<p>Perhaps if you reflect on your own goals and subgoals that you 
<br>
produced in response to a conversation with Eliezer, you will 
<br>
agree that you also need to be a politician to have the best chance
<br>
of realising *your* goals. 
<br>
<p>Increasing the chances of keeping us both alive (this may 
<br>
*sound* phoney, but it is actually true) in the real world where
<br>
laws are made as a result of political processes has actually
<br>
been a driver for my interest in this thread. I really don't have
<br>
the time for, though I do enjoy, mere philosophy. I also find it
<br>
harder to &quot;philosophize&quot; over the net. I get slowed down and 
<br>
I have to over-engineer my communication because I can't get
<br>
visual cues or tone of voice.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's just a little too bizarre that my approval would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply be a function of the particular words chosen.
</em><br>
<p>Words mean things. Words are exchanged socially. They have
<br>
&quot;baggage&quot;. It seems obvious to me. I don't think words are
<br>
particular simple. Consider the difficulties in producing natural
<br>
language translators. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (There is a notable exception to this:  ideological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positions can be and often are intentionally betrayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by word choice, i.e., I would vote against someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who employed a lot of Marxist jargon but who was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying exactly the same thing as someone who said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Western manufacturing managers should become less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addicted to assembly-line solutions.&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a topic for another day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They start from a position of faith or belief assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that as an axiom and reason from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I .....start from the axiom &quot;suffering is bad&quot; (that's me!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think the infant Lee Corbin came into the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; loaded with many &quot;axioms&quot; at all.  I also think that by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time you learnt what the word axiom meant your thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have developed way past the point where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have thought suffering is bad in every case. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think there is an *actual* as opposed to a theoretical or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophical state in which you do, or ever did, &quot;*start*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the axiom 'suffering is bad'&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your remarks about the infant Lee Corbin are pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessary.  OF COURSE one does not *start* in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way you describe.  Not even in geometry!!  You could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to read what is written a little more charitably?  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>No offence was meant. I apologise if I was insensitive.
<br>
<p>I adopted you as an example because you put yourself 
<br>
forward. I also saw the comment as off the main point so I 
<br>
didn't address it in depth. (Actually how infants learn I am
<br>
quite interested in).
<br>
<p>In a way though, even now, you are making my point for
<br>
me. That is that we need to be careful of the words we 
<br>
use in political discourse (like belief, &quot;human life&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;human being&quot;) and not rely too much on charitable 
<br>
interpretations. In a political world where transhumanists are
<br>
the ones wanting to make big changes quickly the burden
<br>
remains on us to make our case. We can't expect charity,
<br>
or that either our opponents or &quot;undecided&quot; listeners (voters)
<br>
to any debates will go to a lot of trouble to find the meaning
<br>
in words we use if we use ambiguous ones. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In what respect are you *with me*?  What do you take to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my main contention in this thread (that you are with me on)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I think that you were criticizing those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;start&quot; from a position of faith or belief in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifying their conclusions, as you wrote above.
</em><br>
<p>No. I'm cautioning extropians, transhumanists, free thinkers and
<br>
anyone who I think shares my goals (pretty much the ExI
<br>
Principles and wants to actually see them realized in the 
<br>
political world), to be aware that whenever *we* use the 
<br>
word 'belief' *we* are affirming the validity of that meme
<br>
which competes head to head with the meme of &quot;reason&quot; to
<br>
anyone who happens to be listening. Affirming that meme, by
<br>
using it, when *we* could quite easily find more precise 
<br>
alternatives to convey *our* actual meaning is not in our interest.
<br>
Indeed *we* are propagating the very meme that our opponents
<br>
so often invoke to our detriment when they *do* abdicate reason. 
<br>
<p>Now this is possibly a subtle point. And it is possibly wrong.
<br>
But I happen to think it is right at the moment and if I am right 
<br>
it is something that we can easily action.  (Alternatively if I am
<br>
wrong the same &quot;action&quot; will be harmless). That is we can easily
<br>
choose to use, and propagate by example, better memes than
<br>
the meme of &quot;belief&quot;. It will also be easier for us to point out
<br>
to observers (voters) where our opponents are using the word
<br>
belief in a completely unwholesome way if we haven't muddied
<br>
up the discourse by using it in a different (but perhaps not 
<br>
noticeable different to the observer/voter) way ourselves.
<br>
<p>I've proposed as a practical step that we replace the word
<br>
belief with alternatives of the same meaning in the ExI 
<br>
Principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But by your use of the word &quot;axiom&quot; I also inferred,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps incorrectly, that you also had a problem, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do, with those who would try to rigorously deduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from some small set of principles everything they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe---sorry---everything that they endorse.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not your &quot;main contention&quot;, of course.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not completely sure I am clear what you are saying
<br>
here and I don't want to speculate. Perhaps in another
<br>
thread.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My confession of &quot;suffering is bad&quot; as being sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axiomatic is only that this is a meme up against which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my thoughts frequently bump.  It's sort of a &quot;hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle&quot;.  But I've always had better sense than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to begin a Euclidean program on it!
</em><br>
<p>I reckon a Lee Corbin clone would possibly give you
<br>
a hard time over the phrase &quot;sort of axiomatic&quot;.  But I 
<br>
won't (well not much). I need to pick my battles as if 
<br>
I don't actually have an infinite amount of time or
<br>
resources.
