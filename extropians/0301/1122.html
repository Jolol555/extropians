<p>
I did make a mistake in my figure: 6,000 members in a proportionally
<br>
representative house of a world body would mean each seat
<br>
reoresents 1/60th of a percent. Sorry
<br>

<p>Mike Lorrey's comments:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems you don't understand the American system. Weakening the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executive would only retard the checks and balances of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, leading to a judiciary that is held hostage to majoritarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyranny in the legislature.
</em><br>
<p>I'm in favour of a weak executive head, a moderate judiciary and a strong
<br>
representative body. This is better for a postmortal situation. Countries
<br>
where the executive and legislature are more mixed, like Australia, I find
<br>
less democratic. They can be more autocratic, which is why you often
<br>
get Prime Ministers remaining in power for long periods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Executive power will crop up naturally. If it is not the President,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it will be the Speaker of the House or the Senate Majority Leader.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People will always look for one person to be ultimately responsible.
</em><br>
<p>I thin postmortals will be more independent minded and empowered.
<br>
psychologically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So: no property rights, no rights of free transit (which are different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from immigration rights) with internal passports much like the old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviet Union.
</em><br>
<p>I'm in favour of free movement anywhere. But you're right, the issue of
<br>
property rights is crucial. Currently you can own property and exclude
<br>
others from it. Fair enough. In a postmortal world we have to re-examine
<br>
the issue of property rights since we then exist in the post-Assembler
<br>
world.
<br>
What form this re-examination should take should be up for debate.
<br>
<p>I thought an ancillary area-based representative house of 6 million, with
<br>
areas
<br>
of 1,000 persons each, would make for some form of strong local input where
<br>
people
<br>
could have a real impact on their environment by consensus. I guess one
<br>
modification of this that might be more postmortal and alien to our way of
<br>
thinking would be to allow for &quot;areas&quot; to be fluid and move. Thus all the
<br>
lesbian separatists could congregate together physically in clusters of a
<br>
thousand, pushing (?) or negotiating other smaller areas to the side.
<br>
<p>Alternatively you could retain a non-European Western (US, Canada,
<br>
Australia)
<br>
notion of an osmotic nuclear family system of land ownership in urban areas
<br>
and corporate ownership of country estates, as currently exists in those
<br>
countries. However, &quot;urban&quot; in its fixed sense loses its meaning in the
<br>
post-Assembler
<br>
world, where cities and houses are capable of moving fluidly, to the extent
<br>
of
<br>
houes walking around on spiderlike stilts. And &quot;corporate&quot; loses its present
<br>
bases
<br>
of capital management and becomes more based on voluntary associative
<br>
groupings.
<br>
<p>It should be very interesting to see what happens.
<br>
<p>I am not particularly in favour of anything relating to the Soviet Union,
<br>
since
<br>
it was undemocratic and genocidal and besides which my mother and her
<br>
family lost all their property to Stalin and were war refugees and
<br>
onlyavoided
<br>
execution by chance. I wasn't thinking so much of area passes as the ability
<br>
of a group
<br>
of 1,000 people to unaminously freeze their property &quot;rights&quot; in a coherent
<br>
block
<br>
(thus excluding incomers) for example.
<br>
<p>While there may well still be &quot;parks&quot; and &quot;farms&quot; (to some extent) I doubt
<br>
the notion
<br>
of private country estates will last long in a postmortal context. People
<br>
really gung ho
<br>
about such things will probably go to other systems. Of course, there are 40
<br>
Earths
<br>
worth of material in the Oort cloud and Mars has water and Venus will be
<br>
easily
<br>
terraformed (indeed the whole solar system becomes putty over millenia even
<br>
without nanotech as we all know)... But given the numbers, these issues
<br>
arise even
<br>
within virtuality and computronium substrates, within this Solar system, on
<br>
a scale
<br>
of millions of years. If you don't leave the Solar system, under our current
<br>
understanding
<br>
if you are postmortal you are going to have to have wide breaks between
<br>
traditional
<br>
children.
<br>
<p>[Other factors may interfere with the above projections of course. Perhaps
<br>
there will be
<br>
some overwhelming developement, like teleportals/traversable wormholes or
<br>
multiverse
<br>
gates or TARDIS-like effects. Who can say, as yet...]
