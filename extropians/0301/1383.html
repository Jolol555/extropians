<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Machiavelli%20(Was:%20Iraq)">asa@nada.kth.se</a> writes: Machiavelli argued that a republic would be 
<br>
strengthened by the conflicts generated through open political participation 
<br>
and debate.  See the direct influence on liberal and dynamist thinking? 
<br>
<p>Yes, John Taylor Gatto wrote a book about the American school system called 
<br>
Dumbing Us Down.  The book is actually a collection of essays or speeches 
<br>
that he had given.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last section of the book he argues that one of the strengths of 
<br>
America in her development stages was that the Puritans of New England set up 
<br>
a dialectic in the way they organized their churches and towns.  They made 
<br>
some horrible mistakes but were steadily &quot;strengthened by the conflicts 
<br>
generated through open political participation and debate.&quot;  I quoted you 
<br>
obviously but if you would, for Gatto's purposes, extend the word political 
<br>
to include the religious sphere also.  As each small town was independent of 
<br>
the others at the town level, and as exit as well as entry was open, the good 
<br>
ones gained strength while the weak ones waned.  This provided the necessary 
<br>
feed back mechanism.  As a result the section of our country that gave us the 
<br>
Salem Witch Trials is now considered by many to be the most liberal section 
<br>
of our country.  And it was all done without experts, or outside pressure.
