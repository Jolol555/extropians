Samantha asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Is the point lost on you that at one time some powerful nations 
<br>
and groups said similar things about the Jewish people?  It is a 
<br>
very dark road that you are contemplating.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yah! But the Jews were and are tiny compared to a billion Muslims, and a 
<br>
large fraction of Jews never felt so threatend by democracy, that they became 
<br>
kamikazi attackers (9-11). As Bernard Lewis aptly stated: &quot;The Wahabbis as if 
<br>
the American KKK inherited oil fields.  Powerful nations (Europeans) still 
<br>
hate Jews but let the North Africans (as in France) carry out the 
<br>
violence-all they while pretending to &quot;deplore&quot; it. Laughable ;-)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;This is utterly ridiculous.  You claim those who do not want 
<br>
this very questionable war, much less your even broader 
<br>
conception of it are thereby &quot;Leftists&quot; (whatever the hell that 
<br>
his in your mind) or &quot;Pro-Nazi&quot;?  Do you honestly believe any 
<br>
sane person will accept such an argument?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, sanity seems never to be an issue as far as winning arguments go. But, 
<br>
yes, the neonazi National Alliance party in Cleveland, and their involvement 
<br>
with David Duke, who just completed a speaking tour in Kuwait, Abu Dabai, 
<br>
Bahrain etc.; before he was sentenced to prison for embezzling. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;You are categorically opposed (apparently) to the existence of 
<br>
large number of others!  You are very hypocritical in this.  You 
<br>
wish to cast all of this in terms of those opposed to your 
<br>
existence and the existence of your people.  Consider for just a 
<br>
moment that this is not so.  At the very least admit the obvious 
<br>
fact that those that disagree with you are not out to 
<br>
exterminate you and your people even when and if you advocate 
<br>
the extermination of others.
<br>

<br>
<p>After meeting so many Muslims in Yahoo chat, I am, as the lawyers say, 
<br>
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, that, at least they know what they want. 
<br>
Chiefly, the destruction of my peeps, which they are quite ardent about; and 
<br>
the ruination of the USA, which they seem even more motivated toward.  I am 
<br>
emphatically not, trying to seek a moral highground, but merely realize that 
<br>
these fellows want a war of extermiation. Passivity is not my orientation, so 
<br>
basically I am in favor of destabling the Wahabbis, the Ayatollahs and the 
<br>
like. I see no other choice, knowing what I believe I know, rather then just 
<br>
what I feel.
