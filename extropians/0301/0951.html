<p>
Two things I am quite weary of:
<br>
<p>1. People pretending to be an authority on what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other people's (or nation's) motives are
<br>
2. Posters complaining that we should &quot;harmonize&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of argue---that we should try to &quot;work
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together&quot; instead of score points.
<br>
<p>On 1, is Australia &quot;scared&quot; of the terrorists?  Is the
<br>
U.S. so &quot;scared&quot; that it's lashing back out of fear?
<br>
This terminology leaves a great deal to be desired.
<br>
What Ron *meant* was, is Australia intimidated by the
<br>
terrorists?  What Damien *meant* was, is the U.S. so
<br>
insecure that it has to strike back at someone, anyone?
<br>
Speculation is fine (as Mike Lorrey was doing about
<br>
Saddam's motives), but outright claims are silly.
<br>
<p>Rudiger complains,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Ron writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hard currency and when the mushroom cloud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rises over New York City or we are dropping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like flies from bacteriological warfare you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; get to yell piously once
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you really believe that we want that to happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or at least don't care)?
</em><br>
<p>It's incorrect for anyone to believe that (most of) you
<br>
want that to happen or do not care.  
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am positive that Dubya's primary personal goal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to settle a score and right a mistake of his father.
</em><br>
<p>You shouldn't be so positive.  How d'yah know?  He's
<br>
probably had hundreds of hours of discussions about
<br>
this with everyone on his staff, including his father.
<br>
Who knows what strategies are really being cooked up?
<br>
One could just as well say that one is positive that
<br>
it's all about oil, or all about non-proliferation,
<br>
or all about the 2004 election, or all about global
<br>
prestige.  We cannot know.
<br>
<p>On (2), above, Brett writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Lomborg debate provides just one example of where a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice was made to frame the discourse in terms of &quot;point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scoring over the opponent&quot; rather than, framing it in terms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;seeking a deeper understanding&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This choice, either to pursue &quot;point scoring&quot; or to pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;deeper understanding&quot; seems available to each of us each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  time we post.
</em><br>
<p>I wish I had a dollar for every time on this forum this
<br>
useless sentiment has been expressed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet it seems that there are STRUCTURAL aspects of a list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as this, that make it hard for people to keep in mind, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both that they HAVE this choice and that there are REAL 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences in how the choice is exercised 
</em><br>
<p>Do you really think that it would be any different in person?
<br>
Consider the exchange between Anders and Mike:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Anders wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; One prerequisite for having a constructive discussion about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; powerful topic is to be able to handle it on a high level of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; abstraction. When you know enough about a topic you can start to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; look at it from different sides. You can be abstract enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it so that you become dispassionate. 
</em><br>
<p>Mike replied
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the contrary, the more you know about a topic, when that topic turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Objective Truth, the more likely you are to be very passionate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the side which you are able to objectively, quantitatively, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualitatively determine is in the right. The opposition begins, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more, to look not just wrong, but foolish, naive, stubbornly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obstinate in their willful ignorance, and willing to believe anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that agrees with their prejudices.
</em><br>
<p>It's quite clear that the more someone learns about an 
<br>
issue, the less affected is his or her basic personality
<br>
disposition!  Those who start by being quite opinionated
<br>
remain that way, and those who tend to reserve judgment,
<br>
have &quot;working hypotheses&quot;, be indecisive, and so on, tend
<br>
to remain their way.
<br>
<p>And neither speaker here is distinguishing between ordinary
<br>
discussions of near-fact, and discussions laced with
<br>
ideology.  It is *extremely* difficult not to have a
<br>
somewhat biased perspective on the latter issues, and
<br>
only a fool has such prejudices about matters of fact!
<br>
<p>I agree with *all* of these further observations of Brett's:
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, RUDENESS, perceived or actual, intended or not, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enkindles a strong desire to respond that may not be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional, but may have some intellectual basis - in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle of &quot;tit for tat&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, quite naturally, people perceive and respond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negatively not just to BLATANT personal attacks but also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the subtler varieties. Ad hominem, or at least the essence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it, can be packaged into sophisticated forms. The use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insinuation and innuendo; selective excerpting; misleading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paraphrasing; even in the formulation of questions that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structured not to elicit discussion or serious consideration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that are leading and that invite the other to impale or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensnare themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When this occurs, I think it is a shame.  I feel fairly certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that NONE of the frequent posters to this list are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ACTUALLY as jaded, closed or cynical as some of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postings could be taken to suggest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ridicule CAN be an effective tools in SOME forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate, but its use invites an IN-kind response and soon, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is difficult for either party to change tack and for genuinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open questions to be asked. Passions inflamed are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily dowsed. Subtle slights and put-downs are remembered. 
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; It seems an original or initiating post, however carefully prepared,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to try and seek deeper understanding of an issue can be used as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launching pad by any would-be debater. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The opportunity to selectively excerpt affords a ready means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of changing the frame of reference to that which is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suitable to the practice-debater's knowledge base. They need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only select any detail, however incidental to the original thrust 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and reset the frame of reference to grounds more convenient to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the development and display of their debating skill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet, I do not think there is ANYONE who frequently posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this list who could neatly or fairly be categorised as ONLY  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in practicing their debating skills, or as only interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in pursuing and fostering deeper understanding. Indeed, the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches can be adopted at different times by the same person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and imo, sometimes, even by the same person at different points in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one post.
