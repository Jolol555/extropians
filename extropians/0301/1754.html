<em>&gt; Anyhow, about the price of oil, one big factor in price is taxes. No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suprise there. However I suggest that the relationship might be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little different than one might first assume. Huh? Surely if you tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil, the price goes up. Perhaps, perhaps not. Here is my reasoning:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.   Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise. iii.  Alternatives to oil based products appear a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      cheaper. I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      instead of driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iv.  Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; v.   Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vi.  To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, assume for a minute that the increased tax revenues taken in by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxing the oil are used to displace some other tax burden (yes, yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an unlikely scenario). Then:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a.   The nation sees no net change in the tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b.   The nation sees a net decrease in the price of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c.   The oil producing country has a little less income from oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The net effect: a reduction in the price of oil from the nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective. I.e. by taxing crude oil an oil importing country can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trim some of the windfall profits from the oil exporting country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>### The net effect would be a reduction in economic efficiency - instead of
<br>
using cheap oil, and having more resources left for e.g. science, or
<br>
leisure, the economy (meaning every company and every individual) would
<br>
spend resources (time, energy, scientific effort) to reduce energy
<br>
consumption (forgoing some pleasures, like having a well-lit home, or a warm
<br>
bedroom), or produce more costly energy. At the same time, the oil-producing
<br>
country would have less money to spend on products made by the oil user,
<br>
reducing trade, and reducing economic activity in both countries. A clear
<br>
loss for all parties.
<br>
<p>You could use the same reasoning regarding e.g. taxes on bananas. Since
<br>
bananas can be produced only in countries with the right climate, they are a
<br>
windfall, like oil, with growing of bananas being like pumping of oil, a
<br>
mere exploitation of a natural resource. I hope you can see the analogy. One
<br>
might want to cut the windfall profits and spur domestic fruit production by
<br>
taxing bananas - but why do it? Trade, whether in bananas, oil, manufactured
<br>
goods, or &quot;natural products&quot;, is good. No need to kill the goose laying
<br>
golden eggs.
<br>
<p>Say no to commodity taxes!
