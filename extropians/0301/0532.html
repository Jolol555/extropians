<br>
<p><em>&gt; So there is a cognitive difference in *which* disapprovals are produced, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the epistemological stance is the same?  (I ask because I had thought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were arguing that BAD was epistemologically ill-founded but &quot;none of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my business&quot; was not.)
</em><br>
<p>Oh, sorry.  No, I don't consider &quot;BAD&quot; to be ill-founded
<br>
epistemologically; almost always, the speaker means that
<br>
he disapproves, or that something is unworkable (i.e. leads
<br>
to that which both he and his listener disapprove).  A 
<br>
sign that people are getting their epistemology wrong
<br>
is when they use the word &quot;Wrong&quot; and you can hear the
<br>
capital letter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There are millions of examples where something is none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of my business, and interference inconceivable, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are nonetheless very BAD in my opinion.  Abortion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infanticide are two such examples, but even such mundane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cases as adultery and lying come to mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So to you adultery is BAD, second-party intervention to stop adultery is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WORSE, and a police officer arresting someone who threatens an adulterer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a pistol is GOOD?
</em><br>
<p>Nice thought provoking question!  I'm pretty sure that rating
<br>
these items in order depends on the culture at hand, e.g., between
<br>
your first two, is this in a small community that has outlawed
<br>
it, or is it in a large nation where the &quot;one size fits all&quot;
<br>
mentality has succeeded in making something illegal that 
<br>
perhaps shouldn't be?  But you look to be understanding me
<br>
quite skillfully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's very easy in most cases to determine whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not something is my affair.  It's harder when as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legislator---or as a citizen giving advice to legislators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or propping up memes I favor---to try to draw the correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bounds of modularity.  For some purposes, the apparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modular unit is the family; sometimes it's &quot;woman with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; child&quot; (a sort of family).  At other times the efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way to draw boundaries between modules is at the community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level, e.g., whose business is it if some small town 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somewhere wishes to outlaw prostitution?  Only the citizens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; say I.  (I hope that at this point no one says, &quot;Oh yeah?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What if they decide to suspend habeas corpus or deny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religious freedom?&quot;)   &lt;lecture on success of nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supporting constitutional rights suppressed for brevity&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hm... I think you need to separate out your supergoals from your subgoals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.  That's one of *my* least favorite epistemological confusions.
</em><br>
<p>I appreciate the challenge.  What about these, in decreasing
<br>
order of importance?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;1.  Maximal run time and benefits for sentients in spacetime.
<br>
&nbsp;2.  Rapid expansion of human society (including a Singularity).
<br>
&nbsp;3.  Unleashing of and maximization of capitalism world-wide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(instead of its confinement to Western-type societies).
<br>
&nbsp;4.  Maximal protection of individual rights and protection of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private property, and undermining of anti-progress forces
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including Luddites and terrorists).
<br>
<p>but to try to incorporate the items about which you noticed
<br>
a super-goal/sub-goal confusion, maybe I should add
<br>
<p>&nbsp;M.  vertical integration and modularity to be determined
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foremost by economic considerations, and rights of pre-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existing citizens (at any current level of progress).
<br>
<p>I believe that this would be in support of both (3) and (4).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;N.  minimization of global rules which suppress experimentation,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g., all the ad hoc new rules that quickly occur to anyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when asked whether &quot;there oughta be a law&quot;.
<br>
<p>This---freedom---would apparently be in support of (3) and (4) too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now it so happens that slave-owning societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not competitive, but let's consider a more challenging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example to my (and maybe your) world-view.  In the 1950s, 1960s,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and 1970s, a lot of great economists, like Samuelson, believed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the Soviet economic model was more productive than Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capitalism.  In retrospect, this seems very foolish, but for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those of us alive then it appeared plausible.  The question then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could become---say if indeed the Soviet Union had truly begun to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supersede the West---might we not have to adopt some of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; totalitarian methods if we want to remain competitive?  The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could well have been &quot;yes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That depends on whether you'd rather keep the light alive in yourself for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as long as you can, even if it's doomed to eventually fade, rather than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blow it out yourself to retain the illusion of being in control.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if it's going to be blown out anyway, isn't it better
<br>
that it be done by the people with the preferable history?
<br>
Naturally, it's obvious that this could always be used as
<br>
a rationalization to be used by the usual sorts who get
<br>
government power to claim a *necessity*.  We are seeing 
<br>
exactly this effect played out in the Iraq/Ashcroft debate.
<br>
To what degree, and when, must a republic (as Samantha has
<br>
finally succeeded in convincing me to be the right term)
<br>
adopt extreme measures to defend itself?  Was Lincoln's
<br>
suspension of habeas corpus justified in the Civil War?
<br>
Was the internment of the Japanese and the round-up
<br>
of suspected German sympathizers, during WWII?  In the
<br>
latter case, I'd say yes, but I don't know enough about
<br>
the former.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But that just makes my point!  Non-functioning societies or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uncompetitive ones aren't admissible to the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So historically we are brought to this:  extreme regard for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; private property and individual legal rights works, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coincidentally provides the said entities of the time with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maximal benefit and prosperity.  But the challenging question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is about the future, which I know concerns you and should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concern all of us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, so we should have extreme regard for the individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal rights of babies?
</em><br>
<p>Why?  They don't play any economic role.  There is no evidence
<br>
to suggest that attention to their legal rights has ever made
<br>
a society more competitive, or has advanced the items (2), (3),
<br>
and (4) that you elicited from me.  No, we want to assist them
<br>
in obtaining protection from their murderous parents because
<br>
our heartstrings are plucked, and we want to force everyone
<br>
(e.g. Mormons) to do things our way, even at cost of breaking
<br>
down the modular boundaries of family or community.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Incidentally, I think that while parents having control of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children is often bad, having nonparents or governmental entities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfering is worse.  I don't say that it's none of my business; I say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that my goal of protecting the child is best served by protecting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child from governors, not protecting the child from parents.  It's not a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect solution, though.  I would - for example - look favorably on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who released software that children could use to bypass parental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions on Internet access; I couldn't be on the child's side if I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought the child was the parent's property.  My theory here is that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child has full sentient rights, that a parent who shares 1/2 the child's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA is statistically more likely to protect that child than a governor who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shares none of the child's DNA, and that the child, who shares 1.0 of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child's DNA, is the best decider of all...
</em><br>
<p>This all appears consistent, but do you have any discomfort
<br>
with the way that children are legally prevented from driving,
<br>
from alcohol, from voting, and from entering into contracts?  
<br>
<p>I would hardly want to pass laws that kept kids from getting
<br>
software (from other kids at school, for example), that enabled
<br>
them to circumvent their parents wishes!  Yet at the same time,
<br>
the citizen-parents ought to have the default legal right to
<br>
deny internet access in toto to their children.  I suppose that
<br>
I feel this way because of the greater experimentation, and the
<br>
less regimentation of society that ensues when you have freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Don't you feel lucky that there is such a clear distinction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans and other primates, and other mammals?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Erm... I do feel somewhat lucky, but I think perhaps for different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons.  My ethical system says that it might be a bad thing to create 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such halfways.  But I don't feel lucky because &quot;my ethical system would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break down if it confronted halfways&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I feel lucky too, because establishing legal rights
<br>
for citizens could have been greatly retarded historically
<br>
if there weren't such a clear dividing line.  (See discussion
<br>
of PETA below.)  But for fun let's suppose that the IQ bell
<br>
curve was a straight line, with the few humans at the extreme
<br>
right of the curve, and the vast mast of plankton on the extreme
<br>
left.  I say that then we would have much sooner had to come up
<br>
with a consistent value system that appreciated superiority.
<br>
(Yet observe how much social (read economic) progress has been
<br>
made by affording blacks exactly the same legal rights as Jews
<br>
and Asians.)
<br>
<p>But creating &quot;halfways&quot; at this point wouldn't be a bad thing, IMO.
<br>
As I like to emphasize, who's it hurting?  Not them.  They'd be
<br>
better off in the usual cases than not existing.  (I realize we
<br>
may disagree about that.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As much as PETA might want to award citizenship to numerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other classes of creatures, it's not practical.  So we allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans to own other animals (and children, up to a point).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not practical?  Only if your metric of moral fitness evaluates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only human fun, which is in fact the very issue being discussed.
</em><br>
<p>I still need to read your important essay on &quot;fun&quot;, but my
<br>
working hypothesis is that I would agree entirely with it.
<br>
I'm sure that it will eventually be shown that chipmunks
<br>
are more capable of receiving benefit---have a larger 
<br>
benefit capacitance, say---than spiders.  Likewise, humans
<br>
with well functioning nervous systems have more capacity
<br>
for fun or benefit than animals.
<br>
<p>Our civilization would be delivering much less total benefit
<br>
to sentients had legal rights been established for non-humans.
<br>
The Singularity, is, of course, the final demonstration that
<br>
this is true---when matter whatever its constitution gets
<br>
benefit.
