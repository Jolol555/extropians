</em><br>
<p>Mike/Lee I simply cannot accept this premise (sorry).
<br>
<p>You have to assume that (a) the U.S. (or Europe) would
<br>
act to pump-up-the volume with respect to Iraqi oil
<br>
production (and there is no useful knowledge with
<br>
respect to the degree they could do that given a
<br>
decade of decay in the production capabilities) and
<br>
that the (b) the Saudis (or other OPEC or even non-OPEC
<br>
members) would not act in a way to offset the production
<br>
increase that Iraq *might* be able to achieve.
<br>
<p>The price of oil is subject to a complex &quot;present value
<br>
analysis&quot; of both the countries producing it and the
<br>
consumers.  It comes down to a question of &quot;do I gain
<br>
more by pumping the oil or leaving it in the ground?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Yes, there are disruptions, e.g. Venezuela or perhaps
<br>
pipelines being blown up (or not built due to political
<br>
problems), etc.  But you are living in a fantasy world
<br>
if you think most oil producing nations are going to
<br>
pump oil at $10/bbl).  They *know* the supply will
<br>
eventually decline.  They are also in primarily state
<br>
run companies that are not subject to the quarterly
<br>
dictates of Wall Street.  So their focus is on &quot;how
<br>
do I preserve my job?&quot;.  And that is very dfferent
<br>
in each political situation.
<br>
<p>So I would suggest that if you think every oil minister
<br>
will continue to do exactly what they are doing now if
<br>
Iraq bumps its production from say 2M to 4M BBL (these
<br>
are hypothetical numbers which one would need to verify)
<br>
then you are living in fantasy land.
<br>
