<p>My evaluation to date is very subjective (based on my on &quot;personal&quot;
<br>
global experiences).  The NY Times article was quite revealing.  I'm
<br>
sure there are people on the list who could do a better job at developing
<br>
an evaluation matrix than I.  Things like Infant Mortality Rate (a measure
<br>
The Hunger Project uses) along with some of the measures used by organizations
<br>
like Amnesty International (e.g. freedom of the press) combined with some
<br>
more extropic measures (% of GDP invested in R&amp;D?).  There is probably a
<br>
PhD thesis in evaluating these from a historic perspective to determine
<br>
for which there is evidence that they drive the engines of development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To compliment this list and diagram, we could also illustrate what
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; affecting humanity.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.  That is why the China efforts in developing cloning
<br>
laboratories are interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would be an excellent reference guide and not just focused on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downward trending countries, but also upward movement.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we shouldn't focus only on the negative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks Robert.  Do you want to solicit folks to work on it?
</em><br>
<p>It isn't my focus, I just offer it up as something constructive
<br>
that people could easily work on.  We often seem to get involved
<br>
in long drawn out esoteric debates.  Having concrete criteria for
<br>
evaluating directions of subsets of humanity gives one a way to
<br>
focus attention (and potentially lobby for publicity for both
<br>
the good and the bad).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's work on it and get it up on our site!
</em><br>
<p>The ball is in your court.
<br>
