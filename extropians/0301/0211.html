Lee writes, to Eugen:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So which is it?  Do you think disabled persons with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hereditary defect should be allowed to procreate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To obtain clones (when it's perfected)?
</em><br>
<p>I would also like to hear Eugen's and other's ideas about this
<br>
difficult problem.  However I would phrase the question differently,
<br>
not in terms of what is &quot;allowed&quot;, but in terms of what is right
<br>
and wrong.  Specifically:
<br>
<p>&quot;If you were a disabled person with a hereditary defect, would you
<br>
attempt to procreate (supposing that embryo screening to eliminate the
<br>
defect were not possible)?  Would it be right for you to clone yourself
<br>
when it is perfected?&quot;
<br>
<p>In my experience we move too quickly from the question of what is right
<br>
to the question of what is allowed.  These are very difficult and complex
<br>
issues, but all too soon we are trying to decide the matter not only for
<br>
ourselves, but for our neighbors as well.  But if we are still struggling
<br>
with the issue in our own minds, how can we have the confidence to say
<br>
what the right answer is for someone else?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the rhetorical perspective, moving to questions of coercion hurts the
</em><br>
process of discussion.  People become defensive and accusatory.  Some are
<br>
afraid their rights will be taken away by force.  Others are worried
<br>
that they will be compelled to allow criminal injustice to go unanswered.
<br>
People adopt positions and defend them.  The memetic warfare escalates,
<br>
rhetorical bombs being hurled, no quarter given, innocent bystanders
<br>
repulsed.  Collateral damage to the list, to the principles of civil
<br>
discourse, is ignored as winning the memetic battle becomes the only goal.
<br>
<p>It's also rather pointless, since none of us is in a position to
<br>
enforce our beliefs anyway.  We are all out on the fringe, and it will
<br>
be a long time before our influence is enough to change the larger
<br>
political process that will end up deciding what is actually allowed.
<br>
No political position taken by a member of this list is a threat to
<br>
anyone here.  We have no dictators, no presidents, no members of the
<br>
national judiciary or legislature.
<br>
<p>I would encourage people to step back from the question of what should be
<br>
allowed and to try to focus the discourse on questions of what personal
<br>
actions we would choose in various circumstances.  Life is not easy,
<br>
there are many hard questions facing all of us.  I would like to see
<br>
us work together to try to explore the various arguments on all sides
<br>
of the issues.  We should try to respond constructively to each other,
<br>
rather than falling into the trap of constant vitriolic debate.
<br>
<p>Building up the positions and arguments given by others should happen as
<br>
often as tearing them down.  People should present arguments on both sides
<br>
of every issue!  This simple step would go a huge way towards orienting
<br>
our efforts towards problem solving and brainstorming rather than winning
<br>
debates.  Surely we are all intelligent enough to realize that there
<br>
are good arguments on both sides.  Why do so few of us present them?
<br>
I think it is symptomatic of the flawed process I describe above.
<br>
<p>I would encourage debaters to write a posting making the best arguments
<br>
they can for the position in some dispute which they think is weaker.  Do
<br>
it as a test of your intellectual integrity and argumentative abilities.
<br>
Don't undercut your posting by saying that you don't really believe it,
<br>
because that is your ideology riding you.  It is kicking in the spurs
<br>
and tightening the leash around your neck, afraid you might escape its
<br>
mastery.  Make the arguments be true and honest and consistent.  You don't
<br>
have any need to apologize for speaking the truth, even if you believe
<br>
that on balance there are opposing arguments that are more persuasive.
<br>
Anyone who participated in competitive debate in school knows that you have
<br>
to be able to argue both sides equally well.  It is a good exercise for
<br>
seeing issues clearly, uncontaminated by ego and ideology.
<br>
