It seems as though there is a lot of support onlist for the US going to war
<br>
to free enslaved people. The trouble is, no one can quite work out why Iraq
<br>
is the target of choice.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the US could best choose a target by having a referrendum (or
<br>
whatever equivalent its constitution prescribes). Get a list of maybe 20
<br>
countries (an Extended Axis of Evil!!) that, in the opinion of a commitee
<br>
(politicians, defense people, maybe a few celebs and a talk radio host)
<br>
could do with a severe whupping from the USA, and whose people would be
<br>
grateful forever and a day. It'd be a big event, you would have various
<br>
groups popup to defend country X or suggest countries Y and Z. You could
<br>
event have a mass debate (har har) with diplomats from each country putting
<br>
their position. 
<br>
<p>To be fair, you could probably slip in a choice on the ballot of &quot;No wars
<br>
please&quot;. But it'd be best to use a smaller and mostly illegible font, and
<br>
hide it down near the bottom of the list. You could probably get the
<br>
politicians and the talkback radio guy to rubbish it a bit, and imply that
<br>
people choosing it were hippy peacenik scum, or supporters of the entire
<br>
Extended Axis of Evil!
<br>
<p>Then, once the voting closed, and the results were in, there'd be no more
<br>
argument. War by the people's choice, the democratic way. 
<br>
<p>On reflection, I guess that's a really stupid way to choose a war. Best
<br>
leave it to the powers that be, they know best.
