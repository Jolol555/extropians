[Hal Finney, in a very good post]
<br>
&lt;But if we want to stick to naturalistic explanations,
<br>
another possibility is to suggest that all the universes
<br>
exist, each with its own set of parameters, and then life
<br>
will only evolve in those universes where that is possible.&gt;
<br>
<p>Found a lot of papers, about 'multiverses', Deutschean and not.

&lt;Anthropic principle can help us to understand many properties of our world.
<br>
However, for a long time this principle seemed too metaphysical and many
<br>
scientists were ashamed to use it in their research. I describe here a
<br>
justification of the weak anthropic principle in the context of inflationary
<br>
cosmology and suggest a possible way to justify the strong anthropic
<br>
principle using the concept of the multiverse.&gt;

Extended version of a contribution to the MicroCosmos -
<br>
MacroCosmos conference in Aachen, Germany, September 2-5 1998; finished in
<br>
late 1998 and published in the conference proceedings (this http URL)
<br>
&lt;For Lee Smolin, our universe is only one in a much larger cosmos (the
<br>
Multiverse) - a member of a growing community of universes, each one being
<br>
born in a bounce following the formation of a black hole. In the course of
<br>
this, the values of the free parameters of the physical laws are reprocessed
<br>
and slightly changed. This leads to an evolutionary picture of the
<br>
Multiverse, where universes with more black holes have more descendants.
<br>
Smolin concludes, that due to this kind of Cosmological Natural Selection
<br>
our own universe is the way it is. The hospitality for life of our universe
<br>
is seen as an offshot of this self-organized process. - This paper outlines
<br>
Smolin's hypothesis, its strength, weakness and limits, its relationship to
<br>
the anthropic principle and evolutionary biology, and comments on the
<br>
hypothesis from different points of view: physics, biology, philosophy of
<br>
science, philosophy of nature, and metaphysics. Some of the main points are:
<br>
(1) There is no necessary connection between black holes and life. In
<br>
principle, life and Cosmological Natural Selection could be independent of
<br>
each other. Smolin might explain the so-called fine-tuning of physical
<br>
constants, but life remains an epiphenomenon. (2) The Darwinian analogy is
<br>
an inadequate model transfer. The fitness of Smolin's universes is not
<br>
constrained by its environment, but by only one internal factor: the numbers
<br>
of black holes. Furthermore, although Smolin's universes have different
<br>
reproduction rates, they are not competing against each other. (3) Smolin's
<br>
central claim cannot be falsified.&gt;

&lt;The Multiverse is collection of parallel universes. In this article a
<br>
formal
<br>
theory and a topos-theoretic models of the multiverse are given. For this
<br>
the Lawvere-Kock Synthetic Differential Geometry and topos models for smooth
<br>
infinitesimal analysis are used. Physical properties of multi-variant and
<br>
many-dimensional parallel universes are discussed. The source of
<br>
multiplicity of physical objects is set of physical constants.&gt;

&lt;The Deutsch multiverse is collection of parallel universes. In this article
<br>
a formal theory and a topos-theoretic model of the Deutsch multiverse are
<br>
given. For this the Lawvere-Kock Synthetic Differential Geometry and topos
<br>
models for smooth infinitesimal analysis are used. Physical properties of
<br>
multi-variant and many-dimensional parallel universes are discussed. Quantum
<br>
fluctuations of universe geometry are considered. Photon ghosts in parallel
<br>
universes are found.&gt;
<br>
<p>Somedody at <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~xplorerx3/Multiverse.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~xplorerx3/Multiverse.htm</a>
<br>
says that &quot;According to Vedic Cosmology, there are countless universes,
<br>
which are clustered together like foam on the surface of the Causal Ocean.
<br>
The universes are separated from each other by the shell that envelopes
<br>
each universe. Although the universes are clustered together, interactions
<br>
between the universes are impossible. Each universe is completely protected
<br>
by an enormous shell. Thus, each universe has a boundary. The universe is
<br>
ball shaped and surrounded by an eight-fold shell. This shell is composed
<br>
of primeval material elements in their most subtle manifestation.
<br>
The shell consists of eight spherical layers in which each successive
<br>
material element is manifested and stored. If we penetrate the universal
<br>
shell consisting of these eight spherical layers, we will enter the
<br>
universal globe and find a hollow region containing all the inhabited
<br>
planets&quot;.
<br>
<p>Wikipedia at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse</a>
<br>
says that &quot;A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged
<br>
within the 11-dimensional extension of string theory known as M-theory.
<br>
In M-theory our universe and others are created by collisions between
<br>
membranes in an 11-dimensional space. Unlike the universes in the quantum
<br>
multiverse, these universes can have completely different laws of physics
<br>
- anything may be possible&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anything may be possible? I do not know but a multiverse exhibition
<br>
is already here <a href="http://computerart.org/g0016.html">http://computerart.org/g0016.html</a> .

<p>A dialogue at <a href="http://www.lns.cornell.edu/spr/2000-09/msg0027976.html">http://www.lns.cornell.edu/spr/2000-09/msg0027976.html</a>
<br>
shows that the multiverse issue can be ... dangerous :-)
<br>
<p>Mr.1 - Worlds are eternal, as the Heisenberg picture shows.
<br>
<p>Mr.2 - I don't follow you here? Do you mean a world is a state,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which doesn't change with time?
<br>
<p>Mr.1 - The threading is messed up, and I can't figure out why I said that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of the universe is, of course, eternal in the H picture,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I don't remember what I was getting at by mentioning that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you find what it was I was replying to?
