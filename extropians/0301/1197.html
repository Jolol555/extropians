Dan L writes to me, in at least two-ply thinking
<br>
[my comments are indicated &gt;[] thus):
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>People want definitive answers to complex things [....] Seems to me with
<br>
foreign policy that the only real answer to anything is IF/THEN.
<br>
<p><p>If we attack Iraq, then:
<br>
<p>* there's the Friedmanian possibility that the shackles of Arab dictators
<br>
will be loosened, creating tolerance in the region;
<br>
* Oil will get expensive, then cheap
<br>
* We will be managers of an empire of sorts. (A superpower is an empire)
<br>
* We will NOT be thanked, whatever the outcome
<br>
* McDonalds will introduce Lamburgers
<br>
<p>If we don't attack Iraq, then:
<br>
<p>* The credibility of the US on the global stage will be entirely diminished;
<br>
* Saddam will maybe be good and only gas his own;
<br>
* Saddam will maybe be bad and gas our own;
<br>
* The world will breathe a sigh of relief. Erroneously.
<br>
<p><p>BTW, I think the Bushies do NOT want a smoking gun to be found in Iraq.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;[Interjection from MMB: Not by the inspectors, oh hell no! For precisely the
</em><br>
reasons you suggest below...]
<br>
<p>If they found a battery of nuke missiles, for example, that would be the
<br>
smoking gun. But the Bushies would have a new problem, the UN saying &quot;Well,
<br>
America, you were sure right about that WMD thing. So now we've found them.
<br>
Just in time. Our mistake. And of course, now that we have found the threat
<br>
of mass destruction and removed it, no need to invade.&quot;
<br>
<p><em> &gt;[Interjection from MMB: And if stuff is found post-US-assault, then the
</em><br>
filthy Zionist-run Sons of Satan planted it there, just the way they staged
<br>
the WTC attacks!]
<br>
<p>You know what...? I think the UN sucks. If they manage to cow us into
<br>
not invading, then so be it. Our credibility will be nil. Things will
<br>
fester, the problem will revisit us worse than ever, at a later date.
<br>
And then UN credibility will be nil.
<br>
<p>Bloody bore being the world leader.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt;[Ayup. It's chess times poker, with blood on all the cards, and light too
</em><br>
dim to see what-all chips you're betting with.
<br>
<p>MMBDamned and double damned]
