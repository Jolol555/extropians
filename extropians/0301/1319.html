It was said (TheSpike) spaeketh:
<br>
&lt;&lt;As many posters here have also noted, the fact that
<br>
the Iraqi regime is vile, murderous and a possible threat to its vile and
<br>
murderous neighbors in no wise distinguishes it from many other nations
<br>
currently clients of the USA (many of them, in fact, the vile and murderous
<br>
neighbors of Iraq).
<br>
Just desserts? For what crime touching directly on the US?
<br>
Alice in Wonderland&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Look, you have to begin somewhere. Leading the US military into a general 
<br>
conquest of the region actually is imperialism and not rhetorical flourish, 
<br>
by our leftist friends.
<br>
Pull out Saddam, and your pressure the Saudis (oil!) it cuts into their 
<br>
profit margin. Not as much cash to fund jihadis in the quiet of the evening, 
<br>
as a recent Saudi princess was caught doing, and less cash for suicide 
<br>
bombers, despite telethons for this purpose. Iran and its mullahs get 
<br>
pressured, It secures their (mullahs) for a while--the Yankee enemy next 
<br>
door! But it also serves to undermine the ayatollahs. Curse those sickening 
<br>
Kaffir broadcasts from Zionist Occupied Iraq, anyway! Look how the young 
<br>
people are behaving! 
<br>
<p>Iraq being bashed will have a beneficial multiplier effect. Ultimately the 
<br>
Iraqi people will benefit because all that palace building cash will be 
<br>
diverted to such luxury items as food, medicine, small business loans, etc.
<br>
<p>Alice in Wonderland, indeed
<br>
<p>Sincerely, the White Rabbit
