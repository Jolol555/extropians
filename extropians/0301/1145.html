<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Claim: formal logic played no part in the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Western science.  (Einstein was mistaken.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Einstein was speaking pragmatically. I would paraphrase his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement thusly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Scientific progress has depended upon two things: 1) formal logic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially mathematics, and 2) the philosophy of empiricism.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'd still take out the word &quot;formal&quot;.  My whole point
<br>
was that formal logic is merely an abstract codification of
<br>
logic.  Most logical activity (by someone building a steam-
<br>
engine, for example, takes place with no formal component at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Empiricism without mathematical formalism leads to nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical; empirical data must be used ultimately to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of mathematically precise predictions about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it seems to me that while your statement is true
<br>
in a majority of cases, there are far too many exceptions
<br>
for such a generality.  Consider Darwin's work alone:
<br>
exceedingly empirical, but so far as I know, entirely
<br>
without mathematics.  And he's considered by many, including
<br>
me, to be the greatest scientist of all time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Likewise, formal logic (pure math) is useless until it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied to real world problems.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The science of astronomy is a good example.  The development of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science has depended on the formal logic of Euclid (one cannot so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as build a simple telescope without an understanding of geometry),
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the way that it happened in the west.  Now, I don't
<br>
know enough about Islamic glass-making to say for sure, but it's
<br>
entirely credible that those particular Moslem experimenters did
<br>
not employ mathematics in their efforts.  It's easy for me to
<br>
imagine that practiced opticians could have developed telescopes,
<br>
though certainly not of the quality achieved by 1800 A.D.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the discoveries of astronomy have depended also on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy of empiricism (the scientific method).
</em><br>
<p>Without a doubt.
