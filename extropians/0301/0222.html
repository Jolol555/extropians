<em>&gt; &gt;Whilst I understand Natasha concern, I am not sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can agree with Hubert's &quot;assessment&quot; this time. It may well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be that certain memes can serve as bad examples and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities to differentiate ourselves in the eyes of newbies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and some not so newbies) I think this group *is* vital and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  energetic enough, and also that if it is to grow still more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective in propagating its memes then it will need to do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  under environmental conditions that will not always be sweet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sunshine and soft gentle rain.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ___________
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you may have taken this post too seriously, Brett.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe. I do that sometimes : ). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I prefer to lay cards on the table, I also foster any bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of wisdom from life experience to steer clear of situations that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suck energy. There are far better ways of driving the meme 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engine than to focus on negative commentary.  Any smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  book on business and psychological strategy will concer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10% focus on the problem and 90% focus on the solution has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better chance of bringing about success.
</em><br>
<p>On the first two quick reads of this I strongly agreed. But it occurs
<br>
that not everything that seems to be negative commentary to one is
<br>
necessarily that.  Sometimes constructive criticism can be perceived
<br>
as negative commentary I think. I've studied some psychology at uni
<br>
and retain an interest in it. I guess I am wary that homo sapiens as a
<br>
class (and including myself as an instance of the class) frequently filter
<br>
new data through our existing stereotypes and sometimes, quite
<br>
unconsciously, we reject what doesn't seem to fit. From this view I 
<br>
draw the conclusion that the feedback of others may be a useful way
<br>
for me to gain insight into my own biases. Similarly, others, honestly
<br>
and criticially open to new sources of information and new ways of
<br>
seeing, but still constrained somewhat by the standard psych filters,
<br>
can benefit from my perspective. 
<br>
<p>Sometimes it is our critics that can give us valuable information
<br>
about where our messages are failing to get through or are being
<br>
misunderstood.
<br>
<p>My current approach to things is probably a bit hyper-political
<br>
because of what I've been doing over much of the last year as
<br>
a lobbyist working with pro-biotech and stem cell industry groups
<br>
and patient advocacy groups to try and get the best possible
<br>
legislative environment in Australia for stem cell research. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case, a successful outcome for categorizing trans-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanists inappropriately would be to work harder positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  memes that provoke intelligent and compassionate acts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hello Pro-Act.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry I'm not familiar with Pro-Act.  I think the talking about
<br>
positive things and positive developments is a great way to
<br>
counterbalance the negative aspects that need to be handled
<br>
sometimes. I've been thinking its a bit of a pity that the subject
<br>
line atop this post has been getting as much of the bandwidth as
<br>
it has. It neither reflects the interests of most of the people on the
<br>
list or indeed what is actually within most of the posts. But just this
<br>
morning Australian time, I looked at a number of other threads 
<br>
posted by list members and thought this stuff is great. The quality
<br>
of the content is very high. This is NOT a group in danger of being
<br>
swamped by negativity in my view. And it is a group able to take
<br>
criticism critically and benefit from it. The halcyon days haven't
<br>
passed for the ExI list. These are the halcyon days. May they
<br>
continue : ) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Frankly, it has hardly been tested yet in comparison with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what may be thrown at it by those seeing extropic memes as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat and really going after it.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ____________
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropic memes are not a threat to anyone who is able to accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. Even the most conservative of people are aware that life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is full of change.
</em><br>
<p>Yes but awareness is not acceptance. People imo fear change
<br>
especially when they feel they can't be a part in shaping or directing
<br>
it. I think most of the population of the planet feel like that a lot of 
<br>
the time. Extropians imo and transhumanists and free thinkers
<br>
generally are likely to have more of an &quot;internal locus of control&quot;
<br>
they are likely to perceive that they can make significant changes to
<br>
the world they/we live in.  And they are likely to be right. Many 
<br>
people have more of an &quot;external locus of control&quot;. They feel that
<br>
change is more something that happens to them. The preception
<br>
is self-fulfilling so they too are likely to be right. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Certainly there was no threat to ExI from Lyle Burkhead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the link I saw. He didn't even associate himself with extropians.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ___________
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.  He associated himself with trashumanism.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Still, it is certainly not my list, and others have invested much in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setting it up and maintaining it. I consider myself to be an extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as I understand it) and I will help defend the fort if it needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defending so long as what is inside remains worth defending. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly see no immediate danger of that not being the case.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; __________
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you consider the comment of one person, me, as a given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the list?
</em><br>
<p>I don't. Nor do I think you do. Sorry if that's the impression I gave.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because I prefer not to discuss one person's ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I'd rather focus on other things should not warrant any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern on your part.
</em><br>
<p>In my experience many people and groups find it exceptionally
<br>
difficult to really hear criticism and therefor to benefit from it. 
<br>
<p>It really is hard work to start organisations and promote lists and
<br>
to actually be a positive political force for positive change. The folk
<br>
that do it, do it because they love it, they find reward in it. And that
<br>
is good (I'm talking generally here not about ExI). But often, and I
<br>
have had quite a bit of experience with this, the folk that do most
<br>
of the work of maintaining a vehicle or a brand or a forum become
<br>
protective of what they have built (again still quite normal, natural
<br>
and healthy). But then sometimes the protectiveness goes to far
<br>
they censor too much. They fear too much that their much loved
<br>
vehicle and all their work will be wasted if others, especially the
<br>
&quot;wrong sort&quot; of others, start to use it as a personal platform, and
<br>
&nbsp;the others are not courteous or respectful, or they may even be
<br>
opportunistic, stupid, blatantly self-serving and exploitative. In my
<br>
experience (and drawing also on my interest in psychology and
<br>
politics) good organisations, frequently do lose the plot at some 
<br>
stage, they lose some of their vitality, perhaps morphing into too
<br>
much a platform for just one or two peoples views. They start to
<br>
go into a downward spiral, that is very hard to check as the very
<br>
process of checking can itself foster problems. I think some 
<br>
others recognize this general organisational phenomenon too. 
<br>
<p>Now I *am* switching over to talking about ExI, the list and my
<br>
perception of your role in it. 
<br>
<p>I may have projected too much protectiveness onto you as 
<br>
one who I perceived to be strongly invested in the establishment
<br>
and supporting of ExI and this excellent list. I may have mistakenly
<br>
thought that you were more anxious and concerned about the 
<br>
vitality of ExI and this list than you are. If so I am both sorry
<br>
and pleased. Sorry if I misprojected and pleased if my concern
<br>
was misplaced. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;If any of the extropian committee (especially) ever sends me a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please desist or consider post offlist I *will* heed it. But I strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; urge against shooting messengers, it is a very easy mistake to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make even for bright capable folk.&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea what you are talking about.  
</em><br>
<p>I hope the comments above have clarified things a bit.
<br>
<p>The purpose of that above comment was for me to let it be known
<br>
that I respect the sensitivities of those who have invested much in
<br>
setting up and maintaining a group like this. Maybe I'm respecting
<br>
sensitivities that are not so much real as imagined :-). But in any case,
<br>
if any of the group of people who I perceive are most likely to be
<br>
watchful of the health of the list, of its content and its fluctuations - 
<br>
the committee I presumed, were concerned that my posts were
<br>
becoming too negative or being perceived as too negative then I
<br>
was giving notice that I would be receptive and respond positively
<br>
to any advice about such concerns *if* they arose, though I hoped
<br>
they wouldn't. 
<br>
<p>I was trying to be extremely careful. Quite likely my degree of caution
<br>
will strike some as excessive even bizarre. But I've been involved with
<br>
groups with good intentions before that had much less vitality, vigor 
<br>
and relevance. I wanted it known that it was my intention to do no harm.
<br>
And, to be honest, political animal that I am, I probably also wanted to
<br>
make space for myself to be more critical than I might otherwise get
<br>
away with if I had not given those who manage the list and keep a
<br>
watchful eye on the extropian &quot;brand&quot;  and its use and abuse a means
<br>
of reeling me in. 
<br>
<p>Wow I feel like I'm almost being neurotic. I think its partly that emailing
<br>
comes harder to me than talking and being in Oz rather than the US
<br>
I am relating to people I have not met and have only representations
<br>
of. And I know have only representations of me. I'd love to get to an
<br>
EXTRO meet one day. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Kind regards,
</em><br>
<p>Thank you : )  Accepted and reciprocated.
<br>
