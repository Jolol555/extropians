<p><em>&gt; [Kai writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; War against terrorism is not comparable with conventional wars. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means fighting against belief systems and against the causes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; motivation of those people. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, all wars are caused by different nations or cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having dissonant belief systems.  Wars are won when one side so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoroughly beats the crap out of the other that a state of cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shock occurs in the minds of the populace...
</em><br>
<p>There is a lot of truth in this.  Suppose that the U.S. had
<br>
really gone ballistic in the days following Sept. 11, had
<br>
adopted a full war-time economy, and had methodically invaded
<br>
Afghanistan, Iraq, and the whole Middle East.  For all the
<br>
belly-aching of the rest of the world, it definitely would
<br>
have set the terrorists back much further than they are.
<br>
<p>(Whether in retrospect that will turn out to have been
<br>
a good idea depends on how successful the present &quot;war&quot;
<br>
on terrorism is, and what the ultimate shakeout is.
<br>
Hopefully, such a sweeping response will be properly
<br>
judged by later history to have been an unnecessary
<br>
over-reaction, but if Middle Eastern nations do succeed
<br>
in arming terrorists with WMD, the U.S. will indeed
<br>
regret not having &quot;gone ballistic&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In WWII, we bombed... Germany so significantly that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of the populace [decided they wanted nothing ever to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with Hitlerian solutions]
</em><br>
<p>Yes, though in fairness, their consciences bothered them
<br>
as well.  Still, as you wrote, nothing creates
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a state of cognitive shock in [enemy] minds
</em><br>
<p>as a total and thorough drubbing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We kicked Japan's asses so hard that they realized that their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; militaristic regime was inferior...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the same thing there.  I do hope that the U.S. doesn't
<br>
soon regret not having conquered all nations harboring 
<br>
terrorists.  Observe that such an action would also have
<br>
had an effect on even the U.S.'s closest allies, prompting
<br>
them to greater domestic action.  Notable also would have
<br>
been the effect in Pakistan and North Korea, to mention
<br>
just two.
<br>
<p>People don't like to think about this, but *everyone* is
<br>
going to be SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED if during the next month
<br>
or so Saddam Hussein ignites a nuclear device in the Iraqi
<br>
dessert.  What would be even funnier would be if he announced
<br>
that he had succeeded in smuggling a few into the U.S. and
<br>
Europe, and that he did not intend to have a repetition of
<br>
the Gulf War take place.
<br>
<p>And I can just *hear* some people supporting him:  &quot;After
<br>
all,&quot; they'd say, &quot;is it fair that the U.S. can target
<br>
cities in Iraq and Iraq cannot target cities in the U.S.?
<br>
And if it is right for the U.S. to be able to nuke Iraqi cities,
<br>
why is it wrong for Iraq to be able to nuke American cities?&quot;
<br>
<p>How utterly logical.  And yet, how utterly puerile and stupid.
<br>
<p>Lee
