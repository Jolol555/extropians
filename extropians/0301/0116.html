Newspaper reports reveal London is introducing a fee to enter the central 
<br>
area of the city due to traffic jams occuring during 50% of driver time (we 
<br>
have had a similar system of monitoring for a private highway network in 
<br>
Melbourne called CityLink, using computer monitoring, it's been around 
<br>
several years).
<br>
<p>Assuming some form of car as we have today (four people in a 1.5m by 3m 
<br>
vehicle) and a single-level road (let's have it powered by the road surface 
<br>
via nanotech solar power)...
<br>
<p>If the cars are all computationally controlled, are traffic lights 
<br>
necessary? One would think not - they just criss cross each other 
<br>
constantly.
<br>
<p>Assuming we do not have a vacuum-tube style road, and assuming some distance 
<br>
between cars for criss-crossing and entering and leaving central lanes, and 
<br>
assuming no clover leaf patterns or underpasses and bypasses (i.e. the roads 
<br>
are roughly as they are now) does this make the maximum amount of traffic 
<br>
bearable something like 4 persons per 10 metres of track? At 60 k per hour = 
<br>
6 k per 6 minutes = 1 k per minute =  10 metres in a bit over half a second. 
<br>
So if your residential ratio on the streetfront is about ten metres per 
<br>
house and contains 4 persons who reside there, traffic should not be a 
<br>
problem provided you're not jumping off and on the road every quarter of a 
<br>
second.
<br>
<p>This is probably seriously flawed logic... automated public transport may 
<br>
take the form of minibuses (as in Johannesberg).
<br>
<p>I guess you could have Robert Heinlein-style walkways with people on &quot;sleds&quot; 
<br>
that can slide across fast and slow zones.
<br>
<p>There must be lots of possiblities (but please don't just say &quot;downloading 
<br>
via cable or laser is the fastest, since I am an augmentor not an uploading 
<br>
type)!
