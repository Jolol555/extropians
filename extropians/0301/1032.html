<p>Your failure, such as it is, does not completely cut out the other interpretations,
<br>
as I'm sure you must realize.
<br>
<p>Re your &quot;...might be able to figure out...&quot;: I'd take those odds and bet against it,
<br>
even then.
<br>
<p>Absent experience _plus_ really good intelligence (in the policy/military sense)
<br>
(i.e., a God's eye view hardly anyone, if anyone, ever gets)--figuring out
<br>
&quot;what the hell is actually going on&quot;, in Robert Anton Wilson's phrasing, is just
<br>
about impossible. It's another side of the dice we roll labeled &quot;Whom do you trust,
<br>
and on what basis?&quot;
<br>
<p>And we don't like that; we're wired to avoid that; so we seek the Big Certainty.
<br>
Each of us, in our way. Without Knowing The Story, we can't relax. If we can't relax,
<br>
we eventually kill ourselves and/or one another through distress.
<br>
<p>This might be the crux of the existential thing, in evolutionary psych terms.
<br>
Or my saying that could be an example of how much *I* crave Story, and nothing more.
<br>
<p>Sucks. War or no, people will suffer and people will die. Raymond Chandler, I think
<br>
it was, called every murder &quot;an act of infinite cruelty&quot;. Such a calculus puts
<br>
a sprinkling of infinite-altitude poppies in the grassy field of 6+ billion souls,
<br>
tiny but still undifferentiable singularities all over the place; and mocks the
<br>
notion of a utility function. &quot;I love mankind, it's people I can't stand.&quot;--Snoopy
<br>
<p>So is a &quot;collateral&quot; death in a war a murder? I don't like the answer I get.
<br>
<p>As Prof Paz (and probably LeFebre before him) asked:
<br>
<p>When is it right for a group to do that which it is wrong for an individual to do?
<br>
