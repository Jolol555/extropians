<p><em>&gt; &gt; A particular integer of this class exists as certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as does the number 17, and like 17 has many objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; properties.  That this integer is not as *manifest*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to human intelligence as the number 17 doesn't change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, that integer does not exist as long as you don't write it down, all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, or at least have given a production system allowing to reconstruct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that integer in a given shared context.  Once you've scanned yourself, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encoded that pattern into a material carrier, you can truthfully state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that number exists. Before, it's just a promise.
</em><br>
<p>Are you claiming that there was a particular point in history
<br>
at which the integer 1729 came into existence?  Might I ask
<br>
when this occurred?  Might I ask where it came into existence?
<br>
In the vicinity of the Earth, or did its existence propagate
<br>
with speed c away from the solar system?
<br>
<p>Universal constraints exist and have always existed that forbid
<br>
certain arrangements of matter.  We call some of those constraints
<br>
mathematics.  However vast the universe is, and however far back in
<br>
time it goes, you will look in vain to find seventeen particles in
<br>
deep space arranged in a rectangle with more rows than one.  This
<br>
is because seventeen is prime, and has always been prime.  We do
<br>
not invent these constraints; we discover them!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That patterns already exist is something which doesn't come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; easily to even most 21st century people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Patterns are information. Information doesn't exist without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a material carrier.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds logical, but I don't really believe it is.  The Mandelbrot
<br>
set, for example, carries a lot of information, but we are ill-advised
<br>
to suppose that it only came into existence with the work of Julia.
<br>
Like the above, it was another universal constraint that human beings
<br>
happened upon in a certain year, but that other intelligent material
<br>
will chance upon or have chanced upon themselves.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Permutation City&quot; raised consciousness on this topic as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so often science fiction writers are the first to do.  With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his &quot;Theory of Dust&quot;, he helps to prepare minds for the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that whether a pattern exists on in computer memory, or on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disk, or on paper cards, or in a biological organism, or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain places in intergalactic space in the form of dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particles, doesn't matter a whit.  Patterns are forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A pattern is meaningless in absence of an encoding and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decoding system.  The Mars face is only a face as long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are monkeys which can interpret that pattern as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faceness.
</em><br>
<p>I think that there really is or is not a face on Mars.
<br>
(Almost certainly not.)  But if there is a face---in
<br>
sufficient detail to provide isomorphism to bipedal
<br>
symmetrical creatures who have a pair of eyes, a nose,
<br>
and a mouth---then this is just a fact.  A detailed
<br>
isomorphism exists, or it does not.  If it does, then
<br>
a signature test is that (as I said before) even mildly
<br>
intelligent machinery from anywhere in the universe can
<br>
discern this fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IIRC, the extreme position of the 'dust theory' is that an enumeration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all possible patterns -- regardless of sequence of occurrence, whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporal or spatial -- implements all known realities. I don't agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this interpretation.
</em><br>
<p>Nor do I.  And you give a great reason here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming I have a specific system's evolution trajectory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can I randomly jumble the frames, and still claim it's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same trajectory?  I don't think so.  Each frame follows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from another via iterative transformation.  I cannot skip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frames, short-cutting terrain in between without actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing the computation work.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  This is where Egan went wrong (though he makes it clear
<br>
that he doesn't always believe what his books suggest).  I
<br>
have called this a &quot;succession of frozen states&quot;, and it cannot
<br>
replace or emulate states that pass information.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why should some strings such as the above get run time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and not others?  More importantly, who should decide?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The answers are clear if you cast away ancient prejudices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and try to be logical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not logic, Lee.  You've built your system on a set of random 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms.  Not shared by most people.  I notice you're making a pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being consistently unreasonable.
</em><br>
<p>I'm noticing that you're making a pattern of falling
<br>
into wasteful dismissals unsupported by argument, and
<br>
which then sometimes fall further into ad hominem
<br>
(though not this time, thanks!  Other posters the
<br>
last week or so weren't so lucky as I.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!  It's you who is being unreasonable!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!  It's you who are resorting to bad axioms!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!  You're the one who isn't using logic!&quot;
<br>
<p>Ya see, anybody could do that, and it gets
<br>
us exactly... nowhere.  It beats me why so many
<br>
people waste their time that way, and you are
<br>
hardly the worst offender!  But I digress.
