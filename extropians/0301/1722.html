<em>&gt; So you say that you use natural frequencies (e.g. &quot;eight in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ten&quot;) rather than using probabilities &quot;.8&quot; or &quot;80%&quot;, and you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that this affects your thinking?
</em><br>
<p>My understanding of this research is that by frequencies they mean
<br>
&quot;once every 10 years&quot; as opposed to &quot;10% chance per year&quot;.  Obviously
<br>
this is easier to express with low probabilities / frequencies.  I
<br>
suspect that with a scenario like &quot;eight in every ten people&quot; vs. &quot;80%
<br>
of all people&quot; the effect shrinks, as the frequency formulation of the
<br>
problem rises in complexity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have been very interested in probability and probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems for more decades than is pleasant to contemplate.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have supposed that for me there could be no possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference.  But if it's really true that there is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference, I naturally would like to change my mental habits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think that this holds also for people used to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability problems?
</em><br>
<p>The general finding that humans understand frequencies better than
<br>
probabilities is a few years old.  If I recall it correctly, there was
<br>
still a very noticeable effect even among those who had a fair bit of
<br>
experience with statistics, though it was smaller among that
<br>
population than the general public.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
