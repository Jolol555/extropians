<p>
Perhaps there is an opportunity for an extropic public service.
<br>
<p>Seems Clonaid just keep on making cloning claims without
<br>
providing evidence and the journos just keep on publishing them
<br>
anyway. This naturally gives Clonaid free publicity and plays straight
<br>
into the hands of those who use every story on irresponsible science
<br>
to try and tighten the laws against therapeutic cloning. See
<br>
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/SciTech/reuters20030108_502.html">http://abcnews.go.com/wire/SciTech/reuters20030108_502.html</a>
<br>
(NB. A ban on &quot;all human cloning&quot; would ban therapeutic cloning too).
<br>
<p>Extropians *should* care about this because if therapeutic cloning
<br>
was able to be performed more often in a discovery science context
<br>
it would almost certainly increase the rate at which biological
<br>
knowledge of cell differentiation processes would be understood
<br>
and allow us to better direct particular tissue growth. This knowledge
<br>
would feed directly into the rate at which tissue and organ replacements
<br>
are likely to become available for those that need them. IE. It *ought*
<br>
to hit extropes right where they live - literally.  (If we could be sure
<br>
that the political and legislative environments in our countries would not
<br>
be used to place unnecessary prohibitions on medical and scientific
<br>
research in biotech it is very likely that we would be able to replace
<br>
all parts of our bodies excepting the brain and CNS within the next
<br>
30 years - using only the technique of applied biology. This would
<br>
buy time to address the problems of aging brains still within the life
<br>
times of many of us. Any input from singularities, friendly GAI, and
<br>
general purpose nanoassemblers would then, whilst gratefully and
<br>
happily accepted, be a bonus rather than a necessity.)

<p>Reporter Elizabeth Weise saw fit to sign her article. Very nice of her.
<br>
<p>In an unwitting spruik for Clonaid and probably an equally unwitting
<br>
eye-poke for therapeutic cloning she writes:
<br>
<p>&quot;The group that says it produced the world's first cloned children
<br>
says a third baby born Wednesday in Japan is a clone of a Japanese
<br>
couple's 2-year-old son who died 18 months ago.
<br>
<p>None of the three alleged clonings has been independently verified&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's right. So why is she still seeing it as worth reporting?
<br>
Answer. - She's probably not knowledgeable enough to ask the
<br>
sort of questions that would make her a better journalist. And
<br>
sensational stories like cloning still sells. There is no protocol for
<br>
her, or her media colleagues, to hold her accountable to, in the
<br>
public interest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article goes on to say..
<br>
<p>&quot;In a telephone interview from Toronto, Clonaid Director Brigette
<br>
Boisselier said the boy born Wednesday was carried by a surrogate
<br>
because the real mother was 41 and there was concern that a
<br>
miscarriage would be more likely because of her age.
<br>
<p>When the boy died, Clonaid took cells from his body, cultured
<br>
them and used them to create the baby, Boisselier said.&quot;
<br>
<p>This means had Boisselier kept some of the cultured cells which
<br>
were cloned from the original child and had she forwarded them
<br>
along with the placenta from the birth of the child to a lab capable of
<br>
extracting DNA from each of the tissue samples it would have been
<br>
possible to determine if the placental tissue (implies infant aged DNA)
<br>
and the cells (another older source of exactly the same DNA! ) it
<br>
would have been possible to determine if the two obviously different
<br>
tissue types from individuals of different ages contained exactly the
<br>
same genotype - without the need for any identification of the
<br>
individuals concerned at all.
<br>
<p>Had the alleged clone been of the same sort as Clonaid's first
<br>
claim. Where the mother cloned herself and bore her clone. A toe
<br>
nail clipping from the mothers big toe (too large for an infant to
<br>
produce) and the placental material could have been forwarded
<br>
to a lab. The tissues in this case would also be (if the cloning had
<br>
actually occurred) of exactly the same genotype but an individual
<br>
able to produce adult sized toe nails is unlikely to have a placenta
<br>
with the same genotype lying about unless there has been a cloning
<br>
event. The different ages of the tissues containing the same DNA
<br>
would seem to be excellent evidence of a cloning event and requires
<br>
not disclosure of the identity of the child or parent concerned. They
<br>
could remain anonymous and need fear no prosecution. Proof of the
<br>
claim would serve Clonaid if it was true - they haven't been reporting
<br>
clones in the media for nothing - all publicity has been good so far.
<br>
<p>So can you actually get DNA from a toenail?  Seems you can.
<br>
<p>I did a google on &quot;toenail&quot; + &quot;forensic&quot; + &quot;dna&quot; and found a link to
<br>
this 1999 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences.
<br>
<p>A Validation Study for the Extraction and Analysis of DNA from
<br>
Human Nail Material and its Application to Forensic Casework.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=cache:xHF0Z3KuhWgC:aafs.micronexx.com/PDF/">http://www.google.com.au/search?q=cache:xHF0Z3KuhWgC:aafs.micronexx.com/PDF/</a>
<br>
JOFS/JFS4451053/JFS4451053.pdf+toenail+forensic+dna+&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8
<br>
<p>The success rate was only 76% and normally there are easier
<br>
sources of DNA so you'd need a good reason to try and extract
<br>
it from a toenail. But its clearly possible and the method for doing
<br>
it is published right there in this scientific journal.
<br>
<p>So the next time Clonaid or anyone else you bump into on the
<br>
street reckons they've got a clone they produced in their back
<br>
shed. Ask them politely for the placenta and a toenail or ask
<br>
them politely to shut the hell up as they are using the media and
<br>
journalistic gullibility and opportunism in a way that if unchecked
<br>
may extend the delivery time on replacement tissues and organs
<br>
that one day *you* or someone else you care about might need.
<br>
<p>If the jouno that wrote this article was in Australia I might follow up at
<br>
this point and invite her to clarify why she was still reporting Clonaid's
<br>
unverified claims. Wouldn't she prefer to demand proof of them? Then
<br>
very quicky I let her know the protocol. Actually, I would check out,
<br>
the viability of what I was proposing with the lab first, but I reckon the
<br>
sort of folks that mess about in labs like this one actually *like* to talk
<br>
to folk about this sort of application of their work.
<br>
<p>If this protocol for proving (or disproving the existence of clones) is
<br>
valid and becomes public knowledge then journalists would be able to
<br>
respond to Clonaid or others with &quot;put up or shut up&quot;. To not do so
<br>
would open them to the charge of irresponsible journalism against the
<br>
public interest. Especially as I could send the protocol to a bunch of
<br>
newpapers at the same time pointing out that there was now a way to
<br>
call Clonaid bluff and inviting them to consider the public service record
<br>
of their competitors who would report just for the hell of it. Or heck,
<br>
one could send it straight to Clonaid, Vincenti and a selection of the
<br>
worlds media in the same post with a little preparation. Then it would
<br>
be interesting to see who would approach who first and what sport
<br>
the non-approached media outlets might make of any colleague that
<br>
scooped them and gave the alleged Cloners some free publicity
<br>
without challenging them to put up.
<br>
<p>I reckon if a few sciencey extropes QA'd my protocol then we could
<br>
work out a pretty effective bluff calling procedure that we could then
<br>
forward on to journalists. Perhaps this could give budding young
<br>
extropes interested in adding some political and media skills to their
<br>
repertoire of actions something to cut their political and activist teeth
<br>
on.
<br>
<p>In democracies we only get one vote each (just like the President)
<br>
but we also get the right to free speech. Its how we use this right to
<br>
speak and what we actually say and to whom we actually say it that
<br>
determines how effective we are in propagating the changes we
<br>
desire in our societies. Some might think politics is a dirty game.
<br>
Those who oppose extropic aims might well be glad if they think so.
<br>
If we don't use our right to free speech and free association to learn
<br>
and to play the political game well but instead we leave the arena free
<br>
for others who are willing to step forward and use it, learn it and play
<br>
it. Picture a smiling beneficent Leon Kass. He know's what's best for
<br>
us. Personally, I'd rather have knowledge empowered extropes
<br>
working the various political and media hustings in as many democratic
<br>
countries as possible - they at least share most of my values.
<br>
<p>Alas, if only we had a wiki, (sigh) where, (amongst other things) we
<br>
might be able to dig out some practical extropic knowledge, get it
<br>
down and leverage it in such a way as to empower each other to be
<br>
more effective in promoting extropic policies and outcomes in our
<br>
local communities :(
