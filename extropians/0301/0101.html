Natasha writes, addressing me, Lee Corbin
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You said in your post, &quot;Although overly verbose, it raises 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many good questions that the transhumanists appear to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more concerned about than do extropians.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee, what are you talking about?  What do you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that extropians and transhumanists are a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group of people.  Extropians are transhumanists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you mean ExI is not interested in dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, state it.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not even sure what ExI is the way you're using it here;
<br>
what I was bemoaning was that these issues don't get the
<br>
critical examination on this list that they once did.
<br>
<p>Lee Daniel Crocker explained it well:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That was Lee Corbin, but I take your point.  His lack of quantifier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is confusing, and may be intepreted by some to indicate disjoint or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrelated sets.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I meant no such separation, except as perhaps by
<br>
who posts to what lists.  It's pretty obvious that
<br>
extropians are a kind of transhumanist movement, and
<br>
I appreciate that Olga and others saw that logically,
<br>
my wording was not incorrect.  But sorry I caused the
<br>
confusion.
<br>
<p>I remain completely ignorant of what goes on on the
<br>
Transhumanist list.  (If I had more spare time, then
<br>
I would study SL4 anyway, not that.)  I have only
<br>
gathered that every defect one can perceive about
<br>
this forum is greatly magnified there.  If anyone
<br>
knows better, please enlighten me.
<br>
<p>I don't mind anyone being picky about terms while the
<br>
meanings are still inchoate.
<br>
<p>Lee
