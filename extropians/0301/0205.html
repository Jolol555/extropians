The Edge.org has posted its responses to a hypthetical question posed by 
<br>
President Bush to various scientists: &quot;What are the pressing scientific 
<br>
issues for the nation and the world, and what is your advice on how I can 
<br>
begin to deal with them?&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.edge.org/q2003/question03_index.html">http://www.edge.org/q2003/question03_index.html</a>
<br>
<p>Some very interesting contributions. Here's a couple of samples to pique 
<br>
your interest:
<br>
<p>K. Eric Drexler: &quot;Advanced nanotechnologies, based on molecular 
<br>
manufacturing, will enable the production of computer systems a billion 
<br>
times more powerful than today's, aerospace vehicles with 98% less 
<br>
structural mass, and medical tools enabling molecular repair of cells, 
<br>
tissues, and organs. These and related technologies will be economically and 
<br>
strategically decisive.&quot;
<br>
<p>Joel Garreau: &quot;We are entering an era of scientific change that is rocking 
<br>
no less than human nature itself. This directed evolution is unprecedented. 
<br>
It is convulsing everything from the affairs of state, to defense, to 
<br>
commerce, to labor, to education, to health, to welfare, to the economy. It 
<br>
is not science fiction. It has begun to occur and is accelerating this 
<br>
decade. You need an advisor who can help you try to ride this curve of 
<br>
change.&quot;
<br>
<p>Eduardo Punset: &quot;Science is pointing towards an LSD-like world without LSD 
<br>
intake. And we are wholly unprepared for both. Math, Physics, Chemistry, 
<br>
Biology and Psychology—the things we are made of—are inextricably 
<br>
intertwined. People though, remain interactiveless and disentangled.&quot;
<br>
<p>Lee Smolin: &quot;In the modern world, science, democracy and prosperity go hand 
<br>
in hand, and it is no coincidence that throughout history those nations that 
<br>
led the development of democracy also led their times in scientific 
<br>
advancement.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ray Kurzweil: &quot;... my proposal is on a different front: to dramatically 
<br>
increase funding for promising new methodologies in the field of &quot;human 
<br>
somatic cell engineering,&quot; which bypass entirely fetal stem cells. These 
<br>
emerging technologies create new tissues with a patient's own DNA by 
<br>
modifying one type of cell (such as a skin cell) directly into another (such 
<br>
as a pancreatic Islet cell or a heart cell) without the use of fetal stem 
<br>
cells.&quot;
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
George
