<em>&gt; &gt; It's interesting (and depressing) to consider that this list has a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; topics like this one, much of the level of debate is at the bar-room
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>One thing that has always really got on my tits! (Annoyed me, for all of you 
<br>
that are not British) Is the fact that IQ tests are timed. As a sufferer of 
<br>
dyslexicia &lt;G&gt; I have always felt very hard done by when completing said 
<br>
tests. It takes me an age to read  the questions and another age to reread 
<br>
them just to make sure I got it right the first time. 
<br>
Even the so called Culturally unbiased test (LOL, unbiased!) are a challenge. 
<br>
Which of these dancing, blurry psychedelically coloured iterations off the 
<br>
pattern is next?  
<br>
How about giving me a chance to comprehend what i'm actually seeing before 
<br>
you tell me the time is up. Surely the measure of intelligence can be 
<br>
calculated by whether or not you can answer the question correctly. Rather 
<br>
than simply how fast you can finish it. 
<br>
<p>I know this may cause some of you to say that speed does indicate the level 
<br>
of intelligence. I'd say I do agree. Only the speed of the mental calculation 
<br>
of the answer, not the speed of reading the question.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;Thank God for spell check!&quot;
