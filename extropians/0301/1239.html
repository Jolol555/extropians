<p><em>&gt; What I am saying is plain English--the very concept of &quot;country&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an outdated an irrelevant one, and if you continue to think in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those terms I remain unmoved.
</em><br>
<p>I'm a little amazed to hear that you believe the
<br>
concept to be outmoded.  Countries, I admit, are
<br>
a (low order) reification of certain societies,
<br>
but even that term you might suspect.
<br>
<p>Countries appear to take actions, act like they
<br>
have feelings, or have thought certain things
<br>
collectively.  I'll agree that there is little
<br>
&quot;fact of the matter&quot; here, but I'm still surprised
<br>
at your take.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; My standards, as I've said time and again quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly to everyone capable of listening, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply that /people/ have the right to defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves or others against other people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would harm them or take their freedom.  Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument for going to war must be framed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that context for me to take it seriously.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Should the USA attack Iraq&quot; is not even a legitimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question to me: the question is &quot;Will it serve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American and/or Iraqi people for their present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to send troops to attack the Iraqi army
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or remove Saddam Hussein from power?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a lot of us just find that quite an acceptable
<br>
question, and quite equivalent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I am totally unconcerned with the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I should &quot;respect&quot; the sovereignty or government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Iraq, or indeed of any country on Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including my own.  I don't give a damn about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries, I care about people.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a rational argument right now; but I
<br>
suspect that people and nations *treat* other 
<br>
nations as nations for a reason.  An evolutionarily
<br>
derived reason.

<p><em>&gt; The immediate effect on war would be negative, assuming that some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would die before they would have died if the war would not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened.  How many people?  No idea.  Some people said 100,000 on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last one, so if there's a repeat, I would consider it a big negative (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bus crashes and 10 people die is &quot;tragedy&quot;, and 3000 on WTC qualifies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for &quot;horrible, despicable event&quot; and 6,000,000 gets a &quot;holocaust&quot;, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100,000 probably hits around &quot;unbelievable massacre&quot; label or so). 
</em><br>
<p>Don't forget the &quot;Iraq/Iran war&quot; level.  About 200,000 thousand
<br>
had been killed *before* the &quot;war of attrition&quot; began.
<br>
<a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/war/iran-iraq.htm">http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/war/iran-iraq.htm</a>
<br>
a nice history of the whole war.  In total, about a million died,
<br>
it seems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There would also be a sizable negative property score for damaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buildings in Iraq, probably a sizable positive property score to the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military business and to world media businesses, some points for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoyment of &quot;marines getting some action&quot;, some for the US population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling safer, some subtracted for some of the US population feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilty, and a sizable negative score for Iraqi suffering at the loss of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatives and friends, but none of those (except maybe by the last one),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would think, would put much of a dent on the -100,000 full points that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we started with.
</em><br>
<p>You also need to score (a) the relief that many Iraqis
<br>
will feel when Hussein is gone (b) the potential for
<br>
many further deaths over the rest of his and his son's
<br>
lives, and (c) the (admittedly unquantifiable) benefits
<br>
that could accrue to other nations, especially Islamic
<br>
ones, in the region.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, since the post-war effects are unknown, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't assign probabilities to what the possible outcomes will be (if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can, please post), they would have to be given a neutral or zero score. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In which case the war stays at &quot;unbelievable massacre&quot; level, and should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a no-go.
</em><br>
<p>Having good judgment about the myriads of factors is
<br>
something that I believe can be left to the professionals
<br>
who are employed by the various governments;  that such
<br>
professionals will not agree, however, bespeaks both the
<br>
difficulty of any final say, and the ideological component,
<br>
which is based ultimately on differing values.
