</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       Worse yet, is he suggesting that we should surrender
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;any claim to our natural right to his or someone else's decision?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly not.  I just wish I knew what you were talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel like I did as a little boy in Sunday School when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kept talking about the Trinity.  Now God, and Jesus, I understood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what was this Holy Ghost thingy?  Surely (though I did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possess the vocabulary at the time) it was a figure of speech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like &quot;there was a spirit of happiness at the party&quot;.  SURELY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THESE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ADULTS DID NOT BELIEVE IN A TRUE GHOST!
</em><br>
<p>Er, that isn't what the Holy Ghost was sposed to be.  Of course 
<br>
this entire Trinity thing was one of the most useless things 
<br>
ever sweated out by the early Catholic Church.  But the HG is 
<br>
not a ghost even in the theology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, but years later I learned, yes they did.  Well, maybe not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the liberal-cum-atheists in the Methodist Church, but the true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trinitarians did and do.
</em><br>
<p>Of course all of this is perfectly irrelevant and might even be 
<br>
consider dishonest argumentative technique of tossing out 
<br>
something else you believe most readers will find ridiculous and 
<br>
using that to cast ridicule on natural rights by fast and loose 
<br>
association.  I wish you would refrain from using such tactics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is a natural right?  Who issued it?  From whence does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it come, or emanate?  Surely it cannot be found anywhere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way that real laws can (i.e., recorded in statutes).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, it's not been found in our DNA, nor does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show up in anthropological studies.  What the hell are we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No one &quot;issues&quot; a natural right.  It wouldn't be natural if it 
<br>
was &quot;issued&quot;. It is a property of the sentient being concerned 
<br>
due to its specific nature and the needs implied by that nature 
<br>
in social groupings.  This is not the first time I have 
<br>
explained that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I say &quot;certainly not&quot; above, I mean that I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intention of surrendering any of my legal rights as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen of a Western nation.  (While under the circumstances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not believe that John Ashcroft and his ilk have gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too far yet, the further that they do go, the more I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resist.)  On many other fronts, Western governments, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S.'s, have indeed gone way too far, as any libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So is there any basis to a claim that the rights recognized by 
<br>
&quot;a Western nation&quot; are better than the ones recognized (or not) 
<br>
by other nations?  Do you believe that claimed is based on other 
<br>
than your preference?  If so, then what is that basis?
