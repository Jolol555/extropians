<p>
Brett scolds me for discoursing on the theme &quot;People pretending
<br>
to be an authority on what other people's (or nation's) motives
<br>
are&quot;, and I admit that while that may sound relevant to this
<br>
thread, I got carried away and brought up material that should
<br>
properly be associated with other threads.
<br>
<p>My apology.  However, Brett was incorrect in saying that this
<br>
was &quot;rude&quot; of me.  Correct would be &quot;thoughtless&quot;---but I'm
<br>
hardly the only one who needs more discipline in keeping
<br>
threads separate and making new ones when appropriate.
<br>
<p>But strictly back to the subject:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This choice, either to pursue &quot;point scoring&quot; or to pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;deeper understanding&quot; seems available to each of us each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  time we post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I wish I had a dollar for every time on this forum this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useless sentiment has been expressed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see very little sentiment (useless or otherwise) in the statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.
</em><br>
<p>Okay; I used the wrong word *again*.  Jeez.  I should have said
<br>
&quot;opinion&quot;.  Gimme a break.  Must I scrutinize *every* word I use?
<br>
Could you try harder to get the drift?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I certainly wasn't looking to do anything so pointless as express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere sentiment.  I hoped to highlight a fundamental choice that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each poster gets to make each time they post - to &quot;pursue point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scoring&quot; or to &quot;pursue deeper understanding&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think there is no such choice?
</em><br>
<p>No, I agree with you that there is often such a choice.
<br>
Yet what you consider to be mere point-scoring is in
<br>
fact often constructive criticism.  If someone thinks that
<br>
an idea someone else has contains a serious flaw, then
<br>
he should attempt to shoot the idea down.  Now, if 
<br>
that occurs, who among us isn't inclined to put another
<br>
notch on his missile launcher?
<br>
<p>You may suppose that such inclinations smack of game-
<br>
playing, and yes, such a component exists.  I might
<br>
point out, however, that the whole adversarial process
<br>
of law is based upon opportunistic exploitation of
<br>
these human tendencies.  I think that we should live
<br>
with a balance between the utterly rigorous and detached
<br>
(and sometimes boring), and the visceral.
<br>
<p>Nature will take its course so far as list dynamics go,
<br>
just as in all other human affairs, and the prohibitionists
<br>
eventually wise up and understand that suggesting tiny
<br>
course corrections is one thing, and profitable, but
<br>
revolutionary and radical programs are something else,
<br>
and inevitably fail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that if people are talking face to face either one to one or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in groups that a different set of dynamics apply than apply on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list where posts are sequential.  I think a list structure favours the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;point scoring&quot; mindset as opposed to the &quot;seeking deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding&quot; mindset more than face to face does.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'll agree, at least to some extent.  The phenomenon
<br>
of flaming is greatly magnified by the presence of a large
<br>
audience; witness the American newspapers of the 1790's
<br>
which make most on-line flame wars paltry affairs in comparison.
<br>
<p>But we are talking here about one's adversarial nature
<br>
or opinionated nature, which is simply set differently
<br>
in different people.  Get a crowd around a couple of the
<br>
usual Extropian wranglers at someone's house after an
<br>
Extro conference, and I predict you'll see I'm right.
<br>
<p>Why, I've often had many quite heated and totally argumentative
<br>
discussions alone with a close friend.  To take my former
<br>
example, fire and ice, (i.e., Mike Lorrey and Anders Sandberg),
<br>
it would be quite interesting to find out if Mike would lower
<br>
Anders' boiling point, or Anders would raise Mike's, in a 
<br>
face to face discussion, though probably not as interesting
<br>
as attending to what they were actually saying. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is easier to tell in the more context rich face to face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment if people are serious, interested, in the middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a conversation that matters to them or merely shooting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breeze, and so in a face to face circumstances I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;point scoring&quot; debater mindset would stand out more blatantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as rude and damaging and that people would therefore do it less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a consequence of the richer feedback that they'd get.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that doesn't match my experience very well.  The people
<br>
that I know (at work, for example) usually are tending towards
<br>
what you'd call the &quot;point-scoring&quot; end of the continuum, (what
<br>
I'd call the adversarial mode), when, say political matters
<br>
come up.  What are your experiences with people, both as an
<br>
observer and participant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Consider the exchange between Anders and Mike:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Anders wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One prerequisite for having a constructive discussion about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; powerful topic is to be able to handle it on a high level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; abstraction. When you know enough about a topic you can start to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; look at it from different sides. You can be abstract enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it so that you become dispassionate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Mike replied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; On the contrary, the more you know about a topic, when that topic turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; on Objective Truth, the more likely you are to be very passionate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the side which you are able to objectively, quantitatively, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; qualitatively determine is in the right. The opposition begins, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and more, to look not just wrong, but foolish, naive, stubbornly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; obstinate in their willful ignorance, and willing to believe anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that agrees with their prejudices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's quite clear that the more someone learns about an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; issue, the less affected is his or her basic personality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disposition!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what your saying. It seems that, your saying that, as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of knowledge one has on a subject increases one's personality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or) personal disposition, is less (e)ffected by each further unit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increment.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, it was a joke, or at least was rather ironical, to
<br>
phrase it just that way.  It misfired (my fault).  I meant
<br>
to say that their basic personality dispositions are hardly
<br>
affected at all by how much they learn about a matter (with
<br>
some notable exceptions in some people and on some topics---
<br>
I have noticed that I shut up, or at least become much more
<br>
conciliatory after someone has made me realize an error that
<br>
I had been making).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Those who start by being quite opinionated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remain that way, and those who tend to reserve judgment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have &quot;working hypotheses&quot;, be indecisive, and so on, tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to remain their way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't agree with the view that having a working hypothesis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indecision amount to the same thing, which seems to be what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are saying.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the wrong word again.  Replace &quot;indecisive&quot; with &quot;less
<br>
decisive&quot;.  I only mean the opposite of &quot;quite opinionated&quot;
<br>
which maybe you should have picked up on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And neither speaker here is distinguishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between ordinary discussions of near-fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and discussions laced with ideology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I could hold someone to blame for not distinguishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;near-fact&quot; from anything. What is a near-fact? How near?
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;near-fact&quot; I was trying to connote troublesome examples
<br>
that should be matters of fact, but which are, for various
<br>
reasons, not, e.g., historical accounts.  We probably are
<br>
best off to view the difference between facts and opinions
<br>
as also on a continuum, though with the two ends more 
<br>
prominent than in many other continuums.
<br>
<p>As an example of what I was talking about, suppose that a
<br>
scientific discussion of &quot;entropy&quot; was in progress, and
<br>
suppose that there aren't any strong ideological movements
<br>
separating people's views about entropy.  What Anders and
<br>
Mike said, while entirely correct IMO for discussions like
<br>
that, was not correct when considering ideological debates.
<br>
Anders had written
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you know enough about a topic you can start to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look at it from different sides.  You can be abstract
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough about it so that you become dispassionate.
<br>
<p>which is true enough, if you are talking about entropy.
<br>
But it fails spectacularly if you (most people) are
<br>
talking about the Vietnam War.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is *extremely* difficult not to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somewhat biased perspective on the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [ideological] issues, and only a fool has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such prejudices about matters of fact!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But now you seem to be moving near-fact into fact.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  It would be hasty to call someone a fool for
<br>
being prejudicial about matters in which opinion or
<br>
ideology was even a tiny component.  Not that that
<br>
stops a lot of people.
