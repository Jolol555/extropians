<p>&quot;Unextropic? This whole war option is unextropic. Relying on war to address
<br>
symptoms of bigger problems; it's the attitude &quot;If you can't fix it with a
<br>
hammer, you can't fix it&quot;. &quot;
<br>
<p>A more accurate description of the pro-IRAQ war stances would be 'It can not
<br>
be fixed anyother way, they have been tried, now we must fix it with a
<br>
hammer'  Your charachterization sacrifices the truths behind a complex
<br>
subject for the sake of a good sounding one-liner.  Since we are all
<br>
extropians here, it is clear that I and other pro-IRAQ war argues do indeed
<br>
feel that ousting Sadam is an 'extropic' event, since we consider the
<br>
perpetuation of corrupt despotic murderous racist progress hating dictators
<br>
to, seemingly reasonable enough, NOT be extropic.  We are not, despite the
<br>
perceptual bias of our detractors, merely out to see humans die horrible
<br>
violent deaths for no good reason.  In fact we feel we are justified in
<br>
claiming that this will prevent innumerably more horrible violent deaths
<br>
from occuring in the future.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Some random related points off the top of my head:
<br>
- Get off oil. There are a *lot* of alternatives these days, which just need
<br>
some investment.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sure, its called Nuclear power, and has successfully been fought every step
<br>
of the way by greens and environmentalists.  In fact one could make a sound
<br>
argument that environmentalists, specifically anti-nuclear activists, have
<br>
actually contributed to global warming more than any other special interest
<br>
group, since they effectively outlawed and brought to a screeching halt the
<br>
natural tendancy of science and technology to create cleaner and safer power
<br>
generation methods in free, market based environmetns, in this case nuclear
<br>
ones that did not release CO2, did not release particulates and cause some
<br>
few thousands deaths every year, and do not frequantly accidentaly explode
<br>
(as natural gas does) killing a few hundred more every year.  Continuing the
<br>
Nuclear power generation and construction rates that were gaining steam when
<br>
the Anti-nukes started their campaigns would have brought us to some 80% of
<br>
our power from nuclear sources today.  
<br>
<p>But if you feel there are other alternatives, present them, or through your
<br>
money into investing in them.  Meanwhile, while greens and anti-war
<br>
protestors are sitting around waiting for 'alternatives' Saddam, as a
<br>
murderous west hating anti-extropic dictator, controls the worlds second
<br>
larges cheap abundant energy supply in the world.  
<br>
<p>&quot;- Why can't we cooperate? What's the story with the whole nation gig,
<br>
anyway? Why do we get bucketloads of implicit and explicit nationalism and
<br>
jingoism on extro-l of all places?&quot;
<br>
<p>You may be implying that I am a 'jingoist' for being pro-IRAQ war, on the
<br>
contrary, I would assert that you are for being against it, since that
<br>
necessarily perpetates the regime of a murderous dictator.  And you are
<br>
right, what in the world are thoughts like that doing on an extropy list?
<br>
<p>&quot;- If you intend to wage war for peace and freedom, to free people from the
<br>
chains of their oppressors, surely you would open your borders to those same
<br>
people. In fact, if much of the world is oppressed by dictators, and you
<br>
decide you have to beat them (ie: their people) senseless/dead in order to
<br>
free them from their chains, why wouldn't you fight also to open borders?&quot;
<br>
<p>I, and most libertarians I have interacted with, are all for open borders.
<br>
However, the oppressive dictators are the ones who are much worse about
<br>
boarders, as they typically have to build walls and control all forms of
<br>
information to keep people from, surprisingly, wanting to flee their corrupt
<br>
despotic dictatorships.
