I have just joined extropians and I'm pleasantly suprised by the range of 
<br>
topics here. I hope I'm not too off topic by contributing to this thread but 
<br>
this is one of my favorite subjects...
<br>
<p>Anyhow, about the price of oil, one big factor in price is taxes. No suprise 
<br>
there. However I suggest that the relationship might be a little different 
<br>
than one might first assume. Huh? Surely if you tax oil, the price goes up. 
<br>
Perhaps, perhaps not. Here is my reasoning:
<br>
<p>i.   Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
<br>
ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally rise.
<br>
iii.  Alternatives to oil based products appear a little cheaper. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling instead of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driving etc.
<br>
iv.  Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
<br>
v.   Demand for oil decreases slightly
<br>
vi.  To maintain revenues oil producers drop prices a little (*)
<br>
<p>Now, assume for a minute that the increased tax revenues taken in by taxing 
<br>
the oil are used to displace some other tax burden (yes, yes, an unlikely 
<br>
scenario). Then:
<br>
<p>a.   The nation sees no net change in the tax burden
<br>
b.   The nation sees a net decrease in the price of oil
<br>
c.   The oil producing country has a little less income from oil
<br>
<p>The net effect: a reduction in the price of oil from the nations perspective. 
<br>
I.e. by taxing crude oil an oil importing country can trim some of the 
<br>
windfall profits from the oil exporting country.
<br>
<p>For the above reasoning I am not considering transient effects. Transient 
<br>
effects and unintended consequences might include things like decreased 
<br>
economic activity, political unrest, me having to sell my beloved gas 
<br>
guzzling SUV etc...
<br>
<p>A fun thought experiment eh? The best evidence in support of this argument 
<br>
are some of the strong statements the oil producing countries (especially 
<br>
OPEC) make against consumer countries taxing oil.

(*) Of course they could increase prices but remember there really is a free 
market at work in the oil arena. If one producer increases price they are 
likely to see market share fall.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The price of oil is subject to a complex &quot;present value
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analysis&quot; of both the countries producing it and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consumers.  It comes down to a question of &quot;do I gain
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more by pumping the oil or leaving it in the ground?&quot;.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Lee responds
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Who ever gains more by leaving it the ground?  (Besides
&gt; &gt; &gt; U.S. farmers, I mean.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Many people I'm afraid. It's a question of time horizons. You compare the
&gt; &gt; return you would get by pumping the oil now to what you might get in the
&gt; &gt; future assuming (a) you, your heirs or assigns will still control it  (b)
&gt; &gt; other sources have been depleted in the meantime and (c) there's been no
&gt; &gt; technological breakthrough in the meantime to cause a slump in demand.
&gt; &gt; This doesn't just apply to oil the same is true of other resources, above
&gt; &gt; all land. It can pay not to develop land but to leave it idle if this
&gt; &gt; leads to a rise in its capital value or to a rise in rents at a future
&gt; &gt; date.
&gt;
&gt; Yes, that makes perfect sense.  But (c) supposing that there's no
&gt; tech breakthrough, you're gambling that the oil in the ground will
&gt; become significantly more valuable over time.  Right now, I think
&gt; that the Saudis or any other big investor can get quite a return
&gt; on their profits, perhaps 5-8% or more, intelligently invested in
&gt; the right places.
&gt;
&gt; The only reason I personally understand, then, to leave it in the
&gt; ground is that you don't have very much of it.  An oil company
&gt; that projected that its reserves would run out in a decade or so
&gt; might well be better off to forego investing in new equipment, and
&gt; continue to extract the oil with its present machinery.  But the
&gt; *big* oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela,
&gt; and Mexico won't be running out of oil until the whole world does,
&gt; and that's not in the foreseeable future.  (The need of money *now*
&gt; in these regimes would---it still seems to me---overpower long
&gt; term benefit anyway even if it existed.)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Leaving all the profits to Iraq?  That's not how
&gt; &gt; &gt; markets work.  Unless they achieve a cartel, it
&gt; &gt; &gt; forces down the world market price of oil, right?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; But this *is* what some producers have done in the past
&gt; &gt; particularly the Saudis.  You forgo profits in the short
&gt; &gt; term (let them accrue to whoever controls Iraq) in the
&gt; &gt; expectation that the income your resource will generate
&gt; &gt; in the future will be greater than it would otherwise be.
&gt;
&gt; I thought that they did this only when their cartel was
&gt; working.  No?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; An important consideration here is the time horizon of
&gt; &gt; the Saudi rulers.  If they think they are going to be
&gt; &gt; overthrown in the near future they have every reason
&gt; &gt; to cash in their chips now but if they are confident
&gt; &gt; of holding on the incentives work the other way.
&gt;
&gt; When you say &quot;cash in their chips now&quot;, do you believe
&gt; that they are afraid of running out?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't you acknowledge that the Saudis and everyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; else are trying to make as much money as they can?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes but when - within what time horizon?
&gt;
&gt; That's what makes this a difficult but interesting
&gt; discussion :-)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Lee concludes
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why, no.  Of course they'll have to change their behavior.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They'll either have to lower their price or sell less.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not at all. There's a third option (although you could say it's another
&gt; &gt; version of the second). The factor that might well make the Saudis behave
&gt; &gt; the way you predict lee, is the demographics they face. They have a lot
&gt; &gt; of overqualified young men and not enough jobs for them (jobs they are
&gt; &gt; keen on that is) so a decline in oil income has sever political
&gt; &gt; implications for them.
&gt;
&gt; Sure, a short time horizon, especially for countries less
&gt; stable, could indeed (one would think!) cause an increase
&gt; in production.  That it's not happening in some places,
&gt; e.g., Venezuela, is quite bizarre, but shows, I guess, the
&gt; inevitable political component.
&gt;
&gt; But what you wrote here---the &quot;third option&quot;---I don't follow.
&gt; In my simple minded picture, I suppose that a Western-run Iraq
&gt; might within five years or so be producing significantly more
&gt; oil.  So the world-wide price must fall.  Therefore, the Saudis
&gt; or anyone else must either obtain drastically less revenue or
&gt; raise production themselves.  Doesn't this seem right?
