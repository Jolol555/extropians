Hal writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From the rhetorical perspective, moving to questions of coercion hurts the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of discussion.  People become defensive and accusatory.  Some are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afraid their rights will be taken away by force.  Others are worried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they will be compelled to allow criminal injustice to go unanswered.
</em><br>
<p>A novel idea!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would encourage people to step back from the question of what should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed and to try to focus the discourse on questions of what personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions we would choose in various circumstances.  Life is not easy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are many hard questions facing all of us.
</em><br>
<p>I'm game.  (For a while, at least  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Building up the positions and arguments given by others should happen as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often as tearing them down.  People should present arguments on both sides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of every issue!
</em><br>
<p>I think you are positively dreaming here---but I would be
<br>
very happy to be wrong.  I'll will follow suit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would encourage debaters to write a posting making the best arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can for the position in some dispute which they think is weaker.  Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as a test of your intellectual integrity and argumentative abilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't undercut your posting by saying that you don't really believe it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because that is your ideology riding you.  It is kicking in the spurs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and tightening the leash around your neck, afraid you might escape its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mastery.  Make the arguments be true and honest and consistent.  You don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have any need to apologize for speaking the truth, even if you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that on balance there are opposing arguments that are more persuasive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyone who participated in competitive debate in school knows that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be able to argue both sides equally well.  It is a good exercise for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing issues clearly, uncontaminated by ego and ideology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<p>Quite interesting.
