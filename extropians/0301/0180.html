</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Hello my name is Lee Corbin.  Yes I am an integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but my pattern is that of a real person existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on Earth 2003 AD.  I am less than a googol long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but still as you will see there is no doubt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am he.  I have his DNA, his memories, his beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and personality dispositions.  Consult the weighty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; table of contents directly following...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If human code were capable to run all the variations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human combinations what would that solve?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously you would have to define all the combinations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humans as &quot;All genetic and environmental factors which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause the human code to change&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>You are speaking here of identity over time, and yes,
<br>
you are correct in that another class of integers is
<br>
indicated by the particular one above: we might write
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I(t+1) = I(t, environmental-input)
<br>
<p>However, this is a multi-valued function in that a
<br>
very large number of integers must be interpreted
<br>
as unambiguously meaning me a second later.
<br>
<p>Anyway, that's what I think you're getting to when you write
<br>
&quot;cause the human code to change&quot;.  I don't understand how
<br>
this applies to more than one person at a time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, all the humans would have the same code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without these factors.
</em><br>
<p>How do you understand a human being to be without these
<br>
factors?  Doesn't &quot;environment+heredity&quot; cover it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the combinations were to have new [non-human] genes and new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traits they would be inhuman.  Or if the combinations would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in a new environment and get new stimuli they would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhuman.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So a certain set of factors has to be established to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define the non-existing human combinations.  Wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these combinations change as the alive humans change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they have different genes and have different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments?
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, because what we would consider human would
<br>
and perhaps will change over time.  At one point, humans
<br>
that didn't have the right skin color weren't considered
<br>
human.
<br>
<p>But for the purposes of this discussion, I think that it
<br>
would be best to keep a fixed meaning of the term &quot;human&quot;,
<br>
and so the &quot;non-human&quot; (alien or animal) concept also
<br>
remains fixed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer is the human code can only be defined in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present, for a second later it has changed.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as I say, (a) the human code---by which I mean the
<br>
fuzzy set of all bit strings that represent human beings
<br>
---relies entirely on its genetic and environmental
<br>
factors, and (b) we ought not to consider those to be
<br>
undergoing any great change over the course of our
<br>
discussion in comparison to the enormous amount of 
<br>
information already therein.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What mathematical formula could we use to define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the changing human code?
</em><br>
<p>The formula I gave above for a single individual could
<br>
perhaps be extended to cover all humans at time t, and
<br>
perhaps you'd like to do so, obtaining your &quot;changing
<br>
human condition&quot; over time as a result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Being human is it possible for our code to predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future and then predict ourselves?
</em><br>
<p>While these are technically computable functions, they
<br>
are not computable in practice.  It would turn out that
<br>
super-human machinery would be necessary for the 
<br>
computation, and I also think that it is likely this
<br>
is one of those cases where we would implicitly
<br>
experience the calculation.  E.g., if it predicts
<br>
the 22nd century from the present data, then human
<br>
civilization will experience it just the same as we
<br>
are doing anyway, or we might already be that computation.
