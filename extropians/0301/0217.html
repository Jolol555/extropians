<em>&gt;From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Consistency,%20rhetoric,%20etc.,%20was%20Re:%20Terror%20and%20pity">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt;Subject: RE: Consistency, rhetoric, etc., was Re: Terror and pity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Damien paraphrases my remarks about cattle by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;substitution of the term &quot;the Irish&quot;. You sons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and daughters of Eire out there can tell him what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you think of this.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think the implication in your statement says it better than we 
<br>
could :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The Irish are better off being bred and slaughtered than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they would be if the British didn't bother raising them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask only that they be treated well before they're killed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and the killing be done as painlessly as possible. It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; be a sad day for the Irish race when people no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; want to eat them.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have always clearly maintained that people are to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be accorded special status. Besides, your implied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history would be screwed up. The British never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;raised&quot; the Irish, they merely conquered them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and began denying them their freedom.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure Damien's aware of that.  Besides, even if they had, they'd have 
<br>
realised they screwed up royally and chucked us all into the sea :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But let's suppose that your history were accurate, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the British had given birth to the Irish race for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the express purpose of eating them. Now we would agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it would have been better for the British to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply created the Irish with no strings attached.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Absolutely true. Fine. That's granted.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But suppose we ask of a certain Terrence O'Reilly:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the whole, taken as a package, was it good or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bad for you that this happened?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You see the logic of my argument. It is not rocket
</em><br>
<em>&gt;science. What is it about it that bothers you so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Besides that it &quot;smacks&quot; of this or that.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can there not be a logical argument that supports
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your point of view with respect to a real, particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person? Or must your feelings and intuitions remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logically unarticulated? And you're not alone; I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sure that there are millions who believe just as you do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lee
</em><br>
<p>&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
