</em><br>
<p>Clearly ExI has principles (at least of a sort) - The Extropian
<br>
Principles.
<br>
<p>Take this quote from the front page:
<br>
<p>&quot;Extropianism is a transhumanist philosophy. The Extropian
<br>
Principles define a specific version or &quot;brand&quot; of transhumanist
<br>
thinking. Like humanists, transhumanists favor (sic) reason,
<br>
progress, and values centred on our well being rather than on an
<br>
external religious authority.&quot;
<br>
<p>Favor. Not choose. As I've said elsewhere reasoning and believing
<br>
are mutually exclusive in the same head on the same issue at the
<br>
same time. A choice has to be made. To not chose is a choice.
<br>
<p>I'm not really sure a person can be just a little bit superstitious. I
<br>
don't know.
<br>
<p>I wonder if the Extropian Principles are trying to having a bit of a
<br>
bet each way. They want to appeal to the broadest possible range
<br>
of people (which is good) and so not be inaccessible to anybody
<br>
(which is also good in principle but in practice such an approach
<br>
can dumb a philosophy down moving a group forward for harmony's
<br>
sake at the rate that is comfortable to the least capable of the
<br>
group).  The desire to be inclusive and not leave anybody out is
<br>
laudable. But some people will opt out of sharing in the extropian
<br>
'philosophy' and principles anyway and of their own choice.
<br>
<p>I've picked out only one word &quot;favor&quot; but I think I could work
<br>
my way through the principles pointing out that the desire to
<br>
be inclusive, to leave no human being that wants to come
<br>
behind is a big part of them - a desire which I share, but a
<br>
desire which I suspect cannot be realised without dropping
<br>
the rate of change to that which the slowest can cope with. Because
<br>
the slowest will most likely be those who retain superstitions as
<br>
substantial aspects of their worldview yet are attracted to
<br>
aspects of extropianism as a bit of an each way bet. The mindset
<br>
I am referring too wants this life to last as long as possible and be
<br>
as good as possible but they then hope to get to an afterlife if they
<br>
need it as well. The neo-Pascal's wagerers.
<br>
<p>Does ExI have a position as a lobby group?
<br>
<p>I'm not really sure. Again I'm writing from Australia so I may be
<br>
misunderstanding or not seeing certain things. My exposure to ExI is
<br>
pretty much limited to the list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I interpreted Natasha's statements as saying in particular that Exi
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  has no political affiliations. eg: it has no association with any formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Libertarian groups.
</em><br>
<p>I understand that to be the case too, but there are at least two &quot;forms&quot;
<br>
of politics. The one that most people think of may be the Democrats
<br>
vs Republicans (in the US).
<br>
<p>But my point is that whenever people gather especially when decisions
<br>
need to be made about priorities and allocating resources there is politics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, even though many Extropians might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian, or social democrat, or conservative, these leanings are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orthogonal to being Extropian, and Exi in turn has no bias in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political dimension, as it does not involve itself in such.
</em><br>
<p>By the political dimension I'm reading its neither for or against
<br>
particular political parties that specifically seek government such
<br>
as the Democracts and Republicans. I don't think it should by
<br>
in that sort of politic either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This doesn't mean that it couldn't talk about having political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents, couldn't lobby political groups, or otherwise engage in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the political landscape in representing Extropy. It's just that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a political party in and of itself, and doesn't desire to be.
</em><br>
<p>Having gone through Natasha's Pro-Act presentation, I can now
<br>
see that some thought has been given to competitors in the meme-
<br>
scape.
<br>
<p>I still thing that the questions I raised run orthogonal to these
<br>
points though.
<br>
<p>(I've never heard the word orthogonal used so often as it is in
<br>
&nbsp;extropic circles - it seems even single word memes are
<br>
contagious)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I could be wrong. :-)
</em><br>
<p>Just don't go thinking you've got an exclusive on that terrain :-)
<br>
