<p>Considering that the Soviets had some interesting ground based directed

energy weapons in the 1980s (they just couldn't get them into space), I
<br>
believe that they did believe it would work, but also that they
<br>
believed they couldn't afford it.

<p>What he means, John, is that we should stop burning gasoline in our
<br>
cars, i.e. we should sacrifice our economy on the altar of pacifism to
<br>
beat the muslims via Gandhi-like non-violence (they are forgetting, of
<br>
course, that it was a Muslim who killed Gandhi).
<br>
<p>In retort, I will once again on this list quote George Orwell, who said
<br>
&quot;Pacifists are objectively pro-fascist&quot; By opposing the warmaking of
<br>
free nations against tyranny, &quot;they aid and abet the fascist enemy&quot;.
