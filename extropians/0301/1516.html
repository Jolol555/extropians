<em>&gt; Having *no* fat reserves means your circulating glucose and

<p>Extended Longevity in Mice Lacking the Insulin Receptor in Adipose

<br>
<p>Caloric restriction has been shown to increase longevity in organisms
<br>
ranging from yeast to mammals. In some organisms, this has been
<br>
associated with a decreased fat mass and alterations in
<br>
insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathways. To further
<br>
explore these associations with enhanced longevity, we studied mice
<br>
with a fat-specific insulin receptor knockout (FIRKO). These animals
<br>
have reduced fat mass and are protected against age-related obesity
<br>
and its subsequent metabolic abnormalities, although their food intake
<br>
is normal. Both male and female FIRKO mice were found to have an
<br>
increase in mean life-span of ~134 days (18%), with parallel increases
<br>
in median and maximum life-spans. Thus, a reduction of fat mass
<br>
without caloric restriction can be associated with increased longevity
<br>
in mice, possibly through effects on insulin signaling.

<br>
----------
<br>
Longevity is dependent on many factors including genetics (1, 2),
<br>
hormonal and growth factor signaling (3, 4), body weight (5), body fat
<br>
content, and environmental factors (4, 6). Food restriction is the
<br>
most potent environmental variable and has been shown to increase
<br>
longevity in diverse organisms (6). The effect of restricted feeding
<br>
on life-span has been studied in rodents for more than 60 years
<br>
(7-10), and although some studies have suggested that reduced food
<br>
intake is more important than adiposity (8, 9), it is difficult to
<br>
separate the beneficial effect of caloric restriction from that of
<br>
leanness and the various biochemical correlates of leanness. 
<br>
To investigate this question, we evaluated the life-span of the
<br>
fat-specific insulin receptor knockout (FIRKO) mouse. These animals
<br>
were derived by crossing insulin receptor IR (lox/+) mice, in which
<br>
exon 4 of the insulin receptor is flanked by loxP sites (11), with IR
<br>
(lox/+) mice that also express the Cre recombinase under the control
<br>
of the aP2 promoter/enhancer (12). This breeding strategy also
<br>
generated three littermate control groups: wild-type (WT), IR
<br>
(lox/lox), and aP2-Cre mice, which were indistinguishable with regard
<br>
to physiologic and metabolic parameters and have the same mixed
<br>
genetic background as the FIRKO mice. For the aging experiments, 250
<br>
animals were housed under the same conditions in a virus-free facility
<br>
on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and were given a standard rodent feed
<br>
and water ad libitum. 
<br>
<p>Growth curves were normal in male and female FIRKO mice from birth to
<br>
8 weeks of age. Starting at 3 months of age, FIRKO mice maintained 15
<br>
to 25% lower body weights and a 50 to 70% reduction in fat mass
<br>
throughout life (Fig. 1A). The reduction in adiposity was estimated by
<br>
perigonadal fat pad weight but was apparent in all fat depots and was
<br>
also reflected by a reduction of ~25% in total-body triglyceride
<br>
content (13). FIRKO mice are healthy, lack any of the metabolic
<br>
abnormalities associated with lipodystrophy, and are protected against
<br>
age-related deterioration in glucose tolerance, which is observed in
<br>
all control strains (13). FIRKO mice maintained low body fat, despite
<br>
normal food intake (Fig. 1B). Indeed, because FIRKO mice were leaner,
<br>
the food intake of FIRKO mice expressed per gram of body weight
<br>
actually exceeded that of controls by an average of 55% (Fig. 1C).

<br>
food intake (B), and food intake per gram body weight in FIRKO mice
<br>
(C) (initial cohort, n = 40) and control littermates (initial cohort,
<br>
n = 20 per genotype). (A) We determined fat pad mass in animals killed
<br>
at each age by directly weighing perigonadal fat pads. There was no
<br>
difference in body weight or fat pad mass among the three control
<br>
genotypes [WT, IR (lox/lox), and aP2-Cre]. After the mice reached the
<br>
age of 3 months, the differences in fat pad mass per gram of body
<br>
weight were significant for all data points between FIRKO mice
<br>
(diamonds) and all three controls (squares) (P &lt; 0.05). (B) In mice
<br>
caged singly, we determined food intake (gram per mouse per day) daily
<br>
over 5 days by using at least five FIRKO (white bars) and four control
<br>
mice (black bars) per genotype (n = 12). Data of the control genotypes
<br>
[WT, IR (lox/lox), and aP2-Cre] are plotted together in the black
<br>
bars, because there were no differences in daily food intake among
<br>
them. (C) Food intake per gram body weight--calculated from the food
<br>
intake and body weight data--was significantly increased in FIRKO mice
<br>
(white bars) as compared with controls (black bars) (P &lt; 0.05). [View

<br>
<p><p>The median life-span of most laboratory mice, such as BALB/c-nu (5) or
<br>
C57BL/6J (14), is 30 months. Consistent with this, we found that 45 to
<br>
54% of the mice in the control groups lived to 30 months of age. By
<br>
contrast, about 80% of the FIRKO mice were alive at this age (Fig.
<br>
2A). The increased survival of FIRKO mice was seen in both males and
<br>
females and was confirmed in two independent lines of mice. Complete
<br>
survival curves revealed that the mean life-span was increased by 134
<br>
days (from 753 to 887) or 18% (Fig. 2B). The median life-span in FIRKO
<br>
mice was also increased by 3.5 months (from 30 ± 0.6 months to 33.5
<br>
months), and the maximum life-span was extended by ~5 months. At 36
<br>
months, all mice in the control groups had died, whereas ~25% of the
<br>
FIRKO mice were still alive. The longest lived FIRKO mice died at the
<br>
age of 41 months. Further analysis of the survival plots (Fig. 2B)
<br>
with previously described mathematical models (15) revealed that
<br>
extended longevity in FIRKO mice is associated with both a shift in
<br>
the age at which the &quot;age-dependent increase in mortality risk&quot;
<br>
becomes appreciable and a decreased rate of age-related mortality,
<br>
especially after 36 months of age.

analysis, the fraction of mice alive at 30 months from founder line 1
<br>
[WT (n = 34), IR (lox/lox) (n = 35), aP2-Cre (n = 30), and FIRKO (n =

<br>
also pooled, because they were similar in each of the groups. **P &lt;

0.05. (B) Pooled survival curves for FIRKO mice derived from two
<br>
different aP2-Cre founder lines. We performed pair-wise comparisons
<br>
among genotypes for age-specific survival by log-rank test with
<br>
significance corrected for multiple tests. Median life-span in line 1
<br>
(n = 131) was FIRKO, 33.5 months; WT, 30.3 months; IR (lox/lox), 28.7
<br>
months; and aP2-Cre, 30.7 months. Among the control groups WT, IR
<br>
(lox/lox), and aP2-Cre, survival did not differ (P = 0.31), whereas
<br>
survival of FIRKO mice was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.001). Median
<br>
life-span in line 2 (n = 119) was FIRKO, 33.4 months; WT, 29.8 months;
<br>
IR (lox/lox), 30.1 months; and aP2-Cre, 29.9 months. The maximum
<br>
longevity (average life-span of the 10% longest lived mice) was
<br>
significantly increased from 34.7 months in the controls to 39.5
<br>
months in FIRKO mice (P &lt; 0.001). Among the control groups WT, IR
<br>
(lox/lox), and aP2-Cre, maximum life-span did not differ (P = 0.62).

----------
<br>
<p><p>The FIRKO mouse demonstrates the beneficial effects of reduced
<br>
adiposity on the extension of life-span in a setting where food intake
<br>
is normal or even increased relative to body weight. Caloric
<br>
restriction has been hypothesized to delay aging by decreasing
<br>
metabolism and the associated production of damaging oxygen free
<br>
radicals (16-19). In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (20) and the
<br>
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (21), slowing down mitochondrial
<br>
metabolism and metabolic rate appears to extend life expectancy.
<br>
However, in rodents, caloric restriction appears to extend life-span
<br>
without decreasing the metabolic rate (22, 23). In FIRKO mice, the
<br>
resistance to obesity, despite normal food intake, suggests that
<br>
metabolic rate is increased, rather than decreased (13). If free
<br>
radical damage is the important factor, then in the FIRKO mouse this
<br>
must be derived directly or indirectly from the decreased fat mass
<br>
rather than the diet. Another possibility is that the increased
<br>
longevity in FIRKO mice is the direct result of altered insulin
<br>
signaling. Mutations that reduce signaling through the insulin-like
<br>
signaling pathway can increase life expectancy in C. elegans (24-26)
<br>
and in Drosophila (27, 28), and these longevity mutations can be
<br>
reversed in some cases by additional activating mutations in the
<br>
insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. In both of these species, reduced
<br>
insulin-like signaling can extend life-span by 50% or more (20, 27,
<br>
28). 
<br>
<p>Although decreased insulin-like signaling appears to increase life
<br>
expectancy in invertebrates, whether the same is true in mammals or
<br>
humans is unclear. At least three genes have been identified (Pit1dw,
<br>
Prop1df, Ghr) in which loss-of-function mutations lead to dwarfism
<br>
with reduced levels of IGF-1 and insulin. These are associated with
<br>
increased longevity in mice (3, 4). On the other hand,
<br>
loss-of-function mutations in the insulin receptor, which lead to
<br>
severe insulin resistance (29-31), or even milder forms of insulin
<br>
resistance associated with diabetes and obesity (32, 33), result in
<br>
shortened life-span in both humans and mice. FIRKO mice have a
<br>
selective loss of insulin signaling in adipose tissue only, and this
<br>
is not associated with diabetes or glucose intolerance. Moreover,
<br>
FIRKO mice have normal to somewhat supernormal glucose tolerance and,
<br>
thus, may in some ways mimic caloric restriction, which is known to
<br>
extend life-span in rodents (10). Indeed, the phenotype of aging FIRKO
<br>
mice shows similarities with the phenotype of food-restricted mice,
<br>
such as reduced adiposity, trend to lower insulin levels, and
<br>
protection from decreased insulin sensitivity (13).
<br>
<p>In summary, the results of our studies with FIRKO mice are consistent
<br>
with the view that leanness, not food restriction, is a key
<br>
contributor to extended longevity. The exact mechanism underlying this
<br>
effect requires further analysis.
