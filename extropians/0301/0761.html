<em>&gt;-------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here are some comments I have...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;FLIR is an acronym that stands for Forward Looking Infra-Red. It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technology that uses far infra-red radiation for seeing without benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of visible light. Why it's necessary to add the words &quot;forward looking&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is not clear, except that IR is not very satisfying as acronyms go, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it's too much like a Spanish verb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My understanding is that FLIR is not an acronym for the technology, but for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the specific devices themselves--infrared viewing pods attached to aircraft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They're literally &quot;forward-looking infrared&quot; cameras, to allow the crew to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pick out details in the dark, so they can target weapons, gather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information, navigate in bad weather, etc.
</em><br>
<p>This is correct. FLIR is an acronym borrowed from the military, where
<br>
an infra-red sensor is mounted either in a pod or in the nose of an
<br>
aircraft and is used to image the field of view immediately in front
<br>
of the aircraft (the &quot;forward looking&quot; bit). So-called &quot;FLIR&quot;
<br>
installations mounted on police helicopters are not specifically
<br>
&quot;FLIR&quot; at all, but &quot;steerable IR&quot; sensors. To confuse things even
<br>
more, they are sometimes referred to as &quot;FLIR Radars&quot;, when they're
<br>
not even radars either, which is entirely different (are you out there
<br>
and taking note, Sheriff John Bunnell??!). 
<br>
<p>Radar emits narrow beams of radio energy which are reflected off objects 
<br>
in the field-of-view and detected by a receiving antenna. Actually, 
<br>
&quot;reflected&quot; is not quite the true story, either, but I'll let that pass.
<br>
<p>IR sensing is usually entirely passive - the IR detector only senses
<br>
IR radiation, it doesn't emit it, like using a flashlamp or a radar to 
<br>
illuminate a field of view, though IR floodlights do exist (these act as
<br>
&quot;stealthy floodlights&quot;, because if you don't have an IR sensor then
<br>
you can'see it). This is complicated to achieve and is not used very often.
<br>
<p>IR is more correctly called &quot;Thermal Imaging&quot; (TI). This is the TI in
<br>
the acronym TIALD (Thermal Imaging and Laser Designation), which is an
<br>
integrated weapon aiming system that uses a thermal imager to view a scene
<br>
and detect targets, and a laser designator for so-called &quot;smart&quot; (terminally
<br>
guided) weapons (bombs or missiles). TIALDs are usually fitted to aircraft
<br>
in the form of an externally-mounted pod which contains a steerable turret
<br>
containing the TI sensor and the laser designator. Civilian police imaging 
<br>
systems have borrowed this concept by having a steerable spherical turret
<br>
with windows in it though which the sensors view the outside world. The turret
<br>
usually also contains (or is slaved to) a powerful floodlight (&quot;Night Sun&quot;,
<br>
for example.
<br>
<p>The other &quot;see in the dark&quot; system is the Image Intensifier (II). This is 
<br>
another entirely passive system, which takes available light (including a 
<br>
small amount of infra red) and amplifies it several hundred times using a 
<br>
device caled a photomultiplier. 
<br>
<p>Again, TV and film have mangled the technology. Most &quot;thermal goggles&quot; you 
<br>
see in the movies are actually image intensifiers, which do not function in 
<br>
daylight (you can damage the photomultipliers by exposing them to bright 
<br>
light).
<br>
<p>IIs do not function in total darkness, but do work in extremely low light
<br>
conditions (&quot;cloud covered starlight&quot; is the usually quoted lower limit
<br>
to their performance).
<br>
<p>Both systems have advantages and disadvantages - TIs work in total
<br>
darkness, but don't resolve fine images. IIs show shadows and fine detail 
<br>
such as power lines and vehicle tracks, but are overloaded by bright lights, 
<br>
and so on. Where TIs are bulky and require weighty cooling equipment, IIs
<br>
are light and compact, often being the size of a pair of field glasses.
<br>
<p>More sophisticated systems combine the two (a technique called &quot;image fusion&quot;), 
<br>
with high-speed software to take the best bits of both systems to synthesise 
<br>
a higher quality image. Image fusion can also combine data from other sensors, 
<br>
including radar and visible-light cameras, and could feasibly include Ladar 
<br>
(laser, that is, optical wavelength radar), sonar and so on.
<br>
<p>TI's main use is to look for targets. Engines, exhausts and tyres on
<br>
vehicles that have recently been in motion show up as bright, hot spots
<br>
against the darkness of the cooler surrounding terrain. TI can (and is)
<br>
used during daylight as well as at night. TIs can spot artificial camouflage
<br>
against natural foliage, and can even see the difference between camouflage 
<br>
improvised from foliage because cut and dying greenery has different thermal 
<br>
properties to undamaged trees and bushes. 
<br>
<p>IIs are only used at night or in darkened building interiors. Their main
<br>
use is to aid a pilot in seeing the view outside the cockpit. Because IIs 
<br>
are light and robust, they can be worn by individual troops moving and 
<br>
fighting at night, and can be incorporated into gunsights.
<br>
<p>IIs are not especially effective in poor weather, since they only apmplify
<br>
the available light. TIs are marginally better, but not much. Poor weather
<br>
is still the major factor in reducing the availability of aircraft to
<br>
assist other troops.
