<em>&gt; Kai,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You can't even keep 80 German companies from breaking the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dealing with Sadaam to help him develop WMDs and you think you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this.
</em><br>
<p>In case you refer to the link in &quot;memoryhole&quot; and the list in 
<br>
Tageszeitung, this list contains deals back from the 70s to today. This 
<br>
includes the era where the West supported Saddam against the former top 
<br>
enemy of the free world, the Ayatollahs in Iran. If you happen to find 
<br>
this list of 80 companies, I'll be happy to investigate what's the actual 
<br>
status. From what I know, several illegal deals of german companies (ca. 
<br>
6-10) have been uncovered by german and other european authorities during 
<br>
the last years and several perpetrators have been convicted. I have no 
<br>
evidence that there are no more illegal activities, but I have also no 
<br>
evidence that any authorities in Germany (or the US) are backing such.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are making the first mistake that every socialist starts with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;first totally change human nature. Second, change the laws and think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will solve the problem.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That's not what I said. I only say: You cannot demand from others what 
<br>
you are not willing to give yourself. If lawfulness and human rights are 
<br>
the most important principles of our societies, we have to observe them 
<br>
ourselfs or we will lose them completely. That is, btw, the fundament of 
<br>
every democratic society, beginning from 1776. Equal law and justice for 
<br>
everyone. Not individual might defines the course of action, but common 
<br>
agreements. So consider the UN security council a court of justice and 
<br>
the members to be the jury. That's the way, a law-abiding society works.
<br>
<p>If one nations breaks out of this system, there are two choices. The 
<br>
other nations will either collectively convince or force him back, or the 
<br>
whole system will crash and politics will fall back into stone-age.
<br>
<p>The key word here is collectively. If the Iraq has broken the UN 
<br>
resolutions and really has ABC weapons, there has to be an adequate 
<br>
response. If the Iraq refuses to work with the UN or to give out those 
<br>
weapons even a military action might be necessary. But only if the UN SC 
<br>
decides so, based on the evidence given.
<br>
<p>Should the US itself start a war without legitimation from the UN, it 
<br>
will open the door for every other country to behave at will. And don't 
<br>
think that damaging the power of the UN will be any good for the US, 
<br>
because this will make dealing with more Iraq-like cases more difficult. 
<br>
Even the US cannot handle all possible conflicts be themselfes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Your plan might have some validity if it didn't depend on our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standing quietly by and being murdered while you plan took centuries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.
</em><br>
<p>Where did I say so? I once again dare to ask, where the &quot;clear and 
<br>
present danger&quot; is, Mr. Bush is talking about. No weapons found yet. No 
<br>
attack plans. No connections with Al-Qaida. No military might worth 
<br>
speaking of. No political, no financial, no technological and no 
<br>
strategic power. A 23mio., almost 3rd world country after a decade of 
<br>
embargo shall be the top enemy of the single super power of this planet? 
<br>
Do you really believe that? Do you really believe, we don't have the time 
<br>
for patience and wise, long lasting decisions?
<br>
<p>Or are there other interests to start a war just now? Time is running out 
<br>
- for Mr. Bush. A desert war in Iraq is only possible in spring time. If 
<br>
he can't start now, he'll have to keep the crisis cooking for 6-8 more 
<br>
months, where internal themes like the world and US economy have good 
<br>
chances to win over it. Six to eight more months also mean that more and 
<br>
more people begin to think about costs and consequences. And then there's 
<br>
the upcoming election in 2004. A war in late 2003 and early 2004 would 
<br>
bear a high risk of bringing the costs and consequences into the debate. 
<br>
More than 50% of the US people are already against a war.
<br>
<p>The only chance for Bush is to figh a quick and succesful war just now or 
<br>
risk to lose a substancial amount of votes.
<br>
