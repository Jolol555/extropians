Brett had written (Friday, Jan 10, 12:54 AM)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [A] &quot;I believe (sic) that life (sic) begins at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; conception.  I believe that any other points we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; might choose are essentially arbitrary and uncertain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And I believe that this is a view founded not in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; religion, not in faith, but on the logic of the matter. ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But wouldn't it have meant exactly the same thing if he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had said, [B] &quot;My working hypothesis is that human existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; begins at conception, and I contend that this is a view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; founded not in religion, not in faith, but on logic.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think so at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The proposition I am putting to you Lee is that there is a larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue here than the mere ontological point.  If we call the guy who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made the original unmodified statement Tony-A and the one who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made the modified statement Tony-B would you really have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference over whether Tony-A or Tony-B was casting a vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on stem cell policy that was likely to directly effect the rate at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which treatments for a variety of diseases might be found and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultimately cures might be found?.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I would prefer to vote for [B] because his choice
<br>
of words does, as has been pointed out, make it sound like
<br>
he's less committed.  Also, there is a chance that you are
<br>
right about this individual, and what he means by &quot;I believe&quot;
<br>
is not &quot;I think&quot;, but &quot;I BELIEVE&quot;.  
<br>
<p>But I might vote for [A] instead because the ideological
<br>
positions displayed are *exactly* the same, and [A] is more 
<br>
up-front about it.
<br>
<p>It's just a little too bizarre that my approval would
<br>
simply be a function of the particular words chosen.
<br>
<p>(There is a notable exception to this:  ideological
<br>
positions can be and often are intentionally betrayed
<br>
by word choice, i.e., I would vote against someone
<br>
who employed a lot of Marxist jargon but who was 
<br>
saying exactly the same thing as someone who said
<br>
&quot;Western manufacturing managers should become less
<br>
addicted to assembly-line solutions.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; They start from a position of faith or belief assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that as an axiom and reason from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But I .....start from the axiom &quot;suffering is bad&quot; (that's me!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think the infant Lee Corbin came into the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loaded with many &quot;axioms&quot; at all.  I also think that by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time you learnt what the word axiom meant your thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have developed way past the point where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have thought suffering is bad in every case. I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think there is an *actual* as opposed to a theoretical or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical state in which you do, or ever did, &quot;*start*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the axiom 'suffering is bad'&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Your remarks about the infant Lee Corbin are pretty
<br>
unnecessary.  OF COURSE one does not *start* in the
<br>
way you describe.  Not even in geometry!!  You could
<br>
try to read what is written a little more charitably?  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now yes, in general, I'm with you and I *do* have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem with axiomatic schemes.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what respect are you *with me*?  What do you take to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my main contention in this thread (that you are with me on)?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think that you were criticizing those who
<br>
&quot;start&quot; from a position of faith or belief in 
<br>
justifying their conclusions, as you wrote above.
<br>
<p>But by your use of the word &quot;axiom&quot; I also inferred,
<br>
perhaps incorrectly, that you also had a problem, like
<br>
I do, with those who would try to rigorously deduce
<br>
from some small set of principles everything they
<br>
believe---sorry---everything that they endorse.  It's
<br>
not your &quot;main contention&quot;, of course.
<br>
<p>My confession of &quot;suffering is bad&quot; as being sort of
<br>
axiomatic is only that this is a meme up against which
<br>
my thoughts frequently bump.  It's sort of a &quot;hard
<br>
principle&quot;.  But I've always had better sense than
<br>
to begin a Euclidean program on it!
<br>
<p>Lee
