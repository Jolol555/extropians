<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin sets up a test as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brett Paatsch claims that the two extended statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A.  &quot;I believe that life begins at conception.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     that any other points we might choose are essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     arbitrary and uncertain.  And I believe that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     a view founded not in religion, not in faith, but on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     the logic of the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; B.  &quot;My working hypothesis is that human existence begins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     at conception, and I contend that this is a view founded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     not in religion, not in faith, but on logic.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not equivalent.  I claim that they *are* equivalent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who is correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good idea to put the proposition to a test in this way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee.  Your quite right, we should be able to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirically whether extropians as a whole perceive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a difference between A and B. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, obviously there are differences.  The question is
<br>
what are they, and how significant are they.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Eliezer pointed out, B, as set up, is missing a sentence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or A has an extra one), so that confounds the test a little.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, not at all.  That sentence is IMO completely redundant.
<br>
That the other dividing points between human and non-human
<br>
are &quot;essentially arbitrary and uncertain&quot; follows from the
<br>
guy's claim that his view is based on logic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also its possible that by putting names on the options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there might be subtle &quot;allegiance effects&quot; that have little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the question being tested. I hope not, but its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not impossible, so I'd have preferred the propositions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not potentially confound a choice involving support or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition of either one of our views.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you're right.  I'm in favor of openness almost instinctively,
<br>
but this is a case where the names may have hurt (or could have
<br>
hurt).  Never underestimate the unconscious power of ideology,
<br>
even on top of the way &quot;having a judicial temperament&quot; is beyond
<br>
most people capabilities (or desires).   But I also confess to
<br>
some annoyance with you, and unkindly strove in pique to expose
<br>
your fallacy to the world at your expense :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's possible that some people would not want to &quot;dump on&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less favored proposition in deference to whoever happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be holding it and so may not &quot;vote&quot; or express an opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sure both you and I would not mind (well not much :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not everyone would know that we have such healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ego ;-) and some might be &quot;gentle&quot; on us. 
</em><br>
<p>Alas.  Yes.  It could happen, even if you were to state
<br>
an arithmetic problem and attach people's names, I guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would argue that *if* a difference is perceived and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people see the variant without belief as more open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further discussion then I've made much but not all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case I need to make to get some extropes to voluntarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give up reinforcing the believing meme (which competes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head to head with the more sociable reasoning meme) by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using it. 
</em><br>
<p>Efforts to change other people's verbal habits are, IMO,
<br>
doomed.  One is already *very* lucky if he makes progress
<br>
in changing someone's ontology, though usually even that
<br>
can only happen unconsciously in the target after months
<br>
or years of unconscious processing.
<br>
<p>(Example:  Jeff Davis asserts that the &quot;American Holocaust&quot;
<br>
is in full swing now, as is as bad as any other one of the
<br>
20th century.  Since he has planted this idea in our minds,
<br>
the *best* possible outcome for him is for some of us to
<br>
admit years from now that the Americans have directly or
<br>
indirectly been responsible for as many megadeaths as those
<br>
previous regimes, and this will occur when people have long
<br>
ago forgotten where they heard any accusation as &quot;American
<br>
Holocaust&quot;.)
<br>
<p>(Example:  I hope that people's verbal behavior will indeed
<br>
change from blithely throwing the word &quot;rights&quot; around, and
<br>
instead will either say that X approves (X may be a society)
<br>
or speak of &quot;legal rights&quot;.  But what I am after is completely
<br>
different than what you are after, I think.  I want to change
<br>
their belief about what exists, and then have their verbal
<br>
behavior change as a consequence of that.  You just want 'em
<br>
to drop the word and say &quot;I think&quot; instead of &quot;I believe&quot;
<br>
or something.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lots of other word memes and phrases could then be tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [like on a web site] including &quot;human life&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;human beings&quot; and we'd have a useful empirical tool easily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapted.
</em><br>
<p>This is what focus groups do for politicians.  The
<br>
campaign managers and PR specialists do try out
<br>
various phrases on focus groups to see what goes
<br>
over best.  I find it all abhorrent.  If one's position
<br>
has not really changed, i.e., actual judgments as to
<br>
the states of affairs, then just using different words
<br>
seems quite dishonest to me.
<br>
