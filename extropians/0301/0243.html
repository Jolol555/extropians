<p>Look, we're discussing what makes sense. We're not in the position to make 
<br>
policy, nor are we implementing policy. Whether ours or somebody elses.
<br>
<p>So perhaps we can skip the rhetoric, and talk about what makes sense.

The Matrix has me again, so I couldn't answer the other posts in that 
<br>
thread yet.

<p><em>&gt; The country I'm living in is physically larger than the

<em>&gt; Do you or do you not favor sending the police out into the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>To answer that question we must first figure out whether it's morally ok
<br>
for parents to deliberately produce a defective child. I've thought the
<br>
answer was easy, but it isn't. I have to figure out whether there is a
<br>
straightforward answer, or whether the answer is 'it depends on your frame
<br>
of reference'. (Actually, because different people seem to be having very 
<br>
different opinions on the issue it is likely to be the latter).
