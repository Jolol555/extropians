<p>
I myself am a bug chaser, especially since Damien made a
<br>
comment a few days ago that led me to some interesting
<br>
new insights.  He cited a study that contends that
<br>
mantises wings have evolved and de-evolved repeatedly,
<br>
calling into question some traditional notions about
<br>
pylogeny recapitulating ontogeny.
<br>
<p>I placed a roach hotel in the garden and managed to
<br>
apprehend a guest who checked in but did not check
<br>
out.  I removed the deceased cockroach and examined
<br>
him or her closely (are the females still called
<br>
cockroaches?) observing that under those big wings,
<br>
a roach looks a lot like a mantis.  One is drawn
<br>
into a grudging admiration of these wretched beasts
<br>
for what is actually a very elegant and efficient
<br>
configuration.
<br>
<p>The insight was that the wings are not primarily for
<br>
flying, an activity in which the cockroach seldom
<br>
participates.  The tough, waxy wings are good for
<br>
other purposes, such as allowing the roach to wiggle
<br>
into small cracks without hanging up.  Would not the
<br>
roach's wings also make him or her a less desireable
<br>
meal for birds?  I would think it would be like when
<br>
one takes a newby to sushi and they eat the entire
<br>
edamame, not realizing the tough outer hull is not
<br>
actually edible.  Birds might have a similarly
<br>
unpleasant experience attempting to devour a roach.
<br>
<p>Unlike many insect's strategy of conserving energy
<br>
with slothful ponderous movements, the cockroach
<br>
darts and scurries.  (Have you ever seen one calmly
<br>
walking?  No.)  The wings have their cost with this
<br>
lifestyle, as they do add weight.  I can imagine wings
<br>
in cockroaches could be right on the line between
<br>
advantageous and disadvantageous, depending on the
<br>
environmental circumstances.  It doesn't upset my
<br>
notions of how evolution works if they were to come
<br>
and go every few jillion generations.
<br>
<p>Even so, I do wish to avoid possible misunderstanding
<br>
of the term bug chaser.  Amateur ornithologists are
<br>
often called birders, so it seems natural that amateur
<br>
entomologists would be known as buggers, and their
<br>
avocation known as buggery.
