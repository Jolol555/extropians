<p>nanowave: I have no idea how you get &quot;objective&quot; as my suggested, or even adopted,
<br>
point of view. So the rest of your post is very hard for me to parse. You might look
<br>
to the seeming from your side.
<br>
<p>The very use of the word &quot;normal&quot; usually sounds to me like an attempt at objectivity.
<br>
Kindly note that I was not the person who proposed that term in the inequality--Lee did.
<br>
<p>The notion that every life is better than every nonlife seemd to be to me what
<br>
Lee was arguing for, and *that* sounded Procrustean and implied glittering-generality/
<br>
objectivity-ism/absolutism to me. &quot;Every sperm is sacred&quot;, but with the bar raised.
<br>
<p>In his reply to me, Lee seemed to corner sharply; he seems to think we have a lot we agree on.
<br>
I don't know where that leaves your thesis, but I was left by it at the gate anyway. :)
