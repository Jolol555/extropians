&lt;&lt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why did Rome still have troops throughout the rich Empire? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien Broderick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [surely it *can't* be that simple]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [no no no]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>My understanding of history is that Rome was a fairly, horrible empire that 
<br>
was great at building roads and organizing laws to further its interests. 
<br>
Rome essentially raided the Mediterranean basin; and thus, furthered the 
<br>
development of Christianity, by making life so economically bare for the 
<br>
indigenous people, that they sought refuge in religious fantasy.
<br>
<p>Nobody is suffering because the USA slurps all the goodies from them. Most 
<br>
countries seem to benefit by American economic dynamism, rather then suffer 
<br>
from it. My contention is that europe, especially, is too cheap to fend for 
<br>
themselves. If they had wanted out of the military aspects of NATO, the 
<br>
european governments could have done what Charles De Gaul did in 1966, and 
<br>
withdrew. So much the better.
