<p>
Alex,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you a different analysis on how events will play out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-we go through a slight rough patch with the war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-there are risks in the war.  The war is only justified by the 
<br>
risk of the war being less than the risk of not having the war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the leftists will act out and be a pain in the backside but in the 
<br>
end will do no more than identify themselves.  This will be handy, not for 
<br>
retaliation but for identification the next time they try their old label 
<br>
switcheroo to make a comeback.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mr. Bush will pass most of his economic plan which is basically a 
<br>
libertarian       plan and it will set up a long term growth trend.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The Supremes will rightfully knock down most of the laws over which 
<br>
we have civil liberties concerns.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mr. Bush hopefully will be able to bring more jobs back into the 
<br>
country and reverse the plan of turning us into a service economy.  Here, I 
<br>
am not concerned with his ability to do so but rather whether or not he is on 
<br>
top of the situation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The right wing will find its most serious competition politically at 
<br>
the elections from the libertarian side.  I am speaking of ideas not the 
<br>
Libertarian Party.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The betting money would have to support the notion that we go through 
<br>
some kind of a singularity.  In any case we will find that we are into a new 
<br>
Renaissance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Germany, Australia, etal will continue to criticize us for not acting 
<br>
in their best interests instead of our own.  &lt;G&gt; Sorry the devil made me add 
<br>
that.
<br>
Ron h.
