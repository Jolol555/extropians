----&gt; Extropian Agro Forestry Ventures Inc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This thought experiment is based on the premise that in 2010 the ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fix all major medical problems has been achieved (heart attack,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stroke, cancer and lung problems) and that by 2015 the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve some forms of youthful appearance will have been achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (non-wrinkly skin, no moles, hair regrowth, control of hair colour).
</em><br>
<p>You won't even be close to fixing the major causes of death by 2010.
<br>
If by 2005 we fully understand how to isolate, cultivate and amplify
<br>
adult stem cells (pretty unlikely as well IMO), then you might begin
<br>
to make a major dent in the major causes of death starting around 2020
<br>
(at least in the well developed countries).  Even when you have fixed
<br>
the major causes of death, it seems likely that a host of new ailments
<br>
(akin to Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc., i.e. late onset diseases)
<br>
will begin to appear as you start having more people push into their
<br>
110's, 120's, etc.  Those may require decades of study to unravel and
<br>
fix.
<br>
<p>There is also a slice of society which does not wish to live long because
<br>
they either feel death is natural or inevitable and efforts to defeat death
<br>
are a waste of time and resources.
<br>
There is a segment of society that feels that if they personally cannot live
<br>
forever then no one else should either.
<br>
&quot;why should Bill Gates live forever and not me?&quot;
<br>
What is required is to develop a stategy to &quot;transform swords into
<br>
ploughshares&quot;, a Manhatten project on a global scale to transform the human
<br>
condition into the transhuman condition.
<br>
&quot;as Nero fiddles Rome burns&quot;
<br>
Can  any of us suggest  an overarching  methodology to accelerate this
<br>
process and increase its efficiency?
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>We have a very similar example right in front of us: the fight against AIDS
<br>
over the last 20 or 25 years. It all mirrors very nicely; the changing of
<br>
minds, the hectic research, the intense activism. If you look at how
<br>
activism shaped cultural perceptions and flows of money going into AIDS
<br>
research during the 80s, it's very impressive.
<br>
<p>The fight against aging could be played in the same way, if similarly
<br>
effective activism and awareness organizations can be created. I agree that
<br>
this is a long-term project; anyone likely to die in the next 30 years
<br>
should be hedging with cryonics. The alternative is pretty grim, however --
<br>
if we don't undertake this project, there is nothing to say that radical
<br>
life extension *will* happen fast enough to save those of us reading this.
<br>
Governments can block research. Finding cures for aging could turn out to be
<br>
far harder and more complex than imagined (as has happened with AIDS). There
<br>
really isn't any margin for sitting around and contemplating this sort of
<br>
thing.
