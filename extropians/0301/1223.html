<p>
The cost of a kilowatt-hour of &quot;wind generated&quot; electricity has declined from 
<br>
$.32 about ten years ago to about $.03 currently....and it's continuing to 
<br>
drop.  Right now only natural gas is cheaper.
<br>
<p>So far I've been involved in several  projects.  One in Oregon, One in 
<br>
Kansas, One in Iowa, One in Texas and one in California. By way of example 
<br>
the texas one was at King Mountain near Macamey Tx. and was about 250 
<br>
megawatts.   Right now texas is second to california with over a thousand 
<br>
megawatts of wind turbines....california has just shy of twice that.
<br>
<p>For calender year 2003 I've heard that about another thousand is to be 
<br>
installed nation wide.  About 250 in eastern New Mexico which I intend to be 
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p>There are a number of web sites for anyone interested.  For example the 
<br>
American Wind Energy Association.
<br>
<p>By the way....Denmark is the world leader in wind turbine manufacture. That 
<br>
texas project i was on was entirely Danish....we hauled the whole she-bang 
<br>
from Houston.   Several hundred  truckloads. (One complete Turbine requires 
<br>
half a dozen or more trucks each......BIG trucks....I was grossing over 100K 
<br>
lbs  with a overall  length in excess of 120 ft.)
<br>
<p>Naturally I'm in favor of Wind Turbines.  I'm making money off 'em.
<br>
<p>Some are not.....for the oddest reasons too. (birds run into them...theyre 
<br>
ugly...they only work when the wind blows....they interrupt the peace and 
<br>
tranquility of the desert scorpion...)
<br>
<p>I figure everything has advantages and disadvantages.  If a wind farm  only 
<br>
produces  18 hours a day in West Texas (or 12....or 10...while the wind is 
<br>
blowing)....then that means a coal fired plant down the road (with coal 
<br>
imported by train from wyoming)....can be run at a lower capacity and pollute 
<br>
less. (and the locomotives....NOT using low sulphur diesel....will also 
<br>
pollute less)
<br>
<p>I'll sacrafice a few burds for that.....
