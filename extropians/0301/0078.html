<p><em>&gt;This merry little piece by former extropian frequent-poster Lyle Burkhead

(quoted as `Augustine' in THE SPIKE) reminded me that it's *not* an
<br>
egregious libel to claim that some transhumanists are racists and fans of
<br>
Hitler.&lt;
<br>
<p>Okay, let's debate this.
<br>
<p>First, how can a transhumanist be a racist if the very meaning of
<br>
transhumanist runs counter to the very meaning of a racist?
<br>
<p>Or, are you stating that some *people who might call themselves
<br>
transhumanists through an association of some specific set of beliefs and
<br>
goals of transhumanists* are racists?
<br>
<p>If a person, such as Lyle Burkhead (I don't know him, but the name is
<br>
familiar),  or Mr. X, turns adverse to and disconnects from a belief system
<br>
that he once felt aligned to, and in his adversity begins to act in a
<br>
manner that is ethically questionable, would you call him the same person
<br>
who he had been in a very different mind set?
<br>
<p>Or, would you claim that Mr. X had some sort of mental disconnect and that
<br>
his behavior was more symptomatic of anger and range and that because of
<br>
this behavioral dysfunction was emotionally out of touch with reality?
<br>
<p>Or, would you claim that Mr. X was still the very same person he had been
<br>
and that the identity and affiliations he had once claimed were in a state
<br>
of stasis? -- That he was still a transhumanist (if he ever claimed to be,
<br>
I don't know) and that his strain or brand of beliefs, in their racist
<br>
tone, are transhumanist?
