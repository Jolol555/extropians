Some of you may not be aware that the The Mount Stromlo Observatory
<br>
near Canberra was destroyed by bushfires last weekend. Attached is
<br>
some news about it, and some links.

MOUNT STROMLO OBSERVATORY DESTROYED BY FIRE
<br>
<p>The Australian National University      [Mt Stromlo Admin Building]
<br>
expresses concern and sympathy to those
<br>
who have lost so much in the Canberra fires.
<br>
<p>In particular, our thoughts are with the families of those that
<br>
died in the fires.
<br>
<p>The Mount Stromlo Observatory has been largely destroyed by the
<br>
bushfires which have ravaged Canberra.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are thankful that no staff or students were injured in the
<br>
Mount Stromlo fire.&quot; ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Chubb said
<br>
today.
<br>
<p>The Observatory, operated by the ANU Research School of Astronomy
<br>
and Astrophysics, is one of Australia's leading centres of
<br>
Astronomical research. The fires destroyed four telescopes, the
<br>
equipment workshop, eight houses which had been occupied by staff
<br>
and an administration building. Preliminary estimates have valued
<br>
the losses at more than $20 million.
<br>
<p>Two office buildings and the visitors centre were spared -
<br>
importantly, preserving most of the computer data generated on site
<br>
in recent years.
<br>
<p>Professor Chubb emphasised that the work of the Research School
<br>
would continue.
<br>
<p>&quot;The loss of Mount Stromlo is a devastating blow to Australian
<br>
research and in particular to the 60 staff and 20 students who made
<br>
it their workplace.
<br>
<p>&quot;To those staff who also lost homes on Mount Stromlo, these fires
<br>
have delivered a double blow.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is vital to emphasise that the work of the Research School of
<br>
Astronomy and Astrophysics will continue, however. The University
<br>
has adequate workshop and laboratory facilities to accommodate the
<br>
valuable equipment contracts which are being fulfilled by the
<br>
school - including the $6.3 million contract to build a sharp-eyed
<br>
imager for the Gemini South Telescope in Chile.
<br>
<p>&quot;Other research projects have been undeniably set back by this
<br>
loss, although we are still evaluating the full extent of the
<br>
damage.
<br>
<p>&quot;Plans are already being put in place to rebuild at Mount Stromlo
<br>
and restore the Research School to its full capacity.
<br>
<p>&quot;The fires have been a devastating blow to Canberra and the ANU is
<br>
committed to helping rebuild the lives of those affected.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Director of the Research School, Professor Penny Sackett, said,
<br>
&quot;Our losses are presently overwhelming and the scene of Mount
<br>
Stromlo is one of devastation, but we have retained our most
<br>
valuable asset, our staff, 100 per cent intact and we are extremely
<br>
grateful for their safety.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We have also saved our computer database and many of us will be
<br>
back at work tomorrow.&quot;
