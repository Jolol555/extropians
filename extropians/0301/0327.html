Life Extension Daily - Eat Less, Live Longer ; Roy Walford's Research on 
<br>
Restrictive Dieting Gains Wider Acceptance
<br>
=========================================================================================================================

<br>
<p>For nearly three decades, Dr. Roy Walford has lived in a red- brick 
<br>
industrial building a half-block from the daily carnival and weekend 
<br>
hucksters of Venice Beach, Calif. And for much of that time, Walford, a 
<br>
University of California, Los Angeles, professor who pioneered the 
<br>
concept of a severely calorie-restrictive diet as a path to human 
<br>
longevity, was commonly viewed as a bit of an oddball, even in a 
<br>
neighborhood known for eccentric behavior. His unconventional lifestyle, 
<br>
be it studying with yoga masters in India or living for two years as the 
<br>
chief physician at the Biosphere 2 experiment, did little to enhance his 
<br>
image as a serious scientist.

Life Extension Foundation - Scientists Say Flavonoids Are Beginning to 
<br>
Find Favor in Nutrition
<br>
==============================================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.lef.org/news/nutrition/2003/01/05/TPKA/0000-4337-KEYWORD.Missing.html">http://www.lef.org/news/nutrition/2003/01/05/TPKA/0000-4337-KEYWORD.Missing.html</a>
<br>
<p>A food compound with an unusual name is fast becoming a shining star in 
<br>
human nutrition. Scientists are finding increasing evidence that a diet 
<br>
rich in flavonoids --- common in many plant foods --- helps decrease the 
<br>
risks of heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis, blood cholesterol and 
<br>
other chronic diseases.

The Globe And Mail - Obesity cuts life span dramatically, studies find
<br>
======================================================================

<a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20030108/UOBESN/national/national/national_temp/4/4/23/">http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20030108/UOBESN/national/national/national_temp/4/4/23/</a>
<br>
<p>The bigger your waistline, the less time you should spend planning your 
<br>
retirement. Research shows that the consequences of being overweight 
<br>
when young are more dramatic than previously believed: Obesity at age 20 
<br>
reduces a man's life expectancy by up to 20 years, and cuts as many as 
<br>
eight years off a woman's life. Another study finds that being 
<br>
overweight reduces life expectancy more than smoking does.

EurekAlert - Computer program reveals optimum microstructure for new

materials
<br>
==============================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/pu-cpr010703.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-01/pu-cpr010703.php</a>
<br>
<p>Salvatore Torquato and colleagues used computers to calculate the 
<br>
optimum structure for any material that is a composite of two substances 
<br>
with differing properties. The achievement is the first simple example 
<br>
of a mathematically rigorous method for optimizing the design of 
<br>
multifunctional composites, which are an increasingly common kind of 
<br>
material.

EurekAlert - Next-generation solar cells could put power stations in space
<br>
==========================================================================

<br>
<p>Someday, large-scale solar power stations in space could beam 
<br>
electricity to the surface of the moon, the earth and other planets, 
<br>
decreasing our dependence on a dwindling fossil-fuel supply. Scientists 
<br>
at Rochester Institute of Technology are developing the next generation 
<br>
of solar cells, advancing the technology that could put a solar power 
<br>
system into earth's orbit.

<p>Returning to Einstein's nagging doubts about quantum mechanics, Nobel 
<br>
laureate Gerard 't Hooft of Utrecht University has begun to outline a 
<br>
way in which its apparent play of chance might be underpinned by precise

physical laws that describe the way the world works...

New Scientist - First speed of gravity measurement revealed

<br>
<p>The speed of gravity has been measured for the first time. The landmark 
<br>
experiment shows that it travels at the speed of light, meaning that 
<br>
Einstein's general theory of relativity has passed another test with 
<br>
flying colours.

Space.com - Way-Out World: New Technique Finds Most Distant Planet Ever
<br>
=======================================================================
<br>
<a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planet_transit_030106.html">http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planet_transit_030106.html</a>
<br>
<p>The most distant known planet, a large and hot world pelted by iron rain 
<br>
and orbiting a star about 5,000 light-years away, has been found with a 
<br>
new and promising search technique. The discovery extends astronomers 
<br>
capabilities for planet hunting beyond the roughly 160 light-years of 
<br>
nearby space in which other planets had been found. The number of stars 
<br>
that can now be examined jumps from 40,000 to 100 million or more, said 
<br>
the scientists involved in the discovery.
