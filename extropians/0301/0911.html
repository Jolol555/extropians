<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Military intervention in the Middle East holds many dangers. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does indeed. The US could lose the war, for instance. Saddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy in the last wars was stupid, to say something polite. Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against Iran and the US he was copying the Verdun 1916 situation. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't successful against Iran and against the US, it was a pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desaster because the US forces did not need to fight this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they used their superior air force to smash them. Now what happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Saddam distributes his army in the cities, basically hiding behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children and women. The US forces would need to fight for each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every house. Is the US prepared for another gorilla war after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnam?
</em><br>
<p>A guerrilla war occurs when the insurgents are un-uniformed, do not use
<br>
heavy weapons, and have the support of the common people. Iraqi
<br>
soldiers have none of these, they will be using their own people as
<br>
hostages. All we need to do is go in at night, when our NVG technology
<br>
works and they don't have any. Street fighting is not so difficult with
<br>
such a tactical advantage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. The US forces get too lax and make a mistake. Iraqi ground forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch a fast attack on Saudi/Kuwait territory, forcing the surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US forces into a large scale ground battle?
</em><br>
<p>I am sure the last thing the iraqis want is to piss off Saudis. What
<br>
they will more likely do is attack Israel with missiles, likely laden
<br>
with WMD. This will bring dancing in the streets across the muslim
<br>
world, and the reply by Isreal will make things difficult for us, but
<br>
no impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After a first success there might be other Arabian leaders joining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war on Saddam's side and suddenly we have the war here in Europe. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate to see Daimler, Volkswagen and BMW produce robots-of-war instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of luxury cars.
</em><br>
<p>yeah, it's too bad they might impact the european economy to the degree
<br>
ours already has been by 9/11. It would just be 'orrible if your
<br>
average european couldn't afford as much brie and wine as s/he is used
<br>
to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is because we believe that, if Saddam does not yield,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action may eventually be the least awful necessity for Iraq, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Middle East and for the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .... since awful oil prices like we have now are not good for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy. Bombing Iraq into the ground will lead to plenty of orders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the war. Siemens can sell a pro West Iraq all the nuclear power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plants they don't need and Lockheed can rebuild the Iraqi air force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All payed with cheap oil. Wonderful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who in his right state of mind believes that humanitarian issues are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Bush family's equation?
</em><br>
<p>I am positive that Dubya's primary personal goal is to settle a score
<br>
and right a mistake of his father. However, this does not make what he
<br>
is doing wrong. It is alright to do the right things for the wrong reasons.
