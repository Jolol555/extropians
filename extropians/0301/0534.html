</em><br>
<p>Thank you for your analysis.  My working hypothesis is that
<br>
your analysis is in substantial agreement with Eliezer's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Using &quot;belief&quot; on the other hand may or may not leave room for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such critical consideration.  It might be blind or absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief held to be beyond questioning.
</em><br>
<p>That's possible, of course.  It's also possible that the speaker
<br>
of B has chosen this wording to avoid being candid.  I myself 
<br>
chose this wording just now, &quot;My working hypothesis is that
<br>
your analysis...&quot; because a number of people are apt to read
<br>
it more sympathetically this way.
<br>
<p>Me saying &quot;I believe that your... &quot;, would be---to them
<br>
---not at all equivalent.  Politicians should take note!
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  I should take a sec to credit you with the first use
<br>
in this discussion of the phrase &quot;working hypothesis&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we can upgrade even the uncritical to say, &quot;this is my
