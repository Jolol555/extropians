Robert said
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The price of oil is subject to a complex &quot;present value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; analysis&quot; of both the countries producing it and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consumers.  It comes down to a question of &quot;do I gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more by pumping the oil or leaving it in the ground?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Lee Responds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who ever gains more by leaving it the ground?  (Besides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. farmers, I mean.)
</em><br>
<p>Many people I'm afraid. It's a question of time horizons. You compare the
<br>
return you would get by pumping the oil now to what you might get in the
<br>
future assuming (a) you, your heirs or assigns will still control it  (b)
<br>
other sources have been depleted in the meantime and (c) there's been no
<br>
technological breakthrough in the meantime to cause a slump in demand. This
<br>
doesn't just apply to oil the same is true of other resources, above all
<br>
land. It can pay not to devlop land but to leave it idle if this leads to a
<br>
rise in its capital value or to a rise in rents at a future date.
<br>
<p>Robert again
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You have to assume that (a) the U.S. (or Europe) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; act to pump-up-the volume with respect to Iraqi oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; production (and there is no useful knowledge with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; respect to the degree they could do that given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decade of decay in the production capabilities) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the (b) the Saudis (or other OPEC or even non-OPEC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; members) would not act in a way to offset the production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increase that Iraq *might* be able to achieve.
</em><br>
<p>Lee again
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What?  If we assume that Iraqi oil production goes up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you are saying that this would be offset by other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries *lowering* their production?  Leaving all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profits to Iraq?  That's not how markets work.  Unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they achieve a cartel, it forces down the world market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price of oil, right?
</em><br>
<p>But this *is* what some producers have done in the past
<br>
particularly the Saudis. You forgo profits in the short term (let them
<br>
accrue to whoever controls Iraq) in the expectation that the income your
<br>
resource will generate in the future will be greater than it would otherwise
<br>
be. An important consideration here is the time horizon of the Saudi rulers.
<br>
If they think they are going to be overthrown in the near future they have
<br>
every reason to cash in their chips now but if they are confident of holding
<br>
on the incentives work the other way.
<br>
Robert
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, there are disruptions, e.g. Venezuela or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pipelines being blown up (or not built due to political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems), etc.  But you are living in a fantasy world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if you think most oil producing nations are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pump oil at $10/bbl).  They *know* the supply will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eventually decline.
</em><br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and as the resource &quot;eventually&quot; runs out, the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed goes up.  But it goes up in accordance with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws of supply and demand.  Don't you acknowledge that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Saudis and everyone else are trying to make as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money as they can?
</em><br>
<p>Yes but when - within what time horizon?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Lee concludes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why, no.  Of course they'll have to change their behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They'll either have to lower their price or sell less.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. There's a third option (although you could say it's another
<br>
version of the second). The factor that might well make the Saudis behave
<br>
the way you predict lee, is the demographics they face. They have a lot of
<br>
overqualified young men and not enough jobs for them (jobs they are keen on
<br>
that is) so a decline in oil income has sever political implications for
<br>
them.
