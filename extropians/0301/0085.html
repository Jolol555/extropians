Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Dr Gary Schwartz's THE AFTERLIFE EXPERIMENTS
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Without taking the time to read the book myself,
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not worth buying; I found a library copy.
<br>
<p>The book is replete with New Age idiocies and All You Need Is Love Love Love
<br>
(the good doctor should change his name to Gary Schmaltz). However, the most
<br>
interesting `reading' is described in the form of a scientific paper (J.
<br>
Soc. Psych. Res., 2001), given as Appendix E, pp. 334-54. Other Appendices
<br>
summarize earlier chapters in less icky form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; are you willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be more specific about what you still find convincing given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rather severe methodological errors, nature of cold reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on?
</em><br>
<p>They finally made the amazing methodological breakthrough [why didn't they
<br>
*start* with this? beats me] to trials in which a medium in Arizona
<br>
attempted a report (aided by advisors `on the other side') significantly and
<br>
uniquely relevant to the sitter in Los Angeles, under 3 conditions: in
<br>
advance of normal contact; while a phone link existed but was muted for 10
<br>
minutes; finally, in spoken dialogue between sitter and medium, the only
<br>
condition in which cold reading could occur. It is claimed that 4 items of
<br>
idiosyncratic information was given in that last condition which was unknown
<br>
to the sitter, but was later confirmed. Other numerous coincidences are
<br>
reported even in the pre-contact period.
<br>
<p>I make no claims myself about all this, merely noting that there is some
<br>
provocative and perhaps puzzling material reported. It is interesting that
<br>
the professional parapsychologists I know are fairly dismissive of Schwartz,
<br>
who unreservedly endorses the TV medium John Edward [?!].
