This is something that has been of interest to me for a while. Such traits
<br>
as dairy farming and alcohol absorption have been alleged to take about
<br>
10,000 years to be transmitted to the general population after a suitable
<br>
mutation arises.
<br>
<p>General babble
<br>
<p>It makes me think about mutation types: cosmic ray, genetic transfer faults.
<br>
I am not certain how many transfer &quot;faults&quot; may be a mechanism to accelerate
<br>
&quot;possibilities&quot; in localized areas of dna. I wonder about the mechanisms for
<br>
increased rates of change in terms of the lifespans of our ancestors. That
<br>
is, amongst multicellular organisms, mutations spread when somatic cells
<br>
with chromosones with that mutation split more frequently. Chromosones being
<br>
the stronger base, more than dna. It makes me think of the lifespans of the
<br>
organisms containing my particular chromosones radiating back in time. How
<br>
many generations? For humans, 15 years between generations of the
<br>
multicellular carrier, for my smaller mammalian ancestors (say 200 to 50
<br>
million years back) I'm not sure - if they're like rats, I guess a few
<br>
weeks. What's before then? Something like a lizardy salamander? The earliest
<br>
vertebrate. You are talking about 300 or 200 million years from the Cambrian
<br>
explosion to something like an animal on land with a backbone. Tens of
<br>
billions of generations for the lot? If a chromosone holds the equivalent of
<br>
40 megabytes or whatever of information, it is interesting to speculate on
<br>
rates of exposure to cosmic rays in the somatic cells, the chances of that
<br>
particular somatic cell (do they have stem cells as such in the male? ova I
<br>
think have a limited number) being &quot;hit&quot;, size of potential damage. Over
<br>
types of causes of mutations, breakdown, substance exposure (some must be
<br>
possible in nature). Movement from lots of short generations to fewer longer
<br>
generations must start at some point between 50 and 15 million years before
<br>
now, but when, and how fast does this change occur? You can see that the
<br>
number of operations is not exceedingly vast, in certain areas at least.
<br>
Makes you think of the possibilities of simulations, artificial life games,
<br>
problem-solving mechanisms.

<p><p><em>&gt; Those of you who know me well know that I am no fan of dairy products.
</em><br>
They
<br>
<em>&gt; are not part of our genetic heritage, having been introduced into the
</em><br>
human
<br>
<em>&gt; diet only very recently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are not genetically adapted to the proteins and sugars in dairy
</em><br>
products.
<br>
<em>&gt; For that reason they are in my opinion a likely source of many modern
</em><br>
health
<br>
<em>&gt; problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is news about the the earliest evidence of dairy, which dates back
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt; about 6 to 8 thousand years. This is barely a blink of an eye in
</em><br>
comparison
<br>
<em>&gt; to the multi-million year evolutionary history of homo sapiens.

<em>&gt; Earliest Evidence of Dairy Farming Found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mon Jan 27, 5:01 PM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WASHINGTON - Dairy farming became widespread in Britain as early as the
</em><br>
new
<br>
<em>&gt; stone age - around 4,000 B.C. - a team of researchers at England's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University of Bristol reports.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mark Copley, an archaeological chemist, said evidence of milk fats was
</em><br>
found
<br>
<em>&gt; on broken pieces of pottery at several ancient sites in southern England.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Using new methods of analysis, scientists have learned to differentiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between ancient residue from milk fat and other fats and oils in recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, Copley and his team report in Proceedings of the National Academy
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their findings provide evidence of &quot;the earliest farming communities in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Britain, though obviously there were earlier ones in the Near East,&quot;
</em><br>
Copley
<br>
<em>&gt; said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Animals were domesticated in the Near East about 8,000 B.C. Copley
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained, and by the time farming practices reached England, dairying had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become widely incorporated, using animals for both their meat and milk,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Copley said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He said the team hopes to trace the spread of dairying from the Near East
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through Southeast Europe and the Balkans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While the chemical testing can detect milkfats, Copley said he didn't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly how the milk was being used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, he added, &quot;when you consider how soon milk goes off, it's most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely they were making butter, cheese or yogurt ... which actually keep a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long time.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By analyzing residue on pots and other artifacts from ancient communities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Copley said, archaeologists are &quot;building up quite a big picture of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancient economies actually worked.&quot;
