</em><br>
<p>That's my guess, too. Actually, though, both Anders and I came up with the
<br>
idea independently, and Mitch Porter and Charlie Stross later added some
<br>
spin to it. I make use of it in my forthcoming novel with Rory Barnes,
<br>
FOREVER. Here's part of the passage from THE SPIKE:
<br>
<p>======
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earliest zillionths of the Big Bang eruption, time was effectively
<br>
multiplied to infinite speed, but it slowed fast as spacetime expanded and
<br>
cooled. Inconceivably vast numbers of force-particle exchanges occurred
<br>
almost instantly in a densely compacted and connected spacetime where the
<br>
four known forces of physics only `slowly' decoupled from a unitary force
<br>
now lost forever, unless there's a Big Crunch at the end of the universe.
<br>
Might not there have been virtual time enough, effectively, for a
<br>
superintelligence to evolve from scratch? Even a whole bunch of them, but
<br>
perhaps they would inevitably remain merged in a swarm-mind until the cosmos
<br>
was big enough for light-transmission delays to disrupt module
<br>
communication...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a suggestion that eerily resembles the teachings of the ancient
<br>
Gnostics, in a way. The Gnostics held that our world is not the creation of
<br>
an original supreme deity, but is the rather botched handiwork of a less
<br>
god, a demiurge. Imagine not one but many angelic demiurges, the
<br>
first-evolved minds in our cooling universe, tumbling from the furnace of
<br>
the Big Bang, cast out into the freezing dark. Perhaps placing their impress
<br>
upon the new regimes of matter and light. Yes, now there is a god...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, if so, that was then. What of today? Would such `angels' still have
<br>
any impact on the universe?  Would their works persist in the fabric of
<br>
spacetime? The galaxies extend into space in colossal strings made of
<br>
billions of stars wrapped about dark bubbled gaps, an arrangement that
<br>
deeply puzzles cosmologists. Might this strange architecture be the remnant
<br>
of some ancient design of the earliest life born of the Big Bang? More to
<br>
the point, is the evolution of such `angels' remotely possible in the light
<br>
of current physics?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could any kind of high-level structure emerge under such appallingly
<br>
volatile conditions, however many virtual steps or epochs it contains? It's
<br>
one thing for life to persist into a Big Crunch, as Tipler proposes, using
<br>
`shear energy' (the gravitational ebbs and flows of shockingly twisted
<br>
spacetime).  Presumably it's quite another for complex `life' to bootstrap
<br>
into existence from nothing under the same conditions. Or is it?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mitchell Porter agrees that the main barrier to Big Bang superintelligences
<br>
is the absence of structure in the fantastically hot primordial plasma. `But
<br>
conceivably,' he notes, `there may have been epochs of structure in the
<br>
course of the many phase transitions which are part of modern cosmological
<br>
models of the early universe, and perhaps things were evolving rapidly
<br>
enough for replicators to evolve.' That catches it exactly. The contrast has
<br>
been pointed up by Charles Stross, a British writer and software specialist:
<br>
in Tipler's scenario the pre-Omega entity deliberately sets up oscillations
<br>
in the collapsing universe, extracting usable energy. But did the Big Bang
<br>
have equivalent energy gradients, available to drive such computational
<br>
processes?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cosmos shortly after the Bang was a homogeneous soup of radiation
<br>
looking the same in all directions, Stross notes. On the other hand, the
<br>
Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE) detected ripples in the
<br>
background radiation that suffused the universe. These are the enduring
<br>
traces of lumpiness left in the pervasive radiation residue from the Big
<br>
Bang. Later data from the COBE satellite suggested that they are, indeed,
<br>
fractal in nature, ripples within wrinkles--perhaps enough to provide the
<br>
gradients necessary to jump-start a primordial replicator.
<br>
<p>The earliest ages of the universe
<br>
<p>The opening fractions of a second in this universe contained ample variety.
<br>
`GUT Age, Quark Age, Hadron Age, Nucleosynthetic Age, Plasma Age,
<br>
Fireball...' Jonathan Burns, a La Trobe University computer scientist,
<br>
suggests with a certain whimsy that, given these phases, `the blindest
<br>
watchmaker would have had opportunity enough.' He adds:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the odds for an intelligent ontology? On Darwinian grounds one
<br>
seems to need:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A substrate stable enough for some Selfish Form to persist and multiply
<br>
in competitive variation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A phenomenon which can be coded, and decoded, into a genotype which
<br>
replicates the code.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Time for enough iterations that the code space can be explored by the
<br>
population, long enough to find the breakthrough points to higher
<br>
organization.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Time enough for the higher organization to explore its environment, and
<br>
exploit the opportunities for technological enhancement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A radically uncertain measure of good luck.
<br>
<p>And Burns took up the idea of ancient demiurges with a poetic burst of his
<br>
own: `The Benefactors... skating the contours of zero tidal force... their
<br>
wingtips deep in blazing quicksand...'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could such a selfish code-string persist though the fires of the Big Bang,
<br>
and in the cooling cosmos left as its ashes? For a selfish signal to survive
<br>
in a sea of noise, it has to perform its own noise reduction. Emergent
<br>
exotica might stabilise briefly--vortices, frequency bands, phase
<br>
boundaries--to form a first substrate. Efficient signal self-replication
<br>
would use digital encoding, the simplest possible but rich enough to do the
<br>
job. After all, we know that populations of data structures inside computers
<br>
can already evolve, exploring combinational spaces efficiently, turning
<br>
combinational complexity to advantage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this kind of digital evolution plausible for the primordial universe?
<br>
`The bulk properties of Grand Unified Theory plasmas are speculative, to say
<br>
the least,' Burns notes. `Electromagnetic plasmas, yes, there are stable
<br>
structures, Alfven waves, in the right conditions. And in cold bulk matter,
<br>
we get quantized magnetic flux tubes, and liquid-helium quantized vortices.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physics has only vague ideas of how quark-gluon plasmas might behave. `One
<br>
place to look for a clawhold might be at the point where the quark-gluon
<br>
plasma is breaking into clusters. In the &quot;big bag&quot; of the plasma, one gets
<br>
incursions of vacuum, which acts as a superconductor for colour-charge. For
<br>
a sufficient epoch, just maybe the plasma is riddled with quantized
<br>
chromodynamic flux-tubes in bunches. Asymmetry. Structure. Bistability.
<br>
Gates and switches. Chemistry. New tubes being generated all the time, those
<br>
which don't match our patterns discarded, the rest assembled into new
<br>
entities.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with a conjectural break-up of the GUT plasma, or the
<br>
compactification of the hidden dimensions. Emergent novelties, as Nobel
<br>
laureate Ilya Prigogine argues, are often found at phase boundaries where
<br>
energy is being exported into the environment. But still we wouldn't expect
<br>
to find an infinite number of successive phase changes from the Bang to very
<br>
shortly afterward, the literally uncountable sort required for a Tiplerian
<br>
scenario. At the smallest scale at the start of time, quantum theory tells
<br>
us, we would find everything-at-once, space and time smeared together and
<br>
confused. If you can't count the ticks or intervals between each event and
<br>
the next, or determine one place from another, it is impossible to create
<br>
the structure needed for an intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, an infinite number of steps might not be required. After all, life
<br>
has evolved and flourished on Earth in less than four billion years--quite a
<br>
lot of separate clock ticks, but a good deal fewer than infinity. The
<br>
ancient minds might have evolved and left their mark.
<br>
<p>Traces of primordial engineering?
<br>
<p>What legacy might such demiurges leave for us to find? It could range from
<br>
the very large, such as cosmological gravitational waves, or the very small,
<br>
such as strange matter in pulsars. `If the angels broke through to the
<br>
mid-range, they could build just about any material structure,' Burns
<br>
comments. But is there anything in our stellar environment that can't be
<br>
accounted for by available science? Well, there remain those mysterious
<br>
cosmological features, the vast empty voids, and the so-called Great
<br>
Attractor that appears to be dragging all the local galaxies toward a
<br>
particular place in the heavens. And dark matter, up to 90 percent of the
<br>
mass of the cosmos, remains an unsolved question.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If I were an angel,' Burns remarks wryly, `I'd be inclined to look out for
<br>
my own skin. Maybe I could replicate myself on the cooler, rarer strata of
<br>
the heat death. But in my epoch, the alternative of forming exotic black
<br>
holes and maybe impressing myself on a new universe, if that's possible,
<br>
would seem a lot more practical than it does to us atom-age relics.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still more delightfully bizarre is a playful conjecture based on Tipler's
<br>
cosmological deity, advanced by Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life evolves towards the Omega Point, but in the vicinity of the final
<br>
moment `angels', life based on back-propagating causality (which Tipler's
<br>
theory seems to imply) are created and move backwards through time. They are
<br>
unobservable in the present, since they are acausal from our perspective...
<br>
and probably very thinly spread (possibly `extinct'). Eventually conditions
<br>
become better and better for them, they spread across the universe and use
<br>
the shear energy to create the Alpha Point--which is isomorphic to the Omega
<br>
Point and creates `angels' moving forward in time. Note that if the
<br>
backwards-moving beings use shear energy from the `collapse' of the universe
<br>
they see, this may explain the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe
<br>
despite the chaos of the Big Bang--from our perspective they smoothed the
<br>
early universe!
<br>
<p>In terms of scientific cosmology this entire arabesqued line of thought is
<br>
strictly unnecessary, since science does not lack in more modest
<br>
explanations for its outstanding conundrums. Still, improbable as it is, it
<br>
does bear a piquant resemblance to the issues that might arise when Powers
<br>
in a post-Spike history start to reformat their virtual and real
<br>
environments.
