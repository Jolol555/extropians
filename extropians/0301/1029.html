LC&gt;&gt; Well, yes, death is bad.  And war, which involves lots of death, is
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very bad.  But there are worse things, like suffering and slavery.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; And there are times when the application of deadly violence /saves/
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lives.  Avoiding war is a noble sentiment.  But avoiding a war that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is needed to free an enslaved people, or avoiding a war that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; needed to stop a genocide or a conquest, is elevating the sentiment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; above reason.  And the idea that war is never necessary to do those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; things is not rationally supportable.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
EY&gt; Yes, that's why when Bush said he was not interested in nation-building, 
<br>
<em>&gt; he lost any chance of my sympathy.  The Marshall Plan is one of the few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases I can think of where war worked historically.  I'd still be very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous around war just on general principles, but at least it's something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where, a few past times in history, there was a positive result.  There'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a *hope* of it being for the best.
</em><br>
<p>Well, he didn't exactly say he wasn't interested, only that he didn't
<br>
think the US should be involved.  He wants to leave the job to the UN, the
<br>
same organization that just democratically elected Libya to chair its
<br>
Human Rights Commission...
