</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ok Dan you got me :-)  Having seen the paper was 28 pages
<br>
I was not super-inclined to read it, but in a manner that has
<br>
some resonance with a theme in the paper itself, (that &quot;family
<br>
members&quot; will do things for each other that they would not
<br>
do for &quot;anonymous&quot; others in society), I have now read the
<br>
paper due to the additional impetus of you (an extropian I 
<br>
presume) wanting to discuss it. Without your interest and 
<br>
prompting I would almost certainly have chosen to have
<br>
invested my time in reading something else.
<br>
<p>What we do now, that you (I presume:-) )and I, have read it,
<br>
I am not sure though. Any conversation we have might now 
<br>
be based on a specific knowledge of the paper that might
<br>
be hard for others who don't have the time or inclination to
<br>
read it to follow. This offers a poor return on investment 
<br>
effort for a &quot;social politician&quot; like myself but what the hell.
<br>
<p>Now to the point. 
<br>
<p>I agree Horwitz is approaching family as social phenomena.
<br>
<p>He (Horwitz) does assume it exist (quite validly in my view)
<br>
and does then proceed to consider it from a variety of 
<br>
disciplinary standpoints such as, the economic, the sociological
<br>
and the psychological, and to some extent the legal.
<br>
<p>Horwitz, sets as background the notion that there has been 
<br>
some &quot;grand debate&quot; around &quot;the question of the market
<br>
versus the state&quot;. He invokes Hayek as am eminent thinker
<br>
in this area and points out that its generally accepted that
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;the market and the state do not exhaust all possible sets 
<br>
of social institutions&quot; and that amongst these is the family.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Horwitz asserts that Hodgson, apparently a critic of Hayek,
<br>
argues that &quot;given the supposed devotion of Hayekians to 
<br>
&quot;market individualism,&quot; there is no room within their 
<br>
ideological framework for institutions such as the family&quot;.
<br>
And that in Hodgson's view, Hayekians, to be consistent,
<br>
must banish the family.
<br>
<p>Horowitz then sets out in the paper to show that 'Hodgson's
<br>
claim that Hayekians believe that &quot;the market is the best way
<br>
of ordering all socio-economic activities&quot; is simply false. And
<br>
that there is nothing in Hayek's social theory to suggest that
<br>
the institution of the family has become unnecessary due to
<br>
the march of &quot;market individualism&quot;.
<br>
<p>Horowitz's paper &quot;explores the existing theories of the 
<br>
*functions* of the family with an eye towards examining
<br>
the relevance of these functions within Hayekian social 
<br>
theory. 
<br>
<p>Along the way, and striping away much of the background
<br>
positioning, he makes the point that family can be considered
<br>
and should be considered from the separate standpoints
<br>
of what are the &quot;functions&quot; of families (widely defined) and 
<br>
what are forms of families (with new forms clearly emerging).
<br>
<p>I think Horwitz does a good job of laying out a groundwork
<br>
for considering families in terms of their function separately 
<br>
to considering them in terms of their form, and he also makes
<br>
the point that to date these two aspects have been blurred 
<br>
together to the detriment of clear social policy.
<br>
<p>The functions of a family outlined by Horwitz include: 
<br>
<p>(A) some aspect of acting as an economic unit do to the &quot;fact&quot;
<br>
that families tend to share at least one household and 
<br>
households tend to utilize some economies such as division of 
<br>
labor and specialisation and buying power etc.
<br>
<p>(B) From a sociological standpoint families are the primary
<br>
locus of socialization instilling and reinforcing social values in
<br>
microcosm and allowing children to learn social skills in a
<br>
forgiving context rich environment.
<br>
<p>(C) From a legal standpoint families name their members, 
<br>
denoting some &quot;identity&quot; and the legal frameworks of society
<br>
determine substantially the sorts of forms of family that can
<br>
exist and provide incentives and disincentives for some forms.
<br>
<p>(D) From a psychological standpoint families especially in
<br>
relation to children provide &quot;secure attachment bonds&quot; which
<br>
enable infants the security they need in order to have the 
<br>
confidence to explore, play, learn and develop.
<br>
<p>The forms of the family include (but significantly, are not
<br>
limited too): Male-Female, (married or defacto), Male-female
<br>
with child or children, Single parent, Gay couples, extended 
<br>
families etc etc. Horwitz's point is that the changing forms
<br>
of family are causing concern in areas of the community 
<br>
particularly because the members of the community don't 
<br>
seem to clearly get that the useful functions can be preserved
<br>
in many cases in different forms of family. Indeed some new
<br>
forms of family may in many particular cases be more
<br>
functional. Divorces, separations, child-care, opportunities for
<br>
women to escape economic dependence may all have the
<br>
effect of retaining in the family those things that are good and
<br>
eliminating those things that can be done just as well by the
<br>
market. Eg. Instead of a mother spending heaps of time
<br>
on domestic chores unrelated to direct care-giving she may 
<br>
earn money and use that money to pay for alternate ways
<br>
of getting chores done. She may still choose to spend &quot;quality
<br>
time&quot;, time at play etc with the child and possibly this makes 
<br>
the family's core functions better able to be carried out. In
<br>
some cases. Its horses for courses. That's Horowitz's point.
<br>
<p>I think Horwitz's thrusts are essentially correct, if not 
<br>
particularly profound, but then often things do look a lot more
<br>
obvious *after* they have been reasonable well explained. 
<br>
I think that as  transhumanists and extropians are strongly 
<br>
concerned with shaping and choosing from possible futures, 
<br>
and with taking what has served us well in the past forward
<br>
whilst modifying or dropping what has no longer serves us
<br>
well that the paper makes some interesting suggestions and 
<br>
the point on the prudence of decoupling function and form of
<br>
family seems sound.
<br>
<p>Imo, the functions of family will largely remain important going
<br>
forward. Whilst the forms of family are, will and should change.
<br>
But this is still not an area of strong interest to me personally
<br>
so I am especially open to alternative views as I have barely
<br>
formed any views of my own at all. 
<br>
<p>So. What do you want to discuss about the paper?
<br>
