Ah, another chance to combat misperceptions, disinformation, and

ignorance...

<em>&gt; I know this idea is going to be attacked since many of the people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list are authors. I'm not purposefully trying to make enemies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know it seems that way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why aren't these books available on programs like napster. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a ton af them, kazaa, imesh, bearshare ect.... I'm searched and found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing. We could make all the books under a special search like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extrotrans3456&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean i haven't bought a CD in like 5 years. Why shouldn't we be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to download books as well. I know it's illegal, but no one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing anything about the free music.
</em><br>
<p>Just because you don't get a ticket every time you speed doesn't mean
<br>
you aren't breaking the law. While there are many laws on the books
<br>
(including speed limits) which in my opinion do nothing but promote
<br>
disrespect for the Law in general, to give in to that seed of
<br>
disrespect is the road not to Anarchy, but chaos, which is an entirely
<br>
undesirable thing for anybody.
<br>
<p>There is a place for civil disobedience, for sure. But don't mask pure
<br>
greedy looting as anything more noble than what it really is, and not
<br>
wanting to pay for someone else's hard work is far more greedy and
<br>
selfish than the creator wanting to get paid for their work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really though shouldn't these books be available to anyone for free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For transhumanistic ideas to gain a greater base shouldn't it be free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the bible.
</em><br>
<p>The Bible was a world wide best seller long before free copies of it
<br>
were available. In fact, for more than a thousand years of history,
<br>
copies of the bible were so expensive that they cost several years
<br>
salary to obtain one. Churches were so ubiquitous in communities
<br>
because of the huge community investment needed to house that one book,
<br>
and to have someone who was literate to read it to the rest of the
<br>
community, to protect that one book from damage by hands soiled in the
<br>
fields, or callused from the plow or the smithy.
<br>
<p>For a good chunk of human history, the Bible has been the equivalent of
<br>
the computer: a rather expensive device, even in it's most inexpensive
<br>
versions, and never found for free, though one might be borrowed for a
<br>
time, as at a library.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What it comes down to is where is the money going that is generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by these books. If most of it is just going into someone's pocket 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tham I'm sorry that seems very unextropian to me. 
</em><br>
<p>Then you don't know the first thing about extropy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know people have to make a living but beyond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there main concern should be to make as big an impact as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can.
</em><br>
<p>Extropy is not a religion. It doesn't need to evangelize, it simply is,
<br>
and becomes, as a result of it reflecting Objective Truth in a more
<br>
accurate, scientific way, not superstitious guesswork and flim
<br>
flammery.
