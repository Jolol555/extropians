<em>&gt; Oh, a great deal has been accomplished!  The whole emphasis

</em><br>
<p>Um... the morality we're trying to maximize seems to me to occupy a 
<br>
logically prior level to determining which laws are &quot;time-tested&quot;, insofar 
<br>
as morality would provide the fitness metric against which I determined 
<br>
which particular laws are good or bad.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Firstly, however, I note that your paragraph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentions nothing about the law---it's as if we are in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawless space colonies, and we are only interested in examining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we *approve* of.  But intervention is often an entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different matter!
</em><br>
<p>The law is an abstraction built up from the approvals and disapprovals of 
<br>
individuals, including approval and disapproval of the particular class of 
<br>
actions known as interventions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Even if &quot;Is it my business?&quot; and &quot;Is it BAD?&quot; are different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;intuitions, what is it that makes one more interesting than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simply put, it's all about intervention, as you say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Specifically, intervening in cases where it is none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the law's business.  For example, were they brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back to life suddenly, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would look at you incredulously were one to suggest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the government regulate whether you could burn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a flag or a cross on your own premises.
</em><br>
<p>Um... nice recursion there, but you still haven't answered why your own 
<br>
&quot;intervening in this case is none of the law's business&quot; is in any wise 
<br>
more interesting than a libertarian's &quot;intervening in this case is BAD&quot;, 
<br>
nor indeed why they are not equivalent viewpoints.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;For me the archetypal example of a communicable moral case for third-party 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;intervention is where party A is attempting to kill nonconsenting party B. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In this case, I will, if I can, intervene to prevent A from killing B. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next time I'm in south central L.A., I will recall your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advice, but I may more sensibly conclude that in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases it's none of my business whether one gang-banger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks another.  Now an exception to this might arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we pass laws making it illegal (shudder) for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bystander to fail to become involved.  But do you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any examples that sound as though they might trouble me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerning my &quot;we mind our own business&quot; attitude?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already discussed Damien's fine example.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't provide you with any kind of advice.  I simply stated a personal 
<br>
position of mine, that I will intervene if I can.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, &quot;if I can&quot;, in this case, excludes attacking a militarily 
<br>
superior force; but I would readily call the police, thus applying force 
<br>
by proxy.  Which I would certainly never do if I considered the matter 
<br>
&quot;none of my business&quot;, whether it was illegal or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;My own argument?  I freely admit that a woman mutilating her baby is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;more complex case than a woman mutilating an actively protesting adult, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;since it involves an attempt to extrapolate forward what the baby would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;want,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect that whenever acting &quot;just for someone's own good,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether they realize it or not&quot;, gets problematical beyond belief.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it gets very problematical very fast.  It is still a problem that I 
<br>
cannot avoid confronting where babies are involved.  Perhaps you confuse 
<br>
&quot;acting for the good of an incomplete mind which lacks the cognitive 
<br>
capability to realize X&quot; with &quot;claiming to act 'for the good of' a fully 
<br>
adult entity who is actively objecting to it&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No.  How the laws are written, and hence who the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will side with, cannot be settled by moral argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The far less idealistic approach, which has been shown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be vastly more workable, has been to observe in what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways successful societies seem to maximize benefit and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prosperity by having enormous regard for individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen legal rights, and enormous regard for private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property.  To be sure, as Hayek explains, we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be open to new experiments and ideas, however.
</em><br>
<p>Maximize benefit and prosperity for what class of entities?  If you aren't 
<br>
counting babies and simulations in the tally, then your assessment of what 
<br>
&quot;works&quot; is based on a quite different metric for workingness.  I'm sure 
<br>
that if you don't count slaves as people, then slaveowning societies can 
<br>
be shown to maximize benefit and prosperity (for slaveowners) by having 
<br>
enormous regard for &quot;private property&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The same holds for a sentient in a simulation running on a computer you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;suppose yourself to &quot;own&quot;.  You've gone on record on saying that it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;none of your business&quot; what someone does with &quot;their&quot; simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I am just as much against ownership of a simulation as I would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;against the claim that you &quot;owned&quot; the proteins making up a sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you claimed was your &quot;slave&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right.  Our old argument.  And one can see how it comes down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a difference in how societies of equals should function.
</em><br>
<p>No, it comes down to a difference in who we consider an &quot;equal&quot;.  Lee, I 
<br>
see absolutely no difference between claiming to own someone's proteins 
<br>
and claiming to own their hardware.  People are patterns in physics, 
<br>
period.  I don't care what level of abstraction you think they're on; to 
<br>
me, they're just people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you acknowledge the harm of preventing people from running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely numerous simulations, and thus granting run time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps trillions of happy people, because of restrictive laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and interventions by outsiders?  (Of course *I* admit that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a vanishingly few of these simulations, unspeakable horrors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur---but that's true in the hell branches of MWI already.)
</em><br>
<p>An interesting question.  I doubt I shall ever be confronted with it in 
<br>
practice, as I see no moral purpose that would *ever* call for 
<br>
&quot;simulations&quot; rather than &quot;citizens&quot; - the only thing you can do with a 
<br>
&quot;simulation&quot;, as you advocate that legal status, which cannot be done with 
<br>
a &quot;citizen&quot;, as I advocate that legal status, is violate the simulation's 
<br>
volition.  Why should there be trillions of simulations rather than 
<br>
trillions of citizens?
<br>
<p>But, given your strange hypothetical question, I guess my answer would be 
<br>
that I don't really know given my current morality - it would depend 
<br>
whether I thought the good of those trillions outweighed the hell 
<br>
branches.  If the universe is infinite, I might think that having a clean 
<br>
universe with aleph-null happy people distributed several trillion to a 
<br>
causal volume is better than a universe with aleph-null happy people and 
<br>
aleph-null unhappy people distributed several quadrillion to a causal 
<br>
volume, even if the relative proportion of unhappy to happy people is low.
<br>
<p>Would you suddenly turn around and consider intervention to be your 
<br>
business if the majority of simulations were shaping up as hell worlds?  I 
<br>
didn't think that was your argument at all.  I thought it was just none of 
<br>
your business.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, &quot;but that awful thing already happens under MWI&quot; is a fully 
<br>
general and rather silly argument; fully general in that it can be used to 
<br>
excuse absolutely anything; rather silly, in that it wipes out all moral 
<br>
differentials if it succeeds, but fails the instant you consider the 
<br>
relative frequency of an event as morally relevant.
