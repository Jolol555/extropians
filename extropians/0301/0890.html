<em>&gt;     &gt; The only two places?  What about from 10km with a B747 ABL,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; the airborne laser?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That might work very well against short range scuds and would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helpful in the 91 gulf war, but it's of no use against a ICBM because Russia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't let you fly your 747 around Siberia 10 km from the launch point.
</em><br>
<p>Russia isn't the problem.  China isn't the problem.
<br>
Terrorists are the problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   &gt; would  give the attacker some real headaches, especially considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; he knows he only has 35 minutes to live after squeezing off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; a missile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?
</em><br>
<p>We will fire back if fired upon.  The shooter might
<br>
as well fire everything he has simultaneously
<br>
because he gets only one chance.  35 minutes is about
<br>
how long it takes for targetting and return fire.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; Missile defense is certainly a difficult problem, but we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; should not declare it impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As long as it take a dollar's worth of defensive hardware to shoot down 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cents worth of offensive hardware a practical ICBM defense will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible and I don't see that changing anytime soon because shooting down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a ICBM is fundamentally more difficult that sending a ICBM.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but the shooter gets only one shot.
<br>
Nuclear submarines put the AD in MAD.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; the Muslim extremists would be tempted to  deliver a nuke by missile
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;if at all possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't imagine why they would want to go to all the trouble of delivering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their nuke by missile when they could send it by Federal Express.
</em><br>
<p>The terrorists use a missile in the fond hope of
<br>
blaming the Russians, so that a TN shootout is
<br>
triggered.  Granted it probably wouldn't work,
<br>
for the US has invested in sophisiticated means
<br>
to detect the source of a missile launch.
<br>
<p>What concerns me is that Russia hasn't invested
<br>
in parallel technology, so the terrorists use
<br>
the option of dropping a nuclear missile on
<br>
Moscow.  Boris doesn't know for sure who fired
<br>
it, but in brutal desperation, retaliates against
<br>
New York.  Europeans are drawn into the unspeakable
<br>
horror, and two hours later most of the world's
<br>
population is either dead or sincerely wishing
<br>
they were.
<br>
<p>The Muslim extremists see their opportunity to
<br>
cleanse the sinful planet.  They cheerfully seize
<br>
this opportunity.  This nightmare scenario is
<br>
shaping military strategy.
