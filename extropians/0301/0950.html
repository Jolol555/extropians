<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Who actually has the power now ... to *actually*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; decide who gets to make these decisions in society? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's a deep question.  My suggested answer is that we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decide, both individually and collectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok. But is the question important? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, in your view, do you think it would be useful for us to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, to identify, who *actually* has the power to decide the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;level at which different decisions occur in our society [that are]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucial to society's well-being&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>You asked it; I presumed it was an important question!  ;-)
<br>
<p>Seriously, yes, it's one of those things that the electorate
<br>
in a democratic republic has to keep an eye on.  I.e., who is
<br>
it that is really making the decisions---and this feeds right
<br>
into my point that the decisions should usually be made at
<br>
the lowest feasible level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So in this way, the hands of the legislators are presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tied.  So, in summary, we would have to add to your list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     legislators and representatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     voters and electors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   * ideas and memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   * constitutional guarantees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's interesting but I think that the additions you make would not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normally be considered &quot;who's&quot; in the question &quot;who decides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who decides&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, while I shall defend memes as entities, below, I do
<br>
recognize that your objection here is quite proper.  You
<br>
had asked &quot;who&quot;, not what.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would agree that memes can influence decisive agents such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  But do you think memes become decisive agents in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves? 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From reading &quot;The Meme Machine&quot;, by Susan Blackmore, I
</em><br>
concluded that to describe human actions as actions by
<br>
memes is correct, but is not always either illuminating
<br>
or necessary.  It's as though you're using a different
<br>
coordinate system to describe the same phenomena.  On
<br>
some occasions, however, the meme-way-of-looking-at-it
<br>
is more desirable.
<br>
<p>Concretely, yes, memes are often decisive agents!  This
<br>
is because sometimes the best explanation has to do with
<br>
the way a virulent virus-like idea spreads through a
<br>
population with drastic consequences.  It's at those
<br>
moments one wonders whether the memes are the ultimate
<br>
causal agents, or the humans.  (Of course, as I explained
<br>
in the previous paragraph, that's not a good thing to 
<br>
wonder.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems that we are in agreement that it is the constitution and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislation that codifies the legal rights people have and therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; codifies who actually gets to decide particular things at particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels.   
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wouldn't you say that laws and constitutional guarantees are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; codifications rather than decisive agents in themselves? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I guess so.  When a legislator or executive is hauled up
<br>
short on some intended action by the existence of a strongly
<br>
worded codification to the contrary, a minor miracle has just
<br>
happened.  As Anders wrote today in another thread
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with building liberal democracies is that it is not just 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about writing a nice constitution but to get institutions to actually 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respect the rights set down therein.  It is about the same problem as 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hernando de Soto described about bootstrapping a market economy: if the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;culture and institutions are not right, it won't work outside small 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sectors.  You need to set up the culture and institutions that act as 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checks and balances, and this can't be done overnight and must be done 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while building the rest of the constitutional system.
<br>
<p>But when the culture is right, these legislators and executives
<br>
are &quot;controlled&quot; by the statutes and codified prohibitions.  It
<br>
really is in a way as though the constitutional provision is an
<br>
&quot;active agent&quot;.  Doesn't it seem so, in a way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems we can't really appeal to memes or constitutions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change themselves. I suspect that whilst your additions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the list make sense if the question was &quot;what are some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that influence who decides who decides&quot; but I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so sure that they add any further active agents.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, all that's true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems like constitutional guarantees are interpreted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforced and even occasionally formulated and codified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but they are not actually consulted. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, in a way they are consulted, aren't they?  ;-)  I mean,
<br>
especially if they are so numerous and detailed (e.g. laws)
<br>
that someone must consult them to ponder the exact meaning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I reckon we can reduce the domain of &quot;who decides who decides&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely to &quot;sentient agents&quot;. To actual people. Wouldn't you agree? 
</em><br>
<p>Sure, that's a good question too.  Perhaps, as I said, more
<br>
proper than the one I had substituted for it.
