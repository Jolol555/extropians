<br>
<p>This is interesting.
<br>
<p>Eight leaders of European countries call for unity between Europe and
<br>
America in dealing with Iraq, in a full-page editorial in today's London
<br>
Times.
<br>
<p>The countries are Spain, Portugal, Italy, Britain, Czech Republic, Hungary,
<br>
Poland and Denmark.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that their combined economic growth last year was more than
<br>
twice that of France and Germany.  Perhaps this is Rummie's &quot;New Europe.&quot;
<br>
Although Rummy's an idiot shooting off his mouth like that.
<br>
<p>The point being: we can't group the Europeans all together into one
<br>
anti-American, pro-Franco-German alliance. Much of them are closer to US
<br>
policy than they are to Germany and France. Schroder is very unpopular in
<br>
Germany; Chirac was elected, we should remember, because the only other
<br>
option was LePen, a nazi. It's interesting to note that mainland Europa has
<br>
no real strong, clear leadership right now. Could be that its Blair, of all
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>It isn't a given that Europe will unite behind Germany and France. Far from
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Just an observation.

<p><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-559907,00.html">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-559907,00.html</a>
<br>
<p><p><p>THE real bond between the United States and Europe is the values we share:
<br>
democracy, individual freedom, human rights and the Rule of Law. These
<br>
values crossed the Atlantic with those who sailed from Europe to help create
<br>
the USA. Today they are under greater threat than ever.
<br>
<p>The attacks of 11 September showed just how far terrorists ‹ the enemies of
<br>
our common values ‹ are prepared to go to destroy them. Those outrages were
<br>
an attack on all of us. In standing firm in defence of these principles, the
<br>
governments and people of the United States and Europe have amply
<br>
demonstrated the strength of their convictions. Today more than ever, the
<br>
transatlantic bond is a guarantee of our freedom.
<br>
<p>We in Europe have a relationship with the United States which has stood the
<br>
test of time. Thanks in large part to American bravery, generosity and
<br>
far-sightedness, Europe was set free from the two forms of tyranny that
<br>
devastated our continent in the 20th century: Nazism and Communism. Thanks,
<br>
too, to the continued cooperation between Europe and the United States we
<br>
have managed to guarantee peace and freedom on our continent. The
<br>
transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the current Iraqi
<br>
regime¹s persistent attempts to threaten world security.
<br>
<p>In today¹s world, more than ever before, it is vital that we preserve that
<br>
unity and cohesion. We know that success in the day-to-day battle against
<br>
terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction demands
<br>
unwavering determination and firm international cohesion on the part of all
<br>
countries for whom freedom is precious.
<br>
<p>The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear
<br>
threat to world security. This danger has been explicitly recognised by the
<br>
United Nations. All of us are bound by Security Council Resolution 1441,
<br>
which was adopted unanimously. We Europeans have since reiterated our
<br>
backing for Resolution 1441, our wish to pursue the UN route and our support
<br>
for the Security Council, at the Prague Nato Summit and the Copenhagen
<br>
European Council.
<br>
<p>In doing so, we sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message that we would rid
<br>
the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein¹s weapons of mass
<br>
destruction. We must remain united in insisting that his regime is disarmed.
<br>
The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community
<br>
are our best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies in unity.
<br>
<p>The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism is a threat of
<br>
incalculable consequences. It is one at which all of us should feel
<br>
concerned. Resolution 1441 is Saddam Hussein¹s last chance to disarm using
<br>
peaceful means. The opportunity to avoid greater confrontation rests with
<br>
him. Sadly this week the UN weapons inspectors have confirmed that his
<br>
long-established pattern of deception, denial and non-compliance with UN
<br>
Security Council resolutions is continuing.
<br>
<p>Europe has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, they are the first
<br>
victims of Iraq¹s current brutal regime. Our goal is to safeguard world
<br>
peace and security by ensuring that this regime gives up its weapons of mass
<br>
destruction. Our governments have a common responsibility to face this
<br>
threat. Failure to do so would be nothing less than negligent to our own
<br>
citizens and to the wider world.
<br>
<p>The United Nations Charter charges the Security Council with the task of
<br>
preserving international peace and security. To do so, the Security Council
<br>
must maintain its credibility by ensuring full compliance with its
<br>
resolutions. We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those
<br>
Resolutions. If they are not complied with, the Security Council will lose
<br>
its credibility and world peace will suffer as a result.
<br>
<p>We are confident that the Security Council will face up to its
<br>
responsibilities.
