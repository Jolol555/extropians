MMB declaimed:
<br>
&lt;&lt; Relevant to the recent Ir*q threads...
<br>
&quot;...lately it seems as though a lot of otherwise sober people on
<br>
  both continents are becoming unhinged.&quot;
<br>
Umm, yeah. What he said. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The center does not hold, it something or others..W.B. Yeats
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The real issue is that Europeans feel they have not been accorded the power 
<br>
they
<br>
deserve in the international arena, while Americans largely feel that Europe
<br>
is freeloading off US military might. That is what makes the Euro-American
<br>
duel so nasty.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Its surely not the only reason, because there are different financial and 
<br>
social interests at stake. Europeans and Americans have been feeling this way 
<br>
since the mid 1950s. Many Europeans, including the British, were concerned 
<br>
then, that we would involve them in a nuclear war between the US &amp; the USSR.  
<br>
Also, the Europeans have considered the Americans as &quot;naive&quot; or 
<br>
unsophisticated,  and inexperienced in &quot;statecraft&quot; and governance.
<br>
<p>I don't think papering over our differences is useful to the citizens of the 
<br>
US, and therefore believe that the US should, in the next few years, reassess 
<br>
its political, military, and economic ties to Europe. Conversely, the 
<br>
Europeans, if they have not already, should do the same and reformulate the 
<br>
equation, for a more stable world.
<br>
<p>In doing so, we at least can reduce the surprise factor in world politics. 
<br>
Surprise factors are almost never beneficial,  like Sarajevo, in 1914.
