-----Original Message-----
<br>
Various comments in this thread...
<br>
<p>&quot;I recommend obtaining DNA from the highest IQ people in the world. Then
<br>
solicit scientists as volunteers to each adopt one of these clones and agree
<br>
to raise them as their own.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The papers I mentioned demonstrated that even 100% heritability of
<br>
intelligence is swamped by the other factors. Cloning doesn't matter
<br>
in this respect. &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes. And then it becomes a matter of where to place your money. On 20
<br>
extremely expensive children or 2000 potential children?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;If you want to accelerate the singularity, isn't it more cost-efficient to
<br>
find ways of bringing extra stimulation to the already existing kids that
<br>
have good potential but too little stimulation?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------
<br>
<p>There are plenty of great kids and people with great potential out there.
<br>
For starters, all the kids out there waiting for adoption. I have heard it a
<br>
few times on this list someone asking for a single good reason to have
<br>
children, it seems that making them more likely to contribute to the global
<br>
standard of living might be a good one.  Religions employ this tactic
<br>
unshamefully, mormons have as many kids as possible for the sole reason that
<br>
its far more likely someone will become mormon if you indoctrine them from
<br>
birth.  However, it seems extropians wouldn't care all to much for the
<br>
arbitrary propogation of any particular genes, but instead value the
<br>
propogation of valuable memes.  Memes such as creativity, logic, reasoning,
<br>
motivation, curiousity, etc. etc.  It seems that the more people out there
<br>
that have such memes the better we will all be.  So right now there are
<br>
thousands of kids jumping from foster home to foster home from terrible home
<br>
life to another terrible homelife.  Everyone of which has some amazing
<br>
potential to be the next Bill Gates, Tesla, Eisntein, Dali, or Beethoven.
<br>
Instead of cloning established scientists, lets adopt and teach kids from
<br>
the youngest possible age what we value and why.  A school of transhumanism
<br>
would be nice as well.   Secondly, there are plenty of other people, adults
<br>
and children, living in terrible conditions throghout the world, typically
<br>
under corrupt despotic dictators.  Doing what we can to open them up to
<br>
eductation, progress, and development would be a positive step forward as
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>Just my 2c
<br>
