<p><p><em>&gt; You agree to open the shutter at 8 pm on the day of the next Lotto draw iff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the winning numbers are 3, 15, 27, 28, 31 and 45.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it the case that in those universes where this number set doesn't win,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of you will all see punctate recordings on the detector, while in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the n million fewer universes where it *does* win, you'll all see an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference fringe? Or does the presence of a closed shutter in most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes obliterate interference in *all* worlds?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the 1 in n million test universes where fringes do show, you'll invest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a ticket and be rich the next day. Better than *none* of you winning...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (As I recall, the mere possibility of closing the shutter forces the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-interference, but maybe that gets finessed in this approach?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What about the effect of the n million universes where you chose different 
<br>
numbers? These would out weigh universes with the same numbers by 14.7 
<br>
million x n. give or take a bit. Could we take this into account in the 
<br>
design? maybe shift the location of the device according to the set of 
<br>
numbers we choose, or would this throw yet more spanners in the equation?
<br>
<p>This is similar to another half baked idea I had some years ago. I first 
<br>
heard of quantum tunnelling from an experiment using an emitter, a blocking 
<br>
device and a receiver. As usual the details evade my well oiled sieve like 
<br>
memory. 
<br>
the result of the experiment was that particles that should have been 
<br>
blocked, were received as some had tunnelled through the blocking device. 
<br>
Interestingly, these particles were allegedly received fractionally before 
<br>
they were transmitted.
<br>
It made me wonder if you could run x number of these devices in series. After 
<br>
each detection, you amplify the signal and transmit to the next receiver. If 
<br>
enough of these were used, you could send yourself the lottery results.
