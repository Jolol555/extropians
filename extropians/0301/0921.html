</em><br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>I'm glad that at least one other person has noted a similar 
<br>
pattern. 
<br>
<p>I'd not read the thread on the Lomborg debate but following
<br>
the mention of it (above), I did. 
<br>
<p>The Lomborg debate provides just one example of where a 
<br>
choice was made to frame the discourse in terms of &quot;point 
<br>
scoring over the opponent&quot; rather than, framing it in terms of 
<br>
&quot;seeking a deeper understanding&quot;.
<br>
<p>This choice, either to pursue &quot;point scoring&quot; or to pursue
<br>
&quot;deeper understanding&quot; seems available to each of us each
<br>
&nbsp;time we post.
<br>
<p>Yet it seems that there are STRUCTURAL aspects of a list 
<br>
such as this, that make it hard for people to keep in mind, 
<br>
both that they HAVE this choice and that there are REAL 
<br>
consequences in how the choice is exercised 
<br>
<p>First, RUDENESS, perceived or actual, intended or not, 
<br>
enkindles a strong desire to respond that may not be just
<br>
emotional, but may have some intellectual basis - in the 
<br>
principle of &quot;tit for tat&quot;.
<br>
<p>Second, quite naturally, people perceive and respond 
<br>
negatively not just to BLATANT personal attacks but also 
<br>
to the subtler varieties. Ad hominem, or at least the essence 
<br>
of it, can be packaged into sophisticated forms. The use of
<br>
insinuation and innuendo; selective excerpting; misleading
<br>
paraphrasing; even in the formulation of questions that are 
<br>
structured not to elicit discussion or serious consideration
<br>
but that are leading and that invite the other to impale or 
<br>
ensnare themselves.
<br>
<p>When this occurs, I think it is a shame.  I feel fairly certain
<br>
that NONE of the frequent posters to this list are 
<br>
ACTUALLY as jaded, closed or cynical as some of their
<br>
postings could be taken to suggest.
<br>
<p>That SOME, &quot;people seem to think that it is better to debate
<br>
now and learn later is something I'd also noticed.
<br>
<p>Ridicule CAN be an effective tools in SOME forms of
<br>
debate, but it's use invites an IN-kind response and soon, it
<br>
is difficult for either party to change tack and for genuinely
<br>
open questions to be asked. Passions inflamed are not
<br>
easily dowsed. Subtle slights and put downs are remembered. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Once the choice is made by someone to approach a topic
<br>
with a debating mindset, rather than with a view to getting 
<br>
deeper understanding for mutual empowerment, then, FROM
<br>
THAT POINT ON, it is VERY difficult for anything other 
<br>
than the debating mindset to set the agenda. Once adopted,
<br>
the debating mindset is EASIER, QUICKER and becomes
<br>
SELF REINFORCING.
<br>
<p>The structure of an electronic list itself seems to afford intrinsic 
<br>
advantages to the debating or 'point scoring' mindset at the 
<br>
expense of the mindset aimed at pursuing deeper understanding
<br>
towards mutual empowerment. 
<br>
<p>Its seems ironic that it may be precisely because so much genuine
<br>
good will and real interest in developing deeper understandings
<br>
exists on the ExI list, that a person primarily wishing to use the 
<br>
list to practice their debating skill may find it such a useful 'arena'
<br>
for doing so. 
<br>
<p>It seems an original or initiating post, however carefully prepared,
<br>
to try and seek deeper understanding of an issue can be used as 
<br>
launching pad by any would-be debater. 
<br>
<p>The opportunity to selectively excerpt affords a ready means 
<br>
of changing the frame of reference to that which is more
<br>
suitable to the practice-debater's knowledge base. They need
<br>
only select any detail, however incidental to the original thrust 
<br>
and reset the frame of reference to grounds more convenient to
<br>
the development and display of their debating skill.
<br>
<p>Yet, I do not think there is ANYONE who frequently posts
<br>
to this list who could neatly or fairly be categorised as ONLY  
<br>
interested in practicing their debating skills, or as only interested
<br>
in pursuing and fostering deeper understanding. Indeed, the two
<br>
approaches can be adopted at different times by the same person,
<br>
and imo, sometimes, even by the same person at different points in
<br>
the one post. 
<br>
<p>This creates a dilemma. A person who frequently adopts a
<br>
practice-debating mindset may be a pest in some circumstances
<br>
but cannot safely or fairly be ignored or dismissed as such. 
<br>
<p>Debating and debating skills WITHIN a structure DO serve a
<br>
useful purpose and are RIGHTFULLY respected. And even the
<br>
most enthusiast practice-debaters on the ExI list are sometimes,
<br>
also open minded questioners seeking to really deepen 
<br>
understanding. 
<br>
<p>As a longer time reader and shorter time poster, I suspect that
<br>
in some cases I may have erred and left UNanswered some 
<br>
questions that were asked, at least partially, in good faith.
<br>
It is often hard to SEE an open, or partially open question, for 
<br>
what it is, when it comes surrounded in debating rhetoric and 
<br>
bundled with what seem to be cheap shots.
<br>
<p>It seems ignoring a perceived practice-debater in full rhetorical
<br>
and acerbic flight can be a mistake that has twofold negative 
<br>
consequences. Not only does the sometimes practice-debater's
<br>
good faith questions go unanswered, but also other readers, 
<br>
may misinterpret any non-response as an inability to respond.
<br>
Silence or restraint can be perceived as vanquishment.
<br>
<p>Thus there seems to be a dilemma. The very STRUCTURE of
<br>
a list such as this favours the success, at least in the short term,
<br>
and possibly indefinitely, of the debater-mindset over the 
<br>
seeking-to-understand-and-empower-to-action mindset. We 
<br>
can and do make real progress on understanding issues but the
<br>
rate of progress seems less than each of us would probably 
<br>
like it to be. Especially if we hold that increased understanding
<br>
leads to greater power to effect positive change.  
<br>
<p>I suspect I can hardly be the first one to have encountered 
<br>
this paradox. Indeed, I wonder if many are drawn in frustration,
<br>
into the &quot;point scoring&quot; practice-debater mindset far more often
<br>
than they would wish. 
<br>
<p>Intellectually, most of us are well aware of the imprudence of
<br>
fighting with each other when &quot;we are standing in a burning 
<br>
house&quot;. (i.e.. The default human condition IS mortal and I think
<br>
few if any would dispute that the overriding of that condition,
<br>
sooner rather than later, will require the concerted effort of 
<br>
people so oriented).
<br>
<p>Yet, it remains hard to let 'cheap shots' at ones expense pass
<br>
unresponded, and further, if ignoring a cheap shot or leaving
<br>
unchallenged a specious argument seems to gives the poster
<br>
making the cheap shot or specious argument an apparent 
<br>
victory, then it would seem that even the 'virtue' of restraint is
<br>
doubtful. Indeed restraint may see lesser motives and baser
<br>
behavior go unpunished and the list may be overwhelmed not
<br>
be the more thoughtful posts but by the more noisy and puerile
<br>
postings. And probably none of us would want this as an
<br>
object.
<br>
<p>I think I am beginning to understand why some of the more
<br>
thoughtful posters post less often. Its not that they have reached
<br>
the limits of what they could useful say, so much, as they reach
<br>
the limits of how much time they have to defend what they say
<br>
from the practice-debater mindset. They see, perhaps, that the 
<br>
forum will necessarily become an arena.  
<br>
<p>I agree with the comment (above) that it is not human nature
<br>
per se that works against us on this list. But I think some aspects
<br>
of 'human nature' and not the better aspects, imo, are more able
<br>
to find expression due to the very structure of the list.
<br>
<p>If my observations are sound, then it seems that there is an upper
<br>
limit on how consistently &quot;nice&quot; &quot;courteous&quot; or tolerant one can
<br>
afford to be in one's behavior on a list without ultimately rendering
<br>
both oneself and the list the worse for one's restraint.
<br>
<p>Intrinsic to the structure of a list is that casual readers as well as
<br>
practice-debaters may pop in and out of a thread, without
<br>
ever seriously engaging. Yet one cannot afford to leave even
<br>
the most specious argument or the cheapest shot unaddressed,
<br>
lest the final impression left on the mind of the casual reader is
<br>
that some deep fallacy has been exposed. This seems to feed
<br>
into the debating principle of it never being prudent to leave
<br>
even a specious argument or a ad hominem go unchecked lest
<br>
they be mistakenly be perceived as substantive by the audience.
<br>
<p>The structure of the list seems to place disproportionate power
<br>
in the hands of the most recent poster to a thread. It is the most 
<br>
recent poster that a casual reader is likely to read. And if it
<br>
happens to that the most recent post (perhaps because it is 
<br>
quicker to prepare and easier to shoot of) contains biased 
<br>
excerpting, ad hominem or cheap shots then the casual reader
<br>
seems quite likely to take that post as indicative of the content 
<br>
and theme of the thread. Mud thrown easily, sticks, and is not
<br>
so easily removed. 
<br>
<p>So its not human nature that the problem, and we don't need a
<br>
better class of poster what we need are non-stick posts :-)
<br>
<p>Not all of the most valuable and empowering insights will appear
<br>
to everyone to be that on first blush. If they did they could hardly
<br>
be insights. It could be that quite a number of threads that are
<br>
initiated and appear to be of no obvious consequence to most,
<br>
might in fact, if allowed to develop in a spirit of seeking deeper 
<br>
understanding have profound and empowering consequences.
<br>
<p>Perhaps, as we are mortal, we poop in each others posts at our
<br>
peril, yet as we are mortal, we must work within the constrains
<br>
of a forum, and so we refrain from reciprocity at our even 
<br>
greater peril.
<br>
<p>I am reminded of a quote by George Bush Senior.
<br>
<p>&quot;I would have been kind and gentle. I would still be kind.
<br>
But I am considering how gentle I will be&quot;.
<br>
<p>Original sin? Nah. But the &quot;human predicament&quot; perhaps.
