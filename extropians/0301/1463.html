&lt;&lt;The greatest spin-off from the military is technology.  The key is to keep 
<br>
the
<br>
resources allocated to military funded technology focused to development and 
<br>
testing
<br>
with the commercialization phase done in the private sector.
<br>
EX-GPS.  The civilian system now uses  military developed  technology.  I 
<br>
suspect
<br>
that a completely private venture capital R&amp;D and deployment, debugging 
<br>
program
<br>
would never have had enough cash flow to become reality.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yeah, GPS is one of the suprises of our age. Or, rather, what use we make of 
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;There is no need for Europe to try to copy the USA in a military sense.  
<br>
Someone has to be the brains that keeps the brawn from blowing itself and 
<br>
everyone else to
<br>
kingdom come.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Are you sure that Europe has the lions share of intellectual capacity?  The 
<br>
decisions they make for themselves sometimes seem very short-sighted to me.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The USA embodies some of the best and worst of humanity.  The key is 
<br>
balancing each and focusing towards useful goals.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is America's perceived penchant for risk? &quot;He who dares-wins!&quot; 
<br>
But not always. Ah! Strong, the dark side, is in you..yes!  Sorry.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Japan , Canada and Europe have been able to create better average standards 
<br>
of
<br>
living for their citizens than the USA.  That has been the peace dividend.  
<br>
The USA
<br>
has a disproportionately higher empoverished class than the  EU, Canada or 
<br>
Japan.
<br>
Socialism may squander resources on social programs but infant mortality in 
<br>
Canada
<br>
is 7/10,000  VS Iraq @ 210/10,000.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, in my own, typically, arrogant, American way; allow me to suggest that 
<br>
the aforementioned societies you have listed, benefit, in large part, from 
<br>
the US taxpayer footing the bill for a huge chuck of their security. :-)  I 
<br>
mean, one can't afford socialized medicine, top of the line education, and 
<br>
keep the Russian Bear (of Soviet vintage) and the Chinese dragon at bay.  Or 
<br>
rather we might, but that also would entail (me thinks) raising tariffs, and 
<br>
becoming Festung American (fortress).
<br>
To do that, it would take more unity of purpose then the US has, so far, 
<br>
exhibited.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;For this attitude, we too get the USA pissed off at us occaisionally.  The 
<br>
aide to
<br>
our Prime Minister called Bush a moron.  I'm sure they think we do some 
<br>
idiotic
<br>
things too. Life goes on.
<br>
..MJ &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Not to defend W, but from my point of view Chretien is surely, no mental 
<br>
wizard. I am not sure that his leadership even provides good governance for 
<br>
Canada, but I will let you decide.
