Damien noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt; According to Agence France Presse and the Associated Press, the following
<br>
changes in dead &amp; missing foreign citizens, dual nationals, resident aliens,
<br>
and undocumented immigrants (upward and downward estimates in parentheses)
<br>
have been reported as of 21 September: Out of 6333 reported missing by Mayor
<br>
Giuliani, 3870 are foreigners, 2463 are U.S. citizens. 20 September 2001. &gt;
<br>
The attack was on our entire civilization, Mitch, not just on American
<br>
citizens. We all have a stake in this.
<br>
Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The thing to think about, I suggest, is that even those places which may have 
<br>
lost a hundred ciitzens,  it is treated as &quot;America's problem.&quot; I would argue 
<br>
that most of the world, including the present administarion, has been &quot;soft 
<br>
on wahabbism&quot;, to parapharse Dicky Nixon. If one cannot address Islamic 
<br>
Militancy, as a prime threat, then the problem may indeed worsen. Right now W 
<br>
Bushes comming invasion of Iraq seems the only game in town, because frankly, 
<br>
nobody else is leading. 
<br>
<p>For example, both France and Russia are courting Iraq and the Arab world, 
<br>
while bemoaning Islamist attacks on their homelands. Surely, this hypocrisy 
<br>
should not stand. They think that they can dance at two weddings at the same 
<br>
time, but they can't.
<br>
<p>So who is to avenge those slain on 9-11, and prevent future murderers from 
<br>
having their way? Little old us, the US.  Arrogantly put, but whom are we 
<br>
going to depend on for help, the Mongolians?
