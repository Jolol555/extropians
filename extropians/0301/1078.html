U.S. history, see:

<p>It is worth noting that the death toll (254 seamen)
<br>
were an order of magnitude less than the death toll
<br>
of *civilians* in 911.
<br>
<p>I'm not going to try to justify the current U.S.
<br>
policy with respect to Iraq (or North Korea).
<br>
Because I'm not sure they can be presented in
<br>
a rational manner.  But Spike's recent note on
<br>
nuclear weapons propagation and use raises the
<br>
red flag.
<br>
<p>Precisely how bad do things have to get before
<br>
one says &quot;you may not cross this line&quot;?  And
<br>
then are you willing to suffer the consequences
<br>
of allowing things to have gotten to that point?
<br>
<p>As much as I may not (currently) be fond of utilitarian
<br>
arguments I think I am being forced into the position of
<br>
rationalizing and justifying them.
<br>
<p>To remove the debate from it current &quot;political&quot; climate,
<br>
how on earth could we have allowed the genocide of over
<br>
a million people in Rwanda?

<p>The non-U.S. members of the extropian list don't get
<br>
to beg off on this because the U.N. provides, if anything,
<br>
a forum for third parties to raise voices of concern and
<br>
outrage.  [Where were you?]
<br>
<p>So, I would urge all people who consider themselves
<br>
&quot;extropic&quot; to consider long and hard the question of
<br>
when their arguments and efforts really are likely
<br>
to save or produce the greatest amount of information
<br>
(i.e. are most anti-entropic).
<br>
<p>This isn't about being &quot;right&quot;, it isn't about advancing
<br>
ones own political perspective (the entire libertarian
<br>
vs. some other political framework fades and exits stage
<br>
left in this forum), it isn't about whether having or
<br>
not having guns is a way to move forward a perspective.
<br>
It is about whether or not the information content that we,
<br>
as a species and civilization, have accumulated, is maintained
<br>
and hopefully evolved.
<br>
<p>That is what &quot;EXTROPY&quot; is about.
