### I reviewed the following article:  Doody RS. Geldmacher DS. Gordon B.
<br>
Perdomo CA. Pratt RD. Donepezil Study Group. Open-label, multicenter, phase
<br>
3 extension study of the safety and efficacy of donepezil in patients with
<br>
Alzheimer disease. Archives of Neurology. 58(3):427-33, 2001, which to my
<br>
knowledge is the longest trial of efficacy and safety of an AChE inhibitor.
<br>
<p>The very long course of the cognitive decline on donepezil, which closely
<br>
parallels natural course of the disease, makes it unlikely that induction of
<br>
changes in neurotransmitter synthesis could be the cause. Most neurochemical
<br>
responses to drugs take place over hours to weeks, here we have a steady
<br>
decline over a period of two years. The rate of decline is essentially
<br>
identical for treated and placebo groups in the shorter double-blind
<br>
studies, and not substantially different from natural progression of the
<br>
disease in historical controls (this is a very weak datapoint).
<br>
<p>The most likely explanation is that donepezil (and other AChE inhibitors,
<br>
like galantamine, and rivastigmine) do not affect the underlying disease
<br>
process and provide strictly symptomatic relief.
<br>
<p>This said, I would not recommend sustained use of AChE inhibitors in healthy
<br>
persons, except on a temporary basis. Their safety has not been tested in
<br>
long-term studies on healthy volunteers. If there are adventurous spirits
<br>
willing to expose their brains to some (probably small) risk for the sake of
<br>
clearer thinking, I wish we could track their progress over a few years.
