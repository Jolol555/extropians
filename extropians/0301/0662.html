A distributed international library - that's a very cool idea. I'd
<br>
contribute access to my admittedly small technical library.
<br>
<p>It needs a website for organisational purposes, so people can request books,
<br>
or find out what's available and the status of books (available, borrowed,
<br>
etc).
<br>
<p>In the context that dead trees are the only way to legally get your hands on
<br>
a lot of important information, this is a spectacularly extropian idea. EXI
<br>
would do well to at least host the site.

<em>&gt; Subject: The ExI Lending Library [was: book availability and cost]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nathanael wrote an interesting comment about the cost of books.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The local libraries don't have any of the books I've been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to get. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't have the extra cash to constantly buy books at like $20-$30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a piece. If anyone has any other solution to this email me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was wandering if anyone has a bunch of books sitting on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shelf somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they would get rid of at a reasonable price.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This, and perhaps Anders' comments on altruism, started me thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course one of the barriers to transhumanistic development is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of access to the resources required to develop thinking in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these areas.  After all, look at what was required to spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;religions&quot; (*not* that I am comparing Extropianism or Transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;religions&quot;).  It required widespread availability of books like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Bible or the Koran.  [One could probably counter-argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catholicism and/or Islam were spread mostly by the &quot;keepers of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith&quot;, but for this discussion lets assume that having access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the word&quot; promotes its dissemination.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, most town or city libraries are going to have relatively few of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the works we consider important (see for example many of the books
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the ExI reading list or my personal reading list).  University
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libraries may be somewhat better, but many fewer people have access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them.  It would be a highly interesting exercise to determine what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of perhaps several thousand college or university libraries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the U.S. have copies of either Nanosystems or Nanomedicine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Someone who considers themself a hot-shot programmer, could whip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up a perl script that could query all of the online catalogs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer this question and *really* impress me!].  Now I happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own 3 and 2 copies of these books respectively, though 1 copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each happens to be in Moscow where I don't have easy access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them currently.  But the point remains that I have copies of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic/transhumanist books, some read, some unread, that I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more than happy to share on a temporary basis if the costs can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be made low enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enter [stage left] National and International ExI Lending Libraries...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I am thinking is something like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We try to develop a system that strikes a balance between the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are resource (e.g. book) rich, but time poor with the people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are relatively cost constrained but time rich.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a lot of books (really more than most people can imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantities of books).  Many of these are elements of the extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading list, others are scientific &amp; technical as well as college
</em><br>
<em>&gt; textbooks (unfortunately it would probably take weeks for me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a complete online list).  In addition, at least in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a 4th class book shipment rate that is relatively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inexpensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Books don't ship fast, but they get there eventually.  Finally, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I send and receive most of my mail via a P.O. Box (a very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for people prominent in the extropic/transhumanist community who think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is even a slight chance that they might become targets for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loony-toons luddite who can get their home mailing address out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily accessed credit records).  So I'm frequently at the post office
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and picking something up or dropping something off isn't a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional [time] cost to me (at least while I continue to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in Seattle).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, how would this work?  It looks to me like someone who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to borrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a book, should:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) be willing to pay the postage (to send/receive the book).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) probably be willing to send a &quot;sticky&quot; mailing label with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the request
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    for a book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) agree to a period for the book &quot;loan&quot; (1-2 months perhaps based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    book page count/technical difficulty?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; d) agree to pay fines to ExI if they do not return the book on time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    ($0.10/day?).  [Without negative consequences some of us may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    behave properly.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, the interesting thing about this is that I suspect without too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much difficulty, it ought to be possible to develop a distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lending library system.  The only thing I see as potentially difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is lowering international shipping costs/bureaucracy such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible to do this across country borders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, one of the interesting things about this, that might have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed, is the fact that one may receive the high-lighting, margin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notes, etc. of the owner of the circulating copy of a text.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the problem of how one contributes to this.  What I have read of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greg Stock's &quot;Redesigining Humans&quot; was in the copy Carol Tilly loaned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.  I had to read it with an extra pad where I could note pages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and comments such as -- no/wrong/short-sighted/etc. to avoid defacing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Carol's copy.  But I would like to think that some people would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in what I think is important in a text -- at the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be fascinated by comments that Anders, Damien, Max, Greg, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robin, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make on a text (since their perspectives are quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orthogonal to mine).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously this gets problematic after a text has been sent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out 10+ times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Normal &quot;reviews&quot; don't cut the mustard.  You have to be able to delve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down into the specific points of an argument and point out precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *where* it is on swampy ground.  Reading an article or book 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so annotated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is *much* more educational.  It raises the interesting question as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to whether the extropic/transhumanist vector should be to read a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;virginal&quot; book or an &quot;annotated&quot; book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not know if the implementation of something like this is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do know I'm willing to help explore it if others are.
</em><br>
