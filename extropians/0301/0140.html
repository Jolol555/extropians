Lee Corbin asks, in another thread,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is bad about Dolly's arthritis?  Who is it bad for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would it have been better for Dolly if cloning had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forbidden?  Would Dolly be better off dead?
</em><br>
<p>These are very good questions, which go to the heart of the cloning
<br>
issue and a number of other related subjects.  Under what circumstances
<br>
should we feel justified in bringing a child into the world?  How should
<br>
we balance risks and rewards for an unborn child?  If we take a chance
<br>
and a child is born with a handicap, have we wronged the child?
<br>
<p>I certainly don't claim to have complete answers to these questions,
<br>
but here are some thoughts.  Let me focus on Lee's points, particularly
<br>
the last, would Dolly be better off dead?
<br>
<p>First, while I think there may be people and animals who are better
<br>
off dead, I think that would mostly apply only in extreme cases.
<br>
If someone is in terrible, constant, unrelievable pain, they might be
<br>
better off dead.  But just having arthritis or diabetes or some other
<br>
sickness that limits quality of life would not be enough to say that
<br>
someone is better off dead.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it's possible that Dolly had another alternative.
<br>
Her choices were not between being born defective and not being born
<br>
at all.  From a certain perspective, Dolly might have been born whole
<br>
and well.  She might have been born from a normal reproductive process,
<br>
with a different genome and different upbringing.  Her choices then are
<br>
between having defective genes and having healthy ones.  In that case
<br>
we would agree that having a healthy genome is the preferred outcome.
<br>
<p>The obvious difficulty with this perspective is that it raises the
<br>
question of who is Dolly?  How much of her life circumstances could
<br>
be changed while still allowing us to think of her as the same person?
<br>
Conventionally we draw a line and say that minor changes would preserve
<br>
identity - if I had had a different breakfast today, I would be the
<br>
same person.  But sufficiently large changes would commonly be said to
<br>
change this - I would have been a different person if I had been adopted,
<br>
or if I had a different set of siblings.
<br>
<p>However for some purposes we need to adopt a more inclusive position where
<br>
even large changes can be considered to preserve identity.  From this
<br>
point of view, the name is like a label or token which would apply to a
<br>
different entity in each possible world.  As long as we can come up with
<br>
a consistent naming scheme that applies the labels to entities across
<br>
the worlds, we can consider the entities carrying that name to be the
<br>
same identity.
<br>
<p>We saw some examples of this in our discussion of some of Robin Hanson's
<br>
&quot;agree to disagree&quot; economic results a few years ago.  Part of his
<br>
reasoning required considering the possibility that pairs of individuals
<br>
were born with circumstances and predispositions exchanged, in order to
<br>
analyze rationally when people should disagree.  This analysis predisposes
<br>
a notion of identity similar to what I have described above, where I can
<br>
consider what might have happened if I had been born as, say, George Bush,
<br>
with his genetics and upbringing.
<br>
<p>The point of this discursion is that if we accept that this is a
<br>
defensible notion of identity, then it is possible that Dolly might have
<br>
been born as someone other than a clone.  Maybe some other experiment
<br>
might have been done instead, and she would have been born healthy.
<br>
So we can disapprove of Dolly's creation without necessarily saying that
<br>
she would have been better off dead.  We could say that she would have
<br>
been better off healthy.
<br>
<p>The question remains though as to whether any sheep would have been born
<br>
to take Dolly's place if she had not been cloned.  And this arises even
<br>
more for human cloning, where at least in the early days the technology
<br>
seems likely to be applied mostly in cases where people are unable
<br>
to reproduce otherwise.  If the alternative to the cloning is to have
<br>
no one born, human or sheep, then we really are back to the situation
<br>
raised by Lee, where you have to claim that the clone is better off dead
<br>
in order to condemn their birth.
<br>
<p>Summing up, if cloning allows for more people to be born than would be
<br>
possible otherwise, it is hard to object unless the clones' lives are
<br>
so terrible that they all commit suicide as soon as possible to end
<br>
their agonizing existence.  But if there are alternatives to cloning
<br>
that still allow just as many people to be born (including adoption of
<br>
healthy babies birthed by others), then we could say that the cloning
<br>
is wrong if it creates people who are less healthy than would have
<br>
been born in the alternative.  At this point it looks to me like the
<br>
second circumstance holds, that cloning will not substantially increase
<br>
the number of human beings in the world, so this suggests that it is
<br>
proper to condemn cloning if it leads to unhealthy babies.
<br>
