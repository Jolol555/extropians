<p>
For the first time in weeks, I've been able to scan almost every message
<br>
from the List that's come in over the last day, and see that the
<br>
discussion of the possible war in Iraq is dominating the bandwidth and
<br>
that the expression of opinions is as unfriendly as any I've seen before
<br>
here -- matching the small list of topics that have previously caused
<br>
such furor.  I perceive a deep division that the most vocal advocates on
<br>
each side see as emblematic of ideological differences that span many
<br>
issues; not just the possibility of war in Iraq.  Given the furor, I
<br>
thought I'd throw out my own thoughts and feelings on the subject.
<br>
<p>First, I've asked myself the question of whether the subject of the Iraq
<br>
war has a sufficiently transhumanist or extropian component to warrant
<br>
such a huge portion of the bandwidth here.  In many ways, the subject is
<br>
skew to extropians interests, since the potential combatants on both
<br>
sides have so little sympathy for extropian ideas and ideals.  But,
<br>
ultimately I suppose there is sufficient relevance to the reason for
<br>
this List's existence to tolerate such a large volume of discussion: To
<br>
name just three, questions of war and peace on such a scale can effect
<br>
that march of progress toward a transhuman world, the evolution of
<br>
methods of warfare will be relevant to our interests, and the
<br>
geopolitical alignment of the large interest groups in the world over
<br>
the next few decades will certainly have an impact on our goals.
<br>
<p>Second, for the record, I'll say that I'm deeply ambivalent about the
<br>
prospect of war in Iraq.  I have no sympathy for Saddam Hussein or the
<br>
culture that allows such people to hold power.  I find that culture to
<br>
be so pathologically corrupt that there is little or no chance that the
<br>
Iraqi people will ever throw off the rule of Saddam on their own, and
<br>
that there is every likelihood that he will be replaced by someone just
<br>
as bad or worse when he finally dies.  On the other hand, as of today, I
<br>
think the Bush administration has done a poor job of justifying
<br>
immediate, large-scale war to unseat Saddam.  
<br>
<p>The shape of current events seems to me to be sculpted by the logic of
<br>
military logistics more than anything else: It takes about six months
<br>
for the current U.S. military machine to mobilize and reposition itself
<br>
to fight a war of the scale that is contemplated, and the entire pace of
<br>
the current crisis seems to be dictated by that fact. The U.S. military
<br>
will be in position to launch a campaign in Iraq in February, and it
<br>
will be politically difficult and very expensive to hold the forces in
<br>
readiness for much longer beyond that; therefore, the timing of the
<br>
deadline for Saddam's compliance has to be aligned with the fairly
<br>
narrow window of time in which an optimal force-readiness profile can be
<br>
maintained.  This has stripped U.S. diplomacy of the ability to be
<br>
flexible, and has forced U.S. policymakers into a narrow range of
<br>
possible positions and responses to the opinion of allies and the
<br>
diplomatic maneuvers of U.S. opponents.  The diplomatic dialogue takes
<br>
place over a time span of 12- and 24-hour news cycles; the military
<br>
situation evolves much more slowly and with much less flexibility.
<br>
<p>On this last point, I've been doing quite a bit of reading in the area
<br>
of military policy lately, and the subject of &quot;force transformation&quot; (as
<br>
it is known in the jargon) is paramount in the literature.  Military
<br>
policy wonks realize that the long time periods it takes to reposition
<br>
and reconfigure meaningful amounts of military force create an extreme
<br>
limit on the flexibility of diplomatic capabilities.  Basically, the
<br>
idea is that the Cold War, with its objectives fixed over a half
<br>
century,  allowed U.S. forces to evolve into heavy, lumbering,
<br>
overly-complex monstrosities whose clumsiness place an extreme limit on
<br>
policy options.  The First Gulf War was a wake-up call, but the
<br>
transformation it heralded takes a LONG time.  Unfortunately, the
<br>
current Iraq conflict is being played out when &quot;force transformation&quot;
<br>
has barely begun.  The pace and texture of a similar conflict will look
<br>
very different in ten years: A U.S. president will have more options and
<br>
will be able to be both strong and flexible, something that isn't really
<br>
possible now.  In fact, one can see the foreign policy contrast between
<br>
the Clinton and Bush II years as being characterized as two different
<br>
choices in a binary dilemma: strong OR flexible.  Clinton chose the
<br>
latter, Bush II seems to be choosing the former.
<br>
<p>Seen in this light, the extreme division of opinion on the List over the
<br>
Iraq conflict can be seen as a choice forced by the lack of flexibility
<br>
of U.S. military forces. Perhaps we can say that the &quot;doves&quot; counsel a
<br>
Clintonian approach: If you can't be flexible, then you must be patient
<br>
and wait to deal with problems such as a dangerous person like Saddam
<br>
until you have the flexibility to take a more morally nuanced approach.
<br>
The &quot;hawks&quot; seem to say, using the phrase I learned from one of my
<br>
engineer clients, &quot;do the best you can with what you got.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I've used up all the time I had for writing this morning,
<br>
so I'll have to leave the topic at this.
