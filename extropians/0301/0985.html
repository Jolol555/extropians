<br>
<p>Early Monday morning, seven people were arrested under the Terrorism Act
<br>
2000 and were taken to a central London police station. Of the seven men
<br>
arrested, six were described as North African and aged between 23 and
<br>
48, and one as east European and aged 22. Police continued to search the
<br>
premises late on Monday morning, and could be seen removing computer
<br>
equipment and bags of files.
<br>
<p>Scotland Yard said the &quot;intelligence-led&quot; raid was linked to the
<br>
discovery of the poison ricin in nearby Wood Green earlier this month.
<br>
<p>BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said: &quot;It's part of this whole
<br>
nationwide operation to try to wrap up this network of suspected
<br>
Algerian militants here in Britain.&quot;
<br>
--------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>I am only surprised that it has taken this long for the security
<br>
services to start rooting out all the terrorists hidden among us. The
<br>
trouble with being an &quot;open&quot; society, willing to help people from all
<br>
round the world, is that we get taken advantage of by people who wish to
<br>
destroy our society. I am also surprised that I have not read about
<br>
similar activity by the security forces in USA. Surely they must also be
<br>
searching for the many terrorists already hiding in the country?
<br>
<p>It is going to be a long job to disinfect our houses and I am sure that
<br>
we will have to live through some rather nasty events before it is over.
<br>
And a nice, well-mannered &quot;live-and-let-live&quot; attitude will not persuade
<br>
them to leave us alone. They are here to destroy as many of us as they
<br>
can, not to negotiate with us.
<br>
<p>Take care, BillK
