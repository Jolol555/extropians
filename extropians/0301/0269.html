&quot;Interestingly, the same site notes:&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, a testament to the objectivity of the site.  However, it is worth
<br>
noting that the figures for vietnam were excluding war dead at 1,813,000.
<br>
That is, civilians.  Note the comments on the United states says &quot;foreigners
<br>
killed during foreign wars&quot;  
<br>
<p>You note...
<br>
<p>&quot;Dictatorships often do it to their own people as well as to foreigners&quot;
<br>
<p>And communist dictatorships which are despotic (is that redundant?) have the
<br>
absolute worse record in this regard, and this is exactly what kind of
<br>
nation North Vietnam was.  
<br>
<p>No state on record is morally flawless, and there are many many things I
<br>
consider morally invalid in the United states, but there are far more
<br>
morally valid things than invalid things, and North Vietnam had apparently
<br>
absolutely NO positive moral aspects,  (Aside from Jeff's percieved moral
<br>
attributes of Ho Chi being 'popular' and the desire to allow the people of
<br>
the north to dictate by vote what would happen to the south that is...) but
<br>
this is the country whos victory Jeff praises.  As an extropian I find this
<br>
difficult to understand, given the general prevalence among extropians for
<br>
freedom of choice, individual rights and civil liberties.

Subject: RE: Noam Chomsky (was RE: join The American Peace Movement)
<br>
<p><p>Dickey, Michael F:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Democide by (North) Vietnam: Total 1945-1987 1,669,000
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP6.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP6.HTM</a>
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly, the same site notes:
<br>
<p>&lt; Putting together all the subtotals... in this century the United States
<br>
probably murdered about 583,000 people... conceivable even as many as
<br>
1,641,000 all told. Virtually all of these were foreigners killed during
<br>
foreign wars. &gt;
<br>
<p>States do this kind of thing. Dictatorships often do it to their own people
<br>
as well as to foreigners.
