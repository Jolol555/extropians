A great email. I can only add the impact of eink.com and the xerox digital
<br>
paper/ink project will be factored in. Freebooks will exist in a webpage to
<br>
digital paper download environment as a subculture. Full notions of freeware
<br>
await self-reproducing assemblers. As an aside, this ties in with notions of
<br>
limits to scientific knowledge for physics substructure/cosmology vs.
<br>
relatively unlimited social/cultural engines. It also ties in with the
<br>
notion that &quot;base units of immortal living&quot; for relatively &quot;normal,
<br>
traditional human-style&quot; living can be provided for free, i.e. your generic
<br>
3-d car template, toaster template, blah blah. There may be several hundred
<br>
of such &quot;units&quot; of practical existence, with several dozen being of survival
<br>
level.

We

</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to the &quot;why&quot;, that is fairly easy to answer.  Most content producers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (those who have electronic copies of the media) don't run around
</em><br>
publishing
<br>
<em>&gt; their materials in open forums because this amounts to (in the current
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; There appears to be a catalog of registered copyrights:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I mean i haven't bought a CD in like 5 years. Why shouldn't we be able
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; download books as well. I know it's illegal, but no one is doing
</em><br>
anything
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the free music.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think this is true, you haven't been reading Slashdot and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sources re: the various efforts regarding the RIAA and enforcement of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DMCA or some of the laws being floated before congress at this time.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't for lack of *trying* to solve the problem.  It is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to really solve it one has to trump both (a) encryption technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (b) distributed computing.  It doesn't seem likely that (a)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will happen without &quot;quantum computing&quot; or that (b) will happen without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some really strong revocation of the concept of &quot;privacy rights&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your ability to enjoy novel (new) music would disappear overnight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if all artists producing such content simply refused to release it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a form that could be copied or redistributed.  (One could imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an &quot;active&quot; music player that simply refused to &quot;play&quot; a song unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it could connect to a secure server and verify one owned a license
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to listen to said song.  I.e. you have to provide a real-time thumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; print at human body temperatures matched with a voice print and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retina scan in order to enable the playing of specific songs for the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 24 hours.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Really though shouldn't these books be available to anyone for free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For transhumanistic ideas to gain a greater base shouldn't it be free
</em><br>
like
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the bible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This depends on the author.  For example, I make many of the papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've written over the last decade available for free to anyone with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much excess time on their hands that they will bother to read them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many other academic types do the same (though they usually go through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some &quot;producers&quot; to do so).  There is obviously quite a dichotomy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between Nature charging one $15.00 to receive a copy of a paper,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I as an author could XoX and send to you for probably less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than $1.00.  Obviously the dichotomy gets much larger when one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considers that one can pay $15.00 for a 6-8 page paper from Nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or $15.95 for &quot;The Spike&quot; (384 pages) from Amazon [even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discounted if you get &quot;The Spike&quot; and &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for $21.64].  Is the information content of these books really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so low that academic papers can justify charging ~45x the amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per page?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is this -- until one has really robust nanotech -- so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal survival is not an issue (i.e. you can live off the &quot;fruit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the land&quot; for free), then one *has* to pay the scientists, reporters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authors, playrights, musicians, actors, etc. if one expects content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be produced.  It seems likely that that will flip once one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robust nanotech -- i.e. the producers will have to pay the consumers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consume their product because there will be a shift in the relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantity of producers/consumers.  But for now producer # is &lt;&lt; consumer #
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so the consumers should be paying in one way or another (taxes to direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payments) for the content they find useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What it comes down to is where is the money going that is generated by
</em><br>
these
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; books. If most of it is just going into someone's pocket tham I'm sorry
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seems very unextropian to me. I know people have to make a living but
</em><br>
beyond
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that there main concern should be to make as big an impact as they can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One has to keep in mind distribution numbers.  If a technical book,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g. Nanosystems or Nanomedicine, sells more than 10,000 copies it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewed as a blockbuster.  One has to contrast this with Michael Chrichton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel or a Tom Hanks movie where one is dealing with quantities of
</em><br>
millions.
<br>
<em>&gt; I think there may be a bias within the production industry as to how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one goes about creating a Michael or a Tom (so one can get the economies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of scale bumped by 2-3 orders of magnitude).  Whether that is generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good or bad I don't know.  It raises some paradoxical questions as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how one can have a &quot;big impact&quot; if one doesn't have a &quot;name&quot; and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can have a &quot;name&quot; if someone hasn't invested in creating that and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how one can &quot;invest in creating a name&quot; if one doesn't skim funds from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what one knows are really unprofitable ventures in order to invest those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds into &quot;name creation&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Food for thought.
