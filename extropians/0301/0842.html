<p>Charles,
<br>
<p>Excellent dissertation!  You and I are in 100% agreement as far as I can see.  I
<br>
grow weary of hearing the old tune that America's role in the Vietnam War was
<br>
purely for money.  To accept that premise is to play into the hands of the
<br>
leftist radicals, who would cast our war as an evil war and those of us who
<br>
served in it as &quot;dupes&quot; or worse.  It is true enough, many did make money from
<br>
the war.  Could it have been otherwise?  We are, after all, a Capitalist
<br>
society.  And it may well be true that the Johnson's and others in positions of
<br>
leadership owned stock in companies which may have profited from the
<br>
continuation of the war.  That does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that
<br>
profit was the sole reason LBJ was so anxious to commit ground combat troops
<br>
there, unless someone is blessed with psychic powers.  Effect is not always
<br>
indicative of cause, is it?
<br>
<p>I don't want to give too much credit to LBJ here, as I have very large bones to
<br>
pick with the way he and Mc Namara managed the war.  But I still believe our
<br>
role there was truly an attempt to stop the steamroller of World Communism.
<br>
Granted, the US role was badly mismanaged.  From a strategic standpoint, it was
<br>
almost totally inept!  But I still contend the motivation for our involvement
<br>
was NOT for profit.  Yes, profit was undeniably a primary effect of our
<br>
participation in the war for some US corporations, but such is the case in ANY
<br>
war, is it not?  I don't hear much criticism of US corporate profits that
<br>
resulted from World War II or the Korean War.
<br>
<p>[&quot;Obviously, without the massive support of the
<br>
communist bloc, there could have been no Vietnam War.&quot;]
<br>
<p>As for the Soviet and Chinese involvement in supporting the North Vietnamese,
<br>
what you have stated is absolutely true.  I am in a position to know this first
<br>
hand, especially with regard to the Chinese involvement.  Their support of the
<br>
North Vietnamese in the form of arms and troops was nothing less than massive.
<br>
As a Mandarin interpreter, I listened in on and translated air to ground /
<br>
ground to air radio transmissions between the Chinese IL-18 &quot;Beagle&quot; transports
<br>
and their air nav ground stations.  The transport flights originating in Bei
<br>
Jing, Shanghai, and other major Chinese cities, and terminating in Hanoi took
<br>
place EVERY DAY of my duty assignments in the Far East, which ran between
<br>
October of '66 and October '68.  (Onna Point, Okinawa and Ramasun Station,
<br>
Thailand)  I can assure you, those transport cargo bays were NOT empty when they
<br>
landed in Hanoi!  I have no reason to believe that Chinese support of North
<br>
Vietnam ceased when I returned Stateside.  The continued support of the North by
<br>
the Chinese and Soviets, after the US pulled its support out of the South is
<br>
absolutely what led to the fall of the Republic of Vietnam.  Domino fashion,
<br>
Cambodia and Laos followed shortly thereafter.  (Yes, the &quot;Domino Theory&quot; was
<br>
proven correct, though there still are some who will argue otherwise.)
<br>
<p>No offense to those who believe otherwise.  Just another of my &quot;two cents&quot;...
<br>
<p>In brotherhood,
<br>
