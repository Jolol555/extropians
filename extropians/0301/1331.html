<p>
&lt;&lt;Well, did the allied forces find bin Ladin? Did they destroy the Al-Qaida 
<br>
network? Not at all. Conventional military is good when you can input the 
<br>
coordinates of your enemy into GPS directed bombs, but they are worthless 
<br>
against an internation network of small groups in several countries&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Al Qeida surely wasn't destroyed. This was chiefly because the powers that be 
<br>
decided they could develop a workable relationship with the Pakistan 
<br>
governement. There may be many was to solve a problem as there are ways to 
<br>
write a computer program, but it breaks down to elegent programming and 
<br>
inelelegent programing. Similarly, the war against islamic terror, can be 
<br>
conducted in a number of ways.
<br>
<p>Terrorist attacks against Osama sympathizers would have shocked the jihadis 
<br>
into re-thinking their options. This would have been my way, at least. But, 
<br>
as I indicated before, this is the only game in town, so I will play by 
<br>
Bushes rules for now.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Today, Afghanistan is a devasteted country, were only a small area around 
<br>
Kabul is a relatively safe place. It only is because of the UN troops 
<br>
there who help the new regime to establish and maintain a lawful system. 
<br>
The farer away you get from Kabul, the less important all this becomes. 
<br>
There are still clans fighting about control, power and influence in 
<br>
their region. And many former Taliban are hidden among them.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Should I break out the hankerchiefs? The Taleban regime was deposed, and as 
<br>
far as the UN goes, those bastards have caused more wars then they have 
<br>
resolved. They and their stupid blue helmets can go to hell. Afghanistan is 
<br>
freer now and the murderous regime, which you seem to gloss over is kaput.  
<br>
Also, do you want us to discipline the clans so they behave themselves? We 
<br>
can do that, but you would complain about American oppression of traditional 
<br>
tribal culture, would you not? As for as hidden bad guys, in Japan, Italy, 
<br>
and Germany, we had a few of those folks also, after WW2, securing office. 
<br>
Kurt Waldheim as Chancellor of Austria, and yes UN chieftan, comes to mind.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The main problems in Afghanistan have not been solved, yet. It will take 
<br>
decades to develop a civil and  democratic society in Afghanistan. This 
<br>
process will require a lot of personnel, money, tedious talks and 
<br>
development aid. But if we don't spend this aid, Afghanistan will fall 
<br>
back into its old system and be a wonderful shelter for every fanatic 
<br>
muslim group.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I have no problem helping a 15th century society make its own way, but you 
<br>
have to kick out the the Taleban and co-mingled Al Qeida thugs before any 
<br>
progress can take place. The USA invaded for its own self-serving reasons, 
<br>
and Afghanistan benefited anyway. There was considerable Afghani resentment 
<br>
against the Taleban for bringing Islamic Arab enforcers into Afghanistan to 
<br>
perform the dirty work, of executions and enforcement of Sharia.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The question is, if we will survive the counterstrike of the other 
<br>
chicken :-) How many young, politically mislead people from arabia will 
<br>
this &quot;omlette&quot; push into the fangs of Al-Qaida and other terrorist 
<br>
groups? How much more funds will these groups raise in islamic countries?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This hypothesis has been bounced around, and what actually results 
<br>
experientially is the Islamic street, the Souk, respects power and its steady 
<br>
use.  The vast majority of Muslims will (apparently) ride the winning horse, 
<br>
so to speak. Under Clinton, the perception, correct or not, was that of 
<br>
American decline and weakness. This is not what I believe of the recent 
<br>
American past, but it seems to actually be what many Muslims believed.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The bad news is, that the islamic militants have won the war of the minds
<br>
in their countries by providing schools, social aid and a meaning for 
<br>
their life. This gives them almost unlimited support. We, the western 
<br>
world, have to convince the majority of the people there, that it is far 
<br>
better not to follow those ideas of a closed belief system, but to go 
<br>
with us. We have to convince them, that we are not going to plunder their 
<br>
resources, destroy their culture, fight their religion, raise McDonalds 
<br>
temples on their holy ground. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think you try too hard to please people who may just dislike you no matter 
<br>
what you attempt.  The success of the Islamist today are a reflection of the 
<br>
failure of Arab nationalism, Baathist Socialism, and so forth. They are 
<br>
pissed off at the west because they are envious, and they seem to feel that 
<br>
if they have all the answers, due to being the 'true faith,' then why does 
<br>
the West prosper? 
<br>
<p>Finally, I believe its fair to announce that &quot;fighting their religion&quot; is 
<br>
almost axiomatic. The general philosphy is a kind of  religious-political 
<br>
imperialism, all its own. Just because you are tolerant of other kinds of 
<br>
people, does not mean that your forthright behavior will be returned. Respect 
<br>
is a two way street, and not merely a moral obligation of western lands.
