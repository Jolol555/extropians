<br>
<p>&quot;Come on, Lee.  Lighten up.  This poll is rather funny.  And given that
<br>
there have been more than 300,000 responses, it does point to a real
<br>
public sentiment out there.&quot;
<br>
<p>Funny?  I find the results of this poll disturbing and sickening.  I would
<br>
wager that a question such as 'what is the most evil country in the world'
<br>
would garner similar results in Europe and in even in the United States
<br>
would probably get a 30 - 40% answer in the positive.
<br>
<p>Countries ruled by despotic dictators, theocracies, and monarchies oppose
<br>
nearly *everything* in the ideals of extropians.  I find nothing about
<br>
perpetuating their existence, or claiming their anti-thetical entities as
<br>
'threats to world peace' funny in any way shape or form.  Consider a short
<br>
description of the Iraqi attack on kurds at the city of Haljabi 
<br>
<p>&quot;The scene that greeted them in the morning defied description. The streets
<br>
were strewn with corpses. People had been killed instantaneously by
<br>
chemicals in the midst of the ordinary acts of everyday life. Babies still
<br>
sucked their mothers' breasts. Children held their parents' hands, frozen to
<br>
the spot like a still from a motion picture. In the space of a few hours
<br>
5,000 people had died. The 3,200 who no longer had families were buried in a
<br>
mass grave.&quot;
<br>
<p>The public also opposed the war in vietnam thanks to peace protestors, at
<br>
the cost of 3 million indochinese peoples lives and forced many millions
<br>
more into communist peasant slavery, and opposed American intervention in
<br>
WWII, which cost countless many millions of lives.  The most fervent
<br>
supporters of the 'anti war' movement in the united states are defenders of
<br>
Slobadon Milosivich, Saddam himself, the Chinese Government in the Tienam
<br>
Square massacre, and virtually every other leftist murderous tyrant.  
<br>
<p>That people support individuals and organizations like these is *not* funny.
