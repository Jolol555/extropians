-----Original Message-----

From: Samantha Atkins [mailto:<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=RE:%20rooting%20for%20the%20Americans">samantha@objectent.com</a>] 
<br>
<p>&quot;I think we are more noble as Americans when we take our heritage seriously
<br>
enough to avoid entanglements all over the globe 
<br>
engaged in for highly questionable reasons and at very high costs at all
<br>
levels.  We have no business as a free people going 
<br>
to war except in very clear circumstances.  Iraq is NOT such at this time.&quot;
<br>
<p>Samantha, thanks for your comments.  I can only ask what would you consider
<br>
those 'very clear' circumstances to be?  As free people, do we not value
<br>
freedom, and in doing so, wish freedom upon others?  As extropians, I should
<br>
hope that we prefer all humans, regardless of ethnicity, geography, or
<br>
ideology live under a system which grants them basic constitutional rights.
<br>
By being 'anti-war' with regard to IRAQ, you are necessarily 'pro corrupt
<br>
murderous despotic dictator'  What of the IRAQ government, and Suddam's
<br>
manner of oppression, do you find morally defensible?  Since a state is only
<br>
a collection of individuals, the only moral states are ones that exist as
<br>
extensions of individuals, IRAQ is no such state, it is built on murder,
<br>
oppression, corruption, and deceit.  Given this, I do not understand your
<br>
claim that we have 'no business' going there as 'free people'? Should we get
<br>
in the habit of just not caring about people unless they are Americans?    
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Emancipation was not delivered by cousin Abe with his Emancipation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Proclamation but by my great great uncle (and thousands of others) lying
</em><br>
dead 
<br>
<em>&gt; in the military graveyard in Nashville, Tennessee (and other places).
</em><br>
<p>&quot;So all you understand and consider honorable is war, might, death and
<br>
destruction?  If so, then I pity you.&quot;
<br>
<p>War committed in an effort to free people and dispose of murderous dictators
<br>
is both 'honorable' and more importantly morally justified.  Do you consider
<br>
'war' to never be honorable under ANY circumstances?  
<br>
<p>&quot;What is this &quot;we&quot;?  You will sit this one out due to age and cheer other
<br>
&quot;boys&quot; on to their death in a more senseless 
<br>
conflict than even Vietnam was.  Bully for you.&quot;
<br>
<p>Given the events that transpired in Indochina after the peace and anti war
<br>
advocates 'won' and forced the US to abandon Indochina to the corrupt
<br>
despotic murderous regimes of Mao, Pol Pot, Ho Chi Min and the Soviet Union,
<br>
and the resultant millions who were murdered or killed, I do not understand
<br>
how one can consider the Vietnam war 'senseless'.  
<br>
<p>Perhaps what was 'senseless' about it was that, in addition to many poor
<br>
military decisions and political decisions, was that we gave up and
<br>
abandoned those people to collectivization and labor camps.  I hope that the
<br>
same thing does not happen here, and that we do not abandon the IRAQI people
<br>
to the hands of a murderous meglomoniacal dictator.
<br>
