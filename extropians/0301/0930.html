<p>I don't know about that, but I do know that there have been, for a long
<br>
time, t-shirts that say &quot;I am not an American&quot;, in several languages.
<br>
Australian and Canadian tourists are big fans of them, afaik. Now I bet
<br>
*they* are selling like hotcakes right now.
<br>
<p>I think I'd like a t-shirt that says &quot;Also human&quot;.
