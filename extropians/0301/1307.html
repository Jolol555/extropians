<p>I have yet to visit Germany.  I did live and work in the Naples, Italy area
<br>
for three years assigned to Allied Forces South.  Today I met a 64 y.o.
<br>
American gentleman who has a German son-in-law in Bavaria.  The German s-i-l
<br>
is quite favorable towards America and Americans; however his brother has a
<br>
poor opinion of America.  This is true diversity.  The latter fellow is
<br>
self-made business owner (music stores) and wealthy.  He thinks Americans
<br>
are low-brows.
<br>
<p>We discussed this issue at length today.  The 64 y.o. is from Florida, the
<br>
second fellow is from Oklahoma and I am from Indiana.  Each had served three
<br>
tours in Germany and they were enthusiastic about meeting German people,
<br>
visiting museums, taking a trip to Switzerland with a Germany family, etc.
<br>
<p>My family has German ancestry.  My mother was born in Haubstadt, that is,
<br>
Haubstadt, Indiana [;&gt;))].  In elementary school I sang songs in German and
<br>
English - O Tannenbaum.
<br>
<p>I agree that cultural habits are humorous.  My wife of 30 years is
<br>
Thai-Chinese and I always insist this is an intercultural marriage and not
<br>
that tired American cliche - interracial marriage.
<br>
<p>German fascination with the American West and Native Americans is well known.
<br>
There are several dozen Germans living either seasonally or full-time in the
<br>
nearby tourist trap - Tombstone.  I discovered this while recruiting and
<br>
crewing for Census 2000.
<br>
<p>Just some observations that are hopefully without political bent.
<br>
