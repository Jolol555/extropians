<br>
<p>Good question, Michael.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old Granddaddy told me that if I was in North America and heard
<br>
the 
<br>
thunder of pounding hooves I was to expect to see horses not zebra.  Jeff 
<br>
gives me a long reading assignment after which I will be enlightened inre
<br>
the 
<br>
origins of the Vietnamese War -- I will have proof that the refugees did not
<br>
<p>flee the North because of suppression.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------
<br>
<p>Ron, thanks for your comments.  I see that this issue is a complex one with
<br>
idealogies on both sides fighting it out, and any source that gets sighted
<br>
Jeff just claims is 'anti-communist rhetoric' or whatever.  Similiarly we
<br>
could say the converse of everything he cites.  Obviously there is a truth
<br>
to be found, which he insists he already has and really find it difficult to
<br>
even be bothered by our objections.  But even when mulling through the
<br>
various 'historical' accounts it becomes obvious that North Vietnam was NOT
<br>
a constitutional democratic republic.  This is why I have asked Jeff what he
<br>
considers to be a just state.  A country that violates the rights of its own
<br>
citizens, will not respect the rights of its neighbors. Those who do not
<br>
recognize individuals rights, will not recognize the rights of nations: a
<br>
nation is only a number of individuals.  Jeff seems focused on who signed
<br>
what document and what it said, and whether that DOCUMENT essentially
<br>
*grants* the south a right to existence.  I say, who cares what the document
<br>
said.  In any circumstances when a group wishes to form a free democratic
<br>
constitutional republic nation free from a non-democratic nation than it is
<br>
just.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But then I ask myself did those Vietnamese refugees I worked with
<br>
have 
<br>
their stories straight?  Did they leave Vietnam and brave the dangers they 
<br>
braved just because they found that workers paradise boring?  Were they
<br>
tired 
<br>
of living among family &amp; friends until they had to leave loved ones behind 
<br>
and go live with strangers?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------
<br>
<p>I would love to hear some of these peoples stories, as distressing and
<br>
disturbing as I am sure they would be.  I don't think stories likese these
<br>
can ever be told often enough.  We should not let the attrocities that these
<br>
people went through pass by.  Have you ever thought of trying to collect
<br>
some of their stories?
<br>
<p>Ron, what do you say you and I have a little vote, Jeff is of course free to
<br>
participate.  First, lets you and I sign an agreement that says we agree to
<br>
Jeff abiding by our vote, should our vote occur.  Now, who votes that Jeff
<br>
give you And I all his money and assets?  *raises hand*  Since we are
<br>
allowing Jeff to vote, it is freedom (by his contention), he merely has to
<br>
deal with the conseuquencies of his vote!
<br>
