<em>&gt; So far as it goes the &quot;reins&quot; of &quot;power&quot; are held by the elites in

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; elite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holds about 2.3% of &quot;power&quot; and the remaining 2.7% is divided between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And unfortunately it is not &quot;ultimate&quot; power, it is power per se.
</em><br>
<p>Thus perpetuating the myth that owning nuclear weapons gives one power.
<br>
It is a noose, not a gun, which one builds for oneself. Militarily,
<br>
nukes are entirely useless as weapons. They are instruments of
<br>
politics, of no military utility.
<br>
<p>As such, they are good for little more than sublimated collective
<br>
scrotal stroking (and causing testicular retractions in your enemies).
<br>
<p>They are quite useful for Orion class spaceships, though.
<br>
<p>The 'elites' in the US and europe do not hold power over their
<br>
electorates via threat of nuking uppity citizens, so your point is
<br>
quite wrong. Globally, our ownership of nukes is only useful in holding
<br>
at bay other nuke owners from insane courses of action.
<br>
<p>This is assuming that a nuke owner is capable of sane courses of
<br>
action, which in the case of Iraq and North Korea, is very much in
<br>
doubt.
<br>
<p>I'd like also to note that there are now 8 european nations which have
<br>
pledged support for the US strategy, leaving poor little France and
<br>
Germany increasingly isolated, with only those nations that practice
<br>
neutrality to play with. Spain, Portugal, Italy, Poland, Czech
<br>
Republic, Albania, Slovakia, and Britain. Now, Spain's military is
<br>
nothing to sneeze at. The F-18s they've been buying from us for years
<br>
puts their air force years ahead of the antiquated and beastly Tornados
<br>
that France and Germany are saddled with. Britain has been improving
<br>
the last decade, and Italy is no slouch either. Bulgaria and Hungary
<br>
also express support for the US.
