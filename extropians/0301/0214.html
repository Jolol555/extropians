From: Brett Paatsch 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Whilst I understand Natasha concern, I am not sure that I can agree
</em><br>
with Hubert's &quot;assessment&quot; this time. It may well be that certain memes
<br>
can serve as bad examples and opportunities to differentiate ourselves
<br>
in the eyes of newbies (and some not so newbies) I think this group
<br>
*is* vital and energetic enough, and also that if it is to grow still more
<br>
effective in propagating its memes then it will need to do so under
<br>
environmental conditions that will not always be sweet sunshine and
<br>
soft gentle rain.&lt;
<br>
___________
<br>
<p>I think you may have taken this post too seriously, Brett.
<br>
<p>While I prefer to lay cards on the table, I also foster any bit of wisdom
<br>
from life experience to steer clear of situations that suck energy. There
<br>
are far better ways of driving the meme engine than to focus on negative
<br>
commentary.  Any smart book on business and psychological strategy will
<br>
concer that 10% focus on the problem and 90% focus on the solution has a
<br>
better chance of bringing about success.
<br>
<p>In this case, a successful outcome for categorizing transhumanists
<br>
inappropriately would be to work harder positive memes that provoke
<br>
intelligent and compassionate acts.  Hello Pro-Act.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Frankly, it has hardly been tested yet in comparison with what may
</em><br>
be thrown at it by those seeing extropic memes as a threat and really
<br>
going after it.&lt;
<br>
____________
<br>
<p>Extropic memes are not a threat to anyone who is able to accept change. 
<br>
Even the most conservative of people are aware that life is full of change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly there was no threat to ExI from Lyle Burkhead
</em><br>
in the link I saw. He didn't even associate himself with extropians.&lt;
<br>
___________
<br>
<p>Exactly.  He associated himself with trashumanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Still, it is certainly not my list, and others have invested much in
</em><br>
setting it up and maintaining it. I consider myself to be an extropian
<br>
(as I understand it) and I will help defend the fort if it needs
<br>
defending so long as what is inside remains worth defending. I
<br>
certainly see no immediate danger of that not being the case.&lt;
<br>
__________
<br>
<p>Why do you consider the comment of one person, me, as a given for the list?
<br>
Just because I prefer not to discuss one person's ideas becasue I'd rather
<br>
focus on other things should not warrant any concern on your part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If any of the extropian committee (especially) ever sends me a
</em><br>
please desist or consider post offlist I *will* heed it. But I strongly
<br>
urge against shooting messengers, it is a very easy mistake to
<br>
make even for bright capable folk.&lt;
<br>
<p>I have no idea what you are talking about.  
<br>
<p>Kind regards,
<br>
<p>Natasha
