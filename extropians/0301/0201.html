rate of defective children is halt current cloning effects until

sufficiently debugged on animal model for first human trials.

<p>Once they are born, yes. The point is not that, however. The point is that
<br>
our current actions will result in a highly probable outcome: normal or
<br>
defective. Given our current knowledge, there is a clear choice between
<br>
these two alternatives.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I would tend to agree with your second point to overcome defects that

</em><br>
<p>Of course. Normal birth results in abnormalities. So let's use actual 
<br>
numbers, computing probabilities. All decisions should be based on actual 
<br>
data, not beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; possible detail that may cause a clone to have defects. These details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not only include our mastery of the Human Genome. Other factors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the health of the mother, Physical, Chemical or biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trauma to the unborn clone and countless other things could result in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a clone with defects. Nature has been splicing our genes for millions
</em><br>
<p>Yes. With a given, known probability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of years and even when offspring are genetically fine, there can still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be other problems. That is why it is inevitable that some clones will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be born with defects. Substitute 'defect' for illness/pathology, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if that helps.
</em><br>
<p>Little disagreement there. Let's look at the numbers. Given healthy
<br>
parents, we have to compare with normal birth. Given sterile parents, we
<br>
have to look at IVF defect rate (loosely defined, including spontaneous
<br>
aborts) for comparison. If we were to discuss something resulting in
<br>
actual policy we would have to gather enough data to compute probabilities 
<br>
with sufficiently small error ranges.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think the dataset on the side of the clones is a little too small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a valid argument. I would say without hesitation that if had the
</em><br>
<p>Not quite, if you factor in the low success rate. Otherwise I agree: wen 
<br>
need statistically significant chimp data before we touch people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; choice of being born through natural methods or cloning at present.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd opt for the natural method. The current defect rate in cloning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would seem to be incredibly high. This still doesn't remove the
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; natural problems of reproduction from the argument. It just helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highlight my previous point that defects can and will occur even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actual cloning procedure is perfect. My statement says that the
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Depending on motivation for cloning (because clearly there has to be 
<br>
a point for it if we're looking at vanilla couples) the risks have to 
<br>
outweigh the benefits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; world is not black or white and that the possible outcomes of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduction and cloning are very grey. Neither is perfect and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome of cloning is still reliant on the natural process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gestation.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't quite follow you. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying that me being either the cloning doctor or parent. If you were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the clone and you were born with a defect that caused your life to be of such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a low standard that you felt it wasn't worth living. Then you would sue me or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse? 
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        If so then I will try to clarify what I said. I personally believe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that where we draw the line demarking what is and isn't worth living depends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely on your personal beliefs. If I had an accident that paralysed me and 
</em><br>
<p>Right. On personal beliefs of those affected, which you cannot question in 
<br>
advance because that person is not yet there. So clearly you can't ask for 
<br>
consent, if confronted with making a choice between multiple alternatives, 
<br>
associated with computable risks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; left me on a ventilator, entirely dependent on others for survival. My life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still be worth living. Likewise if I were born  with a similar 
</em><br>
<p>I don't know. I can't tell it in advance. You'll notice that a number of 
<br>
people terminate their lives for no externally visible reasons. So clearly 
<br>
there is a choice to make, and no one can make the choice but the person 
<br>
affected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; condition my life in my view would still be worth living. Arguments of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Identity aside, there would still be a conscious chain of though that would 
</em><br>
<p>There are no relevant identity arguments I'm aware of. The matters are 
<br>
really simple. The time of the decision is past already. You can only 
<br>
apply feedback to the parties who made the decision according to your 
<br>
subjective evaluation of said decision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; exist. There would also be a Hope of improvement. If I had never existed, 
</em><br>
<p>Once you're there, the point is moot. But we're talking about the event 
<br>
resulting in you, and the decisions associated with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there would never be a conciseness or any hope of improvement. So as you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see, I set the line pretty damn low, I imagine that you may not. 
</em><br>
<p>Not really. You just lump two separate issues together, wheras I treat 
<br>
them separately. This results in a different evaluation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        In any case, a clone would have no more right to Sue than any person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living today that has been born with deformities or ailments. If it was shown 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the clone would have more rights to sue because there is no damn 
<br>
reason why people should clone people. Unless explained, cloning looks 
<br>
like a frivolous decision with the clone being the one winding up with the 
<br>
bill for it. Doesn't look quite right, does it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that these were caused by or were knowingly not prevented by the doctors. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then of course a clone would have a right to sue, just as anyone has the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right today.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and in fact more so.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Please elaborate. Strawman is not something I am familiar with. If its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a gibe at my response to the comedic scaremongouring that some idiots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have raised against cloning. Then Yes I know I shouldn't lower the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of the thread to include such inane arguments.
</em><br>
<p>It's a description of a type of argument where you ascribe to your 
<br>
opponent obviously ludicrous beliefs she does not hold, and then tear them 
<br>
down with a flourish, then claiming victory.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Why would there be artificially produced defects? If you mean, defects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resultant from the process then that is one thing. Defects that are produced 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; artificially would point to something different and more sinister. 
</em><br>
<p>No. You can decide to clone or not to clone. The decision to clone 
<br>
resulting in defects whereas decision to not to clone resulting in no 
<br>
defects clearly shows that cloning defects are artificial. They need not 
<br>
be there. We put them there deliberately. Because we made a bad judgement, 
<br>
or because we're actively evil.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        My suggestion to replace clone with Twin was purely as a response to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ridiculous arguments or fears such as Armies of clones. It was mearly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant to remove the unknown irrational fear element that the word Clone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connotes and replace it with something of virtually equal meaning that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laypeople are familiar with. 
</em><br>
<p>The substitution would have been valid, except cloning is a deliberate
<br>
process resulting in defects, whereas natural twins are the low-defect
<br>
result of a natural process largely outside of our control, currently.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Doing what on purpose? When I say Twin I am of course referring to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically identical twin resultant of a division of the ovum into two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically identical people. This Twin is greatly different in creation to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cloning of a living person. however the result is the same. Two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically identical people. The clone is for argument sake, just a twin of 
</em><br>
<p>No. They are not genetically identical. You can tell them apart due to 
<br>
their gene activity pattern. You can very easily tell them apart, because 
<br>
one has visible defects, and the original is healthy. It's a bad xerox of 
<br>
a twin, not a real twin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a living person that was created and born at a later time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I wouldn't go as far as to say that a clone of a twin is a triplet, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I may say that it is a twin of a twin. Could this not be considered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct? The point being that a Clone and a twin only differ in the method of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation. The result is the same. 
</em><br>
<p>No. The result is NOT the same. See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        The only exception to this I can see is where mitochondria are brought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the equation. It could be that a Clone could have different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mitochondrial DNA to the person that was the original. Even in this case, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essence of what makes the clone identical to the original e. g the genes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be identical as in a twin.
</em><br>
<p>Do not look at mitochondria. Look at the sick clone and the healthy 
<br>
counterpart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Again, why would the clone be defective? What have civil rights of 
</em><br>
<p>The clone will be defective because the current process sucks. As you 
<br>
know, different medical procedures result in vastly different outcomes. It 
<br>
is very important to get it right. If you do it wrong, the results can be 
<br>
disastrous, and typically are. Apparently tiny things gone wrong in a 
<br>
procedure result in life and death, or worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; clones and twins and irrational fears of cloning got to do with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of a clone having defects? The point was that a clone should and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have every civil right that a person of natural reproductive creation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have. As is the case with IVF. 
</em><br>
<p>Of course. But we were not discussing that.
