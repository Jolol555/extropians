<em>&gt; Yeah, I had wondered about that in his posts. So the USA should be good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liitle victims and ignore 9-11?
</em><br>
<p>No, but your president and his fellows should think a little bit further. 
<br>
It's not enough to throw some bombs, when this just feeds the troops of 
<br>
another enemy.
<br>
<p>War against terrorism is not comparable with conventional wars. It means 
<br>
fighting against belief systems and against the causes for the motivation 
<br>
of those people. Wars like this can not be won with bombs. You either win 
<br>
them in the minds or not at all. Therefore, the only intelligent idea of 
<br>
Mr. Bush so far has been the &quot;coalition against terrorism&quot;. He now is 
<br>
going to destroy this coalition for no sensible reason.
<br>
<p>The Iraq topic has nothing to do with &quot;terrorism&quot;. Not even the Bush 
<br>
regime has yet found a connection between radical islam and Hussein. Iraq 
<br>
is almost 10,000km away from New York and Washington. Hussein has nothing 
<br>
to win in a war against the US. So, what's the dangerous thing with Iraq? 
<br>
Weapons of mass destruction? There are a lot more countries known to have 
<br>
or manufacture ABC weapons, which are a lot more unstable, unpredictable 
<br>
and would sell anything to anyone. Former GUS states, Pakistan, North 
<br>
Korea, Jemen, Sudan, etc. So why isn't there an international coalition 
<br>
against proliferation, lead by the US, but instead only one focus on one 
<br>
of the most unlikely terrorist supporting countries in the world?
<br>
<p>If you want to hear my guess: There's no profit to win by attacking those 
<br>
others. Iraq has the second largest oil resources currently known. A 
<br>
puppet regime in Bagdad would guarantee a good profit to all those 
<br>
multi-billion dollar companies who heaved Mr Bush into his office with 
<br>
the largest campaign contributions ever seen. The same goes for 
<br>
Afganistan. It was the only country opposing the long wanted pipeline[1], 
<br>
rsp. wanting too much money.
<br>
<p>The US are not going to war for moral, ethics and democracy - or not any 
<br>
longer. Would that be so, other countries than Iraq would be top on the 
<br>
list. Countries where people die of hunger, while a small elite sells 
<br>
their country for their own profit.
<br>
<p>This war against Iraq is about profit and domination of the resources for 
<br>
the next two decades. It is a war of a puppet regime of the oil 
<br>
companies, that uses US media to mobilize emotions like nationalism and 
<br>
uses US troops for their own business. And sorry, it would be total 
<br>
foolishness to risk a years long uproar of the whole middle east and many 
<br>
more terrorist attacks, for reasons like that.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why does the USA still have troops in rich Europe?
</em><br>
<p>(1) They need the supply and infrastructure, because ...
<br>
(2) ... they can't reach targets in the middle east from the US directly
<br>
(3) The bases exist; it would be costly to rebuild them somewhere else
<br>
(4) The political landscape here is rather stable and reliable
<br>
(5) To fulfill their duties according to the NATO treaties
<br>
(6) To maintain their NSA and CIA posts, the Echelon network, etc.
<br>
(7) To keep a foot in the door for everything that happens here
