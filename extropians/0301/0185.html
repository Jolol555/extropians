<em>&gt; &gt; [Where] the discussion of the Lyle Burkhead['s] memes are concerned:

<em>&gt; They are not worth the interaction of photons with recycled electrons the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natasha
</em><br>
<p>Whilst I understand Natasha concern, I am not sure that I can agree
<br>
with Hubert's &quot;assessment&quot; this time. It may well be that certain memes
<br>
can serve as bad examples and opportunities to differentiate ourselves
<br>
in the eyes of newbies (and some not so newbies) I think this group
<br>
*is* vital and energetic enough, and also that if it is to grow still more
<br>
effective in propagating its memes then it will need to do so under
<br>
environmental conditions that will not always be sweet sunshine and
<br>
soft gentle rain.
<br>
<p>Frankly, it has hardly been tested yet in comparison with what may
<br>
be thrown at it by those seeing extropic memes as a threat and really
<br>
going after it. Certainly there was no threat to ExI from Lyle Burkhead
<br>
in the link I saw. He didn't even associate himself with extropians. He
<br>
actually says in the link (which is all of his work I've read or am
<br>
particularly interested in reading). &quot;The fact that I disagree with other
<br>
transhumanists doesn't mean I should abandon the field, it just means
<br>
I should state my positions clearly and delineate the exact difference
<br>
between my view and those of the Extropians and other groups&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt;From his own words its seems clear to me he doesn't consider
</em><br>
himself an extropian he considers himself a transhumanist.
<br>
<p>So long as many people fear the unknown and certain dark memes
<br>
remain in the &quot;collective consciousness&quot; (a bit of an oxymoron - I
<br>
admit) words like transhuman will continue to invoke both casual
<br>
curiousity and some anxiety and the opportunity for some cheap
<br>
shots and muckraking. Its just not *healthy* to forget that any
<br>
group concerned with changing so much of the status quo of
<br>
contemporary society even for the better (and with the best of
<br>
motives) can still be misunderstood both those outside it and can so
<br>
easily be misrepresented by those opposed to it to the wider
<br>
community. Toth-Fejel, if he was a Catholic, (and Greg Burch says
<br>
he was and that *is* good enough for me) was *gentle* and almost
<br>
encouraging compared to some that may target extropians and
<br>
transhumanists.  One can have relative safety or relative political
<br>
effectiveness in achieving ones memes. I don't see that one can
<br>
have both when the memes are so different and challenging to so
<br>
many in the mainstream.
<br>
<p>Still, it is certainly not my list, and others have invested much in
<br>
setting it up and maintaining it. I consider myself to be an extropian
<br>
(as I understand it) and I will help defend the fort if it needs
<br>
defending so long as what is inside remains worth defending. I
<br>
certainly see no immediate danger of that not being the case.
<br>
<p>If any of the extropian committee (especially) ever sends me a
<br>
please desist or consider post offlist I *will* heed it. But I strongly
<br>
urge against shooting messengers, it is a very easy mistake to
<br>
make even for bright capable folk.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
