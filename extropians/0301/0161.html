<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CARLSON: Dr. More .......Now, you're a believer in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cryonics. What -- if you're a believer, do you keep a -- I
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it dies?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DR. MAX MORE, PRESIDENT, EXTROPY INSTITUTE:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, first of all, I'm not a believer. I don't like to be a believer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in anything.
<br>
----------
<br>
<p>The word belief, like the word faith, is at best laden with ambiguity.
<br>
I assume that when transhumanists use 'belief' and 'faith' they are
<br>
using these terms more as a convenient shorthand to differentiate
<br>
qualitatively between that which they reckon they *know*
<br>
(eg. 1 + 1 = 2), and that which they reckon they don't *know* for
<br>
sure. If I use the word belief (I don't like it so I try not to) I would
<br>
mean it in the sense that I suspect or intuit that something is probably
<br>
true (usually without putting an actual probability value on it), but I'd
<br>
recognize I could be wrong. &quot;Belief &quot; then becomes for me 
<br>
shorthand for &quot;this is a useful operating principle which I/we are
<br>
assuming in the absence of certainty.&quot;
<br>
<p>That said, I strongly suspect that that is not how the vast majority
<br>
of the population interpret the word belief (to the extent that they
<br>
think about it at all).
<br>
<p>Alas, the vast majority of the population, imo, still live in what
<br>
Carl Sagan called a &quot;Demon Haunted World&quot; (in a book by the
<br>
same title). They have not yet separated themselves from 
<br>
superstition and when they stick their uncritical, unweighted,
<br>
propositions in each others faces they do so proclaiming all too
<br>
often, all too proudly, as though it were a great virtue in itself,
<br>
&quot;this is what I  BELIEVE !&quot;. I'm not superstitious and I don't
<br>
want the words I use to help other people to characterise me
<br>
as superstitious.  
<br>
<p>When I was younger I just found it exasperating that many
<br>
apparently intelligent folk, seemed to have no operating concept
<br>
of probability or likelihood, of lines of reasoning, and of the
<br>
qualitative difference between knowing and merely &quot;believing&quot;.
<br>
It seemed that, short of knowing, most folk only recognized two 
<br>
other categories, that which they believed, and that which they 
<br>
did not believe. Some had trouble telling the difference between 
<br>
what they could legitimately claim to know vs what they just
<br>
believed.  
<br>
<p>Personally, I don't *know* for a fact that its not going to rain
<br>
here tomorrow, nor do I *know* that when I wake up the morning
<br>
that New Zealand (having heard certain propositions) isn't going
<br>
to launch a pre-emptive strike against the US, Europe and the 
<br>
Middle East simultaneously using trained kiwis carrying bioweapons.
<br>
Clearly all the many things that one does not *know* but can 
<br>
*conceive* of as possible are *not* equally plausible. But, if I think 
<br>
something is likely to be true, and, I try and talk about it to people
<br>
who are superstitious, (most of the world's population), and use the
<br>
word &quot;belief&quot; to acknowledge my lack of certainty, then, they will
<br>
possibly class my &quot;belief&quot; which being the result of extensive 
<br>
&quot;homework&quot; and analysis (sometimes) as being just another &quot;belief&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I would rather use words that they are not excessively familiar with. 
<br>
Say, perceive, suspect, think, reckon, deduced, inferred, analysed
<br>
etc, then they are going to find it a little bit harder to move onto 
<br>
their default view that one persons &quot;belief:&quot; is just as good as another.
<br>
This is clearly *not* the case. If they try and recouch or paraphrase
<br>
what I've said back to me as being a mere belief, then I can at least
<br>
see that they are doing it, and can choose to exercise the option to 
<br>
correct them and perhaps have a useful discussion, or not. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
For me, one merit of PCR is that it acknowledges that whilst one 
<br>
can't have certain knowledge about things, indeed one can't even
<br>
be absolutely sure that it is reasonable to have complete confidence
<br>
in reason (or rationality) as a process of finding truth, one can 
<br>
potentially differentiate between different degrees of uncertainty.
<br>
<p>When I go out in the world with my opinions, I *know*  :-) I will
<br>
encounter many people who are predisposed to think that all 
<br>
opinions are *only* beliefs and that therefore no view is ultimately
<br>
better than any other. And in democracies where one's &quot;fates&quot; is 
<br>
linked to choices and judgements of ones contemporaries and
<br>
majorities are still inclined to exercise veto powers on the basis 
<br>
of their beliefs, I reckon the view that all opinions are pretty much
<br>
equal or that one belief is as good as another is quite likely to
<br>
get me killed. Certainly, if I ignore it long enough, and maybe 
<br>
anyway. Still, I see no point in &quot;going quietly&quot;. I won't choose to
<br>
reinforce such a mistaken view. I'd rather work to ditch the word
<br>
belief from *my* working repertoire, with the view of propagating
<br>
the meme onward and hopefully making it harder for the majority
<br>
who are superstitious to stay that way and to kill me along with 
<br>
themselves. 
<br>
<p>IMO, &quot;beliefs&quot;, by their very nature, and as opposed to reasons,
<br>
are ultimately counter-social. They build barriers between people. 
<br>
Whereas reason through the medium of language can potentially
<br>
build bridges. To go for belief, when a line of reason is available; 
<br>
to take &quot;leaps of faith&quot; when none are unnecessarily, is to me, an
<br>
immature or immoral and anti-social act. Unless one has no choice.
<br>
In which case it is probably an a-social act. 
<br>
<p>If I could get others like me to purge the word &quot;belief: from their
<br>
language it would become easier to distinguish quickly who is doing
<br>
some thinking and who is not. At present loose language, like the
<br>
use of the word belief, means I can't always tell quickly whether or 
<br>
not the person I'm talking too converses daily with the supernatural.
<br>
Sadly extropes use the words belief and faith as shorthand as well.
<br>
(Maybe sometimes even as supernatural beliefs :&lt; ).
<br>
<p>I reckon that if the terms &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human being&quot; 
<br>
were all taken out of the repertoire of words that extropians choose
<br>
to use; if extropians, propagated the meme of not only not using 
<br>
them, but also of explaining why they should not be used to those
<br>
of like minds, and of challenging them (asking for clarification -
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;when you say xX - do you mean XX?&quot; etc) then that meme could
<br>
be propagated and become a powerful force in the shaping of 
<br>
political opinion. Alas, as has been pointed out elsewhere, points
<br>
about language, terminology, and the use and abuse thereof are 
<br>
often too subtle to be recognized as having the potency they do, 
<br>
even when the points are made by more articulate folk than myself. 
<br>
<p>Political opinion, imo, is not shaped mainly by two adversaries
<br>
having at each other, its shaped rather, in democracies, by how
<br>
the majority of non-combatants perceive the contest. This is why
<br>
its important to get one's terminology right. When one talks in 
<br>
terms of &quot;beliefs&quot; in general, and in the biotech sphere of &quot;human
<br>
&nbsp;life&quot; and &quot;human beings&quot; one is both conceding ground that 
<br>
should not be conceded and allowing oneself to be drawn into
<br>
word traps that the institutions that survive on superstition have
<br>
had many generations of experience in developing and refining.
<br>
<p>Napolean once said never interrupt your enemy whilst he's 
<br>
making a mistake. Perhaps the corollary is, one *should* 
<br>
interrupt one's allies when they are. Of course ones allies
<br>
are less likely to be compliant. 
<br>
<p>Please do consider ditching &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human
<br>
beings&quot; from your operating language when other terms are 
<br>
available. The rate of change in the free world, the rate of
<br>
extropic meme propagation in political systems, (your life),
<br>
just may depend on it such subtleties.
<br>

<br>
