<p><p><em>&gt; The first show &quot;Talking to the Dead&quot; took direct aim at psychics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who claim that ability.  Naming names and pulling no punches,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they took on Jonathan Edward (host of &quot;Crossing Over&quot;) and James
</em><br>
<em>&gt; von Praagh (host of &quot;Beyond&quot;) directly, showing how they used the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques of cold reading, how they gather information about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their audience from outside sources, how the shows are edited to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show only successes, and how they go out of their way to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scrutiny.  They even debunked the idea that they offer harmless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entertainment, with Penn Gilette offering a heartfelt tirade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how these con artists are robbing people of the honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories of their dead loved ones by filling their heads with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullshit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I can't believe it, How dare they try to show the world that these false hope 
<br>
giving leaches are fake. It outragous. They give truly gifted Psychics like 
<br>
myself a bad name. And before you say anything, I know what you are going to 
<br>
say, So don't.
<br>
<p>Just to prove that my paranormal abilities are real i'll prove it to you.
<br>
<p>Im picking up someone's name, someone on the list has something to do with 
<br>
the letter J.
<br>
And I can see a dog, Get DOWN, Stop THAT!  yes a black or dark coloured dog.
<br>
Im sensing that someone passed over before their time, quite suddenly. Maybe 
<br>
a car accident or near a road. 
<br>
Does this sound like you?
<br>
If so, reply offlist so I can edit your response and repost it as irrefutable 
<br>
proof.
<br>
<p>I hope they air the show in the UK. I've been telling my wife for years that 
<br>
'crossing over' is Bullshit.
