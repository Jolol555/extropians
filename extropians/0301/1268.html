<br>
&lt;&lt;Hmmm.  A dozen suicidal terrorists are &quot;a large faction&quot; of the 
<br>
Islamic population?  Islamic people are a larger group so it is 
<br>
ok to target them as a whole for destruction?  Jewish conspiracy 
<br>
theories are worth no more than other conspiracy theories are.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Try hundred of suicide bombers, if you wish to include what they do in 
<br>
Israel, and I do mean in Israel (pre 1967 borders).
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;So you admit your argument employed insane tactics?  And then 
<br>
you turn around and attempt to defend them with some weak news 
<br>
about a Nazi group allied with David Duke which you do not even 
<br>
bother to tie to those opposed to this particular war.  Why even 
<br>
bother with such a pointless response?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Many Muslims enjoy the relationship and propaganda styles of neonazis. I have 
<br>
witnessed this myself, upclose and personal. I will regard your 
<br>
characterization as specious, since I know the difference. Duke toured the 
<br>
Gulf states and addressed meetings that he was paid for by Islamic groups.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;Do you think that a war of extermination agains Islamic people 
<br>
per se is then justified?  Do you think the Muslims you flushed 
<br>
out on these chat groups are sufficient to decide such a thing 
<br>
against all of Islam?  Because much of your lingo has been a bit 
<br>
more wide than simply destablizing the Wahabbis and Ayatollahs. 
<br>
  It is that that worries me.

<br>
<p>Its what they (the Islamists) want. Please consider reading the literature 
<br>
they prodice on the internet. It is not the language of peace and our friend, 
<br>
Osama, is not the lone voice of a shrieking lunatic. His and other Islamsts 
<br>
words appear to have purchase in much of the Islamic world. They may be a 
<br>
minority, but surely not a small one. They also seem to have gained the upper 
<br>
hand in memes, overseas. If you agree that the Islamists are a threat, then 
<br>
its a matter of how to address the problem. If you see them as a minor issue. 
<br>
then one can conclude that you believe the deaths incurred on 9-11 were 
<br>
merely a fluke.
