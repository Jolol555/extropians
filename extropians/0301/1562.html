John K. Clark stated:
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;I don't buy it, Arabs were killing Jews long before Oslo and things were 
<br>
not very peaceful for the Israeli soldiers in Lebanon, in fact there has not 
<br>
been a time since Israel was created that Arabs were not killing Jews. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My guess is the Jewish population was too low to  win decisively, 
<br>
punishingly, where the Arabs would say: Oh my Gawd I can't stand this! Lets 
<br>
negotiate a peace. I think there were times that they were genuinely shocked; 
<br>
as in the 6-Day war in 1967. Soon after, there came an Arab tradition of 
<br>
poetry to deal with their despair at having lost to Israel. 
<br>
<p>My sense, is that the Arab Muslims never had any sense that the Israelis 
<br>
could damage all 250 million of them out (why would they want to?). Or 
<br>
rather, inflict &quot;unacceptable damage, as the Pentagon term bespeaks! If you 
<br>
believe that if you die in war, one one is ushered into a flesh;y paradise, 
<br>
&quot;unacceptible damage&quot; may have a quite broad meaning.
<br>
<p>But please remember, the same Islamic societies were beaten by France, the 
<br>
UK, and Italy in the 19th and 20th centuries. It does take political will to 
<br>
do it, and one has to decide if its worth it. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;That would mean driving millions of people from their home, again. I don't 
<br>
think that would foster goodwill.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My understanding is that there is no Good Will, nor is there likely to be 
<br>
Good Will. This  has become, for now on both sides, a sectarian fight. In 
<br>
Israel, Peace Now membership has completely dwindled to a few leftists. In 
<br>
the Islamic states, there never was, or has been, a Peace Now movement; 
<br>
although I notice that certain Palistinians get lynched by the PA 
<br>
occasionally, so maybe there are a few peaceniks among them? I suspect Israel 
<br>
will do all it can now, to separate each side, otherwise the murder and 
<br>
killing will continue. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I hope you're right and yes, the rational response would certainly be to 
<br>
just relax and enjoy all that money but I worry because people are not always 
<br>
rational.??&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Money can make people rational, as well as irrational. But I will suppose 
<br>
that the US using the CIA, will make sure everything is calm. Iran is a rare 
<br>
example of a people rebelling against modernization. Iraq, is at least 
<br>
somewhat different.
