<p><p>What many societies describe as &quot;good&quot; can often be explained as just a
<br>
<p>complicated form of &quot;has a better grip on reality&quot;.  Consider the
<br>
present war, cast not as, &quot;democracy vs. dictatorship,&quot; or, &quot;the West
<br>
vs. terrorists,&quot; but instead as, &quot;people who are willing to try whatever
<br>
works vs. people who follow one leader no matter what the cost,&quot; where
<br>
what works is stuff like debating issues in the open, preferring
<br>
scenarios where everyone lives to scenarios where your enemies die but
<br>
so do you, and perhaps beating down foreign governments sitting on a lot
<br>
of oil.
<br>
<p>At least to me, this adequately explains why &quot;terrorists&quot; are usually
<br>
unable to effectively use high-tech weapons, even when they manage to
<br>
purchase them.  Sure, just about anyone on this list could probably set
<br>
up something like what was suggested here if we were in Saddam's shoes,
<br>
with all the resources available to him.  But then, if we were in
<br>
Saddam's shoes, we'd be doing a bunch of other things differently, to
<br>
the point that we probably wouldn't have drawn the ire of heavily armed
<br>
nations in the first place - whether or not we explicitly tried to avoid
<br>
it.
