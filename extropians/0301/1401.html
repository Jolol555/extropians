<p><em>&gt;I don't recall 3000 Europeans perishing in one stroke of a attack by the
</em><br>
Red Brigades.
<br>
<p>I can't quickly find the current total death toll data from the WTC attacks,
<br>
but I do see this:
<br>
<p>&lt; According to Agence France Presse and the Associated Press, the following
<br>
changes in dead &amp; missing foreign citizens, dual nationals, resident aliens,
<br>
and undocumented immigrants (upward and downward estimates in parentheses)
<br>
have been reported as of 21 September: Out of 6333 reported missing by Mayor
<br>
Giuliani, 3870 are foreigners, 2463 are U.S. citizens. 20 September 2001. &gt;
<br>
<p>The attack was on our entire civilization, Mitch, not just on American
<br>
citizens. We all have a stake in this.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick
<br>
<p>[see, for further details, this, which needs to be compared with the final
<br>
figures that cut the death toll by half:]

<p>WORLD TRADE CENTER NON-US DEATH TOLL OUTNUMBERS AMERICAN
<br>
Wayne Madsen
<br>
<p>What is being largely lost in the grief and sorrow following the terrorist
<br>
attack on the World Trade Center is the fact that the current count of dead
<br>
and missing reveals more foreign nationals died in the attack than
<br>
Americans. Although the major media has reported that other nations lost a
<br>
number of their citizens, it is not being reported that their numbers, some
<br>
3061, are in excess of U.S. casualties, currently estimated at around 2589.
<br>
These figures do not include any Canadians who may have been lost in the
<br>
cataclysm. From information culled from a number of wire service accounts,
<br>
the estimates of dead and missing by country are:
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<pre>
----
Current &quot;dead and missing&quot; from New York Times, January 15, 2002:
Officials estimate that as of Monday, 3,114 people had died, or were missing
and presumed dead, as a result of the attacks on Sept. 11, not including 19
hijackers:
At the World Trade Center
2,890 dead or missing, with 147 dead on two hijacked planes.
At the Pentagon
184 dead or missing, with 59 dead on hijacked plane.
In Pennsylvania
40 dead on hijacked plane.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
Non-US dead or missing. Revised 14 January 2002
4,183 plus those missing and undocumented
