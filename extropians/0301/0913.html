<p><em>&gt; The US could lose the war, for instance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Saddam distributes his army in the cities, basically hiding behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children and women. The US forces would need to fight for each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every house.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if Saddam is smart (and there is no evidence he is) that will be his
<br>
strategy. There is one ray of hope, Saddam gives orders and people obey him
<br>
because they are frightened of him, when it becomes obvious he will lose the
<br>
war (and he will) that fear will evaporate. I just hope a lot of people
<br>
don't get killed before that happens. By the way this war will settle a
<br>
question I've wondered about, is a non nuclear electromagnetic pulse bomb
<br>
really a effective weapon? If it is and you start to fight house to house in
<br>
Baghdad now would be the time to use it. If it works as advertised nobody is
<br>
killed and communication among enemy troops drops to zero playing hell with
<br>
moral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. The US forces get too lax and make a mistake. Iraqi ground forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch a fast attack on Saudi/Kuwait territory, forcing the surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US forces into a large scale ground battle?
</em><br>
<p>I think that is very unlikely, surprise would be imposable and Saddam won't
<br>
be able to do anything fast, any moving vehicle will be pulverized from the
<br>
air.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;  awful oil prices like we have now are not good for the economy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and since Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world, and
<br>
possibly the largest since they have not been exploded nearly as much as
<br>
Saudi Arabia, and since oil production is cheaper there than anywhere else
<br>
on the planet, the oil being quite shallow, this war could very well lead to
<br>
a long term decrease in the price of oil.
