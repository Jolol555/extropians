<em>&gt;&gt; What do you some of you think of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and Extropianism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we leave out our dear ideas of weird
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms of reproduction (cloning, polyparents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; xoxing, random generation), child-rearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and an economic unit and instead look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the family as a social institution, it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the main property of the family is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong altruist bonds that are commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present. They can be explained socio-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biologically as the result of selection for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kin altruism. This makes the family a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network of trust and security (hardly every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family, but enough to matter).
</em><br>
<p>I would not define family as such -- not as &quot;altruist.&quot;  I believe the
<br>
confounding of &quot;altruism&quot; with family life here comes from the cultures
<br>
we live in and not any essential trait of families.  See below.
<br>
<p>Also, &quot;selection for kin altruism&quot; I'm not so sure.  You'd have to prove
<br>
the traits are genetically determined and variable.  I mean using
<br>
Horwitz's view of family, childless couples are families as would
<br>
couples with adopting children be.  Now, if they're selecting each other
<br>
because of some genetic trait they didn't directly inherit, the case
<br>
would still have to be proved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Transhumanism systematically problematizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human condition, asking about every human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trait: &quot;How could it be different? Could it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better? Can it be changed?&quot;. In the case of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family it is interesting to consider what happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if this altruism is removed or extended.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  I don't see altruism as a defining feature here.  People do
<br>
often live together as families for mutual benefit.  The childless
<br>
couple example -- which is, according to Horwitz, the dominant form of
<br>
family -- comes to mind.  You might reply that I'm extending family and
<br>
benefit beyond useful definitions, but that was Horwitz's example in the
<br>
former and I would point out that benefits can be long ranged and
<br>
non-monetary -- both of which I'm sure you'd agree on.  (I'm merely
<br>
explicating these for others to consider.  Others might point out that
<br>
for the egoist, family might be a very important value because she or he
<br>
has internalized the value of family.  That is, the good life for such
<br>
an egoistic family person would include family and many of its attendant
<br>
demands -- just as the dude who loves his rare stamp collection might
<br>
make _provisional_ sacrifices for it.:)
<br>
<p>Still, your questions are good.  I would add to this, since families
<br>
spontaneously evolved, under newer conditions, while I might expect
<br>
planning to play a role, the spontaneous ordering might continue along
<br>
different lines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Non-altruistic families would be essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the kind of economic units described in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper, producers of children, socialization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and economic interfaces. It doesn't sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very fun, and these functions could likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented by other market actors.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  I thought of the market absorbing family while I was reading
<br>
the paper.  It would be interesting to see if this were possible and it
<br>
would no longer be a family then, but a market order.  Also, even with
<br>
the market, there are institutions, as Horwitz points out, that exist in
<br>
the market yet are somehow not exactly the same as a market, such as
<br>
firms.  Firms exist despite the fact that many economists believe they
<br>
shouldn't.  (Frederic Sautet, on the other hand, argues that firms arise
<br>
through entrepreneurial action in his _The Entrepreneurial Theory of the
<br>
Firm_.  But my point is not so much to labor this particular example,
<br>
but to point out that the market might not absorb all social
<br>
institutions -- even ones specifically emerging from it.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
