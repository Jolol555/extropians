<p>Breezy, breezy, breezy. My use of the word &quot;almost&quot; slipped right by:

<p>When you have a teenager berate you for bringing her or him into the world,
<br>
you gain fresh access to grasp of the near-intolerability of which I speak.
<br>
<p>But when i look around, there's a lot of human &quot;expertise&quot; that seems to read:
<br>
<p>&quot;Kids? Nothin' to it! Fuck, squirt 'em out, wipe 'em off and then do whatever you want until they're
<br>
big enough to whup you rather than t'other way 'round. Wander off to die when they stop feeding you.&quot;
<br>
<p>I seek better than that. I'm sure you do too. It's not *you* I'm worried about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Edward de Bono has famously said &quot;Critical thinking is cheap thinking.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Lots of rhetoric, including pop-up Socratic dialogs, seems cheap to me, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socratic dialogues, especially those written by Plato, aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I'd call cheap, but each to his own taste.  As for critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking, I find it indispensable and am surprised you don't.
</em><br>
<p>You appear to be unfamiliar with de Bono--he likes to frame simple observations in provocative
<br>
(and thus memorable) ways--and you have apparently decided that &quot;cheap&quot;and &quot;indispensible&quot; are
<br>
somehow at odds. From this you think I find it dispensible. Adjectives are tricky. If you want to
<br>
compliment an Eames or Shaker chair, you can call it &quot;iconic&quot; or &quot;elegant&quot;; if you want to slam it
<br>
you can call it &quot;angular&quot; or &quot;rudimentary&quot;. What changed? Not the chair.
<br>
<p>Anyway: Air is cheap where I come from, as is water. Neither is dispensible, both have
<br>
advantages and limitations which are both neatly packed into the adjective. As another example,
<br>
most houses are built with cheap techniques. Even so, there are building codes.
<br>
<p>Now please consider: smarties and everyone else in this culture are taught habits of thought such that after
<br>
(1) rearranging one's prejudices (not really thinking much--jumping to conclusions, etc.), and
<br>
(2) critical thinking (which we do indeed observe is often not employed, een by smarties),
<br>
there is a huuuuge gap in difficulty (or at least, in frequency of employment).
<br>
<p>Typically, smarties feel smarter because they at least do (2), as well as (1). They are praised for it.
<br>
<p>Other kinds of thinking are readily seen to be less frequently fostered than either of the first two kinds.
<br>
de Bono slices thinking up 6 ways (the &quot;Six Thinking Hats&quot; of the eponymous book) to try to help promote
<br>
the conscious employment of more than just what the culture (especially the &quot;brainy&quot; subculture) holds up.
<br>
<p>de Bono suggests that cheap thinking of the form &quot;Find the fatal logical flaw, knock
<br>
the heresy down, and move on&quot; became ensconced in this culture around the time of Augustine--
<br>
because there were so many heresies and so little time. Cheap, in this context, maps well to &quot;efficient&quot;.
<br>
He's British-Maltese, so there's a little less of an onus on the word for him. &quot;Inexpensive&quot; doesn't have
<br>
qite the punch of &quot;cheap&quot;, though, and I believe he _was_ intending some provoation. Rightly, in so far as
<br>
I think a wise person must be aware of the limitations of critical thinking when used, e.g., as a club.
<br>
<p>Winning the argument being more important than finding the right goes back farther than that, though.
<br>
I include some of &quot;Socrates&quot; in that camp. Win the argument! NEXT! Do we seek the good, or the true?
<br>
Settle for winning the argument! NEXT!
<br>
<p>Houses and civilzations aren't built just by winning arguments. Even winning them brilliantly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, I would say that it's not reality that is inconsistent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is only our ideas and interpretations that can be.
</em><br>
<p>And our observations, and our categories.
<br>
<p>And thus, our rules and heuristics must be. Which is my point. I do agree that we should reduce this
<br>
tension when practical, rather than retreat to commitment, etc.
