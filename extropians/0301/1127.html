(sorry, this originally, accidentally went to wta-talk but was supposed to
<br>
go here. Cross posting is bad!)
<br>
<p>I think that if you are talking about a posthuman world (Eliezer will slap
<br>
me, consider me slapped already ok), then you'd want to do away with
<br>
representative democracy altogether.
<br>
<p>Instead, my vague notion is that, where you need government, full direct
<br>
participation is the go. You have groups like commitees for all the
<br>
different functions of government, influencing and directing each other in a
<br>
complex and self evolving web. Posthumans would, as far as they would care
<br>
to, directly participate for as long as they cared to, in the areas of
<br>
interest to them; no barriers to entry. Assuming that a posthuman mind is a
<br>
vast and fragmentable thing, a posthuman could devote more or less mental
<br>
resources to each area of interest/concern, and exercise some kind of
<br>
proportional power in the group.
<br>
<p>Ideas like specialisation, modularity, and simplicity of organisation do
<br>
tend to go away (or recede) in the face of vastly increased intelligence; if
<br>
all players can comprehend an entire complex networked social environment
<br>
all at once, the need for central control goes away.
<br>
<p>Representative democracy is a least worst system, where communications
<br>
bandwidth &amp; latency is poor (compared to thought, say), and where the
<br>
sentient beings involved are mentally quite limited (single gepographical
<br>
location, ability to simultaneously attend to a few things at most, etc).
<br>
The idea of a few making decisions for the many, in the future world of
<br>
unchained cognition, makes little sense.

<em>&gt; Solar system government? Yes, but decentralized, with very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful and very small array of local governments (including

</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom to pass through zones. Freedom to enter permanently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be subject to majority agreement or unaminous blocking. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universal base level human and sentient rights ought to

</em><br>
