<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin was Balanced and Even Handed, and concluded:

<em>&gt; &gt; Ah, phooey!  Iraq will get its just desserts
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; What are Iraq's `just desserts'?  As many posters here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have also noted, the fact that the Iraqi regime is vile,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous and a possible threat to its vile and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous neighbors...
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I should have said &quot;the Iraqi regime will get
<br>
its just desserts&quot;.
<br>
<p>You've just stated exactly why it (hopefully) will
<br>
get what it deserves.  All such despicable governments
<br>
should have such a fate!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...in no wise distinguishes it from many other nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently clients of the USA (many of them, in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the vile and murderous neighbors of Iraq).
</em><br>
<p>I don't know---on the list of despicable regimes, which
<br>
others in the Middle East rate with Iraq's?  I've seen
<br>
reports about what Saddam and his son enjoy doing to
<br>
people in the dungeons, and have heard (on this list too)
<br>
the appalling record of their crimes.  So what others are
<br>
as bad?
<br>
<p>But beyond giving a cruel tyranny what it deserves, there
<br>
are the issues of
<br>
<p>(a) non-proliferation
<br>
(b) support for terrorists
<br>
(c) monopolistic control of oil
<br>
(d) breaking treaties and agreements
<br>
(e) ignoring U.N. security council
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resolutions
<br>
<p>Besides those, I'll freely admit that if the Iraqi regime
<br>
does get overthrown, it will be a good object lesson all
<br>
around to other &quot;vile and murderous&quot; nations, who may be
<br>
more fearful in the future as regards (a), (b), (c), (d),
<br>
and may also fear getting in the eyes of the West a bad
<br>
reputation on rights abuses---which might even be called (f).
<br>
<p>Even if the United States was completely sinister, it would
<br>
be vastly, vastly harder for it to organize an overthrow
<br>
without the help of (a), (d), (e), and (f).  I cannot imagine
<br>
any regime in the world that was
<br>
<p>&nbsp;*  decent to its citizens
<br>
&nbsp;*  not trying to build weapons of mass destruction
<br>
&nbsp;*  not providing support for terrorists of various kinds
<br>
<p>possibly being invaded by the U.S./O.K.. and friends.
<br>
<p>Lee

<p>P.S.  I hereby copyright the above &quot;U-SUK&quot;, and
