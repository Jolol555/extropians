<p><em>&gt; People /do/ spread those kinds of lies, and worse, every day.  And the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remedy for bad speech is /more/ speech, not suppression by force.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...  But if all they do is speak, all I can do is speak in return,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hope that humans with reasonable minds judge us both reasonably.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [The] contention that any kind of speech must be suppressed is typical of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left-wing hopeless pessimism that humans are weak and ignorant and can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly judge ideas for themselves, so they must have the &quot;right&quot; ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced upon them, and be &quot;protected&quot; from dangerous ones.  I for one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a bit more respect for human minds than that.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess I don't have &quot;any more respect for human minds&quot; 
<br>
than the leftists do.   ;-)   Humans *are* weak and ignorant,
<br>
and rarely judge ideas for themselves.
<br>
<p>The problem is that non-libertarians leap from this to the
<br>
hideous conclusion that The Government is wiser and more just;
<br>
that if we simply elect &quot;the right&quot; people to rule, then the
<br>
weakness and ignorance of common people will be corrected.
<br>
The lessons of history that prove that the power so created
<br>
is abused go unheeded---there are always more people who
<br>
intuit that &quot;The Government&quot; can make things right.
<br>
Using force, naturally.
<br>
<p>Kai retorts:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If therefore someone uses this human behaviour
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to damage someone [else's] reputation by telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lies about him, this can have drastic as well as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle consequences for the victim.
</em><br>
<p>That's quite true, of course.  The question is whether
<br>
to allow it to continue to be a war of words, or whether
<br>
force should be used to settle the dispute.  Those 
<br>
countries with the longest democratic traditions have
<br>
found that it's better NOT to use force, but rely 
<br>
instead on the natural evolution of reputations,
<br>
naturally developing skepticism, and increased
<br>
sophistication.
<br>
<p>Moreover, I surmise that many people, including many on
<br>
this list, have a not-so-secret longing for the use of
<br>
force.  From my point of view, it's quite child-like;
<br>
instead of recognizing the superior resorts available
<br>
within a law-abiding society (that guarantees free
<br>
speech), there seems to be to them something almost
<br>
sexy about solving the problem by draconian action.
<br>
It's almost as if there were an agent in their minds
<br>
saying &quot;why fool around with half-way methods that
<br>
might be ineffectual, when government force can simply
<br>
mandate what is desired?&quot;
<br>
<p>Curiously, when we move the discussion to the lawless
<br>
international realm---where there is no common culture
<br>
promoting individual rights and freedom of expression
<br>
---the roles often reverse.  People who believe in the
<br>
use of force to maximize what is desirable within a
<br>
democratic society shun its use on the international
<br>
scale.  Very interesting.
