*** I'd like to thank my friend Mike for posting the first part of my 
<br>
response to Jeff. Here is the entire rebuttal, beginning with Jeff's 
<br>
assessment of my last post.
<br>
<p><p>This is in response to a MaxPlumm BBS message
<br>
forwarded by Michael Dickey. 
<br>
<p>In his message MaxPlumm misquotes, misinterprets,
<br>
misattributes, and assigns meanings unsupported by the
<br>
text and unintended by the writer. The result is a
<br>
tangled mess unqjust barely resembling a coherent
<br>
argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Jeff, ...I must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take issue with a large portion of your argument.
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0861793.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0861793.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note the following excerpt:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Mar., 1946, France signed an agreement with Ho
</em><br>
Chi
<br>
<em>&gt; Minh, recognizing Vietnam as a free state within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indochina federation and the French Union. ...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; # I find it fascinating that you, or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically your source, cut off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the statement here. In full, it continues
</em><br>
<p>****IT DOES NOT CONTINUE**** as you state. You cite
<br>
an entirely different source. Everyone makes
<br>
mistakes, but this subject is difficult enough without
<br>
blunt misattribution. 
<br>
<p>***Perhaps your understanding of the english language is lacking, Jeff, but 
<br>
Webster's College Dictionary, Third Edition, defines statement as: &quot;a written 
<br>
or spoken declaration&quot;. I am referring here to the DOCUMENT SIGNED BY HO CHI 
<br>
MINH AND JEAN SAINTENY IN PARIS IN MARCH OF 1946. The website you use as a 
<br>
source quotes directly from this document. But it, and you, do not include 
<br>
the entire article of this document. The document does say, as you quote,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In Mar., 1946, France signed an agreement with Ho Chi
<br>
<em>&gt; Minh, recognizing Vietnam as a free state within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indochina federation and the French Union. ...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>***But then, THE DOCUMENT FROM WHICH THIS WEBSITE QUOTES CONTINUES ON THE 
<br>
VERY NEXT LINE…
<br>
<p>In that which concerns the reuniting of the three 'Annamite Regions' 
<br>
(Cochinchina, Annam, Tonkin) the French Government pledges itself to ratify 
<br>
the decisions taken BY THE POPULATIONS CONSULTED BY REFERENDUM.
<br>
<p>That is article one of the document in its entirety. The entire document can 
<br>
be found, among other places, in Frederik Logevall's &quot;The Origins of the 
<br>
Vietnam War&quot;, p. 100
<br>
<p>So, once again, there were no such referendums ever held. Therefore, this 
<br>
document is a dead letter. So, before you magically wave off an argument that 
<br>
challenges your position, let us be perfectly clear on this. I am quoting 
<br>
from the document itself, not &quot;some other source&quot; as you claim. Are you 
<br>
somehow suggesting that your website which edits the document takes 
<br>
precedence over the document signed by Ho Chi Minh himself?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I direct your attention to that last bit: &quot;...Vietnam,
</em><br>
of which Cochin China was then recognized to be a
<br>
part.&quot; So from 1949 to the onset of the Geneva
<br>
Conference, Vietnam was all of Vietnam, the combined
<br>
regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China. 
<br>
<p><p>***These are YOUR WORDS, taken from your first response to me. Now, you 
<br>
clearly state that as of 1949 Vietnam was all of Vietnam. This was achieved 
<br>
through the Elysees Agreement, signed by French President Vincent Auriol and 
<br>
Bao Dai. This document acknowledged Bao Dai as chief of state in Vietnam. It 
<br>
was ratified by the French Government on March 12, 1949. If you accept that 
<br>
this agreement made Vietnam one nation, THEN  you must also recognize Bao Dai 
<br>
as chief of state. Though you seem to enjoy picking and choosing which parts 
<br>
of documents you wish to use, it only diminishes your already weak argument.  
<br>
<p><p># You have previously stated that the 1946 agreement
<br>
<em>&gt; that Ho Chi Minh signed with Jean Sainteny was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally binding force with regard to Vietnam,
</em><br>
<p><p>Quote me if you wish. And then offer interpretations
<br>
of the quote if you wish. But please refrain from
<br>
putting words in my mouth. I made no such comment. I
<br>
referenced the document to show what was going on at
<br>
one moment in time. The document is a document, and
<br>
as such is regarded by various persons in a manner of
<br>
their choosing. The document had some force and
<br>
effect. Exactly what, is subject to interpretation. 
<br>
<p>***In what sense? The 1946 agreement was not ratified, nor were the terms 
<br>
agreed to ever carried out. The 1949 Elysees Agreement was ratified, and 
<br>
signed by the French President. Under any criteria, it had more &quot;force and 
<br>
effect.&quot; So, if you are not basing Ho's &quot;legitimacy&quot; on the 1946 agreement, 
<br>
what do you base it on? 
<br>
<p><p>You state above, about the document: &quot;the agreement
<br>
that you base your assertions upon was never ratified
<br>
by the French government...&quot;
<br>
<p>It is my impression that ordinarily when a governement
<br>
gives its representative in a negotiation the power to
<br>
make an agreement, then the agreement is binding. At
<br>
least to the degree that any government considers
<br>
itself bound by any agreement it signs.
<br>
<p>***Yes, I would think a government would consider itself bound to an 
<br>
agreement, IF THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WERE CARRIED OUT. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet here, you acknowledge the legitimacy of the 1949
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elysees Agreement between Bao Dai and French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Vincent Auriol,
</em><br>
<p>I didn't even mention--much less acknowledge any
<br>
possibility of legitimacy regarding--that instrument
<br>
of recalcitrant colonialism. 
<br>
<p>***Again, either you have an incredibly limited understanding of this 
<br>
subject, or you are deliberately playing dumb. Let us go back to your own 
<br>
words, lest you accuse me or some vast &quot;anti-communist conspiracy&quot; of putting 
<br>
them in your mouth:
<br>
<p>I direct your attention to that last bit: &quot;...Vietnam,
<br>
of which Cochin China was then recognized to be a
<br>
part.&quot; So from 1949 to the onset of the Geneva
<br>
Conference, Vietnam was all of Vietnam, the combined
<br>
regions of Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China.
<br>
<p>***You unmistakably define Vietnam as being one nation after 1949. Therefore, 
<br>
you acknowledge the Elysees Agreement. Therefore, you acknowledge Bao Dai as 
<br>
head of state. If you do not understand what you are writing, that is not my 
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p># Again, if there are any errors or lack of facts
<br>
here, it is clearly on your side of the discussion. 
<br>
<p>So you assert, but the documents--but more to the
<br>
point, the untortured facts--tell another story.
<br>
<p>***It is laughable, at best, that you attempt to justify your position 
<br>
through said documents when you don't even realize that web sites are quoting 
<br>
from them. Speaking of &quot;untortured facts&quot;, you did a marvelous job of not 
<br>
responding to any of my specific allegations of North Vietnamese violations 
<br>
of the Geneva Accords. As witty as your  &quot;bomb the hell out of people&quot; line 
<br>
was, you did not answer my questions. For starters,  why would David 
<br>
Chandler, a left of center Australian academic with no love for the United 
<br>
States government, state emphatically in his biography of Pol Pot that the 
<br>
Khmer Rouge victory &quot;was unthinkable&quot; without North Vietnamese aid?
<br>
<p>Additionally, you also said it was obvious that Ho would win, because &quot;he won 
<br>
independence for his country.&quot; Amazing, here I thought it was the 
<br>
indispensable Chinese and Soviet aid, that the French didn't even know the 
<br>
Viet Minh possessed, that won the day in the First Indochina War. But then, 
<br>
any suggestion that Ho was a communist is mere &quot;anti-communist 
<br>
fundamentalism&quot; in your mind, and we know that when Jeff waves his magic 
<br>
wand, all other arguments disappear.
<br>
<p>Your favorite devout anti-communist,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
<br>
<p>At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with 
<br>
America and little that is right.
