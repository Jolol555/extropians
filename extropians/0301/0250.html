<br>
understand how you consider the North Vietnamese government under Ho a 
<br>
morally sound one.
<br>
<p>Good question, Michael.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old Granddaddy told me that if I was in North America and heard the 
<br>
thunder of pounding hooves I was to expect to see horses not zebra.  Jeff 
<br>
gives me a long reading assignment after which I will be enlightened inre the 
<br>
origins of the Vietnamese War -- I will have proof that the refugees did not 
<br>
flee the North because of suppression.  But I ask myself is Jeff the one 
<br>
arbitrator of truth in the Universe.  Is a list of books handed me by Jeff 
<br>
less likely to misrepresent the truth than all the newspapers I read at the 
<br>
time?  Does it take longer to simply report what is observed or to twist &amp; 
<br>
invent observations to fit a conclusion?  Here we are forty-five years after 
<br>
the facts and Jeff has his story straight.  If I let him explain it all to me 
<br>
I will too.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I ask myself did those Vietnamese refugees I worked with have 
<br>
their stories straight?  Did they leave Vietnam and brave the dangers they 
<br>
braved just because they found that workers paradise boring?  Were they tired 
<br>
of living among family &amp; friends until they had to leave loved ones behind 
<br>
and go live with strangers?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where should I insert the testimony of Tom Dooley?  He reported what 
<br>
he was seeing week after week.  He eventually gave his life to help South 
<br>
East Asians.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, one book written by an Indian Diplomat trumps all that.  I should 
<br>
be ashamed to think any of those sources were telling the truth.  Jeff, who 
<br>
would provide his gentle guiding hand to capitalism, will set me straight.  
<br>

<br>
<p>BTW, Michael did you ever hear Jeff say why those Roman Catholics couldn't 
<br>
say a mass in the north of Vietnam?  How about all those Buddhists that came 
<br>
with them?  Were they allowed their temples and practices?
