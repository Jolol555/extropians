<em>&gt; &gt; Do I understand you [Lee] correctly as saying that no such thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as &quot;natural rights&quot; based on the nature of sentient beings such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as ourselves, exists?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Worse yet, is he suggesting that we should surrender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any claim to our natural right to his or someone else's decision?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not.  I just wish I knew what you were talking about.
<br>
I feel like I did as a little boy in Sunday School when they
<br>
kept talking about the Trinity.  Now God, and Jesus, I understood.
<br>
But what was this Holy Ghost thingy?  Surely (though I did not
<br>
possess the vocabulary at the time) it was a figure of speech.
<br>
Like &quot;there was a spirit of happiness at the party&quot;.  SURELY
<br>
THESE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ADULTS DID NOT BELIEVE IN A TRUE GHOST!
<br>
<p>Oh, but years later I learned, yes they did.  Well, maybe not
<br>
the liberal-cum-atheists in the Methodist Church, but the true
<br>
Trinitarians did and do.
<br>
<p>What is a natural right?  Who issued it?  From whence does
<br>
it come, or emanate?  Surely it cannot be found anywhere 
<br>
the way that real laws can (i.e., recorded in statutes).
<br>
For example, it's not been found in our DNA, nor does it
<br>
show up in anthropological studies.  What the hell are we
<br>
talking about?
<br>
<p>When I say &quot;certainly not&quot; above, I mean that I have no
<br>
intention of surrendering any of my legal rights as a
<br>
citizen of a Western nation.  (While under the circumstances
<br>
I do not believe that John Ashcroft and his ilk have gone
<br>
too far yet, the further that they do go, the more I will
<br>
resist.)  On many other fronts, Western governments, including
<br>
the U.S.'s, have indeed gone way too far, as any libertarian
<br>
will agree.
<br>
<p>So what is this about &quot;natural rights&quot;?  Am I blind to something?
<br>
<p>Lee
