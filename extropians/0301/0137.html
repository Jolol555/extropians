</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not really that the race is more susceptible to sickle cell anemia,
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Race&quot; is tricky to define. Many people would claim they know it when
<br>
they see it. And it more or less matters (or doesn't) to them. Not all
<br>
would have the same thing in mind when they talk about race and this
<br>
is part of the problem.
<br>
<p>One of the books I quite enjoyed reading was Brian Sykes &quot;Seven
<br>
Daughters of Eve&quot;. Sykes uses mitochondrial DNA (or rather vary
<br>
small changes to the mitochondrial DNA) which is passed through
<br>
the maternal line to produce a maternal family tree of &quot;Europeans&quot;.
<br>
He thinks he can trace all people of European decent back to seven
<br>
particular women, the farthest back being 45,000 years ago.
<br>
<p>Jump across to Africa and the ancestral mothers go back much further.
<br>
<p>Populations and &quot;racial&quot; groups have been mixing to varying extents
<br>
throughout history and I find the idea that we may be able to increasing
<br>
trace our geneologies back way before recorded history using the
<br>
mitochonrial DNA from the maternal line and they Y chromosome from
<br>
the paternal line fascinating.  We are likely to find that most of us,
<br>
indeed
<br>
all of us, will turn out scientifically, to be &quot;family&quot; in the broadest
<br>
sense of
<br>
the word. That notion might make for a nice extropic meme.
<br>
<p>Of course, and this is particularly, pleasing this is going to make those
<br>
who are blatantly and obnoxiously racist have to come to terms with in
<br>
many cases some surprising facts about their own relatively recent
<br>
geneology. Many wll find for instance that at some time in the last thousand
<br>
years they may have had an ancestor in exactly that nearby region that
<br>
thing they most despise. People will find out (possiblty) that hating the
<br>
enemy bizarrely turns out to be akin to hating oneself.
<br>
<p>There is however legitimate and more pressing reasons for studying
<br>
population genetics. Its hard, now ethically, to justify making small
<br>
genetic changes in the germline deliberately to see the differences that
<br>
result and the advantages that are conferred in the phenotypes exspressed so
<br>
doing
<br>
a bit of geneological archeology can be a good way of finding out about
<br>
what genetic diseases may be caused. You start with an obvious phenotype
<br>
and work back to see if there is a genotype difference (considering say
<br>
the people of Iceland) and then maybe you get an understanding of how
<br>
the genes influence different. One you know more about the genes that
<br>
cause disease there are a variety of approaches you can take to devising
<br>
therapies for those that suffer from genetic diseases to giving parents who
<br>
may have say the genes for haemophilia the choice as to whether to have
<br>
daughters rather than sons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it's a defese created due to the factors of the environment, which is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic. The sickle cell gene provides some protection against malaria. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in areas where malaria is common, evolution decided the protection it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides against malaria offsets the damage done my sickle cell anemia.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it is genetic mechanisms not the superficially obvious local population
<br>
differences that tend to confer advantages for particular environments. But
<br>
the superficially obvious population differences can give some indications
<br>
of
<br>
where to look for promising sets of genes.
<br>
<p>As you say trading environments cause genes that are trade off
<br>
susceptibility for malaria against susceptibility for anemia. It turns out
<br>
to be the same gene.
<br>
<p>But its a useful insight (for therapies) to know what the gene is. And the
<br>
study
<br>
of populations can be a good way of shortlisting the search for beneficial g
<br>
enes (bearing in mind) genes aren't good or bad in themselves (the sickle
<br>
cell/anemia tradeoff) its still nice to be able to make choices about
<br>
treatments and tame some of natures random affliction of unnecessary
<br>
suffering if we can..
<br>
