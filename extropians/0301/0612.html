<p>
INTRODUCTION
<br>
<p>The Extropian Principles 3.0 &quot;express the values and attitudes
<br>
common to Extropians&quot;. (pg 13). They have been structured 
<br>
and version numbered to reflect the desirability of their being 
<br>
reflected upon and reviewed from time to time by extropians.
<br>
<p>The Extropian Principles are copyright to Max More, therefore
<br>
actual changes to the document itself may be best carried out,
<br>
facilitated, or at least consented to by Max.
<br>
<p>I offer for your consideration, and discussion, the following
<br>
amendment requests - marked AMENDMENTS below.
<br>
<p>PROCEDURE: (Please read in deference to others)
<br>
<p>The proposals are numbered for ease of reference and to facilitate
<br>
clarity in discussion. The proposed amendments may be supported
<br>
opposed or ignored. Amendments to these amendments may be
<br>
offered (alternate substitute wording say might be offered).
<br>
<p>Other amendments to other parts of the ExI Principles could also
<br>
be offered, however, I request that these be handled separately
<br>
(i.e.. use a different subject header) so that at least temporary closure
<br>
on these particular issues which have already had some discussion 
<br>
on the list can be achieved.
<br>
<p>Please don't put meta-commentary in posts that are about votes and the
<br>
particular amendments, put it in a side post, so that the particular 
<br>
amendments can be considered separately on their merit. If you have
<br>
no interest or preference at all saying nothing will be very concise and 
<br>
might make it easier to count votes and for other people to see alternative
<br>
amendments if any.
<br>
<p>If more than say a dozen respond, ( if :-)  ), it may be better to send
<br>
yes or no votes (on each or all of the amendments) to me offlist and I'll
<br>
collate them and report to the list.
<br>
<p>Any other procedural questions could be handled by use of a META
<br>
in the subject line.
<br>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<br>
<p>I acknowledge and thank Lee Corbin and Samantha Atkins for their
<br>
discussion relating to these matters to date.
<br>
<p><p>AMENDMENT (1) -------------------------
<br>
<p>In two places in the Extropian Principles 3.0 reason is said to be
<br>
*favored*.
<br>
<p>The second sentence on page 1 states:
<br>
<p>(1a)
<br>
&quot;Like humanists, transhumanists *favor* reason, progress,
<br>
and values centred on our well-being rather than on any
<br>
external religious authority&quot;
<br>
<p>And, the last sentence on page 2 states:
<br>
<p>(1b)
<br>
&quot;7. Rational Thinking -- *Favoring* reason over blind faith and
<br>
questioning over dogma&quot;.
<br>
<p>PROPOSED AMENDMENT 1a and 1b
<br>
<p>(1a)
<br>
<p>That the word *favor* be replaced with the word *affirm*
<br>
<p>(1b)
<br>
<p>That the word *favoring* be replaced with the word *affirming*
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;OPENING ARGUMENT.
</em><br>
<p>One ought not merely favor reason over belief like one favors
<br>
say vanilla ice cream over peppermint. Such is not an intellectual
<br>
distinction. One ought to &quot;affirm&quot; reason over belief.
<br>
<p>I note that the word affirm is used on pg 12 in the first sentence of
<br>
the section on Rational Thinking in exactly this manner.
<br>
<p>**AMENDMENT (2)---------------------------
<br>
<p>On page 3. Following immediately after the above ref in Amendment 2.
<br>
<p>&quot;Remaining open to challenges to our *beliefs*(2a) and practices in
<br>
pursuit of perpetual improvement. Welcoming criticism of our
<br>
existing *beliefs*(2b) while being open to new ideas&quot;.
<br>
<p>PROPOSED AMENDMENT 2A and 2b
<br>
<p>(2a)
<br>
&quot;Remaining open to challenges to our *assumptions* and
<br>
practices in pursuit of perpetual improvement.
<br>
<p>(2b)
<br>
Welcoming criticism of our existing *views* while being open
<br>
to new ideas.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;OPENING ARGUMENT
</em><br>
<p>Neither of the proposed alternative words to *beliefs* carry any
<br>
implication that *beliefs* are valid.
<br>
<p>If the intended meaning of these sentences can be retained without
<br>
any risk of implicitly endorsing the belief meme the net effect of the
<br>
amendments are beneficial. The Extropian Principles should not
<br>
implicitly affirm belief.
<br>
<p>AMENDMENT (3)---------------------------------------
<br>
<p>On pg 2.
<br>
<p>&quot; This document deliberate does not specify particular *beliefs*,
<br>
technologies, or conclusions. &quot;
<br>
<p>PROPOSED AMENDMENT 3.
<br>
<p>No change is proposed.
<br>
<p>However some opposed to the other related amendments may wish to
<br>
strengthen the belief meme or propose a counter-point amendment.
<br>
<p>No restriction on the nature or extent of opposition is implied.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; OPENING ARGUMENT.
</em><br>
<p>In this context *belief* is not endorsed. In fact it seems to be
<br>
disparaged. It is a good example of opposing of the *belief* meme
<br>
that competes head to head with the *reason* meme.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Footnote:
<br>
<p>I am aware that this sort of procedural approach is
<br>
more often used in national governments (where there
<br>
is better infrastructure to support it) than on mailing
<br>
lists and that this approach may be perceived as, or
<br>
actually be, &quot;over the top&quot;.
<br>
<p>Yet it seems that to build high requires strong foundations
<br>
and the Extropian Principles are our foundations. They are
<br>
what others may look to when they seek to know what it is
<br>
that extropians stand for. Some others may also look for
<br>
inconsistencies in the ExI Principles as an indication as to how
<br>
cogent or otherwise is extropian philosophy.
<br>
<p>Others can hardly be expected to take us more seriously
<br>
than we take ourselves when we are considering serious
<br>
matters.
<br>
<p>If this matter (belief vs. reason) proves to be of no interest
<br>
to the group I will respect that disinterest and pursue it no
<br>
further.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
