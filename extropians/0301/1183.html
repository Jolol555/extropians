<em>&gt; Samantha asked:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;Is the point lost on you that at one time some powerful nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and groups said similar things about the Jewish people?  It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very dark road that you are contemplating.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yah! But the Jews were and are tiny compared to a billion Muslims, and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large fraction of Jews never felt so threatend by democracy, that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became kamikazi attackers (9-11). As Bernard Lewis aptly stated: &quot;The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wahabbis as if the American KKK inherited oil fields.  Powerful nations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Europeans) still hate Jews but let the North Africans (as in France) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry out the violence-all they while pretending to &quot;deplore&quot; it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laughable ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  A dozen suicidal terrorists are &quot;a large faction&quot; of the 
<br>
Islamic population?  Islamic people are a larger group so it is 
<br>
ok to target them as a whole for destruction?  Jewish conspiracy 
<br>
theories are worth no more than other conspiracy theories are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;This is utterly ridiculous.  You claim those who do not want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this very questionable war, much less your even broader
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conception of it are thereby &quot;Leftists&quot; (whatever the hell that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his in your mind) or &quot;Pro-Nazi&quot;?  Do you honestly believe any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sane person will accept such an argument?&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, sanity seems never to be an issue as far as winning arguments go. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, yes, the neonazi National Alliance party in Cleveland, and their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involvement with David Duke, who just completed a speaking tour in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuwait, Abu Dabai, Bahrain etc.; before he was sentenced to prison for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embezzling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So you admit your argument employed insane tactics?  And then 
<br>
you turn around and attempt to defend them with some weak news 
<br>
about a Nazi group allied with David Duke which you do not even 
<br>
bother to tie to those opposed to this particular war.  Why even 
<br>
bother with such a pointless response?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;&lt;You are categorically opposed (apparently) to the existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large number of others!  You are very hypocritical in this.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish to cast all of this in terms of those opposed to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence and the existence of your people.  Consider for just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment that this is not so.  At the very least admit the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that those that disagree with you are not out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exterminate you and your people even when and if you advocate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extermination of others.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After meeting so many Muslims in Yahoo chat, I am, as the lawyers say, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, that, at least they know what they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want. Chiefly, the destruction of my peeps, which they are quite ardent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about; and the ruination of the USA, which they seem even more motivated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward.  I am emphatically not, trying to seek a moral highground, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely realize that these fellows want a war of extermiation. Passivity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not my orientation, so basically I am in favor of destabling the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wahabbis, the Ayatollahs and the like. I see no other choice, knowing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I believe I know, rather then just what I feel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you think that a war of extermination agains Islamic people 
<br>
per se is then justified?  Do you think the Muslims you flushed 
<br>
out on these chat groups are sufficient to decide such a thing 
<br>
against all of Islam?  Because much of your lingo has been a bit 
<br>
more wide than simply destablizing the Wahabbis and Ayatollahs. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is that that worries me.
