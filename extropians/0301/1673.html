<p>
There are so many viable options that do not involve war.  We are an
<br>
inventive species and I don't think this problem, philosophically or
<br>
practically, necessitates war.  If you want to offer a proof that states the
<br>
opposite I'd be glad to investigate it.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Suffice to say that establishing with absolute certainty the option of
<br>
maximal efficiency is out of both of our ranges.  With that as a starting
<br>
point I won't categorically say that war is not the best option I just
<br>
think, based on limited information and cognitive power, that we can do
<br>
better.  As transhumanists/extropians we find ourselves dreaming of
<br>
immortality and so many of us are still calling for a bayonet to be shoved
<br>
in the gut of those who threaten us.  Threats can be dealt with in so many
<br>
ways.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What would a containment strategy cost in dollars and in dangers.  Why
<br>
couldn't we send in a force of 50,000 UN inspectors instead of our Armies
<br>
with the option of leaving them there as long is it (whatever we determine
<br>
it to be) takes.  Why should we think that 100 or 1,000 inspectors is
<br>
anywhere near enough. If this level of force were to occupy Iraq - hiding,
<br>
working on and deploying any weapons of mass destruction would become a
<br>
dramatically more difficult option. If Iraq mistreated any of these
<br>
inspectors UN judgment would quickly find agreement and other action could
<br>
be taken.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Combine containment with a massive Marshall program in Afghanistan to help
<br>
modernize the country and educate its people.  We'll make sure that
<br>
Al-Jazeera is kept up-to-date on all the improvements were making and how
<br>
happy the citizens are to have running water, air-conditioning, education,
<br>
democracy and freedom.  In the meantime we'll continue massive propaganda
<br>
attacks on the minds of the Iraqi's and let them know that if they overthrow
<br>
Saddam we'll Marshall plan them too and let them run their own country - not
<br>
just install some puppet.  Of course these don't seem to be very likely
<br>
options but it doesn't mean that the sane and reasonable shouldn't argue for
<br>
them in the face of war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
War seems like such a dangerous option for so many reasons:
<br>
Why martyr Saddam?
<br>
Why invite counter-attack from Iraq?
<br>
Why invite counter-attack from the Islamic world (didn't someone say
<br>
&quot;Crusade&quot;)?
<br>
Why continue a cycle of violence and death when we are so close, as a
<br>
species, to finally cutting our biological ties to death - when will we cut
<br>
the sociological/psychological ties?
<br>
Why undermine the UN when there is no more important time for a credible and
<br>
effective world government to emerge?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In short I believe that we can find a better, more effective way to spend
<br>
$200 billion and still create acceptable levels of peace and security.

people that have victimized them and others in the past.  Is that what you

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me what do you intend to do to guarantee our safety Dr.

Broderick -- other than write emails encouraging us to not protect

ourselves?  We know that in your humble opinion we are in no danger -- but
<br>
we find no comfort in your words, we want action.  What are you going to do
<br>
other than advise impotence in the face of a threat?
