<p><em>    &gt; The only two places?  What about from 10km with a B747 ABL,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the airborne laser?
</em><br>
<p>That might work very well against short range scuds and would have been
<br>
helpful in the 91 gulf war, but it's of no use against a ICBM because Russia
<br>
won't let you fly your 747 around Siberia 10 km from the launch point.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt; would  give the attacker some real headaches, especially considering
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; he knows he only has 35 minutes to live after squeezing off
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; a missile.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Missile defense is certainly a difficult problem, but we
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; should not declare it impossible.
</em><br>
<p>As long as it take a dollar's worth of defensive hardware to shoot down 5
<br>
cents worth of offensive hardware a practical ICBM defense will be
<br>
impossible and I don't see that changing anytime soon because shooting down
<br>
a ICBM is fundamentally more difficult that sending a ICBM.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; the Muslim extremists would be tempted to  deliver a nuke by missile
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;if at all possible.
</em><br>
<p>I can't imagine why they would want to go to all the trouble of delivering
<br>
their nuke by missile when they could send it by Federal Express. The
<br>
problem is not missiles the problem is nuclear bombs. Every day thousands of
<br>
huge cargo containers enter America and almost none of them are searched in
<br>
any way. Searching them all would be enormously expensive, perhaps 2% of
<br>
what has been proposed for SDI, but would increase national security far
<br>
more than that boondoggle.
