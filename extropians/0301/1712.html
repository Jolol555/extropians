<p><em>&gt; I have just joined extropians and I'm pleasantly surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the range of topics here.
</em><br>
<p>Welcome!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope I'm not too off topic by contributing to this thread but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is one of my favorite subjects...
</em><br>
<p>Hardly.  This is so totally &quot;on-thread&quot; I can't believe it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Anyhow, about the price of oil, one big factor in price is taxes.  No surprise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there. However I suggest that the relationship might be a little different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than one might first assume.  Huh?  Surely if you tax oil, the price goes up. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps, perhaps not.  Here is my reasoning:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.    Tax oil *at the barrel* (i.e. not at the pump)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ii.   Prices of oil based products; fuel, plastics, etc. naturally rise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iii.  Alternatives to oil-based products appear a little cheaper. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       I.e. wood or metal instead of plastic, bicycling instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       driving etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iv.   Some consumption shifts away from oil to alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; v.    Demand for oil decreases slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vi.   To maintain revenues, oil producers drop prices a little (*)
</em><br>
<p><em>        &gt; (*) Of course they could increase prices but remember there
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; really is a free market at work in the oil arena.  If one
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; producer increases price they are likely to see market share fall.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds how the equilibrium should work, theoretically.
<br>
One has to ask, why didn't they drop the prices a little to
<br>
begin with, and sell more?  The answer should be, &quot;because
<br>
it would have been slightly less profitable.&quot;
<br>
<p>Okay, so far you have increased the tax on oil, but the
<br>
key has to be in your step (vi).  It's not clear that
<br>
the oil producers *can* maintain the same revenue. Consider
<br>
the reductio ad absurdum:  if an incredibly heavy tax were
<br>
applied, then production would have to stop altogether.
<br>
<p>So I don't understand (vi), because I don't see why the oil
<br>
producers wouldn't have increased production in the first place,
<br>
given that they do have at their disposal your option (vi) of
<br>
maintaining the same revenue at lower price.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, assume for a minute that the increased tax revenues taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in by taxing the oil are used to displace some other tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yes, yes, an unlikely scenario). Then:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a.   The nation sees no net change in the tax burden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b.   The nation sees a net decrease in the price of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c.   The oil producing country has a little less income from oil
</em><br>
<p>Now you are saying that the &quot;oil producing country&quot; is
<br>
not the same as the hypothetical country taxing and
<br>
consuming the oil.  But if we are talking pure economics
<br>
here, why should that matter?  You have also, by taking
<br>
this route, introduced the possibility of international
<br>
competition:  by taxing the incoming oil, the consuming
<br>
country's products may be less competitive over all.
<br>
<p>In short, I've gotten very confused!  ;-)  Mind starting
<br>
over?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The net effect: a reduction in the price of oil from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nation's perspective.  I.e. by taxing crude oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an oil-importing country can trim some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; windfall profits from the oil exporting country.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Windfall profits *going* to the oil exporting country&quot;
<br>
I take you to mean.  But &quot;windfall profits&quot; don't
<br>
theoretically take place because:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For the above reasoning I am not considering transient effects. Transient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects and unintended consequences might include things like decreased 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic activity, political unrest, me having to sell my beloved gas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guzzling SUV etc...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A fun thought experiment eh?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, quite.  Such thought experiments may allow me to know
<br>
how all this works!  Thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The best evidence in support of this argument are some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the strong statements the oil producing countries (especially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OPEC) make against consumer countries taxing oil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matt
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course they would make such statements.  But isn't
<br>
the reductio argument above enough to see why?  Western
<br>
governments *could* simply tax incoming oil so greatly
<br>
that it can't be imported at all except for those industries
<br>
that use it in only very small quantities.
