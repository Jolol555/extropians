<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It will be tragic if the cloned children suffer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from medical problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But we don't stop people with hereditary illnesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from having children,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and their kids also face an increased risk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, there is an emerging body of civil law in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wrongful birth&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suits.  They're not yet common, but some courts have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognized the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic principle that parents have an ethical duty to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of creating a child who will suffer from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their negligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm all for stem cell research, and any embryo or
<br>
early-fetus cloning associated therewith, but I don't
<br>
see reproductive cloning of a human as justifiable
<br>
until it is at least as safe as natural reproduction. 
<br>
When germline engineering and/or cloning become
<br>
distincly safer, then it will be interesting to see
<br>
how the 'naturalists' justify continuing with the
<br>
'unsafe' natural methods.  Kind of like the Christian
<br>
Scientists depriving their children of lifesaving
<br>
medical techniques.
<br>
<p>For the Raelians, I'm thinkin' a criminal charge of
<br>
&quot;reckless endangerment/disregard for human life&quot;,
<br>
independent of the condition of the child, based on
<br>
problems observed in non-human cloning.  Plus an
<br>
accompanying civil suit for support and medical care
<br>
for the lifetime of the child, plus punitive damages. 
<br>
Clonaid is probably a separate legal entity from the
<br>
Raelians, so the criminal and civil actions should
<br>
charge both, as co-defendants. Everything depends on
<br>
the jurisdiction.  Since the reports indicate the
<br>
Raelian 'clinic' is in South Korea, it would help to
<br>
know something about South Korean law.   
<br>
<p>Also I want to go on the record as thinking the
<br>
Raelian claim is a hoax.  They said they would prove
<br>
their claim in eight days or so.  I predict some
<br>
excuse--safety or privacy concerns of mother or child,
<br>
perhaps--precluding the Raelians from providing the
<br>
evidence.  Then they will continue with the claims and
<br>
continue with the excuses.  
<br>
<p>Finally Dr. Antonori, or someone else will succeed and
<br>
provide proof, and the Raelians will fade from the
<br>
spotlight.  
<br>
<p>I think the Raelians are announcing now solely to cash
<br>
in on the immense publicity.  They heard Antonori say
<br>
he would have a human clone by January, and they
<br>
didn't want the non-entity status that goes with
<br>
coming in second.
<br>
<p>That's my guess.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
