<p>
&lt;&lt;The major religions unquestionably
<br>
all have atrocities that were committed for their
<br>
beliefs and their beliefs alone. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Unquestionably.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It sounds as if you
<br>
suggest they might have done this in China, but as my
<br>
knowledge (which is admittedly weak on the subject)
<br>
stands, it was far more complex.  I also would say it
<br>
doesn't quite parallel if the religious communities
<br>
were documentably causing strife in the 'workers
<br>
paradise' so that their reasons for purging them in
<br>
the name of communism would atleast be logical (not
<br>
defending them or claiming that this was in fact the
<br>
case).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It was done on Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist-Maoist principles; where are 
<br>
organically, involved with &quot;socialist doctrines.&quot;  One removes the outside 
<br>
threat to the state and party rulership, and one defeats those forces which 
<br>
detract from &quot;scientific socialism&quot; 
<br>
which is antithetical to religious beliefs. What I am saying is these guys 
<br>
(the commies) were atheists, amongst other things. 
<br>
<p>It might be fair of you to say: &quot;Because Hitler loved to eat cream pastries, 
<br>
we should all disdain from such desserts. But I would argue, that atheism, as 
<br>
an ideology, is more than incidental to the communist movement.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;To clarify the intent in my question I've actually
<br>
noticed a rising number, in america, of hostile
<br>
athiests, as it has spread heavily into the
<br>
disenfranchised youth.  I'm utterly amazed that no one
<br>
has gone out yet and burnt a church or mosque down in
<br>
the name of athiesm and thought maybe it was just my
<br>
naivete that I've not found these cases yet.  
<br>
Also take note, I'm not defending &quot;my group&quot; as I
<br>
don't consider myself an atheist.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Atheists tend to come from homes and geography's in which they have been 
<br>
pressured, from childhood to conform.  The Christians have been more then 
<br>
heavy-handed in their approach, and in many cases, have been intolerant of 
<br>
other beliefs--no surprise on my part!  I would contend against the notion 
<br>
(not yours) that the Born Agains are merely warmed over kluxers (my 
<br>
expression-not yours). Many are people who need social and psychological 
<br>
support and have found it, in the focus on the J-man.  Most Church-Burners 
<br>
(and synagouge-burners) have been &quot;nominal-Christians), those attend Church, 
<br>
maybe once a year, or twice on Easter.  
<br>
<p>My sense is the young, alienated, Atheist, is more likely to take to art and 
<br>
music to declaim his disdain for conventional Christianity. Goth-Punk and 
<br>
Marilynn Manson grunge is my best guess.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;
<br>
Now a question for you.  You have said repeatedly of
<br>
the dangers of the islam in the war threads, no?  And
<br>
suggested it justifies bombing them as long as the end
<br>
brings less intolerance.  So, wouldn't this be killing
<br>
in the name of &lt;insert whatever religion or lack of
<br>
you support&gt; to the same extent as those who saw
<br>
religion as a direct threat to their communo-paradise.
<br>
How would this be distinct from what the communists
<br>
supported?  Or perhaps, is it different?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think I am not wrong in seeing what Islam has been transformed into, as a 
<br>
result of its inability to tolerate representative government. Turkey is the 
<br>
chief exception to the rule, and even here, it has been a very ill-liberal 
<br>
democracy (republic). Yet amongst the Islamic states, its been party-rule by 
<br>
clans, tribes, dynasties; that are scarcely different from the Europe of the 
<br>
17th century.
<br>
<p>I guess that the United States, because of 9-11, has been awakened to the 
<br>
deadliness of militant Islam, and its intolerance. The uniformity of behavior 
<br>
whether, militant Islam is in the majority or minority, seems clear. If there 
<br>
was another faith or ideology that was proving as aggressive (nasty) I would 
<br>
seek to dissuade them as well, from attacking the US or its allies. The 
<br>
Peoples Republic of China may eventuate into such an additional threat. But, 
<br>
one catastrophic threat at a time please!
