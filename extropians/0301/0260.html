<p>&quot;Sirtuin protein has a new function; May play role in lifespan extension
<br>
Scientists from Johns Hopkins and the University of Wisconsin have
<br>
discovered that a protein called Sir2, which is found in nearly all living
<br>
cells, has a new function that might help explain how calorie restriction
<br>
can increase lifespans for some animals, the scientists say. Their report
<br>
appeared in the Dec. 20 issue of Science. 
<br>
A number of laboratories have shown that restricting total calorie intake
<br>
extends the lifespans of organisms ranging from yeast to laboratory
<br>
animals. Others have shown that this effect requires Sir2's protein family,
<br>
called sirtuins, and increased cellular respiration, which is the process
<br>
of using oxygen to convert calories into energy. 
<br>
<p>Studying bacteria, the Johns Hopkins-Wisconsin team has discovered that
<br>
sirtuin controls the enzyme that converts acetate, a source of calories,
<br>
into acetyl-CoA, a key component of cellular respiration. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Sirtuins are highly conserved across species, but this is a
<br>
never-before-described ability of the protein,&quot; says Jef Boeke, Ph.D.,
<br>
professor of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins' Institute for
<br>
Basic Biomedical Sciences. &quot;If sirtuins modify this enzyme in other
<br>
organisms, turning on production of acetyl-CoA, it could help explain why
<br>
restricting regular sources of calories -- sugars and fats -- leads to
<br>
extended lifespan in many kinds of organisms.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Identified in all living creatures, including single-celled organisms like
<br>
bacteria and yeast, sirtuin proteins previously were known to play an
<br>
important role in keeping regions of chromosomes turned off. By modifying
<br>
the histone proteins that keep DNA tightly coiled, sirtuins prevent certain
<br>
regions of chromosomes from being exposed to cells' DNA-reading machinery. 
<br>
<p>Sirtuin's new role in bacteria involves the same modification as its
<br>
interaction with histone -- removing an acetyl group, a &quot;decoration&quot; added
<br>
to a protein's sequence (like phosphate) -- but the targeted protein is
<br>
involved in producing energy, not controlling chromosomes. 
<br>
<p>Normally, cells can survive by using many different molecules as sources of
<br>
energy -- potent sources like fats or sugars, or even relatively
<br>
energy-poor molecules like acetate. 
<br>
<p>However, Jorge Escalante-Semerena and Vincent Starai of the University of
<br>
Wisconsin created a strain of bacteria missing its sirtuin protein and
<br>
noticed that it couldn't live on acetate. Boeke had previously noticed that
<br>
yeast without sirtuin had the same problem, so the researchers dug deeper. 
<br>
<p>They discovered that the sirtuin protein in bacteria is a crucial modifier
<br>
of an enzyme known as acetyl-CoA synthetase, which converts acetate into
<br>
acetyl-CoA in a two-step process. Acetyl-CoA then can directly fuel the
<br>
citric acid cycle, the central energy-producing step in cellular
<br>
respiration. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This is a completely new target for the sirtuin protein,&quot; says Boeke, who
<br>
has been studying &quot;transcriptional silencing&quot; -- sirtuin's previously known
<br>
role -- for some time. &quot;Converting acetate isn't the cell's only way of
<br>
making acetyl-CoA, but when acetate is the major energy source, it's
<br>
crucial. Now we have to check for this role in other organisms.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The Wisconsin researchers found that sirtuin activates the first step of
<br>
acetate's conversion, and Boeke and Johns Hopkins' Robert Cole and Ivana
<br>
Celic figured out that sirtuin does so by removing an acetyl group from a
<br>
lysine in the enzyme's active site. 
<br>
<p>While bacteria and yeast are both single-celled critters, yeast are much
<br>
more closely related to animals, including humans, than are bacteria. If
<br>
the yeast version of sirtuin also modifies the newly identified target,
<br>
that would more likely reflect the protein's role in animals and would more
<br>
formally link the protein to lifespan extension, at least for yeast. The
<br>
effect of calorie restriction on the lifespan of bacteria has not been
<br>
established.
