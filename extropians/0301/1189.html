<p>&quot;Do you think that you are inside of my head, &quot;sir&quot;?  Do you believe for a
<br>
moment that you understand the deep abhorrence I felt from watching the
<br>
horror of Vietnam, what it did to this country or those who came back
<br>
mangled in body, mind or spirit many of whom I knew and dealt with
<br>
personally?&quot;
<br>
<p>I notice you say nothing of *that* country, only this country and these
<br>
people.  What of the 50,000 North Vietnamese peasants killed?  The 1 million
<br>
South Vietnamese?  The 2-3 million cambodians?  More civilians and
<br>
combatants were killed in Korea than in Vietnam, wheres the outcry over
<br>
that?   
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------
<br>
<p>Perhaps of all countries, democide in Vietnam and by Vietnamese is most
<br>
difficult to unravel and assess. It is mixed in with six wars spanning 43
<br>
years (the Indochina War, Vietnam War, Cambodian War, subsequent guerrilla
<br>
war in Cambodia, guerrilla war in Laos, and Sino-Vietnamese War), one of
<br>
them involving the United States; a near twenty-one year formal division of
<br>
the country into two sovereign North and South parts; the full communization
<br>
of the North; occupation of neighboring countries by both North and South;
<br>
defeat, absorption, and communization of the South; and the massive flight
<br>
by sea of Vietnamese. As best as I can determine, through all this close to
<br>
3,800,000 Vietnamese lost their lives from political violence, or near one
<br>
out of every ten men, women, and children.1 Of these, about 1,250,000, or
<br>
near a third of those killed, were murdered.

<p>Democide in Vietnam, 1.7 million people killed
<br>
<p>The Vietnamese communists had a simple plan for establishing themselves in
<br>
power: kill anyone who opposed them. They implemented this plan in 1945 and
<br>
have continued using it to this day. 
<br>
<p>Apart from the normal, workaday murder of fellow communists, the Viet Minh
<br>
slaughtered non-communist politicians and sympathizers by the thousands,
<br>
including in this class- and therefore murdering as well- the friends,
<br>
family members, and children of their political enemies. 
<br>
This killing continued with the establishment of communist North Vietnam in
<br>
1954, while the new power of state allowed for additional forms of murder as
<br>
well. 
<br>
<p>The class of landlords was targeted. When it was discovered that this class
<br>
did not exist in any meaningful sense, the communists redefined &quot;landlord&quot;
<br>
to mean anyone with an above average income (say, an extra cow), or anyone
<br>
who once upon a time had an above average income, or anyone whose ancestors
<br>
had had an above average income. The lower class peasants were instructed to
<br>
choose which of their fellow villagers fell into this category, and kill
<br>
them. The central government laid down a death quota- 5 percent of the
<br>
population of each village were to be killed. From 1953-1956, an estimated
<br>
150,000 people were killed in this manner. Peasant rebellions that followed
<br>
these extermination campaigns were suppressed, at the cost of an additional
<br>
10,000 lives.
<br>
<p>In 1957, the communists began to supplement the domestic death toll with an
<br>
active campaign of murder in the South. This campaign was highly selective,
<br>
being directed against those individuals who were capable of mobilizing
<br>
opposition to the communists. This could include, not just the outspoken
<br>
anti-communists, but anyone who exhibited skill or competence, whether a
<br>
government official or a civilian. In the countryside, village leaders were
<br>
murdered, disrupting the traditional social structure. Communist guerillas
<br>
listened in on the classrooms, and when they found teachers who were not
<br>
sufficiently sympathetic, killed them too. 
<br>
<p>In this way, from 1957 into the early 1960s, the communists denuded South
<br>
Vietnam of those individuals who could provide effective leadership, who
<br>
could forge resistance among the people, or who could inoculate the children
<br>
against communist lies and propaganda. The number of people killed in this
<br>
campaign has been estimated at around six to seven thousand. This is a
<br>
comparatively small number, but it was precisely those few thousand who
<br>
could cause the communists the most trouble. To the communist,
<br>
egalitarianism does not mean everyone is equal. It means those who are
<br>
superior can be rounded up and shot. The murder campaign put this theory
<br>
into practice. 
<br>
<p>In America, President Kennedy was very clear about America's role in Vietnam
<br>
- assist the South Vietnamese in their war, without fighting it for them. In
<br>
1964 President Johnson reversed this policy. Americans have been very
<br>
creative in explaining this change, but the most compelling reason may have
<br>
been the success of the North Vietnamese murder campaign. The South
<br>
Vietnamese could not fight their own war- they no longer had the able
<br>
officials and competent leaders to do so, this apart from the fact that
<br>
their top level government was totally unstable. The South was heading
<br>
towards collapse. Without direct American intervention, Vietnam would fall,
<br>
and the communists, enthused by the success of their murder campaign, could
<br>
very well have repeated it elsewhere. But instead, the murder campaign led
<br>
to a massive American invasion. 
<br>
<p>This did not mean the campaign came to an end. On the contrary, it continued
<br>
with greater force than before. In the years of direct American involvement
<br>
in the war, the South Vietnamese singled out and murdered because of their
<br>
anti-communism, their association with anti-communists (as friends or
<br>
family), or simply because of their competence and ability, numbered in the
<br>
tens of thousands. 
<br>
Alongside this assassination campaign was a more general terror campaign. An
<br>
entire village might be massacred, breeding fear in other villages. Roads
<br>
used by the civilian population would be mined. Buses would be ambushed with
<br>
machine guns and mortar fire, residential neighborhhods were shelled, for no
<br>
other purpose than to kill innocent civilians. Refugee camps were attacked
<br>
as a matter of policy. 
<br>
All told, through assassination, terrorism, and massacre of civilians and
<br>
prisoners of war, the communists killed an estimated 164,000 non-combatants
<br>
in South Vietnam. 
<br>
<p>The killing did not end with the the surrender of the South in 1975. War and
<br>
rebellion continued in Vietnam, costing an estimated 160,000 lives. Vietnam
<br>
was invaded by both Cambodia and China, costing tens of thousands of lives.
<br>
In turn, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and Laos. The total killed in battle is
<br>
estimated at 149,000. A staggering 3 million people may have been killed in
<br>
foreign democide, including those killed by Vietnamese puppet regimes. 
<br>
<p>Vietnamese concentration camps, called &quot;re-education camps,&quot; left perhaps
<br>
95,000 people dead. Deportations to &quot;new economic zones&quot; left some 48,000
<br>
people dead. The number of people simply rounded up and shot for whatever
<br>
reason has been estimated at 100,000, with much higher estimates coming from
<br>
various sources. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps the best way to gauge the true nature of the murderous peace in
<br>
Vietnam is the vast number of people who, having tolerated decades of war,
<br>
risked their lives to flee the unmitigated brutality of communist rule. The
<br>
&quot;boat people,&quot; refugees who attempted to escape by sea, numbered in the
<br>
millions. An estimated 500,000 of these people drowned trying to escape.

<br>
<p>Ho Chi Minh
<br>
<p>Ho Chi Minh, the long-lived dictator of North Vietnam, was a loyal Stalinist
<br>
throughout his life. He attended the founding congress of the French
<br>
Communist Party in 1920, acquired a revolutionary education in Moscow during
<br>
the early 20's, and served as a Comintern advisor in China until 1927.
<br>
<p>During World War II, he fought the Japanese in China and in Vietnam,
<br>
proclaiming himself leader of a provisional government in 1945. His
<br>
following at this stage was still small, but over the course of a nine-year
<br>
guerrilla war against the French, Ho crushed internal opposition in order to
<br>
make himself the Stalin of Vietnam: 
<br>
<p>As the Viet Minh struggled against the French, they also fought a vicious
<br>
hidden war against their noncommunist nationalist competitors. They
<br>
assassinated, executed, and massacred whole groups of nationalists,
<br>
including relatives, friends, women, and children.
<br>
Nationalists were not the only victims: &quot;class enemies&quot; were also
<br>
&quot;punished,&quot; and communist ranks were purified of Trotskyites and others who
<br>
deviated from accepted scripture. Thousands among the most educated and
<br>
brightest Vietnamese were wiped out in the years 1945 to 1947 that it took
<br>
the communists to firmly establish their power. (R.J. Rummel, Death By
<br>
Government) 
<br>
<p>After French defeat, Ho followed standard Communist operating procedure.
<br>
First, kill off peasant leaders and better-off peasants to decapitate future
<br>
peasant resistance; then forced collectivization can proceed unhindered.
<br>
Slave labor camps sprang up, as did show trials. By all accounts several
<br>
hundred thousand people perished during the 1953-1956 period. The Geneva
<br>
Agreements divided Vietnam into the northern region held by Ho, and the
<br>
southern region outside of Communist control. The people of Vietnam voted
<br>
with their feet.
<br>
Tallies for 1953-56 speak volumes: about 1 million northerners chose to flee
<br>
south, while only one-tenth as many southerners chose to flee north. 
<br>
<p>Ho began guerrilla war against South Vietnam almost immediately. The war
<br>
escalated quickly; with South Vietnam close to defeat in 1964, the United
<br>
States joined in the war to prop up the failing government of South Vietnam.
<br>
This delayed the North's victory for about ten years. Throughout the war,
<br>
both North and South Vietnam engaged in large-scale killing of civilians.
<br>
The United States did so as well, although it appears that more effort was
<br>
made to avoid civilian targets than in World War II. 
<br>
<p>Ho was dead of old age by the time Communist forces triumphed in 1975, but
<br>
the post-war atrocities were in his Stalinist tradition. Slave labor plus
<br>
brain- washing yielded the infamous &quot;re-education camps&quot; to which
<br>
anti-Communists, dissidents, former civil servants of South Vietnam,
<br>
prostitutes, and others were condemned. The death rate of the hundreds of
<br>
thousands of inmates in these camps was high. Fear of these camps led to the
<br>
exodus of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese of makeshift boats; many of
<br>
these refugees perished at sea. Even Vietnamese who escaped the re-education
<br>
camps were often deported to the country for milder slave labor in the &quot;new
<br>
economic zones.&quot; The post-war executions, concentration camps, and
<br>
deportations probably produced several hundred thousand additional deaths. 
<br>
A final major atrocity of the Vietnamese Communists began in 1979. The Khmer
<br>
Rouge, a Cambodian Communist faction, had been in power since 1975.
<br>
Relations between the Vietnamese Communists and the Khmer Rouge were however
<br>
hostile. Vietnam invaded and quickly defeated Cambodia in 1979, revealing to
<br>
the world the ghastly killing fields of the Khmer Rouge. Now that the
<br>
Vietnamese were in charge, however, mass murder was merely curtailed rather
<br>
than abolished. The Vietnamese puppet ruler, Heng Samrin, was himself merely
<br>
a dissident member of the Khmer Rouge, so what else could be expected?
<br>
Supported by Vietnamese troops, the Samrin regime exterminated perhaps an
<br>
additional half million Cambodians.
<br>
<p>The following is Uwe Siemon-Netto's mea culpa to the English magazine
<br>
Encounter,1979: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Having covered the Viet Nam war over a period of five years for West German
<br>
publications, I am now haunted by the role we journalists have played over
<br>
there. Those of us who had wanted to find out knew of the evil nature of the
<br>
Hanoi regime. We knew that, in 1956, close to 50,000 peasants were executed
<br>
in North Vietnam. [As Nguyen Manh Tuong stated at the 1956 National Congress
<br>
in Hanoi: 'It is better to kill 10 innocent people then let one enemy
<br>
escape.'] We knew that after the division of the country nearly 1 million
<br>
North Vietnamese had fled to the South. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Many of us have seen the tortured and carved-up bodies of men, women and
<br>
children executed by the Viet Cong in the early phases of the war. And many
<br>
of us saw, in 1968, the mass graves of Hue, saw [take note, Mr Patterson]
<br>
the corpses of thousands of civilians still festively dressed for Tet, the
<br>
Vietnamese New Year. Why, for Heavens sake, did we not report these
<br>
expressions of deliberate North Vietnamese strategy at least as extensively
<br>
as of the Mai Lai massacre and other such isolated incidents that were
<br>
definitely not part of the U.S. policy in Viet Nam? 
<br>
<p>&quot;What prompted us to make our readers believe that the Communists, once in
<br>
power in all of Viet Nam, would behave benignly? What made us, first and
<br>
foremost Anthony Lewis, belittle warnings by U.S. officials that a Communist
<br>
victory would result in a massacre? Why did we ignore the fact that the man
<br>
responsible for the executions of 50,000 peasants, Truong Chinh, was - and
<br>
still is - one of the most powerful figures in Hanoi? What made us think
<br>
that he and his comrades would have mercy for the vanquished South
<br>
Vietnamese? What compelled, for example, Anthony Lewis shortly after the
<br>
fall of Saigon to pat himself on the shoulder and wri'e, &quot;so much for the
<br>
talk of a massacre?' True, no Cambodian-style massacre took place in
<br>
Vietnam. It's just that Hanoi coolly drives its ethnic Chinese opponents
<br>
into the sea. That's what Nasser threatened to do to the Israelis, no
<br>
massacre intended, of course. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Are we journalists not in part responsible for the death of the tens of
<br>
thousands who drowned? And are we not in part responsible for the hostile
<br>
reception accorded to those who survive? Did we not turn public opinion
<br>
against them, portraying them, as one singularly ignoble cartoon did in the
<br>
United States, as a bunch of pimps, whores, war profiteers, corrupt generals
<br>
or, at best, outright reactionaries? 
<br>
<p>&quot;Considering that today's Vietnam tragedy may have a lot to do with the way
<br>
we reported yesterday's Vietnam tragedy; considering that we journalists
<br>
might have our fair share of guilt for the inhuman way the world treats
<br>
those who are being expelled by an inhuman regime which some of us had
<br>
pictured as heroic, I think at least a little humility would be in order for
<br>
us old Viet Nam hands, Mr Lewis included. And if I did not strongly believe
<br>
in everybody's right of free expression at any time, I would even admonish
<br>
him to keep quiet about Indo-China, at least for a while&quot;.
