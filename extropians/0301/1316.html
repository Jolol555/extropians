&lt;&lt;The main reason those troops are still here, is because of obvious 
<br>
tactical advantages to the US foreign policy.
<br>
regards Max M Rasmussen, Denmark&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If we look at the old threat of the Soviets sending their tank armies across 
<br>
the Fulda gap you will recall what NATO was.  The German leftists (who have 
<br>
now taken power and seem to represent the opinions of the German voter) 
<br>
protested during the 70's and 80's that having US Troops was a provocation, 
<br>
and that Deutschland would be the battleground, as a result. The other side 
<br>
of the coin was that if it was; the war would quickly escalate and go 
<br>
nuclear, and transcontinental. Mutually Assured Destruction.  My point is 
<br>
that the USA had as much to lose as the Germans did, so why I asked myself, 
<br>
need we risk our lives for a bunch of folks who hate the US?
<br>
<p>The question sort of made sense back 20 years ago, and it makes some sense 
<br>
today.  Actually the real trigger for war would've been American weakness and 
<br>
not as the song indicated 99 Luft Balloons.
