<p><em>&gt; It seems like your vote is &quot;it depends&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't mean to be harsh, disrespectful or unkind,
</em><br>
<p>You don't seem to be capable of it in any way :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but sometimes one just *has* to make a decision.
</em><br>
<p>Oh absolutely.  But I imagine that I score *very*
<br>
highly on decisiveness.  I'm always the first one
<br>
at dinner who knows what he wants to eat, and it
<br>
drives me crazy how everyone else ums and ahs
<br>
over the delectables.  I was just presenting
<br>
the factors that might influence me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Your remarks about the infant Lee Corbin are pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unnecessary.  OF COURSE one does not *start* in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way you describe.  Not even in geometry!!  You could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; try to read what is written a little more charitably?  ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No offence was meant. I apologise if I was insensitive.
</em><br>
<p>Boy, are we miscommunicating!  Here I meant to reprimand
<br>
you for stating the obvious, and you took it that I was
<br>
offended.  How on Earth could one be offended by your
<br>
example?  Oh, never mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In what respect are you *with me*?  What do you take to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; my main contention in this thread (that you are with me on)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, I think that you were criticizing those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;start&quot; from a position of faith or belief in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justifying their conclusions, as you wrote above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. I'm cautioning extropians, transhumanists, free thinkers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and anyone who I think shares my goals (pretty much the ExI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principles and wants to actually see them realized in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political world), to be aware that whenever *we* use the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word 'belief' *we* are affirming the validity of that meme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which competes head to head with the meme of &quot;reason&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone who happens to be listening.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I had misunderstood you.  Of course, many of us
<br>
still don't agree with your conjecture here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the meme of &quot;belief&quot;. It will also be easier for us to point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to observers (voters) where our opponents are using the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief in a completely unwholesome way if we haven't muddied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up the discourse by using it in a different (but perhaps not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticeable different to the observer/voter) way ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've proposed as a practical step that we replace the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief with alternatives of the same meaning in the ExI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principles.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I haven't heard anyone second the motion, but
<br>
you are welcome to keep trying!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But by your use of the word &quot;axiom&quot; I also inferred,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps incorrectly, that you also had a problem, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do, with those who would try to rigorously deduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from some small set of principles everything they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe---sorry---everything that they endorse.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not your &quot;main contention&quot;, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not completely sure I am clear what you are saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here and I don't want to speculate. Perhaps in another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My confession of &quot;suffering is bad&quot; as being sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; axiomatic is only that this is a meme up against which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my thoughts frequently bump.  It's sort of a &quot;hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principle&quot;.  But I've always had better sense than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to begin a Euclidean program on it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I reckon a Lee Corbin clone would possibly give you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hard time over the phrase &quot;sort of axiomatic&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, yes, I could have spent some time polishing that
<br>
sentence....but by God it would have meant the same
<br>
thing!  
<br>
<p>Look, Brett, if I had said &quot;quasi-axiomatic&quot; it would
<br>
have passed your filters, no?   You are IMO way over-
<br>
reacting to particular words, rather than the ideas
<br>
and thoughts behind them.
<br>
<p>Lee
