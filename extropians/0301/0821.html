<em>&gt; Thank you for the Hayek site. I have bookmarked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>My pleasure.  There are also links to Hayek papers online there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The PB copy of Road to Serfdom soon tore up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I am looking (in vain so far) for a hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backed copy to replace it.
</em><br>
<p>It's beyond my ken how people tear up books.  I generally keep mine in
<br>
good shape -- even though I have almost no intention of ever selling any
<br>
of them.  I also rarely reread books, though sometimes I do use them for
<br>
reference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find so much that relates to events around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me that my copy will never be a collectors copy.
</em><br>
<p>Hayek's book does, though, I must confess, I did not like it when I read
<br>
it.  His style leaves a lot to be desired and I already knew many of his
<br>
arguments at that time.  (I read it in my first year of college.  I was
<br>
turned on to Objectivism and libertarianism in my junior year of high
<br>
school.  For those of you outside the States, that's two years before
<br>
college.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, have you heard the Sufi story that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one sufi ever reads a copy of a Sufi book
</em><br>
<p>No.  I could lie and say I have, but what would be the point?:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- They read that one copy to death.  That is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am about my Road to Serfdom except that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have never gotten to the end of it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't believe all wisdom is contained in any one book -- or if
<br>
it is that book might be something like that infinite library in the
<br>
Borges story.  However, I get your point.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
<p>Dan
