<p><em>&gt; &gt; Then why doesn't everything we do---since we are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; biological organisms---fall under this rubric?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; E.g., Adolph Hitler had a natural right to feed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upon all his countless victims.  We are, after all, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speaking scientifically here.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Why don't you try this test: does this natural right help me to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive as a man?  Now, I will argue that if you attempt to feed on other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people as Hitler did that effort will be counter to your survival.
</em><br>
<p>But that brings time, progress, and culture into it again.
<br>
I'm sure that you will admit that under some common historical
<br>
situations feeding on other people as Hitler did was very
<br>
*conducive* to survival, e.g., Montezuma or Stalin.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thanks for that!  It perfectly illustrates the error unmistakably.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're quite welcome, Lee.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think however that the passage above illustrates your error rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than Thomas Jefferson's. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excuse me for standing up for one of our most famous presidents in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history, but I think your assertion in opposition to Jefferson's is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only more evidence of your intellectual hubris.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for that too!  What a friendly fellow you've turned out
<br>
to be after all.  As you've no doubt noticed, extropians can
<br>
exude intellectual hubris.   Listen, I don't want to take anything
<br>
away from a genuine genius like Thomas Jefferson, but he *was*
<br>
writing in the eighteenth century, you know.  He and his friends
<br>
had accumulated vast practical experience in self-government in
<br>
the American colonies, and intuitively knew what would and would
<br>
not work.  (Sadly, modern nations are so big that these lessons,
<br>
applicable to any Western, modern nation, tend to be lost.)
<br>
<p>Had he known about Darwin, Dawkins, Popper, Wilder Penfield, etc.,
<br>
and the most *recent* anthropological research, he wouldn't have
<br>
made such egregious generalizations.
<br>
<p>Want to analyze?  Or is this being hubristic?  Here is what
<br>
he wrote again:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is what is called personal liberty, and is given him by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Author of nature, because necessary for his own sustenance.&quot; 
<br>
<p>1. &quot;because necessary for his own sustenance&quot;.  Now Jefferson
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew well the Romans and the Greeks, and saw himself what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was working and not working in Europe and the colonies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what did he know of three thousand years of Egyptian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history, or almost that much of Chinese history?  He would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have refrained from using such a phrase had he known!
<br>
<p>2. The &quot;Author&quot; of nature?  Are you indeed a Believer?  Few
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed have survived the hammer blows of Marx, Darwin, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freud.  Now materialism reigns supreme, and even theists
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avoid such language today.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Under the law of nature, all men are born free, every one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comes into the world with a right to his own person, which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;includes the liberty of moving and using it at his own will.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is patently false that humans are born free or with a
<br>
right to his or her own person.  They are entirely helpless
<br>
and in almost all cases are totally under the control of
<br>
their parents.  Indeed, even as they age, in most cultures
<br>
they observe that the liberties of moving or using their
<br>
own persons are severely curtailed; why, even in our own
<br>
they find they cannot ride motorcycles without taking care
<br>
to place the government's head in a safety helmet.  And
<br>
we're among the best, historically speaking.
