<em>&gt; &gt; This is a UN embargo. A Freudian? (World==America==USA ?)
</em><br>
<p>Well, one can't win this argument.  If one refers to it
<br>
as a UN embargo, then the rejoinder is &quot;Nyah! At the
<br>
behest of the United States!&quot;, whereas if one says &quot;the
<br>
U.S. Embargo&quot;, then it's evidence of self-centeredness.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually I thought that America is the big continent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; composed of South and North America.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rudiger,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        That comment has been made many times by many people that also live on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Continent of America.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is pretty old stuff.  The term &quot;United Statesian&quot; doesn't
<br>
work.  Worse, there are other &quot;United States&quot;, e.g. Mexico.  We all
<br>
in this discussion can't help what the common terms are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        We never deny there are other besides us on this continent.  However 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are the Country of America as we are the only one to my knowledge that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; featured that name in naming our country.  
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, or just the first to do so.  In any case, the U.S. is the
<br>
most prominent of those so doing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        But let me go back in time.  You as a German probably don't have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full grasp how thoroughly your people have penetrated this society nor how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far back in our history that occurred.  For example when we first became a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation and chose a language for ourselves German was the largest single 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethnic group we had.  However they were outnumbered by the English, Irish &amp; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scots (all speaking English) so you lost the decision.
</em><br>
<p>I have read that more Americans list descent from Germans than
<br>
list descent from any other ethnic group.  Which is to say that
<br>
the German immigrants interbred at a very high rate with everyone
<br>
else.  I also have a German acquaintance who is in denial of this
<br>
fact. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        We don't wish to bully you or anyone.  We don't wish to disrupt your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade.  On the other hand we will continue to attack those that have attacked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or threatened to attack us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        We prefer to have your blessings and your assistance.  If not we are a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sovereign nation and we will get the job done on our own.
</em><br>
<p>I shall try to list 20 countries at random.  Russia, Netherlands, Portugal,
<br>
Germany, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Canada, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Trinidad &amp;
<br>
Tobago, Vietnam, Zaire, Malaya, Nicaragua, Libya, Brazil, Central African
<br>
Empire, Bulgaria, Greece.  (Never mind my method---it was pretty flaky and
<br>
did not produce the hoped for randomness.)
<br>
<p>How many of them feel intimidated by the United States?  That is, 
<br>
how many are under pressure from the U.S. to do this or that?  How
<br>
many feel threatened?
<br>
<p>Bullies make one feel threatened, and are intimidating.  I think
<br>
that the situation would be far different if Iraq (a) did not
<br>
contain an administration that within recent memory invaded
<br>
an innocent nearby country, (b) did not use nerve gas on its
<br>
own people as well as an enemy, was not under the reign of a
<br>
cruel and brutal dictator, and had not for many years been
<br>
openly in defiance of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
<br>
<p>(See &quot;Saddam's Bombmaker: The Terrifying Inside Story
<br>
of the Iraqi Nuclear and Biological Weapons Agenda by Khidr Abd
<br>
Al-Abbas Hamzah, Jeff Stein (Collaborator), Khidhir Hamza&quot;, at
<br>
Amazon or elsewhere.)
<br>
<p>So just why would other countries on my list above
<br>
feel threatened?
<br>
<p>Lee
