<p>
To Mike Lorrey,
<br>
<p>Mike I was born in 1959.  And I guess at my age when the Vietnam War
<br>
ended, I was media brainwashed into thinking that after the North
<br>
Vietnam's initial takeover and massacre when we left that there was
<br>
basicly peace in that region.  
<br>
<p>Your clear explanation of the aftermath of us pulling out has completely
<br>
changed my mind about Vietnam.  I still don't think we fought to win, if
<br>
we had I think we could have won.  But I didn't realize that so many
<br>
people who shared our ideals died after we left.
<br>
<p>I haven't voiced in as a hawk or a dove as yet on the war with Iraq.
<br>
But I don't think I want to sit on the fence here anymore.
<br>
<p>I want Sadam Hussein out of there, but I don't want a lot of innocents
<br>
killed either or on our side or theirs!  
<br>
<p>Waiting for him to die is not an option his son publicly murdered a man
<br>
in front of foreign visitors!
<br>
And we hear that he crippled his brother to prevent him from competing
<br>
with him once his father died.
<br>
<p>It is true we have an unfortunate history of backing the wrong people.
<br>
And I know we have had a role in helping more than one dictator get and
<br>
stay in power.  But I like to think once we realize our mistake that we
<br>
undergo the pain to admit it and correct it.
<br>
<p>What would happen if we made Sadam pay personally like we did Kahdafi?
<br>
<p>1. Take out all of the air defense and command &amp; control that we know
<br>
about like we did in the first war.  Any mobile launchers that we've
<br>
identified remove also.
<br>
<p>2. Use ground troops to protect the oil fields from being destroyed for
<br>
the peoples sake.
<br>
<p>3. Then just bomb the presidential palaces with our precision guided
<br>
bombs.  And use one of the 
<br>
Deep penetrating bombs where we know his bomb shelters lie.
<br>
<p>4. Then we just wait...  If that's not enough to kill him, or send him
<br>
into exile, or have him overthrown then we cut off his supply lines and
<br>
play a waiting game.
<br>
<p>5. If a weapon of mass destruction is used by him, we document it for
<br>
the world, and wait some more until a significant number of Coalition
<br>
lives are lost to these weapons.  When this happens the world will see
<br>
that we were right and the level of restraint we have used to this
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>6. I doubt it will get to this point but if it does.  We need to use
<br>
block busters on whereever the
<br>
weapon was fired from and wait again.   If think this will require a
<br>
great amount of restraint but proceeding in this manner while it may
<br>
prolong the war will demonstrate to the world and more importantly to
<br>
ourselves our commitment to minimizing casualties on both sides!
<br>
<p>We are rapidly approaching a point where countries will attempt to
<br>
attain nuclear weapons if for no other reason that to blackmail us into
<br>
getting them to remove them.  We should not have to bear this burden
<br>
alone!  If we give into North Korea's blatent attempt at blackmail, we
<br>
open the door for any third-world country that has put it's military
<br>
needs in front of it's own people's welfare.
<br>
<p>I also really resent what France is doing now.  They are giving Sadam an
<br>
out, a hope that he will once again squirm away.  And they are going to
<br>
force our country to act without world support.  We already have
<br>
everything underway, we can't let all of our troops just hang out over
<br>
there until we bankrupt our country and France knows this.  
<br>
<p>It is very undiplomatic of me to say this but they are a very small
<br>
self-important country.  Historically they have been very important, but
<br>
everyone in America that I know who has visited there comes away shaking
<br>
their head at the rudeness of the people.  If you speak their language
<br>
poorly you held in more contempt than if you don't even try.  Even their
<br>
diplomats have been overheard making antisemetic remarks. They think
<br>
their language is the best, their food the best and they have a hate for
<br>
globalization.  They can't stand it that America is now making wine that
<br>
equals theirs.  They are the second largest producer of weapons besides
<br>
the United States.  I know that they a still a major cultural center in
<br>
Europe and that that people travel there for the museums, the culture
<br>
and the food.  But if this is the way they choose to repay us we need to
<br>
vote with our wallets and stay home, buy American wine, and invest our
<br>
tourist dollars in those countries who stand with us in our time of
<br>
need.   Great Britain I salute you and when I make it to Europe, it will
<br>
be your country where I choose to spend my dollars!
<br>
<p>Samantha, I hope and pray you are wrong about all the lives that will be
<br>
lost.  I too have many misgivings about the leadership of George W.
<br>
Bush.  In this decision I can not fault him though. I also hope when
<br>
this over we and the UN can guide Iraq and Afghanistan to building
<br>
countries where the Moslem people have the most rights and highest
<br>
standard of living in the world.  Their peoples must advance for in the
<br>
end the oil will run out and we will move on the other forms of energy.
<br>
If they are kept in empovrished and uneducated by their governments and
<br>
religious rulers in the end they will be left with sand.
