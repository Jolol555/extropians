<p>
I've had a couple of off list exchanges over the last day
<br>
or so that have in some ways enlightened me and in some
<br>
ways depressed me.
<br>
<p>As some of you know, I sometimes go into &quot;rant mode&quot;, in
<br>
part to get people to sit up and do some self-examination.
<br>
You can label this message semi-rant mode.
<br>
<p>I'm on the board of the Extropy Institute.  I'm one of the
<br>
more frequent contributers to the list (because I have
<br>
more free time than most of the other board members).
<br>
<p>As I've explained to some people off-list recently I'm
<br>
always *forcing* myself to face extropic priorities.
<br>
How can I call myself an &quot;extropian&quot; or consider myself
<br>
to be a responsible board member if I do not do that
<br>
as often as I can look at myself in the mirror?
<br>
<p>So how do I set up my extropic priorities?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging, malnutrition/starvation (perhaps poverty), AIDS, Malaria,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps murderous tyrants, ...
<br>
<p>I take them in a very rigid line of what destroys the most
<br>
concentrated information (e.g. human lives) each year.  (This is
<br>
not guaranteed to be the best approach -- one could take an approach
<br>
that tries to save the greatest number of future lives which might
<br>
result in a much different weighting.)  But it *is* an approach
<br>
that I can look at, put some numbers on and evaluate the
<br>
extropic &quot;return-on-investment&quot; that I may be receiving.
<br>
<p>In my (perfect) world we would be allocating resources
<br>
to defeat these problems on a pro rata basis -- to the
<br>
extent of the problem so should be the resources devoted
<br>
to solving them.  I realize that is an idealistic perspective
<br>
but it forces one to examine &quot;How close does my &quot;personal&quot;
<br>
allocation of resources come to an optimal allocation that
<br>
I would like to see for solving the problems?&quot;.
<br>
<p>I am forced into a conclusion that the ExI mailing list
<br>
is pretty far from that ideal.  In large part because many
<br>
of the conversations do not focus on a couple of key questions.
<br>
(1) Will my making these comments make any real difference?
<br>
(2) Will the comments produce some &quot;activity&quot; that results
<br>
in progress on the &quot;extropic&quot; scale (either the one I've defined
<br>
for myself or your own personal scale)?
<br>
<p>If you do not answer those questions before you hit the reply
<br>
key, then I don't think you can legitimately consider oneself
<br>
an extropian.  You don't have to answer the questions affirmatively
<br>
but one does need to engage in some self-examination as to one is
<br>
adding &quot;signal&quot; to the list or whether one is producing nothing but
<br>
noise.  And then adding &quot;signal&quot; is perhaps not enough -- is that
<br>
signal going to produce concrete changes in reality?  If it doesn't
<br>
produce concrete changes in reality (presumably of an extropic nature)
<br>
then *why* the f*** are you wasting your time posting to this list
<br>
if for any other reason to listen to oneself go mumble mumble mumble?
<br>
<p>The question is &quot;Do you merely want to be right?&quot; or &quot;Do you want
<br>
to see reality (really) change?&quot;.  If you want to see reality (really)
<br>
change it is probably not going to be by debates &amp; postings to the
<br>
extropian list -- it is going to be by getting away from the extropian
<br>
list and discovering avenues that produce real action.
<br>
<p>My 2 cents, semi-rant mode off.
<br>
<p>Robert
