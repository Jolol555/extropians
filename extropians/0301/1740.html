<p>&lt;&lt;The &quot;hydrogen economy&quot; has been promoted for years by environmental 
<br>
activists and alternative-energy gurus like Amory Lovins. But hydrogen is not 
<br>
a source of energy, something which hydrogen advocates either don't 
<br>
understand or refuse to acknowledge. Since hydrogen does not exist in 
<br>
geological reservoirs it must be extracted from fossil-fuel feedstocks or 
<br>
water. The process of extracting hydrogen uses energy, which means that using 
<br>
hydrogen is less efficient that burning fossil fuels. And if you're worried 
<br>
about global warming you certainly don't want to go that route. As a recent 
<br>
energy-technology review in Science magazine pointed out last November, &quot;Per 
<br>
unit of heat generated, more CO2 is produced by making H2 [hydrogen] from 
<br>
fossil fuel than by burning the fossil fuel directly.&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;Honda, for example, is leasing five of its FCX fuel-cell vehicles to the 
<br>
city of Los Angeles. It is clearly a PR ploy since the cost to the company 
<br>
for each car is $1.6 million. Honda has also constructed a bank of solar 
<br>
panels in Torrance, California for the purpose of generating &quot;clean&quot; 
<br>
electricity to produce the hydrogen. But it takes a whole week to generate 
<br>
enough power to produce one tank of hydrogen at a cost of $40,000 per tank. 
<br>
Call me crazy, but that's a long way from affordable transportation.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Moreover, wind farms are incredibly land intensive. Three newly proposed 
<br>
wind farms in West Virginia would occupy 30 to 40 square miles but would 
<br>
produce slightly less electricity than a new 265 MW gas-fired combined-cycle 
<br>
generating plant, which would occupy a few acres. Sallie Baliunas at the 
<br>
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, estimates, using very 
<br>
conservative assumptions, that producing enough hydrogen with wind power to 
<br>
replace just one-third of the vehicles on the road today would require 
<br>
210,000 square miles. In reality, that number would likely be much higher.&gt;&gt;
