Damien,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have asked you a cruel hard question.  But I sit here daily 
<br>
lurking on a site of mostly Arab Moslems and I read what they are thinking.  
<br>
I know they hate the West, including Australia, for the very things most of 
<br>
us would think good about ourselves -- in my estimate that includes you.  You 
<br>
like most people on this list are educated, you are or seem to be secular in 
<br>
your view of the world, you are tolerant in your outlook.  Further, I can 
<br>
read and see the organizations they have committed to propagandizing the 
<br>
West.  I know that any nation that attempts to defeat the US has to accept 
<br>
defeat on the battlefield as given but has long since learned he can defeat 
<br>
us through the &quot;chattering&quot; classes at least upon occasion.  I see frequent 
<br>
discussions on that list of whether or not it is a sin to have sexual 
<br>
intercourse with a captive -- the answer is that such is acceptable for those 
<br>
that did the capturing.  The message is clear.  Most Moslems are good and 
<br>
decent people but there is a large group that is a much rougher and readier 
<br>
crowd and no one dares speak out to any large extent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I listen to you and others as you advocate the US acting the role 
<br>
of a sacrificial lamb.  Even though you have been hit hard yourself you 
<br>
continue to council that we stand quietly while our throats are cut.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to ask why you want this role for us.  I have to question your 
<br>
motives, your assumptions and any underlying reasons I can find.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my questions are painful for you then I am sorry.  However the fate 
<br>
you seem to have planned for us is even worse -- why?
<br>
Ron h.
