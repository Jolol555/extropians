<br>
<em>&gt; That's one of the points I remain unclear about. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I was under the impression that experiments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (either real or gedanken) by Chiao and colleagues 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had shown that even *in principle* slit closure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was enough to block interference. 
</em><br>
<p>[part II]
<br>
<p>We have seen that, according to Von Weizsaecker
<br>
(and, of course, Bohr) complementarity between 
<br>
many kinds of localization and superposition is 
<br>
a general feature of QM.
<br>
<p>Some interest arises, these days, about a new
<br>
interpretation, to be called - I suppose - MTI,
<br>
many times interpretation. Let us have an atom,
<br>
in some excited state. In such case the energy of
<br>
the atom is indeterminate, the atomic state being
<br>
in a linear *superposition* (with appropriate amplitudes)
<br>
of all possible states that can be reached by the
<br>
particular excitation. Now the rate of spontaneous
<br>
emission from the excited atom (better say here: from 
<br>
an ensemble of equally excited atoms) oscillate 
<br>
*in time*. This time-like interference is caused
<br>
by the probability for the emission to occur at
<br>
time t (with emission of a quantum). Actually this 
<br>
probability has an interference term, because we do
<br>
not know from *which*, of all possible atomic states,
<br>
the emission is caused.
<br>
<p>Having here a sort of superposition in time (and not
<br>
in space) the quantum Lotto ... might be useful. (Do
<br>
they patent also these non-senses?)    
<br>
<p>Bohr and Heisenberg had many 'turbulent' discussions 
<br>
about uncertainty relations (Heis. principle). Are they 
<br>
an implementation of the complementarity principle? 
<br>
Now people think they are just that. And, maybe, we
<br>
will see it, later.
<br>
<p>At that time Bohr and Heisenberg were in agreement
<br>
about this, at least. Any attempt at a *well* defined
<br>
subdivision within a quantum phenomenon (i.e. between
<br>
quantum system and apparatus)would require a change 
<br>
in the experimental set-up such that the phenomenon
<br>
disappears. In Heisenberg terms this becomes: the right
<br>
place to find the uncertainty is the micro-macro
<br>
boundary.
<br>
<p>So that (Damien's) 'impression' (that 'even in principle..') 
<br>
was cute, as we'll see in the next post. And was right and 
<br>
wrong at the *same* time. Heh, we are discussing QM, 
<br>
are not we? :-)
<br>
<p>In general the paradoxical (non local-realistic) features 
<br>
of QM, in most interpretations (*), just show how QM is 
<br>
trying to reach, at the very *same* time, maximum of uni-ty 
<br>
and maximum of di-vers-ity. Somebody called that 'uni-verse'.
<br>
Somebody else maybe 'multi-verse'!
<br>
For a new demostration of the above see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/StrangeQM/Hardy.pdf">http://www.oberlin.edu/physics/dstyer/StrangeQM/Hardy.pdf</a>
<br>
and the performed experiment at L. Berkeley Labs:
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908081">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9908081</a>
<br>
<p><p>(*) 
<br>
- In example the Copenhagen-Bohr (complementarity,
<br>
uncertainty, non-commutativity, our language cannot
<br>
reproduce quantum features, the role of the observer, 
<br>
Born rule, etc). Note that, surprisingly enough, Bohr was a 
<br>
'realist', and not a 'positivist'. And not a 'surrealist' 
<br>
like Pauli. Bohr thought that Einstein's realism was too poor.
<br>
- Or the Gottingen-Heisenberg-Born (emphasis on matrix 
<br>
mechanics, on Born rule, and, later, on potentiality).
<br>
- Or the Princeton-Von Neumann-Wigner (Von N. added the operator 
<br>
representation, a model of measurements, the 'collapse' 
<br>
(invented by Heisenberg), and, with Wigner, the 'psycho-
<br>
physical'parallelism, the 'consciousness', Wigner also added 
<br>
many operators, his negative probability 'functions'...).

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101051">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101051</a>
<br>
- Or the MWI-Everett-Wheeler-De Witt.
<br>
- Or the Dirac-Feynman representation (Lagrangians, actions, 
<br>
paths). Note that actually Dirac did not even write the word 
<br>
'wavefunction', never, as far as I know.
<br>
- Etc.
