</em><br>
<p>Thanks Lee. I'm no programmer, webmaster or sysadmin, but I've had
<br>
some experience in managing an IT consulting co including the
<br>
infrastructure aspects. I think that in saying the cost is essentially zero
<br>
you are not including cost of skilled time (such as yours) to set it up.
<br>
And I think we also need to take into account that some skilled time
<br>
(and a *physical presence* is required somewhere - maybe near the
<br>
&nbsp;ExI server? - to ensure backups etc are made) and for ongoing
<br>
maintenance and support at some level. I.e.. There would perhaps
<br>
need to be someone willing to be do some moderating (perhaps like
<br>
Eliezer does with SL4.org). Any volunteers for say a three month trial?
<br>
<p>I don't know how much on-going time would need to be spent by some
<br>
skilled folk(s) to do the maintaining, moderating and similar ongoing tasks.
<br>
But on the principle that *any* extrope with skills could always find
<br>
*something* else extropic to do with &quot;spare&quot; time I think we *should*
<br>
acknowledgement that there is in fact some costs involved in ongoing
<br>
maintenance and support which should be factored.
<br>
<p>Even to do the setup, to take a let's-build-it-and-see-if-they'll-come
<br>
approach for a 3 month trial say, requires some sort of commitment
<br>
from someone (like Lee) to do the setup and to do some maintaining and
<br>
to make that commitment its reasonable that a hurdle level of interest be
<br>
set so that that person(s) time is not wasted.
<br>
<p>I reckon there were about 5 or so extropes who said they were interested
<br>
in an ExI wiki complementary to the ExI list. I don't recall anyone
<br>
opposing.
<br>
How many would be enough for the project to move from a  concept to a
<br>
let's-give-it-a-go-thing? If we can get 10 say would that be enough to
<br>
justify
<br>
a test run for 3 months? What is the level of interest needed Lee? (I just
<br>
had
<br>
&nbsp;a &quot;flashback&quot; to a Bible story where Abraham or Lot was 'negotiating' with
<br>
God to save Sodom and/or Gomorrah if he could only find a few good men
<br>
- but that's irrelevant. Forget I mentioned it :-)
<br>
<p>BTW. Bearing in mind the ExI board or someone on it would need to
<br>
give the project the ok. I noticed in a recent WTA-announce post that
<br>
the ExI Board has had some changes. Natasha is now President and Max
<br>
has stepped aside (presumably to do other things)?  Thanks, best wishes
<br>
and more power to Natasha, Max, the new ExI board and team!
<br>
<p>Can someone on the ExI board advise if there are any logistical or other
<br>
impediments to starting a wiki as a complementary facility to the list if
<br>
we can find sufficient levels of interest on the list and have resources to
<br>
get it setup and maintained for say a three month trial? A nod of 'in
<br>
principle'
<br>
assent (or otherwise) from someone on the ExI board would seem to be
<br>
a prudent next step.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
