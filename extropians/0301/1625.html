<em>&gt;From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20Genetic%20Engineering:%20Bradbury%20trumps%20Burch?">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Subject: Genetic Engineering: Bradbury trumps Burch?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or another subject line might be &quot;Europe demonstrates its stupidity&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The article: &quot;GM cows to please cheese-makers&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/print.jsp?id=ns99993307">http://www.newscientist.com/news/print.jsp?id=ns99993307</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bottom line -- Europe will have to allow its cheese makers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(not a *small* business in Europe) to import and use GM cows
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to produce its cheese (if they do not do this they aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competitive on a cost basis) or ban the import of cheese from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;New Zealand or other countries using such animals (presumably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violating various free-trade agreements).
</em><br>
<p>Since they complained so much about the U.S. upping its taxes on European 
<br>
imports, they wouldn't have much of a case for banning the importation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Interestingly, since cheese is &quot;protein&quot; and not &quot;DNA&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(though I do not know the extent to which cheese might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contain some fraction of DNA), the argument with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the transfer of genetic material, genetic corruption, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becomes *much* reduced with respect to cheese derived from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;GM cows.
</em><br>
<p>This is an important point.  It may very well be the *products&quot; of GM, and 
<br>
not necessarily GM that will win the day.  I don't think the greens really 
<br>
grasp this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is a really *stupid* argument in the first place since both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cows and the bacteria one applies to the milk to produce cheese
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been *highly* bred/selected by humans. They are certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;green&quot; (whatever that means).
</em><br>
<p>They'd still find some pseudo-mythical way to facilitate allowing those and 
<br>
not direct GM.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The only point of this message is to recall how over the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several years Greg and I have had some duels with regard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how significant the &quot;green&quot; movement might be with respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negative impacts on the use of genetically modified organisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have consistently maintained GMO will trump green. I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;offer up the above news item as a case where technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progress is backing green into a smaller and smaller corner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the playing field.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  GM has technological mobility on its side.  Where one approach 
<br>
doesn't work, another (more palatable) way will be found.  The greens are 
<br>
trying to stay put, technologically.  GM tech is agile.  The greens will be 
<br>
outflanked, it's just a matter of time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[I will note as an aside that I strongly support *sustainability*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is a very limited subset of what is generally involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the green/organic mentality.]
</em><br>

&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
