<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I gave no rant.  I told you off for claiming I was just mouthing  empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogans as if I had no real thought (several posts accused 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all who think like I of this) or didn't really have any investment but was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just passing on something I presumably picked up by osmosis.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such as your opinions on Vietnam?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Once again you now bob and weave&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pot calling the kettle black?  You should hardly be one to accuse someone
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; 'bobbing and weaving' considering multilpe people on this list have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly asked you to justify your stance on Vietnam, especially when
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; make clear statement about opposing murderous regimes (such as Hitler) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WWII yet find the same attempt to oppose an even more murderous regime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'senseless' when considering Vietnam.  
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Vietnam is a much less clearcut case.&quot;
<br>
<p>The fact that you believe it was much less a clear cut case seems to
<br>
indicate your lack of knowledge on the subject.  How was it not clear cut?
<br>
A murderous expansionistic regime was attempting to further murder and
<br>
expand.  Ho had already killed some 50,000 of his own people during his
<br>
version of land reforms.  The soviet premiers had announced they would
<br>
support any efforts of nationalization.  I didn't see south Vietnam
<br>
slaughtering 50,000 of its own people and then invading the north.  Those
<br>
were soviet tanks, anti aircraft guns, machine guns and supplies that the
<br>
north were fighting with.  And opposing this is what you considered
<br>
'senseless'?  Well, we opposed it, then abandoned them, and 3 million people
<br>
died as a result.  
<br>
<p>&quot;I have neither the time nor inclination to debate Vietnam when a much more
<br>
pressing and immediate senseless war is staring us in the face.&quot;
<br>
<p>I wonder if the same criteria you used to judge the Vietnam war as senseless
<br>
you are also using to judge this effort as 'senseless'  
<br>
<p>&quot;That is not &quot;bobbing and weaving&quot;. It is recognizing priorities and
<br>
meaningless tactics that it is pointless to spend precious time playing to.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sounds like bobbing and weaving to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also asked you multiple times what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you felt of the Korean war, and to compare and contrast it with the
</em><br>
Vietnam
<br>
<em>&gt; war.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I am not interest in such a discussion.  So what?&quot;
<br>
<p>Because there were very few practical differences between the Korean war and
<br>
the Vietnam war, except one we won, and the other we abandoned, and
<br>
subsequently 3 million people were murdered.  Yet one you consider
<br>
'senseless', is that just because we lost it?  And the other you don't know
<br>
enough on it to comment, apparently.  Thats why I wonder if you also
<br>
consider the Korean war 'senseless' since we won that one, yet more
<br>
civilians and combatants were killed, and more of them were draftees as well
<br>
(In WWII, some 50% in the army were drafted, in the Vietnam war it was 33%,
<br>
with the rest volunteers, the Korean war number of draftees was somewhere in
<br>
the middle of those two figures) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since I made a valient attempt to not come off as making personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks or present my case in a condescending tone, I can only conclude
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; you can not present the justification for your opinions on these matters
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; thus choose to ignore them entirely.  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It is not worth my time or yours.&quot;
<br>
<p>Its not worth your time to justify your own opinions?  Well, as they say,
<br>
everyone has a right to an opinion, but not every opinion is right.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps a small seed of doubt has
<br>
<em>&gt; been planted in the back of your mind that those anti-war protests you
</em><br>
took
<br>
<em>&gt; part in actually contributed to the mass murder of millions of Indochinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  Perhaps you find this so disturbing that this is why you ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these comments and inquiries.  Or perhaps I have allready made it into
</em><br>
your
<br>
<em>&gt; 'kill file'  Got to silence those dissenting opinions eh?  Or maybe im
</em><br>
just
<br>
<em>&gt; a promoter of 'anti-communist propoganda'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Nope, not a single seed of doubt that that war was morally reprehensible
<br>
from the beginning.  Sorry.&quot;
<br>
<p>As Max said, it sure was, so place the blame on the communist murderous
<br>
regime that started it, and ended up slaughtering 3 million people, not the
<br>
democratic nation that tried to stop it at the request of the nation being
<br>
invaded.  Your opposition to it was it morally reprehensible by every
<br>
standard of logic and reason.  Perhaps *that* is why you wont discuss it.  I
<br>
would imagine it is difficult to realize and accept you were complacent in
<br>
the murder of millions.  Its tough, but some have, such as David Horowitz,
<br>
and Todd Gitland (former president of the SDS) Who laments that he regrets
<br>
that he did not notice early enough or do enough to stop the take over of
<br>
the anti-vietnam war protests by communist supporters and sympathizers.
<br>
Gitland is also appaled that the recent ANSWER colation protest (was that
<br>
the one you attended?) is run by these same people.  You talk of the
<br>
immorality of supporting murderous regimes, the people who founded ANSWER
<br>
are proudly in support of Ayatollah Khomeini, Kim Jong Il, Slobodan
<br>
Milosevic and Saddam Hussein.  Name ANYONE in this group that stands for ANY
<br>
extropic values of any kind.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I am done with your massive intellectual dishonesty&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intellectual dishonesty?  I am still waiting to hear if you feel the
</em><br>
korean
<br>
<em>&gt; war was also 'senseless' and if it wasn't, why was it not senseless yet
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; vietnam war was?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I am no expert on the Korean War.  Do I have to analyze every single war to
<br>
your satisfaction to point out the absurdity of this one?&quot;
<br>
<p>No, but you should at least analyze 'this one' (the vietnam war) before
<br>
claiming it is absurd.  You may have, but your perceptions of it are clearly
<br>
biased to an anti-american stance, considering that the US withdrawel lead
<br>
to so many murders, yet you consider our efforts there 'senseless'.  The
<br>
protests you took part in (I believe you said you had) against the vietname
<br>
war by the anti-war movement were put on by communist sympathizers who
<br>
supported murderous corrupt regimes (see Gitlands Interview).  Just as the
<br>
Anti War protests of today are.  The fact that you either don't know this or
<br>
willingly ignore it is testament to your lack of objective knowledge on the
<br>
subject, especially considering that as an extropian it is reaonsable for me
<br>
to believe you would oppose all such murderous tyrannies and efforts to stop
<br>
them.  Considering this, clearly your opinion that vietnam was 'senseless'
<br>
can only be rationally explained by assuming that you were not aware that
<br>
these regimes were that murderous, or that corrupt, or that 3 million people
<br>
were killed as a result of our abandonment of south east asia.  It seems you
<br>
are under the impression that everything that was wrong there was because we
<br>
were there, and once we left, everything was A'OK.  Before we got there,
<br>
50,000 were killed, after we left, 3 million were.  You should examine the
<br>
Korean war if you are to hold any opinions on the vietnam war, because they
<br>
are so similar.  
<br>
