Brett,
<br>
<p>I have enjoyed this exchange very much.  My responses are below in parentheses.  I would hope other people on the list would throw in their opinions on these matters.

<p>G'day John,
<br>
<p>(Howdy from Arizona!)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So we should be doers of the meme and not hearers only? : )
</em><br>
<p>Well, memes as I understand them are particular ideas that are
<br>
able to be communicated, so we wouldn't actually *do* them so
<br>
much, as promote or propagate what we think are good ones.
<br>
<p>(Ahh..., but aren't those the particular ideas which motivate our actions?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't you realize just how fun esoteric discussions can be? 
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I sure do : )  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; lol  Actually, we have had some good threads on pragmatic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches to &quot;propagate the memes&quot; but as has been said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  before, leading extropians is sort of like herding cats.      
</em><br>
<p>A good line : )
<br>
<p>(I wish I knew who originally came up with it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you continue:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My interest, (perhaps call?) to politics, or &quot;social politics&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you prefer is a call to relevant pragmatic action *in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world* to achieve our objects knowing we will be confronted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all along the way with the &quot;you should not play God&quot; charge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as though we actually have a choice on that matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (end)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So..., you wish us to engage wholeheartedly in grassroots 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social activism? : )
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't have put it quite like that, but maybe. I'm not really
<br>
sure what *you* have in mind by &quot;grassroots social activism&quot;.
<br>
<p>(I envision local extropian/transhumanist/cryonics groups gathering on a regular basis and getting involved in their communities by a combination of mass media involvement (if they have the talents and to an extent the credentials), sponsoring lectures and seminars(on a very basic level), and when necessary going out and picketing &amp; raising a little hell to counter outspoken luddites who are usually the only squeaky wheels around when news cameras are around.  They would be at least nominally guided/advised by Max More, Natasha Vita-More, Greg Burch, Harvey Newstrom and other wise ExI officers/members who could help them to do well and not have things blow up in their face.) 
<br>
<p>(VOLUNTEERING (I'm sure they could find worthy projects) to be seen as a force for good (and also actually BE a force for good) by the people around them would also be a huge boon to us.  How about &quot;eductional toys for tots&quot; sponsored by your cities local Extropian chapter?  The possibilities could be endless here.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It is a method those on the &quot;other side&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have used for years and done very, very well with. 
</em><br>
<p>I recently went through Natasha's presentation on Pro-Act.
<br>
Have you seen it? The reason I ask is that I'm wondering if
<br>
by 'those on the &quot;other side&quot;, you are referring to the same
<br>
organisations as Natasha identified in the presentation?
<br>
<p>(I was there when she gave it at Extro-5.  Perhaps instead of saying &quot;other side&quot; I should have said &quot;the dark side as lead by Jeremy rifkin who some see as the spider in the center of the web.&quot; lol  I look forward to seeing Natasha get better and have the time and resources to move forward with Pro-Act.)  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;grassroots social activists&quot; often have very professional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations and personalities guiding them along.  
</em><br>
<p>I guess they could. But I imagine they might be a bit of a mix.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me we have had an elite of extropian leaders who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the personalities, intellect, education, reputation, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charm necessary  to get interviewed in the mass media, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage in public debates and publish articles in widely read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or at least influential publications. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes there are lots of very capable people associated with ExI.
<br>
<p>(It's time to better harness them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Max and Natasha come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mind along with a few others, but I just wonder if their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence alone is really enough?
</em><br>
<p>Well, as you've said, they are not alone, and it seems to me
<br>
that both Max and Natasha are pretty knowledgeable about
<br>
practical ways of building an organisation and increasing the
<br>
reach of their positive influence. I don't know that they have
<br>
managed to &quot;herd cats&quot; as such but some impressive &quot;cats&quot;
<br>
are still coming voluntarily to this particular waterhole.
<br>
<p>(As Max and Natasha know, extropian &quot;cool cats&quot; must be encouraged and will just not be forced(as with real cats!) to do what they don't want to.  I would simply like to see the extropian/transhumanist rank and file membership do much more and not just the more prominent members.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I view their efforts as a very good thing, but perhaps in time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the &quot;rank and file&quot; of ExI can start doing much more.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  move toward encouraging extropians to form local groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in their area was hopefully a step in that direction.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a positive initiative. Just recently the WTA set
<br>
up a mailing list in Oz, but it seems to be struggling so far 
<br>
because the content is quite similar to what you'd get on
<br>
larger international lists and the numbers interested are 
<br>
proportionally smaller for Australian and New Zealand.
<br>
Seems like most folk have given up on it. Still a few good
<br>
esoteric conversations have started and continue ;-).
<br>
<p>(If you happen to have Damien Broderick on it you are doing pretty dang good!)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I remember when Mike Lorrey (perhaps to an extent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivated by frustration) tried to found his own organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually go out and do something in the local community. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But his idea of putting pro-GM food labels on fruit may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been going too far.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, overcoming fears about GM foods is tough, but this is 
<br>
exactly the sort of issue that I think is important for ExI to take
<br>
on at some stage because it is the same sort of fear about
<br>
biotechnology, largely coming from a lack or real understanding
<br>
that is likely to pop up again and again as extropians try and
<br>
encourage not just the development of new life enhancing 
<br>
technologies but the legal environment in which they will be
<br>
permitted to use them. 
<br>
<p>My real concern about politics is in this area John. I retain a 
<br>
healthy scepticism towards such issues as AI, molecular
<br>
nanotechnology, the singularity, cryonics and so on (I say try
<br>
because my natural inclination is to want good things to be
<br>
true but they won't happen if indeed they can happen unless
<br>
people make them happen). Now I am pretty confident that
<br>
the calibre of the folks I have seen on this list means that 
<br>
some excellent brains are not just messing about in these
<br>
spaces but are pushing forward on solutions. But my own
<br>
area of deepest experience (not expertise by any means) is
<br>
probably more in the biotech area specifically in stem 
<br>
cells. And what I have seen in the last couple of years or
<br>
really even since Dolly the clone was reported back in
<br>
November 1998 is a lot of political obstacles to potentially
<br>
life saving technologies going up, mainly due to ignorance
<br>
and fear. I am concerned that although we may have the
<br>
technological wherewithal to achieve radical life extension
<br>
and a number of other good things in our lives we may be
<br>
prevented from making the technological progress that
<br>
is possible due to political and sociological factors. In short
<br>
the very democracies in which we live may veto the things
<br>
we wish to do because a majority of voters will fear the 
<br>
change and vote against it. Its because of my experience
<br>
as a stem cell lobbyist and my concern that the political 
<br>
log jams may be so hard to push through in the timeframes
<br>
we'd like that I'm particularly interested in the practicalities of
<br>
forging change. Its in this sense of wanting to forge change
<br>
that I am thinking politically.
<br>
<p>I understand Penicillin essentially sat on the shelf for something
<br>
like 20 years before it was actually mass produced and made
<br>
available to the general population, It took a war to get
<br>
it out of the lab and onto the market. Technology does not
<br>
always necessarily go quickly from discovery or development
<br>
to market, and I am concerned that sometimes people may 
<br>
assume it does a little more easily than it does. 
<br>
<p>(These are very thought-provoking comments, though nothing which is really new to me.  As a stem-cell lobbyist do you see broad and effective coalitions being formed to promote the wise use of the technology and counter opposition?  And if so is it being funded and lead properly?)
<br>
<p>(One reason cryonics attracts me is that it's the ultimate safety net should the war against aging not succeed fast enough for me(or wind up setback for decades).  I had a cryonicist scientist friend tell me it will be at least fifty years till we are even close to biological immortality.  Of course this is his personal opinion, but it I don't want to be eighty (I'm thirty-five now) and too old to be helped while twenty year-olds have a no sweat attitude.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In an &quot;ideal world&quot; ExI would have a billionaire patron who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would lavish a $200 million dollar endowment upon it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve its goals.
</em><br>
<p>To be honest John I find it as hard to visualise that scenario
<br>
as if you had asked me to picture a square with three sides.
<br>
<p>(Men like Saul Kent, Will Falloon and David Pizer have &quot;made their own luck&quot; in terms of going out and actually becoming wealthy in large part with the goal of advancing cryonics and those things associated with it.  I only wish Don Laughlin (about half-way to being a billionaire) would consider funding cryonics research and other initiatives, but he chooses not to.)
<br>
<p>My sense of things is that billionaire patrons don't get to 
<br>
be billionaire patrons and have $200 million dollars to endow
<br>
unless they are very very good at identifying exactly what 
<br>
the particular goals are and at seeing or demanding to be
<br>
shown exactly *how* the endowment would be spent to
<br>
achieve those very particular goals.
<br>
<p>(And for this very reason I could see Bill Gates or Larry Ellison choosing to start their own quasi-transhumanist organizations with agenda's custom tailored rather than going with ExI or someone similar.  As age takes its toll on them and they continue to see biotech not advance as much as they would want, they may consider doing something big to turn the tide.)
<br>
<p>I guess I'm saying get the goals right, get the game plan 
<br>
right and the money can be found. Getting the goals and
<br>
the game plan right is very very hard though imo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But since something like that has so far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not happened, we must (and they have) get by with what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  funds and volunteers there are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yet many grassroots organizations have made huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strides and accomplished goals on very limited resources, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so this is no real excuse for us.  We must get creative and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become &quot;good guerilla fighters!&quot; lol  Certainly the books 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and training materials to do this are out there.
</em><br>
<p>I think our ideas, and our ability to convey our ideas to a wider
<br>
community will be important. Of course its very hard to 
<br>
convey ideas that suck, so the ideas really have to be good.
<br>
<p>(Anders Sandberg, Max More, Eliezer Yudkowsky and others have eloquently discussed this matter in past threads.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If among extropy listmembers we had the will to act equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the level of intellect here there would be no problem.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course one or two really wrong steps in the public eye 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could do possibly incalculable damage.  What will be done?    
</em><br>
<p>I've proposed a simple beginning. I've proposed we start by
<br>
tidying up some of the language and terminology we use so
<br>
that are thoughts are clearer and so that when we engage with
<br>
people and groups who oppose our aims we can do so more
<br>
effectively. 
<br>
<p>(Natasha Vita-More I believe did create a press kit to at least help somewhat in this area.  I don't know to what extent it fleshes out the subject.)
<br>
<p>I've proposed that extropians give up using the terms &quot;belief&quot;,
<br>
&quot;human life&quot; and &quot;human being&quot;. My reasons for this are
<br>
covered in other posts. 
<br>
<p>BTW. I do understand that you are both an extropian and
<br>
a Christian. That makes you somewhat unique in my experience,
<br>
I hope you don't take personal offence at anything I may say
<br>
that is critical of religion or belief or faith. It will definitely 
<br>
not be intended as a personal criticism. I grew up in a Catholic
<br>
family and my parents are still practising. We disagree on
<br>
some things but the arguments (especially) with my mum
<br>
are always interesting and in good faith.
<br>
<p>(If I took personal offence to what people said around here regarding religion I would have left ages ago! lol  I suppose I have a foot each in two very different worlds, but that in some ways can be a good thing.  I thank you for clarifying your desire to not offend me and I appreciate it.  My own mother is a devout Mormon who is actually pretty supportive of my cryonics interests.  Ironically my agnostic/atheist younger brother is the naysayer about it(he sees it as macabre and against nature).)    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel fortunate to be in my own way trying to do something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In time the Creekside Preserve Lodge where I work will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branch out into the Ventureville cryonics community which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be a haven for both old and young cryonicists. 
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a great idea. I wonder if this community will be
<br>
one of many. In a way I hope not, I hope most of us will
<br>
be able to avoid &quot;the second worst thing that can happen
<br>
to us&quot;. 
<br>
<p>(Thank you for the praise.  I would like to think other cryonics communities will be developed over time, but aside from the Timeship I just don't know.)
<br>
<p>(It would be nice if most of us could avoid &quot;the second worst thing&quot; but I would not any chances! lol  Robert Bradbury is convinced those who stay healthy in my age bracket and lower will make it across the &quot;finish line&quot; and I deeply hope he's right  He is someone whose opinions on such matters I greatly respect due to his scientific/business background.)    
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the headquarters for The Society for Venturism which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will along with protecting cryonicist's rights, also share with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world a message about the benefits of trying to attain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical immortality.  And with the funds we make at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Creekside we can empower our goal of doing this.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing I am certain of is that we will need each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to see the kind of world we ultimately want. 
</em><br>
<p>That's a cert.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take people like Max More, Natasha Vita-More, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Pizer (former Alcor V.P., founder of the Venturists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and owner of the Creekside) to lead the way.        
</em><br>
<p>Well that will definitely be a plus. But maybe we can still
<br>
manage some serious progress forward if we have to carry
<br>
a few wounded. 
<br>
<p>(I can only hope so (and try to do something, too)!!)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; best wishes,
</em><br>
<p>Likewise John, nice to meet you.
<br>
<p>(Perhaps sometime we will meet at an Extro or Alcor conference if you are the traveling sort of Australian.  And if that is so, you will have to stay at The Creekside Preserve Lodge if you are ever in the area for whatever reason.)
