<p>This is a silly piece of polemics.
<br>
<p>| The first was re-election last year, snatched from the jaws of
<br>
| defeat by his last-minute embrace of anti-American pacifism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<br>
This badly conflates two different sentiments.  Are the same people
<br>
who oppose war pacifists when (e.g.) Chechnya is concerned, but
<br>
anti-Americans when Iraq is concerned?
<br>
<p>Just what exact factors produced the election outcome if far from
<br>
clear.  The pundits pointed to the flood, among other things.  The
<br>
whole Iraq issue is completely overrated as far as Germany is
<br>
concerned, anyway.  The German military has no means to project
<br>
force at the distance required.  German troops cannot meaningfully
<br>
participate in a campaign against Iraq, no matter whether this is
<br>
desirable or not.  And German approval or disapproval of military
<br>
action against Iraq is about as relevant as that of Liechtenstein.
<br>
<p>| That energized the Green Party and empowered Germany's new
<br>
| isolationism.
<br>
<p>The Green party profited from the singular popularity of Joschka
<br>
Fischer, the German foreign secretary, who consistently shows up
<br>
as the most popular politician in German opinion polls.
<br>
<p>What isolationism?
<br>
<p>| In its wake came the second Schröder triumph, his recent spinaround
<br>
| of Jacques Chirac of France.
<br>
<p>No.  The French are always very wary of American policy and have
<br>
been extremely restrained on the whole Iraq issue, not committing
<br>
to anything.  As far as I can tell, there has been no change in
<br>
French policy at all.  The coy girl has been saying &quot;maybe&quot; all
<br>
along, which seems to have been construed as &quot;yes&quot; before, as &quot;no&quot;
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>Also, while currently much is made in this part of the world of the
<br>
newly found agreement between France and Germany on all kinds of
<br>
issues, the individual statements don't sound all that similar at
<br>
all.  We're deep in the field of diplomacy here, admittedly an area
<br>
where the current US administration (with the exception of Colin
<br>
Powell) appears to be singularly lacking, with Rumsfeld only yesterday
<br>
behaving again like a drunk rhino plowing through a china store.
<br>
<p>| In a stunning power play in Brussels, Germany and France moved to
<br>
| change the practice of having a rotating presidency of the European
<br>
| Council, which now gives smaller nations influence, to a system
<br>
| with a long-term president. This Franco-German czar of the European
<br>
| Union would dominate a toothless president of the European
<br>
| Commission, chosen by the European Parliament.
<br>
<p>I didn't follow this too closely, but neither did this happen over
<br>
night, nor is it clear just what effect on E.U. politics this will
<br>
ultimately have.  For years, French-German agreement have been the
<br>
engine that powered the advancement of the E.U., much to the chagrin
<br>
of the USA, I guess, for whom an eternally divided and infighting
<br>
Europe would be preferable.
<br>
<p>I consider it highly unlikely that France will veto miliary action
<br>
against Iraq in the Security Council, nor do I believe that Germany
<br>
will eventually cast a (meaningless) nay.  Look to Russia and China
<br>
for trouble.
<br>
<p>| Schröder's third victory is less complicated. The image-obsessed
<br>
| politician is extraordinarily sensitive to personal criticism.
<br>
<p>Yes, that seems indeed to be the case, providing for ongoing
<br>
amusement.
<br>
<p>| What this final victory shows is that Schröder [...] does not
<br>
| share the free-speech values of the West.
<br>
<p>Careful, careful.  In Europe in general, &quot;free speech&quot; faces certain
<br>
limitations that prohibit hate speech and personal libal/insult/etc.
<br>
Schröder's court cases refer to the latter, where allegations were
<br>
made regarding the _person_ of Mr. Schröder, not the Chancellor.
<br>
Or so the courts found.  The remarkable thing is that Schröder
<br>
insisted on resorting to legal means (which is entirely in his
<br>
right), instead of just ignoring and shrugging off this irrelevant
<br>
gossip like most people in the limelight do.
<br>
<p>| The German design is apparently to saw off the Atlantic part of
<br>
| the Atlantic Alliance, separating Britain and the U.S. from a
<br>
| federal Europe dominated by Germany and France
<br>
<p>Well, as one commentator remarked yesterday in response to Rumsfeld's
<br>
ill-advised ramblings:  It is clear now that the USA seeks vassals,
<br>
not allies.
<br>
<p>If there even is such a thing as a &quot;German design&quot;, it is to position
<br>
Europe as an independent world player rather than a puppet of the
<br>
USA to slavishly follow each and every American command.  And that
<br>
goes down well with the French.  That Great Britain prefers to side
<br>
up with its former colonies rather than the continent is somewhat
<br>
vexing.
<br>
<p>| reminds populous and powerful nations like India and Japan of the
<br>
| inequity of mid-sized France having the veto power
<br>
<p>Veto power in the Security Council is bestowed on those with the
<br>
ability to project force.  India is strictly a local power, Japan
<br>
only an economic one.
<br>
<p>| The chancellor's Pyrrhic victories are part of the backdrop to
<br>
| the existential crisis that the Security Council is bringing on
<br>
| itself.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, in this part of the world the USA is perceived as
<br>
the one demolishing the credibility of the Security Council.
