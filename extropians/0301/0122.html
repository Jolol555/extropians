</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subjective---------F---------Objective (con - pro)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where F is a hypothetical fulcrum/balance between the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a democratically determined objective... i.e. (&quot;these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fucking defective clones are costing us a fortune to treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or repair&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>Good suggestion and analysis, but most people I respect
<br>
(E. O. Wilson being an exception) recognize the is/ought
<br>
barrier, and that values must remain subjective.
<br>
<p>Preferences are values, and so I don't see how objectivity
<br>
can be introduced.  Even if &quot;these clones are costing us
<br>
a fortune&quot;, just as &quot;these Alzheimer patients are costing
<br>
us a fortune&quot;, some would argue---based on their values---
<br>
that it is fitting and right that society foot the bill for
<br>
such costs.  How can anything be objectively undesirable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have to say I'm with Shermer in saying - let's run the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Damn right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On another track, I seriously think some cryonics organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Alcor?) ought to consider the costs vs. benefits of publicly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; announcing that clone Eve shall receive a gratis suspension if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things should go tragically wrong, or she reaches an age where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide becomes a conceptual and desirable option.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, I hope that you're wrong and that they have not over-estimated
<br>
the public.  I cannot see how anyone could possibly object to
<br>
trying to save a defective clone so that it could maybe be
<br>
repaired later, but then I am on this list, where a lot of us
<br>
cannot see how people can be so [deleted].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And wouldn't that cause an ethical firestorm if a clone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should one day *demand* the right to an assisted &quot;suicide&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to obtain a very high quality suspension.
</em><br>
<p>Fine.  Perhaps the more ethical firestorms we get
<br>
right now, the sooner people will abandon their
<br>
outmoded worldviews.
