<p><em>&gt; The question I would ask Max and others is &quot;When does one act?&quot;.

<p><p>When we, or our allies, are in clear and present danger. Or when we have 
<br>
the moral obligation to do so.
<br>
<p>The only long-term solution there is to threats like terrorism, are 
<br>
those we have applied to the Soviet Union. Time and &quot;economic warfare&quot;.
<br>
<p>We won over the soviet union by a mix of stick and carrot. We are 
<br>
currently winning over China! A potential much bigger threat than Iraq. 
<br>
This just go basically unnoticed because we are doing it slowly by peace 
<br>
and trade.
<br>
<p>They are all moving in the direction of a free (market) society. When 
<br>
they show us a little movement in the direction of human rights and 
<br>
freedom, we open the trade and cooperation a bit. Until they finally 
<br>
have an open and free society.
<br>
<p>The problem right now is that we in the west needs the oil from the 
<br>
middle east. This means that we cannot do what is morally right.
<br>
<p>We simply cannot tell the arab dictators to &quot;get democracy, human rights 
<br>
and freedom, or we will isolate you!&quot; So we, albeit unvillingly, support 
<br>
dictatorships.
<br>
<p>Here we are on the moral low ground. This is the main problem with the 
<br>
current situation. We are hypocrites. All of us in the west, not just 
<br>
the US.
<br>
<p>The only real alternative I see if we could make ourself independent of 
<br>
the middle east oil. Perhaps by developing a hydrogen economy?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How much of Northern Iraq should we let the Islamic fundamentalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take from the Kurds?  Do we allow them to create another Afghanistan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we stand by while violence takes 100+ lives in Nigeria?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about 1 million+ lives in Rwanda?
</em><br>
<p><p>It is limited both by our moral obligations, and by how much we are 
<br>
actually able to do. This is no easy call. But there should be a clear 
<br>
and consistent policy in these situations. This is missing right now.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't think we (the U.S., Europe, etc.) apply our interventionist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies in very consistent ways.  I can think of Yugoslavia, East
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Timor and Afghanistan as cases where we intervened with some success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it was only after a lot of human suffering had taken place.
</em><br>
<p><p>Agreed! We have a moral obligation to help. But then again we don't have 
<br>
the obligation to solve every problem in the world. I actually think 
<br>
that we are doing it just right right now in the EU. Adding more and 
<br>
more countries to out peacefull circle of influence.
<br>
<p>In time they will be strong and rich allies. If we can then gradually 
<br>
expand this circle, soon the world could become a peacefull place.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Sticking our heads in the sand doesn't solve the problems because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are intolerant and/or power hungry people out there who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *will* take advantage of that situation (Hitler, Stalin, Milosevic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Khomeini, Osama, Saddam, etc.).  The real question is how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervene in ways that don't create bigger problems down the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; road (as many cold war activities may have done).
</em><br>
<p><p>It is a balance between our moral obligations toward other people and 
<br>
towards our own citizens. We don't have an endless suply of soldiers to 
<br>
waste in conflicts. We should not send troops to a conflict we do not 
<br>
expect to &quot;win&quot;. Both long and short term.
<br>
<p>A problem with Iraq is what to do after the war? Should the west really 
<br>
become an occupational force in a muslim country? We would probably not 
<br>
win many friends in the region that way.
<br>
<p>They are pretty upset over the israeli occupation of palestinian 
<br>
territories as it is. Which we by the way are not doing much against. 
<br>
Even though the UN has demed it illegal.
<br>
<p>We cannot just leave Iraq after having destroyed the power structure . 
<br>
That would open it up to all kind af dangerous possibilities. So it is 
<br>
far from certain that we can &quot;win&quot; the conflict.
