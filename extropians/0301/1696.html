Seems like an obvious question to me.  North Korea and Iraq can't destroy 
<br>
the world.  The US can.  North Korea and Iraq have the potential to hurt a 
<br>
lot of people, maybe even millions if a nuke is used, but they can't blow 
<br>
up the world, nor destabilize diplomatic relations and international law 
<br>
all by themselves.  Only the US can do that.  Even if it's the US doing it 
<br>
because of a response to North Korea and Iraq, it's still the US doing it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If North Korea and Iraq are threats to world peace chiefly because of 
<br>
the response their actions could provoke from the US, then the US would 
<br>
seem to be the larger threat to world peace.  I suppose you could argue 
<br>
that North Korea and Iraq would be more to blame, but that doesn't make 
<br>
them larger threats.  North Korea and Iraq, by themselves, can at most 
<br>
destroy a city; they cannot disrupt world peace without the cooperation of 
<br>
other countries in being disrupted.  China, the US, and the FSU are the 
<br>
chief threats to world peace.  North Korea and Iraq aren't in the running.
