Hi Carlos!  I was hoping that you'd see this and address it.

<em>&gt; Subject: Re: Don't cry for me, Argentina
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In 1900, Argentina was the 6th wealthiest country in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What happened?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Practically every single thing that could go wrong or done badly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did and was so starting from the 1920s or around, I guess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My personal...opinion:  as the country modernized, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power naturally tended to diffuse downwards from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aristocratic classes thatruled since independence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the country failed miserably at was in properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrating the new power actors each time they appeared.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this, both the previous dominant actors and the newly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrived at that moment, are equally guilty...
</em><br>
<p>Okay, when I read the URLS I'll be trying out this
<br>
interpretation.  Thanks for the mini-essay, the book
<br>
suggestion, and the URL.
<br>
<p>---Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everybody showed a remarkable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to carry on their power contests disregarding laws,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; republican institutions, idea debate, and economic competition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The way things have been solved since then has been by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coups, dictatorships, fraud, forced economic redistribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (up to down, down to up, sideways, you name it), censorship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the gleeful application of violence in all its lovely ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And so here we are today, and still managing to get worse by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the week.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Does anyone know of a book that chronicles all the bad moves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;made by that nation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this one was pretty good, though admittedly it's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many years since I read it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0271021926/">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0271021926/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As an Argentine myself, I tend to read more essays, opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces and news analysis than books that try to make sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the utter mess our history has been. The Economist has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known, IMHO, to get regular articles on the past years about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our country, and usually pretty good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The latest mistake was apparently taking the peso off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;dollar, which instantly cheated thousands of deep pockets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;out of 3/4 their wealth.  And, more importantly, sent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;message that capital that wished to survive had better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;flee the country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not quite so. The mistake wasn't actually in doing that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in how and when. Once more, the people who ended up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charge of things after the shit hit the fan didn't address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of the problems, but proceeded to another of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lovely forced economic redistributions to keep things tied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up just enough for the country not to blow up. I recommend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you this paper, which addresses several myths, such as the &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chaos was caused only by removing the peso currency peg&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I heard also that the government had agreed to pick up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the bill for any cosmetic surgery desired by a citizen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is starting to sound like a case where the usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;damage inflicted on an economy by socialist tendencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;turned out to be too much, and killed it off.  In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;words, the government spent itself to death.  And had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to start printing pesos?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Menem administration wasted all the money and structural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes they managed to achieve during their first years when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they decided to go for reelection. The welfare spending that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensued to catch the lower classes' vote, plus the cozy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kleptocracy/oligarchy dealings showered on many higher classes'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power actors to ensure their support did away both with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money and with the structural changes. What resulted was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bloated, perverted version of a welfare state administered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by political bosses that ensured the votes for the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the sweet deals for the government's bussinessmen friends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The De La Rua administration completely failed to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things and was devoured by the lower classes that now lacked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their easy welfare, and those of the upper classes that now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lacked their sweet deals and extended kleptocracy. The Duhalde
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration, as I mentioned before, did a huge redistribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make sure the boat wouldn't catch fire before sinking, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then just sat on their asses yelling for the IMF to come stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sinking, all the while seeing how -their- particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bussiness friends, political bosses and segments of the lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes could be put in charge of things after the rescue. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be seen, this week if I recall right (last chance to a final
</em><br>
<em>&gt; default being averted with their specific loans), if the IMF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will bite. Bunch of morons as they are, looks like they might...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I'll try to address any comments next week when I'm back, but no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promises... Sorry! Blame work and all that.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
