<p>
The recent talk of war against oppression reminds me that there is a need
<br>
for U.S. citizens to be aware of possible dangers at home.
<br>
<p>NPR's  radio program THIS AMERICAN LIFE for January 10th was titled &quot;Secret
<br>
Government&quot; and included an interview with Jose Padilla's lawyer, Donna
<br>
Newman. Ms. Newman was informed that she was no longer Mr. Padilla's lawyer,
<br>
because Mr. Padilla had been classified as an &quot;unlawful enemy combatant&quot; and
<br>
moved to a military prison where he was being held indefinitely, despite the
<br>
fact that he had not been charged with any crime.
<br>
<p>On behalf of her non-client, Ms. Newman filed a Petition for a Writ of
<br>
Habeas Corpus. You can read the Response and Motion to Dismiss filed by
<br>
George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and John Ashcroft here:
<br>
<a href="http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/padillabush82702grsp.pdf">http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/padillabush82702grsp.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>One's first thought might be that there's no harm in George Bush having the
<br>
power to throw someone into prison without a trial, a lawyer, or even formal
<br>
charges. After all, as George Bush has stated, &quot;[Jose Patilla] is a bad
<br>
guy.&quot; In fact, it appears that Jose Padilla probably *would* satisfy most
<br>
people's definition of a &quot;bad guy.&quot; What bothers me, though, is that the
<br>
definition of &quot;bad guy&quot; has a way of changing over time.
<br>
<p>Lest anyone accuse me of being a commie pinko because I listen to NPR, the
<br>
Cato Institute published the following with respect to the U.S. executive
<br>
branch's disregard of the U.S. Constitution:
