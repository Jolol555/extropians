<em>&gt; &gt; it can take a lifetime of careful and fair dealing to earn a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person the sort of good reputation that enables their name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to act as a brand and for  them to get serious things done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My reputation is valuable to me, the higher it is the greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the value, 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; my reputation is valuable to other people too but only if it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate.
</em><br>
<p>Some people such as your family and friends may also benefit 
<br>
from you having an excessively good reputation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's possible that my good reputation is too high and undeserved,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  if I'm given control of it you can bet it will be.
</em><br>
<p>Control is a question of degree. We do have some control of our
<br>
reputations. But I'm not too concerned that there is anyone around
<br>
with full control as yet. Defending anything, including one's, reputation
<br>
takes resources. I reserve the right to deploy my resources as I see fit.
<br>
I like free speech AND defamation laws. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately &quot;they&quot; includes both ones customers and ones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; competitors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then fight back, if I say nasty things about you then say nasty things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about me,
</em><br>
<p>Why should I only fight an inefficient way? Free speech can sometimes
<br>
be cheap speech.
<br>
<p>There have always been plenty of people willing to say nasty things
<br>
about each other and fortunately some of one's forebears saw fit to
<br>
invent a sort of flyswat which one can use to save energy. This means 
<br>
that despite understanding the principle of tit-for-tat, one doesn't need
<br>
to personally punch every nose, return every shot or refute every bit 
<br>
of pissant nastiness. By leveraging knowledge of the law one can 
<br>
delegate. And in delegating one gets the benefit of spending more of
<br>
one's time working on the stuff one wants to work on and less time 
<br>
personally chasing away pests.
<br>
<p>Perhaps &quot;the jungle&quot; hasn't gone its just changed shape, affording those
<br>
who recognize that that is so, a wider range of effective and efficient
<br>
responses than those that don't. Or maybe not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; pretty soon people will learn to disregard what competitors say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about each other, if they haven't already.
</em><br>
<p>They haven't already. Some people start out a bit naive and 
<br>
innocent. Kids seem like that. And the young and capable get sick
<br>
or old sometimes. Should a person without a tounge to speak have
<br>
no defence? Should a stutterer surrender every field to every fluent
<br>
fool? Why are lawyers called 'mouthpieces&quot; sometimes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt; Yeah the laws an ass. But what's the alternative?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Encryption, black markets and anonymity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I liked the way your answered that ;-)
<br>
<p>But I should have said the law's *sometimes* an ass. Fortunately 
<br>
for me, I was born into a world progressive enough to have *some* 
<br>
laws already in place. Maybe in future we'll get by with fewer laws
<br>
and in the mean time I know some folks will break some of the ones
<br>
we have. So be it. A fence that acts as a filter can still serve some 
<br>
use as a fence.
<br>
<p>Law's are just another part of the contemporary environment. Let's 
<br>
factor them, assess them, use them and maybe change them, just like
<br>
any other part of the environment. 
<br>
<p>Stone age encryption looks like a barren sort of exercise. All later
<br>
sorts of encryption seem to presuppose societies requiring laws. 
<br>
<p>I'm pretty sure 'John Clarke' could be traced back to a real person ;-)
<br>
<p>You've not felt the need to hide. I suspect you share my confidence
<br>
that the law is something that you can use (or rely upon) to protect
<br>
yourself more efficiently than having to build an army of your own
<br>
or having to stay small and inconsequentially enough to pass 
<br>
beneath the attention of every bandits and opportunistic parasite.
