<p>
Without discussing any particular inflammatory topic, 
<br>
(please), it does seem a pity that on a list such as this 
<br>
we can't find *some* way to discuss an issue on its merits
<br>
rather than getting all hot n bothered and emotional.
<br>
<p>Sure emotions are part of being human. Sure people can
<br>
get impassioned about defending their views. But there 
<br>
seems to be something inherently tragic (and, I wonder but
<br>
don't know, if its a bit defeatist or just realistic), about the 
<br>
conclusion that we have to actually stop talking about the 
<br>
very topics that inflame our passions. These are, it seems,
<br>
likely to be amongst the very topics that matter most. 
<br>
<p>Are we really convinced that there are *no* ways to curb
<br>
the harmful side of human passions in a group like this?
<br>
Is it really beyond us to set up perhaps corralled areas on 
<br>
the list where perhaps more than the usual courtesy and
<br>
deference to each others views is voluntarily accepted - 
<br>
sort of like a mutual agreement to leave the egos and 
<br>
passions however valid - at the door, or at least to 
<br>
restrain them in the case of particular threads?
<br>
<p>Perhaps it is impossible. Perhaps certain things cannot
<br>
be meaningfully discussed on a list such as this even 
<br>
amongst people who ostensibly have much in common.
<br>
Perhaps even the commonality is less real than imagined.
<br>
<p>It certainly seems a pity that the &quot;better angels&quot; of our 
<br>
nature are so defeated by &quot;our demons&quot;. I hope we haven't
<br>
accepted a gloomy conclusion prematurely.
<br>
