<p>No. As I memory researcher I have to put down my foot here :-)
<br>
<p>The introns are mostly composed to my knowledge of transposable
<br>
elements, little more than devolved viruses or the equivalent of
<br>
&quot;copy me!&quot; signs.  There is no evidence I know of for any
<br>
information being transcribed from them (beside the transponase)
<br>
in the brain.
<br>
<p>While memory does have an interaction with DNA, it is through the
<br>
cascade neural activity -&gt; protein phosphorylation -&gt;
<br>
activation/deactivation of genetic switches -&gt; protein synthesis
<br>
-&gt; changes in the neuron. Very complex and interesting, but no
<br>
place for the idle DNA. 
<br>
<p>Instincts are very interesting firmwired sets of reactions (like
<br>
the common insect and snake phobias of primates or sexual arousal
<br>
when viewing appropriate secondary and primary sexual organs) that
<br>
somehow link rather complex perceptions to various drives. Beats
<br>
me how it is done, but there is definitely a genetic factor here. 
<br>
But it seems rather unlikely this has anything to do with silent 
<br>
DNA, rather with the active DNA. 
<br>
<p>Besides, apparently birds have little or no introns, but they 
<br>
still exhibit plenty of insticts. 
<br>
<p><p>People once thought that memory was stored in DNA or RNA, and it
<br>
was a popular theory. The famous experiments with flatworms whose
<br>
memories seemed to be transferrable through eating appeared to
<br>
support this view. But they were flawed, and today the consensus
<br>
is that memory is stored in synaptic states, as ion and second
<br>
messenger concentrations (the shortest forms), protein
<br>
phosporylation states, protein concentrations and structural
<br>
changes. 
<br>
<p>There is some debate on how active memory (what I'm thinking about
<br>
*right now*) is stored. A popular idea is reverberatory activity
<br>
within network of connected neurons. This may be augmented by very
<br>
fast synaptic changes (see an upcoming paper by A. Sandberg on 
<br>
this issue :-), but the evidence is still hazy. 
<br>
<p>To sum up, there is probably no Elder Eddas within our silent DNA. 
<br>
I find it rather comforting. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Nature never wastes resources.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it does. Nature wastes a lot of resources when not wasting
<br>
them would be more wasteful. We do not absorb all the nutrients of
<br>
our food, we have a lot more neurons than we actually require for
<br>
function, most animal young get eaten or killed and plenty of
<br>
resources are wasted by birds in mating displays. In the first
<br>
example a less wastegul digestion would likely not be worth it
<br>
evolutionarily, since the extra energy and nutrient requirements
<br>
of a better gut would make the resulting organism less fit than
<br>
one with a worse but simpler gut. In the second example a less
<br>
redundant brain would be more vulnerable to damage; the optimal
<br>
amount of redundancy depends on the level of brain damage danger
<br>
in the environment, and that is estimated very roughly through
<br>
fitness. And so on. Nature is abundant and wastes a lot, because
<br>
it only deals with local maxima of fitness, fitness estimates are
<br>
very noisy and the environment changes in a complex fashion,
<br>
moving the maxima around. A nature that never wasted resources 
<br>
would never bother with vertebrates. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Bacteria that have high resistances to heat, radiation would make  good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extracorporeal data archives.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder if they really would. The length of a typical bacterial
<br>
genome is around 1.8 million base pairs (H. influenzae), which 
<br>
means one could get in around a megabit or so per strain. The 
<br>
human genome is a few billion base pairs, so here we could 
<br>
probably hide a few gigabits. But that is still less than is 
<br>
stored right now on my hard drive, and far less than the tape 
<br>
archive in the institute cellar.
