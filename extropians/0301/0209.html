</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; truth that defects can and will occur despite our best efforts. Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only that, but more importantly. The clones that are not perfect or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; far from it are still worthy of life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once they are born, yes. The point is not that, however. The point is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our current actions will result in a highly probable outcome: normal or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defective. Given our current knowledge, there is a clear choice between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these two alternatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of years and even when offspring are genetically fine, there can still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be other problems. That is why it is inevitable that some clones will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be born with defects. Substitute 'defect' for illness/pathology, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if that helps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Little disagreement there. Let's look at the numbers. Given healthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents, we have to compare with normal birth. Given sterile parents, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to look at IVF defect rate (loosely defined, including spontaneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aborts) for comparison. If we were to discuss something resulting in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual policy we would have to gather enough data to compute probabilities 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with sufficiently small error ranges.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is something I hope is being done.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I think the dataset on the side of the clones is a little too small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for a valid argument. I would say without hesitation that if had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not quite, if you factor in the low success rate. Otherwise I agree: wen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need statistically significant chimp data before we touch people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Right. I think the race to the finish line has caused the runners to skip 
<br>
part of the course. I haven't seen any results of primate cloning 
<br>
experiments. It seems to have gone straight from bovine to human cloning.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural problems of reproduction from the argument. It just helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; highlight my previous point that defects can and will occur even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the actual cloning procedure is perfect. My statement says that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes,. Depending on motivation for cloning (because clearly there has to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a point for it if we're looking at vanilla couples) the risks have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outweigh the benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. I had assumed for sake of my arguments that cloning would mainly be 
<br>
used in cases where other methods of reproduction were not available. That in 
<br>
mind, the risk of not reproducing outweigh the risk of reproducing a 
<br>
potentially defective clone. I had in mind cases such as parents that have 
<br>
done the whole infertility and adoption route without success. Where they 
<br>
then adopt disabled children from abroad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; left me on a ventilator, entirely dependent on others for survival. My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would still be worth living. Likewise if I were born  with a similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know. I can't tell it in advance. You'll notice that a number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people terminate their lives for no externally visible reasons. So clearly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a choice to make, and no one can make the choice but the person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; condition my life in my view would still be worth living. Arguments of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Identity aside, there would still be a conscious chain of though that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are no relevant identity arguments I'm aware of. The matters are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really simple. The time of the decision is past already. You can only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply feedback to the parties who made the decision according to your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective evaluation of said decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; exist. There would also be a Hope of improvement. If I had never existed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once you're there, the point is moot. But we're talking about the event 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting in you, and the decisions associated with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there would never be a conciseness or any hope of improvement. So as you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see, I set the line pretty damn low, I imagine that you may not. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not really. You just lump two separate issues together, wheras I treat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them separately. This results in a different evaluation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I can understand that. On separating them, I am not so certain of my 
<br>
evaluation although I do tend toward my original view. This is admittedly 
<br>
biased by my current view of survival at virtually any cost.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;        In any case, a clone would have no more right to Sue than any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; living today that has been born with deformities or ailments. If it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shown 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, the clone would have more rights to sue because there is no damn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason why people should clone people. Unless explained, cloning looks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a frivolous decision with the clone being the one winding up with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill for it. Doesn't look quite right, does it?
</em><br>
<p><p>Again my assumption for the case of cloning was that no alternative was 
<br>
available. So I would agree with the above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Please elaborate. Strawman is not something I am familiar with. If its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a gibe at my response to the comedic scaremongouring that some idiots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have raised against cloning. Then Yes I know I shouldn't lower the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level of the thread to include such inane arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a description of a type of argument where you ascribe to your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponent obviously ludicrous beliefs she does not hold, and then tear them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down with a flourish, then claiming victory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Guilty &lt;G&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why would there be artificially produced defects? If you mean, defects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resultant from the process then that is one thing. Defects that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artificially would point to something different and more sinister. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. You can decide to clone or not to clone. The decision to clone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting in defects whereas decision to not to clone resulting in no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defects clearly shows that cloning defects are artificial. They need not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be there. We put them there deliberately. Because we made a bad judgement, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or because we're actively evil.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm, not sure I agree with that. To clone or not to clone, that is the 
<br>
question. We also have the choice to reproduce naturally which could also 
<br>
yield negative results. If you are saying that the defect only occurred 
<br>
because of the artificial method of reproduction, then yes the defect is 
<br>
artificial in nature, but only as a result of the process itself. I cant 
<br>
agree that we put them there deliberately unless the actual defect itself was 
<br>
intended as in the actively evil case. I think the defect resultant of bad 
<br>
judgement, that being the choice to create the clone. Is more akin to two 
<br>
parents choosing to reproduce when they are both known carriers of a genetic 
<br>
defect. If the risk of defect is known and the chance is still taken, I can't 
<br>
see the undesired defect being considered as artificially or deliberately 
<br>
created. It is however damn irresponsible.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        My suggestion to replace clone with Twin was purely as a response 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the ridiculous arguments or fears such as Armies of clones. It was mearly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meant to remove the unknown irrational fear element that the word Clone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; connotes and replace it with something of virtually equal meaning that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; laypeople are familiar with. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The substitution would have been valid, except cloning is a deliberate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process resulting in defects, whereas natural twins are the low-defect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of a natural process largely outside of our control, currently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Doing what on purpose? When I say Twin I am of course referring to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genetically identical twin resultant of a division of the ovum into two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genetically identical people. This Twin is greatly different in creation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cloning of a living person. however the result is the same. Two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genetically identical people. The clone is for argument sake, just a twin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. They are not genetically identical. You can tell them apart due to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their gene activity pattern. You can very easily tell them apart, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has visible defects, and the original is healthy. It's a bad xerox of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a twin, not a real twin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; a living person that was created and born at a later time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        I wouldn't go as far as to say that a clone of a twin is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triplet, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I may say that it is a twin of a twin. Could this not be considered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correct? The point being that a Clone and a twin only differ in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creation. The result is the same. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. The result is NOT the same. See above.
</em><br>
<p>My bad. As I said, my use of the word twin was for emphasis in my Strawman 
<br>
routine and was an aside to the defect discussion. I am not aware that the 
<br>
process of cloning changes the genetic material from that of the original. I 
<br>
would agree that even if the genetic code itself were identical, there would 
<br>
be differences between the genetic material used to create the clone and the 
<br>
material used to create the original. For one, the telomeres would be shorter 
<br>
in the clones material. I would hazard a guess that this type of difference 
<br>
would cause different gene activity patterns possibly because the clones 
<br>
material is the same chronological age as the original, whereas the clones 
<br>
body is new. If the original was aged 30 when the material was taken and they 
<br>
went on to develop a genetically triggered ailment at 60. I would expect the 
<br>
clone to develop the same ailment at roughly the age of 30. This may or may 
<br>
not be the case. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        The only exception to this I can see is where mitochondria are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into the equation. It could be that a Clone could have different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Mitochondrial DNA to the person that was the original. Even in this case, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; essence of what makes the clone identical to the original e. g the genes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be identical as in a twin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do not look at mitochondria. Look at the sick clone and the healthy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterpart.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        Again, why would the clone be defective? What have civil rights of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The clone will be defective because the current process sucks. As you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, different medical procedures result in vastly different outcomes. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very important to get it right. If you do it wrong, the results can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disastrous, and typically are. Apparently tiny things gone wrong in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure result in life and death, or worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed
