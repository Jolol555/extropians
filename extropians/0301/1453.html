You assumed too much intent in my statement.  I wasn't
<br>
actually pretending as if there weren't cases where
<br>
athiests behave as such, just curious on how difficult
<br>
it is to find documentation.  I wanted to eliminate a
<br>
slew of posts on communism, because of the threads a
<br>
month or so ago, making me assume it would do no
<br>
benefit to the list to open an opportunity for people
<br>
to flame communism, then capatalism back and forth for
<br>
a few more weeks.  The major religions unquestionably
<br>
all have atrocities that were committed for their
<br>
beliefs and their beliefs alone.  It sounds as if you
<br>
suggest they might have done this in China, but as my
<br>
knowledge (which is admittedly weak on the subject)
<br>
stands, it was far more complex.  I also would say it
<br>
doesn't quite parallel if the religious communities
<br>
were documentably causing strife in the 'workers
<br>
paradise' so that their reasons for purging them in
<br>
the name of communism would atleast be logical (not
<br>
defending them or claiming that this was in fact the
<br>
case).
<br>
<p>To clarify the intent in my question I've actually
<br>
noticed a rising number, in america, of hostile
<br>
athiests, as it has spread heavily into the
<br>
disenfranchised youth.  I'm utterly amazed that no one
<br>
has gone out yet and burnt a church or mosque down in
<br>
the name of athiesm and thought maybe it was just my
<br>
naivete that I've not found these cases yet.  
<br>
<p>Also take note, I'm not defending &quot;my group&quot; as I
<br>
don't consider myself an atheist.
<br>
<p>Now a question for you.  You have said repeatedly of
<br>
the dangers of the islam in the war threads, no?  And
<br>
suggested it justifies bombing them as long as the end
<br>
brings less intolerance.  So, wouldn't this be killing
<br>
in the name of &lt;insert whatever religion or lack of
<br>
you support&gt; to the same extent as those who saw
<br>
religion as a direct threat to their communo-paradise.
<br>
&nbsp;How would this be distinct from what the communists
<br>
supported?  Or perhaps, is it different?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering intolerance of the source of persecution

</em><br>
<em>&gt; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who opinions are such as revoking freedoms in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of nothing other than dogma or their culture. &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, you are phrasing your question, in a fashion to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate the Soviets, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Maoists, the Khmer Rouge, The North Vietnamese,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the North Koreans, and so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth, from consideration. Bad Show!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The barbarities and oppression practiced by such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimes was stated as part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and parcel to eliminate superstitions that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holding the workers of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world back; and antithetical to socialism. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone defending the Church against charges that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they promoted the tortures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and murders of Torquemada might ask: Can you supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any link to historical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documents that might suggest that the Fathers of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Church specifically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordered the execution of innocents?   The catch is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody in the Church would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that the victims were innocent. That is-nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the time would've :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atheism was and is part and parcel of the mentality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the People's Republic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of China, today; and the primary reason they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacked and arrested that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silly (whatever is its name) cult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are contending that Atheists are incapable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing evil, it reminds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me of the verbiage I get from Christians, when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opine, during discussions; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about certain atrocities done in Jesus' name. I get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the spiel: Oh, those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weren't really Christians!&quot; I sometimes reply, &quot;Well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who were they then, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Martians, Eskimo's?&quot;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think one has to accept the evil one's groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior that has been done, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once it has been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its like a bad marriage, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one either stays in it for the good it may offer, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one gets out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please don't say: &quot;oh those weren't really atheists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who committed murders 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the banner of Communism, those were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialist.&quot; Or they were from Mars, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mayhaps? :^)
