<p>&lt;&lt;High-Flying Instruments 
<br>
Livermore’s sensors and cameras—as well as the instrumentation of other 
<br>
organizations—fly in a retrofitted business jet known as a high-altitude 
<br>
observatory (HALO). HALO flies at an altitude of about 14 kilometers, high 
<br>
above the weather. At least one Lawrence Livermore scientist is onboard each 
<br>
flight and must take Air Force high-altitude training before flying.
<br>
The HALO takes off from Reagan Test Range about 1 hour prior to the launch of 
<br>
the target missile from Vandenberg. Once in the air, HALO remains within 650 
<br>
to 900 kilometers of the interceptor missile, also launched from Reagan Test 
<br>
Range, until the intercept occurs. A tracking mirror onboard the jet is 
<br>
guided by ground-based radar and tracks the trajectory of the interceptor 
<br>
missile.
<br>
The jet’s high altitude not only keeps it above the weather but also provides 
<br>
for increased atmospheric transmission of infrared light. Many onboard 
<br>
sensors, including several of Livermore’s, collect data in the infrared 
<br>
wavelengths. The ROCSS telescopes collect light through a window specially 
<br>
designed to transmit infrared light and channel it to the instruments via 
<br>
fiber-optic lines...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This article also dovetails with a recent post of mine concerning 
<br>
environmentally safer rocket fuel, which is discussed in the above article, 
<br>
on rocket fuel impact for kinetic kill vehicles. 
<br>
<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;NASA TESTS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY ROCKET FUEL
<br>
<p><a href="http://amesnews.arc.nasa.gov/releases/2003/03_04AR.html">http://amesnews.arc.nasa.gov/releases/2003/03_04AR.html</a>
<br>
<p>NASA has successfully tested an alternative rocket fuel that may increase 
<br>
operational safety and reduce costs over current solid fuels. The new 
<br>
paraffin-based fuel could eventually be used in Space Shuttle booster 
<br>
rockets.
<br>
<p>Two years of collaboration between Stanford University, Palo Alto, Calif., 
<br>
and NASA's Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., have led to the 
<br>
development of a non-toxic, easily handled fuel made from a substance similar 
<br>
to what is used in common candles. The by-products of combustion of the new 
<br>
fuel are carbon dioxide and water; unlike conventional rocket fuel that 
<br>
produces aluminum oxide and acidic gasses, such as hydrogen chloride. &gt;&gt;
