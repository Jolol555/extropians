<em>&gt;&gt;Samantha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       I personally don't think your &quot;feelings&quot; are anything for us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; base 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;national policy on.  In the first place I can't take your feelings out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;your head to even check that you are reporting them accurately.  So I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;them as just another rant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I gave no rant.  I told you off for claiming I was just mouthing  empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogans as if I had no real thought (several posts accused 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all who think like I of this) or didn't really have any investment but was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just passing on something I presumably picked up by osmosis.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such as your opinions on Vietnam?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Once again you now bob and weave&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pot calling the kettle black?  You should hardly be one to accuse someone of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'bobbing and weaving' considering multilpe people on this list have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly asked you to justify your stance on Vietnam, especially when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make clear statement about opposing murderous regimes (such as Hitler) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WWII yet find the same attempt to oppose an even more murderous regime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'senseless' when considering Vietnam.  
</em><br>
<p><p>Vietnam is a much less clearcut case.  I have neither the time 
<br>
nor inclination to debate Vietnam when a much more pressing and 
<br>
immediate senseless war is staring us in the face.  That is not 
<br>
&quot;bobbing and weaving&quot;. It is recognizing priorities and 
<br>
meaningless tactics that it is pointless to spend precious time 
<br>
playing to.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; I also asked you multiple times what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you felt of the Korean war, and to compare and contrast it with the Vietnam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war.
</em><br>
<p>I am not interest in such a discussion.  So what?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since I made a valient attempt to not come off as making personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks or present my case in a condescending tone, I can only conclude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can not present the justification for your opinions on these matters and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus choose to ignore them entirely.  
</em><br>
<p>It is not worth my time or yours.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps a small seed of doubt has
<br>
<em>&gt; been planted in the back of your mind that those anti-war protests you took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part in actually contributed to the mass murder of millions of Indochinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  Perhaps you find this so disturbing that this is why you ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these comments and inquiries.  Or perhaps I have allready made it into your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'kill file'  Got to silence those dissenting opinions eh?  Or maybe im just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a promoter of 'anti-communist propoganda'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Nope, not a single seed of doubt that that war was morally 
<br>
reprehensible from the beginning.  Sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I am done with your massive intellectual dishonesty&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intellectual dishonesty?  I am still waiting to hear if you feel the korean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war was also 'senseless' and if it wasn't, why was it not senseless yet the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vietnam war was?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am no expert on the Korean War.  Do I have to analyze every 
<br>
single war to your satisfaction to point out the absurdity of 
<br>
this one?  No, I don't think so.  And I don't believe asking me 
<br>
to play such a game instead of dealing directly with the 
<br>
arguments is a sign of an honest and to the point discussion.
