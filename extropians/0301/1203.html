<p>I think I understand where you're coming from. And I agree,
<br>
given that position I imagine for you, that your Rejoinder.
<br>
Makes. Sense. Though. It. Stops. Conversation.
<br>
<p>But as for calling that bulleted item a &quot;Reason&quot;--that's
<br>
your label, I think.
<br>
<p>I'd call it a prediction--it was framed as if-then,
<br>
expressing _consequences_.
<br>
<p>One could claim that that's just a rhetorical device, given
<br>
his concluding remarks. But claims are not proof.
<br>
<p>If you want to criticize it as a prediction, I think your best
<br>
shot would be a belly laugh at the notion that the USA has any
<br>
credibility on the global stage...
<br>
<p>Except that it *does* have at least a little. Some.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure the analysis by my friend is 100% correct,
<br>
and it certainly isn't unassailable. &quot;Entirely diminished&quot;
<br>
isn't exactly the phrase I'd have used. But I think the
<br>
strongest logical (non-dialog-killing) response for someone
<br>
like whom I imagine you to be, would be something more like:
<br>
<p>&quot;So what? Who gives a fig for the USA (or Bush, or whomever)
<br>
losing face?&quot;
<br>
<p>At that point, we can discuss the matter further.
