<p><em>&gt; Why is the term leftist more common than its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterpart &quot;rightist&quot;?  Or is it?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps I just missed it, but it seems I hear leftist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guerrillas and leftist insurgency, but seldom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rightist anything.
</em><br>
<p>No, you didn't miss it.  There are several reasons
<br>
for this curious phenomenon, an oddity which impedes
<br>
one's writing occasionally.
<br>
<p>The biggest reason is be historical: quite a number
<br>
of &quot;left-wing&quot; forces gladly described themselves as
<br>
leftist.  Few &quot;right-wing&quot; groups ever employ &quot;rightist&quot;
<br>
(as I don't know why, I lack a complete answer to your
<br>
question).
<br>
<p>Where one might say &quot;rightist&quot;, many writers---whose
<br>
sympathies are often admittedly with the left---choose
<br>
the term &quot;right-wing&quot; instead.  The suffix &quot;-wing&quot;
<br>
always sounds disparaging, but even us conservative/
<br>
libertarians are likely to use it for want of a better
<br>
term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rightists have taken power in the US.  What are they called?
</em><br>
<p>Until recently, most people would have called Bush a
<br>
moderate.  That's what his father was, and it was hard
<br>
to call him conservative.  However, about half of his
<br>
stances now seem conservative, and the other half moderate.
<br>
<p>To say that &quot;rightists&quot; have taken power is to allude
<br>
to a &quot;Seven Days in May&quot; type scenario, where right-wing
<br>
generals *take over*.  So it's false IMO that &quot;Rightists
<br>
have taken power in the US&quot;.
<br>
<p>The present administration should be called conservative/
<br>
moderate.
<br>
<p>Lee
