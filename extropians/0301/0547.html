<p>Yes, but reentry plasma is a harsh mistress. You'd ablate, too, if it 
<br>
happened to you.
<br>
<p>Usually, things are a bit cooler.

<p>Yes, a diamond is one single macromolecule. In fact I've got a little

thingy about really tiny diamonds here for you to read:

<p>They don't have to be big, and they don't have to be perfect. Here they 
<br>
dwell comfortably within 3d-crosslinked polymer country.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The original question had to do with Santa Machining a Lamborghini engine.
</em><br>
<p>Lamborghinis and ICUs in general are an anachronism in context of
<br>
santamachining. You could make them, eventually, but no one in her sane
<br>
mind would.
<br>
<p>Right now we're talking about polymer circuits, I thought. And thin-film 
<br>
cells, and displays, and stuff. Maybe some actuators, even.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ablative materials are probably not the best choice for IC cylinder parts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or for close tolerance turbines. So that whole angle is a strawman in context,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I fear.
</em><br>
<p>So don't use ablative materials. But no one will be needing ICUs nor
<br>
turbines, so the point is moot, nyanya.

<p>Not next week. Next couple decades, maybe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Santa-lathes and -potter's wheels are not out of the question, of course.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slurries of nanocrystals were, however, mentioned in my reply, and I count both

<p>I meand semiconductor nanoparticle suspension in polymer ink, to boost

<p>Loose buckys will autoignite when blitzed with a photophash.

<p><em>&gt; That's OK, most of the fools out there accessorizing their cars with carbon fiber

</em><br>
<p>Graphite/epoxy doesn't do too badly on impact, if designed for impacts 
<br>
(Formula 1). It doesn't burn very well, and by the time it ignites you're 
<br>
burned already to cinders by the hydrocarbon conflagration which managed 
<br>
to ignite the graphite honeycomb chassis.
