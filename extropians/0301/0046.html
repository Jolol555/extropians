<em>&gt; Samantha,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Look at what is being said.  &quot;I served my country as a security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence reconnaissance expert for black agencies that don't
</em><br>
officially
<br>
<em>&gt; exist.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Now that says that congress didn't approve of the &quot;black agency&quot;
</em><br>
nor
<br>
<em>&gt; did they authorize money to be spent on it.  They do not know of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existance and cannot exercise their constitutional duty of oversight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        So where do they find their authorization.  The President or
</em><br>
someone
<br>
<em>&gt; in the government has privately decided they need men of this type to to
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; jobs that an honest member of the FBI or other legitimate government
</em><br>
employee
<br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't do because it is illegal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Where did the money to pay these &quot;Off the books operatives&quot; come
</em><br>
from.
<br>
<em>&gt;  It is either money that was discretionary or that was redirected from
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; other legitimate source.  Possibly the President or whoever collected the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money from private sources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        In the end we have private operatives, being paid unauthorized
</em><br>
money
<br>
<em>&gt; to perform services that are illegal.
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt;From what I have read, the US military does have a &quot;black box budget&quot;
</em><br>
included
<br>
in its funding requests to Congress.  That portion is said to pay for top
<br>
secret
<br>
research programs.  The Stealth Bomber was apparently in this budget at one
<br>
time.  Some Congressmen DO get security clearance to know about these
<br>
projects such as those on a Congressional Defense Committee but not all of
<br>
the
<br>
535 Congressmen get this access.  Thus, the vast majority of the Congressmen
<br>
must have &quot;faith in&quot; the Committee that reveiws the budget before it goes to
<br>
the
<br>
House and Senate floor for a vote.  I do have some misgiving about this
<br>
process but I also feel certain that some Congressmen would leak classified
<br>
information that would benefit the enemies of the US.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Doesn't this sound a bit like Nixon's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; men known as the plumbers or the &quot;private detectives&quot; that Clinton sent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with difficult women?  We do know the standing of such men from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observing recent history.  when their identity is found out and their
</em><br>
deeds
<br>
<em>&gt; proven they often go to the penitentary.
</em><br>

Yes, it does sound &quot;a bit&quot; like Nixon and Clinton's goons.  Though I am
attracted to working for the Defense Department in IT, the secrecy and
near extraterritoriality of the US military within the US does give me
tremendous
pause.  I think I'll either do IT as an educator or private sector
mployee.  - Bill.
