<p>
Lee Corbin sets up a test as follows:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Brett Paatsch claims that the two extended statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A.  &quot;I believe that life begins at conception.  I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     that any other points we might choose are essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     arbitrary and uncertain.  And I believe that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a view founded not in religion, not in faith, but on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the logic of the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B.  &quot;My working hypothesis is that human existence begins
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     at conception, and I contend that this is a view founded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     not in religion, not in faith, but on logic.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not equivalent.  I claim that they *are* equivalent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who is correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks (whichever way you respond),
</em><br>
<p>Good idea to put the proposition to a test in this way
<br>
Lee. Your quite right, we should be able to determine
<br>
empirically whether extropians as a whole perceive 
<br>
a difference between A and B. 
<br>
<p>As Eliezer pointed out, B, as set up, is missing a sentence
<br>
(or A has an extra one), so that confounds the test a little.
<br>
Also its possible that by putting names on the options
<br>
there might be subtle &quot;allegiance effects&quot; that have little
<br>
to do with the question being tested. I hope not, but its
<br>
not impossible, so I'd have preferred the propositions
<br>
not potentially confound a choice involving support or
<br>
opposition of either one of our views. Its possible that some
<br>
people would not want to &quot;dump on&quot; the less favored 
<br>
proposition in deference to whoever happened to be
<br>
holding it and so may not &quot;vote&quot; or express an opinion.
<br>
<p>I'm sure both you and I would not mind (well not much :-)
<br>
but not everyone would know that we have such healthy
<br>
ego ;-) and some might be &quot;gentle&quot; on us. 
<br>
<p>Its also very possible many couldn't care less :-) Which 
<br>
would be a pity, because if my thesis is correct this is 
<br>
something that can be acted on to some good extropic
<br>
effect with negligible additional effort or cost. 
<br>
<p>I would argue that *if* a difference is perceived and more
<br>
people see the variant without belief as more open to
<br>
further discussion then I've made much but not all of the
<br>
case I need to make to get some extropes to voluntarily 
<br>
give up reinforcing the believing meme (which competes 
<br>
head to head with the more sociable reasoning meme) by
<br>
using it. 
<br>
<p>I'd have liked to have heard what more people thought, 
<br>
that's why I've waited to respond. Perhaps this sort of test
<br>
could be set up on a web page somewhere so we can get 
<br>
empirical evidence with larger response rates on perceptions
<br>
of words (i.e., memes) that we are using in social political 
<br>
discourse.
<br>
<p>Lots of other word memes and phrases could then be tested
<br>
(on different groups of people) including &quot;human life&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;human beings&quot; and we'd have a useful empirical tool easily 
<br>
adapted. Alas I don't have the specific tech know-how to 
<br>
put this on a web page quickly, but I'm sure others would.
<br>
<p>I'd have been particularly interested to hear what John
<br>
(Pelagius) Clarke, John Grigg, and Anders to name just
<br>
a handful thought.  
<br>
<p>I reckon I know which way Max More would vote :-)
<br>
But I could be wrong.
<br>
<p>Rather than just leave this hanging as a tribute to gas 
<br>
expenditure and idle typing why not push forward with it?
<br>
<p>I would propose removing the word belief from the
<br>
Extropian Principles and replace the word where
<br>
it occurs with an alternative. Any thoughts?
<br>
