<p>Certainly not -- thoughts in general (creative or otherwise) have to be
<br>
based on personal experience, so they cannot be &quot;random&quot;.  Just as it
<br>
is easy for Natasha to have &quot;creative&quot; artistic thoughts compared with
<br>
me (her experience dwarfs mine in that area), it may be harder for her
<br>
to have &quot;creative&quot; thoughts about programming because in that area her
<br>
experience (I think) is somewhat less than mine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so than memes are just random occurances?
</em><br>
<p>To some extent -- but they are still largely based on personal experience.
<br>
I'd highly urge readng the books from my personal reading list (maybe also on
<br>
the Extropian Reading List) by William Calvin (<a href="http://www.williamcalvin.com">http://www.williamcalvin.com</a>) --
<br>
he does a really good job explaining one possible physical representation for
<br>
&quot;thoughts&quot; and how creativity might develop from that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming that all humans have creative ability and are creative is there a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible measurment of creativity?
</em><br>
<p>Its one of those &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; observations.  History is filled
<br>
with people who were recognized (sometimes after the fact) as being very
<br>
creative.  It seems it would be hard to develop a measure of &quot;creativity&quot; that
<br>
could be applied in everything from sculpture to economics to physics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems that certain people have more ability to connect seperate thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together? Isn't this what we assume intelligence is?
</em><br>
<p>Not really -- &quot;intelligence&quot; (at least IMO) seems to involve the number of
<br>
thoughts you can juggle simultaneously, some rate of retreival aspects and
<br>
the ability to chain or group together things in logical patterns.  It seems
<br>
to be &quot;volume&quot; and &quot;speed&quot; (i.e. bandwidth) related.
<br>
<p>Creativity on the other hand seems to be a &quot;recognition&quot; capability.  It
<br>
leans on intelligence -- since the more things you can look at or group
<br>
together per unit time, the more likely you are to discover something
<br>
interesting -- but there is a crucial aspect of intermixing several
<br>
thoughts and then the perception that that intermix has some novel and/or
<br>
useful properties.  Two people could have the same creative thought and
<br>
one could recognize it as useful and run with it while the other could
<br>
not perceive it as useful and discard it.  I think creativity may be
<br>
quite context sensitive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I got a little ahead of myself there, thanks for the input, nate)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (My dominant societies theory may have just been a natural random occurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of creative thought? or was it a reaction to some enviromental stimulus?)
</em><br>
<p>I think it is reasonable to assume that if a society can get itself
<br>
on the &quot;creative&quot; path -- and that specific path has some elements
<br>
of improving the quality of life (i.e. enabling less time required
<br>
for physical survival) -- then the society could be on an upward
<br>
spiral of creativity.  [Obviously if the vector is to develop increasingly
<br>
creative sculptures that do little to support people in the physical
<br>
reality (cheaper food, water, housing, etc.) then you end up with a
<br>
very creative society, but not one with the means to bootstrap itself
<br>
into increasing levels of creativity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please reply and add scientific data if you want to. Scientific data is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always good. My lack of it means that I am most likely wrong. It's a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing I'm more or less just asking questions.
</em><br>
<p>The books by Calvin have a reasonably good scientific basis behind them
<br>
in that he is trying to tie thought to the actual physical architecture
<br>
of neurons in the brain.
