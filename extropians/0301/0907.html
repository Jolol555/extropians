<em>&gt; One prerequisite for having a constructive discussion about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful topic is to be able to handle it on a high level of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstraction. When you know enough about a topic you can start to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at it from different sides. You can be abstract enough about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it so that you become dispassionate. 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, the more you know about a topic, when that topic turns
<br>
on Objective Truth, the more likely you are to be very passionate for
<br>
the side which you are able to objectively, quantitatively, and
<br>
qualitatively determine is in the right. The opposition begins, more
<br>
and more, to look not just wrong, but foolish, naive, stubbornly
<br>
obstinate in their willful ignorance, and willing to believe anything
<br>
that agrees with their prejudices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately people tend to debate many issues they *feel* strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about, but do not *know* much about. 
</em><br>
<p>Those on the wrong side tend to *prefer* to continue to not know much,
<br>
because they have a constitutional intolerance for being confused by
<br>
the facts.
<br>
<p>For example, I think I can demonstrate that I know more about the
<br>
aforementioned issue than anybody on this list, both in  terms of
<br>
history, law, sociology, as well as engineering and crime statistics.
<br>
Because of this expertise, those who oppose my opinion on the matter
<br>
demonstrate a rather *SEVERE* hostility whenever the subject is brought
<br>
up in my presence because they are extremely worried about being
<br>
subjected to the facts which they find so unpleasant and dislike to
<br>
admit are real, because these facts so significantly illuminate how ill
<br>
informed, hypocritical, or unreasoned their own position is.
<br>
<p>A similar debate occurs in our society with subjects like evolution.
<br>
Those who know the least about it are the most opposed to the concept.
<br>
With cloning, ditto. With stem cells, ditto. With cryonics, ditto.
<br>
<p>Recently, I saw political hack James Carville on Crossfire Live
<br>
debating the second amendment. He said, &quot;I don't think there is a 2nd
<br>
amendment right to own a gun, but I think it is a loser political
<br>
issue.&quot; He went on to describe how he enjoys hunting in his home state
<br>
and describes how he owns firearms both to hunt and to protect his
<br>
family. This sort of hypocrisy is tantamount to saying &quot;I enjoy smoking
<br>
pot both for medical reasons as well as for personal pleasure, but I
<br>
don't think it's posession should be legal.&quot;
<br>
<p>Those in the opposition dislike discussing the topic SPECIFICALLY
<br>
because they subconciously fear being proven wrong, AND having it
<br>
proven to their faces and in public how unpopular their fascist
<br>
attitudes really are.
