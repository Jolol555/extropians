I can appreciate Patti Smith's singing voice but the folks behind the
<br>
&quot;anti-war&quot; movement are an interesting hodge-podge of voices.  Although
<br>
this LA Weekly piece is dated November 2002, it describes some of those
<br>
people I am watching this morning on C-Span.  Nadia Marsh (Doctors and Nurses
<br>
Against War) is married to Brian Becker, a key WWP (Workers World Party)
<br>
organizer.  The WWP supports Kim Jong-Il's &quot;socialist country&quot; and its
<br>
isolation from the global economic system.
<br>
<p>&quot;Jesse Jackson may have been the only major figure to acknowledge Saddam’s
<br>
brutality, noting that the Iraqi dictator “should be held accountable for his
<br>
crimes.”  In 1967-68, Jackson's Operation Breadbasket sought to intimidate
<br>
white store owners to get out of black neighborhoods.  I worked in Craig's
<br>
Modern Market as a butcher's helper.  Jackson's goons came down from Chicago
<br>
to my hometown on the Ohio River: Evansville, Indiana.  These thugs told us
<br>
and our customers we were hurting the black community.  They threatened us
<br>
with brass knuckles and knives.  I lived two blocks from the market as a
<br>
minority where 90% were black.  I mowed lawns and our good neighbor across
<br>
the street, Willie Mae, called me her yard-boy.  One of the butchers was 
<br>
Dick Spain, an underwater demolitions team frogman during World War II, a
<br>
LTjg before getting out in 1946.  He and I thought it was ludicrous that
<br>
these black thugs were threatening butchers with knives.  Jesse Jackson was
<br>
and is such a hypocrite to the black community.
<br>
<p>My 0.02 cents.

<p>You'll be hearing a lot about antiwar protests in the next few days, but
<br>
our lazy press probably will not exert itself overmuch to tell you about
<br>
the jolly organizers. This connects some interesting dots.
<br>
<p>Hail Hydra!
