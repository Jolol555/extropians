<em>&gt; I think what John is expressing disdain for is the kind of

</em><br>
<p>PMJI, but IIRC the basic idea of the UN was not to implement an 
<br>
instrument &quot;to make them do like we want&quot;, but to have a common platform 
<br>
(even if it's fragile) for politics and diplomats, to solve problems and 
<br>
crisis possibly without wars.
<br>
<p>The human rights charta is one of the major achievements of the UN, but 
<br>
it will not be respected, until its promoters earn eough credibility by 
<br>
acting along its base line. No government sees any value in respecting 
<br>
human rights or international treaties, when the top politicians of the 
<br>
leading nations don't.
<br>
<p>IMHO, the necessary respect for the UN has been damaged by its top 
<br>
members, e.g. by not paying their contributions, by supporting nations 
<br>
that violate UN resolutions, by making dirty deals with dictators, by 
<br>
canceling international treaties, etc.
<br>
<p>It is not very plausible, when the US administration finds Iraq to be its 
<br>
topmost enemy, while still supporting other regimes with equal 
<br>
non-democratic, anti human rights governments. It is almost unbelievable 
<br>
to declare a country that small, that far away, for which no credible 
<br>
source has ever found a connection to the muslim terrorists, to be the 
<br>
current most dangerous threat to the free world. It is simply not 
<br>
credible, because the US, especially the Bush administration, has gambled 
<br>
away its credibility long before.
<br>
<p>To ask others to respect the UN and its resolutions, the current US 
<br>
government first has to reearn enough respect and credibility.
