<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Development of Western science is based on two
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great achievements: the invention of the formal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logical system (in Euclidean geometry) by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek philosophers, and the discovery of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possibility to find out causal relationships by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systematic experiment (during the Renaissance).&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Albert Einstein
<br>
<p>This quote precedes the dedication and table of contents of Judea
<br>
Pearl's book &quot;Causality&quot;, an overdue tome restoring the irreplaceable
<br>
concept of causality to its rightful intellectual status, and,
<br>
evidently, suggesting a useful formal tool for statisticians.
<br>
<p>The author obviously selected this quote because of its second
<br>
phrase about causal relationships.  But what about the first phrase?
<br>
I don't think it's true!
<br>
<p>Claim: formal logic played no part in the development of
<br>
Western science.  (Einstein was mistaken.)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  I have included in this post a defense of my claim, but
<br>
in case I too clearly delineate the issue along biased lines
<br>
and thus hold back good arguments, perhaps some perhaps may
<br>
wish to analyze this thesis in its absence.  So don't &quot;page down&quot;.
<br>
<p>(This isn't just egotistical on my part, for I did last summer
<br>
on this list suffer accusations that the way I lay out arguments
<br>
is often, along these lines, manipulative and disingenuous.)
<br>
<p>Defense of the above claim:
<br>
<p>(page down)
<br>
<p><p><p><p>I say that formal logic is to be distinguished from informal
<br>
logic as follows.  Suppose that a dog returns from a romp
<br>
and finds that his master's shoes still aren't on the front
<br>
porch.  It's quite possible that the dog in effect uses logic
<br>
to conclude that his master isn't home yet, by (again, in
<br>
effect) thinking &quot;if he were home, then his shoes would be
<br>
here; as they are not, he has yet to return&quot;.  This is known
<br>
as utilizing the *contrapositive*, a logical equivalent to
<br>
&quot;p implies q&quot; which takes the form &quot;if not q, then not p&quot;.
<br>
<p>Since awareness in dogs is problematical, you may wish to
<br>
replace that animal in the above argument with a small or
<br>
pre-verbal child.  I think that we ought to still consider
<br>
this to be logical behavior.
<br>
<p>Formal logic, on the other hand, arises when there is a
<br>
conscious awareness not only of the logic that is occurring,
<br>
but also of its formal aspect.  On this reading, most people
<br>
(even the most intelligent) are unaware of formal logic and
<br>
never resort to it.  Many highly intelligent people are even
<br>
able to solve rather abstract puzzles such as the following:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State the logical conclusion:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) No ducks waltz
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) No officers ever decline to waltz
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All my poultry are ducks
<br>
<p>They solve it several methods, one of which is a rapid &quot;trial
<br>
and error&quot; of quickly generating and testing hypotheses,
<br>
which Popper and others have elevated to the key principle
<br>
behind evolutionary epistemology (and PCR).  Another is
<br>
to employ a kind of visualization similar to the manipulation
<br>
of Venn-diagrams, to get a &quot;feel&quot; for what is the needed
<br>
conclusion.  Yet others seize at random upon pairs of sentences
<br>
to extract---if possible---simple syllogisms of the sort &quot;if A
<br>
implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C&quot;.
<br>
<p>(The latter method shows that by taking (3), then applying
<br>
(1), and finally comparing that result with (2), the answer
<br>
rapidly obtains.)
<br>
<p>But logicians can cast each of (1), (2), and (3) into sentences
<br>
of the predicate calculus, which includes quantifiers &quot;for all&quot;
<br>
and &quot;there exists&quot;, and solve such problems symbolically.  I say
<br>
that this is what should be taken as meant by &quot;formal logic&quot;.
<br>
<p>Aristotle practically invented formal logic, at least in
<br>
my opinion, and yet long before Aristotle mathematicians
<br>
were solving geometry problems that required little more
<br>
than pure logic.  And far before them, chiefs, shamans,
<br>
hunters, and family wranglers had also employed logic IMO,
<br>
just not formal logic.
<br>
<p>Finally, then, a tiny bit of Western mathematics, but no
<br>
Western science should be said to be based upon formal
<br>
logic.
<br>
<p>Lee
