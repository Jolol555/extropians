I have never heard of muslims having trouble in northern Sweden
<br>
due to the midnight sun. My experience is that most of them -
<br>
like everybody else - are practical about their religion and
<br>
decide on some compromise that fits the spirit of the commandment
<br>
(a typical example is how many muslims in non-muslim countries
<br>
delay their daily prayers when at work or school for later). In 
<br>
this case I would expect some nearly arbitrary cutoff time late 
<br>
in the evening/early in the morning.

<p>I think most Muslims would consider the important thing being 
<br>
that every faithful were having Ramadan at the same time, so they 
<br>
would use Earth time. As for direction, I guess it would be the 
<br>
projection of the difference vector between their position and 
<br>
Mecca onto the local horizontal plane - probably a great market 
<br>
for prayer clocks. 
<br>
<p>One interesting &quot;solution&quot; was mentioned in the roleplaying game
<br>
2300AD, where a planet with a large Muslim population got
<br>
permission to acquire a tiny grain from the Black Stone and built
<br>
their own subsidiary &quot;Mecca copy&quot; to pray towards. Not very
<br>
likely, but another solution. 
<br>
<p>Overall, people are amazing at inventing clever &quot;solutions&quot; for
<br>
the &quot;problems&quot; created by their religion. Sabbath-approved
<br>
electronics in Judaism is another favorite of mine: since you may
<br>
not start a device on the sabbath, these devices get activated by
<br>
pressing a button which cuts power to a subsystem.
