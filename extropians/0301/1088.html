they couldn't read. Extropian friends, we don't know the answers either.

<p>Spike,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the problem is that we do know some things with absolute 
<br>
certainty.  Let me digress for a moment to set up my point.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a small boy I lived in an area that was heavily Protestant. 
<br>
&nbsp;A percentage of those people were intensely against the Roman Catholic 
<br>
Church.  I watched those folks and as I grew in experience I came to know 
<br>
something of the RCs personally.  Those folks that were so anti RC were 
<br>
totally ignorant of their subject.  In the end the thing that fascinated me 
<br>
was this: as totally wrong as the anti RC crowd was they were totally sincere 
<br>
and often in other ways fine people.  Please keep that thought in mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, about five years ago, I ran into my first Moslem that hated 
<br>
Americans.  When he started explaining himself I shut up an listened.  It was 
<br>
the same as above but with much more hate.  When he ran down and quit spewing 
<br>
filth I tried reasoning with him.  I was totally unsuccessful on even the 
<br>
most minor points.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A group of those folks have been attacking us the past ten years.  
<br>
Sadaam himself first started killing Americans with out right military 
<br>
attacks roughly 20 years ago.  The only reasons they have given that make any 
<br>
sense to me is that we are an influence in a region where they want to be top 
<br>
dog and hence they want us out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't say so but what they do say translates that way.  For 
<br>
example Osama wants us off the holy soil of Saudi Arabia.  Yet we know that 
<br>
he wants to take over Saudi Arabia and that our presence is a deterant.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end I don't think this can be fairly described as a debate 
<br>
between hawks and doves.  This is a debate between those that know they are 
<br>
being attacked and wish to defend themselves on the one hand.  On the other 
<br>
hand are those that do not wish to publicly admit that we are being attacked 
<br>
for no justifiable reason.
