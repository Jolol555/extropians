Hold on: I'm not going to keep on with a non-extropian issue, but what is important here is the court's opinion, not what happens. Imagine if a US court said it was okay for LA police officers to pick up unarmed uninvolved black and hispanic &quot;volunteers&quot; as shields/decoys for drug busts on armed black and hispanic crack distribution centres. Every American newspaper would be quivering with righteous indignation. Or imagine the same deal, except with unarmed uninvolved Arab Americans and al Qaeda hideouts. There's still be righteous indignation despite the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;.

<p>My source on the report was the PBS Newshour with Jim Lehrer, crosschecked with Israeli english-language newspapers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Seeing there's so many war postings, here's another one. &quot;In August, human rights groups praised a Supreme Court injunction against Israeli soldiers using Palestinians as protection in raids on suspected Islamic militants.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The court on Tuesday amended the ruling to say soldiers could use Palestinians if the Palestinians agreed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While the military denies using Palestinians as human shields, journalists have documented the practice.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Its sure is entirely possible that this occurred. But then many &quot;journalists&quot; had reported that Jenin was leveled, and thousands slaughtered. This was demonstarted to be propaganda, even by the scumbags in the UN. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come to doubt the veracity of &quot;news&quot; from all sources, and have decided to analyze as best I can; motivations, actions, and eventual results. If the eventual results do not add up, something has been misreported, at best; or I have been lied to, at worst.
