<em>&gt; &gt; Say, you know what?  You might be just the guy to tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Israelis and Palestinians how to get along!  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not I, but the US plus every government involved.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, (as I think you realize), I was being highly
<br>
sarcastic.  And (as we have seen!) no collection of
<br>
governments on Earth can merely talk any two enemies
<br>
into being decent to each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would be your alternative? I mean, the alternative for the long run, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a decade at least. Peace is not only the absence of open war. When the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hawks on both sides try to spread hatred and divide people into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unforgiving opponents, what else could work against that but diplomatics?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I readily confess that &quot;solving&quot; the Israeli-Palestinian
<br>
in an acceptable fashion is rather beyond my capabilities too!
<br>
The number of deaths per capita and per year could be much 
<br>
worse; as for getting the Palestinians in the Gaza strip on their
<br>
feet economically (along with the rest of them too, of course)
<br>
might be possible if some Western country conquered them, set
<br>
up factories, and exploited them.  But it doesn't look like there
<br>
really would be much profit in it, unfortunately.  (But it might
<br>
give France something to do.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We've seen more astonishing things than that.  The peace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treaty between Israel and Egypt for example.
</em><br>
<p>Not the way I read it.  Now, I'm no great expert (that's
<br>
for sure), but I think that what happened was that Jimmy
<br>
Carter sat down with Begin and Sadat and said, essentially:
<br>
<p>&quot;Look here.  I had a very simple idea that will make 
<br>
all three of us look really good, and be quite profitable.
<br>
I'll just get the United States to pay each of you five
<br>
billion dollars or so a year to be friendly.  You each
<br>
get a lot of money, and pressure off your economies, and I
<br>
get a Nobel peace prize.  Nobody loses.  Except the American
<br>
tax-payer of course, but, anybody that stupid deserves to
<br>
get the short stick, they'll not even notice.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every terrorist act has but one goal: To spread hatred, angst and raise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudices. See Israel: &quot;All Palestinians are suicide bombers&quot;. See 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palestine: &quot;All Israelis are occupants&quot;. See us: &quot;All Arabs are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists&quot;. This circle cannot be broken with weapons.
</em><br>
<p>You depict these groups as being reality-challenged.  They
<br>
only *talk* like that to arouse their peoples, and at least
<br>
for well-informed people in Israel or the West, such simplistic
<br>
talk is double-edged at best.  I know exactly how &quot;All Arabs
<br>
are terrorists&quot; would fly if enunciated by George Bush---
<br>
everyone would know that he had made the most idiotic statement
<br>
of his life.
<br>
<p>It's much simpler than that.  Two groups want exactly the
<br>
same thing.  Israel has the better army, and so that's how
<br>
it's going to stay.  (Unless certain friends are able to
<br>
lob five or ten nukes into Israel---but fortunately, no
<br>
Middle Eastern power has such weapons, even though a 
<br>
certain notorious suspect has been working on them for
<br>
more than twenty years.  Maybe he'll soon succeed, there'll
<br>
be a holocaust, and &quot;peace&quot; will be achieved.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Oh, this should definitely be mentioned not only to the Israelis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Palestinians, but we should &quot;make clear&quot; that other nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should cease executions of politicians, and that it's not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accepted instrument of politics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly.  To every nation including our own.
</em><br>
<p>Don't you sense the utter futility of such talk?  Unless
<br>
incentives are involved, it's worse than useless to mouth
<br>
such platitudes.  One nation in today's world can &quot;make
<br>
clear&quot; that X is not acceptable only by use of punishments
<br>
or rewards that involve the incentives of the other party.
<br>
You can either pay them to be nice, as Jimmy Carter did,
<br>
or you can threaten them with economic sanctions (which
<br>
only sometimes have an effect), or you can threaten to 
<br>
harm them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should we both write a letter to Mr. Bush, telling him to please 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observe the agreement of the international court of justice and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to revoke the find and kill order he gave to the CIA?
</em><br>
<p>I can't believe you are serious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wouldn't that make telling others to be lawful a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more credible?
</em><br>
<p>You mean if he suddenly *saw* how right you were, was
<br>
born again, got religion, or underwent some other 
<br>
deep aberration of brain function?  Well, even if 
<br>
his close advisors, family, and friends didn't immediately
<br>
have him committed to an asylum, well, no, &quot;others&quot; around
<br>
the world would just pity him.  &quot;Telling others to be
<br>
lawful&quot; didn't even used to work with my elementary school
<br>
teachers, even though they had vast power over the children.
<br>
The teachers who could maintain class discipline understood
<br>
the incentives (i.e. fears and hopes) of the children.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I suggest you try reading Machiavelli for starters.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; history of most eras might also, if read with enough cynicism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provide very informative lessons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The major part of known history is made of immoral and selfish rulers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who plundered their own country and raided others if possible. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is whether we can continue this type of politics, when only two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dozen determined men can turn a super power into a raving Rambo.
</em><br>
<p>You are right that a lot of progress has been made.  Why
<br>
doesn't the U.S. just drop four or five 20-megaton H-bombs
<br>
on Iraq and be done with it?  Because, fundamentally, U.S.
<br>
public opinion would be outraged.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Machiavelli was possible in his times, and even then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the methods he described caused a lot of suffering.
</em><br>
<p>No; as Anders points out, he was a great advance over his
<br>
times.  He pointed out how leaders can be effective and
<br>
not just talk meaninglessly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, he was totally undemocratic and would have given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing for human rights.  He therefore cannot be a role 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model for modern politics in an interdependent world.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  More about him in the thread Anders started.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, we have to make sure that his followers have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no chance to come to power.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the modern &quot;followers&quot; of his advice are by necessity
<br>
much more restrained than he was because we live in better
<br>
times (there has been much progress).  But people *like*
<br>
him in their realism and understanding are exactly the 
<br>
smart people that should be, and mostly are, running
<br>
governments around the world.
