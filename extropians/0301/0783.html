<p>You have an unerring instinct for alluding to unpleasant truths.  :-(
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&quot;unhealthy babies&quot; will be a mere transition effect...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A suspicious assumption.  Remember why sexual reproduction evolved -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a static set of genes is more vulnerable to rapidly evolving germs.
</em><br>
<p>What is the relevance?  The huge burst of trillions of
<br>
new cells indeed does leave the old body's pathogens in
<br>
the dust.  But the new body has the same explosion, and
<br>
the pathogens don't go along because they're not in the
<br>
DNA.
<br>
<p>But your great instincts perhaps anticipated Hal's post
<br>
&quot;Risks of IVF, implications for cloning?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Or are you are thinking about cloned babies being in
<br>
proximity to their originals, and that the germs would
<br>
have two lifetimes instead of one to &quot;solve&quot; the problem?
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'd be perfectly willing to chance it, and would
<br>
be happy to pay some woman to bear my clone, if only we
<br>
lived in a free country and contracts were enforceable.
