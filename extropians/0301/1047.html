How easy are Wikis to hook into other data flows? For example, is a
<br>
Wiki-mailing list or Wiki-Forum hybrid with automated cross-posting a viable
<br>
beastie?

<em>&gt; I think a Wiki for Extropian topics would be a great idea!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The one for SL4 has only been up a couple weeks and it's already showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great promise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does not replace the need for the mailing list though, but once a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topics been thoroughly hashed out on the list it could show up in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wiki as a page or pages.
