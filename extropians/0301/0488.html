<p>Not to &quot;speed up&quot; mutation, but as a side effect of transposons
<br>
that do function to speed up mutation.  It's the &quot;waste&quot; left
<br>
over after you finish cutting a pattern out of the cloth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The presense of more DNA would speed up the rate of mutation.
</em><br>
<p>No, rates of mutation are reasonably stable -- organisms, particularly
<br>
lower organisms with short life cycles, can vary them to match the
<br>
environmental conditions (harsh environment... current program isn't
<br>
working... increase mutation rate to get a better program...).  This
<br>
is a &quot;real&quot; phenomena, its called the &quot;SOS response&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also it might have some effect on recombination of chromosomes, crossing over.
</em><br>
<p>Evidence for this has only recently come to light.  I've seen at least
<br>
one reference that suggests that the junk DNA may play a role in chromosome
<br>
alignment for recombination purposes.  But there *are* organisms, e.g.
<br>
Fugu, with very little junk DNA so this function isn't &quot;essential&quot; for life
<br>
or evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might even have messages to sabatogue the DNA in some sense to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more mutations or other changes.
</em><br>
<p>The primary purpose of transposons is the entire &quot;selfish-gene&quot; hypothesis --
<br>
i.e. to make copies of themselves.  *But* in so doing they also seem to
<br>
make copies of other &quot;useful&quot; genes.  That allows organisms to keep one
<br>
copy of a gene doing its old function while evolving a new copy of a
<br>
gene to do something novel (and potentially useful from an evoluationary
<br>
standpoint).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Either way just by exsisting whether it does anything or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speeds up evolution. Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>Transposons (which are the source of junk DNA) do speed up evolution.
<br>
However, there may be a secondary use for junk DNA which is to
<br>
function as a &quot;free radical/toxin sink&quot;.  This is very unclear at
<br>
this point since one may have organisms with similar lifespans
<br>
with very different amounts of junk DNA (so the extent to which
<br>
this strategy is used is very unclear).  But it does make logical
<br>
sense -- if an organism is consuming X amount of toxins or generating
<br>
Y amount of free radicals due to metabolic activity then it would
<br>
be much better if those agents were damaging &quot;junk&quot; DNA than &quot;useful&quot;
<br>
DNA.  It is, to my knowledge, a poorly studied area of biology.
