<p>Giant Fort Lauderdale software maker Citrix sues state, says First Amendment
<br>
bans taxing information companies
<br>
<p>Julie Kay
<br>
Miami Daily Business Review
<br>
12-19-2002
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>One of Florida's largest public companies has filed a lawsuit against the
<br>
Florida Department of Revenue invoking a unique legal theory that it should
<br>
be exempt from paying taxes because it is protected under the First
<br>
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. 
<br>
<p>Fort Lauderdale-based Citrix Systems, a manufacturer of computer software,
<br>
is seeking a refund of about $5 million in state corporate income taxes that
<br>
it paid over the last five years. 
<br>
<p>Citrix is relying on an unusual legal theory -- that all companies acting as
<br>
purveyors of information and facilitators of communications, including
<br>
newspapers, TV stations, telephone companies and computer companies, are
<br>
constitutionally exempt from paying taxes of any kind. That, according to
<br>
Citrix, includes both the federal and state income taxes corporations pay
<br>
and the state sales tax that customers pay every time they buy a newspaper,
<br>
magazine or computer. 
<br>
<p>The class action lawsuit, filed last week in Broward Circuit Court, has
<br>
surprised and amused tax watch groups, law professors, tax attorneys and the
<br>
Department of Revenue, whose spokesman responded to questions about the
<br>
lawsuit with peals of laughter. 
<br>
<p>But the action, filed by a publicly traded company that posted $378.7
<br>
million in revenues for the nine months ended Sept. 30, should not be
<br>
dismissed too quickly as the latest in a long line of wacky attempts to
<br>
argue that the government has no constitutional right to levy taxes, experts
<br>
said. 
<br>
<p>It was filed by Boca Raton, Fla., tax lawyer Allen Libow, who said he has
<br>
won previous lawsuits against the Department of Revenue, including one
<br>
brought by a Boca Raton magazine that recently was affirmed by the 4th
<br>
District Court of Appeal. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This is a very substantial corporation in Florida, with substantial
<br>
assets,&quot; said Dominic Calabro, executive director of the Tallahassee,
<br>
Fla.-based TaxWatch, a taxpayer group. &quot;Obviously, they feel serious enough
<br>
to file this. I'm surprised. It's a very interesting argument they're
<br>
making.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, said he also
<br>
was surprised that a large company like Citrix would file such a lawsuit.
<br>
&quot;Usually it's the crackpots,&quot; he said. Still, he predicted the lawsuit would
<br>
go nowhere: &quot;This doesn't even pass the laugh test. The government would go
<br>
out of business and we would have anarchy if people didn't pay taxes.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In the suit, Citrix is seeking to make all of its computer software
<br>
customers plaintiffs in the potential class action. Those customers include
<br>
499 of the Fortune 500 companies. 
<br>
<p>'WHOLE THING IS WRONG' 
<br>
<p>The lawsuit grows out of a dispute between Citrix and the state tax agency
<br>
that began several years ago when the Department of Revenue started auditing
<br>
the company. Citrix sought a $90,000 refund because it felt it was entitled
<br>
to an exemption for research and development costs. The tax agency
<br>
disagreed. Citrix filed a protest, and was denied. 
<br>
<p>Deciding that the state was &quot;dead wrong&quot; in its decision, David Carls,
<br>
manager of corporate taxes for Citrix, said the company started examining
<br>
its entire tax liability. Carls and Libow, a partner at Libow &amp; Muskat who
<br>
is the company's outside tax lawyer, decided that Citrix should pay no state
<br>
or federal taxes, neither income or sales taxes. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We decided the whole thing is wrong,&quot; Carls said. &quot;The government is
<br>
practicing discrimination in how it taxes various entities. I think this is
<br>
something whose time has come.&quot; 
<br>
<p>On Dec. 9, with the approval of its top executives -- but without a vote by
<br>
the board of directors -- Citrix took a step that anti-tax libertarians
<br>
would applaud. It sued the state tax agency, seeking a refund of some $5
<br>
million -- all the state corporate income tax it paid between 1996 and 2001,
<br>
the audited period. Citrix paid Libow between $40,000 and $60,000 to file
<br>
the lawsuit. The rest of the case will be on a contingency basis. 
<br>
<p>The case has been assigned to Judge Robert Lance Andrews. Citrix is in the
<br>
process of notifying all its vendors and customers that they are going to be
<br>
part of a class action against the Department of Revenue and may opt out if
<br>
they wish. 
<br>
<p>'CHILLING EFFECT' 
<br>
<p>The reason purveyors of information are exempt from taxation, according to
<br>
the suit, is that taxes have a chilling effect on the First Amendment right
<br>
to free speech under the U.S. Constitution. 
<br>
<p>&quot;By assessing and collecting Florida income and emergency excise tax,&quot;
<br>
states the lawsuit, &quot;the DOR is restricting the freedom to circulate this
<br>
information, in direct violation of established United States and Florida
<br>
constitutional principles, as said tax scheme is discriminatory on its face
<br>
between not only similarly situated speakers, but to the recipients of such
<br>
speech, as well.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Added Carls: &quot;The framers of the Constitution did not have in mind that free
<br>
speech should be taxed. If you really think about it, economic restriction
<br>
is equivalent to forcible restriction. When CBS or CNN buys a camera for the
<br>
studio, for every 10 cameras they buy they could have bought an 11th if they
<br>
didn't have to pay taxes.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Various groups over the years have tried to claim that the government has no
<br>
constitutional right to levy taxes. Last year, the We the People Foundation,
<br>
a tax-exempt educational charity based in Queensbury, N.Y., launched an
<br>
advertising campaign to make its case that the 16th Amendment, allowing
<br>
income taxes, was fraudulently adopted. 
<br>
<p>The courts repeatedly have rejected such theories. Three years ago, Congress
<br>
increased the penalties for making such arguments against the tax laws in
<br>
court to $25,000, up from $5,000. But such challenges continue. Around the
<br>
country, various individuals sell tax-evasion schemes, and leaders of
<br>
militia and &quot;patriot&quot; organizations, as well as business owners, have
<br>
stopped withholding taxes from their workers' paychecks. 
<br>
<p>One prominent tax lawyer who did not want to be identified called it
<br>
foolhardy for Citrix to take this legal tack. He said Citrix should have
<br>
sued just to recoup its $90,000 refund, not on the larger issue. 
<br>
<p>&quot;When you deal with the DOR, you play it by the book,&quot; said the lawyer.
<br>
&quot;Somebody convinced Citrix to go along with this.&quot; He noted that a major
<br>
convenience store chain sued the Department of Revenue in the early 1980s
<br>
and wound up facing criminal charges for allegedly withholding taxes. 
<br>
<p>While he calls the First Amendment issue &quot;an interesting question of law
<br>
that we will follow,&quot; Calabro of TaxWatch said the real test of whether a
<br>
tax is constitutional is whether it is applied across the board, in a fair
<br>
and even-handed manner. Since media and information companies are not
<br>
charged a special tax, the Department of Revenue appears to be fair in its
<br>
treatment of them, he said. 
<br>
<p>The agency &quot;reviewed the issues raised by [Citrix] and finds them not to be
<br>
meritorious,&quot; said agency spokesman Dave Bruns with a laugh. &quot;We're looking
<br>
forward to our day in court.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Bruns said &quot;the constitutionality of income tax is well-settled law that has
<br>
been in place for many years. There have been challenges in other states and
<br>
with the federal government, but rarely by software producers. Usually they
<br>
are by taxpayer protest groups.&quot; 
<br>
<p>When informed that the Department of Revenue spokesman laughed about the
<br>
lawsuit, Libow responded, &quot;We'll see how funny this is when it winds up in
<br>
court.&quot; He noted the case is before Judge Andrews, an unpredictable jurist
<br>
who has taken on government in the past and made controversial rulings. 
<br>
<p>Libow previously has sued the Department of Revenue successfully, though on
<br>
much narrower grounds. He was victorious in a lawsuit he brought on behalf
<br>
of Soap Opera Magazine, which is owned by Boca Raton-based American Media.
<br>
The department wanted to tax photos the magazine bought from free-lancers,
<br>
but did not similarly tax newspapers, such as its sister paper, the Weekly
<br>
World News. Libow sued for discriminatory practices, among other grounds,
<br>
and won the suit. It was affirmed by the 4th District Court of Appeal. 
<br>
<p>MIAMI HERALD SAID NO 
<br>
<p>Libow said Citrix's customers may opt out of the lawsuit if they wish, but
<br>
are automatically included if class certification is granted. He said he
<br>
likely will expand the lawsuit to name the Internal Revenue Service as a
<br>
defendant -- but first wants to gain support from other tech companies in
<br>
Silicon Valley. &quot;Citrix doesn't want to be singled out,&quot; he said. &quot;They
<br>
don't want this to be seen as big business trying to save money.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Libow has also been contacting newspapers and magazines around the country
<br>
to solicit their participation in the lawsuit. He met with officials of the
<br>
Miami Herald to discuss the matter, but the Herald ultimately decided not to
<br>
join in, said Herald general manager Jesus Diaz, who declined to say why. 
<br>
<p>American Media, of Delray Beach, Fla., was also contacted by Libow. But the
<br>
company declined to comment on the issue. 
<br>
<p>Carl said his company is not afraid of taking on the state Revenue
<br>
Department. &quot;They've got all the power in the world to audit you,&quot; he said.
<br>
&quot;I hope they're not picking and choosing who they're going to audit by these
<br>
things. The bottom line is, the Department of Revenue has been less than
<br>
fair to us.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Will Citrix drop its lawsuit if the DOR simply capitulates and gives the
<br>
company the requested $90,000 refund? &quot;No way,&quot; said Libow, insisting that
<br>
the lawsuit is not a negotiating ploy. &quot;This is going all the way. I'm sure
<br>
it will end up in the U.S. Supreme Court. This is a very, very serious
<br>
matter.&quot;
