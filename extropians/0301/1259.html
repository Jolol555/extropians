</em><br>
<p>A bit, yes. Just because it makes me sick to get so quickly judged.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What mainly distinguishes so called &quot;first world&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries is rule of law.  Second is economic and technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress, and a close third is form of government (where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is independent of the most important &quot;rule of law&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>Have you seen the large amount of cases, where innocent people were 
<br>
convicted, sometimes even executed? Hundreds of cases which can now be 
<br>
proven by DNA checks. And these are only the clear cases. You may 
<br>
estimate, how many innocent people are in jail, in the country with the 
<br>
highest rate of jail inmates in the western world.
<br>
<p>Have you seen those &quot;boot camps&quot; or the prison of that silly sheriff in 
<br>
Arizona, where the human rights and the dignity of the inmates end at the 
<br>
front gate?
<br>
<p>The GDR has also been &quot;lawful&quot;. States following the Sharia are &quot;lawful&quot;. 
<br>
It's the moral quality of the law that matters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Human [legal] rights&quot; are still fully protected for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, except for statistically insignificant cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that definitely occur in large ( &gt;100M ) countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Big Brother&quot; happened in Orwell's book, [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but no longer occurs [...] So is the U.S.
</em><br>
<p>Well, from my view, gathering lists with customer names plus book titles 
<br>
from book shops and libraries, customer lists from diving schools, FBI 
<br>
&quot;interviews&quot; with people saying something against the government, the 
<br>
president or way of politics, is as &quot;big brother&quot; as Gestapo and GDR 
<br>
Stasi have been. Putting poeple into jail without any notice, no charges 
<br>
given, no lawyer present for months, fits into the &quot;disappering people&quot; 
<br>
scheme of banana republics. It surely does not fit into the picture of a 
<br>
country claiming to be the moral leader of the &quot;free&quot; world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps you need a vacation.  In California.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, thanks :-) I have been there - and through the west, nine weeks long. 
<br>
Nice trip, beautiful landscape. We even met natives. Very funny people. 
<br>
Most of them didn't know where Germany really is; asked if we came all 
<br>
the way by car. Some asked if we still celebrate Emperor Wilhelm II. 
<br>
birthday, some others if Hitler still rules. And for the more trivial 
<br>
questions: yes, we do have microwave ovens and electric light, no, we are 
<br>
neither living in tents nor in caves :-)
<br>
<p>No, I am not anti-american, not even anti-US. In my opinion, there's 
<br>
something wrong with the system (see human rights above), the government 
<br>
(see Iraq war) and the double measure of ethics. From my point of view, 
<br>
the US regime has left the way of the Golden Rule and the Categorical 
<br>
Imperative both, in internal and international politics.
