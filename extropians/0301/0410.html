<p><em>&gt; ### Most people with severe deformities resent their disability (a fact). We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to use probabilistic arguments about the child, and assume that she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will develop the common attitude, rather than her mother's idiosyncratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distaste for limbs.  Therefore, the Golden Rule (in the form of veil of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance) demands that we act in the predicted interest of the child, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop/punish her mother.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, I balk when I read phrases like &quot;Golden rule demands&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;we act&quot;, and &quot;predicted interest&quot;.  Surely you feel some unease
<br>
with these terms and all that they imply.
<br>
<p>Don't forget Hal's post of Monday 1/6/2003 6:54 PM which included
<br>
<p>&quot;It's not a simple issue.  And looking forward, what happens if everyone
<br>
else starts enhancing their children with some kind of neural interface
<br>
that makes them seem inhuman?  Is it really wrong for someone to say
<br>
that they want their kids to grow up the same way as their ancestors
<br>
have done?  It might not be Extropian, but I think we can all recognize
<br>
the discomfort that someone would feel if they knew their children were
<br>
going to be fundamentally unlike them, foreign in some way.&quot;
<br>
<p>To wax satirical for a moment, I can just see you &quot;acting&quot;
<br>
to &quot;save the children&quot; of religious non-conformists who
<br>
don't want their children enhanced with the latest gadgetry
<br>
or genes.  I mean, you already think it perfectly justified
<br>
for the state to remove children from the care of &quot;unfit&quot;
<br>
parents, or force medical treatments upon them which the
<br>
parents oppose.  BTW, do you ever get a little charge out
<br>
of getting to use the word &quot;force&quot;?, (a not entirely fair
<br>
question.)
