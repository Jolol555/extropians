<em>&gt;

<p>Just had a look at the powerpoint presentation. Looks like it would
<br>
have/will be a very good initiative. Closest thing I've seen to strategic
<br>
assessment of
<br>
the competitive meme-scape in terms of particular organisations and their
<br>
agendas. Good stuff. Sorry it was brought to a halt, particularly in the way
<br>
that it was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;In my experience many people and groups find it exceptionally
</em><br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure about this, but I do now that in the art world, criticism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected and utilized.  Art critics are in high demand and studio artists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (painters and electronic artists) rely on criticism for our work. It is
</em><br>
how
<br>
<em>&gt; we are taught to cogitate and conjecture.
</em><br>
<p>I think it varies from person to person but I'd take a fair bit of
<br>
convincing
<br>
that artists as a class are generally better than most at taking criticism.
<br>
<p>But which art critics? And in demand by whom - the artists, or galleries,
<br>
magazines, investors, art is business too.
<br>
<p>I suspect you are not a typical instance of the class of people that are
<br>
artist. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On a more objective stance, I think extropians are similarly interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism for their/our growth and also, importantly, for our reliability.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. But still. Perhaps I can make more point about the power of
<br>
perceptions to influence intelligent scientifically trained people by
<br>
reference
<br>
to the double blind procedure used in drug testing. The use it, because they
<br>
found they needed too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, I do agree that there are many people, including extropians, who
</em><br>
react
<br>
<em>&gt; defensively and I'm sure we all bear that burden at some point or another.
</em><br>
<p>Yes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ExI is a political organization, which it is NOT and claims no particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affiliation with ANY one political mindset, platform or organization.
</em><br>
<p>This was important enough for a separate thread I thought.
<br>
