<p>For some preference relationship(s). Yours?
<br>
<p>What of the people who [say they] wish they had never been born?
<br>
<p>? contented &gt; suffering &gt; null ?
<br>
<p>? resigned &gt; struggling &gt; never-born ?
<br>
<p>Says who? On what basis? On a bad day, I think things won't get better. What if bad days are as good as it gets?
<br>
<p>The problems of informed versus retroactive consent are many. So are the problems of an entity's
<br>
chattel versus sovereign status--even sans the hard-edged duality implied by that way of putting it.
<br>
<p>One philology source I've read claims the ancient Greeks and Romans didn't even have a word for
<br>
leaving newborns out on flat rocks if they didn't seem fit. Supposedly, the term &quot;infanticide&quot;
<br>
was coined by a much later Christian scholar. Go figure.
<br>
<p>I have no recipe.
<br>
<p>I have a solution, but the margins of this email are too small to contain the proof.
<br>
<p>As is any subsection of an entire lifetime. Maybe.
