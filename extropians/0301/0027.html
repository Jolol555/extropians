-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Jeff Davis [mailto:<a href="mailto:jrd1415@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20Noam%20Chomsky%20(was%20RE:%20join%20The%20American%20Peace%20Movement)">jrd1415@yahoo.com</a>] 
<br>
<p>&quot;This series of exchanges has been largely a waste of time.  Old men
<br>
fighting old battles long past.  Hell!,
<br>
my side--the right side--prevailed--though at horrific cost--back when it
<br>
was the central event of my generation.  &quot;
<br>
<p>As an extropian, I find it striking that you DON'T consider yourself
<br>
'anti-communist'.  I am sure your 'victory' and your victory lap would make
<br>
the 1 million south vietmanese who perished in the six months following US
<br>
withdrawel (more people than died in the entire conflict) from Indochina,
<br>
and the 2 - 3 million cambodians who were murdered feel much better, if they
<br>
werent all dead.  
<br>
<p>Your claims have focused on the previously held agreement that the south and
<br>
north were one country, I ask you, what moral claim does a country have to
<br>
exist?  Can a country based on oppression rightfully make ANY moral claim to
<br>
existence?  Does it have a 'right' to exist?  Since it does not respect
<br>
rights of individuals, it clearly can make no claims to rights.  It is a
<br>
nation built on oppression, threats, pain, and murder.  This is the nation
<br>
that WON, and this is the victory that you are PROUD of.  I have a sincere
<br>
difficulty in understanding why you consider the events in vietnam a
<br>
'victory'  A victory for who?  It certainly wasn't for the millions of
<br>
people who were oppressed, murdered, and enslaved as a result of the US
<br>
withdrawel from Indochina.  I simply can not understand what you consider a
<br>
victory.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael
