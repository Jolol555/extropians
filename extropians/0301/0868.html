<p>Hmm, this seem to be very similiar to a lot of old pulp sf stories. Tom 
<br>
Strong, anyone?
<br>
<p>Maybe the reason it has not been discussed before (besides extraneous
<br>
complications like public distaste for eugenics and cloning done by tiny
<br>
self-appointed elites) is that it is based on a faulty chain of 
<br>
correlations: high IQ =&gt; genes for high IQ =&gt; a clone will be 
<br>
potentially high IQ =&gt; good upbringing makes this potentiality real =&gt; 
<br>
several really smart people help accelerate the singularity. 
<br>
<p>Imagine that each implication has a correlation of 0.8 (which is likely
<br>
far higher for several of these than it is in reality). Then the total
<br>
correlation would be just 0.4 - far less, although still non-zero. This
<br>
is the same effect that makes the contribution of genetic IQ to the
<br>
inheritance of social class so minor compared to other inheritance
<br>
factors (like growing up in the right social networks etc). 
<br>
<p>The most unlikely assumptions are the later ones. Especially the
<br>
assumption that having around a small number of people that have got a
<br>
great upbringing (note that this can be awfully hard too - what is the
<br>
right upbringing for a child in the first place? If one of them wants to
<br>
become a fireman, priest or luddite, should it be promoted or not?) and
<br>
are likely to be smart will accelerate progress. We already have
<br>
*millions* of smart people with fairly good upbringings, plenty of those
<br>
the children of top IQ researchers and scholars. 20 clones will be a
<br>
drop in the ocean. While breakthroughs are made by individual minds,
<br>
they are so rare that they would not correlate very strongly with any
<br>
particular group (after all, how many more Nobel laureates per capita
<br>
are in Mensa than outside?). 
<br>
<p>If you want to accelerate the singularity, isn't it more cost-efficient 
<br>
to find ways of bringing extra stimulation to the already existing kids 
<br>
that have good potential but too little stimulation? Maybe Sesame Street 
<br>
2.0 is more powerful than the cloning vat.
