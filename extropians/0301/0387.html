<p>Here's a bit of curious lore from the history of
<br>
the Seventh Day Adventist meme, which started in
<br>
the U.S. in the 1840s.  Around 1860 god told the
<br>
prophetess Ellen G. White to send missionaries
<br>
to the rest of the world, which consisted in those
<br>
days of the European continent.
<br>
<p>The meme didn't sell in England, didn't sell in
<br>
France, didn't sell in Spain, Italy or Germany.
<br>
But in one of history's many curiously unexplainable
<br>
happenstances, it caught on like wildfire in...
<br>
Sweden.  (Why Sweden, Anders?)
<br>
<p>Turns out, about the same time, god told Ellen
<br>
that sabbath would be observed not midnight to
<br>
midnight as had been their custom, but rather from
<br>
sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.  This created
<br>
a hardship for the Swedes, for in winter it would
<br>
nuke two workdays as sunset receded to not much
<br>
past noon.  Indeed the far north, Swedes would have
<br>
no sunset, for on some winter days there was no
<br>
sunrise.
<br>
<p>The local Swedish Jews had managed to work out
<br>
an arrangement, or rather the more open-minded ones
<br>
among them, of observing Shabbos from 6 PM to 6 PM
<br>
the year around.  The more traditional minded Jews
<br>
observed Shabbos strictly according the heavenly
<br>
signs, inconvenient or no.
<br>
<p>The perplexed Swedish Adventists wrote to Sister White
<br>
in a letter that has been preserved.  They asked, should
<br>
we observe the holy hours from 6 to 6, or shall we
<br>
observe strictly by the sun?
<br>
<p>She prayed fervently, then advised them to
<br>
move south.
<br>
<p>The exploding Swedish Seventh Day Adventist movement
<br>
imploded.  It has never recovered to this day.
<br>
<p>I don't expect the SDA meme to sell in LEO or on
<br>
Mars either.
