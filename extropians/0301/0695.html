<p>
You know, you meet people who grew up in the age of newspapers and 
<br>
magazines, and they'll read just one article and get their information 
<br>
from that.  Sad, really.
<br>
<p>My child... have you let Google into your heart?
<br>
<p>I've visited Lomborg.com, Anti-Lomborg.com, read the Scientific American 
<br>
critique, and have simultaneously read Lomborg's point-by-point reply to 
<br>
the critique along with Scientific American's counterreplies to Lomborg's 
<br>
critique, split over two monitors.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.lomborg.com/critique.htm">http://www.lomborg.com/critique.htm</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF</a>
<br>
<p>My advice is to ignore nontechnical articles, as of the popular news 
<br>
media, as they are rich on accusations (on both sides) but short on facts.
<br>
<p>Overall, my impression would be that while Lomborg takes hits, he scores 
<br>
two to three times as many serious points against his opponents as they do 
<br>
against him.  In only three cases does a Scientific American critic make 
<br>
what seems to me to be a serious point; in one case, that Lomborg quotes 
<br>
nuclear power as supplying 20% of power used in nuclear-equipped 
<br>
countries, when it actually generates 20% of grid electricity and only 10% 
<br>
of power.  Lomborg correctly says &quot;Sorry, you've caught a genuine error&quot; 
<br>
and promises to post an erratum on his website.  In the second case, 
<br>
Lomborg's analysis of species extinction involves a projection of forested 
<br>
area which fails to distinguish between old-growth habitats and new 
<br>
forests.  In the third case, Lomborg quotes a researcher as saying species 
<br>
extinction rates were &quot;incalculable&quot; when examining the surrounding 
<br>
context reveals that the researcher probably meant &quot;very large&quot;, although 
<br>
the critic fails to dent Lomborg's point that the species extinction rate 
<br>
*is* incalculable.
<br>
<p>These points scored against Lomborg stand in contrast to the severer 
<br>
errors made by his critics, most noticeably including Schneider's 
<br>
misrepresentations of a study on the adaptive iris effect and of a study 
<br>
on the interaction of cosmic rays with global cloud cover, both of which 
<br>
were corrected by letters to Scientific American from the researchers 
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p>But then counter-errors like this one aren't really the issue; we're 
<br>
interested in whether Lomborg has made severe errors, not whether his 
<br>
critics have made worse.  In general, it looks to me like, with the three 
<br>
exceptions noted above, Lomborg replies successfully to most points made, 
<br>
even after the counterreply is taken into consideration.  Note that 
<br>
Scientific American receives the last word in this exchange; and as 
<br>
Scientific American sued Lomborg to prevent him from posting his original 
<br>
point-by-point reply on his own site, they have control over who gets the 
<br>
last word.
<br>
<p>I am not a specialist in environmental science, and am not qualified to 
<br>
make a statement about the facts of the matter being disputed.  I am not 
<br>
even qualified to know whether Lomborg is, as his critics accuse him, 
<br>
selectively quoting data.
<br>
<p>However, if Scientific American is claiming that they, in their critique 
<br>
or their counterreply, have not just asserted but *shown* Lomborg to be 
<br>
guilty of bias - to say nothing of a systematic pattern of deliberate 
<br>
scientific dishonesty - then they are simply wrong.  Having read the 
<br>
critique, the reply, and the counterreply, SciAm simply has not publicly 
<br>
presented any evidence which warrants this conclusion.
<br>
<p>Had SciAm managed to present many errors in the same class of the three 
<br>
above, they would have at least managed to keep the evidence *compatible* 
<br>
with an accusation of blatant mistakes and consistently poor scholarship 
<br>
by Lomborg.  As it is, if this is the strongest critique they could make, 
<br>
that upper bound on strength exonerates Lomborg.  The SciAm presentation 
<br>
was characterized by selective quoting and outright errors, and when these 
<br>
are pointed out, the points against Lomborg turn out to be either trivial 
<br>
or outright wrong.  Given the overall pattern of scholarship by Lomborg's 
<br>
critics I expect that they chose Lomborg's seemingly weakest points to 
<br>
criticize, rather than sampling Lomborg's book and performing deeper 
<br>
investigations at randomly selected points.  Given that even after this 
<br>
selection bias most attempted criticisms still fail, with only three 
<br>
points still standing, it seems unlikely to me that Lomborg's book is 
<br>
really of below-average scholarship.
<br>
<p>SciAm's criticism and counterreply are laced with invective, ad hominems, 
<br>
and points that are simply irrelevant to the subject at hand.  This would 
<br>
perhaps be excusable had they succeeded in making their accusations stick. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not.
<br>
<p>For example, SciAm points out that Lomborg is not himself an 
<br>
environmentalist researcher but a social scientist.  So what?  Lomborg may 
<br>
be a kindergarten student for all I care, if you cannot refute his facts. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you expect Lomborg as a nonspecialist to make mistakes, then it 
<br>
should be easy for you to find specific cases where Lomborg messed up; so 
<br>
easy, in fact, that there is absolutely no need for you to argue that 
<br>
Lomborg is a priori likely to make mistakes.  Actually, given the enormous 
<br>
range of different fields covered by the debate, even had Lomborg been a 
<br>
specialist in one field he could not have been a specialist in all.
<br>
<p>Let us assume that Lomborg's basic thesis is correct; when you consider 
<br>
the academic reaction to Lomborg, it is no wonder that this thesis was not 
<br>
presented by an insider to the field.  An environmental researcher who 
<br>
attempted to present Lomborg's thesis would have been permanently throwing 
<br>
away their career.  Even as an outsider Lomborg's scientific career has 
<br>
been damaged by the accusations leveled against him (regardless of their 
<br>
truth).  Given this, to argue that Lomborg is not an insider is 
<br>
disingenuous (cannot be evidence against Lomborg's main point), even if 
<br>
the speaker was unfamiliar with the basic rules of science and had not 
<br>
read Kuhn's &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;.
<br>
<p>The evidence does not definitely disprove any of the following scenarios:
<br>
<p>1)  Lomborg has engaged in a subtly biased presentation of a healthy 
<br>
scientific field, based on careful selection of evidence; the experts are 
<br>
capable of detecting this, but not capable of explaining what it is they 
<br>
see or why.  In frustration they have leveled massive, angry, accurate 
<br>
denunciations of Lomborg, but without being able to back up their claims 
<br>
to nonspecialists.
<br>
<p>2)  The environmentalist field has been engaging in a systematically 
<br>
biased presentation of data, which Lomborg has reviewed and then presented 
<br>
neutrally.  The environmentalist field is invested in the belief that 
<br>
environmental *activism* is critical to the survival of Earth, tends to 
<br>
selectively ignore or underreport evidence which would interfere with the 
<br>
dramatic claims needed to promote that activism, and has built up a 
<br>
fundamentally flawed scientific consensus based on the selective 
<br>
presentation of evidence at conferences, selective remembering of evidence 
<br>
by researchers to each other, and so on.  Lomborg's expose of this massive 
<br>
bias has been met with incredible anger by the activist-scientists whose 
<br>
work to promote specific political agendas has now been undermined; 
<br>
believing in their own scientific consensus, they issue drastic 
<br>
condemnations of Lomborg as a means of political damage control, but are 
<br>
then unable to back up these accusations.
<br>
<p>3)  The environmentalist field has arrived at an academically dominant 
<br>
consensus which is the result of systematically biased focus on data that 
<br>
supports the political agenda of environmental activists.  But, Lomborg's 
<br>
presentation of this data also admits of some bias in the opposite 
<br>
direction - with the note that this bias is (a) not deliberate and (b) 
<br>
considerably less than that of the environmental activist-scientists.
<br>
<p>None of these hypotheses are definitely ruled out by the evidence, but I 
<br>
would say that the evidence seems to support (3).
<br>
<p>Analyzing the pattern of critique and countercritique, Lomborg has a 
<br>
clearer focus on the facts, confronts issues more squarely, and usually 
<br>
ends up in the lead after the exchange of arguments, even though his 
<br>
critics have had the opportunity to select his weakest points out of an 
<br>
entire book.
<br>
<p>What most strongly gave me the impression of empty righteous indignation 
<br>
was the repeated accusations that Lomborg has contradicted the scientific 
<br>
consensus.  Duh.  Lomborg knows that already.  He's trying to show the 
<br>
scientific consensus is wrong.
<br>
<p>Accusations that Lomborg fails in scholarship, references, or other forms 
<br>
of scientific professionalism are simply not supported by his critics.
<br>
<p>Why (3) instead of (2)?  At one point, a critic takes Lomborg to task for 
<br>
presenting the species extinction rate as 0.7% over 50 years, instead of 
<br>
1,000 times the natural rate of species extinction, since the public might 
<br>
become less worked up over a rate of 0.7% over 50 years.  (Jesus Haploid 
<br>
Christ on a smoking birch bark canoe!  Changing the presentation of a 
<br>
statistic to manipulate public opinion?  Why not just hack off your own 
<br>
foot with an apple slicer and be done with it?)  Lomborg retorts that it 
<br>
is the 0.7% over 50 years figure that is relevant to any estimate of 
<br>
ecological wealth or its supposed decline.  Perhaps the most depressing 
<br>
part of the entire readthrough, from my perspective, was that neither the 
<br>
critic nor Lomborg thought to suggest providing BOTH figures to the public 
<br>
and letting us MAKE UP OUR OWN DARNED MINDS about which one was important. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this, it seems likely that Lomborg has an ordinary human 
<br>
rationalization mechanism operating normally (not all that suprising a 
<br>
conclusion, really) and there is probably an ordinary amount of bias in 
<br>
his reports.  The attempt by his critics to make this out to be a 
<br>
systematic pattern of dishonesty fails; they end up picking nits and often 
<br>
even the nits fail, and at any rate demonstrate a noticeably larger amount 
<br>
of rationalization and bias in their replies than they manage to accuse 
<br>
Lomborg of in his original.
<br>
<p>Final verdict:  Lomborg's not perfect, but he wins the exchange. 
<br>
Scientific American gets another black eye and absolutely does not have 
<br>
enough ammunition on hand to justify a title like &quot;Science defends itself 
<br>
against _The Skeptical Environmentalist_&quot;.
