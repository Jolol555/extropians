MaxPlumm had asked me to forward this on his behalf...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Jeff, ...I must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take issue with a large portion of your argument.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0861793.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/world/A0861793.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note the following excerpt:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Mar., 1946, France signed an agreement with Ho
</em><br>
Chi
<br>
<em>&gt; Minh, recognizing Vietnam as a free state within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indochina federation and the French Union. ...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; # I find it fascinating that you, or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically your source, cut off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the statement here. In full, it continues
</em><br>
<p>****IT DOES NOT CONTINUE**** as you state. You cite
<br>
an entirely different source. Everyone makes
<br>
mistakes, but this subject is difficult enough without
<br>
blunt misattribution. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------
<br>
<p>Perhaps your understanding of the english language is lacking, Jeff, but 
<br>
Webster's College Dictionary, Third Edition, defines statement as: &quot;a
<br>
written 
<br>
or spoken declaration&quot;. I am referring here to the DOCUMENT SIGNED BY HO CHI
<br>
<p>MINH AND JEAN SAINTENY IN PARIS IN MARCH OF 1946. The website you use as as
<br>
&nbsp;ource quotes directly from this document. But it, and you, do not includet
<br>
&nbsp;he entire article of this document. The document does say, as you quote,
<br>
<p>Ø In Mar., 1946, France signed an agreement with Ho
<br>
Chi
<br>
<em>&gt; Minh, recognizing Vietnam as a free state within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indochina federation and the French Union. ...&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But then, THE DOCUMENT FROM WHICH THIS WEBSITE QUOTES CONTINUES ON THE VERYN
<br>
&nbsp;EXT LINE...
<br>
<p>In that which concerns the reuniting of the three 'Annamite Regions' 
<br>
(Cochinchina, Annam, Tonkin) the French Government pledges itself to ratifyt
<br>
&nbsp;he decisions taken BY THE POPULATIONS CONSULTED BY REFERENDUM.
<br>
<p>That is article one of the document in its entirety. The entire document can
<br>
<p>be found, among other places, in Frederik Logevall's &quot;The Origins of the 
<br>
Vietnam War&quot;, p. 100
<br>
<p>So, once again, there were no such referendums ever held. Therefore, thisd
<br>
&nbsp;ocument is a dead letter. So, before you magically wave off an argument
<br>
that 
<br>
challenges your position, let us be perfectly clear on this. I am quotingf
<br>
&nbsp;rom the document itself, not &quot;some other source&quot; as you claim. Are you 
<br>
somehow suggesting that your website which edits the document takes 
<br>
precedence over the document signed by Ho Chi Minh himself?
