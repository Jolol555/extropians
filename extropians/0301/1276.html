Kass got to speak first *and* last. And preceded by Bottum's hand-wringing.
<br>
Somehow I don't think the order was decided by die-roll. Typical. Ah, well.
<br>
<p>Note the conciliatory initial tone of Murray and Galston. _Somebody_
<br>
on the Extro side of the street needs to have them skillz (and I do not
<br>
mean, by saying that, to imply that no one here has them). &quot;Point scoring&quot;,
<br>
taken alone, has limited utility among frail humans out in the world.

<br>
<p>Kass, Schaub, Murray, Galston, Bottum
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Five distinguished panelists--Leon R. Kass, Diana Schaub, Charles Murray,
<br>
William A. Galston, and J. Bottum--debate the report of the President's
<br>
Council on Bioethics, its recommendations, and the questions it raises about
<br>
the moral and social implications of new biotechnologies.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><p>The Public's Stake
<br>
Leon R. Kass
<br>
<p>For the first six months of this year, the President's Council on Bioethics
<br>
met to consider the moral, biomedical, and human significance of human
<br>
cloning in order to advise President Bush on the subject. The council's
<br>
report, Human Cloning and Human Dignity: An Ethical Inquiry, was issued in
<br>
July, and a paperback edition has just been published by Public Affairs.Ý
<br>
<p>Among the charges to the President's Council on Bioethics were the
<br>
following: to provide a forum for the national discussion of bioethical
<br>
issues and to facilitate a greater understanding of these issues. Our
<br>
report, in addition to providing policy recommendations, was intended to
<br>
serve both of these purposes.
<br>
<p>The commercial publication of this volume and the convening of this book
<br>
forum are intended to help us to perform our mission. I am very grateful to
<br>
Paul Golob of Public Affairs, to Chris DeMuth of the American Enterprise
<br>
Institute, and to my fellow panelists for helping us in this work.
<br>
<p>I want to summarize the content of the report in five points: First, the
<br>
council sought to examine the subject of human cloning in full by
<br>
considering the human goods that cloning might serve or endanger--not just
<br>
whether the technique is feasible or safe. We sought also to assess the
<br>
impact of growing biotechnical powers over human life and their effect on
<br>
human procreation, on the goals and limits of biomedical science, and on the
<br>
meaning of the activity of healing. It was of primary importance to put
<br>
cloning in its proper place, both humanly speaking and also in the context
<br>
of other biotechnical powers now gathering for manipulating the human body
<br>
and mind.
<br>
<p>Second, the council strived to formulate fair and accurate terminology.
<br>
Human cloning is a subject that has been bedeviled by confusing and
<br>
manipulative speech. Our goal was to clarify the terminology, beginning with
<br>
the idea of human cloning itself. Whatever the purpose for which human
<br>
cloning is undertaken, the act that produces the genetic replica is the
<br>
creation of an embryonic clone. Accordingly, the council has insisted that
<br>
what we mean by human cloning is the production of cloned human embryos, the
<br>
earliest stage of developing human life. This act of cloning may be
<br>
undertaken with the intention of either transferring these embryos to a
<br>
uterus to initiate a pregnancy or taking them apart in order to obtain stem
<br>
cells for research.
<br>
<p>In popular discussion, the first use has been called &quot;reproductive cloning&quot;
<br>
or just &quot;cloning.&quot; The second has come to be called &quot;therapeutic cloning,&quot;
<br>
&quot;research cloning,&quot; or &quot;nuclear transfer for stem cell research.&quot; The
<br>
council, instead, chose to call these uses respectively
<br>
&quot;cloning-to-produce-children&quot; and &quot;cloning-for-biomedical-research.&quot; These
<br>
terms are accurate. And they allow us to debate the moral questions without
<br>
euphemistic distortion or Orwellian speech. Whether one favors or opposes
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children, whether one favors or opposes
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research, the council insists that we must
<br>
acknowledge that both uses of cloning begin with the same act, the
<br>
production of cloned human embryos.
<br>
<p>The third point taken up by the council was the ethics of
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children. Regarding cloning-to-produce- children, the
<br>
council is in agreement with majority opinion both in America and the
<br>
Congress. The council was unanimous, in fact, that
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children should be opposed, both morally and legally. Not
<br>
only is the technique demonstrably unsafe, but it can never be safely
<br>
attempted. And the council opposes this practice not only because it is
<br>
unsafe, but because it would imperil the freedom and dignity of the cloned
<br>
child, the cloning parents, and the entire society. In its report, the
<br>
council also argues that by enabling parents for the first time to
<br>
predetermine the entire genetic makeup of their children, we would be taking
<br>
a major step toward turning procreation into manufacturing.
<br>
Cloning-to-produce-children would also confound family relations and
<br>
personal identity, create new stresses between parents and offspring, and
<br>
might open the door to a new eugenics where parents or society could
<br>
replicate the genomes of individuals whom they deem to be superior.
<br>
<p>The fourth area taken up by the council was the ethics of
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research. And here the council, like the nation, was
<br>
divided. On the one hand, we acknowledge that the research offers the
<br>
prospect, though speculative at the moment, of gaining valuable knowledge
<br>
and treatments for many diseases. On the other hand, this practice would
<br>
require the exploitation and destruction of nascent human life created
<br>
solely for the purpose of research.
<br>
<p>Individual council members weighed these moral concerns differently. Yet all
<br>
members of the council--and I am delighted about this--agreed that each side
<br>
in this debate had something vital to defend, not only for itself but for
<br>
all of us. Each side understood that we cannot afford to be casual about
<br>
human suffering, to be cavalier regarding how we treat nascent human life,
<br>
or to be indifferent about how we decide amongst the alternatives. Each side
<br>
recognized that we must face up to the moral burden of either approving or
<br>
disapproving this research, namely, on the one hand, that some who might be
<br>
healed more rapidly might not be; and on the other hand, that we will become
<br>
a society that creates and uses some human lives in the service of others.
<br>
<p>Finally, the council offered two policy recommendations, each of them
<br>
distinct from the most prominent legislative proposals considered in
<br>
Congress. Both recommendations called for a permanent ban on
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children, thus giving public force to the nation's strong
<br>
ethical verdict against this practice. Where the council differed was on how
<br>
to approach cloning-for-biomedical-research.
<br>
<p>A minority of the council recommended that we proceed now with such
<br>
potentially crucial research, but only with significant regulations in
<br>
place, including federal licensing, oversight, and strict limits on how long
<br>
cloned embryos may be allowed to develop. A majority of the council, myself
<br>
included, recommended that no human cloning of any kind be permitted at this
<br>
time. We proposed that Congress enact a ban on all attempts at
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children and a four-year federal moratorium on
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research, beginning with the act of the production of
<br>
cloned human embryos.
<br>
<p>We argued for this moratorium on a number of grounds. It would provide more
<br>
time to debate whether we should cross this crucial moral boundary--that of
<br>
creating human life solely as a resource for research. A moratorium would
<br>
allow time for other areas of stem cell research, both adult and embryonic,
<br>
to proceed. It would allow time for those who believe that
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research can never ethically be pursued to make their
<br>
case, and for those who disagree to design a responsible system of
<br>
regulation and public oversight.
<br>
<p>A national moratorium would also allow the debate on the question of
<br>
research on cloned embryos to be taken up in the larger context, where it
<br>
belongs, the context of embryo research generally, and of the future
<br>
possibilities of genetic engineering of human life. Pending such debate, the
<br>
majority of the council held that no law should now be enacted that approves
<br>
or authorizes any human cloning.
<br>
<p>With the Senate, now in recess, having failed to act on the cloning
<br>
legislation, we find these questions still before us and likely to return
<br>
for legislative consideration. Yet, even as we speak, Italian embryologist
<br>
Severino Antinori claims that a clonal pregnancy is in the works and that
<br>
the first cloned child may be born soon.
<br>
<p>I think it behooves us as human beings and citizens to step forward and urge
<br>
our legislative representatives to act when they next convene, and to
<br>
continue to think about the deepest human and social implications of the
<br>
biotechnology revolution now underway.

<p>Slavery plus Abortion
<br>
Diana Schaub
<br>
<p>On the cover of Human Cloning and Human Dignity: The Report of the
<br>
President's Council on Bioethics is the image of a fingerprint. It's an
<br>
inspired choice, for the fingerprint, as Leon Kass's &quot;Foreword&quot; says, &quot;has
<br>
rich biological and moral significance.&quot; The fingerprint is at once
<br>
emblematic of our common humanity and our individual uniqueness. No two are
<br>
alike; even identical twins have distinct fingerprints. Presumably a cloned
<br>
human being also, as a sort of delayed-entry twin, would not be a perfect
<br>
repeat, at least not all the way down to the tips of her fingers. DNA is not
<br>
the whole of our nature. It is, however, a good deal of it, and the question
<br>
raised by recent scientific developments is whether and how much we ought to
<br>
stick our fingers in it. Ought we to put our own impress upon the means by
<br>
which human beings come to be? As Kass points out, fingerprints are the
<br>
marks left by our grasp on things--a grasp that is sometimes illicit. This
<br>
is why the police know as much about fingerprints as scientists do. And it
<br>
is why the decisions to be made about cloning are properly political
<br>
decisions. It belongs to citizens and legislators to police the bounds of
<br>
the human grasp, to determine what may be manipulated, manhandled, and
<br>
doctored, and in what ways. While the liberty of the mind is by right
<br>
absolute, actions may, with justification, be restricted or forbidden.
<br>
<p>Let me suggest another metaphoric image that came to mind while reading the
<br>
report: not the fingerprint but the navel and especially the exercise
<br>
referred to as &quot;contemplating your navel.&quot; Now before anyone mistakes this
<br>
for a criticism, uncivilly expressed, let me hasten to say that I am using
<br>
the expression rather unidiomatically. &quot;Contemplating your navel&quot; usually
<br>
means to relax and withdraw from the world, to zone out, waste time, and
<br>
daydream. I don't mean that. I mean that the council has meditated on the
<br>
human core and that it has deepened our self-understanding by reflecting on
<br>
matters often overlooked. In Brave New World, the inhabitants of the World
<br>
State are &quot;hatched&quot; and &quot;decanted&quot; rather than born; I surmise that Huxley's
<br>
Betas, Deltas, and Epsilons, manufactured in uniform batches by
<br>
&quot;Bokanovsky's process,&quot; are entirely without bellybuttons. So, while we
<br>
still have them, we might do well to contemplate them.
<br>
<p>In effect, that is what the council's report does. It explores the meaning
<br>
of procreation and the human significance of sexual reproduction. It
<br>
articulates the links between sexual reproduction and the ground and purpose
<br>
of the human family, the continuity of the generations, the formation of
<br>
individual identity, and the bearing of our freedom and our mortality. The
<br>
report enables us to understand all that is at stake in the advent of
<br>
asexual reproduction. Cloning is a form of generation that would confound
<br>
the generations--a woman who had herself cloned would be both mother and
<br>
identical twin sister to her clone. She would in effect have become the
<br>
mother of herself. To aim to be the mother of oneself is the height of
<br>
hubris and despotism. It is the crime of incest--the begetting of one's own
<br>
upon one's own--scientifically perfected. The cloning of human beings would
<br>
be the triumph of the Machiavellian project to conquer fortune and bring
<br>
everything within the power of human choice and calculation.
<br>
<p>By raising serious doubts about that modern project, Human Cloning and Human
<br>
Dignity offers a vindication of the element of chance in human life. It
<br>
shows how human dignity is bound up with the lottery of nature and how the
<br>
ground of human dignity could be imperiled by the attempt to extend human
<br>
control over the human essence. The counsel of wisdom and prudence is to
<br>
stick with our old-fashioned, erotic, and happy-go-lucky mode of generation
<br>
rather than embracing the new science of solitary self-genesis. We should
<br>
remain true to the bellybutton--the bellybutton that reminds us of our
<br>
indebtedness to our origins, but that also bespeaks our directedness toward
<br>
a self-standing existence.
<br>
<p>In its combination of profound reflection on human nature with immediate
<br>
policy concerns and decisions, the council's report is reminiscent of The
<br>
Federalist Papers, a work which Jefferson--himself no Federalist--judged to
<br>
be &quot;the best commentary on the principles of government, which ever was
<br>
written.&quot; I predict a similar authoritative status for this publication in
<br>
the sphere of bioethics. In a sense, the council's report is even more
<br>
remarkable than The Federalist Papers, inasmuch as The Federalist Papers had
<br>
a partisan, and even propagandistic, purpose. Imagine if we instead had a
<br>
document called The Constitution Papers, a joint product of Federalists and
<br>
Anti-Federalists, laying out for the citizenry the full panoply of argument
<br>
and counter-argument. That is what this report is like. Even when it gives
<br>
expression to the council's unanimous opposition to
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children, it details the arguments that might be mustered
<br>
in support of such cloning. More especially when the topic is
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research, where the council was itself split, the
<br>
report, with a united voice, carefully delineates both the majority and
<br>
minority views, and seeks to bring them into conversation with one another.
<br>
This dialectical approach is so rare one hardly knows how to respond.
<br>
<p>Certainly, one comes away with new respect for the potential of reasoned
<br>
discourse within a democracy. Moreover, I at least came away with the
<br>
conviction that if one were, with an open mind, to read the whole of the
<br>
book, including the appendix of personal statements, one would be persuaded
<br>
of the rightness of banning all human cloning, whether for the purpose of
<br>
children or research. In the pageant of arguments, some of them looked
<br>
distinctly thin and weak. And yet, dampening one's hope that truth will
<br>
emerge the winner is the fact that the participants themselves, despite
<br>
their respectful listening to one another, did not achieve agreement. Well,
<br>
they did and they didn't. On the question of cloning-to-produce-children,
<br>
there was welcome unanimity. However, on the question of
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research, there was a deadlock, with seven members
<br>
for permitting it, seven for banning it, and three in the middle in favor of
<br>
a moratorium. For the rest of my time, I would like to talk about the
<br>
meaning of that deadlock and what it portends for the future.
<br>
<p>In the end, the seven in favor of a permanent ban were willing to join with
<br>
the three in favor of a temporary ban in order to produce a majority
<br>
recommending a moratorium. From what we have seen so far in Congress, the
<br>
deadlock is being repeated there, though with less prospect of a policy
<br>
compromise emerging. Indeed, the deadlock over
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research may make any sort of legislative action
<br>
unlikely, even a ban on cloning-to-produce-children (despite the near
<br>
universal opposition to such cloning). The division over
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research is a division not so much over cloning as
<br>
over the status of the human embryo, cloned or not. Until that larger
<br>
issue--with its implications for embryo research in general, as well as for
<br>
the current practice of in vitro fertilization, and of course for
<br>
abortion--is resolved, we risk ending up with a laissez-faire policy on
<br>
cloning that very few Americans want.
<br>
<p>I did find it tremendously heartening that the split within the council was
<br>
not between scientists and humanists. For instance, four of the six M.D.s
<br>
voted for the moratorium on research cloning, and in some cases clearly
<br>
favored strengthening that to a ban. It seemed, indeed, that those who knew
<br>
most about embryology spoke most persuasively about the unsustainability of
<br>
the claim that 14-day-old and younger embryos might be treated with less
<br>
than full human respect--because less than fully human. Stanford University
<br>
biologist William Hurlbut, for instance, both in his detailed responses on
<br>
the subjects of gastrulation and twinning, and in his general explanation of
<br>
potentiality and organismal unity, showed how the evidence of science
<br>
supports the claim that the early embryo has an inviolable moral status.
<br>
<p>Kass reminds us in the &quot;Foreword&quot; that &quot;reasonable and morally serious
<br>
people can differ about fundamental issues,&quot; but I take it that this unique
<br>
experiment in clarifying the differences is undertaken in the hope that such
<br>
clarification will lead to the concord of truth. In other words, this is not
<br>
a matter about which we can just agree to disagree. There is an imperative
<br>
to continue reasoning with one another, which implies, I think, that there
<br>
is reason with a capital R out there somewhere, and that reasonable people,
<br>
were they perfectly reasonable, or even just sufficiently reasonable to the
<br>
occasion, would arrive at it. As Lincoln said of the slavery controversy:
<br>
&quot;Whenever the issue can be distinctly made, and all extraneous matter thrown
<br>
out so that men can fairly see the real difference between the parties, this
<br>
controversy will soon be settled, and it will be done peaceably too.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, maybe the cloning controversy is not like the slavery controversy.
<br>
Certainly, there is no looming prospect of civil war should the division of
<br>
opinion continue. Kass suggests there is another difference as well. In the
<br>
&quot;Foreword,&quot; he says that with slavery or despotism, it is easy to identify
<br>
evil as evil, and the challenge is rather to figure out how best to combat
<br>
it. But in the realm of bioethics, the evils we face (if indeed they are
<br>
evils) are intertwined with the goods we so keenly seek: cures for disease,
<br>
relief of suffering, and preservation of life. When good and bad are so
<br>
intermixed, distinguishing between them is often extremely difficult. In
<br>
talking of the complexity and difficulty of the bioethical enterprise, Kass
<br>
was perhaps being diplomatic. This remark could be in the same vein as the
<br>
&quot;reasonable people can differ&quot; statement, inasmuch as it gives further
<br>
reason for why they might differ.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, with considerable trepidation, I feel I must take issue with
<br>
the statement. The trepidation arises because Leon Kass was my teacher at
<br>
the University of Chicago and because I believe the nation at large is now
<br>
blessed in having him as a teacher. At the risk both of seeming ungrateful,
<br>
and of being wrong, I would only point out that it was not at all easy to
<br>
bring men to see slavery as evil, particularly not once the practice of
<br>
slavery was well-established in the life of the nation. Moreover, in the
<br>
controversy over slavery, as Lincoln himself admitted, there were legitimate
<br>
goods at stake for the slaveholding South, among them security,
<br>
self-preservation and the preservation of their way of life, states' rights,
<br>
specific constitutional guarantees, and a certain kind of honor. Lincoln's
<br>
acknowledgement, however, of the weightiness of the South's legitimate
<br>
concerns didn't stop him from declaring slavery an evil and insisting that
<br>
one cannot attain those real human goods by the route of perpetuating
<br>
slavery. There is a difference between granting credence to the goods sought
<br>
by one's opponents and granting credence to their arguments or plans.
<br>
<p>We are armed now with this invaluable report, and so the time has come to
<br>
frame the issue more sharply. Cloning is an evil; and cloning for the
<br>
purpose of research actually exacerbates the evil by countenancing the
<br>
willful destruction of nascent human life. Moreover, it proposes doing this
<br>
on a mass scale, as an institutionalized and routinized undertaking to
<br>
extract medical benefits for those who have greater power. It is slavery
<br>
plus abortion.
<br>
<p>Of my teacher I would ask: Is it either incorrect or misleading or unhelpful
<br>
to see the dispute over cloning as of a piece with the slavery crisis and
<br>
the abortion debate? And further, if the example of Lincoln is pertinent,
<br>
then does talk of moral complexity and the intertwinedness of good and evil
<br>
and the intractability of the issues make it harder to identify evil as evil
<br>
and more likely that we will end up in Brave New World, where despotism
<br>
masquerades as a conception of the good? The motto of the World State with
<br>
which Huxley's novel opens is &quot;community, identity, stability.&quot; I suspect
<br>
our own path to biomedical despotism will be guided by the words &quot;progress,
<br>
compassion, and choice.&quot;

<br>
<p>An Opportunity Lost
<br>
Charles Murray
<br>
<p>It is customary when making critical remarks to start out by saying nice
<br>
things about the person one is criticizing, and I want to do that now, but
<br>
not pro forma. The report of the President's Council on Bioethics is superb.
<br>
It embodies the kind of reasoned discourse that you wish were used for all
<br>
public issues and almost never is. Furthermore, Leon Kass was the best
<br>
possible person to head up this effort. I can think of no one else who
<br>
brings to this difficult subject such moral seriousness, power of intellect,
<br>
and generosity of spirit.
<br>
<p>It is then a wonderful document, but also I believe profoundly misguided.
<br>
Here is how I wish the report had begun: As students of the history of
<br>
science, we understand that it is not within our power or the power of the
<br>
United States to have one iota of effect on what is going to happen with
<br>
human cloning. This technology will develop at its own pace, and to an
<br>
extent that will be dictated by what can be done, not by what we wish would
<br>
be done.
<br>
<p>We understand the folly of trying to imitate King Canute. But we are also
<br>
students of the problems of being human and the problems of human
<br>
institutions. And we see in this arising technology ways in which these
<br>
institutions are placed at risk, especially that core institution of the
<br>
family. We see ways in which our understanding of what it means to be human
<br>
could easily be compromised in ways that would leave us spiritually poorer
<br>
and bereft of many of the sources of human fulfillment that we now enjoy.
<br>
<p>Therefore, our task is not to propose new regulations or laws, for we
<br>
understand their futility, but to engage in dialogue with those who are
<br>
doing this research so that we may manage it with as little harm and as much
<br>
good as possible. That is what I wish the council's report had said.
<br>
<p>It is simply not serious to think that the U.S. government can pronounce on
<br>
what is going to happen with this technology. It can't. In no past instance
<br>
has anybody been able to put a lid on scientific inquiry and its progress,
<br>
and we won't this time, especially because biotechnology is so attractive to
<br>
so many people.
<br>
<p>If in 1939, when we already had the physics for the atom bomb, we didn't yet
<br>
have a Hitler, it is quite possible that many physicists would have said,
<br>
&quot;Take this cup from our lips. We don't want to spend the next five years
<br>
building an atom bomb.&quot; Yet biotechnology is different. The scientists in
<br>
the field do not see themselves as engaged in the work of the devil; they
<br>
see themselves as bringing incalculable benefits to mankind. They do not see
<br>
Leon Kass and other members of the President's Council as people who are
<br>
trying to hold back and ponder at greater lengths extremely difficult moral
<br>
questions. They see them as troglodytes.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, hundreds of billions of dollars are to be made in
<br>
biotechnology. If you take a group of scientists who think they are doing
<br>
the Lord's work (even if most of them are not religious) and if there are
<br>
hundreds of billions of dollars to be made, I promise you, it will happen.
<br>
It may not happen in the United States if we pass certain laws, but it will
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>In this respect, there are a variety of ways in which the council's report,
<br>
much as I admire its tone and spirit, represents a missed opportunity. For
<br>
once we realize that the development of this technology is inevitable, then
<br>
our approach becomes quite different from the council's. Most importantly,
<br>
we would take steps to make sure that the United States remains the center
<br>
of this research, that the top scientists in the world are socialized here,
<br>
and that the best graduate students come here to learn how to do it. At
<br>
least then the science would develop within an ethos of moral
<br>
responsibility. Such will not happen if the center of research is in China,
<br>
or if it is done under cover in Barbados.
<br>
<p>The council's report exacerbates a number of problems. First, it gets in the
<br>
way of a meaningful dialogue with the scientific community. My impression
<br>
from conversations with scientists is that the Jesse Helms syndrome has set
<br>
in, whereby if Helms favors a position, you can be sure that nobody in
<br>
academia will admit to supporting it. We now have a situation in which the
<br>
difficult moral issues posed by cloning are raised mainly by conservative
<br>
Republicans. This is bad. It makes it that much harder to gain the
<br>
sympathetic attention of the scientists who do the research.
<br>
<p>A second problem concerns the portability of this science. I said a few
<br>
minutes ago that China's laboratories will do the research if we don't. The
<br>
report largely ignores this issue, noting only that strict laws against
<br>
certain kinds of work have been passed in Michigan and in Germany, and yet
<br>
their biogenetic industries seem to be doing just fine. I'm sorry, but that
<br>
is not good enough.
<br>
<p>We are at the very early days of a very big business, and the portability of
<br>
science has increased enormously. You don't have to be on a Cal Tech campus
<br>
to consult with people at Cal Tech, nor within the continental limits of the
<br>
United States to interact with our scientists. The Internet has seen to
<br>
that. You don't need to be in a university setting in order to have the
<br>
state-of-the-art laboratories required for bioengineering. All you need is
<br>
money, and there is going to be lots of money for this kind of work. I am
<br>
not worried that many scientists would actually leave the United States to
<br>
engage in this research. What concerns me is that the United States will not
<br>
be at the center of a promising new technology, and that the scientists who
<br>
do the research will be socialized elsewhere.
<br>
<p>To continue this gloomy forecast, let me bring up a few additional topics
<br>
people just don't want to think about. I have already mentioned China.
<br>
Biotechnology within a fairly short period of time will open up all sorts of
<br>
possibilities; some of them are awful. I don't think China is going to blink
<br>
at any of them. While the use of this technology as a weapon is not nearly
<br>
as direct as the use of atomic energy as a weapon, we cannot overlook the
<br>
ways in which that could happen, too.
<br>
<p>I imagine that there are a variety of questions that people might reasonably
<br>
ask me, such as, &quot;Is this man completely indifferent to the question of
<br>
simply doing the right thing?&quot; No, I am not. I am probably as troubled by
<br>
this technology as Leon Kass. I may see more promise in the up side, but I
<br>
certainly am worried by the down side. However, when one is making moral
<br>
decisions not just for oneself but for large groups of people, a utilitarian
<br>
calculus must enter in. Moreover, if I am right in arguing that we cannot
<br>
stop the science from proceeding at least somewhere, then the council's
<br>
report amounts to an empty moral gesture.
<br>
<p>In the course of talking about these things, I have tended to sound more
<br>
apocalyptic than I really feel about the council's recommendations. A
<br>
four-year moratorium is in fact very modest. Great damage will not be done
<br>
to the position of the United States if this narrow recommendation is
<br>
adopted. My concern is rather for the increased probability of a wide
<br>
variety of things going wrong in the future.
<br>
<p>We are in the position of scientists in 1939. The science is in place. A
<br>
moral person can say that human beings should not have this technology. I am
<br>
willing to grant that if it were within our power to prevent human beings
<br>
from having this, there would be a good moral case for taking government
<br>
action. Yet if that cannot be done--and it cannot--one must face the fact
<br>
that human beings will have this capacity eventually. The question then is:
<br>
What can we do to minimize the damage and to enhance the benefits?
<br>
<p>In closing, let me say that one thing gives me comfort, and it is that on
<br>
the President's Council are a number of people, Leon Kass included, whose
<br>
intellect and judgment I respect enormously. That such men and women
<br>
disagree with me gives me some hope that I am wrong.

<br>
<p>The Danger of Absolutes
<br>
William A. Galston
<br>
<p>Despite my disagreement with some of its specific conclusions and
<br>
recommendations, I have come to praise the report of the President's Council
<br>
on Bioethics, not to bury it. The report is distinguished by an
<br>
extraordinary civility of tone, by which I mean not just mutually respectful
<br>
language among the council members but something more, a model of how
<br>
scholarly expertise can contribute to democratic deliberation and debate.
<br>
<p>The report offers--so far as the son of a biologist who is not himself a
<br>
biologist can judge--sound science, accessibly and impartially presented, in
<br>
the service of reflection on policy and morality, the sort of reflection in
<br>
which citizens and their representatives must engage. The contrast between
<br>
the council's report and the prevailing tone of our public discourse is
<br>
painful.
<br>
<p>Beyond this civility of tone is something that I will call civility of
<br>
substance. In this respect, I applaud as true what Diana Schaub condemned as
<br>
base. In the report, the proponents of the different positions do not argue
<br>
that all of the relevant reasons, principles, and human goods are on their
<br>
side. To say, as they do, that the balance or preponderance of goods point
<br>
in one direction, rather than another, is to give moral substance to the
<br>
view that others of good will and intelligence can legitimately arrive at
<br>
different conclusions. Indeed--and I think this is a very important
<br>
insight--the overall thrust of the report is that vitally important goods
<br>
and principles are not only at stake in the cloning debate but are also at
<br>
odds with one another. The choice is not so much between good and evil as
<br>
between good and good. As the report insists, &quot;Each side in the debate has
<br>
something vital to defend, not only for itself but for everyone.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet another reason that I admire the council's report is for the breadth of
<br>
the moral reflection in which it engages. Its inquiry is not conducted in
<br>
the spirit of cost-benefit utilitarianism or fashionable rights talk.
<br>
Instead, it emphasizes broad and deep reflection on what is good for human
<br>
beings, not only as individuals but as social beings imbedded in a network
<br>
of familial, social, and political relations. Furthermore, this report
<br>
offers not just the well-worn, though important and, indeed, unavoidable
<br>
debate about the status of the human embryo, but also innovative lines of
<br>
inquiry into the nature of good lives and of good societies.
<br>
<p>The council's report should also be praised for being quietly but boldly
<br>
counter-cultural. What do I mean by that? The report dares to suggest that
<br>
our characteristic American predilections and strengths--our orientation
<br>
toward life and freedom, innovation and compassion, and faith and
<br>
progress--which have brought us such blessings, can also be the source of
<br>
moral blindness and even hubris. It dares to suggest that on occasion there
<br>
are things more important than life--namely, in the old Aristotelian term
<br>
for these things, the good life. And it suggests that in the case of the
<br>
clash between lives and good lives, it's not always clear which way to go.
<br>
Even more counter-culturally, the report dares to suggest that there are
<br>
things even more important than the relief of suffering. This is an
<br>
amazingly bold proposition.
<br>
<p>To give you some idea of its daring, I quote from three widely separated
<br>
portions of the report. From the beginning: &quot;Easing suffering is not our
<br>
only moral obligation.&quot; From the middle: &quot;Suffering should not be opposed by
<br>
any means possible.&quot; And, toward the end, the report candidly states that if
<br>
a moratorium on cloning for biomedical research is enacted, &quot;It is possible
<br>
that some might suffer in the future because research proceeded more slowly.
<br>
We cannot suppose that the moral life comes without cost.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another thing I admire about the council's report is its scrambling of
<br>
conventional ideological categories. For example, I note with interest that
<br>
two of the best-known conservatives on the council, Charles Krauthammer and
<br>
James Q. Wilson, disagree with many other conservatives (while agreeing with
<br>
one another) in denying the human embryo the status of full personhood. They
<br>
nonetheless manage to disagree with one another concerning the most
<br>
contested policy issue before the council, namely
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research. I cannot imagine a more instructive lesson
<br>
in what I will approvingly call anti-dogmatism.
<br>
<p>Let me also note a very important feature of the language of this
<br>
report--that it is moral but not theological. For while various members of
<br>
the council are well known for their religious views, and while the council
<br>
as a body insists that religion has a valid and important role to play in
<br>
the public square, the report is remarkable for what appears to be its
<br>
deliberate effort to find a public language accessible to individuals of
<br>
differing faiths or of no faith at all. There is no reference to specific
<br>
doctrinal or theological positions and, perhaps with a single exception, no
<br>
mention of God.
<br>
<p>Having praised the report in due measure, I turn now to the second part of
<br>
my remarks, which consists of four mild criticisms and a concluding partisan
<br>
jab. My first mild criticism is that in the report's moral language I find
<br>
two discernibly different and conflicting moral traditions represented.
<br>
<p>One, which can be traced back to Aristotle, imagines a moral universe in
<br>
which there is a multiplicity of human and social goods, and argues for
<br>
balance and prudential deliberation to establish what is most important and
<br>
needful with regard to particular issues and situations. The second
<br>
tradition, which can be traced to Kant, focuses on human dignity and respect
<br>
and yields moral principles that are true, or held to be true,
<br>
categorically, without exception. Frequently, these principles consist in
<br>
absolute prohibitions of certain kinds of conduct, whatever the consequences
<br>
of adhering to the prohibition may be. But are these two moral traditions
<br>
compatible? Do they lead to the same kind of moral analysis or to the same
<br>
conclusions? And what happens when they don't?
<br>
<p>To bring this analysis down to earth, let me offer an example. In a
<br>
remarkable passage of the report, the council, which unanimously opposed
<br>
what is commonly known as reproductive cloning, states, &quot;We are willing to
<br>
grant that there may be exceptional cases in which
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children is morally defensible.&quot; The council then states,
<br>
&quot;Such cases do not justify the harmful experiments and social problems that
<br>
might be entailed by engaging in human cloning. Hard cases make bad law.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is easy to defend a legislative ban on cloning on the basis of an
<br>
absolute moral prohibition, assuming one exists. It becomes harder, however,
<br>
to defend an absolute legislative ban when the underlying morality, though
<br>
inclining strongly in one direction, is less than absolute. The council
<br>
wants to combine an Aristotelian stance toward prudential judgments with a
<br>
Kantian stance on blanket prohibitions. It is not clear that the two can be
<br>
brought together coherently.
<br>
<p>The council's report asks whether discovering new cures for the sick is &quot;a
<br>
moral imperative that should trump all other goods and values.&quot; That's a
<br>
good question. Along with the authors, I believe that the answer is no. But
<br>
I must then ask, is there any moral imperative that should trump all other
<br>
goods and values in all circumstances? My answer to that wider qustion is
<br>
also no. Would the council's majority agree with me?
<br>
<p>Second mild criticism: I must note one point on which I disagree with the
<br>
entire council. The report asserts at one point that if society accepts,
<br>
that is, fails to prohibit, a practice, then society may be said not only to
<br>
endorse but to engage in that practice. I think that that is just plain
<br>
wrong. In a liberal democratic polity with a limited government marked by
<br>
multiple sources of legitimate authority, public law will of necessity
<br>
permit many individual, associational, and religious practices that it
<br>
cannot be said to endorse, let alone to participate in. To think otherwise
<br>
is implicitly to affirm a conception of public authority as all responsible
<br>
and all powerful. I cannot imagine that the council really means to say
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Now for the third mild criticism. The report distinguishes between two
<br>
understandings of parents' relations to their children: that of children as
<br>
gifts and blessings who we learn to accept as gratefully as we can; and that
<br>
of children as products of our wills whom we try to shape in accordance with
<br>
our desires. The council's report unequivocally endorses the first
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>I don't think it's so simple. Much of parenting is a matter of striking a
<br>
difficult balance between shaping, on the one hand, and accepting, on the
<br>
other. I don't think we are morally obliged to refrain from, let us say,
<br>
prenatal genetic therapy to remedy defects in fetuses, which medical science
<br>
now enables us to do. We do not have to learn gratefully to accept those
<br>
defects if we can do something morally permissible to remedy them. I think
<br>
the council, in its understandable desire to chasten our tendency toward
<br>
scientific hubris, leans too far in the direction of a kind of principled
<br>
passivity that contradicts its quest for moral balance.
<br>
<p>Fourth, let me offer some reflections on the role of moral sentiments.
<br>
Taking their bearings from James Q. Wilson, the council members who favor
<br>
regulated cloning for the purpose of biomedical research argue that our
<br>
moral sentiments point toward a distinction between young embryos and
<br>
infants. This distinction is expressed, for example, in the different
<br>
levels, kinds, and durations of our mourning when catastrophe befalls one or
<br>
the other.
<br>
<p>Wilson asks rhetorically, &quot;Do we assign the same moral blame to harvesting
<br>
organs from a newborn infant and from a seven-day-old blastocyst?&quot; A
<br>
majority of the American people clearly would not. The question then
<br>
becomes, what is the moral force of our instinctive or natural responses to
<br>
morally latent phenomena? The council's majority argues that we must shape,
<br>
or in this case reshape, our emotional responses in light of our moral
<br>
obligations as revealed by reason. That is true, as far as it goes. But we
<br>
must go on to investigate the role that moral sentiments ought to play in
<br>
defining the content of our rational obligations. This is a question on
<br>
which the chairman of the council, who has written a famous article entitled
<br>
&quot;The Wisdom of Repugnance,&quot; is especially well qualified to shed some
<br>
additional light.
<br>
<p>Finally, the partisan jab. The council's majority declares, &quot;How we respond
<br>
to the weakest among us, to those who are nowhere near the zenith of human
<br>
flourishing, says much about our willingness to envision the boundaries of
<br>
humanity expansively and inclusively. It challenges the depth of our
<br>
commitment to equality.&quot; Hubert Humphrey couldn't have put it better. This
<br>
proposition, which the council puts forward as a truth not confined to the
<br>
question of cloning, leads in the direction of a robust social policy
<br>
oriented toward the most vulnerable in our society. I'm not confident that
<br>
the conservative readers of this report, who will tend to applaud the thrust
<br>
of its majority conclusions on the matter at hand, will be willing to accept
<br>
the broader implications of its animating principles.

<br>
<p>The Horror
<br>
J. Bottum
<br>
<p>There are three directions in which we might take a discussion of the report
<br>
of the President's Council on Bioethics. We might first talk about the issue
<br>
of cloning itself. Then again, we might turn to the deliberations of the
<br>
President's Council, as presented in this book, and talk about the divisions
<br>
and insights of the council's members. Finally, we might take this
<br>
discussion to be about politics--which is to say, the impact and the
<br>
importance, in the real world, of the policy recommendations made by the
<br>
President's Council. About all three of these, I have enormous amounts to
<br>
say--more than could ever be fit into the time we have. But here are a few
<br>
first thoughts.
<br>
<p>Among the finest features of the report is the perfect civility of its
<br>
thoughtful deliberations. And yet, that civility comes at a cost, which I am
<br>
not sure we have fully reckoned. While I applaud nearly all of its work, the
<br>
council's report does not, for example, sufficiently express the horror and
<br>
repugnance that the idea of cloning arouses in me.
<br>
<p>Perhaps an analogy will help make that feeling clear. I once tried to write
<br>
a poem about an attractive young woman I had seen walking along the street.
<br>
I suppose she was not beautiful, per se, but then I have reached the age at
<br>
which youth itself begins to seem beautiful. Those of you who are still
<br>
young may not understand what I am talking about. But for those of us
<br>
growing old, there is a lure in youthfulness--the tautness of it, the glow.
<br>
<p>And there is also a crime: to act upon that lure, to seek one's own youth
<br>
restored by leeching on the youthfulness of others. This is the mockable
<br>
widower seeking a young bride in Molière's comedies; it is the sexual
<br>
sickness expressed by Charles Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby when the aged
<br>
Arthur Gride drools over the young Madeleine after using her father's debts
<br>
to force her into his power.
<br>
<p>But I have in mind something more than putting an armful of warm girl in an
<br>
old man's cold bed. Behind this stands the fantasy of age, that would
<br>
sacrifice the young to buy its way back from the aches and diseases that age
<br>
is prone to. There is, for instance, the old witch who wants to fatten up
<br>
Hansel and Gretel before she bakes them in her oven and devours their youth.
<br>
And then there is Elizabeth Bathory--the seventeenth-century Hungarian
<br>
countess and perhaps the most famous figure to come out of Transylvania
<br>
since Vlad the Impaler. Her trial records estimate that she slaughtered 600
<br>
young virgins in a decade, in order to bathe in their youth-restoring blood.
<br>
<p>Let me bring this analogy home. It seems to me that the proponents of much
<br>
of the biotech revolution--the supporters and enablers of the Brave New
<br>
World of eugenic biotechnology--are forced into the uncomfortable position
<br>
of insisting that the Countess Bathory was absolutely right, at least about
<br>
her goals. She merely chose the wrong means.
<br>
<p>I mean that not quite in the provocative sense in which I phrased it. She
<br>
was obviously wrong about the effects of virgins' blood, and she lacked the
<br>
help of Advanced Cell Technology's laboratories in Massachusetts. But she
<br>
also chose the wrong means when she used living, conscious human beings. The
<br>
proponents of cloning-for-biomedical-research insist that the objects upon
<br>
which modern laboratories work are not living human beings but cells--or
<br>
biological accidents, or bits of human beings--which, because of ancient
<br>
prejudices, must be spoken of in reverential ways, but which need not be
<br>
treated any differently than a fingernail clipping or, in that great
<br>
euphemism of abortionists, &quot;the product of conception.&quot;
<br>
<p>But I want to think about this in terms of human motivation. Indeed, when
<br>
the President's Council distinguishes &quot;cloning-for-biomedical-research&quot; from
<br>
&quot;cloning-to-produce-children,&quot; it invites us to notice that the primary
<br>
distinction between them is, in fact, a matter of human motivation--namely,
<br>
the purpose for which the biotechnologist created the clone.
<br>
<p>Much has been made, by Francis Fukuyama and others, about the recent efforts
<br>
of scientists to complete the Baconian project--the great vision of Francis
<br>
Bacon that science will finally ameliorate the human condition, so that we
<br>
will all be happy, diseaseless, and nigh on immortal. I think it is right to
<br>
notice this impending fulfillment of the promise that Bacon made centuries
<br>
ago. But there is something else to notice as well--namely, that Bacon
<br>
required for his dream that we dismiss all notion of purpose and goal for
<br>
the objects of science. Indeed, Bacon's New Organon is filled with attacks
<br>
upon the Aristotelian idea of final causation, a natural purpose or aim for
<br>
things.
<br>
<p>But goals don't actually go away just because we want them to. In the space
<br>
opened up by the dismissal of final cause from science, there entered the
<br>
malleability of things to the human will. We give things their purpose; we
<br>
give them their final cause. The human act is conceived to be the only thing
<br>
in the universe that has motive, purpose, goal, or aim--and those motives
<br>
will eventually eat up the reality of everything else.
<br>
<p>In fact, they have already eaten up reality. There are serious political
<br>
questions that might be raised about the council's report. But think about
<br>
this: The council was unanimous in wanting to prohibit forever
<br>
cloning-to-produce-children, and could only by the barest majority reach the
<br>
compromise of a temporary moratorium on cloning-for-biomedical-research.
<br>
This seems to me exactly backwards. However much cloning-to-produce-children
<br>
proceeds along defective means, it still aims at the natural cause of
<br>
procreation. It wants to make babies.
<br>
<p>Cloning-for-biomedical-research, on the other hand, has abandoned the goal.
<br>
Embryos, fetuses, blastocysts, activated eggs, products of SCNT, whatever
<br>
euphemism is floating around this week--cloning-for-biomedical-research
<br>
takes those objects and makes them plastic playthings for the human will.
<br>
What is worse, it is the human will traveling down a line of motivation that
<br>
is inherently suspect--if we remember Molière, and Dickens, and the old, old
<br>
stories. We are becoming the people that, once upon a time, our ancestors
<br>
used fairy tales to warn their children against.
<br>
<p>Now, Francis Bacon's scientific vision of modernity is not the only one.
<br>
There is also a literary vision of modernity. And from Mary Shelley's
<br>
Frankenstein to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, the literary imagination
<br>
has not pictured the prospect of manufactured human beings with much joy.
<br>
<em>&gt;From Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to H. G. Wells' The
</em><br>
Island of Dr. Moreau, the literary imagination has not been much taken with
<br>
scientists who manipulate the deep things of life just because they can.
<br>
<p>The truth is, after reading these authors, I worry about people who reach
<br>
into the stuff of life and twist it to their will. I worry about people who
<br>
act simply because they can. If they lived in crumbling castles--their hair
<br>
standing up on end and their voices howling in maniacal laughter--we'd know
<br>
them to be mad scientists. But they wear nice white lab coats, and their
<br>
pleasant-looking chief executive appears on television to assure us that
<br>
they are really acting for the best of medical motives and, besides, there
<br>
is a great deal of money to made in biotech and pharmaceutical stocks.
<br>
<p>Sometimes the disingenuousness is unbearable. Evading the regulations in
<br>
France, the French company Clonaid recently opened a laboratory in Ivory
<br>
Coast, and its spokeswoman announced that they had done so in response to
<br>
the great demand for cloning in sub-Saharan Africa. Ah, yes, my wife
<br>
suggested: Those poor, starving Africans, desperate for food, drinking
<br>
water, and the latest fads in biotechnology.
<br>
<p>But Clonaid's move to Africa seems to me a final proof of the dangerousness
<br>
of unlimited human will. The people who say that this technology can be
<br>
regulated are simply ignorant of human nature. If you were to put up a lever
<br>
with a sign that said, &quot;Don't touch or the world will be destroyed,&quot; the
<br>
paint wouldn't even be dry before someone's last words were, &quot;I just wanted
<br>
to see what would happen.&quot;
<br>
<p>We have to applaud the seriousness that Leon Kass has brought to Washington,
<br>
the tone and tenor of the deliberations, and the report that issued from the
<br>
President's Council on Bioethics. But I think we must also raise questions
<br>
about the civility that is the report's finest feature.

Leon R. Kass
<br>
<p>These were deeply searching, very thoughtful, very well-considered comments.
<br>
I regard these remarks from the four of you as an enormous gift to our
<br>
enterprise.
<br>
<p>One way to join comments made by Diana Schaub, Charles Murray, and Bill
<br>
Galston is to raise a question. Bill Galston raised it very nicely when he
<br>
asked whether we are dealing in a moral realm of prudence or in one of
<br>
absolutes and categorical imperatives. Are we in a realm without inflexible
<br>
&quot;Thou shalt nots&quot; or are we in one where there really are abominations like
<br>
slavery? If we are dealing with moral abominations, then to say &quot;on the one
<br>
hand, on the other&quot; is, as Jody Bottum suggests, to lend countenance and
<br>
cover to genuine evil. The report's ambiguity on this question is not solely
<br>
due to the chairman's uncertainty but is I think a genuine perplexity. Is
<br>
cloning human embryos for research really like slavery?
<br>
<p>The people who have argued against abortion have also drawn an analogy to
<br>
slavery, the difference being that the youngest amongst us don't look enough
<br>
like us to gain our empathy. Without lawyers and unable to speak for
<br>
themselves, unborn children do not gain our support, and the evil
<br>
perpetrated against them is too easily overlooked. In this view, there can
<br>
be no compromise with a deep violation of principle, no matter how noble the
<br>
end. On the other hand, if we really are in the situation of choosing
<br>
between competing goods, as Bill Galston suggests, then it is a question of
<br>
calculation, presumably in the name of not just safety and efficacy but
<br>
larger things. This is the realm of prudence, not principle.
<br>
<p>I go back and forth on this. It does seem to me that the moral life has to
<br>
be lived somehow as a combination of principle and prudence. There must be
<br>
some boundary conditions of &quot;Thou shalt nots.&quot; And only thanks to the fact
<br>
that there are certain firm and nonnegotiable limits do we have a safe moral
<br>
realm in which prudence can govern.
<br>
<p>I am inclined to say that creating nascent life for the sole purpose of
<br>
exploitation and research involving its necessary destruction would
<br>
transgress a moral boundary of that indispensable sort. However, though I am
<br>
sympathetic to the arguments of Jody Bottum and Diana Schaub, and despite
<br>
the fact that I regard the embryo as somehow mysterious, I don't believe
<br>
that it is fully &quot;one of us&quot; (here I speak for myself, not for the council
<br>
as a whole). The challenge that James Q. Wilson posed is a good one. We do
<br>
not treat the demise of the five-day-old embryo as we do the death of a
<br>
child, and we don't react with the same kind of horror--though maybe we
<br>
should--at the dismemberment of 100 cells for the sake of saving lives as we
<br>
would if we killed a two-year-old child to remove his kidneys so another
<br>
child might be saved.
<br>
<p>Yet it may very well be that such moral sentiments are a poor guide here. So
<br>
let me shift to that question and take it up directly. I think repugnance is
<br>
not an absolutely firm guide in these matters, but it is a warning. The
<br>
deepest things especially are very hard to capture in precise and rational
<br>
speech. We cannot rationally articulate the horror that is father-daughter
<br>
incest. If we tried to make the argument, we would imperil our conviction
<br>
that this is an abomination. I don't think we can fully make an argument as
<br>
to what is wrong with rape or murder or cannibalism. Our revulsion at these
<br>
things is a guide that we are defending something that runs very deep.
<br>
Argument can come to our aid, especially in a culture where the endless
<br>
chatter of self-styled &quot;rationalists&quot; tends to undermine our intuitions
<br>
about these things.
<br>
<p>And if one lives in an age without a shared sense of what is seemly and what
<br>
is abominable, and everything is up for grabs, perhaps nothing is left but
<br>
to get Jody Bottum out on the political stump. But public discourse cannot,
<br>
I think, conduct itself on the basis of Jody's unique rhetorical and
<br>
prophetic brilliance.
<br>
<p>So where are we? There is no denying that the questions about
<br>
cloning-for-biomedical-research are in a way bound up with the abortion
<br>
controversy. Jody Bottum argues that it is far worse to create nascent human
<br>
life to destroy it for the use of the living than it is to start down the
<br>
road of baby manufacture and working our will on living children. I am not
<br>
sure about that. It seems to me that death and destruction--horrible though
<br>
they be--are old matters. What is really new is not the immorality of the
<br>
means that we use to gain our new powers but the things that these new
<br>
powers make possible. In the future, we will be able to work our will upon
<br>
untold future generations to turn them into creatures after our own image.
<br>
That I think is really something novel and worth arguing about, independent
<br>
of the question of the destruction of nascent life.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, though I cannot believe that destroying an embryo is
<br>
tantamount to murder, I am always impressed with the people who bear witness
<br>
on this subject--even if they are going to lose in the end. They have a deep
<br>
reverence for what our humanity is in its earliest form and have risen to
<br>
defend it. I can't persuade myself that they are not right.
<br>
<p>But to respond briefly to Diana Schaub, nor can I persuade myself that
<br>
cloning is akin to slavery. Yes, new lives would be created, and on a mass
<br>
scale, purely to serve other people's purposes. And, yes, such innocent,
<br>
nascent lives would be willfully exploited and destroyed. And I even agree
<br>
with Diana Schaub that the path to biomedical despotism and degradation can
<br>
be guided by the words &quot;progress, compassion, and choice.&quot; But I am not
<br>
sufficiently confident about the ontological or moral status of a
<br>
five-day-old embryo to speak in such abolitionist terms. At the same time,
<br>
however, I am inclined to give the embryo the benefit of the doubt, refusing
<br>
to corrupt myself into thinking that we can use with impunity the seeds of
<br>
the next generation to save our own. Otherwise we will have hardened our
<br>
hearts, becoming incapable of resisting when the compassionate healers want
<br>
the boundary of permissible exploitation moved from five days to five weeks
<br>
or even five months.
<br>
<p>In the view of Charles Murray, the council's enterprise is futile. But my
<br>
interest in the subject of cloning goes beyond whether or not we should
<br>
engage in it. My interest is also in whether human beings through their
<br>
political institutions can exercise at least some control over where
<br>
biotechnology is taking us. Cloning is an occasion to see whether the
<br>
community can exercise the will and discipline to make its moral voice
<br>
heard, and to be a teacher of what can and can't be allowed.
<br>
<p>Cloning-for-biomedical-research has, alas, confounded the question, for it
<br>
is really a small piece of embryo research in general. We should be arguing
<br>
about cloning-for-biomedical-research in the context of all embryo research.
<br>
Certainly, it would be no victory for the pro-life movement to ban the
<br>
creation of cloned embryos for research, while allowing the creation of
<br>
embryos for research by in vitro fertilization in the private sector to
<br>
continue without any limits.
<br>
<p>So let's just talk about cloning for baby-making. This is an opportunity to
<br>
shift the burden of proof from the opponents to the proponents of cloning,
<br>
to those who would challenge what makes us human. Let's say to the people
<br>
who want to produce cloned children, &quot;Show us why this is a necessity.&quot; The
<br>
proponents have the obligation to explain why this is not just a whim but
<br>
something society should countenance. A legislative ban in this country
<br>
would shift the burden of proof, even if, in fact, there are renegade
<br>
scientists elsewhere in the world who would practice it.
<br>
<p>Charles Murray may be right that an opportunity to engage the scientific
<br>
community was missed. Perhaps we should follow the British model and
<br>
directly involve the biotech companies and their scientists, and design some
<br>
kind of regulatory scheme. We could set a boundary of seven or ten days
<br>
beyond which embryo research would not be allowed. We would let the
<br>
scientists do some things that may make us uncomfortable in the hope that
<br>
the worst disasters could be prevented.
<br>
<p>Yet such prudential boundary lines will always be moveable. Today, the focus
<br>
is on stem cells. Five years from now we may discover that by putting these
<br>
little embryos into a pig uterus and growing them to two months, their
<br>
kidneys and primordial livers are even more valuable than the stem cells. We
<br>
will find that the line we have drawn around stem cells will not hold, and
<br>
we will live to regret our earlier desire to be &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot;
<br>
when crossing important moral boundaries.
<br>
<p>I am not quite so nihilistic as Charles Murray about the possibility of
<br>
effective intervention. True, there is little precedent for the control of
<br>
scientific progress. On the other hand, we have refused to allow the buying
<br>
and selling of organs for transplant, even though markets in organs would
<br>
yield more organs. This is a proscription that might not last, but it has
<br>
managed to hold, at least for the time being.
<br>
<p>Many nations have enacted bans on all cloning, and, in fact, there is a
<br>
convention under deliberation in the United Nations right now on whether to
<br>
ban cloning. The French and the Germans want to restrict the international
<br>
ban to cloning-to-produce-children only because they already have embryo
<br>
laws in place in their own nations. The United States is leading a coalition
<br>
to produce the kind of ban that President Bush favors. I don't see any
<br>
reason why we should shrink from this effort. Certainly, much of
<br>
biotechnology is wonderful, but the scientific community should understand
<br>
(and it is in its best interest to do so) that progress must proceed within
<br>
moral boundaries set by the norms of the international community.
<br>
<p>Moreover, it is simply not true that this research can't progress within
<br>
certain moral boundaries, providing that the boundaries are not too severe.
<br>
And it seems to me that the United States should be a leader in determining
<br>
what should and should not be done, rather than playing catch-up, as we have
<br>
been to this point.
<br>
<p>The United States is unlikely, unless we step forward in this matter, to
<br>
remain the center of ethical biotechnology. Yes, the Chinese might be less
<br>
restrictive, but because we are Americans, because we believe in progress,
<br>
and that if something can be done, it will be done, because we believe in
<br>
the freedom of entrepreneurs, of scientists, of users, because we believe in
<br>
compassionate humanitarianism--for all of these reasons, we will have a very
<br>
difficult time being the moral teacher of the world in these matters. The
<br>
fact is that the moral principles that govern us--life, liberty, and the
<br>
pursuit of happiness--are not sufficient to defend human dignity from
<br>
biotechnology's onslaught.
