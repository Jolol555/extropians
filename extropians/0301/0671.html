It raises some paradoxical questions as to how one can have a &quot;big impact&quot; 
<br>
if one doesn't have a &quot;name&quot; and how
<br>
one can have a &quot;name&quot; if someone hasn't invested in creating that and
<br>
how one can &quot;invest in creating a name&quot; if one doesn't skim funds from
<br>
what one knows are really unprofitable ventures in order to invest those
<br>
funds into &quot;name creation&quot;.
<br>
<p>Food for thought.

<br>
<p>It seems to me that after the book sells close to it's maximuim potential 
<br>
they might as well just allow it to be downloaded for free.
<br>
This would give larger interest base for people would likely purchase the 
<br>
book. Especially since the interest group is so small in comparison to the 
<br>
populace. Also with the some of the money generated you could have it 
<br>
translated and allow it to be downloaded for free to other countries. This 
<br>
seems to me the only way many non-super powers will probably get access to 
<br>
the book given thier income, language, and other barriers. This way wouldn't 
<br>
you be much more likely to get more people interested, make more of a name 
<br>
for yourself, and generate more sales on further books? Also wouldn't each 
<br>
book support further interest in books like it creating generally more 
<br>
interest in fields like nanotechnology?
<br>
<p>Doesn't the whole creation of name in the first place lead to a very bias 
<br>
popular opinion? Wouldn't it be better to create a &quot;name&quot; of a group of 
<br>
people who have contradictory opinions. Then have these varios authors write 
<br>
about thier thoughts in one book. The whole pooling of thought seems to 
<br>
speed up that way. Instead of reading 12 different books you could read one 
<br>
which distinquishes each opinion in it. That way you don't have to reread 
<br>
them and look for discrepincies. Maybe this method will take off in the 
<br>
future and pools of 100 or even 1000 authors come together to write one 
<br>
book. Books would become extremely specific instead of talking about 
<br>
evolution in one stage they talk about the cause of one gene mutation but 
<br>
offer 100 different opinions.
<br>
What do you think?
