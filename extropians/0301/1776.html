<br>
What I have always wondered about is a Kantian take on                        
<br>
all this: what if everyone took to the streets to make                        
<br>
their voices and views on issues heard?  What if all                          
<br>
the racists in the U.S., for example, marched to support                      
<br>
their right to their own beliefs?                                             
<br>
<p><p>It would be a very colorful and newsworthy weekend. Not *everyone* would
<br>
be out on the streets, since some people lack clearly defined beliefs... I
<br>
suppose they would compose the crowds of onlookers. Some individuals probably
<br>
believe that the best way they can further their goals is by doing exactly
<br>
what they're already doing, so they'd go to work as normal and work in
<br>
blissfully empty offices, labs, and workshops (ignoring the chanting and
<br>
bullhorns from outside). The cops and National Guard would for the most part
<br>
best serve their beliefs by policing the demonstration, sometimes policing it
<br>
very &quot;actively&quot; shall we say.
<br>
<p>After a few days of this holiday-come-riot, everyone would end up detained,
<br>
hospitalized, or hungry and thirsty (since the shopkeepers would presumably
<br>
also mostly be out there demonstrating).
<br>
<p>People would eventually drift back to their jobs. It would probably make the
<br>
politicians take note of public opinion a little more, and the effects would
<br>
probably last for a year or two. Since corporations aren't *really* people
<br>
and don't have beliefs, they would be the big losers in this event-- they
<br>
wouldn't get to promote their memes. Other big losers would be groups that
<br>
are vocal out of proportion to their true levels of public support (such as
<br>
the Klan, the socialists, and the closet conservatives who pretend they're
<br>
anarcho-capitalists or some such). The government may get toppled, but given
<br>
that people still mostly have the deeply ingrained assumption that *someone*
<br>
needs to be in charge, another one will soon coalesce to take its place. There
<br>
is a 50% chance that the new one will be more inane, and a 50% chance that it
<br>
will be less so.
<br>
<p>We would all definitely think we knew which meme had the greatest numbers on
<br>
its side, and we probably would all continue to disagree with each other.
<br>
<p>I would obtain a videocam and tape the whole thing during occasional breaks
<br>
from the lab. I would do my best to convince the people I was taping that
<br>
getting naked on camera would maximize the spread of their pet memes.
<br>
<p>Kantian question answered.
