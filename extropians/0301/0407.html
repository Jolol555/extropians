<p>### Most people with severe deformities resent their disability (a fact). We
<br>
have to use probabilistic arguments about the child, and assume that she
<br>
will develop the common attitude, rather than her mother's idiosyncratic
<br>
distaste for limbs. Therefore, the Golden Rule (in the form of veil of
<br>
ignorance) demands that we act in the predicted interest of the child, and
<br>
stop/punish her mother.
