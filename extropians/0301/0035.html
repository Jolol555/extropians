<p>...and other people influenced by Borges

<br>
<p>begin quote:
<br>
Borges as an Influence 
<br>
<p>Borges has been cited by many writers as having an influence on their
<br>
works; but unlike many authors like Kafka or Joyce, the influence of
<br>
Borges is often more subtle to detect. In addition, since he is more
<br>
known for a certain flavor to his ideas about time and space than for a
<br>
particular narrative or stylistic invention, he has influenced many
<br>
writers of science fiction and fantasy as well as writers of more
<br>
&quot;mainstream&quot; fiction and literature.
<br>
<p>Below you will find a list of authors whom all make reference to or have
<br>
been influenced by Borges. I have divided it into two sections: a Main
<br>
Collection, and a Reader's Gallery. The Main Collection is broken down
<br>
into entries for individual authors -- clicking on their name will take
<br>
you to a small page that explains their work and highlights the
<br>
influence of Borges; where available I have tried to include direct
<br>
quotations and interview excerpts. These entries were either written by
<br>
me, or were submitted by kind readers. The Reader's Gallery contains
<br>
authors submitted to me by visitors, and here I have merely quoted the
<br>
text of the relevant letter and provided the sender's name and email
<br>
address. These entries are all smaller in size and largely undeveloped,
<br>
but some may be expanded in the future and added to the Main Collection.
<br>
If anyone wishes to develop one of these authors further for the Main
<br>
Collection, let me know!
<br>
