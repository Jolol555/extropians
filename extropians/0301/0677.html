<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike explains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The deist view is essentially that Natural Law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is Objective Truth, embedded in the structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and function of the universe, and exhibited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in our daily lives by much more than gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relativistic effects, but also biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evolution and the development of intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and individualistic generalist organisms such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh!  It suddenly dawns on me that you are explaining what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; natural laws are, as, for example, Newton's.  Well, of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they exist!  They are objective constraints on what can happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in our universe.  They are patterns that were here before us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and (heaven forbid) will be there after us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet the deist/Natural Rightist sees no difference or delamination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between Natural Law i.e. the laws of physics, and the Natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Man.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evidently not!  As the Jefferson quote above perhaps illustrates.
</em><br>
<p>Evidently so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Our Natural Rights evolve specifically out of our evolution, via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natural selection, as individualistic social primates with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inclination toward tool invention and use and exploration of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; habitat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It really surprises me that a number of distinguished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinkers can believe in such a thing given the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discoveries in so many branches of science, but especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropology.  You're quite clear and correct about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;individualistic social primates with an inclination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward tool invention&quot;, but what has this to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights?
</em><br>
<p>Natural Rights are those legal liberties which the evolutionary history
<br>
of human culture has demonstrated provide superior selection, survival,
<br>
of both the individual and the society in which the individual resides.
<br>
Human history is a record of this cultural evolutionary process: those
<br>
less free have less survivability, and their cultures are less likely
<br>
to survive, and those who are more free have greater survivability.
<br>
<p>This survivability is a consequence of the human animal's naturally
<br>
evolved characteristics. For example, when we speak of the natural
<br>
rights to keep and bear arms, and to defend oneself, one's family,
<br>
property, and nation, we can follow all the way back to Aristotle a
<br>
scientific recognition that societies which recognised this right had
<br>
greater survivability (as did the individuals who exercised these
<br>
rights). Weapons, as tools wielded by a technological primate with a
<br>
hand with an opposable thumb, are the natural right of those primates
<br>
to create, own, and use.
<br>
<p>Similarly, technology in general is the natural right of those primates
<br>
to create, own, and use, free of interference. These include cloning,
<br>
stem cells, cryonics, AI, space technology, nanotech, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism is a further development of this Enlightenment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophy.  As Greg Burch and Max More have previous said, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see ourselves as a more honest and consistent evolution of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Enlightenment philosophers than modern humanists and self-described
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; liberals, much as we see the US revolution as a more honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expression of that philosophy than the French Revolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could agree more, but not by much.  What the Enlightenment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophers achieved in my book is they described the ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (notions) that were being developed in their times, consciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or unconsciously, and expressed two important other things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One, that they highly approved of these new views, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two, such assumptions embodied into habit and legal precedent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *worked*, i.e., made societies more prosperous and resourceful.
</em><br>
<p>But WHY did they make societies more prosperous and resourceful if it
<br>
were not a matter of them being in greater agreement with the Objective
<br>
Truth embedded into the warp and weave of the universe? 
<br>
<p>The Enlightenment philosophers saw themselves first as scientists, for
<br>
they saw no delineation between scientists and philosophy, and both
<br>
existed to serve and demonstrate the validity of the deist God and his
<br>
wisdom in constructing such a universe. Our place in that universe is
<br>
to discover the Objective Truth of Natural Law through the use of
<br>
science and technology, and in the end to use that knowledge to reach
<br>
the Omega Point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Both modern humanism/liberalism and the French Revolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tread down paths to tyranny, genocide, dehumanization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the individual, and pastoral romanticism/mysticism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, their hearts are in the right place, and that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the most important things to them.
</em><br>
<p>Which has nothing to do with Enlightenment philosophy.
