<em>&gt; I'll simply try to put a little personal spin on this from an &quot;extropic&quot;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I like rhetorical discussions, so I'm thinking about posting
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) How many Iranians died due to the will of Saddam Husein?
</em><br>
<p><p>To which Samantha replied:
<br>
<p>&quot;How many of those did the US government encourage and aid him in 
<br>
killing?&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, without the efforts of Saddam and his government the number would be 
<br>
zero, so I don't see how that's relevant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) How many Kuwaitis were killed or raped due to the will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Saddam Husein?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Dunno. Probably far less than you might believe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Much like someone could say in regard to your outlandish casualty estimates 
<br>
in regard to a future conflict with Iraq.
<br>
<p>&quot;How many 
<br>
Iraqis were killed *after* we told Saddam that the conflict 
<br>
between he and Kuwait was between them?&quot;
<br>
<p>Would this somehow diminish Saddam's role in their deaths? 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3) How many Iraqis (i.e. his own citizens) were killed due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the will of Saddam Husein? 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Dunno. The famous gasing of the Kurds was covered up by us as 
<br>
accidental deaths in the crossfire by US for a while. We even 
<br>
used our armed forces to clean up the mess.&quot;
<br>
<p>And how does our actions in &quot;cleaning up the mess&quot; diminish Saddam's 
<br>
responsibility for these deaths?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 4) Would you be comfortable with a person like Sadaam Husein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walking the streets of your neighborhood?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Nope. I also wouldn't be comfortable at all with Bush (Sr. or 
<br>
Jr.), Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld or a host of others.&quot;
<br>
<p>Humorous, but I hope you're not suggesting that the parties within our 
<br>
government and Saddam Hussein are morally equivalent.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 5) If you are unwilling to have Saddam Husein living next to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you then why are you comfortable having him live next to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings like you in Baghdad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Why you are you comfortable with killing and proposing the 
<br>
killing of hundreds of thousands of humans just like you?&quot;
<br>
<p>Why are you comfortable in calling the Vietnam War senseless, when by 
<br>
abandoning Indochina we allowed the deaths of millions of humans just like 
<br>
you?
<br>
<p><p>Ø You may recall back a year or more ago, when I suggested what
<br>
<em>&gt; I thought was a perfectly reasonable (utilitarian) solution in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wake of 911 which was to nuke Afghanistan so as to completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate it as a potential source of unextropic vectors.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Yes. I thought you must of come seriously unhinged after 911. 
<br>
Such a proposal is as unextropic as it gets.&quot;
<br>
<p>As opposed to the career of Saddam Hussein?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soundly whacked in the side of the head for even considering such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an option. Here is the key point -- I was at least considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the utilitarian perspective (e.g. the needs of the many outweigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the needs of the few).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;You believe the many are served by obliterating the few by the 
<br>
country full from the face of the planet? by sanctioning the 
<br>
use of nukes when we get pissed off? by prophylacticly killing 
<br>
millions before they can be a threat? If you really believe 
<br>
these things then I certainly wouldn't want you living in my 
<br>
neighborhood either.&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not agree with Mr. Bradbury's &quot;unorthodox&quot; solution. However I cannot 
<br>
accept your suggestion that our response in regard to Afghanistan was due to 
<br>
the fact that we &quot;got pissed off.&quot; Indeed, it is fairly obvious to most 
<br>
observers who witnessed the events of 9/11 that there were elements in 
<br>
Afghanistan who were clearly a threat to us and would have continued to be 
<br>
had we taken no action. I doubt you would characterize our response to the 
<br>
December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor as a &quot;temper tantrum&quot;, so please 
<br>
don't insult everyone's intelligence by doing so in regard to Afghanistan. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; When you are thinking about Saddam &amp; Iraq you seriously have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask yourself whether one even gets up to that level (i.e. a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utilitarian tradeoff). We are talking about a country with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a population of only 24 million people and the 2nd largest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven oil reserves (~112+ billion barrels) in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless I'm doing my math wrong, that suggests that each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi citizen is worth ~$140,000 dollars (less production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs). Why are not *all* Iraqis living in &quot;palaces&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will throw down the gauntlet here. I will assert that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Husein is a demonstrably unextropic vector (to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree that he destroys the citizens of other countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and holds back the development and advancement of the citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Iraq.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;You have demonstrated that you yourself are capable of acting as 
<br>
a decidely unextropic and quite murderous vector.&quot;
<br>
<p>How has Mr. Bradbury demonstrated this? By blowing off steam in regard to a 
<br>
tyrannical monster? I hardly think that Mr. Bradbury's opinions put him in 
<br>
the same &quot;decidedly unextropic and murderous vector&quot; classification as Saddam 
<br>
Hussein. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;War generally is unextropic in the extreme. Perpetual war even 
<br>
more so.&quot;
<br>
<p>And I would argue that dismissing the Vietnam War, and more importantly 
<br>
ignoring the millions of lives snuffed out by totalitarian butchers 
<br>
afterwards, is equally unextropic.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This problem isn't going to go away. I think if the non-U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on the list will review the history -- the U.S. did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by and large try to stay out of both WWI and WWII. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach did not work. Furthermore, I think if one examines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the death tolls in those wars (e.g. the trench warfare or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the holocaust) one will observe that &quot;doing nothing&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially writing a prescription for millions of deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Doing the wrong thing causes even more deaths and likely puts 
<br>
off our favorite dreams for at least a generation AND unleashes 
<br>
a much higher likelihood of some of the nastier dystopias.&quot;
<br>
<p>You couldn't be more right here, as the example of Vietnam clearly 
<br>
illustrates. By doing the wrong thing, in this case abandoning our dependents 
<br>
in Indochina, we allowed the Communist butchers to unleash one of the worst 
<br>
dystopias the world has ever known.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Personally I consider any future that requires simply nuking 
<br>
entire countries out of existence to make &quot;the world safe for&quot; 
<br>
as a real dystopia.&quot;
<br>
<p>And it certainly would be, but that would hardly be our course of action in 
<br>
Iraq, so it's irrelevant.
<br>
<p><p>Ø So, to all &quot;extropians&quot;, I ask this question --
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;how do we prevent millions of deaths?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;By confronting and ending the murderous idiocy within ourselves 
<br>
and by confronting and ending the roots of war as thoroughly and 
<br>
quickly as we can.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am curious as to what your solution is, given that the roots of war 
<br>
surprisingly almost always involve the attempted spread of oppressive 
<br>
totalitarianism in some form. This can take the form of expanded influence or 
<br>
expanded territory. The diplomatic initiatives initiated by Clinton did not 
<br>
succeed in stemming Kim Jong Il's desire for nuclear weapons. In fact, they 
<br>
seem to have emboldened him. In the cases of Nazi Germany and the Soviet 
<br>
Union, for example, twiddling our thumbs did not stop their aggressive 
<br>
impulses. So, unfortunately we often must confront the murderous idiocy 
<br>
within others. You seem to enjoy criticizing and vilifying the United States, 
<br>
but I wonder how much responsibility you place on the shoulders of these 
<br>
other nations to prevent these dystopias you so fear.
<br>
<p>Max
<br>
<p><p>&quot;At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with 
<br>
America and little that is right.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
