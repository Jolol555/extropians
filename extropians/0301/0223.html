<br>
<p>&quot;North Vietnam was clearly a corrupt despotic state,
<br>
it subjugated oppressed and killed its people and was
<br>
bent on doing the same to South Vietnam, with the
<br>
industrial support of the Soviet Union, a similiarly
<br>
morally invalid state, and South Vietnam was a
<br>
democratic state that did not want to live under such
<br>
a rule.  While South Vietnam was not perfect, it was
<br>
orders of magnitude less imperfect than the north, and
<br>
regardless of who signed what, no document can make
<br>
what north vietnam did moral.&quot;
<br>
<p>Michael,
<br>
<p>You have repeatedly made the above claim.  And I have
<br>
responded by declaring it to be mythological nonsense
<br>
attributable to secular fundamentalism, specifically
<br>
anti-communist fundamentalism.  
<br>
<p>In support of my view I have provided extensive
<br>
authentic historic documentary resources, and can
<br>
easily provide more.  You have, to the best of my
<br>
recollection, provided no documentation.  Zero, zippo,
<br>
nada.  Nothing substantive, nothing credible.  Your
<br>
'evidence' has been limited entirely to usual
<br>
unsupported anti-communist exhortations.  
<br>
<p>No amount of declaring it to be so will make the moon
<br>
a lump of green cheese.  
<br>
<p>It is time for you to--as they say--shit or get off
<br>
the pot.  Provide some evidence--vetted to establish
<br>
its credibility--to support your point of view.  
<br>
<p>This is a forum which, ostensibly, places some value
<br>
on rational discourse.  Rational discourse is only
<br>
rational if it is supported by a foundation of fact. 
<br>
Establish your foundation of fact or retire to
<br>
ideological irrelevance.
<br>
<p>I'm tired of doing all the work of providing solid,
<br>
authentic, credible evidence, while you and others
<br>
repeat the &quot;communism is evil&quot; mantra, or provide
<br>
psuedo-journalism from propaganda organs.  Time for
<br>
you to face up to your responsibility, to first, find
<br>
the truth, and to then--and this is the hard
<br>
part--accept it.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During times of universal deceit, telling the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth becomes a revolutionary act.&quot;
