<p>
Some take the path of doing, and some take the path
<br>
of talking.  It is perhaps best that each takes the
<br>
path more suitable for him.
<br>
<p>Should I expect that those who take the path of doing
<br>
shall talk less?  Or perhaps that those of us who
<br>
take the path of talking should talk more?  I will,
<br>
I think, take the path of not expecting from others
<br>
at all, regardless of which path they take.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From our American Indian heritage, we have learned
</em><br>
that there are many paths.  Sometimes the path of
<br>
peace is chosen, but sometimes, the warpath is taken.
<br>
The talking on the Extropian list can sometimes lead
<br>
to understanding, but at other times that path can
<br>
lead to muddiness and false trails.  Let us hope that
<br>
the path of talking here, and doing there, lead each
<br>
traveler where he wants to go.  May light shine down
<br>
on all the paths, so that few lose their way.
<br>
<p>Some may say I'm pathetic, but I say to them that
<br>
they can mind their own ways, seek their own paths
<br>
---and I'll seek mine, and mind mine.
<br>
<p>Lee
