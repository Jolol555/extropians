Eliezer S. Yudkowsky said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Okay, so we should have extreme regard for the individual legal rights
<br>
of 
<br>
babies?  Incidentally, I think that while parents having control of 
<br>
children is often bad, having nonparents or governmental entities 
<br>
interfering is worse.  I don't say that it's none of my business; I say 
<br>
that my goal of protecting the child is best served by protecting the 
<br>
child from governers, not protecting the child from parents.  It's not a
<br>
<p>perfect solution, though.  I would - for example - look favorably on 
<br>
someone who released software that children could use to bypass parental
<br>
<p>restrictions on Internet access; I couldn't be on the child's side if I 
<br>
thought the child was the parent's property.  My theory here is that the
<br>
<p>child has full sentient rights, that a parent who shares 1/2 the child's
<br>
<p>DNA is statistically more likely to protect that child than a governer
<br>
who 
<br>
shares none of the child's DNA, and that the child, who shares 1.0 of
<br>
the 
<br>
child's DNA, is the best decider of all...&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't understand this at all!  Government only attempts to interfere
<br>
when a child's safety,
<br>
Or well being is at jeopardy.  The above writing sounds like children
<br>
should be able to make their
<br>
own decision as to read pornography, take drugs, and chat with
<br>
pedophiles before they are
<br>
emotionally and intellectually equipped to protect themselves.  
<br>
<p>Sometimes it is the parents they need protected from and then it's the
<br>
governments job to protect them if the parent fail in their
<br>
responseability.  Who shares the childs DNA is irrelevant, it is who is
<br>
morally and mentally equipped to take responseability for the child's
<br>
welfare until they are equipped 
<br>
themselves!
<br>
<p>This same type of stewardship should be taken to protect an AGI from
<br>
exploitation or 
<br>
corruption until it is morally and mentally equipped to take
<br>
responseability for 
<br>
it's own welfare!
<br>
<p>I don't think protecting and nurturing an entity to help it grow into a
<br>
healthy, happy, mature 
<br>
being is the same as enslaving it.  Quite the opposite in fact!
