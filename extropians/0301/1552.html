<p>Sorry to hear about that.  I figured that it was only as

bad in Canada as the United States.

<p>No, I'm afraid that you are completely right about that!

<p>Thanks for the rest of your report too!

<br>
<p>There is a major changing of the guard happening here [in Canada].
<br>
Cretien is leaving in 6 months.  His heir apparent is 65 so is not
<br>
there for a long time.
<br>
<p>The liberals have governed with a surplus thanks to low  interest rates on
<br>
old debt.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Some of the brighter lights have been ditched.  One in particular, Allan
<br>
Rock, the guy who launched the medical marijuana industry in Canada, is off
<br>
the roost because he got tarred with a gun registry  cost-overrun.
<br>
<p>It was first budgeted in 1995 at 2
<br>
million and then hid as a budget item so that now is &quot;locked in&quot; to costs
<br>
that near a billion.  The registry was so poor that the deadline for
<br>
200,000 to 2 million  as yet unregistered  guns  to declare/register was
<br>
dec31, 2002.  The online registry,voice mail and fax were all   overloaded
<br>
into a reverse  denial of service attack the last few days of 2002.  I just
<br>
left an email on Dec 31 saying that when they had a system able to respond
<br>
that I intended to register my 3 guns.  A month later I have get a response
<br>
or even an  acknowledgement.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I joked that it is going to take all the gov'ts profits from a number of
<br>
fees and taxes from  the imminent take-over of the marijuana industry  to
<br>
pay for the gun registry.  After all you can't have people running around
<br>
loose with guns robbing your marijuana stores.. EH! 
<br>
<p>The conservative party is looking for a new leader.  There are no Brian
<br>
Mulroney's from places like the Iron Ore Company of Canada  at close hand.
<br>
Actually Brian Mulroney came back from places like his VP job with ADM
<br>
(archer daniels midland) to try to flush out order from chaos. 
<br>
The Alliance has  just changed its name  from the Reform party and
<br>
reorganized  with a young but untested leader after skewering its former
<br>
leader.  The  party paid its former leader's  legal bills when he slandered
<br>
someone about an abortion related issue.... that and a few gaffs and
<br>
missteps had  cost him his leadership. 
<br>
<p>The most socialist, the NDP just elected a new leader yesterday.  This guy
<br>
and his wife are both Toronto city councilors.  The Toronto Extropians
<br>
might have comments on this pair. 
<br>
<p>Is he a &quot;Pierre Trudeau&quot; living from a fringe party?... 
<br>
So the only thing for sure about Canadian Politics is that an era of one
<br>
party rule is about over and  the new landscape is not entirely clear. 
<br>
RE- Europe/USA- my point was that countries like people can  become
<br>
functional specialists.  Not everyone has to be a policeman.  The USA
<br>
military technology  lead however should  give them the first shot at
<br>
commercializing civilian applications.  EU and Canada are better going
<br>
after the bio-sector.  Global warming could  make Canada a  many fold major
<br>
producer of bio-products. 
<br>
<p>You are right about the entrepreneurial spirit of the USA. In Canada  when
<br>
we want something to happen we ask the government to do it for us.  In the
<br>
USA you buy an investor database and get those phones and business plans
<br>
rolling.  Recently farmers were jailed for  refusing to pay fines for
<br>
selling their wheat in Montana and North Dakota without Government
<br>
permission.  Security does not always mean freedom. 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in my own, typically, arrogant, American way; allow me to suggest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the aforementioned societies you have listed, benefit, in large part,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from the US taxpayer footing the bill for a huge chuck of their security.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)  I mean, one can't afford socialized medicine, top of the line
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;education, and keep the Russian Bear (of Soviet vintage) and the Chinese
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dragon at bay.  Or rather we might, but that also would entail (me thinks)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;raising tariffs, and becoming Festung American (fortress). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To do that, it would take more unity of purpose then the US has, so far,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exhibited
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do think that using the UN to chop down the borders of rogue
<br>
states is preferred to all out war.  The one thing not to do is
<br>
rape a country economically like Germany was after WW1.  This
<br>
leads to radicalism like the 3rd Reich.  The middle east feels
<br>
culturally threatened and will risk world war to protect its
<br>
culture.  The culture is  just  a bit right of &quot;Klingon&quot;.
<br>
<p>Cultures do not evaporate overnight.  Countries like EU and
<br>
Canada are willing to expend social oriented militarism in
<br>
preference to supporting first strikes at war.  Military
<br>
technology to  support this can still create civilian spin-offs. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
bye for now..MJ
