<p>I'm not going to get into the tete-a-tet that Max and Ron seem
<br>
to be having.  I'll simply note that I read a very interesting
<br>
article in the NY Times a few days ago about the mini-war that
<br>
seems to currently be going on in northeastern Iraq.  It seems
<br>
that there is a collection of Islamic militants, perhaps including
<br>
terrorists funded by Iran and/or remnants of the Taliban and or
<br>
Al Queda who are in the process of taking territory away from the
<br>
Kurds.  The Times offered the suggestion that they are trying
<br>
to create a strict Islamic state (ala the Taliban/Afghanistan
<br>
model) in that part of Iraq).
<br>
<p>Another example of the problem with Islam could be the difficulties
<br>
found in Nigeria (Google on Nigeria, the Miss World pageant and
<br>
violence).
<br>
<p>There is a fundamental problem out there in the world -- intolerance.
<br>
Large numbers of people want to force the world to be the way *they*
<br>
want it to be -- this isn't just an &quot;Islamic&quot; thing, one can see it in
<br>
everyone from hardline Jewish settlers in Palestinian lands to
<br>
the anti-abortionists in the U.S.
<br>
<p>The question I would ask Max and others is &quot;When does one act?&quot;.
<br>
How much of Northern Iraq should we let the Islamic fundamentalists
<br>
take from the Kurds?  Do we allow them to create another Afghanistan?
<br>
Should we stand by while violence takes 100+ lives in Nigeria?
<br>
What about 1 million+ lives in Rwanda?
<br>
<p>I don't think we (the U.S., Europe, etc.) apply our interventionist
<br>
policies in very consistent ways.  I can think of Yugoslavia, East
<br>
Timor and Afghanistan as cases where we intervened with some success.
<br>
But it was only after a lot of human suffering had taken place.
<br>
<p>Sticking our heads in the sand doesn't solve the problems because
<br>
there are intolerant and/or power hungry people out there who
<br>
*will* take advantage of that situation (Hitler, Stalin, Milosevic,
<br>
Khomeini, Osama, Saddam, etc.).  The real question is how to
<br>
intervene in ways that don't create bigger problems down the
<br>
road (as many cold war activities may have done).
