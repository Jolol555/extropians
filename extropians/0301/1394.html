<p>Writers to the thread &quot;Why does the USA still have

reasons---perhaps you missed that discussion.  See

<em>&gt;&gt; Subject: RE: Why does the USA still have troops in rich Europe?
</em><br>
<p>The contributors to the thread came up with
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 1. Maintaining bases allows global military deployment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    in the interest of American foreign policy.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2. American defense contractors want to maximize sales to NATO.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3. A military ally that was as strong as the US (or anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    near) would rise a whole set of problems neither side
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    really wish to confront.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 4. The bases exist; it would be costly to rebuild them somewhere else
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 5. The political landscape here is rather stable and reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 6. To fulfill their duties according to the NATO treaties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 7. To maintain their NSA and CIA posts, the Echelon network, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 8. To keep a foot in the door for everything that happens [in Europe].
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think one has to divine motives or just one motive to US troops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being in Europe.  I think mostly they're there now, when the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason for them being there (the Soviet threat) is long gone just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of institutional inertia.
</em><br>
<p>So I nominate &quot;institutional inertia&quot; as reason number 9
<br>
on our list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some of the biggest proponents of NATO expansion are from the Halls of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;Axis of Corporate Evil&quot; -- to use Justin Raimondo's term --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Raytheon.  For example, the US Committee to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Expand NATO was cofounded by Bruce P. Jackson and Randy Scheunemann.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Following the money: Jackson is a VP at Lockheed Martin and Scheeunemann
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a registered agent for the same.  The rub here is that new NATO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members have to upgrade their militaries, which means business for --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you guessed it! -- defense contractors.  (Perhaps to call this &quot;evil&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit much.  After all, one would expect merchants of death, by nature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to want to sell weapons and other military systems.  So, in a mixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy, they would lobby for whatever it takes to sell their wares.)
</em><br>
<p>And this can replace our old &quot;reason number 2&quot;, which had
<br>
been &quot;Europeans save money on defense that way&quot;, which properly
<br>
belongs on the list of why the Europeans don't kick the Americans
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>2. American defense contractors want to maximize sales to NATO.
<br>
<p>9. Institutional inertia.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
