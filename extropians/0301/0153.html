<br>
<p>If you are looking at cloning with a critical view, then
<br>
what
<br>
about ICSI? You would need to look at ICSI with a similar
<br>
analysis. ICSI--the acronym for &quot;intracytoplasmic sperm injection&quot; now has
<br>
become the most powerful tool for the treatment of the kind of male
<br>
infertility when the 'sperm can't swim'. In one case out of four, men
<br>
with &quot;congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens&quot; (immobile
<br>
sperm) are also carriers of the gene for cystic fibrosis. Carl
<br>
Djerassi says in his essays that with ICSI, one can envisage a
<br>
scenario in which such men could pass on to their offspring both
<br>
infertility and cystic fibrosis, raising the specter of successive
<br>
generations requiring ICSI in order to perpetuate their genetic
<br>
immortality-an immortality compromised by a disease that brings a
<br>
slow, early death.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
In the last part of his essay, he writes:
<br>
<p>&lt;begin quote&gt;
<br>
<p>ICSI raises many other ethical and social problems beyond those
<br>
mentioned in the Melanie/Felix dialog. For example, now that the
<br>
effective separation of Y- and X- chromosome-bearing sperm has been
<br>
perfected, ICSI will enable parents to choose the sex of their
<br>
offspring with 100% certainty. For a couple with three or four
<br>
daughters, who keep on breeding in order to have a son, the ability to
<br>
choose a child's sex may actually prove a benefit to society, but what
<br>
if practiced widely in cultures (such as China or India) that greatly
<br>
favor male children over girls?
<br>
<p>Or consider the capability of preserving the sperm of a recently
<br>
deceased man (say 24 - 30 hours post mortem) in order to produce
<br>
(through ICSI) a live child months or even years later-a feat that has
<br>
already been accomplished. Here we have immortality with a
<br>
vengeance. But what of the product of such a technological tour de
<br>
force? Using the frozen sperm and egg of deceased parents would
<br>
generate instant orphans under the microscope. The prospect is
<br>
grotesque-yet does it take much imagination or compassion to conceive
<br>
of circumstances where a widow might use the sperm of a beloved
<br>
deceased husband so that she can have their only child? These issues
<br>
are intrinsically gray; the technology occupies an ambiguous position,
<br>
enabling us to enact our best and worst impulses, and the answers
<br>
cannot be provided by scientists or technologists. The ultimate 
<br>
judgment must be society's, which, in the case of sex and
<br>
reproduction, really means the individual affected. Ultimately, that
<br>
individual is the child, yet the decision must be made before its
<br>
birth by the parents-or more often than we care to admit, by just one
<br>
parent.
<br>
<p>It is the nature of such questions that they resist convenient
<br>
solutions, not least because of their tendency to proliferate faster
<br>
than we can solve them. Whereas reproduction has historically tended
<br>
to exemplify the law of unintended consequences, the addition of
<br>
technology has given that law added force. Consider: until very
<br>
recently, the onset of the menopause was welcomed by many women as the
<br>
release from continuous pregnancies caused by unprotected and
<br>
frequently unwanted intercourse. But the arrival of the Pill and other
<br>
effective contraceptives, coupled with the greatly increased number of
<br>
women entering demanding professions that cause them to delay
<br>
childbirth until their late thirties or early forties, now raises the
<br>
concern that the menopause may prevent them from becoming mothers
<br>
altogether. Whereas reproductive technology's focus during the latter
<br>
half of the 20th century was *contraception*, the technological
<br>
challenge of the new millennium may well be *conception* (or
<br>
*infection*, if one focuses on sexually transmitted diseases). In the
<br>
long run, if the cryopreservation of gametes followed by sterilization
<br>
becomes a common practice, contraception may even become
<br>
superfluous. Melanie and Felix in the above fictitious dialog were
<br>
hardly the first to express such speculation.
<br>
<p>In 1994, in the scientific journal Nature, the cryobiologist Stanley
<br>
Leibo and I addressed the deplorable prognosis for a new male
<br>
contraceptive in the next few decades, given the total lack of
<br>
interest in that field by the large pharmaceutical companies without
<br>
whose participation such a &quot;Pill for Men&quot; could never be
<br>
introduced. This led us to propose an alternative approach, not
<br>
involving the drug industry, based on a few simple
<br>
assumptions. Millions of men-admittedly, most of them middle-aged
<br>
fathers rather than young men-have resorted to sterilization
<br>
(vasectomy) and continue to do so. The procedure is much simpler and
<br>
less invasive than tubal ligation in women. (Sterilization among both
<br>
sexes has become so prevalent that in the U.S., it is now the most
<br>
common method of birth control among married couples, even surpassing
<br>
the Pill). Artificial insemination is both simple and
<br>
cheap. Furthermore, among fertile couples, it has almost the same
<br>
success rate as ordinary sexual intercourse. But most important for
<br>
our argument, fertile male sperm has already been preserved
<br>
inexpensively for years at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Therefore,
<br>
provided one first demonstrated that such storage is possible for
<br>
several decades rather than just years, some young men might well
<br>
consider early vasectomy, coupled with cryopreservation of their
<br>
fertile sperm and subsequent artificial insemination, as a viable
<br>
alternative to effective birth control. Shifting more of that
<br>
responsibility to men, at least in monogamous, trusting relationships,
<br>
appeared to Leibo and me a socially responsible suggestion. I shall
<br>
spare the readers a record of the resulting outcry-both by media and
<br>
in personal correspondence-but a lot has happened in the intervening
<br>
few years to make it much more likely that such a prediction will
<br>
become fact within a few decades rather than dramatic license.
<br>
<p>Although many may consider some of the scenarios raised in *AN
<br>
IMMACULATE MISCONCEPTION* as &quot;unnatural&quot; or worse, every one of them
<br>
has now been realized or is about to be implemented. Take the question
<br>
of post-menopausal pregnancies. In progressively more geriatric
<br>
societies (for example, in Japan or Western Europe), where 20 per cent
<br>
of the population is already or will soon be over the age of sixty,
<br>
and older people are increasingly healthier than they used to be, a
<br>
woman who becomes a mother at 45 could raise a child for a
<br>
considerably longer time than could a 20-year-old at the beginning of
<br>
this century. Of course, motherhood at an older age is physically,
<br>
psychologically, and economically suitable only for certain women, but
<br>
at least the choice is now available in wealthy countries. It must be
<br>
emphasized that this increased emphasis on artificial fertilization
<br>
techniques and even surrogate parentship is a characteristic of the
<br>
affluent, &quot;geriatric&quot; countries. Even within these countries, the cost
<br>
of such reproductive technologies (frequently not covered by
<br>
insurance) is such that only the more affluent citizens can afford
<br>
them. Three-fourths of the world's population are represented by the
<br>
&quot;pediatric&quot; countries of Africa, Asia and much of Latin America, where
<br>
over 40% of the population may be below the age of fifteen and where
<br>
the control of fertility rather than the treatment of infertility will
<br>
remain the catchword for decades to come.
<br>
<p>I have deliberately refrained from considering the implications of
<br>
human cloning-the closest technological approach to immortality. But
<br>
to the extent that biological parenthood is a form of
<br>
immortality-admittedly one subject to mutational and hence
<br>
evolutionary adjustments-IVF tampers with that as well. In the excerpt
<br>
from my play, I allude to pre-implantation embryonic genetic
<br>
screening, again a procedure primarily available to the affluent in
<br>
the affluent countries. But soon, the entire human genome will be
<br>
elucidated. Given the many technically feasible methods of rapid
<br>
genetic screening, what will keep prospective IVF parents from
<br>
screening their own embryos so as to transfer only the &quot;best&quot; back
<br>
into the mother? Who will define &quot;best&quot;? Few people will argue that
<br>
prospective parents may wish to discard embryos that show the markers
<br>
for Down's or Huntington's Syndrome, or markers for genetically
<br>
transmitted cancers, but where will the line be drawn? Short stature?
<br>
Left-handedness? Big ears? As we move in the direction of tailor-made
<br>
progeny, the gulf between the haves and have-nots is widening
<br>
enormously.
<br>
<p>The recent advances in contraceptive and reproductive technologies
<br>
have clearly raised a multitude of gray problems which many of us
<br>
would like to wish away. But that is not possible anymore - the genie
<br>
has escaped from the bottle. Legislation will not offer a solution,
<br>
unless it were global in nature. Otherwise, a committed couple-or
<br>
perhaps just the woman-will cross geographical borders in an attempt
<br>
to circumvent biological ones. The answer is intensive and continuous
<br>
debate, based on knowledge rather than myth, which is one of the
<br>
reasons why I, the scientist, have moved to fiction and drama as novel
<br>
ways to raise the intellectual level of public discourse of sex and
<br>
reproduction.
