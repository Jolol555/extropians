<p><em>&gt;I don't know about Natasha, but I do some work for a small publishing 
</em><br>
company and have worked in the field part-time for a few years.&lt;
<br>
<p>You offer excellent advise.  Thank you.  I'm not a publisher, so I don't 
<br>
know your end of the business.  But what I do know is that my book 
<br>
would not have sold out 3 times unless I had already created a name 
<br>
for myself and had the advantage of lots of articles and TV 
<br>
documentaries mentioning my work.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is the hook.  If a writer already has even a wee bit of 
<br>
recognition and has created his or her own area of expertise, then he 
<br>
or she will already have sales in the making.  
<br>
<p>Further, already having self-published and also created a name for 
<br>
oneself is a fine strategy for getting a sound publisher when the time 
<br>
comes.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Natasha
<br>
<p>Unless you're a professional and tour talking and selling your book you 
<br>
won't do too well regardless. A dud poet might sell 50 copies of their 
<br>
book over time, a zippy one with connections 500 (in Australia or 
<br>
Ireland, for example). 
<br>
<p>Print on demand is cheap considering. A few hundred with lighning 
<br>
source for example gets you set up and they list your book. You can 
<br>
then advertise it on the web including through a site with teasers etc... 
<br>
It's dead easy to do the cover and pdf file from word with Acrobat PDF 
<br>
writer for word (note remember to embed fonts and un-default the dpi 
<br>
for images to a high resolution). I'm not an expert on web sales.
<br>
<p>The big question is when e-ink is going to launch book format digital 
<br>
paper and what associated programming interactions occur. At this 
<br>
stage I can only note that one of the founders of eink is now working on 
<br>
printable chips and circuitry. Cheap flexible circuitry and 
<br>
already-designed flat paper batteries are obviously going to be part of 
<br>
the next generation, but the first generation still awaits. Eink's website 
<br>
is pretty coy. They're really building up to go whammo all at once, 
<br>
papers and books, if you ask me. Optimistically it's this year, possibly 
<br>
soon. Hard to call. I think it's made, it's just the manufacturing
<br>
finalities 
<br>
and distribution. They're obviously going gung-ho at these by farming 
<br>
out functions, based on the coca-cola model (they say).
<br>
<p>If this goes ahead, having a sexy book on a website will allow you 
<br>
downloadable (to digital paper book) possibilities. If so, having sexy 
<br>
design, credit card facilities, a willingness to offer the book cheaper 
<br>
and a willingness to advertise by whatever means available is going to 
<br>
help, including links etc.. Ideally for all WTA/extropian books, cheap 
<br>
versions should be available on the net, but it's all complicated. I'm 
<br>
super glad Drexler is available for free on the net. Links to all these 
<br>
books on all websites are one aspect of things. This means having a 
<br>
strong, coherent, well laid out connection to texts near or on home 
<br>
pages, if you ask me (along with links to our peak bodies).
<br>
<p>Being realistic, at the moment, I'd recommend you submit your book to 
<br>
every single mainstream publisher first. Dune got 15 or so rejections, 
<br>
don't forget. They have the ability currently to get at least a thousand 
<br>
and probably closer to 10 or 15 thousand of your book into libraries and 
<br>
bookstores.
<br>
<p>However, it does also depend on how much money and time you're 
<br>
willing to commit. $1,000 will get you a great book launch with 300 or 
<br>
350 people. Radio ads on student radio, etc. etc.. This is the sort of 
<br>
thing only a motivated professional with some leave time can do and is 
<br>
not a money-making venture (if self-publishing is involved). You can 
<br>
also maybe swing a deal with a small press and fund it but have it 
<br>
done through them: this is not something that is necessarily easy or 
<br>
practical.

<em>&gt; &gt; I'd like to suggest my self-published book _Create/Recreate: The 
</em><br>
3rd
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Millennial Culture_ because it is the only book available to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; date that explains the history of transhumanism.  It also focuses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on our culture and the earliest films, videos and writings of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natasha, I'm interested to hear more about your experience with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-publishing.  As I've posted to the list, I'm working on my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book, _More Than Human_, which is an overview of several 
</em><br>
transhumanist
<br>
<em>&gt; technologies and an argument that fundamentally we ought to 
</em><br>
pursue
<br>
<em>&gt; these technologies as a way to improve ourselves and our world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now I'm considering both traditional publishing (I'm about to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start my search for an agent) and self-publishing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any words of wisdom about self-publishing?  Would you do it again?
</em><br>
