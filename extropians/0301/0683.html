<p><em>&gt; The fact that a term is used in ambiguous ways doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can't also be used more rigorously by people who agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a foundation.
</em><br>
<p>I guess not, but, I find their terms confusing and unnecessary,
<br>
just as I do Jefferson's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the libertarian/anarchocapitalist/individualist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation of &quot;natural rights&quot; is reasonably consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and useful, even if some of those who use it probably go too far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So what then?  Are we to follow your reasoning and suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that human sacrifice is a part of natural law?  Moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I guess that you've got the ultimate argument that we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use to dispose of the socialists:  &quot;You see,&quot; we tell them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Capitalism is just a part of natural law, resistance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; futile&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If sacrifice succeeded more than other cultures of the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which I don't concede for a moment, but I do concede that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be possible), then that only shows that some particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex collection of cultural memes with a certain feature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out-competed some other complex collection without that feature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That says little about the individual feature unless you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to study a very large number of cultures over a long time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and draw good conclusions.  I suspect that if the correlation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you posit really existed, it would just be a statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artifact.
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite follow.  If human sacrifice turned out to be as
<br>
among primitive cultures as common as incest taboo, then, while
<br>
I agree that the *explanation* might be vastly more complex---
<br>
e.g., my chess example of a truth that can't be easily chunked
<br>
---it would still be what some might want to call a &quot;natural law&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, something like &quot;supply and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demand&quot; is more likely to show up as a real &quot;law&quot; of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior that's universal and exists in exactly the same sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that laws of physics exist, even prior to their discovery.
</em><br>
<p>Now yes indeed, that's practically a law of nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will also concede that &quot;natural rights&quot; is a term inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two steps removed from reality in the sense that it implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both that there are natural laws of human behavior, and further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many of them are expressible in terms of &quot;rights&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are restraints of secondary action.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I.e., when we say that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a &quot;right&quot; to action X, what we mean is that we think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong for person B to restrain or punish person A for X, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a circuitous way of saying that the action of such restraint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or punishment leads to bad outcomes.
</em><br>
<p>Well said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is probably true that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are universals in this form: a culture that restrains or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishes political speech is probably doomed to failure, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressing this universal in terms of a &quot;right to free speech&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is perfectly reasonable.
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with simply endorsing the simpler claim &quot;Our
<br>
society and all modern ones should endorse the legal right
<br>
to freedom of speech&quot;?
<br>
<p>Now as I first asked Ron, and as Michael Butler responded,
<br>
I suppose that a political necessity might exist for claiming
<br>
more than the bare facts warrant, and that the reification
<br>
of some sort of &quot;rights&quot; in the abstract pays dividends.  An
<br>
old paradox: should the plain truth be spoken to our political
<br>
disadvantage?  Well, we've all wrestled with that, and know
<br>
the answer. (&quot;It depends.&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there may be other such laws that aren't expressible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that way, and indeed for which such an expression gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the way of seeing the underlying truth.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, sounds like an important corollary.
