<p><em>&gt; Since the sixties, wouldn't it be incorrect to say that

</em><br>
<p>Until Germany regained her sovereignty after reunification, the
<br>
Amerian/British/French and Soviet troops in West and East Germany,
<br>
respectively, were military occupation forces that administered the
<br>
armistice after the unconditional surrender of the German Empire
<br>
on May 8, 1945.  Officially, peace hadn't even been declared.  Any
<br>
approval or disapproval of the German governments or people to this
<br>
state of affairs was quite coincidental.
<br>
<p>Listening to AFN (American Forces radio/TV Network) was quite
<br>
enlightening about the attitudes of the American troops, even in
<br>
the 1990s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I really would like to know why American forces are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still in Europe;
</em><br>
<p>Because maintaining bases that allow global military deployment is
<br>
in the interest of American foreign policy.
