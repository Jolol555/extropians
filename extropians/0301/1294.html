<em>&gt; Subject: Nano and respirocytes
</em><br>
<p>Yvan, I believe, wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let see if I have understood something about &quot;respirocytes&quot;: They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; micrometer sized spherical diamond tanks able to store gazeous oxygen at high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure with the help of a centrifugal pump using a 10 nanometer rotor...
</em><br>
<p>They are slightly more complex than that.  They are ~micrometer (bacteria
<br>
or red blood cell) sized.  They contain multiple tanks (for storing O2, CO2,
<br>
glucose and ballast) -- [go read the paper -- it is *quite* detailed].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, why diamond? graphite sheet are nearly as strong and there is a well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established technology to make them in the bulk.
</em><br>
<p>Because to store gases at high pressure with sufficient safety you need
<br>
a 10-nm thick wall (~60 carbon atoms) bonded together with a diamond
<br>
(tetrahedral) bonding structure.  You might be able to get equivalent
<br>
strength with a nested buckytube/buckyball design but I believe it would
<br>
require making the tanks much larger.  Material strength is determined
<br>
by the number of covalent bonds per unit volume and thus far diamonod
<br>
and sapphire are at the top of the list.  (There is some speculation
<br>
from computer models that some forms of Boron-Nitride might trump diamond
<br>
but nobody has managed to create those yet.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, What is a submicrometer gas?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, I don't believe I used the term &quot;submicrometer gas&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, according to my Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, the lattice
<br>
parameters for solid oxygen in the alpha, betta and gamma structures
<br>
range from 0.34 to 0.68 nanometers.  I would expect the atomic spacing
<br>
in gaseous (molecular) O2 to be somewhat larger but not too much so.
<br>
[What one changes in going from a gas to a solid is not so much the
<br>
average distance between the molecules (or atoms) but their velocity.]
<br>
<p>In any gas, liquid or solid that I'm aware of one is always dealing
<br>
with extremely sub-micrometer scales -- heck a ribosome which is a
<br>
really big collection of molecules is only ~30 nm (0.03 micro-meters)
<br>
in size.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At that scale, surface effects are dominant.
</em><br>
<p>At the micrometer scale there are complex interactions based on
<br>
surface structure.  This is discussed extensively in Section 9.4
<br>
of Nanomedicine when nanorobot locomtion and blood viscosity
<br>
is discussed.  At the nanometer (atomic/molecular) scale you
<br>
are dealing mainly with the various forces that bond atoms and
<br>
molecules together (covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals
<br>
forces, etc.).  Perhaps this is what you mean, in which case I
<br>
concur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about using capillarity to load a cylindrical bottle made from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nanotube?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there is a problem with the idea in principle, I suspect
<br>
however it would be slower than the molecular rotary sorters.  This
<br>
is because with capillary action I believe you are relying on passive
<br>
diffusion, while using the rotary sorters I believe you are using
<br>
active transport.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems that has been done for hydrogen, why to build atom by a atom a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diamond structure?
</em><br>
<p>First, please do *not* assume that one must build robust nanotechology
<br>
&quot;atom by atom&quot;.  This is a mistake commonly made by everyone from
<br>
press reporters to Nobel prize winners (who cast themselves as experts
<br>
qualified to critique nanotech).  For example, Ralph Merkle has proposed
<br>
building diamondoid structures from &quot;adamantane&quot; building blocks which
<br>
contain over 10 carbon atoms.  In the precise definition of molecular
<br>
nanotechnology it is understood that one does not need to build things
<br>
&quot;atom by atom&quot; but one needs to build things which are &quot;atomically precise&quot;
<br>
(i.e. the atoms have a precise location where they should be).  This is
<br>
no different from what happens in biology -- proteins are constructed
<br>
from &quot;large&quot; amino acids and those not constructed properly are rapidly
<br>
recycled by cells (at least when thing are working optimally).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Diamond or not, carbon and high pressure oxygen are a noxious mix.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Carbon and Oxygen will burn to produce CO2.  But you fail to
<br>
cite the basic chemisty -- what is required to initiate this reaction?
<br>
I can take a wooden log and put it in my fireplace (I.e. a reduced
<br>
hydrocarbon substance C + H) and let it sit in an atmosphere containing
<br>
a lot of O2 and it doesn't spontaneously combust (producing CO2 and H2O).
<br>
<p>You need to cite some concrete chemistry and thermodynamics before
<br>
you can turn a &quot;noxious mix&quot; into an unacceptable gas storage
<br>
strategy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you really would try to make such a complex, unstable, costly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing when fixing an ahemoglobin molecule to a carbon nanotube would do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same work at some $/kg?
</em><br>
<p>Complex -- agreed.  All nanorobot structure and engineering *will*
<br>
be complex.  Even a quick glance at the respirocyte paper shows that
<br>
it is very complex.  A respirocyte has 18 billion atoms in it.  That
<br>
is 4 orders of magnitude more parts than are in the most advanced
<br>
planes built by Boeing.  So I *fully* expect there will be companies
<br>
*larger* than Boeing who make it their business to produce even
<br>
a single type of nanorobot.  Will they be funded?  I think so.
<br>
The company that produces the respirocyte will be adding a window
<br>
of survival of 30+ minutes to every individual who might ever suffer
<br>
from a heart attack or a stroke (we are talking probably 40+% of
<br>
the causes of death).  There is going to be a *big* market for such
<br>
a product.
<br>
<p>Will it be &quot;costly&quot;?  Initially probably yes, but the market will
<br>
be so large that one can rapidly expect competition and the cost
<br>
reductions that will enable.
<br>
<p>Will it be &quot;unstable&quot;?  You haven't proven that point (at least
<br>
to me).
<br>
<p>The fundamental problem with hemoglobin molecules attached to a
<br>
carbon nanotubes is that it doesn't significantly alter the
<br>
oxygen storage density.  In fact it probably makes it worse.
<br>
(Hemoglobin alone is a fairly efficient oxygen carrier).
<br>
<p>The fundamental advantage of respirocytes is that they store
<br>
the greatest number of oxygen (or CO2) molecules in the smallest
<br>
volume.  That is accomplished by storing the gas molecules under
<br>
high pressure in the strongest containers we currently believe
<br>
can be manufactured.
<br>
<p>If you think buckytubes and hemoglobin can do a better job then
<br>
I would suggest you go do the math and present it to us.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
Robert Bradbury
