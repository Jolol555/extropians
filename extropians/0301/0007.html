In a message dated 1/1/2003 1:46:26 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Another%20Hypothesis">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes: You need to look no further than the current 
<br>
case of Zacarias Moussaoui who is currently on trial in federal court. 
<br>
## Is this the character you have been touting as an American Citizen being 
<br>
imprisoned on secret evidence?  He is not an American Citizen, he may not 
<br>
even be a legal alien.  He has not been imprisoned as yet.  He has been held 
<br>
as a bad risk of fleeing our nation's jurisdiction.  That is an old procedure 
<br>
that goes back to our nation's beginnings and is used by almost every country 
<br>
on the globe.  But even then he is held by order of a judge after having his 
<br>
day in court represented by an attorney. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your other statements about secret evidence being withheld from the 
<br>
prisoner and his attorney is exaggerated.  The court has considered how it 
<br>
might permit the evidence to be given, provided to the attorney and prisoner, 
<br>
without letting it come into the public domain.  Apparently this is nearly 
<br>
impossible so the government is not allowed to use it at all.  The government 
<br>
is now considering the alternative of a military tribunal but still the 
<br>
evidence will be still be provided to the defendant and his attorney.  As I 
<br>
have told you before that procedure goes back at least to the 2nd world war 
<br>
to my certain knowledge.
<br>
<p>&quot;put him through a military tribunal with no involvement from the courts and 
<br>
without giving any information to the courts&quot;
<br>
## And once again you are wrong on all counts.  A military tribunal is a 
<br>
court.  You can bet that a civilian court will have to rule on the legality 
<br>
of transfering the defendents case to a military court before he can be tried 
<br>
in the military court.  In addition your statement &quot;without giving any 
<br>
information to the courts&quot; is pure hyperbole.  Military courts come under the 
<br>
jurisdiction of what is called The Unified Code of Military Justice.  The 
<br>
UCMJ was passed by Congress in the late 40s and is a strict but fair set of 
<br>
laws.  Every person entering the military is lectured extensively about the 
<br>
code upon entry.  I passed a course in the UCMJ that went into even more 
<br>
depth and lived under that code for over four years.  So has every other 
<br>
ex-serviceman under age of 70.  I have read that studies show a higher 
<br>
percentage of defendents beat the rap in military courts than in civilian 
<br>
courts.
<br>
<p>&quot;The courts only know about this trial because it has already started in the 
<br>
civil courts.&quot;
<br>
## I wonder what you think that means?  Of course the military courts don't 
<br>
know about the case directly because it hasn't come before them.  Naturally 
<br>
the officers of the military courts do read the news papers like the rest of 
<br>
us so on that level they have heard of it.  Someone can correct me if I am 
<br>
wrong but I don't believe the guys that would try this case have even been 
<br>
appointed yet.
<br>
<p>&quot;For future cases held in the secret military tribunals, the courts would not 
<br>
even be informed that the event had occurred.&quot;  Where did you ever get the 
<br>
idea that we have such a thing as a &quot;secret military tribunal?&quot;  The military 
<br>
is almost always sort of strict but wonderfully open and direct.  Everyone 
<br>
around the trial area will know about the trial.  Maybe someone can help me 
<br>
with this also, I haven't studied the UCMJ for 45 years but Harvey says &quot;the 
<br>
courts would not even be informed that the event had occurred.&quot;  Assuming 
<br>
that Harvey means that the civilian courts would not even be informed of the 
<br>
military trials after the first one, isn't it true that all military trials 
<br>
come under the Federal Court system and can be appealed in Federal Court?
