</em><br>

<em>&gt; WWII yet find the same attempt to oppose an even more murderous regime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'senseless' when considering Vietnam. 
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Vietnam is a much less clearcut case. I have neither the time 
<br>
nor inclination to debate Vietnam when a much more pressing and 
<br>
immediate senseless war is staring us in the face. That is not 
<br>
&quot;bobbing and weaving&quot;. It is recognizing priorities and 
<br>
meaningless tactics that it is pointless to spend precious time 
<br>
playing to.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>These are hardly meaningless tactics, when you suggest that we have a &quot;more 
<br>
pressing and immediate senseless war&quot; staring us in the face. You are thereby 
<br>
suggesting that the Vietnam War was senseless, and are attempting to tie in 
<br>
the fact that action in Iraq would be an equal mistake. Now, Michael, I, and 
<br>
several others have done are best to respectfully debate and refute that 
<br>
contention. You have stated that war is justifiable when it combats an &quot;evil 
<br>
expansionistic power&quot; and we have made clear that the Soviet Union met both 
<br>
descriptions, and the same could be said about Ho's Communist Vietnam. Your 
<br>
apparent contention that &quot;all war is bad, except against the Nazis&quot; will 
<br>
continue to be seen as a hopelessly naïve and empty argument unless you can 
<br>
justify your position.  How is it that opposing expansionistic 
<br>
totalitarianism in the form of the Nazis is acceptable while opposing 
<br>
Communism, a larger and more expansionstic evil, is not?  
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; I also asked you multiple times what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you felt of the Korean war, and to compare and contrast it with the Vietnam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I am not interest in such a discussion. So what?&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Nothing, other than the fact that it leads one to believe that you are not 
<br>
knowledgeable enough on these topics to justify your positions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since I made a valient attempt to not come off as making personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks or present my case in a condescending tone, I can only conclude 
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; you can not present the justification for your opinions on these matters 
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; thus choose to ignore them entirely. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It is not worth my time or yours.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Since when it is not worth one's time in a debate for someone to define their 
<br>
positions with evidence rather than emotional appeals and empty claims?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or perhaps a small seed of doubt has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been planted in the back of your mind that those anti-war protests you took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part in actually contributed to the mass murder of millions of Indochinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. Perhaps you find this so disturbing that this is why you ignore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these comments and inquiries. Or perhaps I have allready made it into your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'kill file' Got to silence those dissenting opinions eh? Or maybe im just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a promoter of 'anti-communist propoganda'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Nope, not a single seed of doubt that that war was morally 
<br>
reprehensible from the beginning. Sorry.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>You're right, it absolutely was. Perhaps you'd like to bring that up with the 
<br>
Vietnamese Communists and their sponsors who started it?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;I am done with your massive intellectual dishonesty&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intellectual dishonesty? I am still waiting to hear if you feel the korean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war was also 'senseless' and if it wasn't, why was it not senseless yet the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vietnam war was?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I am no expert on the Korean War. Do I have to analyze every 
<br>
single war to your satisfaction to point out the absurdity of 
<br>
this one? No, I don't think so. And I don't believe asking me 
<br>
to play such a game instead of dealing directly with the 
<br>
arguments is a sign of an honest and to the point discussion.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>To my knowledge, you have not analyzed any war to anyone's satisfaction, 
<br>
unless you call labeling something as &quot;senseless&quot; analysis. Michael's 
<br>
inquiries are totally relevant to the point. If you are unable to back up 
<br>
your blanket statements with evidence, there really isn't any point in you 
<br>
having them.

America and little that is right.&quot;
