&lt;&lt;Saddam is busy creating ABC weapons when he really should develop 
<br>
inexpensive unmanned drones that could automatically fight incomming jet 
<br>
fighters. Relying on distributed intelligence.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>There was a program in the 1980s which involved robotized MIG's, which would 
<br>
have dropped the element technetium, as a general poison. The Iraqi research 
<br>
indicated this would prove ineffective. It was determined, by Iraqi 
<br>
researchers, that bio-warfare; dropped from such drones would be lethal.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I Imagine a swarm of those inexpensive drones (10-100) cirkling 10 km 
<br>
over any &quot;hot spot&quot;, armed with camera or radar guided machineguns.
<br>
I bet that any jet would have a difficult time getting passed those.
<br>
But perhaps a dictator like him, by nature have difficulties in 
<br>
imagening distributed systems being efficient.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Germans, during WW2 had radar-controlled flak cannon and searchlights, 
<br>
and it was still overwhelmed by shear force of allied bombardments, 
<br>
especially when those sites were targeted. The Russians and Chinese have 
<br>
adapted such a system, with limited effect and success.
