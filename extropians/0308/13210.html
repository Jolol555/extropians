<p><em>&gt; Uploading, yes. But first need to refine/isolate the essential element
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the 'stuff' to be uploaded.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think &quot;uploading&quot; needs to be explored in much greater detail
<br>
as to *what* one uploads -- memories, experiences, strategies, awareness,
<br>
etc.  How much of oneself is one willing to &quot;give away&quot; vs. how much of
<br>
oneself one wants to restrict access to or even destroy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Matter transmutation: Not merely changing state: becoming something new.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, Could body be to consciousness-&gt;'stuff' as uranium is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radium-&gt; helium?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but I would definitely
<br>
place a strong vote in the probability that many humans are facing
<br>
a &quot;transmutation&quot; of sorts.  I sum this up as &quot;You must be willing
<br>
to give up everything you are for what you might become.&quot;  Everything
<br>
changes significantly when inter-consciousness bandwidth begins to
<br>
approach the ability to communicate the information content of a
<br>
consciousness in a relatively short period (e.g. seconds-to years --
<br>
right now it cannot be done in a current human lifespan).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Current 'reality'? You mean the life-death encapsulated event
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions: the rigidly narrow 'moment of death,' 'moment of birth'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes?
</em><br>
<p>To a large extent that is what I mean.  Of course Brett is a better
<br>
person to comment on the &quot;moment of birth&quot; (a 32 cell embryo, a
<br>
baby delivered prematurely at 6-months, a 9-month natural birth,
<br>
a baby who is post the &quot;terrible twos&quot; who can speak and largely
<br>
deal with nutrition and waste disposal functions, etc.)  Regarding
<br>
&quot;moment of death&quot;, it obviously a sliding scale.  One sees this
<br>
nearly every week on &quot;Emergency Room&quot; when they decide how long to
<br>
try and &quot;recover&quot; a patient.  If and when the first brain transplant
<br>
is ever done the &quot;moment of death&quot; is going to become really messy.
<br>
<p>So we live in an environment where these &quot;moments&quot; are chainging.
<br>
People don't like that.  They had best get over it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Human gestation takes a minimum of 18 months - 9 inside, 9
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onside and then some. If life-death transitions are on a continuum over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, then might uploading be similar?
</em><br>
<p>Quite possibly.  It would be a shame (IMO) if uploading turns into an
<br>
all-or-nothing situation.  It would be much more interesting if one
<br>
was able to selectively manage *how* much was uploaded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could uploading be occurring all the time?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Both Bostrom and Freitas have argued that the odds are we are in
<br>
a simulation.  I don't know if they are right, but if so, then uploading
<br>
and downloading could be taking place all the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could uploading efficiency and intensity increase between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those persons who are most alike? As in 'like attracts like'? And the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'meeting of minds'?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know.  Like-attracts-like probably promotes survival rates.
<br>
So you would probably have to setup an non-logical simulation (chaos
<br>
or anarchy) for LAL to not be the common pattern.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of what 'stuff' dreams are made? Have our ancestors already been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded into us?
</em><br>
<p>If, and its a big *IF*, complexification is a worthy goal in the universe,
<br>
then probably one does not want to replay past scenarios.  So uploading
<br>
our ancestors makes no sense -- only playing out the game in future time
<br>
does.  (Now obviously one can start *multiple* games at various positions
<br>
of evolution -- so it *may* make sense if one has a highly unusual &quot;spin&quot;
<br>
one wants to put on reality.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we can tune into that 'stuff' will we see so far back, we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see Death dancing on the winds of time like an impotent buffoon?
</em><br>
<p>Raises the question of whether we are in a simulation or not?  Which
<br>
also raises the question of whether or not one can &quot;kill&quot; your copies
<br>
if one recognizes one is in a simulation (and can impact the copies)?
<br>
I believe those questions are unresolved at this time.  If we are in a
<br>
simulation, and/or if we are in a Multiverse, making the problem worse
<br>
since we are but one of many simulations, then I would tend to view
<br>
&quot;death&quot; as a &quot;buffoon&quot;.
<br>
<p>Though I am not suggesting action based on these perceptions since this
<br>
approach to the physics of the universe may be very very wrong.
<br>
<p>There is an interesting quote from one of the SETI conferences is something
<br>
to the effect of &quot;If you give a physicist long enough they can explain
<br>
*anything*.&quot;  So it seems to me it would pay to be careful in what one
<br>
believes.
