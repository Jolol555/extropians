Personally, I have always had a &quot;hunch&quot; (nothing substantial to back me up)
<br>
that crime rates are simply another &quot;fashion&quot; item.
<br>
For a time, being a &quot;bad-ass&quot; is popular among the youts of America. Then as
<br>
the next generation grows to replace them, it becomes unfashionable. The
<br>
next group to grow up sees them as a bunch of pansies and crime rates go up
<br>
again. I'm sure that if you dig deep enough you can find a correlation
<br>
between a type of clothing such as t-shirts, blue-jeans etc. or something
<br>
else and crime.
<br>
No doubt some politician will find this and claim that that item &quot;causes&quot;
<br>
crime, and when the next reduction comes along, the party in power will
<br>
claim that it was the result of their policies and use that as a basis for
<br>
re-election.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to actually chart this. My &quot;hunch&quot; also says
<br>
that crime reporting also varies from generatin to generation. When a couple
<br>
of boys spray-painted a garage or got into a fight, many years ago, it may
<br>
have never been reported simply because
<br>
the grown-ups (grups) would have thought of it as &quot;boys being boys&quot; and
<br>
handle the problem personally by contacting the parents, wheras now, someone
<br>
would promptly call the police to handle it.
<br>
<p>Any opinions on my &quot;hunch&quot;?
