Jeff Davis:
<br>
&lt;&lt;It's interesting how free-enterprise slash unfettered
<br>
capitalism slash free-marketeers suddenly change their
<br>
tune when the &quot;downturn in the business cycle&quot; hits
<br>
them personally.  If a conservative is a liberal who's
<br>
been mugged, then a born again liberal is a
<br>
conservative who's been &quot;downsized&quot;.  However, I'm not
<br>
here to gloat or do the &quot;I told you so&quot; dance.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Dance away, because pragmatism, or qualia is what makes things real. 
<br>
Economics or energy research, should be pragmatic, or perhaps utilitarian.
<br>
<p>Jeff Davis:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Regarding the idea that managers are somehow unworthy
<br>
because they run businesses but rarely build them: it
<br>
seems entirely reasonable to me that these are two
<br>
different specialties, running vs building.  At least
<br>
that's a theory I've heard somewhere.  Why not?  And
<br>
those skilled at one may not be as skilled at the
<br>
other.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The person who has made me aware of this condition is a lifelong small 
<br>
businessman, and this guy is, by most terms, successful financially. The two skills 
<br>
seem to be needed because otherwise we get this Mary Antionette mentality 
<br>
where one feels they can eternally get away with fiddling with other people's 
<br>
money. No retribution happens, so this encourages the greediest, not necessarilly 
<br>
the most inventive and productive. To be able to manage and grow a company are 
<br>
the same skills, because both are 80% people skills. Ass-licking, and 
<br>
spouting propaganda speeches seem to be what the Fart-500 corp schmucks do 75% of the 
<br>
time. Its sickening, and destructive, because their perceptions are so 
<br>
narrow, as to not see how their offshoring idiocies (for example) will eventually 
<br>
undermine their companies. Those that have some awareness, appear to plan for 
<br>
taking a golden parachute out before the shit hits the fan.
