Optimum Strategies for Creativity and Longevity

&nbsp;Subj:  Longevity Vs. Retirement Age 
<br>
<p>The pension funds in many large corporations (e.g., Boeing,
<br>
Lockheed Martin, AT&amp;T, Lucent Technologies, etc.) have 
<br>
been &quot;Over Funded&quot; because many &quot;late retirees&quot; who 
<br>
keep-on working into their old age and retire late after the 
<br>
age of 65 tend to die within two years after their retirements. 
<br>
In other words, many of these late retirees do not live long 
<br>
enough to collect all their fair shares of pension money such
<br>
that they leave a lot of extra-unused money in the pension 
<br>
funds resulting in the over-funded pension funds. 
<br>
<p>Dr. Ephrem provided the important results in the following
<br>
Table 1 and the associated chart from an actuarial study of life 
<br>
span vs. age at retirement. The study was based on the number 
<br>
of pension checks sent to retirees of Boeing Aerospace. 
<br>
<p>Table 1  Actuarial Study of life span vs. age at retirement.
<br>
<p>Age at Retirement     Average Age At Death 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;49.9                         86 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.2                         85.3 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;52.5                         84.6 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53.8                         83.9 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55.1                         83.2 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56.4                         82.5 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;57.2                         81.4 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58.3                         80 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59.2                         78.5 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60.1                         76.8 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;61                            74.5 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;62.1                         71.8 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63.1                         69.3 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64.1                         67.9 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;65.2                         66.8 
<br>
<p><p>Table 1 and the chart indicate that for people retired at the
<br>
age of 50, their average life span is 86; whereas for people 
<br>
retired at the age of 65, their average life span is only 66.8. 
<br>
An important conclusion from this study is that for every 
<br>
year one works beyond age 55, one loses 2 years of life span 
<br>
on average. 
<br>
<p>The Boeing experience is that employees retiring at age of 65
<br>
receive pension checks for only 18 months, on average, prior 
<br>
to death.  Similarly, the Lockheed experience is that employees 
<br>
retiring at age of 65 receive pension checks for only 17 months, 
<br>
on average, prior to death.
<br>
<p>Dr. David T. Chai indicated that the Bell Labs experience is 
<br>
similar to those of Boeing and Lockheed based on the casual 
<br>
observation from the Newsletters of Bell Lab retirees.  A 
<br>
retiree from Ford Motor told Dr. Paul Tien-Lin Ho that the 
<br>
experience from Ford Motor is also similar to those in Boeing 
<br>
and Lockheed. 
<br>
<p>The statistics shown in the Pre-Retirement Seminar in
<br>
Telcordia (Bellcore) indicates that the average age that 
<br>
Telcordia (Bellcore) employees start retirement is 57. 
<br>
Therefore, people who retire at the age of 65 or older are 
<br>
minority as compared to the number of early retirees. 
<br>
<p>The hard-working late retirees probably put too much stress
<br>
on their aging body-and-mind such that they are so stressed 
<br>
out to develop various serious health problems that forced 
<br>
them to quit and retire.  With such long-term stress-induced 
<br>
serious health problems, they die within two years after they 
<br>
quit and retire. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, people who take early retirements at the
<br>
age of 55 tend to live long and well into their 80s and beyond. 
<br>
These earlier retirees probably are either wealthier or more 
<br>
able to plan and manage their various aspects of their life, 
<br>
health and career well such that they can afford to retire early 
<br>
and comfortably. 
<br>
<p>These early retirees are not really idling after their early
<br>
retirements to get old. They still continue doing some work. But 
<br>
they do the work on the part-time basis at a more leisure pace 
<br>
so that they do not get too stressed out. Furthermore, they have 
<br>
the luxury to pick and chose the types of part-time work of real 
<br>
interest to them so that they can enjoy and love doing that &quot;fun&quot; 
<br>
work at a more leisure pace. 
<br>
<p>The late retirees are small in number, tend to die quickly after 
<br>
retirement and disappear from the population of old people
<br>
beyond the age of 70.  Late retirees, therefore, have very little 
<br>
weight on the statistical average life expectancy of the population 
<br>
of &quot;old people&quot; dominated by the early retirees. 
<br>
<p>Conclusion and Recommendations  - 
<br>
<p>When you get older, you should plan your career path and
<br>
financial matters so that you can retire comfortably at the age 
<br>
of 55 or earlier to enjoy your long, happy and leisure retirement 
<br>
life into your golden age of 80s and beyond. In retirement, you 
<br>
can still enjoy some fun work of great interest to you and of 
<br>
great values to the society and the community, but at a part-time 
<br>
leisure pace on your own term. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if you are not able to get out of the
<br>
pressure-cooker or the high-speed battleground at the age of 
<br>
55 and &quot;have&quot; to keep on working very hard until the age of 
<br>
65 or older before your retirement,  then you probably will die 
<br>
within 18 months of retirement. By working very hard in the 
<br>
pressure cooker for 10 more years beyond the age of 55, you 
<br>
give up at least 20 years of your life span on average.
