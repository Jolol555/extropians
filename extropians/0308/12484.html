<p>Ulysses sees Galactic Dust on the rise
<br>
<p>Since early 1992 Ulysses has been monitoring the stream of stardust flowing
<br>
through our Solar System. The stardust is embedded in the local galactic cloud
<br>
through which the Sun is moving at a speed of 26 kilometres every second. As a
<br>
result of this relative motion, a single dust grain takes twenty years to
<br>
traverse the Solar System. Observations by the DUST experiment on board Ulysses
<br>
have shown that the stream of stardust is highly affected by the Suns magnetic
<br>
field.
<br>
<p>In the 1990s, this field, which is drawn out deep into space by the out-flowing
<br>
solar wind, kept most of the stardust out. The most recent data, 
<br>
collected up to
<br>
the end of 2002, shows that this magnetic shield has lost its protective power
<br>
during the recent solar maximum. In an upcoming publication in the Journal of
<br>
Geophysical Research ESA scientist Markus Landgraf and his co-workers from the
<br>
Max-Planck-Institute in Heidelberg report that about three times more stardust
<br>
is now able to enter the Solar System.
<br>
<p>The reason for the weakening of the Suns magnetic shield is the increased solar
<br>
activity, which leads to a highly disordered field configuration. In the
<br>
mid-1990s, during the last solar minimum, the Suns magnetic field resembled a
<br>
dipole field with well-defined magnetic poles (North positive, South negative),
<br>
very much like the Earth. Unlike Earth, however, the Sun reverses its magnetic
<br>
polarity every 11 years. The reversal always occurs during solar maximum. Thats
<br>
when the magnetic field is highly disordered, allowing more 
<br>
interstellar dust to
<br>
enter the Solar System. It is interesting to note that in the reversed
<br>
configuration after the recent solar maximum (North negative, South positive),
<br>
the interstellar dust is even channelled more efficiently towards the inner
<br>
Solar System. So we can expect even more interstellar dust from 2005 onwards,
<br>
once the changes become fully effective.
<br>
<p>While grains of stardust are very small, about one hundredth the diameter of a
<br>
human hair, they do not directly influence the planets of the Solar System.
<br>
However, the dust particles move very fast, and produce large numbers of
<br>
fragments when they impact asteroids or comets. It is therefore 
<br>
conceivable that
<br>
an increase in the amount of interstellar dust in the Solar System will create
<br>
more cosmic dust by collisions with asteroids and comets. We know from the
<br>
measurements by high-flying aircraft that 40,000 tonnes dust from asteroids and
<br>
comets enters the Earths atmosphere each year. It is possible that the increase
<br>
of stardust in the Solar System will influence the amount of extraterrestrial
<br>
material that rains down to Earth.

The pictures above show cut-aways of where interstellar dust is concentrated in
<br>
the Solar System -- high concentration: red/yellow, low concentration:
<br>
blue/green (the planets are not shown). During solar minimum (top picture) most
<br>
interstellar dust can be found above or below the Sun, while at the solar
<br>
maximum (bottom picture) the dust is concentrated close to the Sun in the plane
<br>
of the planets' orbits. Copyright: ESA
