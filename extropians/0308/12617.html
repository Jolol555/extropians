</em><br>
<p>Well, Bill that cannot be a good argument in general: after all,
<br>
here on Earth itself there have been many &quot;unprecedented&quot;
<br>
developments, such as the beginning of life itself.  Also, please
<br>
specify whether you mean &quot;the visible universe&quot; or the whole
<br>
infinite universe.  But I will leave to Randall further analysis
<br>
of your arguments there.  Next you turn to Rafal:

<em>&gt; &gt; Basically, an r-strategist is a k-strategist in optimal

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This statement is incorrect. The fact that a few populations move from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one strategy to the other is well-known and much studied. Several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species have been studied which go through repeated and regular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population 'Boom and Bust' cycles. They start off as r-strategists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breed furiously. Next phase, they hit one of the limits, move to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; K-strategists and the population collapses. Then the cycle starts over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again.
</em><br>
<p>You may wish to comment upon the difference that happens at
<br>
the periphery of an expanding population versus what happens
<br>
in the interior.  At the periphery, why would k-strategists
<br>
evolve?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As a rule, populations DO NOT change from r-strategy to K-strategy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once a Z-strategy elephant - always a Z-strategy elephant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, once an r-strategy rat - always an r-strategy rat...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is most unlikely (I believe impossible) that a K-strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-singularity civilization will suddenly decide that a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival strategy is to breed like rats and swamp the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I wish that you would try harder to think of very advanced
<br>
life in other than terms relating to familiar species.
<br>
Future species will obviously be at least as malleable
<br>
and adaptable as humans have shown themselves to be.
<br>
<p>You wrote earlier
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems probable to me that an advanced civilization will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; K-strategy, monoculture population with no need or desire for rapid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproduction. (They may send out probes for curiosity's sake, but no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion).
</em><br>
<p>No way.  Advanced civilization will resemble---from the
<br>
outside---The Blob, all absorbing and all engulfing.
<br>
The term &quot;reproduction&quot; that I used was meant quite
<br>
abstractly---literally turning remote matter into 
<br>
intelligence something like one already is.  Not genes
<br>
and DNA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other alternative, of course, is as Lee originally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested, that we are actually the first intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species in our light cone.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that where all the evidence points at present?
<br>
Actually, I want to thank Rafal for bringing up in
<br>
a different post
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Have you read &quot;Burning the Cosmic Commons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolutionary Strategies for Interstellar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colonization&quot; by Robin Hanson?
</em><br>
<p>There are quite a number of productive places in that
<br>
essay to take off from
