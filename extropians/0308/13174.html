<p>
Many of us have seen those lists of nations
<br>
rated by various criteria: freedom, peacefulness,
<br>
charitable giving per capita, etc.  Many of the 
<br>
categories are subjective, so the results are 
<br>
actually a statement of the value system
<br>
of those who compile the ratings.
<br>
<p>One of these lists recently posted had a category
<br>
which caught my attention: the consumption of
<br>
natural resources per capita.  The west, and
<br>
particularly the U.S. generally does poorly, 
<br>
greedy resource devourers that we are.  
<br>
<p>Perhaps a better way to evaluate this is to add a 
<br>
category with positive points given for those 
<br>
nations which create unnatural resources.  For
<br>
instance, sand is a natural resource, but from
<br>
it is created computer chips, clearly an unnatural 
<br>
resource.  Iron ore is a natural resource, but
<br>
from it is created cars, bulldozers, road graders,
<br>
office towers, all manner of wonderfully unnatural
<br>
resources.  Coal and oil are natural resources, but 
<br>
when they are burned, a new substance is created, CO2,
<br>
which is a vital resource from the point of view 
<br>
of plant life.
<br>
<p>A ratio can be calculated: the amount of unnatural
<br>
resources created divided by the amount of natural 
<br>
resources consumed.  Calculate it per capita, total
<br>
as a nation, it really doesn't matter.  If viewed
<br>
in this manner, it becomes clear that those nations
<br>
which consume the fewest resources per capita produce
<br>
*practically nothing* in valuable unnatural resources.  
<br>
By this criterion, many if not most nations on this
<br>
planet score a big fat zero.  Japan, on the other
<br>
hand, would likely end up on the top, followed closely
<br>
by the U.S., Sweden, Germany, Australia, England,
<br>
Canada.  
<br>
<p>What do you suppose the greens would say about
<br>
this view of life?  How do you suppose the average
<br>
green would score in creation of unnatural resources?
