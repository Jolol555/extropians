</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;A quick Google finds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0818/p02s01-usju.html">http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0818/p02s01-usju.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And here's the report with the 5.6 million figure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/piusp01.htm">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/piusp01.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oddly enough, while it has all the data from the body of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CSM article, it doesn't appear to have anything to say about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US incarceration rates compared to the rest of the world.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why that is odd, it's the *US* department of Justice, not
<br>
the World Department of justice.  They put the information together, its
<br>
up to others to compare it.  Which is exactly what CS Monitor and the
<br>
'home office' does, or at least superficially did.  Interestingly...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Google suggests that a common citation for statistics on world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incarceration rates is the Home Office's World Prison Population List,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In which the USA takes the top spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Interesting that on page 4, at the bottom, it says 
<br>
<p>&quot;No information on; Iraq, Afghanastan, Bhutan, Laos, East Timor, and
<br>
North Korea&quot;
<br>
<p>And at the end of the paper
<br>
<p>&quot;The list has a number of weaknesses.  Its lacks information on 17
<br>
independent countries&quot;
<br>
<p>So, in other words, the US has the highest prison population in the
<br>
world, not counting the notoriously worst countries in the world, which
<br>
wont bother telling anyone what their prison population is.  Not
<br>
surprisingly, this is not mentioned once in the CS Monitor article.
<br>
<p>In doing some googling trying to find info on where some of the
<br>
countries that were listed came from, for example vietnam, I came across
<br>
this
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/G/GENERAL/GENERAL293N.PDF">http://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/G/GENERAL/GENERAL293N.PDF</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;But the fact remained that violations of political and civil rights,
<br>
for the most part, were most severe in the countries where domestic NGOs
<br>
were not allowed to operate: China, Vietnam, Burma, Bhutan, Brunei and
<br>
North Korea. Elsewhere, there were areas which were also effectively
<br>
closed to domestic and international human rights investigators,
<br>
including East Timor and parts of Irian Jaya, Tibet, and Khmer
<br>
Rouge-held zones of Cambodia.&quot;
<br>
<p>So where did the prison population figure for Vietnam come from, did
<br>
they just ask the &quot;Peoples Democratic Republic of Vietnam&quot; for a figure,
<br>
and were provided the figure of 77 in 100,000!  But who cares about
<br>
accuracy, as long as it makes the US look bad, right?
<br>
<p>Of China, it says 
<br>
<p>&quot;Wu Shishen, an editor in the domestic news department of Xinhua was
<br>
sentenced to life in prison for selling a Hongkong reporter an advance
<br>
copy of a speech by Party Secretary Jiang Zemin.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The Chinese government continued to arrest, detain and torture peaceful
<br>
critics and to interfere with freedom of expression, association,
<br>
assembly and religion. Releases of dissidents were carefully timed for
<br>
political impact, as exemplified by the release days before the Olympic
<br>
decision in September of writer and editor Wei Jingsheng after over
<br>
fourteen years of solitary confinement.&quot;
<br>
<p>Etc. etc.  The stories go on and on, for vietnam, laos, Burma...
<br>
<p>One wonders where they got the figures for Chinese imprisonment as well.
