</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sad, but what is to be done about this problem?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Depends, how big a problem is this actually? Is it more than 
<br>
just publicity chasing political opportunism and media baiting 
<br>
(or responding to media story bush beating) by CIS Director
<br>
Hollister or someone else I wonder? Disengaging the facts from
<br>
media speak is always something of an exercise and to be honest
<br>
I'm not really convinced its worth my taking the trouble in this case.
<br>
Is CI even looking for help or do they have everything under
<br>
control? 
<br>
<p>I am not a lawyer and I know less of the American legal system
<br>
than I do of the Australian system but a couple of points stick
<br>
out to me from this article and I recall a little backgrounding I did
<br>
on cryonics a few years ago.
<br>
<p>First there is a paper accessible from the cryonics site entitled
<br>
&quot;Declaration of Dr. Fahy&quot;, <a href="http://www.cryonics.org/fahy.html">http://www.cryonics.org/fahy.html</a>
<br>
where in California (not Michigan) &quot;the cryonics people won
<br>
the case (in the Superior Court) and the coroner was enjoined
<br>
against interfering with the cryonics operation.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I don't know if California and the Michigan have the same or
<br>
similar (ie. essentially duplicated) Departments of Consumer
<br>
and Industry Services, but if they do, or if they are not notably
<br>
different on point then my guess is that the Californian decision
<br>
should at least have persuasive power in Michigan. 
<br>
<p>Second, I have not drawn out the legislation or bylaws that
<br>
Hollister is apparently invoking, (what would be the point he
<br>
seems to refer to no particular clauses or legal points -
<br>
what references are made are made by the reporters, whom
<br>
Hollister may or may not be accurately represented by.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Hollister is quoted as &quot;expressing concern that people from 
<br>
around the world have invested their trust and finances into
<br>
this facility to preserve their bodies for eternity yet this facility
<br>
continues to knowingly operate outside the scope of the law&quot;.
<br>
<p>Well what a sweetie. That he in the state of Michigan, should
<br>
be so multinational in his &quot;concern&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;Operating outside the law&quot; is not necessarily the same
<br>
as &quot;operating illegally&quot; though many political spinners and 
<br>
media types would recognize that such a distinction may be
<br>
lost on many readers (and some reporters). 
<br>
<p>Consider if there is no legislation on the matter of having
<br>
a favourite color is one &quot;operating outside the law&quot; to have
<br>
a favourite color like blue? Does favoring blue mean one
<br>
is operating outside the law. Outside could mean the law 
<br>
has no jurisdiction on the matter.
<br>
<p>Third, unless the CI has said or Hollister and can show 
<br>
that the CI institute has promised to &quot;preserve ..bodies for
<br>
eternity&quot; (a statement which strikes me as a little surprising
<br>
having had some brief email contacts with Bob Ettinger a
<br>
few years ago - he did not strike me as that foolish), then
<br>
the implied deception - to preserve for eternity - is very 
<br>
much moot.
<br>
<p>And if as the reporter in this link says 
<br>
(STATE Orders Local Cryonics Institute To Close - WDIV, MI
<br>
<a href="http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/2434929/detail.html">http://www.clickondetroit.com/news/2434929/detail.html</a>  )
<br>
<p>&quot;The facility, .... is being ordered to preserve the bodies 
<br>
currently in its care; however, it will not be able to accept
<br>
any new contracts or bodies.&quot; How is such an &quot;order&quot; not
<br>
logically contradictory to the point against preservation being
<br>
made? 
<br>
<p>The same article goes on ...
<br>
<p>&quot;Hollister said CIS is encouraging the Cryonics Institute to
<br>
take the necessary steps to come in compliance with state law.
<br>
The Cryonics Institute may become licensed either as a funeral 
<br>
establishment or registered as a cemetery; however, current law
<br>
would prohibit the Cryonics Institute from being able to do both.
<br>
The law stipulates that bodies cannot be prepared at the scene
<br>
of a cemetery, however the institute could make arrangements
<br>
for the bodies to be prepared in a licensed funeral home, 
<br>
according to CIS.&quot;
<br>
<p>If I was at CI I'd want to see exactly what the state law said
<br>
rather than read about it in general terms in the media. I imagine
<br>
Bob Ettinger has that well covered. I'd also suspect that wiggle
<br>
room would be left in the definition of separating cemetery from 
<br>
funeral home (how much separation is enough etc?) and perhaps
<br>
even in the notion of what is a body - perhaps see the Fahy 
<br>
argument above. Hollister and co could well be just &quot;bending&quot;
<br>
with the prevailing political wind or responding to media story
<br>
making and CI may well respond accordingly.
<br>
<p>Of course, the media prefers stories that are more rather than
<br>
less dramatic and confrontational. And what better way to find
<br>
&quot;news&quot; in a quite period than to make it by muck raking on an
<br>
issue that seems to have become topical (with Sports Illustrated
<br>
and Ted whats-his-name - hey we're not all baseball fans).
<br>
<p>I can see lots of potential solutions and courses of action 
<br>
depending on details that are not included in the articles but 
<br>
there are also *lots* of other things to spend time on, so
<br>
seriously how big is the problem?
