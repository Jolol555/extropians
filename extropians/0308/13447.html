From: &quot;Greg Burch&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20Of%20Paroxysms%20and%20Politics%20(was%20would%20you%20vote%20for%20this%20man?)">gregburch@gregburch.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This list has just gone through a paroxysm of anger and hurt over
</em><br>
discussion
<br>
<em>&gt; of current political issues.  Before continuing with this thread, please
</em><br>
ask
<br>
<em>&gt; yourself whether this is the right forum for discussions of this sort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are literally thousands of places on the net to discuss contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political issues.  Other than those that bear DIRECTLY on the
</em><br>
transhumanist
<br>
<em>&gt; agenda, this isn't one of them.
</em><br>
<p>... then why are the authors listed at the Extropy Shop - those that may not
<br>
have a DIRECT bearing on the transhumanist agenda per se - have a
<br>
right-wing/libertarian bent?  If I were new to transhumanism and went to the
<br>
Extropian site for the first time, I would observe some semblance of
<br>
politics (and why not? it's difficult to separate humans from politics).
<br>
Except, the Extropian site is not impartial - otherwise, maybe H.G. Wells
<br>
would be represented along with Ayn Rand:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.extropy.org/shop/index.html">http://www.extropy.org/shop/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>There are many shades of transhumanism, and some of them bear directly on
<br>
its agenda:
<br>
<p>e.g. Transhumanist Socialism:
<br>
<a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/ug/greenrd/trans-soc.htm">http://www.lancs.ac.uk/ug/greenrd/trans-soc.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've given up on the idea of encouraging &quot;civil dialogue&quot; on contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political issues: There will always be people who will push the rhetorical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heat up beyond what a civil discussion forum can tolerate.  Draconian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policing of the list is a last resort.  So let me please enter a plea to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply leave off from discussion of the hot-button political and
</em><br>
ideological
<br>
<em>&gt; issues.
</em><br>
<p>I say, what we need here is more levity.
<br>
<p>Forgive me, as it may not have a direct bearing on the transhumanist agenda,
<br>
but Dave Barry once wrote ...:
<br>
&quot;The Democrats seem to be basically nicer people, but they have demonstrated
<br>
time and again that they have the management skills of celery. They're the
<br>
kind of people who'd stop to help you change a flat, but would somehow
<br>
manage to set your car on fire. I would be reluctant to entrust them with a
<br>
Cuisinart, let alone the economy. The Republicans, on the other hand, would
<br>
know how to fix your tire, but they wouldn't bother to stop because they'd
<br>
want to be on time for Ugly Pants Night at the country club.&quot;
