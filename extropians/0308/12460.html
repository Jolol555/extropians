Randall writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Robert wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But distributing ones intelligence across light years makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; essentially &quot;impossible&quot; for Lee to function as a connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence.  So you seem to be suggesting that &quot;Lee&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a socialist or a communist and that he is colonizing for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;good&quot; of the very loosely connected collective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By &quot;collectively&quot;, I meant &quot;summed over all entities with Leeness&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I'm sure that Lee can defend his own point of view better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I can,
</em><br>
<p>You are doing a *great* job, thanks!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and I only mentioned it as an example of how these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussions seem to go off track. :)  It appears that I shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have used the term &quot;collectively&quot;, since it's so close to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term &quot;collectivist&quot;, which isn't what I intended.  Nor was it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that I believe that Lee is interested (in this case) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distributing intelligence across lightyears.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.  Robert and many others have made it clear
<br>
that that's impossible.  Besides, given how slow light
<br>
travels, I have always thought that an integrated intelligence
<br>
probably can't be more than kilometers in size anyway
<br>
(depends on the kind of problems that it enjoys and the
<br>
gratification algorithms it executes).
<br>
<p>No---whether it is a Lee II or a Randall II or a Samantha II
<br>
or even a FriendlyAlien II, all the true copies of me wish
<br>
them well, and want to live in peace with them.  Hell, I even
<br>
want to live in peace with Osama, but he's got other ideas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; No, the point I have been trying to make (it seems like over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and over again) is that Lee II *cannot* provide any &quot;return
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on investment&quot; to Lee I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The thing you're missing here, Robert, is that Lee I doesn't care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (totally, at least) about ROI to Lee I, but about benefit to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person who is Lee, anywhere.  Or, hey, maybe I misunderstood Lee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you're right. :)  Only The Corbin can say.
</em><br>
<p>You're absolutely right, Randall.  It's a *big* priority
<br>
with me that the other Lee's get a lot of run time, even
<br>
if this unit (or we) have been out of contact with them
<br>
for eons.  But we must not lose sight of the fact that I
<br>
would like matter everywhere to be sentient, alive, and to
<br>
be enjoying life, even if I have no common history with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The only reason that Lee I would create Lee II is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out of some desire to propagate and Lee I would know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that propagation eventually has negative consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't matter that propagation eventually has negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences, *unless* you can prevent all propagation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by anyone, anywhere.  If anyone propagates, they will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disproportionately the ones that get to deal with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting problem.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, what is it about this aspect of evolutionary theory
<br>
(that evolution tautologically causes the predominance of
<br>
those who reproduce most) that is so hard for many to 
<br>
internalize?  As you and I keep saying, it only takes one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Sure you can have evolutionary drives but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any advanced civilization will have regulated those drives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (witness the declining populations in Japan and Europe).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now one might produce &quot;offspring&quot; if it were clear that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were not going to compete with you (i.e. the children of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advanced civilizations exit from the galaxy due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; temperature and thermodynamics reasons I have suggested).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A civilization that successfully regulates its own growth, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not that of others, if any, will not be highly represented at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a given late date.  Even if humans are the only existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences (and I would guess that we are), I see no reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why there wouldn't be escapees.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe your prose will succeed, Randall, where mine has failed.
<br>
We must be running up against very deeply held biases or very
<br>
deep emotions of some kind.
<br>
<p>Lee
