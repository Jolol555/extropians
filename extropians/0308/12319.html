<p>Popular diets: The good, the fad and the iffy
<br>
<p>A calorie is a calorie, no matter where it comes from. Most weight-loss diets
<br>
help you to restrict calories in one way or another. Ideally the new routine
<br>
gets you to eat less, eat healthier and exercise more. Seems simple, right?
<br>
It is, in theory. 
<br>
<p>Your weight remains stable when you eat the same number of calories you use
<br>
up. So, in theory, if you eat well and exercise — and in the process burn more
<br>
calories than you consume — you lose weight. 
<br>
<p>But in practice it's easy to run into roadblocks. Adopting healthy eating and
<br>
exercise habits can be difficult. It takes time and effort to work physical
<br>
activity into your daily routine. A good diet can be your road map to safe and
<br>
effective weight management. Conversely, a poor diet can leave you spinning your
<br>
wheels — or, even worse, pose serious health problems.
<br>
<p>Components of an effective weight-loss program must include:
<br>
<p>A healthy diet that helps you select, prepare and eat healthy foods. 
<br>
An exercise plan that helps you increase your activity throughout the day as
<br>
well as incorporate a more rigorous exercise period several times every week. 
<br>
<p>Weight-loss programs come in many forms today. Some prey on the desire for a
<br>
quick fix, and some of these diets do help you lose weight quickly — at least
<br>
for a while. But maintaining a healthy weight isn't something that most people
<br>
can manage quickly and maintain over the long haul. It's a process, and it can
<br>
be tough, but it's not impossible. If you're ready to commit to lifestyle
<br>
changes — eating healthier and being more physically active — then you're well
<br>
on your way to achieving a healthier weight. 
<br>
<p>Weigh the facts — avoid the fads
