<em>&gt;Alcor News Report:  8/13/03
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;=============================================================
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Renewed Ted Williams Controversy: An Interim Response
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Earlier this year Alcor News reported that we hired Larry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Johnson, a nationally certified paramedic, to manage our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;standby/transport work and emergency response capability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Larry came to us with excellent references and was actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;helpful in implementing a major revision of our meds kits. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;participated in our March training sessions and also helped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to train paramedics in Phoenix and Florida. Larry became an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alcor member and made no secret of this. He told a CBS TV
</em><br>
<em>&gt;news team from Los Angeles that he had always wanted to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the future, and he seemed to feel that cryonics would help
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him to get there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In two cases, Larry made a decisive difference by giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emergency guidance over the phone. He helped to minimize
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ischemic damage and made a radical difference to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condition of the cryopatients in these cases. We were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impressed by his assistance generally, and were glad to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him at Alcor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Unfortunately Larry seemed to feel unhappy with some aspects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Alcor. He had come to us from a very large, well-funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paramedic facility where he had been better compensated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Apparently he nursed a grudge to such an extent that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provided a reporter at Sports Illustrated with confidential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information which seemed calculated to damage Alcor as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as possible. The news item was picked up by The Associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Press and triggered reports from sources such as The New
</em><br>
<em>&gt;York Times and The Arizona Republic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We were astonished and dismayed that a nationally certified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paramedic would behave in such a way, without any significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provocation that we are aware of. We had done everything we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could to get to know Larry and verify that he was an ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person whom we could trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fortunately Alcor has accumulated some redundancy among its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;field team members during the past year. We can still respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well in an emergency. In the meantime, in reply to some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Larry Johnson's allegations, we are providing the news media
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with information explaining that our procedures are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formulated to minimize damage, not create it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In particular, the damage caused by fracturing when a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vitrified cryopatient is cooled to liquid-nitrogen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temperature is small compared with the cellular damage that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used to occur using glycerol as a cryoprotectant. While we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;won't be entirely happy until the day when we achieve zero-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damage cryopreservation, we are absolutely convinced that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;repair of simple fractures will be easy compared with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reconstruction of cellular debris that used to be caused by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ice formation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, when we use a perforator (a standard medical tool) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our operating room to create two small burr holes in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;skull, this is a precaution enabling us to inspect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surface of the brain during cryoprotective perfusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Observation of the brain is a safety measure to reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;risk of edema. Here again, we tolerate a small amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damage in the interests of avoiding much greater damage. (A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;burr hole can be repaired even with today's medicine.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Finally we must emphasize, contrary to news reports, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alcor has never collected &quot;DNA samples&quot; from its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryopatients. Obviously Alcor has no need to collect &quot;DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;samples,&quot; since a neuropatient already contains billions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DNA molecules. We may collect venous effluent samples during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the perfusion of a cryopatient, but the purpose of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;samples is to evaluate blood chemistry via standard lab
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So far as we can tell, Larry Johnson took some of Alcor's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property away with him when he disappeared without warning at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the end of the weekend of August 9th and 10th. During the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preceding weeks he recorded conversations with Alcor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;employees without notifying them or seeking their permission,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and he probably viewed confidential documents. We will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taking appropriate action. Alcor must make a clear statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it will not be intimidated by the threat of bad press
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and will not tolerate gross violations of its standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nondisclosure agreement by employees or ex-employees.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We will provide additional updates when we have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant news to report. Currently we have been unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reach Larry Johnson via phone or email, despite repeated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempts. If he has any statement to make regarding our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;description of what we believe he did, we invite his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;response.
