<p>
During a discussion, I believe between Spike and Randy,
<br>
comments being made included:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;More than 1000/acre generally.  You need about 40 acres to live on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that's 40,000.  I happen to have it, but then I make good money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;MOST&quot; people are negative in the cash arena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep. THat is one thing I have noticed about some of the people on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list--either they are all rich (Natasha seems to think many are), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think everyone is like them, or else they have totally bought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into--and never emerged from-- the dotcom-stock market bubblethink of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the late 90s. Or both....
</em><br>
<p>I believe the 40 acres number may be using &quot;typical&quot; agricultural
<br>
practices.  You might want to consider reading &quot;Square Foot Gardening&quot;
<br>
by Mel Bartholomew (1981) (seems to also be a PBS series on the topic).
<br>
<p>I would like to see someone cite some Google references on the actual
<br>
land area required to produce 2500 calories per day.  (There seems
<br>
to be a lot of hand waving going on here).
<br>
<p>I also do not believe that Natasha thinks most list members are &quot;rich&quot;.
<br>
However there are some list members who can at least &quot;afford&quot; to spend
<br>
a couple of hours a day online -- but this may not be too different
<br>
from spending a couple of hours a day watching television (which seems
<br>
to be feasible for many people in the U.S.).
<br>
<p>I think one thing missing in the discussion is what happens in various
<br>
regional areas as we concentrate the houses in ever-expanding (cheaper?)
<br>
suburbs while concentrating the jobs in core centers.  An ever increasing
<br>
fraction of time and money must go into transporting oneself from the
<br>
far flung suburbs to the core centers.  I knew people that would spend
<br>
one or two hours (each way) commuting from the North Bay to the South
<br>
Bay.  Seattle is rapidly becoming similar.
<br>
