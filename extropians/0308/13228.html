Intellectual property is a related and interesting aside, but...
<br>
<p>Isn't it one of the Seven Habits to seek first to understand...

<em>&gt; &gt; This thread strikes an interesting cord for me. In my opinion one of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that over time natural resources, i.e. land, slowly ends up in the hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a few. Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a few very rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; population. For an in-depth exploration of one way to solve this pop over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to www.henrygeorge.org and do some reading.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not so sure.  Dole doesn't buy land in Nebraska because one generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot grow pinapples there.  The land they own in Hawaii may be enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply due to constraints on how many pinapples one can market.  Refer back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the conversation with comments by Damien and others regarding tariffs on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agricultural products.  Even if you owned the land in a lower cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing &quot;state&quot; one might not be able to sell the products (so it makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no sense to own the land).  If this argument held together people would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snapping up land in northern Canada and Russia and using genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering to produce crops that would grow there.  Or one would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive efforts to build desalination plants and pipelines to supply the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. southweast with fresh water.  And of course there is North Africa and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Mid-east.  Yet one doesn't see efforts of that nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead one sees a greater concentration of &quot;wealth&quot; in the hands of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who own the &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; and &quot;human resources&quot;, e.g. IBM, Intel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  But one only owns the IP for 20 years and the human resources are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally free to move about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;land&quot; is ultimately important if we get into a massive population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth situation (say a world population of 20-100 billion).  But there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are solutions to this -- from more efficient agricultural methods (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mark Walker's recent post) to solar power satellites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is relatively accepted by economic theorists that as &quot;natural resources&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are exhausted that substitutions occur.  I have not looked at the web site,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but if it does not examine (in detail) substitution phenomena, then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't have a grasp of the &quot;big picture&quot;.
