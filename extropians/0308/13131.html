-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Nicq MacDonald
<br>
<p>Alright.  Damien posted a message reporting on how many people are
<br>
incarcerated in the US.  This is a major concern for many people here
<br>
and abroad.  Why does America have a higher crime rate than the rest of
<br>
the industrialized world?...-Nicq MacDonald
<br>
<p>Nicq, do you know for sure that this is the case?  It
<br>
could be that the U.S. is better at catching the
<br>
scoundrels who commit crimes.  (I mean real ones,
<br>
not mere drug possessors.)  That is the direction I 
<br>
hope to see technology take all societies all over 
<br>
the world: that they get better at catching the real
<br>
criminals.  spike
