<p>
Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to address any specific issue you raised.  I don't have 
<br>
all the answers and I am just as mystified as most on this thread.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe my discussion of this thread began with the two predictions 
<br>
of first the Singularity and second a new Renaissance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular both of those seem to be powered by the mobilization of 
<br>
under utilized GT (top 5% of the Bell Curve for Intelligence)  I gave some of 
<br>
my sources for believing that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the general discussion we have had as beneficial for this 
<br>
reason.  There is a great deal of evidence that the GT are increasingly being 
<br>
recruited to operate and manage the laboratories, workshops and boardrooms of our 
<br>
high tech economy.  Put in simple terms those GT are us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there is some observations that the GT are having an 
<br>
increasing number of boardroom wars as they wrest control of corporations from the old 
<br>
money.  I can't document where I read that.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But increasingly it is the class of people you see around you at this 
<br>
site that are making the leadership decisions in our society.  Look at Bill 
<br>
Clinton (include the group of associates he has) and tell me what he is but an 
<br>
example of a GT that found a way to accumulate power.  I am not taking sides on 
<br>
his philosophy just pointing out that he is a highly intelligent man that 
<br>
gained power because others needed someone like him -- so he took over.  Arnold 
<br>
S. seems to be another GT gaining power and wealth.  Some will think he is a 
<br>
simple muscle head but I say reserve your opinion until you dig out his academic 
<br>
record.  On a lesser plane the same is happening all around us.  As far back 
<br>
as the 60s I was working for inherited money that was trying to operate a 
<br>
small manufacturing business without the intelligence to do so.  Eventually they 
<br>
were forced out of the business world.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the world economy my guess is that we are going into at 
<br>
least a Renaissance and yes there will be turmoil.  Jobs and markets will be 
<br>
unsettled for a long time to come.  But it looks like the GT are going to 
<br>
replace a lot of the old crowd just as the merchants and scholars replaced the 
<br>
nobility in the last Renaissance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the question of the Singularity and the effect of AI -- 
<br>
but my head hurts thinking about it.
<br>
Ron h.
