<em>&gt;&gt; Why go to Middle Earth when there is another Earth? :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are two very easy answers to that question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, there is no &quot;magic&quot; on Mars (at least to my knowledge) --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. no &quot;one ring&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>But there are rumours that there exists a backdoor or exploit in all the
<br>
Red Era nanotech that would give the wielder power over the solettas, the
<br>
Marinovska plants, the unageing nanoists - everything. It is said to have
<br>
been compiled on top of Pavonis Mons by the Chief Areologist but was lost
<br>
after the Battle of Tharsis when rouge memeticists ambushed the bearer
<br>
somewhere along Coprates Chasma :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As much as I admire the landscapes of Mars -- they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce the emotional attachments that Middle Earth does.
</em><br>
<p>That is an interesting issue. Could it be that we have terrestrial
<br>
landforms so strongly imprinted in our brains that we won't perceive
<br>
grandeur (beyond the initial wow!) in an alien landscape? Maybe it is true
<br>
for us, but I would be surprised if Mars-born children saw it the same way
<br>
(&quot;Earth mountains are so *squat*! And that horrible blue sky color!&quot;)
<br>
Brains are plastic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Seriously Anders, now that you have resolved the issue of a PhD,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the next question becomes *when* will Anders get a girlfriend,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a boyfriend, or *something* other than the &quot;landscapes&quot; of Mars?).
</em><br>
<p>The real answer is of course that my SO at any moment is my current
<br>
project. Right now it is martian landscapes, a few weeks back it was
<br>
minimal surfaces and in a few weeks it could be astrobiology. I like to
<br>
play the field.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With respect to Mars, you will have to up the emotional significance --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise its on the &quot;to-do&quot; list for dismantlement.  (Computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usefullness trumps how &quot;pretty&quot; it may be -- we can *always* construct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things much prettier (in virtual or &quot;real&quot; reality)).
</em><br>
<p>In my setting, there was actually a political conflict between the
<br>
terraformers and Dysonistas about the division of the mass and energy of
<br>
the solar system. In the end the Cruithne Accords of 2136 (attached below)
<br>
settled the issue (most ended up in the Dyson of course).
<br>
<p>In reality the issue will decided by the speed things go software after
<br>
large-scale space colonisation occurs. If the Introdus begins early there
<br>
will not be many who have formed strong emotional ties to Mars (and humans
<br>
form emotional ties to *anything* they are close to for more than a few
<br>
minutes ;-) and few will object to optimizing things. If the Introdus is
<br>
late, then there will be people opposing dismantling of their
<br>
&quot;homeworlds&quot;, and much will depend on respect for property rights and
<br>
relative willingness to compromise. The accords below might actually be a
<br>
good example of such a compromise. It is not unlikely that the posthumans
<br>
were thinking long term here: sooner or later the Homo sapiens cultures
<br>
would come around anyway, and then dismantling could be done with no
<br>
quarrels. They can wait for total optimization a few millennia.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>The Cruithne Accord
<br>
<p>1.	Earth and Mars, with their respective natural satellite systems and
<br>
space within these systems out to their L2 points, are entitled to 1400
<br>
and 606 W/m^2 respectively (99% of natural solar output as measured June
<br>
2136) or enough augmented solar input necessary to keep their climate
<br>
within the standard parameters of the 2120-2136 period, whichever is the
<br>
largest. The spectral characteristic of the solar radiation is not to
<br>
deviate markedly from a stellar blackbody spectrum. Other regions of the
<br>
solar system are left open to exploitation.
<br>
<p>2.	All polities outside the Dyson sphere are entitled to a hemispherical
<br>
4K sky entropy sink and no more entropy influx than the June 2136 standard
<br>
sun.
<br>
<p>3.	The resources of the Earth and Mars systems are left under control of
<br>
their local polities (the NEO Adhoc and UN of Earth, MTN of Mars) or
<br>
successor polities to these.
<br>
<p>4.	The Mars system polity is acknowledged as owner of current MTN mining
<br>
outposts, the bodies they are located on and masses in transit from and to
<br>
these, as well as an additional 1e23 kg of mass from as yet unallocated
<br>
mass.
<br>
<p>5.	The Earth system is acknowledged as owner of current mining outposts
<br>
based on Earth or NEO economies, the bodies they are located on and masses
<br>
in transit from and to these, as well as an additional 1e23 kg of mass
<br>
from as yet unallocated mass.
<br>
<p>6.	The Dyson community is acknowledged as owner of currently designated
<br>
Dyson or Trophe-Posthuman habitats and systems, the bodies they are
<br>
located on and masses in transit from and to these.
<br>
<p>7.	Unallocated mass and energy beyond these accords are to be distributed
<br>
by a first-come-first-served basis according to the Revised Outer Space
<br>
Treaty of 2104.
<br>
<p>8.	The use of autonomously self-replicating non-citizen systems that can
<br>
survive in free space is prohibited.
<br>
<p>9.	If a conflict about these resources, the proper division of a multiply
<br>
colonised body or the proper interpretation of these accords occurs, all
<br>
parties defer to the reconvention of the Cruithne Summit or delegate
<br>
authority.
<br>
<p>Note: The Cruithne Accord process delegated a body allocation court to
<br>
settle the issues related to the Jupiter moons, Juno and WK3934. The body
<br>
allocation court formally remains in service for the future located at
<br>
Cruithne.
<br>
<p>Signatories

<br>
Interests and ratified by Main Cluster policy future market to p=1e-13)
