Samantha:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Oil is too bloody useful to simply burn for power even if you could stop 
<br>
being 
<br>
dependent on very politically messy MidEast sources. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We need to focus on the fact that most of petroleum is converted into 
<br>
gasoline and diesel fuel for transportation, not power for electrcity or even 
<br>
industrial production. Hence, it was never &quot;freeze in the dark&quot;, even during the twin 
<br>
1970's oil shocks--that was just media BS.
<br>
Because there are vast hydrocarbon amounts in the Gulf of Mexico, the west 
<br>
coast of Africa, the shores off Brazil, that are not yet as cheap as Persian 
<br>
Gulf, Brent crude, and light crude; we will be having repeats of this discussion 
<br>
for 70 years to come! So much for M. King Hubbert's forecasts. We haven't even 
<br>
discussed 1.7 trillion b.o.e of heavy oil in Alberta, or 2.6 trillion b.o.e. 
<br>
of pertoleum in Venezuala's Orinoco basin. (sigh!)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Well, I've looked forward for awhile to paying off the Pontiac Grand Prix.  
<br>
It 
<br>
gets an average 24.9 mpg.  Not terrible but I am seriously considering 
<br>
trading it in for a hybrid like the Prius.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Doing one's part to conserve, helps do one thing. Liberate us from Wahabbi 
<br>
influence. This is good if one is opposed to religion and state forming to 
<br>
produce something like nuclear weaponry-guerilla warfare. I have heard that Prius's 
<br>
are poor in the snow because they are small and light. I would advise anyone 
<br>
to drive what they can afford and enjoy; in light of what geologists tell us. 
<br>
And, yes, there is that Carbon dioxide concern--which is another matter, 
<br>
entirely.
