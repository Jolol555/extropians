<p>I don't think that is going to work Aubrey.  Is it know for example
<br>
that existing stomach enzymes don't break down the materials that you
<br>
mention?  The problem might end up being a lack of specificity or an
<br>
inability to work at &quot;normal&quot; PH.  In which case I don't think having
<br>
more enzymes is going to do the trick -- it seems unlikely that nature
<br>
would have evolved enzymes to deal with the specific materials but rather
<br>
enzymes that are capable of breaking specific types of bonds.  In which
<br>
case their use might produce rather nasty side effects.
<br>
<p>One might have to resort instead to &quot;directed evolution&quot; of the type
<br>
that Maxygen does to get enzymes with the desired specificity.  Or
<br>
finally one might just have to do the enzyme tweeking &quot;by hand&quot; as
<br>
was done to several of the DNA polymerases to get them to function
<br>
more effectively in sequencing applications.
<br>
<p>I think one may need to devote more attention to what lipofuscin really is
<br>
(perhaps to the extent that they have studied what amyloid is) before
<br>
one can effectively begin to take it apart.
