Omard picks up our somewhat lengthy thread with a second
<br>
bite and writes:
<br>
<p>---------
<br>
<p>But just to briefly recap. I am trying to argue (despite views to
<br>
the contrary from many intelligent philosophers like Russel)
<br>
that it may in fact be possible to derive a moral or ethical
<br>
code on the basis of a handful of universal truths which are
<br>
<p>a) the all (effectively all in the moral universe) humans have
<br>
some propensity to reason,
<br>
b) that all humans by nature are born in a state of such 
<br>
dependency that they cannot even lift their head to feed so
<br>
they are by nature at least predisposed to be social. i.e.. they
<br>
need others or have needed others at some stage to survive.
<br>
<p>c) I am arguing that the simplifying principle for developing a
<br>
moral code is that the essential self interest of each individual,
<br>
that they perceive the universe from a necessarily self centric
<br>
position cannot be denied.
<br>
<p>d) I don't claim that moral codes remove the need for moral
<br>
judgements just that a good moral code (one that acknowledges
<br>
these principles) helps inform moral judgements in real time 
<br>
better than a poor one (like the 10 commandments, or utilitarianism
<br>
or any other code on offer) and in the end each of us must 
<br>
make moral judgements ourselves -we must each follow the 
<br>
maxim &quot;to thine ownself be true&quot;.
<br>
<p>Ergo my argument comes down I think to the notion that
<br>
if we were to teach children that they are rational and social
<br>
and that they ought not accept challenges to their self interest
<br>
other than through the process of reasoned compromises for
<br>
a net gain we would have the basis of a more enlightened society.
<br>
Key to this notion is that belief has no place, belief is contradictory
<br>
to reasoning and clear thinking and that when intelligent people 
<br>
use the word belief they usually mean it as a form of shorthand 
<br>
for &quot;this is my current working hypothesis&quot;, or alternatively, they
<br>
are not at that moment being particularly rational or intelligent.
<br>
Further language and participation in the social stock of 
<br>
knowledge flows from our capacity to reason not from belief.  
<br>
Belief qua belief then in this system is anti-social and 
<br>
dysfunctional as is altruism.
<br>
<p>To be clear I would not ban the use of the word belief I would
<br>
leave it as a useful means for numskulls to continue to identify
<br>
themselves as such and allow them to continue to shortchange
<br>
their reasoned (or otherwise) arguments in political discourses
<br>
in front of audiences. 
<br>
<p>This is just a summary. Its a long thread :-)
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Whether it would in fact yeild the best outcome for

<em>&gt; &gt; not knowable to you at the time you decide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I would say that they are; I would say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only reason to willing self-delude yourself via fantasy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or whatever is specifically because you have examined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  the outcomes and decided that reality sucked and you could do better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;I see. You are interchanging fantasy and self-delusion. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to think of fantasy as suspension of disbelief. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows one is doing it and one is doing it for fun.&lt;/snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; === ... and here we continue ====
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would say that you would end up having to constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (subconsciously) moniter reality to decide when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would come out of ur protective insanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Now thats the moral code. The reason for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral code is that usually judgements will be required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in real life which one cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anticipate and the better, the more sophisticated your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral code the better, (the more enlightened) your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; judgement of your own best interests will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; again I balk at the requirement for a sophisticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral code; you can have an incredibly simple moral 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; code; but apply it through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use of a sophisticated world view (ergo ur judgement).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale (the simplest) may [elect] not do something that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good for society in general but for far more basic reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a person who is reasoning at level 5.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; But the higher up in the levels one goes the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels o[f] abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code. I would think that a person would have a hard time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having a [sufficiently] complex moral code without having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the ability to use language for instance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; &quot;But the higher up in the levels one goes the more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels or abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code&quot;... Exactly my point :) this is what I would term a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated world-view.  You understand why things are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and how they're stated affects the outcomes...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Our leaders must make judgements that will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  impacts on lives other than their own. The more of us that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are reasoners and critical thinkers and the fewer of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us that are mere believers the better (the healthier) we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be as a society in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; depends :)  there are uses for followers (believers);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for instance, I would not necessarily want to run a committee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of reasonerss and critical thinkers :) but I would love to chair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one where there was one or two other reasons, and the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  were followers :)
</em><br>
<p>Could it be your experience to date is coloring your preferences
<br>
here? Followers, believers, are not hard to find. If you want 
<br>
people to just follow instructions then, acquire some skills and
<br>
you'll find them. But the projects that are really worth doing,
<br>
the ones on a grand scale. Say extending human life are likely
<br>
to require the coordinated efforts of many bright people who 
<br>
may themselves be able to bring followers in their train.
<br>
<p>Hey votes still count but not everyone gets to decide what
<br>
the policy choices are that they vote on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think btw, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature establishes the proportion of leaders to followers...
</em><br>
<p>To an extent. There are various theories of leadership. Personally
<br>
I take a situational approach. Sometimes I lead, sometimes I
<br>
follow, sometimes I'd be laisse fair, sometimes in military situations
<br>
I'd be more authoritarian. Its horses for courses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and I do dispute ur choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to hallucinate;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ever hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of self-hypnosis?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; No. I am an open minded sceptic when it comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conventional hypnosis. I have never experienced it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and those that I have seen ostensibly hypnotised on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage seemed to me to be substantially &quot;hamming&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or playing it up for the attention. I think some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us sometimes like not having to be analytical all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time and to have others tell us what to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and just follow alone can be pleasant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; trust me, hypnosis is real, and very VERY effective :)
</em><br>
<p>I've heard it varies from person to person. I'll trust you that
<br>
it is not a complete crock :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you can get urself into a deep enough trance, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; post-hypnotic suggestions that trigger when you wake... including the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; post hypnotic suggestion to renew itself until you are rescued.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can cause hallucinations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a deep enough trance btw.  And thats not even calling upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of mystics, or people who have sufficiently advanced manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; techniques...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I don't know if I can get into a trance as you put it. I guess I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can its just not something I am very familiar with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; you should check it out :) their are some qualitative tests
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to see whether or not you are hypnotizeable to any such degree.
</em><br>
<p>If I could do them without giving another person power over my 
<br>
mind maybe I'd try em. Otherwise I don't think I'd be good at
<br>
cooperating. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It may also be a comfort issue with you :)  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (technically) ways to get around your mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocks... read some material on hypnotic inductions for patients
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  who are subconsciously resisting hypnosis :)
</em><br>
<p>All links and book refs I'd be curious in at least. But I don't
<br>
have a burning desire to be hallucinated I'm kind of fond of what
<br>
I think is my capacity for clear thinking - why would I want some
<br>
one to mess with it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I suppose when it comes to my mind I am a bit of a control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freak, I don't like it when the captain is not on the bridge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; depends on what the crew's going to do when ur away :)
</em><br>
<p>Sure. But still what would be in it for me?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; I find this conclusion (Bertrand Russell's) powerful, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous and deeply unsatisfying so I am keen to have at it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I was just telling my little sister yesterday about one of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; classical issues in my life (at one point during my younger years); 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; what point does being too intelligent start to harm you (the classic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; form being, if you could trade intelligence for gauranteed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; happiness, would you do it)... most intelligent people say no; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; think the really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent people though, when they consider it, say yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; I think this is pure speculation. Would a less intelligent you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; does it make a difference if you are gauranteed to be happy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; If you think so there may be possibilites for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to chart a life for yourself that involves more happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and less intellect. But personally I don't think so. How do you aim at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness without identifying something that will make you happy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Happiness is not itself a thing that can be persued.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; ergo my point :) if you can't gaurantee happiness by method of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence, and some mythical blue genie (whom to the best of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abilities to discern is capable of granting) is willing to gaurantee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ur happiness at the cost of your intelligence than any sane, rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person of sufficient intellect would not think twice.  This assumes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that everyone wants to be happy[maiximized utility table]... which I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't think is an unreasonable...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;I must be failing to follow what you mean by maximizing your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility table or something because it still seems to me that happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot really be a target that one aims at it is a consequence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arises as a desired and hoped for side effect of something else one aims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; theoretically [NOT physically] everyone has an internal weight to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimuli;  maximizing ur utility table means successfully selecting an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from all available actions that maximizes ur utility for that set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions... ergo happiness :) ergo all ur actions are incidental as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are all targeted towards maximizing ur utility table :)
</em><br>
<p>Sorry still don't get it. Can you break it down further. I know what
<br>
utility (usefulness) is and what a table is. But your comments about
<br>
&quot;selecting an action form a set of actions aimed at maximising happiness
<br>
just doesn't seem correct.
<br>
<p>Let me ask do you see this utility table as a construct one makes or
<br>
an evolutionary artifact one inherits? 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe in regret as an emotion :)
</em><br>
<p>I miss you point. Regret *is* a word. Prima facie it has a referent
<br>
or maybe more than one. Have you never experienced regret?
<br>
Do you think regret is not experienced by others? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; course, assumes that people intuitively seek to maximize their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; utilities, and said maximization of utility defines a state of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; happiness [which is, I think, reasonable]...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; I don't.  I think its premature at best and problematic at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worst. One cannot be happy without a cause. Happiness per 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; se is not persuable. Pleasure is. Lesser levels of sentience are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But I doubt these are what appeal to you as an alternative.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; ..... The potential to persuade using the sociability aspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *is* far stronger when individuals are [relatively] powerless [like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; children] and my point is that the all those who are mortal are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now becoming *aware* that they possess a poor form of wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and power if it can't extend their life and health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; ... and these are the only people you're interested in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approaching?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Yeah only all those who are *mortal*  and have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I was referring to the wealth and power aspect :)
</em><br>
<p>From a practical point of view, bearing in mind I have only so
<br>
much time, and I do have particular objectives, yes all things 
<br>
being equal I prefer to persuade and may allies amongst the
<br>
powerful. Its quicker. And if they are offside they can slow things
<br>
down. But there are different types of power. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; There is an opportunity there to get them to revisit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the social compact. But these cagey old survivers will not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fall for bs. When arguments are put to them that are not in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their interest they will not buy into them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; its been my experience that people who are very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wealthy generally don't  give a shit about social compact.
</em><br>
<p>It's not been mine. Not as a generalisation. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  They got (and preserve) their wealth at the cost of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  individuals...  I would agree that you need to put it in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terms that involve greed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Well self interest will do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; in most cases, it will; in some cases (where the agents lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision), it doesn't :)
</em><br>
<p>As a rule the successful folk, don't lack vision across the board. 
<br>
And one does not need to persuade all of them to make progress.
<br>
My point is that if you approach them with a real answer to their
<br>
*fair* question, what is in it for me, you are likely to get further.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; So in my view a moral argument cannot be put to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a rich or powerful individual unless it is couched in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; offering *something* for them. We live in an historic period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In this  period it might be possible to promote a policy of more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life for all or [posit that the alternative may be] more life for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; none.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; good luck getting the rich to give a shit about the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (past the ones  making off with their valuables)....
</em><br>
<p>I think luck has nearly nothing at all to do with it. My point is
<br>
a *moral* rich man *is* a poor man.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; No I'd aim to get the rich to care more effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the rich by recognizing their relationship with the poor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  My emphasis is not be charitable to the poor; my emphasis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is on how would you life be better if the poor were not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  poor? If they [the poor] had more to loose. If they [the poor]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were able to cooperate with you to make both you and them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  wealthier in absolute terms rather than relative terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; if they acknowledge a relationship with the poor... 
</em><br>
<p>I'm at a loss with that remark :-) How could they not acknowledge
<br>
a &quot;relationship&quot;. If they don't I can point out several in seconds.
<br>
<p>The poor vote with one vote each just like the rich. They can
<br>
even vote themselves money. Don't confuse the relatively poor
<br>
with the stupid. Democracies are the result not of the wealthy
<br>
and powerful conceeding rights to the masses they are a point
<br>
of rough equilibrium between power groups. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Would you rather be healthy and active at 130 or have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very expensive funeral and a prestigiously looking burinal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plot at 80?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; the former :)  I (personally) am not arguing with ur goal :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I just think rich people won't see it ur way (as a win-win 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution).
</em><br>
<p>I don't need to persuade all of them. Just the ones who want to
<br>
be still richer in absolute life terms. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; The alternative may be cabals of the powerful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; working to 'immortalise' themselves. Such a scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may restart &quot;history&quot; whose demise was greatly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exaggerated.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; .....I would not be part of a cabal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that sought to hold back life-extending technologies...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think all medical advances should be shared equally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without regard to effort involved (or contributed) by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  individual parties.
</em><br>
<p>That's nice but we gotta be practical. You do vaccinate
<br>
the doctors before you send them into a plague, rather
<br>
than make them take their chances in a lottery. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Further those who do not endeavour to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; understand themselves, what manner of creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are, are not going to be in a position to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; what the most optimal compromises for them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; when compromises need to be made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I've met several people who are extremely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; intuitively, but  unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to verbalize (form coherent sentences) expressing their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; viewpoints...they just know what is right for them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and what is not...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; how does your system encompass them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; They learn to reason and they learn to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; language to persuade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They learn to understand what they want. This gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them the best chance to make their way and improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their situation as they go. It does not guarantee them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;omd&gt; and if the overall performance of this new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system ends up being worse than their intuitive model?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  what then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I have no magic. If my moral code is adopted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by others it will because they see merit in it. If they see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  merit in it and I see merit in it I'm prepared to work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the assumption that their is merit in it. - That a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  simplistic but this thread is very long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; in other words, you are willing to accept a less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than perfect moral system :) for the sake of efficiency...
</em><br>
<p>No I'm prepared to take on board constructive criticism,
<br>
integrate it and build a still stronger system as a result. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; my only concern, really, is to point out that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be arbitrarily limiting yourself :) and wouldn't it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suck if it took an intuitive person to find the solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amidst all the noise...
</em><br>
<p>If the intuitive person could communicate the solution
<br>
with language that's great, I'm not anti-intuition, if not,
<br>
they don't have a solution I'm interested in, because it
<br>
cannot be socialised. I'd regarded it as just another
<br>
belief system. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;omd&gt; work smarter, not harder has always been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my motto...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Makes sense. But leveraging your efforts with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  others can be a particularly effective way of working 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; I would have been happy to point out to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unibomber that he was born social, so much so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he couldn't raise his head to feed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; granted :) but that doesn't really nullify the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that he did become extremely antisocial afterwards...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Granted. But there is value in knowing why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and how. The value is in the power to identify route
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; causes that can be changed. Lets go for the disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not the symptom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; assuming that it is a disease, and that it is a root
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cause to be attacked...
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But a better word than disease would have been a
<br>
dysfunction or a suboptimal worldview for achieving his
<br>
enlightened best interest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Then I'd ask him where his sociability ended.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It could be an insightful conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; probably when he realized it was a losing game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for his utility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tables...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Or he may discover that he's been shortchanging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his own self  interest with a suboptimal utility table.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ... if he was shortchaning his own self-interest :) we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can keep going in circles if you like :)
</em><br>
<p>No, I won't go in circles indefinately with you, anymore than
<br>
I would with him. At some point other considerations in this
<br>
contingent universe require I make a judgement. So sooner
<br>
or later I'd make a judgement on the best data available.
<br>
<p>At some point I might launch a pre-emptive strike because
<br>
if I did not the shit would hit the fan on some other front
<br>
I was being forced to neglect whilst I argued in circles. 
<br>
<p>I would not try and bs him about his self interest if he is
<br>
a genuine predator and likes it, that is a fact and that I
<br>
would deal with. This is why peace must be one. We 
<br>
can't choose it for others when they choose conflict.
<br>
We can only respond to their choice to predate on
<br>
us with resistance or surrender. I'm not into surrendering
<br>
my life any more than he/she is.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some are quite capable of going it alone while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others would die if seperated from the herd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; None are capable of going it alone yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But here is the point in the future we may re-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engineer ourselves to such an extent that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may indeed feel capable of going it alone. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; these indivduals will  not necessarily be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be reasoned with with the same starting premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [sociability etc]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These individuals may become meglomanical, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; persuing as the culmination of their individuality, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dominance over all else. Because, if you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empathy - why the hell not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; why not indeed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; And therein lies the danger of the future. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rugged immortal individualists fighting for supreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; godhood in the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; at least it would be entertaining :)
</em><br>
<p>It would be a continuation of the status quo except 
<br>
fewer sentients would die by misadventure or accident
<br>
and more would die by murder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; By why not? Seriously. I dunno but I figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god would be bored (and lonely) well perhaps not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  lonely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I don't particularly believe in God :)
</em><br>
<p>Neither do I. The lowercase letter was not a typo.
<br>
<p>There was a Jesuit Frence philosopher who tried
<br>
to reconcile the theory of evolution with theology.
<br>
He argued that God created the usiverse but through
<br>
the mechanism of evolution. Teilhard de Chardin.
<br>
(spelling may be wrong).
<br>
<p>I am not sure if it was his idea or my extended musings
<br>
on it, that posited &quot;the beginning there was only one
<br>
sentience&quot; it was bored and lonely so exploded itself
<br>
into fragments that made the universe and over time
<br>
those fragment coallesced into more and more intelligence.
<br>
There was a movement back towards godhood.
<br>
<p>However, power is seductive, and the satan myth is
<br>
provocative too. I can imagine self satisfied super
<br>
powered satanic like sentients wanting to be the one. 
<br>
<p>Let me be clear I am playing with *myths* here.
<br>
<p>Intellectually I am an agnostic. Practically I am
<br>
an atheist because the position of indecision about
<br>
whether the cavalry is coming or not I think we'd better
<br>
not dwell on whilst there other things so obviously needing
<br>
doing. Atheism is my operating hypothesis. All notions 
<br>
of god I have ever heard of were logically inconsistent 
<br>
or fanciful beyond my capacity to accept. I can't prove
<br>
there is no God if one adopts an atypical definition and
<br>
I am not going to waste too much time with the question. 
<br>
<p>If there is a god, my numbers in the phone book, he/she/it
<br>
can call me, meanwhile I'm busy trying to clean up the
<br>
mess with a few practical likeminded humanists like
<br>
myself.
<br>
<p>I have pretty much the same reaction to the notion that
<br>
we are in a sim and that their is some architect calling
<br>
the shots. I an agnostic on that point to and in practical
<br>
terms I act atheistic. I think this is *more* moral than the
<br>
alternative of waiting for the supernatural cavalry but that's
<br>
just my opinion. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Everyone is social to a degree. Am I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saying that &gt; &gt; everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is reachable through their residual sociability. I doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it. I think nature throws up dysfunctional types of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forms and some genuine sociopaths can probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only be dealt with as amoral threats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; watch some interviews with a sociopath :)  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they're really quite fascinating...  anyways, there's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason to render a sociopath a threat; in fact, I'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; say they can be harnassed to detect flaws in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; current modes.
</em><br>
<p>I would not *render* them a threat. I'd make a judgement
<br>
as to whether they were a threat, a curiosity, or something
<br>
else on the evidence. A sociopathic serial killer that enjoys
<br>
it would not be *rendered* a threat by me but I would 
<br>
hope they would be accurately *perceived* as one by me
<br>
to the extent that they were.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Perhaps I'm saying sociopath when I mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pyschopath.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; they're both used interchangeably :) the explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference is between antisocial and socio/psychopathic... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The best guy (in my opinion was Clark)... Brilliant on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  this topic :)
