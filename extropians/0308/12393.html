The truth about polygraphs
<br>
<p>A National Academy of Sciences study validates long-held doubts about 
<br>
the reliability of polygraphs. So why does the government still rely on 
<br>
them to screen applicants for jobs?

<br>
<p>WAS HE SWEATING?
<br>
<p>Of course he was sweating.
<br>
<p>But he didn't want to be sweating, and he didn't want his heart to race 
<br>
this way, because he knew what that did to his blood pressure, and he 
<br>
knew that he was in a situation here in the Boston office of the Drug 
<br>
Enforcement Administration.
<br>
<p>Everybody there knew him from the days when he'd been the 
<br>
law-enforcement equivalent of a phenom pitcher straight out of the 
<br>
minors. So they knew why he was standing there, and he knew why he was 
<br>
standing there, and they knew that he knew. He was standing there 
<br>
because there was a man behind a closed door with a machine that 
<br>
claimed to know the truth of him better than he did. And he wasn't sure 
<br>
what the machine knew about him that he didn't know. He knew this 
<br>
situation well. He'd been trained to put suspects in this kind of a box.
<br>
<p>Once, when he was 16 and at a party, he'd smoked a little weed. The 
<br>
joint came by -- maybe once, maybe twice -- and he'd taken a puff. 
<br>
Maybe two. It was a long time ago and hard to remember, but it was long 
<br>
before he'd become interested in law enforcement and long before he'd 
<br>
become so good at it. It was long before he'd graduated from 
<br>
Northeastern University summa cum laude with his degree in criminal 
<br>
justice and long before the co-op job with the DEA. He'd planned on 
<br>
entering the DEA upon graduation but was tripped up by the budget 
<br>
shutdown of the mid-'90s.
<br>
<p>It was long before he'd gone to work for that antidrug task force down 
<br>
on Cape Cod, long before he'd grown his hair long and his beard out to 
<br>
go undercover to chase the speed labs and the dope-running boats, and 
<br>
it was long before someone had waved the gun at him in the crack house 
<br>
in New Bedford. It was long before he'd gotten a pilot's license 
<br>
because he'd heard the DEA had an air wing, and he thought he might 
<br>
like to be part of that, too. It was long before the awards and the 
<br>
citations, and it was long before he'd applied for the full-time job at 
<br>
DEA when the government reopened for business.
