<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, I hope that you and I are *both* grateful that the atoms

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sigh.  You are presupposing the goodness of what you prefer and then arguing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from that supposition that my not having that preference is wrong or perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even immoral.  This is a pretty boring game.
</em><br>
<p>I am arguing nothing.  I am painting a picture that either
<br>
will appeal to you more than does a volume containing dead
<br>
and inert matter, or it will not.  Apparently it does not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not consider converting a Jupiter size mass into the equivalent mass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of current humanity to be a net gain.    That large a mass of that limited a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of squabbling sentients would create such a tangle that nothing could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could come of it.  It would probably implode through the super concentration 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cussedness.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>One can only hope that you are indeed joking, because if the solar
<br>
system is indeed better off without a Jupiter sized mass of cussedness,
<br>
then it might well be better off more locally without an Earth sized
<br>
mass similarly distasteful.
<br>
<p>I highly recommend reading Roman history.  Consider the finest century
<br>
of the Republic that you can find, and if that doesn't make you proud of
<br>
what humanity has accomplished since, nothing will.
