<p>No change.

<p><em>&gt; 20 years ago?
</em><br>
<p>I feel much safer now.  Back then, I was living with the quasi-certainty
<br>
that WWIII would eventually happen, and even if it had turned out
<br>
to be only a limited nuclear conflict--the USA really wouldn't have
<br>
risked their annihilation over a piece of European real estate,
<br>
would they?--I would have lived right on the primary battlefield.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What are the major threats to your continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence/lifestyle? How about 10 years into the future? 
</em><br>
<p>Currently, traffic accidents.  Twenty years down the road cardiovascular
<br>
disease and cancer will start catching up fast, unless we see some
<br>
major medical advances in the meantime.  In the long term, the
<br>
statist and anti-technology forces in the western world are a direct
<br>
threat to my personal survival.
<br>
<p>On a very personal, identity-threatening level, I'm also increasingly
<br>
worried about mental hardening and mental faculties rapidly diminishing
<br>
with age.  Relatedly, I'm increasingly suffering the impression
<br>
that social progress is directly related to the old dying away.
<br>
<p>Terrorism is a very distant background threat, in line with rare
<br>
kinds of accidents and diseases.  If you want something to worry
<br>
about, go and read medical journals.  This will awaken the latent
<br>
hypochondriac in most people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just for a bit of extropian perspective, remember that it is still the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we all have a death sentence hanging over our heads, and will be until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone fixes it.
</em><br>
<p>And a good many people have no qualms openly stating that this is
<br>
a good thing and that you should die.  And this is unlikely to
<br>
change until they are dead.
