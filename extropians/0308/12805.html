<p><em>&gt; The comments below [BP: which I've snipped] prompt

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in advance.
</em><br>
<p>You questions, seeming genuine, don't irritate me. I'm glad
<br>
you ask them. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is becoming increasingly unclear to me that what it is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be an extropian is the same for every extropian. In fact, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we may hold disjoint sets of values, and disjoint 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions, in many cases. ie: We may be using the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word, but in fact have no common ground. I am brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this by a long history of reading the list, and in particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the comment below from Rafal, and by Robert's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion that maximising complexity is his guiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle in being an extropian.
</em><br>
<p>I think too much has been made of that one comment
<br>
by Rafal, as too much was made of one comment by
<br>
Robert.
<br>
<p>Consider Einstein and Bohr. When they got together to
<br>
talk they were both physicists. What they talked about, what
<br>
fired their passions and sparked their conversations was not
<br>
the overwhelming majority of things that they agreed on
<br>
(which most people of their time may have only considered
<br>
a small subset of), what they discussed were the points on
<br>
which they disagreed, and sometimes our champions who
<br>
we see bestriding the world like intellectual colossus (colossi?)
<br>
need a place to play, to make some mistakes and learn and
<br>
to be ordinary humans too.
<br>
<p>When Eliezer chastises Robert, or Damien teases Rafal
<br>
I don't see the good fighting with evil but thinkers who
<br>
sometimes get things wrong, and would admit it, wrestling
<br>
with the issues of the times. Bohr and Einstein when they
<br>
disagreed were only disagreeing about the nature of the
<br>
universe (no small thing from one standpoint) but neither
<br>
would claim the other was not a *physicist*.
<br>
<p>If we aren't finding things to disagree about then we
<br>
are not engaging with the challenges of the times and we
<br>
become a mutual congratulation society. But none of us
<br>
are entirely intellectual and I doubt any of us come 
<br>
entirely to the ExI list with totally thought out positions.
<br>
We come at times, I think, because of the salon thing
<br>
Anders and others mentions. 
<br>
<p>Hey sometimes our friends may fart in the lift and 
<br>
embarass us a bit (heck the other folks in the lift
<br>
might associate the emission with us) but we don't need
<br>
to respond by punching them out :-)
<br>
<p>Robert is not blowing up millions, Rafal is not executing
<br>
drones, both these guys are looking for solutions and
<br>
if we want to find they have feet of clay then its not
<br>
they that have claimed to be gods. I am glad to live in
<br>
a time where there is the technology to converse and
<br>
to communicate across oceans with the likes of Robert
<br>
and Eliezer and Rafal and Damien. And the list goes
<br>
on and on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So my questions is this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 - What do you consider to be extropian, or what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  do you believe it is to be an extropian?
</em><br>
<p>I like the extropian principles they are not perfect but
<br>
they are very good. I like the concept of extropy as
<br>
against entropy. I see no need to carry a card or to
<br>
tie myself to an oar. Let others label me. If I want to
<br>
save the ship I will row hard anyway voluntarily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2 - Do you consider yourself to be an extropian?
</em><br>
<p>Sort of, but I'm no card carrier. Its the ideas, and
<br>
the people I like. Its the travellers headed in the same
<br>
direction and making for a more pleasant trip.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3 - If not, why not? Do you hold values which you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe are in conflict with Extropy? Or is it purely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for &quot;I'm a tough non-joiner kinda dude(tte)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons? Or perhaps for PR reasons?
</em><br>
<p>The PR reasons factor for me (I am aware that if I get
<br>
into a lift with someone who enjoys farting loudly) 
<br>
people will judge me by the company I keep. 
<br>
<p>Sometimes this bothers me more than other times.
<br>
<p>I think when I was in primary school my highest aspiration
<br>
was to master the art of the ventriloquist fart and project
<br>
it in the direction of the most prim and proper teachers
<br>
pets. I've outgrown that now for the most part. But I still
<br>
like to play.
<br>
<p>I am politically aware enough to want to be interpreted
<br>
in context and to know that many perhaps even most people
<br>
will misunderstand anyway but there is no need to encourage 
<br>
that. I don't sleep in a tuxedo. One can be serious without
<br>
being serious all the time. One can be intelligent without 
<br>
having to be right or to deliver only verified proofs all the 
<br>
time. Sometimes its fun to collaborate on works that are
<br>
in progress. And many extropian threads are about thoughts
<br>
from folks who ideas are works in progress. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
