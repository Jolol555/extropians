<p><em>&gt; Well, the Fortune 500 send their buddies, lobbyists to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Journal...
</em><br>
<p>Well, who knows for sure what the reality is? I have
<br>
an open mind, but work for a *very* small company
<br>
under a pure and very smart little entrepreneur.  My
<br>
view may be unconsciously biased.
<br>
<p>Earlier Mitch wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, this is the new hatred of a pampered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class-driven bunch of people who, appear to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NO entrepreneurial acumen.
</em><br>
<p>What makes you feel it likely that you are speaking
<br>
for the typical American boss? That is not a rhetorical
<br>
question, I just want to know (you could be right).  My
<br>
own take is/was that we should expect ordinary free-market
<br>
competition to be working unless we have evidence to the
<br>
contrary. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They achieved their places in corporations, by knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right people.
</em><br>
<p>Well, so did J. P. Morgan (got started in business by
<br>
his father) while an even more silver-spooned contemporary
<br>
lost the family fortune because he did not have business
<br>
talents.  The key is whether the American entrepreneur
<br>
and business leader still has what it takes.  If not,
<br>
how do you explain the failure of competition and Darwin?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its not as if businessmen and women who have started
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful companies, themselves have achieved their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place on the boards of directors, and are now guiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies. Rather, they are suck-ups, who, with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of responsibility to their stockholders, let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone, society at large, are guiding their corporations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right onto the iceberg.
</em><br>
<p>SO HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS??  HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?
<br>
<p>;-)  Sorry, but if Rafal can get emotional then anyone can LOL.
