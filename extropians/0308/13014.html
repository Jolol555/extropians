Samantha writes concerning Robert's link.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My opinion about the cause is fundamentally that the mind abhors a vaccuum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;American culture has become pretty devoid of much real sense of purpose or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;values beyond consumerism and &quot;making it&quot;.    The lack of substance is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;palpable to many.    Anything that seems to fill the void is an attractor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Religions are good at filling or seeming to fill this void.  Add to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;increasingly rapid change and economic uncertainty and new post 9/11 levels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of fear and you have a very potent brew.
</em><br>
<p><p>I tend to agree, but there does seem to be a marked difference between the
<br>
U.S. and other parts of the world. Anti-intellectual evangelical
<br>
Protestantism is becoming the dominant form of Christianity in Europe, as
<br>
well as in the U.S. and much of Latin America, but believers are an
<br>
increasingly small part of a generally secular culture (as the article
<br>
pointed out). It's the U.S. in particular that seems to have such a large
<br>
religious population. I'm not sure why this is myself. I suspect we are
<br>
seeing the appearance of large, self-contained subcultures that increasingly
<br>
reject and cut themselves off from what they see as the 'sinful'way of life
<br>
around them.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Another factor I am very sorry to have to acknowledge is that America has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been dumbed down on purpose.  With a non-black illteracy rate of 14% and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;black illteracy rate as high as 40% the problem begins to show itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Polls of the lack of knowledge about the world among Americans, even very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply knowledge your average 6th grader would know, are commonplace.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another poll reports that over 50% of college graduates report that they
</em><br>
did
<br>
<em>&gt;not read another book after they graduated no matter how many years ago
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;was.
</em><br>
<p>It's the same over here. The ignorance of the students I teach is often
<br>
simply staggering. Last year I asked a student who had delivered a short
<br>
talk on the Dreyfus Affair what he thought the connection to zionism was.
<br>
Response: &quot;What's Zionism?&quot;. Less than half the class knew.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Massive sense of meaningless, lack of training in reasoning and logic,
</em><br>
large
<br>
<em>&gt;doses of subjectivism and cultural relativism among the educated,
</em><br>
uncertanty
<br>
<em>&gt;about the future - it all adds up to high vulnerability for comforting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comprehensive memes.   And yes, it also tends toward distrust of and anger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward the intellect as much of the imbibed intellectual fashion of the day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taught fundamental meaninglessness and subjectivity and arbitrariness of
</em><br>
all
<br>
<em>&gt;values and value systems.   The distrust of the intellect is because of
</em><br>
what
<br>
<em>&gt;the intellectuals tell them and because using the intellect would seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threaten the new found comfort memes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- samantha
</em><br>
Dangerous, I agree. I think the tide is turning somewhat among the
<br>
intellectuals however, there is a growing reaction against the irrationalism
<br>
that found expression in such movements as pomo, I feel. Steve Davies
