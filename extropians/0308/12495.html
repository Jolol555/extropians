<p>Clearly we need more than energy to function. We need nutrients to
<br>
build new protein and lipids for various functions, replacements for
<br>
lost molecules and of course lots of water. We lose plenty of
<br>
molecules and atoms because of the way we are evolved; it is easier
<br>
to get replacements than recycle.
<br>
<p>A device that took ADP and phosphoric acid to ATP would need to be
<br>
intracellular, since ATP is so quickly burned. A device that
<br>
converted carbon dioxide and water to glucose would be more easily
<br>
integrated, although it would have some cooling issues
<br>
(energetically uphill, thermodynamic losses, likely at least a few
<br>
tens of watts for normal metabolism). It would need to keep track of 
<br>
insulin levels in order not to cause type II diabetes.
<br>
<p>Using such a device in everyday life would be troublesome, since we 
<br>
can too easily get enough glucose anyway. The device might detect it 
<br>
and turn off (and even go into glucose burning mode), but it would 
<br>
not be much of an help. In an emergency it could provide energy, but 
<br>
there remains a need for protein, fats and some other essentials, 
<br>
and when you eat them you can just as easy get the calories.
<br>
<p>So in the end the device might be less useful than it seems. If it 
<br>
nanofactures other nutrients, e.g. from recycled waste, then it 
<br>
would be more useful.
