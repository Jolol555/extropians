</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Me again, to clarify]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...the US signed on to resolution 1441, then went on
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; violation--you used the term &quot;breach&quot;--of the charter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could such a breach be cause to impeach, nullify,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; censure, limit, revoke, place on probation, etc, the
</em><br>

<em>&gt; thereby deprive the US of its UNSC veto power?
</em><br>
<p>No. Not there is simply *no* mechanism within the 
<br>
charter for censoring or expelling a permanent security
<br>
council member.
<br>
<p>All resolutions moved to such an effect would not pass
<br>
that permanent members veto. There is *nothing* more
<br>
powerful in the UN Charter than a permanent security
<br>
council members veto as such can prevent any security 
<br>
council resolution. To find more power one has to
<br>
step outside the UN process and one can only do that
<br>
(in my opinion) by revoking the charter itself (and that
<br>
could only be a wholesale not piecemeal revokation). 
<br>
<p>[The Charter can be found btw at
<br>
<a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html">http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html</a> ]
<br>
<p>There is provision in the charter for expelling member
<br>
nations under Article 6 which states:
<br>
<p>&quot;A Member of the United Nations which has persistently
<br>
violated the Principles contained in the present Charter
<br>
may be expelled from the Organisation by the General
<br>
Assembly upon recommendation of the Security Council&quot;.
<br>
<p>So the Security Council would first need to &quot;resolve&quot; to
<br>
expell a member before it could recommend the action
<br>
to the General Assembly. The veto of a permanent security
<br>
council member would prevent any such resolution being
<br>
made. 
<br>
<p>There is no explicit provision within the Charter for 
<br>
winding it (the Charter) up. I would argue though that on
<br>
grounds of logic any agreement made between parties for
<br>
a purpose can be dissolved upon manifest evidence of 
<br>
prior bad faith in honouring the agreement by other parties.
<br>
<p>In practice the US has the might to revoke the charter and
<br>
their would be no higher court of appeal, but it does not
<br>
need to. It has embarked into new territory where it just
<br>
disregards its obligations under the charter if it so chooses
<br>
and their is not higher mightier power to oppose it (not 
<br>
within the UN Charter). If the US (or any one country that
<br>
happened to be a security council permanent member)
<br>
went to far other nations might band together to form a new
<br>
force but they'd need to do it outside the UN umbrella.
<br>
Needless to say they'd be very careful about doing so.
<br>
<p>At the risk of belabouring a point the US is a great country
<br>
with a fine history of jurisprudence and fairness but it has
<br>
made an error. The citizens of the US in my view (and not 
<br>
only them the citizens of the UK and Australia as well) 
<br>
were asleep on matters of international law when our 
<br>
governments were purporting to act on it. 
<br>
<p>The reason for labouring this is that we should not fall asleep
<br>
again. International law matters. It is damn hard to do much
<br>
internationally without it. It must rate very highly in any
<br>
triaging exercise that we (educated humans) do. And it is not
<br>
necessary for countries to say they don't trust America or the
<br>
UK on matters of international law for them not to trust them.
<br>
<p>My message is that Americas should be vigilant and look to
<br>
their own precious constitution, 
<br>
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html</a>
<br>
that they should take seriously their right and opportunity to 
<br>
vote and to speak their views because if they do not they may
<br>
find they do not retain them. More precious than your wage is
<br>
your vote and your right to try to persuade others of your views.  
<br>
<p>The gulf war was a phenomenal display of the power of 
<br>
governments to control and direct the media to shift and shape
<br>
public opinion. In my view no single politician played that game
<br>
better than Australia's own PM, John Winston Howard though
<br>
he played it from a less important and less powerful position.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
