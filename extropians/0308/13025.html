<em>&gt; It would be interesting to speculate how much the &quot;run-up&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity might be driving people into a &quot;haven&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancient ideas because they fear the unknown of the future.
</em><br>
<p>I attend a college affiliated with the ELCA, and I've also noticed this
<br>
&quot;death&quot; of the Christian intellectual tradition.  It's amazing how many of
<br>
the professed christians among my fellow students (the majority being ELCA
<br>
Lutherans) have no grasp of the most prominent theologians of their faith,
<br>
such as Paul Tillich and Karl Barth.  I recently took a bioethics class in
<br>
which I presented a case defending stem cell therapies, genetic
<br>
manipulation, cryonics, uploads, and essentially the whole transhumanist
<br>
package using Lutheran theology, yet the class was more taken by the purely
<br>
emotional and Kassian arguments presented by one of the nursing majors
<br>
against reproductive cloning.  An example of a dialogue that commenced:
<br>
<p>Me: So, what are your views based upon?  In final analysis, what is wrong
<br>
with this procedure?
<br>
<p>Student: I just feel that it's wrong.
<br>
<p>Me: What is that feeling based upon?
<br>
<p>Student: It's based upon god.
<br>
<p>Me: So you have a direct channel to god?  You know exactly what god thinks?
<br>
I don't believe that such &quot;religious&quot; defenses are valid in an argument.
<br>
<p>Student: {no comment}
<br>
<p>All too often, it seems that &quot;god&quot; becomes little more than an apotheosis of
<br>
an individual's prejudices.
<br>
<p>Sad, really, but I can understand their feelings.  While I largely agree
<br>
with Tillich's theology, in the end I found it largely irrelevant- one is
<br>
left with a religion that there is essentially no reason to practice, and
<br>
for that reason I abandoned my Lutheran upbringing and moved on to Zen,
<br>
which presented both a religious view that I found intellectually satisfying
<br>
and a meaningful practice.  But it seems that &quot;intellectual satisfaction&quot;
<br>
isn't an essential component of religious belief these days.
