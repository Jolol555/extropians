<p><em>&gt; I'm all for transparency in theory, but just how transparent

</em><br>
<em>&gt; would willingly display every facet of their life to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the world ?
</em><br>
<p>I would happily, *happily* do so if everyone else would,
<br>
or, in other words, I would contribute towards the development
<br>
of technology that would enable any of us to spy all the time
<br>
on any of us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you really like your Mother, Boss or neighbours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be able to watch while you improve your prostate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health (as described in a recent post) ?
</em><br>
<p>I have overcome, at great cost and difficulty, the
<br>
notion that I am or would be especially interesting
<br>
for people to observe.
<br>
<p>I even go so far as to imagine that neither my mother
<br>
nor my boss would lack for better things to do than
<br>
monitor or spy on me.  I have already reached the
<br>
point that all I would feel is pity for those who
<br>
would waste their time penetrating my paltry secrets
<br>
and following the boring details of my life.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In an 'ideal' transparent world where access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about anyone and anything, anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is available. Where do we set the level for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal privacy? if at all.
</em><br>
<p>Alex, let's just let it all hang out.  (Or do I give
<br>
my generational allegiance away?)
<br>
<p>Natasha writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I like this list being transparent, and I'm more inclined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to promote a transparent culture. Conversely, I am a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private person and don't like people knowing my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business unless I share it.
</em><br>
<p>But perhaps if there were 6x10^9 other people you would have
<br>
to compete with for attention, then you'd feel (properly)
<br>
neglected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is the gossip and assumption factors.  If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't tell everything, people make assumptions.  If I lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a society that was more compassionate and reasonable, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't mind it being much more transparent - and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes for my personal life.
</em><br>
<p>This touches on the key point to me.  It's never the *knowledge*
<br>
of what I or anyone else is up to that is crucial, it's the
<br>
*power* to do something about it.  I think that if we survey
<br>
the literature that addresses totalitarian oppression, from
<br>
the Spanish Inquisition to Nineteen-Eighty-Four, then we find
<br>
that it's not at all the surveillance that is the problem, but
<br>
rather the ability of the authorities to *do* something about
<br>
it.  Solzhenitsyn uses an entire chapter to describe &quot;The Arrest&quot;.
<br>
<p>If we are safe in our persons and property, then let's not
<br>
care what is known about us.
<br>
<p>Lee
