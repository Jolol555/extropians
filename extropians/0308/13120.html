<em>&gt; &gt; We agree that: Communists are awful. Terrorists are awful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Saddam was awful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, let me be the first to welcome you to our minority viewpoint.
</em><br>
<p>It's hardly a minority on this list- in fact, I'd be willing to wager that
<br>
everyone on this list agrees with those sentiments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Glad you can admit it.  But don't say 'we agree' unless you mean merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and I, because other members of this list obviously do not agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that statement.
</em><br>
<p>Name one, by name, please.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because members of this list have argued in favor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of anarcho socialism,
</em><br>
<p>Making an argument and playing devil's advocate are perfectly legitimate.
<br>
I've been arguing in favor of fascism in many of my Poli Sci classes, just
<br>
to provoke fights with other students.  My professors know that I'm just a
<br>
minarchist liberal, though, who is playing a game with my fellow students to
<br>
try to make them realize the contradictions of their own positions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that the 'good guys' won in indochina,
</em><br>
<p>We can debate forever about whether or not the wars fought in Indochina were
<br>
ours to fight, whether they were winnable, etc, ect- it's a dead horse
<br>
folks- STOP BEATING IT!  I thought the Extropy list was about the future,
<br>
not the past...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that Kuwait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't a legit country because Saddam didn't recognize it, etc. etc.
</em><br>
<p>That's just ridiculous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will continue to repeat that communists, terrorists, and saddam are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awful and present evidence supporting that statement until I no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see such odd statements on this mailing list, or until I come across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convincing evidence suggesting the none of those things are awful.
</em><br>
<p>Alright.  I'm going to start constantly posting messages stating that the
<br>
sky is blue and the grass is green.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know my anti-communists and terrorists articles are quite distracting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your 'land of lets only talk about whats wrong with the US' possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision of this mailing list, but I'm sure recent developments in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list will help to bring about such a vision.
</em><br>
<p>Alright.  Damien posted a message reporting on how many people are
<br>
incarcerated in the US.  This is a major concern for many people here and
<br>
abroad.  Why does America have a higher crime rate than the rest of the
<br>
industrialized world?  What can we do about it?  How much of this &quot;crime&quot; is
<br>
victimless in nature (such as drug posession)?  How many people are falsely
<br>
imprisoned?  How many of the rich and powerful manage to get away with
<br>
crimes and plea bargains while the same offense would land your typical
<br>
young black man or native American in prison for years?
<br>
<p>I'm from South Dakota, which has the highest rate of incarceration in the
<br>
country, thanks to the judicial policies put in place and the prison system
<br>
built by our former Attorney General and four-term Governor Bill Janklow,
<br>
now serving in congress.  Last week, our esteemed congressman, who has a
<br>
long history of speeding tickets and accidents, sped through a stop sign in
<br>
his '95 DeVille- and killed a motorcyclist.  He's had 10 speeding tickets
<br>
and been in several accidents in the last ten years- he should have had his
<br>
liscense revoked.  The area of the accident was blocked off for a mile in
<br>
every direction, and Janklow, although reported unconscious after the
<br>
accident, was not admitted to a hospital, but taken back to his home by his
<br>
wife and put under protection by the authorities.  In all likelyhood, rather
<br>
than going to prison for this occurence, he'll plea bargain his way into a
<br>
relatively small fine.
<br>
<p>Another instance- drug posession.  I have, in the past, used marijuana.
<br>
Many of my friends have used it and posessed it as well- and many of them
<br>
have ended up in jail or prison because of it.  The funny thing is, all of
<br>
those who have gone to jail or prison were from lower-class and
<br>
working-class backgrounds, while the children of attorneys, doctors,
<br>
businessmen, and politicians never seem to be bothered by authorities, no
<br>
matter how much they posess or use...
<br>
<p>There's definitely some hypocrisy in this system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Indeed, it is.  At least in the US, though, the things that will get you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tossed in jail are pretty well established, documented, and supported by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority.  All one need to is not steal, assault, kill, or deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drugs.
</em><br>
<p>Or be falsely accused and unable to afford a decent attorney.  Or posess
<br>
some harmless drugs.  Or, in my home city, not be caught congregating
<br>
publicly in groups of eight or more after 10:00 at night, caught passing a
<br>
checkpoint more than twice after 10:00, or caught on a police camera going
<br>
through a red light (just like a certain congressman)...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And as far as influence, as an American my vote obviously was able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly influence the continuation of a murderous tyrannical regime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this begs the question, is there anything we truly do not have *any*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence on?
</em><br>
<p>Editorial Comment: Replacing a murderous dictator with a violent anarchy
<br>
isn't necessarily progress.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I wasn't asking for the whole article to be reproduced violating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyright, I would have liked to seen a link to the article to read more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the study.  I would genuinely be interested to know how they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined the incarceration rate in other not so open societies, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communist ones, or tyranical dictator ones, or oppresive theocracies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E.g. Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea, China, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>China's incarcerated population is somewhere between 25 Million and 30
<br>
Million- higher than the entire population of Iraq, imprisoned without due
<br>
process, often for dubious reasons.  Yet, while we invaded Iraq, we instead
<br>
support trade deregulation with China and hand them our industrial sector on
<br>
a silver platter.  More hypocrisy?
