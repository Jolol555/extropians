honest-to-dog challenge -- next time you can take six months off from
<br>
work, go out and try living at the lower end of the economic scale...
<br>
<p><p><p>Barbara, I have *some* experience with poverty in the
<br>
form of a summer in Seattle in a $50 a month &quot;apartment&quot;.
<br>
It had no electricity or windows, but the four apartments
<br>
had running water in the common kitchen down the hall, and 
<br>
even a homebrew &quot;shower&quot; of sorts, plus an actual flush
<br>
toilet, so it wasn't as primitive as Gilligan's Island.
<br>
I've been rich and I've been poor.  Rich is better.  {8^D
<br>
<p><p>... Here are the rules:
<br>
<p>1. You cannot rely on your higher education or professional
<br>
experience...
<br>
<p>I didn't have those at the time, just an incomplete
<br>
engineering degree and not the foggiest clue.
<br>
<p>... 2. You have to leave your vehicle(s), credit cards, nice clothing,
<br>
etc. at home...
<br>
<p>That was easy: didn't have a vehicle at the time,
<br>
unless you count a junkyard-refugee motorcycle I
<br>
managed to resurrect.  Didn't have credit cards
<br>
or nice clothing either.
<br>
<p><p>... 3. You cannot take money from your bank account via ATM, online or
<br>
through any other means...
<br>
<p><p>There were no ATMs in 83, but it didn't matter, since I
<br>
had no bank account anyway, nor any actual money to put 
<br>
in it had I had one.
<br>
<p><p>...The only way you're allowed to get money is to earn it or obtain it
<br>
through begging...
<br>
<p><p>The minimum wage was so high with respect to prices
<br>
in the early 80s that teenagers had to compete for
<br>
those jobs with actual adults.  I lost.  {8^D
<br>
<p><p>... (by the way, I've been told by people who know from first-hand
<br>
experience that for the short term, you can do better by begging than by
<br>
getting a minimum wage job...
<br>
<p><p>Funny you should mention that, for I just returned from
<br>
a motorcycle trip down to one of my favorite hangouts,
<br>
Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  I had to check
<br>
out the controversial new Hooters, make sure that the
<br>
young nubiles employed there were not being exploited 
<br>
by the evil capitalists, you understand.    (Oh my goodness,
<br>
if only I were an evil capitalist.  There were a number
<br>
of shapely young lovelies at that Hooters who I would 
<br>
cheerfully and repeatedly exploit.  {8^D  )
<br>
<p>On the wharf, one can see a large number of unoccupied
<br>
ecological niches for those in the gray area between
<br>
working and begging, an occupation that may be generically
<br>
defined as &quot;Will work for fooding.&quot;  Along with the usual
<br>
collection of harlots of both genders (and everything
<br>
in between), one will see various street entertainers, 
<br>
mimes, joke tellers, buskers, instrumentalists, card
<br>
tricksters, fire-and-brimstone preachers, etc, all making 
<br>
an apparently decent tax free living off of tips from the 
<br>
touristas.  
<br>
<p>The will-work-for-fooders can make it by having a
<br>
schtick: pretending to have Parkinsons disease, for
<br>
instance.  Today I saw one dressed in fishing garb,
<br>
hip boots, lure encrusted vest, with a sign saying
<br>
&quot;The worst day fishing beats the best day working.&quot;
<br>
He had a pole with a paper cup tied on the end of
<br>
his line.  Whenever a tourista would drop a few
<br>
coins in his cup, he would shout &quot;GOT ONE!&quot; and
<br>
reel it in.  
<br>
<p>Of course everyone there was a Vietnam veteran, 
<br>
including those who were born well after the fall 
<br>
of Saigon and those older than Senator Strom Thurman.  
<br>
A notable exception was one whose sign insisted 
<br>
&quot;NOT a Vietnam vet.  Went to Canada.  It sucked there too.&quot;  
<br>
The touristas gave him money.
<br>
<p>The saxophone player got my attention, for I am
<br>
sure I can play better than he.  With my
<br>
scrawny build, I could set up a sign saying
<br>
&quot;Starving Musician&quot; and people would believe it.
<br>
I have never used any kind of dope, but I kinda
<br>
look like a heroine addict, so perhaps people
<br>
would withhold donations for fear that they
<br>
would be contributing to my downfall.  {8^D
<br>
<p><p>...4. You have to live like this for a minimum of six months...
<br>
<p><p>Interesting challenge Barbara, but I must decline,
<br>
for in my business, aerospace engineering, a six
<br>
month hole in the resume will result in one's losing
<br>
one's clearances, for the security people cannot
<br>
be sure one was not conspiring with the commies
<br>
during that period.  That small portion of aerospace
<br>
engineering that does not require clearances has
<br>
already been mostly outsourced to Russia, with
<br>
little chance of it ever returning.  A lot of
<br>
those who left the biz to chase a dream during
<br>
the dot.com boom were unable to get back in.  Im
<br>
not ready to retire, altho the possibility of
<br>
job loss in the next couple years looms large.
<br>
<p><p>...Also, bare survival isn't enough if you have children...
<br>
<p>This I freely acknowledge.  By the time the kids
<br>
get to first grade, they quickly learn that
<br>
poor is not sexy, and counterculture is not sexy.
<br>
I suspect that some of our best ruthless capitalists
<br>
grew up in antimaterialist homes.  But the media
<br>
soon bombards them with messages that wealth, glamour
<br>
and glitter is where it is at, brought to you by
<br>
glamour and glitter salesmen.  This is not a value
<br>
judgement on my part, merely an observation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Today you can earn enough to support yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a similar manner by working only a few months.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look around you, Robbie.  Farmland is as cheap as,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, dirt.  It costs practically nothing.
</em><br>
<p>...&quot;Practically nothing&quot; is quite relative. You can pick up land in the
<br>
middle of the desert for just a few bucks an acre, but most tracts of
<br>
land on the market are in the thousands of acres...
<br>
<p><p>My comment came from our family's experience with
<br>
my great-grandfather's farm in Greenup county Kentucky.
<br>
The family moved there in 1915 and they farmed it until
<br>
about the mid sixties, not very profitably I might add.
<br>
Then my grandfather and two of his brothers hobby farmed 
<br>
it after he retired on and off in the 70s.  The vacant
<br>
farm is still owned by one of my uncles but has been 
<br>
fallow for three decades.
<br>
<p>Greenup county has fewer people now than at the dawn
<br>
of the 20th century, as most of the small farms up
<br>
thru there have been abandoned.  The soil is good there,
<br>
a stream runs year around, but it is hilly, so the 16
<br>
(or so) farmable acres are irregularly shaped and not
<br>
well suited to large farm equipment.  Somehow they managed
<br>
to raise six children on that land.  That farm and
<br>
others like it can be had for a very low price.  Many
<br>
of them are likely being held merely for sentimental
<br>
reasons, and arrangements could be had to rent those
<br>
farms for almost nothing.  
<br>
<p>But none of the farms up that way have been operated 
<br>
for any real profit for a long time.  Tobacco is the 
<br>
only profitable product, but tobacco is a very labor 
<br>
intensive crop, so it would require a large family 
<br>
to make it go, and even then, most of the children 
<br>
would likely eventually conclude than a minimum wage 
<br>
job in twon is a far easier way to live.
<br>
<p>Another example of a way to make a living without
<br>
begging or a 9 to 5 is found up along the Kern
<br>
River in Southern Taxifornia.  On the map, find
<br>
Ridgecrest, go west on 178 to Lake Isabella, turn
<br>
north up to Johnsondale and Camp Nelson.  There
<br>
are a few subsistence farms along the river, and no
<br>
one cares what the hell you do up that way.
<br>
<p>Gleaning of fields: I have an old college buddy who 
<br>
raises potatoes in Idaho.  Every year people show up
<br>
with burlap sacks right after the harvesters
<br>
are finished, every year he gives them as many
<br>
potatoes as they can physically carry away.  He's
<br>
a generous guy: last year a vw bus showed up.  He
<br>
loaded them up with as many as it would hold, these
<br>
being potatoes he already paid to have harvested.
<br>
I figure it is only a matter of time before someone
<br>
arranges to step on some sharp object or somehow
<br>
&quot;accidentally&quot; injure themselves while gleaning those 
<br>
fields, so they can get themselves a free ticket in 
<br>
the lawsuit lottery.
<br>
<p>Those who say it is getting tougher seem to want to
<br>
both live near a city and raise larvae, two tasks that
<br>
I would agree would be tough if one wants to drop
<br>
out of the rat race.  My contention is that if you
<br>
forgo all luxuries, don't smoke, drink or do drugs, 
<br>
then it is easier now to merely survive than ever before.
<br>
<p>Still, I cheerfully opt for the modern rat race and 
<br>
everything that goes with it: the pressing crowds, 
<br>
the vanity and vexation, the endless search for meaning, 
<br>
the hurry, the struggle of constant competition, 
<br>
the pointless glory of it all.  
<br>
<p>May the fastest rat win.
