</em><br>
<p>I think I saw people on this list affected by terrorism. I think 
<br>
I saw rational intelligent people retreat in the face of hard 
<br>
choices to polemic positions that I would have thought and 
<br>
hoped that they would not do. 
<br>
<p>I saw it become nearly impossible to have a discourse on
<br>
foreign policy, international law or the lack of it and the 
<br>
state of its emergence as poeple for the most part 
<br>
*seemed* to retreat to emotional prejudices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More subjective: would you rate yourself now (hopefully
</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; lifestyle? How about 10 years into the future? 
</em><br>
<p>This is a good stock taking question. 
<br>
<p>Ten and twenty years ago I was 26 and 16 respectively.
<br>
I then knew considerably less than I know now but had
<br>
more time than I have now to learn and to try and find ways
<br>
to as Voltaire said cultivate our garden, using humanism or
<br>
variants of it as an applied philosophy.
<br>
<p>I think my level of personal optimism peaked around 
<br>
1999/2000 when Dolly was cloned, the human genome
<br>
was racing along, Thomson and Gearheart had isolated 
<br>
human embryonic stem cells. I was aware that books
<br>
like Damien Brodericks Last Mortal generation were
<br>
seeping into the social and cultural groundwater and 
<br>
I was discovering to my delight the power of the internet
<br>
and the range of kindred spirits or thinkers of likemind
<br>
exploring such issues as cryonics, uploading, biotechnology,
<br>
ethics etc. It seemed then that the world had grown up
<br>
and the time and opportunity for serious change had never
<br>
been better.
<br>
<p>Then Bush won the presidency and put embryonic stem
<br>
cell research (which we need for basic understanding of life)
<br>
in concrete and did his best to sink it. Bush then went on to
<br>
attack that weak emerging thing that was international law, 
<br>
not because in my view he is an evil man, but because in my
<br>
view he is an idiot elected by a complacent electorate that
<br>
took its eye off the ball and forgot that great damage could
<br>
be done to a great country by putting so much power in the
<br>
hands of such a nitwit.
<br>
<p>In short Bush was never capable of competently flying the 
<br>
plane that is the United States of America. I think he has
<br>
through incompetence rather than malice sold the US best
<br>
interests down the river. He has planted the seeds of
<br>
terrorism at the same time as he professed to be trying to
<br>
crack down on it.
<br>
<p>I have also learned how little we actually know. The human
<br>
genome project is important and empowering stuff. But we
<br>
are only just beginning to get that it is not genomics but
<br>
epigenomics that matters and epigenomics is to a substantial
<br>
degree hamstrung by policies that make it incredibly difficult
<br>
to conduct the sort of basic research that is needed to
<br>
understand human embryology.
<br>
<p>On the patents front, biotech has raced into a quagmire from
<br>
which it will no doubt emerge but not before considerable
<br>
time and effort is wasted getting policies straight that in my
<br>
naivety I would have hoped could have been straighten out 
<br>
much more quickly.
<br>
<p>I have learned somewhat saddly that things take far longer 
<br>
than I imagined that they would need to and that the reason 
<br>
that this is so is that we are far less wise in the areas that 
<br>
matter than we often give ourselves credit for. 
<br>
<p>I have also learnt that we know far less about the human 
<br>
nervous system that I thought that we did and that as a 
<br>
consequence progress on the cybernetics front, on AI 
<br>
and on uploading and the plausibility of cryonics is likely
<br>
to take longer than I would have hoped.
<br>
<p>Perhaps for me one of the biggest disappointments was
<br>
that politicians like Bush and Blair and Howard could 
<br>
bullshit so categorically to their own electorates and the
<br>
own electorates for the most part would swallow
<br>
without chewing. There was plenty of opportunity before
<br>
hand for smarter constituents to hold their elected leaders
<br>
to account and yet they failed to do so. I feel like I have
<br>
witnessed first hand vast numbers of intelligent people
<br>
buy a line of BS that is little more sophisticated that that
<br>
peddled in such Hollywood movies as &quot;Wag the dog&quot; 
<br>
and then even when as was the case with Australian Prime
<br>
Minister Howard people came to the view that they had 
<br>
been either intentionally mislead (around 37%) or un-
<br>
intentionally mislead (around a third -by Howard doing 
<br>
to little thinking and too much believing) these same
<br>
constituents thought so little of the crock that was 
<br>
perpetrated in a so called representative democracy that
<br>
they said they'd probably go ahead and vote for him
<br>
again anyway. 
<br>
<p>I am not a religious person, but on the matter of the
<br>
Iraq war, it is my feeling that the quality of debate and 
<br>
the lack of critical thinking that prevailed even in circles
<br>
where I though critical thinking was estemed, was of 
<br>
such a low standard that I began to wonder if this generation
<br>
was too stupid to deserve to be the last mortal generation.
<br>
<p>In 10 years. We will I hope have substantially increased 
<br>
our understanding of human developmental processses, 
<br>
of epigenetics, and we will be able (if we are very lucky 
<br>
or far more politically astute) to produce far better maps
<br>
of the human neural system which in turn will prompt better
<br>
research and development in cybernetics make cryonics
<br>
and uploading considertably lesser leaps of faith than 
<br>
they are now. In 10 years Bush will be gone but will the
<br>
damage he did the UN and the cause of international
<br>
law have been undone? I don't know. I doubt it.
<br>
<p>In 10 years the issues of intellectual property will have
<br>
largely been sorted out. The public policy aspects are
<br>
not that complicated. It should be able to reconfigure
<br>
systems such that in order to have flow through benefits
<br>
of technologies to end users it is not necessary to negotiate
<br>
&nbsp;with a myriad of stake holder all of whom can bog down
<br>
the process and set themselves up as toll gate holders on
<br>
the road to progress.
<br>
<p>In 10 years we will be seeing whether through ham fisted
<br>
idiotic approaches to foreign policy the Bush government
<br>
may have freed the US from having to play nice with such
<br>
regimes as the Saudis.
<br>
<p>And in 10 years an entire new batch of medicines will have
<br>
made their way through clinical trials and be available on 
<br>
the market.
<br>
<p>Important questions such as what is the nature and moral 
<br>
weighting of  a person will still be being discussed but they
<br>
will be being discussed by nearly everyone. That much, that
<br>
that conversation *will* take place stands as an achievement
<br>
of note. And the Kass's and the Fukayamas will find 
<br>
themselves arguing increasingly bizaree esoteric points with a
<br>
new generation of thinkers who will have come to maturity 
<br>
in a world where the inevitability of death or at least the
<br>
possibility of radically extended life will not have been radical
<br>
but will have been common place. And this new generalition
<br>
will, I suspect eat the specious deathist arguments of such
<br>
crusty old farts as Kass for breakfast. 
<br>
<p>Self interest and clear thinking will, baring some major 
<br>
policy fuck ups of Bushesque proportions (and he only 
<br>
gets one more go at the presidency at worst) bring this
<br>
new generation of thinkers hard onto the fallacies and 
<br>
specious arguments of Kass etc.
<br>
<p>Ironically, the last few years, especially the experience of 
<br>
watching societies reaction to their elected leaders statements
<br>
around the Iraq war has left me with a sense that is heavily
<br>
reminiscent of the bible story of the Israelites in the desert.
<br>
They were too jaded to get to see the promised land
<br>
themselves. But their children born in the desert and having 
<br>
never known the constraints of slavery were able to push
<br>
forward and conquer the promised land. I suspect it may
<br>
be so with us. I hope it is not so. I still hope that we may
<br>
lift our game.
<br>
<p>I hope this generation, my generation, can lift its game, 
<br>
because currently we are getting the cruddly leadership
<br>
(Bush, Blair, Howard) that we deserve.
<br>
<p>And I think we are in serious danger of 'believing' 
<br>
ourselves uncritically to death.

post is in the nature of the second ]
