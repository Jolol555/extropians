<em>&gt; &gt; Now, my proposal was not in any way based on race or culture.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent cultural differences that it would be best to destroy them.
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe Bryan that I made that assertion.  And if I implied
<br>
it I would retract it.  If I were arguing on a &quot;cultural&quot; basis
<br>
then it might make sense to eliminate North Korea, South Korea,
<br>
Japan, China, perhaps Russia, the Middle East... (I would not know
<br>
where to stop).
<br>
<p>The specific and precise problem with North Korea is that they
<br>
are not a member of the international community and do not appear
<br>
to want to be other than with respect to how they can black-mail
<br>
the members for their direct benefit.
<br>
<p>They *also* appear to have a political community (a significant
<br>
fraction of 22 million people) who have been brainwashed into
<br>
thinking that their system works.  [Doesn't matter that their people
<br>
are starving to death -- they are a potential nuclear power and
<br>
one with the ability to hurl nuclear weapons at &quot;western&quot; nations
<br>
(e.g. South Korea or Japan) the impact of which could have serious
<br>
economic consequences for the U.S. (even ignoring the impact on
<br>
nearby Asian countries).  The trickle down effects are more unemployment
<br>
in the U.S., less money to combat AIDS in Africa or India, etc.
<br>
<p>Please do the comparison -- 22 million lives at risk in North Korea
<br>
or hundreds of millions of lives at risk in Africa and other parts
<br>
of Asia.  Real lives -- people living *now* [so significantly less
<br>
present value analysis required].
<br>
<p>What I was trying to get at was that (a) these people have *very*
<br>
different belief systems (I think Anders saw that).  He also pointed
<br>
out how there may be deficits in the Extropian Principles that do
<br>
not make it clear *how* to deal with such problems (you are talking
<br>
about fundamental programming that may be either wrong or highly
<br>
biased); and (b) the fact that the costs may be high if we don't
<br>
deal with it (whether it be hundreds of millions of lives now or
<br>
or 100 trillion lives per second later).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your exact question was,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;How do extropians/transhumanists deal with very strong cultures with very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-western priorities?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this I believe is an accurate statement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your solution was *destroying the culture in question*.  That is genocide.
</em><br>
<p>Granted -- given some discussion as to whether a large number
<br>
of brain-washed individuals can be legitimately called a &quot;culture&quot;.
<br>
&quot;Cultures&quot; can evolve -- that does not appear to be the current
<br>
situation in North Korea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;How does genocide differ from triage?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Ok, good -- someone engages in the question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The argument I put forward in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous post, which you may not have seen, is simply that triage is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly situated, whereas your proposal (genocide) is not.
</em><br>
<p>Reasonable.  So the question becomes one of &quot;immediacy&quot; (and/or the
<br>
question reverts to the value of various current or future human
<br>
lives).
<br>
<p>I believe there is probably a complete set of military &quot;action points&quot;
<br>
with regard to North Korea.  The U.S. is currently inactive in
<br>
this area because most if not all of them would probably not
<br>
yield pretty results.  That has been the case for between one and
<br>
four decades.
<br>
<p>So the question I propose is &quot;*HOW* much have the U.S. and South
<br>
Korea spent over the last 10-40 years &quot;containing&quot; the problem
<br>
of North Korea?&quot;  And the followup question is &quot;*What* is the
<br>
quantity of lives that could have been saved by investing those
<br>
resources elsewhere?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Re: &quot;potential life&quot;, &quot;future life&quot; valuations.
<br>
<p>Yep, and I was in part posing the problem to see where we could
<br>
get with it.  Please note that I'm dealing with a complex perspective
<br>
which on one side has real down-to-earth impacts on the other side
<br>
is a theoretical debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Isn't it always the case that &quot;potential (more) life&quot; is under threat?
</em><br>
<p>Yep, and a recent paper by Steven Dick [USNO] deals with this as
<br>
have some posted papers to the list and it is I believe a topic that
<br>
Nick Bostrom and Milan Circovic are working on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Isn't this situation too vague, too general?  Wouldn't we be doing this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;triage&quot; all the time?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  But I suspect with regard to doing &quot;triage&quot; all the time the
<br>
answer is &quot;we are&quot;.  The problem is to acknowledge it and detail what
<br>
the best parameters might be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Secondly, how do we establish relative value between one life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and another?  This is where I think the real problem lies.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're not establishing value between one life and another, you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishing it between life and *more* life.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it was an abstract proposal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me, this just seems like an awkward way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking, &quot;What is the *absolute* value of human life?&quot;  And this is where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step outside triage, because there is no situation, there is no relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuation of human life, there's just this un-situated, absolute value.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, as I proposed the problem it could be viewed this way.
<br>
The question becomes *how* to turn it into something other than that.
<br>
That becomes a question that I do not believe that bioethicists have
<br>
dealt with but one that raises many issues.  The questions one could
<br>
offer to the list involve how do standard bioethical evaluation
<br>
considerations compare with &quot;standard&quot; extropic evaluation
<br>
considerations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, if we've established that this is *not* triage,
</em><br>
<p>Granted -- but really only because we have some incomplete definitions
<br>
with regard to what requires &quot;immediate&quot; attention, what a &quot;culture&quot;
<br>
may be, the difficulty with assigning &quot;values&quot; to human lives (both
<br>
present and future), etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with you on two points: (1) the question you're asking *is*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;extropic,&quot; inasmuch as extropy seems to embrace an idea of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (complexity, extropy) as an absolute Good and strives for its increase and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proliferation;
</em><br>
<p>That is in part how I view it -- I'm willing to look at interesting
<br>
arguments that such a position may be incorrect.  Leon Kass presents
<br>
some such counterpoints but in my opinion they do not win the debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and (2) simply invoking a base morality in response to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question doesn't quite cut it.  My own position on this is simply that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian affirmation of life/complexity/extropy is incoherent.
</em><br>
[snip]
<br>
<p>Re. complexity
<br>
<p>I would be inclined to agree.  Though complexity has reasonably good
<br>
definitions from a computer science standpoint.  Where it may lack
<br>
is in subjective areas with respect to (a) complexity that will
<br>
generate further complexity; (b) complexity that may generate more
<br>
or less complexity per unit time; (c) complexity that is &quot;good&quot;
<br>
(i.e. will not destroy humanity, the universe, etc.);
<br>
<p>So I acknowledge your comments for presenting some thought
<br>
provoking areas even if you may not have liked my initiating
<br>
thoughts.
