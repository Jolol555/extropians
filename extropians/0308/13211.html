<em>&gt; I have no doubt this, or some variation, would work. I've secretly

</em><br>

do
<br>
<em>&gt; a good job, and the water hyacinths grow extremely rapidly and provide a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ready supply of mulch for the gardens). None of the neighbors has ever
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; down the drain and kill off your aerobic bacteria. Even then, the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recovers rapidly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I've found that a more efficient and aesthetically pleasing means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of treating the byproducts of human metabolism (that is to say, shit and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pee) is to use thermophilic composting. There is no more odor than with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conventional toilet; you don't need expensive fancy contraptions; the heat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kills pathogens, even worm eggs; the process takes up very little space
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; is over with quickly -- in warm weather you go from excrement and sawdust,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead leaves, or other high-carbon waste material to beautiful soil in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of weeks. I have never used this process in town, but I used it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole time I lived on the farm. My cost to install the system was $15 for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wood, lath and cement to make a base for the seat, $3.98 for two
</em><br>
plastic
<br>
<em>&gt; buckets, and a few bucks for cinder blocks to enclose the compost pile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

I remember Damien relating a while back how he used to get his head stuck
<br>
down a dunny (translation: toilet) in grade school. I'm guessing he's glad
<br>
it wasn't your type of toilet--but rather than speculating perhaps you
<br>
should put this to the test. I've looked at commercial units that sell in
<br>
the $500 range based on the same principles as you describe. While I won't
<br>
dispute the efficiency of the breakdown, it seems to me to yield a less
<br>
useable product. I use the duckweed to feed the carp and cichlids in my
<br>
system. Duckweed is amazing--it can double its own weight under ideal
<br>
conditions. I realize that you use the night soil to fertilize, but I think
<br>
using soil is ultimately less efficient than using hydroponics (actually
<br>
aquaponics)--soil is old school man. ; ) Thanks for the feedback.
