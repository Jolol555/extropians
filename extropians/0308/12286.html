</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry Emlyn, but I have to *most* strongly disagree.  Just because a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion &quot;sucks&quot; does not mean that it may be useful to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage in it.
</em><br>
<p>It depends on why it sucks.
<br>
<p>To summarize the post, I showed that genocide, as a proposed solution to any
<br>
problem, was going to be entirely unsatisfactory, based on the extropian
<br>
principles. Further, I talked about the damage to this group, both in terms
<br>
of cohesion and PR, from its continued discussion. I asserted that it sucked
<br>
(to add a bit of heat to the light) based on the preceding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Public Broadcasting System of America offered me a good example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this last night in a program &quot;Under Orders, Under Fire&quot; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included a Harvard Law Professor (Charles Ogletree) grilling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone from military generals to congressmen to leading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalists [1].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The premise of the discussion was &quot;A soldier has a duty to serve his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country, but does that mean following orders no matter what? Should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a commander counsel - or kill - a deserting soldier?  How does a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldier protect himself from guerillas disguised as innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilians?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though I do not have a transcript for the program -- the conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did deal with issues of &quot;How many people do you lose?&quot; and &quot;How does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one lose them?&quot;.  (Interestingly the series may be over a decade old,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long before the current environment evolved.)
</em><br>
<p>That's not genocide though, it's about war, something entirely different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are another two definitions of genocide:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. &quot;the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or cultural group&quot; (Merriam-Webster online).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. &quot;the systematic killing of a whole people or nation&quot; [Webster's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New World Dictionary]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, my proposal was not in any way based on race or culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was based on a clear presentation of the value of current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. future human lives.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, it was trading off current vs future human lives, without an explicit
<br>
valuation, on an unsupported premise (that destroying countries x, y and z
<br>
will increase extropy).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that isn't trying to look at things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an extropic perspective then I don't know what is.
</em><br>
<p>..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover a NEO is going to strike the Earth in a month and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probable death toll will be half of humanity then decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to need to be made.  &quot;*Who* do we save?&quot; and &quot;*How* do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we save them?&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>Sure, yes, I agree. That's a natural disaster. God's the genocidal maniac in
<br>
that story, we're just picking up the pieces as usual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And we aren't going to have all this &quot;flak&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about &quot;genocide&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>True, because it's not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If anyone on the list thinks that major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military organizations, the Center for Disease Control, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps other security &amp; health related groups have *not*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought about scenarios (that might kill large numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people) and do not have contingency plans for this then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are simply being naive.
</em><br>
<p>Fine, but these will likely be in response to desperate situations, where it
<br>
is demostrable that the alternative is worse. Unlike your example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only thing that I am guilty of might be having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audacity to ask the question of &quot;Do the needs of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many outweigh the needs of the few?&quot; and ask it in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather controversial way.  But it is *not* an unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question (or one that should be discarded from the ExI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list) as the PBS special I cite above shows.  If PBS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can debate issues like this, then I think we should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to do so as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it's the same issue. When you discuss such a thing, it must be
<br>
in the context that the needs of the many have been clearly identified and
<br>
supported. NEO impact, killer disease outbreak vs containment, these are
<br>
relatively unambiguous. Blowing up entire countries on suspicion of
<br>
harbouring terrorists, that's something else entirely; it's genocide.
<br>
<p>btw, I couldn't find anything about the PBS program you linked to; is the
<br>
link too old?
