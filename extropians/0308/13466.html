<p><em>&gt; I wonder what are the latest thoughts regarding Aristotle's &quot;lost&quot; second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book on comedy ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently Aristotle alluded to his writings about laughter, but since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very little by him on that topic is known/found, his written work on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic of comedy and laughter are thought to be &quot;lost&quot;. At least that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I have discovered in briefly following up this subject today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anyone have more up-to-date information about Aristotle's lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book on comedy/laughter?
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. I did a google probably much the same as you would have
<br>
I expect, (or probably less adeptly), and I'm not ever sure its more than
<br>
an &quot;old&quot; urban myth.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/eh/eng/skc/artlaugh.htm">http://www.bbk.ac.uk/eh/eng/skc/artlaugh.htm</a>
<br>
Seems to be at least an academic paper on the subject written in 1998.
<br>
<p>A find on &quot;lost&quot; pulls up the following paragraph.
<br>
<p>&quot;Up until the middle of the eighteenth century, an Aristotelian conception
<br>
&nbsp;governed theories of laughter. Not that Aristotle had much to say on the
<br>
&nbsp;subject. It may be that the medieval rumour that Aristotle had written a
<br>
&nbsp;now LOST book on comedy is true: but judging from the little that Aristotle
<br>
&nbsp;has to say on the subject of comedy in the rest of his work, it does not
<br>
&nbsp;seem likely to have been a very substantial work. Aristotle shares with
<br>
Plato the idea that laughter is derision, or the expression of superiority.
<br>
Aristotle saw laughter as proceeding from `the joy we have in observing
<br>
&nbsp;the fact that we cannot be hurt by the evil at which we are indignant'.
<br>
&nbsp;Insofar as we tend to laugh at the lowly and the undignified (what is ugly
<br>
&nbsp;without being offensive, as Aristotle says, in an interesting prefiguring
<br>
of
<br>
&nbsp;aesthetic language), laughter should be kept within bounds, since laughing
<br>
&nbsp;too much at what is ridiculous or unbecoming starts to put your own
<br>
dignity on the line. Aristotle is here in concord with Plato, who
<br>
recommended the banning of depictions of gods or heroes doubled up
<br>
&nbsp;in laughter on the grounds that it was unbecoming and conducive to
<br>
disrespect for the divine.&quot;
<br>
-----
<br>
<p>How far did you get towards concluding there might actually have
<br>
been such a book?
<br>
<p>For some reason that I don't get, the formal study of laughter has never
<br>
really intrigued, as much as it should. The last time I heard of &quot;a theory
<br>
of emotion&quot; Schacter was it's proponent. Curiously he argued (if memory
<br>
serves) that we sense &quot;something&quot; as a sort of arousal then look around
<br>
to the world for context on how to interpret or label that feeling of
<br>
arousal
<br>
back to ourselves. This creates an opportunity for quick suggestive types
<br>
like comics and rhetoricians.
<br>
<p>When rhetoric was in vogue in Rome and Greece the study of the power
<br>
of ridicule in debate must have reached a pretty fair level.
<br>
<p>Based on Schacter's notions I reckon a very good way to move a
<br>
crowd inclined to laugh at ridicule may be a quick rejoinder that moves
<br>
them instead to another emotion like pity or regret.
<br>
<p>Consider Mark Antony's speach in Shakespeares Julius Ceasar. &quot;I come
<br>
to bury Ceasar not to praise him&quot; etc. Antony seduces a crowd to action
<br>
with words that are superficially accolades about &quot;honorable men&quot; yet
<br>
plants the suggestion incrementally that the honorable men are anything
<br>
but.
<br>
<p>I reckon something may turn on the way we mentally process &quot;nots&quot; and
<br>
&quot;negatives&quot;. We consider propositions in the affirmative and then it takes
<br>
another &quot;CPU cycle&quot; to add the &quot;not&quot; or the logical reversal in there.
<br>
Maybe the switch is dramatic from one part of the brain (imagery) and
<br>
yet subtle from another (linguistic) and laughter thus comes as a release
<br>
as the parts come together.
<br>
<p>Or maybe not :-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
