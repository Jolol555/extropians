<p>
I notice that a flaw which clouds a lot of Extropic thinking is the
<br>
sociological equivalent of repeatedly designing perpetual motion machines.
<br>
<p>For example we obviously have the theoretical capability to send humans
<br>
to Mars right now, and probably have had that capability since the 60's
<br>
(some aerospace buff please correct me if I'm off on this). Why has this not
<br>
happened already? Is it because &quot;people&quot; are &quot;stupid&quot;?
<br>
<p>Perhaps, but it's not a useful way of framing the question. If your machine
<br>
doesn't work due to minute impurities in the materials, turbulent fluid
<br>
behavior, moisture due to condensation, or frictional heat... you could by the
<br>
same reasoning say that it's the machine's own fault because it's stupid. But
<br>
that won't get you any closer to a functional design.
<br>
<p>I propose that there's a difference between being
<br>
stubborn/irrational/superstitious/short-sighted... and recognizing that
<br>
stubbornness/irrationality/superstitions/short-sightedness are real phenomena
<br>
that must be factored in when trying to bring about any changes that involve
<br>
the participation of humans. What I'd love to see some social-science people
<br>
(shut up conservatrolls, economics is a social science too) attempt a rigorous
<br>
analysis of human resistance to change. Extrotopia just ain't gonna happen if
<br>
there's ideas but no money or favorable policy climate in which to implement
<br>
them... if there's a destination but no optimal path to get there from here.
