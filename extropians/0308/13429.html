<p>What do you think &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; means from below?
<br>
<p>The pretty pictures you see on TV of nice lights lighting up the desert

<p>That we are not ALL completely horrified that there were two wars that

didn't need to happen is a sign that in fact we are already living in

Die Neue Reichstadt and that a Hitler-Like character has already taken
