<em>&gt; &gt; I hope that others are coming around to seeing our nation as a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parties to this contract are the citizens of this nation.  Non
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizens are NOT parties to this particular contract.  In part, the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not compete for the benefits of citizenship, unless they &quot;buy in&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a sufficient amount.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I see communitarian thinking, in-group protection, outgroup bashing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here. Where is the Extropian content?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you deny me, Rafal Smigrodzki, a productive non-citizen, the benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or maybe the right?) of bargaining for a mutually beneficial exchange of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; services with American citizens?
</em><br>
<p><p>How about if you and I and several other business partners develop a product, 
<br>
then you turn around and sell the trade secrets relating to the product to a 
<br>
competitor. You make out big time and I lose out big time. Oh wait, I forgot--
<br>
because the competitor did not have to spend the money and time to develop 
<br>
the product (just the money he gave you), he can sell the product more 
<br>
cheaply than our company would have.  Less development expenses, etc.
<br>
<p>And now, you say, in reply, I (and the other partners) can buy that product 
<br>
more cheaply than before. If I can make enough at Walmart to buy the product, 
<br>
of course.
<br>
<p>Gee, business partner, please don't do me any more &quot;favors.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, not to put too fine a point (guess I do have to do that...), as an 
<br>
analogy, we Americans and our ancestors built this country into a place with 
<br>
tremendous competitive advantages: we as voters control and have exclusive 
<br>
labor market access to the biggest consumer market ever.  That means that we 
<br>
can charge far more when we sell our labor here in the USA to labor buyers 
<br>
who want to sell products to this enormous consumer market.  Compare to third 
<br>
worlders, for example.
<br>
<p>Or, at least we SHOULD have exclusive labor market access. Instead, those 
<br>
entities who BUY labor have convinced us that by giving up this exclusive 
<br>
labor market access, we can get those products more cheaply. That is, if we 
<br>
can save enough at Walmart to buy the product.
<br>
<p>The way they go at it is by dividing the populace/business partners: make 
<br>
them think it will always happen to that mythical &quot;other guy.&quot;  The only 
<br>
ramifications to &quot;me&quot; will be lower cost.
<br>
<p>Gee, &quot;business partner,&quot; please don't do me any more &quot;favors.&quot;
