<p>Kevin, you are correct that the &quot;traditional&quot; habitable zone has been
<br>
somewhat restricted.  But this work is probably about 20 or more years
<br>
old now.
<br>
<p>As more work has become known about carbon cycles, heat radiation
<br>
from planets, warming from external sources (like gravity for
<br>
Europa) the concept of a strict habitable zone has become less
<br>
&quot;fixed&quot;.  Even the galactic habitable zone as well as the planetary
<br>
habitable zone may shift with time (Milan Cirkovic and I are
<br>
discussing preparing a paper on this).
<br>
<p>The problem currently isn't really the habitable zone but the state
<br>
of the technology -- we cannot currently locate planets significantly
<br>
less than the mass of Saturn.  But there are some improvements in
<br>
technology and several space missions that may push us down to
<br>
Earth mass planets within the next decade or so.
<br>
<p>The stakes are very high within the astronomy and physics communities
<br>
as well as at NASA and the European Space Agency.  The discovery of
<br>
an Earth mass planet, especially in a &quot;traditional&quot; habitable zone,
<br>
would be front page news on the New York Times (as well as hundreds
<br>
of other papers) -- so you can place money on the fact that there
<br>
are hundreds, if not thousands, of people working on making this
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>As the list of papers posted by Amara (thank you very much Amara)
<br>
points out -- people are working overtime to see just how far
<br>
one can extend the &quot;habitable zone&quot; concepts.
<br>
<p>Also, people are not limiting searches to the &quot;traditional&quot; habitable
<br>
zone.  The searches currently detect planets based on mass (or in some cases
<br>
size).  They do not focus on location within a habitable zone.  Because of the
<br>
way the searches work they are biased towards detecting planets that
<br>
are very large and orbit very close to their stars.  So of the 100 or
<br>
so exoplanets detected thus far the sample set is somewhat atypical
<br>
relative to what is actually &quot;out there&quot;.
<br>
