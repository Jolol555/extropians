Most of your info was reasonable I think except this astounding bit:

<p>Huh?  I can feed a familly of four 50 meals/month in a restaurant on that kind 
<br>
of money!   I can and have fed a family of four on $500/month.  You don't go 
<br>
out much and avoid a lot of over-priced junk in the diet but it just ain't 
<br>
that hard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking of health care - THEN there was a local doctor who would do

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry but this claim that we are dying at alarming rates from old diseases 
<br>
if we are not in the top 5% is way over the top.  Facts and figures please.  
<br>
Accidental death is new?  Heart disease is new?   I am confused by your 
<br>
wording.
