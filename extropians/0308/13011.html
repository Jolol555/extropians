<em>&gt; It would be interesting to speculate how much the &quot;run-up&quot; to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>My opinion about the cause is fundamentally that the mind abhors a vaccuum.  
<br>
American culture has become pretty devoid of much real sense of purpose or 
<br>
values beyond consumerism and &quot;making it&quot;.    The lack of substance is very 
<br>
palpable to many.    Anything that seems to fill the void is an attractor.    
<br>
Religions are good at filling or seeming to fill this void.  Add to this 
<br>
increasingly rapid change and economic uncertainty and new post 9/11 levels 
<br>
of fear and you have a very potent brew.   
<br>
<p>Now, transhumanist values and goals could also fill some of this void quite 
<br>
nicely.  But they are a bit more work to understand and embrace, and frankly,  
<br>
we are not anywhere near as good at selling.  
<br>
<p>Another factor I am very sorry to have to acknowledge is that America has  
<br>
been dumbed down on purpose.  With a non-black illteracy rate of 14% and 
<br>
black illteracy rate as high as 40% the problem begins to show itself.   
<br>
Polls of the lack of knowledge about the world among Americans, even very 
<br>
simply knowledge your average 6th grader would know, are commonplace.   
<br>
Another poll reports that over 50% of college graduates report that they did 
<br>
not read another book after they graduated no matter how many years ago that 
<br>
was.  
<br>
<p>Massive sense of meaningless, lack of training in reasoning and logic, large 
<br>
doses of subjectivism and cultural relativism among the educated, uncertanty 
<br>
about the future - it all adds up to high vulnerability for comforting 
<br>
comprehensive memes.   And yes, it also tends toward distrust of and anger 
<br>
toward the intellect as much of the imbibed intellectual fashion of the day 
<br>
taught fundamental meaninglessness and subjectivity and arbitrariness of all 
<br>
values and value systems.   The distrust of the intellect is because of what 
<br>
the intellectuals tell them and because using the intellect would seriously 
<br>
threaten the new found comfort memes.
