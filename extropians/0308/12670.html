<p>
I feel I have to recommend the paper &quot;Thinking the unthinkable:
<br>
sacred values and taboo cognitions&quot; (Tetlock, Trends in cognitive
<br>
sciences, vol 7, no 7 2003, p 320--325) that was mentioned earlier
<br>
for the entire list. It is one of those eye openers that makes you 
<br>
see the overall pattern in stuff you earlier was vaguely aware of.
<br>
<p>The basic idea is the cognitive science of sacred values. Something
<br>
is sacred when it is absolute and involable, and the mere thought of
<br>
trading it off for some secular value is abhorrent. Different
<br>
societies have different sacredness, but all societies have it. In
<br>
practice we always have to do trade-offs between values. As an
<br>
example, how much do we want to pay for road safety? If human lives
<br>
were infinitely valuable to us, we would gladly pay all money we
<br>
could for safer roads. But we actually chose (or have someone chose
<br>
for us) a finite amount. But actually being tempted or forced to
<br>
make these compromises makes us uncomfortable, and various escape
<br>
and coping mechanisms (such as 'moral cleansing' where people do
<br>
something they consider moral to balance the trade - we feel
<br>
contaminated by trading in the sacred). These taboo tradeoffs cause
<br>
strong moral outrage, especially among observers. It is seen as
<br>
unacceptable to trade something sacred for secular, or even to
<br>
consider it. 
<br>
<p>Empirical research show that there was considerable agreement on
<br>
sacred values between conservative republicans and liberal
<br>
democrats. But Tetlock observes that libertarians accept extending
<br>
market-pricing into areas other consider taboo, and socialists want
<br>
to extend the taboo of market pricing to medical care, legal counsel
<br>
and housing. This has great importance for us transhumanists (and
<br>
libertarians). We have accepted the non-taboo nature of many things
<br>
like genetic modification of humans. But when we discuss the reasons
<br>
to do (or not do) them, we frame it in terms of secular
<br>
cost/benefit, breaking the taboo for many outsiders. This is a
<br>
strong reason why much normal discussion on this list is seen as
<br>
abhorrent by many: we share a different set of the sacred, and this
<br>
causes a deep rift of understanding. This is important to hold in 
<br>
mind. 
<br>
<p>It turns out that it is more OK to make a sacred-sacred trade
<br>
(&quot;tragic trade-offs&quot;): it is the stuff of greek dramas and ethical
<br>
dilemmas. Freedom versus loyalty. Family versus duty. And so on. 
<br>
Moral judgements about a hospital administrator having to chose 
<br>
between the life of a patient and saving one million dollars showed 
<br>
that people lauded the administrator who chose to save the life 
<br>
(sacred value) over the money (secular), and much more strongly if 
<br>
the decision was described as fast. The administrator who took time 
<br>
to weigh the issue was seen as less praiseworthy even when he 
<br>
decided to save the life (the administrator who chose money quickly 
<br>
was of course the worst of the lot). But if it was a tragic 
<br>
trade-off (saving a life versus curing AIDS, say), then the 
<br>
administrator who lingered before making the decision was seen as 
<br>
more praiseworthy than the one who just did one thing. Compare this 
<br>
to the usual call for more careful thinking that nearly always ends 
<br>
a statement of bioethics. 
<br>
<p>It turns out that framing a trade-off as a tragic trade-off rather 
<br>
than a taboo trade decreases moral outrage. If the PAM affair had 
<br>
not been framed as the taboo tradeoff between money and human lives 
<br>
but instead as a tragic trade-off between the need for knowledge and 
<br>
having to use money in &quot;dirty&quot; ways (or even better, as a secular 
<br>
trade-off between money and knowledge), the outrage would have been 
<br>
smaller. Similarly we transhumanists should try to frame our visions 
<br>
in terms of what is sacred when we are proposing taboo-breaking 
<br>
(&quot;Yes, modifying the genome changes the &quot;order of nature&quot;. But to do 
<br>
otherwise would block human freedom and well being!&quot;) or seek to 
<br>
show the different sacred landscape we are experiencing (although 
<br>
this is much harder). 
<br>
<p>All in all, a very good article.
