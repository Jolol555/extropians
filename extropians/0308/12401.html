Actually, I have never been all that good at
<br>
manipulation of symbols as such.  I was really
<br>
terrible at trying to prove the limit theorems in
<br>
honors calculus, for example, and I have great
<br>
difficulty even remembering purely symbolic material. 
<br>
For example, it is a absolutely horrendus task for me
<br>
to memorize a poem, altho I can recall the meaning,
<br>
tone, implications, etc., quite well, indeed.  There
<br>
are songs I play fifty or a hundred times as workout
<br>
tapes, and I couldn't tell you the lyrics for the life
<br>
of me, but I CAN whistle or hum them and be dead on.  
<br>
<p>However, although I have a lousy symbolic memory, I
<br>
can hold a kind of kinesthetic model of statements in
<br>
my mind, and work with that model intuitively to yield
<br>
proofs.  The formal logic that I could handle so well
<br>
in college involved statements and their
<br>
relationships.  I am really good at detecting failures
<br>
of implication, which is also how I scored so high on
<br>
the SAT's GRE's etc...  Just eliminate the
<br>
non-answers...  What's left has to be true - or what
<br>
the testors want to see selected.

<p>As an aside; doctors have come up with a &quot;disorder&quot;
<br>
for people who excel at symbolic manipulations...
<br>
they're calling it hyperlexia. Personally I think
<br>
they're correct (insofar as the description and
<br>
general consequences), but incorrect in ascribing to
<br>
it a disorder status. How much is genetic vs
<br>
environmental is another issue...I do believe though,
<br>
that there are people who are inherently better symbol
<br>
manipulators than others. &gt;
