<em>&gt;&gt; Were we FORCED to go to war?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes
</em><br>
<p>I guess I'm interested in knowing the meaning of &quot;forced&quot; you have in 
<br>
mind here.  I know time is short, what's the 30-second version?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It's not like I'm asking you to analyze the structure of human freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in its cultural dimension across temporal and sociological borders or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; something.
</em><br>
<p>I guess maybe I AM asking you to analyze the structure of human 
<br>
freedom.   I realize time is short - if you want me to chase down some 
<br>
isms - determinism, objectivism, etc., I'm perfectly happy and capable. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully it's possible to explain how we were &quot;forced&quot; without 
<br>
dragging down some really big heavy books.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You'll agree it's quite difficult to do so when subjects like this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't you?
</em><br>
<p>Definitely, but here we are, doing it!  Yeah!!!!
<br>
You haven't called me stupid and I haven't called you stupid yet.
<br>
We're doing pretty good!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Perfection is valueless without moral perfection.  I would say, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; only worthwhile augmentation pursuit would be the moral one and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; OUGHT to have longevity-producing and human-improving side effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now in this we're in perfect agreement.  How we'd go about defining 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be perfected, aye, there's the rub.
</em><br>
<p>Great, it sounds like we have a lot of common places to start.  And it 
<br>
even sounds like it's an extropian issue.  The question can be a 
<br>
hypothetical one if you prefer it:
<br>
<p>Would a risk-averse morally-ideal-machine-person have a pre-emptive war 
<br>
strategy, would they be pure pragmatists, would they be peaceniks?
<br>
<p>In modern GenX terms, what would Brian Boytano do?
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
