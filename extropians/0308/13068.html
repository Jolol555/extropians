<p>
I'm glad you pointed out the two distinct lists, there is the Nanogirl News
<br>
list (just news) and the Nanotech list (news and discussion). This model has
<br>
worked very well for myself and the members of the two differing lists.
<br>
Originally I had just the one list that had not only the news but was also
<br>
open to discussion (which is still in the form of the Nanotech list).
<br>
Unfortunately this forced acceptance by members who were only interested in
<br>
the latest news to also fill up there inbox with messages they were not
<br>
interested in or just did not have time to read or respond to (this leads to
<br>
unsubscribers), this was the birth of the separate lists. By providing these
<br>
two options members are not lost, they can find their own comfort zone.
<br>
Maintaining email lists is not as easy as it may seem, especially when the
<br>
group is large and consists of many opinions and intellects. My list's
<br>
subject of nanotech is more narrow than the topics discussed here on the
<br>
extropy list, this creates even more complexity.  I would like to think that
<br>
as a code I do not like censorship, when I began my list, I would not deny
<br>
any post with free speech as a priority. However this code has been broken
<br>
and I have been at times forced to intervene as moderator. I do not like to,
<br>
as it would be a much easier world to keep everyone happy, this however can
<br>
occasionally be, impossible. At times things have been submitted that appear
<br>
to be spam in disguise, here in lies the approval issue.  I recall an
<br>
incident where profane insults were being thrown around and the discussion
<br>
wavered from the topic of the list, the focus was lost. Since I would like
<br>
my list to be appropriate for everyone (my email group settings in fact
<br>
specify that the group is appropriate for all ages), as the nanotech meme is
<br>
imperative to those of all ages, including youth, I had to express my
<br>
concern to the list and suggest (warnings that other members don't see can
<br>
be ignored) that the argument move somewhere else more appropriate. I was
<br>
very happy that everything was quickly resolved. Of course the Nanogirl News
<br>
list, is extremely easy to maintain, since only the news is distributed.
<br>
There has never been a problem. The few I have had on the other list, were
<br>
minor and worth going through to be able to enjoy the full experience of the
<br>
list. I suggest that the rarity of occurrences on my list, since 1998 are
<br>
still very good statistics. This must be accounted for on such a high
<br>
density of members on this list as well. This list is very open and very
<br>
patient, I know.  I don't know what exactly is going on here or what has
<br>
been said, I've been so busy that I'm not reading everything, I've only
<br>
caught bits and pieces. I just thought I would share my experience regarding
<br>
maintaining lists since they were mentioned. We discuss the big questions on
<br>
this list, for that we should be proud. There's nothing else like here
<br>
(there's no place like home!). Gina Miller`

<em>&gt; &gt; We have two choices: either no list moderation, which leads to an

<em>&gt; &gt; unacceptable degradation of list quality; or some form of coercion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used to enforce list rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Add my personal preference and a third choice:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We create two lists.  One is a discussion list and is wholly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely unmoderated.  The other is a moderated (announce-only style)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, where only a few people can send to the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Generally, everyone is encouraged to subscribe to the moderated list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which should be low traffic (less than 10 messages a day).  Anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wishes to participate in discussion subscribes to the discussion list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discussion threads start on the discussion list, where everyone can put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their two cents.  When the thread reaches a point where it's either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting or has terminated, someone (not necessarily a participant in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thread -- the volunteer can be anyone) then summarizes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highlights of the thread that might be interesting.  They then send that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summary to one of the moderators of the moderated list who collate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day's summaries, then sends it out to the moderated list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This way, folks who don't want to (or can't) sift through the noise get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to at least see what they might have missed.  Then, they can optionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go back through some threaded message archive and read up on the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread if they want deeper detail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is similar to what folks like Gina are doing with the Nanogirl
</em><br>
<em>&gt; News, but would be specific to the content represented in the Extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mailing list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a widely used technique for many mailing lists and Usenet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newsgroups and works well, as long as there are enough volunteers who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summarize worthwhile threads.
