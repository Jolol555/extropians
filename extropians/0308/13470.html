</em><br>
<p>No -- because I'm sick to death of hearing the same things over and over and
<br>
over again and, much more importantly, this just isn't the place to argue
<br>
about whether the Bush administration's foreign policy is right or whether
<br>
they are &quot;Nazis.&quot;  That's not hard to undertand, is it?  I'm sure you've got
<br>
lots of opportunities to make your point in fora that are devoted to
<br>
politics.  Why here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I am aware that controlling dialogue with value-laden terms is an
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; control the context of dialogues.
</em><br>
<p>Please -- neither side of the left/right dichotomy has any kind of monopoly
<br>
on the use of value-laden terms.  Some of my friends sat through &quot;struggle
<br>
sessions&quot; in the Cultural Revolution in China.  Don't you think there was
<br>
&quot;dialogue control&quot; with &quot;value-laden terms&quot; going on there?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is why such conversations tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drift quickly into how unoriginal, contentious, uninformed, unhappy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half-hearted, uncivil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left-leaning and liberal anyone who doesn't believe everything they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear on Fox News or Ayn Rand said is.
</em><br>
<p>Please see the recent criticism of Fox at my blog.  The list of things I
<br>
disagree with Ayn Rand about is pretty long, too.  The problem is that
<br>
discussion of subjects like the one in this thread tends to push people into
<br>
characterizing their opponents as 2-dimensional icons.  I did it.  You did
<br>
it. It sucks.  We've got better things to do here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm happy to abort too if we can agree on the factual points I made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my original post to which you found it important enough to respond:
</em><br>
<p>We most certainly CAN'T agree, which is why this discussion is pointless
<br>
here.  Imagine the volume of text it would take for each of us to set out
<br>
our positions in detail on these matters.  Imagine the effort it would take
<br>
to refrain from name-calling, and the consequences for the list when we fail
<br>
to do so.  Now compare that to more productive discussions we could have
<br>
here that we're unlikely to have elsewhere.  The volumes of text and the
<br>
name-calling can be found lots of places; discussion of human augmentation
<br>
can't.
