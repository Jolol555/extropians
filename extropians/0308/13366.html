<p>
<em>&gt; In all the discussion of alternate and renewable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy sources, the problem of energy storage is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought out.  A quiet assumption runs thru all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the discussion that I have seen, the assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the price of electricity must remain nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant.  Do think about this however.  Energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplies may be controlled by allowing the price 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of power at any given time to float to whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels necessary to reduce demand.  On sunny,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blowy days, the actual price of energy might fall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to practically nothing, whereas it might be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive on dark still days, when the power would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be supplied by expensive peaker plants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By insisting that power prices be nearly constant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *we all pay more* since peaker plants are costly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to operate and produce very pricy power part time, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the market mandates to be sold at the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price as non-peak power, and the supply must always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient to cover the demand.  Result:  everyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total power bill is higher than they would be if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would collectively tolerate wildly fluctuating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices and occasional shortages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If power were to be sold at the real-time price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it costs to make it, then the proletariat would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjust its collective behavior, charging batteries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when power is cheap, and turning off the air 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditioners when power is expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spike
</em><br>
<p>That's a sensible sounding suggestion, but we (consumers) don't have enough
<br>
information to make it work. I've watched power prices fluctuate when I was
<br>
working in a power station, and I've seen them temporarily increase by a
<br>
factor of 60 at extreme times. 
<br>
<p>For consumers to be able to weather true deregulation, we need to be able to
<br>
know the price at any moment. Maybe a website would be ok, except you need
<br>
to use power to access it :-) I'm not sure how to deliver this information,
<br>
but the alternative is that you consume a product whose price is entirely
<br>
unknown to you (and currently unknowable I think, in realtime), and which
<br>
can move so quickly and extremely that you could be severely disadvantaged
<br>
(wiped out maybe!) by normal market fluctuations.
