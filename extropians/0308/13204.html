<p>
<em>&gt; I would like to see someone cite some Google references on the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land area required to produce 2500 calories per day.  (There seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a lot of hand waving going on here).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To coin a phrase: it depends. It just so happens that we were discussing
<br>
something tangentially related to this across the street at wta-talk. Here's
<br>
the relevant part:
<br>
<p>Is it possible to &quot;close the loop&quot; within
<br>
the confines of a city. By this I mean grow all the food for the city
<br>
residents and recycle all human waste.  Here's my back of the envelope
<br>
calculations to say
<br>
that this might be possible: Take central Toronto as an example of a densely
<br>
populated &quot;modern&quot; city.
<br>
<p>Land area per person = 264 m2 (density of 3,788 per km2).
<br>
(<a href="http://www.demographia.com/db-toronto-ward.htm">http://www.demographia.com/db-toronto-ward.htm</a> )
<br>
<p>Food can be grown by using an aquaponic set-up. Aquaponics uses fish waste
<br>
to grow plant matter, and growing plants to clean the fish water. Based on
<br>
research (both theoretical and practical see www.permanentend.org ) it is
<br>
possible to grow enough food for a person in a space that is 6m2. So for a
<br>
single person you might have a 2000 liter pond filled with about 100kg of
<br>
carp or tilapia. Water from the pond is used to irrigate plants grown
<br>
hydroponically above the fish pond. The hydroponic beds are made of crushed
<br>
stone--no soil is used in the system. The energy for this sort of system is
<br>
quite minimal--the pumps use about 40/watt hr per person, which could easily
<br>
be supplied by solar or wind energy. This handles the inputs, our food, what
<br>
about the outputs? Based on calculations from
<br>
<a href="http://www.prismusa.homestead.com/files/Duckweed.htm">http://www.prismusa.homestead.com/files/Duckweed.htm</a> (see for derivation
<br>
<a href="http://www.permanentend.org/home.html">http://www.permanentend.org/home.html</a> under resources) a 3m2 pond should be
<br>
sufficiently large to
<br>
process the waste of a single human. The idea would be to grow duckweed in
<br>
these ponds, dry
<br>
it, and then feed it to the carp closing the loop. Waste water that is
<br>
processed with duckweed is far cleaner than what comes out of modern sewage
<br>
plants. In fact the water is drinkable if you run it through a uv
<br>
sterilizer.
<br>
<p>Bottom line then is that an optimistic figure of 9m2 per person to process
<br>
all food and waste. (Of course I'm not suggesting that everyone ought to
<br>
grow their own food--aquaponics lends itself to the division of labor and
<br>
automation even more so than traditional agriculture).
<br>
<p>Of course this figure is optimistic in someways, e.g., even under glass (or
<br>
plastic) growth would be seasonal (without enormous external energy inputs)
<br>
in some cities like Toronto.
<br>
This could in part be ameliorated by increasing the size of food and waste
<br>
facilities and grow more in the warmer seasons. So even if the calculations
<br>
are optimistic by an order of magnitude it would still be possible for
<br>
Toronto to grow its own food and process its own waste in a closed loop
<br>
within the confines of its present geography. Obviously this would require
<br>
redesigning the city, e.g., houses might be built with roofs capable of
<br>
supporting an aquaponic facility. Roadways might be covered with a canopy to
<br>
allow sewage ponds on top to grow duckweed, etc.
<br>
<p>As far as I can see, there is no principled biological or engineering reason
<br>
why such a city could not be built, really what we lack is the political
<br>
will.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
