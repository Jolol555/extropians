Excellent post! Right in line with my recent thoughts.  This really belies 
<br>
the growing neoconservative &quot;arbeit mach frei&quot; propaganda that has helped 
<br>
lead to the increasing age at which one may draw SS benefits (was 62, now 65, 
<br>
soon to be 67).  We need to take a look at what we are doing, and decrease 
<br>
the SS eligible age even if we have to greatly reduce benefits.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The pension funds in many large corporations (e.g., Boeing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lockheed Martin, AT&amp;T, Lucent Technologies, etc.) have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been &quot;Over Funded&quot; because many &quot;late retirees&quot; who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep-on working into their old age and retire late after the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age of 65 tend to die within two years after their retirements. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, many of these late retirees do not live long 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to collect all their fair shares of pension money such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they leave a lot of extra-unused money in the pension 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funds resulting in the over-funded pension funds. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Ephrem provided the important results in the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Table 1 and the associated chart from an actuarial study of life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; span vs. age at retirement. The study was based on the number 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pension checks sent to retirees of Boeing Aerospace.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;          65.2                         66.8 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Table 1 and the chart indicate that for people retired at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age of 50, their average life span is 86; whereas for people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retired at the age of 65, their average life span is only 66.8. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An important conclusion from this study is that for every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year one works beyond age 55, one loses 2 years of life span 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on average. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Boeing experience is that employees retiring at age of 65
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receive pension checks for only 18 months, on average, prior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to death.  Similarly, the Lockheed experience is that employees 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retiring at age of 65 receive pension checks for only 17 months, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on average, prior to death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. David T. Chai indicated that the Bell Labs experience is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to those of Boeing and Lockheed based on the casual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation from the Newsletters of Bell Lab retirees.  A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retiree from Ford Motor told Dr. Paul Tien-Lin Ho that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience from Ford Motor is also similar to those in Boeing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Lockheed. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The statistics shown in the Pre-Retirement Seminar in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Telcordia (Bellcore) indicates that the average age that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Telcordia (Bellcore) employees start retirement is 57. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, people who retire at the age of 65 or older are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minority as compared to the number of early retirees. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The hard-working late retirees probably put too much stress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on their aging body-and-mind such that they are so stressed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to develop various serious health problems that forced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to quit and retire.  With such long-term stress-induced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious health problems, they die within two years after they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quit and retire. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, people who take early retirements at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age of 55 tend to live long and well into their 80s and beyond. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These earlier retirees probably are either wealthier or more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to plan and manage their various aspects of their life, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health and career well such that they can afford to retire early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and comfortably. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These early retirees are not really idling after their early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retirements to get old. They still continue doing some work. But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do the work on the part-time basis at a more leisure pace 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that they do not get too stressed out. Furthermore, they have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the luxury to pick and chose the types of part-time work of real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest to them so that they can enjoy and love doing that &quot;fun&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work at a more leisure pace. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The late retirees are small in number, tend to die quickly after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retirement and disappear from the population of old people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the age of 70.  Late retirees, therefore, have very little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight on the statistical average life expectancy of the population 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;old people&quot; dominated by the early retirees. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conclusion and Recommendations  - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you get older, you should plan your career path and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financial matters so that you can retire comfortably at the age 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 55 or earlier to enjoy your long, happy and leisure retirement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life into your golden age of 80s and beyond. In retirement, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can still enjoy some fun work of great interest to you and of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great values to the society and the community, but at a part-time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leisure pace on your own term. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, if you are not able to get out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure-cooker or the high-speed battleground at the age of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 55 and &quot;have&quot; to keep on working very hard until the age of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 65 or older before your retirement,  then you probably will die 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within 18 months of retirement. By working very hard in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure cooker for 10 more years beyond the age of 55, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give up at least 20 years of your life span on average.
