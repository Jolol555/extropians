</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; will get about 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miles on a charge. Suppose on those occasions where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you need to travel more
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a little robot would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pull out your spent batteries and replace them with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charged ones.
</em><br>
<p>The standard keyphrase for this is &quot;distribution
<br>
system&quot;.  Put simply: how do you get those stations
<br>
set up in the first place?  (Yes, there are gas
<br>
stations now, but how do you pay for refitting those
<br>
with the robots you mention prior to enough people
<br>
having these cars to make it economically viable?  A
<br>
chicken-and-the-egg type problem.)
<br>
<p>Much the same problem faces hydrogen-powered fuel
<br>
cells, which have much the same characteristics as
<br>
batteries (at least as matters to cars: fuel cells
<br>
breathe air, but this matters not in this
<br>
application; they exhaust water vapor instead of
<br>
nothing, but this also makes no diff to cars) except
<br>
they have higher power storage densities (thus
<br>
allowing longer trips between refuelling).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As it is now, I've got to make a weekly stop at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gas station, so this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setup would definitely be more convenient. I'd love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to come home and simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plug-in.
</em><br>
<p>Having operated an EV1 before they were scrapped, I
<br>
can tell you that your dream - in this regard - is
<br>
right-on.  Granted, I had to plug in every few nights
<br>
(battery range over 100 miles, daily round-trip
<br>
commute under 50) or I'd be out of fuel, but it was
<br>
an easy habit to get in to.  (I still remember a
<br>
friend's joke about the power meter: an 11-bar gauge
<br>
showing how full the battery was.  &quot;Bars of power&quot;
<br>
sounded a little like I was powering it with cocaine
<br>
or similar, but what else could one call it, simply
<br>
enough for daily usage?)
<br>
<p>One of the problems was, most people apparently did
<br>
(still do) much more than 100 miles of driving per
<br>
day, and in many cases, the only practical place to
<br>
plug in was at home.  There were other chargers, but
<br>
not even 10% - probably not even 1% - as many per
<br>
unit area as gas stations, and charging was a slow
<br>
enough process that it really had to be at some place
<br>
you were going to be at for several hours - which
<br>
usually meant work or home.  Battery swapping robots
<br>
would have solved the latter part of that, but then
<br>
you get into liability issues if a broken battery
<br>
gets swapped in which doesn't fail until you're 10
<br>
miles from civilization and 40 miles from a charger.
