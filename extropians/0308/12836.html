<p>Anders, if you happen to have a standard reference on this I'd
<br>
like to know what it is.  (Don't go to any trouble with it, I
<br>
can probably Google it.)  Its been a number of years (probably
<br>
decades) since I've looked at the core of &quot;information theory&quot;
<br>
so I'm a bit rusty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The question is how the mutual information between the DNA and the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; purely from codons; this is the real measure of how much information

</em><br>
<p>The RNA modifications may not be too different from post-translational
<br>
modifications such as glycosylation or perhaps modifications performed
<br>
by kinases or other enzymes that add additional atoms or molecules.
<br>
But it seems like there is a &quot;multiplier effect&quot; in that a single enzyme
<br>
could enhance the information content of a number of different proteins.
<br>
<p>I also am not sure that a simple information content analysis based
<br>
on base probability will work because the &quot;multiplier effect&quot; probably
<br>
often works on the 3D structure and that *isn't* obvious from a
<br>
simple analysis of the DNA/RNA.  One would need a much higher level
<br>
analysis of what 3D &quot;words&quot; mean.  There are protein structure and
<br>
protein motif databases with some of this information but I don't
<br>
believe we are anywhere near understanding the complete &quot;language&quot;.
