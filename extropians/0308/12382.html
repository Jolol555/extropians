Bleh, sent this early by accident...
<br>
<p>From what I gathered solely from that web page,
<br>
he's arguing that calculus is the equivalent of broken,
<br>
in that there is no such physical analogue as a time slice
<br>
in relation to objects in motion.  That would include 
<br>
digitization as well.  He's basically stating that comparing
<br>
any two objects in motion is pointless, since at best, we
<br>
are comparing an avg rather than an instant in time.  
<br>
<p>Its a practicality argument, more than anything else.
<br>
Anybody who tries to apply calculus to events already
<br>
runs into these problems and approximates.  He's saying
<br>
the equivalent of &quot;the map is not the territory&quot;; just because
<br>
we think its been discretized properly does not mean it has
<br>
{ergo error}, and does not mean it can... His work, of course,
<br>
assumes that there is no fundamental slice in time....

Subject: Re: Ground-breaking work in understanding of time
<br>
<p><p>When this was announced a few days ago I was curious, so I downloaded
<br>
both papers of Lynds are read them. Perhaps I did not understand
<br>
anything of what he is trying to say, but I was not impressed. It seems
<br>
to me that he is assuming from the very beginning what he wants to
<br>
prove, and that he is not explaining why the standard view of these
<br>
things (that we learn in first year calculus) is wrong.
