<em>&gt; .. in my opinion, anybody who says the statement that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are acting morally in a pre-emptive fashion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harms others, regardless of  the effect, is immoral; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insofar as no event has occurred to justify said &quot;response&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I cannot agree with this statement as a generalisation, as there
<br>
<p>are some classes of pre-emptive action made on 
<br>
the basis of genuinely held, earnestly reasoned (note I 
<br>
am not touching *belief* here) views that would require
<br>
action in my view. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; trying to justify a pre-emptive measure on the notion
<br>
that is &quot;genuinely held&quot; or &quot;earnestly reasoned&quot; is a rationalization
<br>
in my opinion, generally to excuse the type of behavior you
<br>
are engaging in... the limit on this line of reasoning though,
<br>
is in the duration of the act.... for instance, say you were prescient,
<br>
and saw a man who was going to mug you (with a knife) 10 minutes 
<br>
from now, and hit him over a head; than you would be acting morally
<br>
(given ur prescience).  Lets say you are not prescient, and you hit
<br>
him over the head on the possibility that he might mug you; than you
<br>
are acting immorally.  Lets say you are not prescient, and he is mugging
<br>
someone else (as it is apparent to you from your vantage point), and you
<br>
intervene by hitting him over the head... Then you're actions may or may
<br>
not be immoral, on the basis that he may not be the one doing the
<br>
mugging,
<br>
but rather, may be the muggee.  The point being that you have to
<br>
consider
<br>
the granularity of the event, the knowledge you had as an autonomous
<br>
agent,
<br>
the environment you're in, and the action chosen, and the outcome of
<br>
that action... 
<br>
All those are invariably what people choose to judge you over [from a
<br>
historical
<br>
perspective].... and since I am not particularly concerned about
<br>
morality within
<br>
a persons own framework, but rather, a cooperative sort of morality that
<br>
effectively
<br>
incorporates even the most base of people intuitions, that is the scope
<br>
my statement
<br>
is meant to be evaluated in.  If you can find a *single* (reasonable,
<br>
defined as a person
<br>
who's views of reality are generally accurate) person (within your
<br>
collective)
<br>
who judges your actions immoral on the basis of your premptive action,
<br>
than you 
<br>
have violated the precepts of a good moral system.  Ergo don't go around
<br>
<p>bonking people on the head until you are sure of the situation you are
<br>
in, 
<br>
and then react only as needed.  Incidentally, this is the equivalent to
<br>
a 
<br>
code of laws system.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Indeed sometimes there would be
<br>
a moral impetus towards action (even pre-emptive 
<br>
action). We cannot *know* for certain the actions of
<br>
others and we cannot always prudently wait for them
<br>
to do their worst before we respond. In the end it is
<br>
to our own judgement of the total risks that we must
<br>
hold true and then on that judgement we must act 
<br>
(including in *some* cases pre-emptively). 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;I'll agree that you can *feel* you're actions are morally motivated.
<br>
I would say however, that if you were to examine you're actions
<br>
rationally,
<br>
you will always find a probability or pathway (excluding a continious
<br>
action like a knife stabbing towards you, ergo a certain level of
<br>
granularity)
<br>
that will lead to your &quot;preemptive action&quot; being immoral.  Of course you
<br>
could always say (arbitrarily) that I was reacting to the best of my
<br>
abilities
<br>
to the best of my knowledge ergo my action was moral by my system of 
<br>
morals/ethics.... But I tend to think of that as a cop-out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In relation to your secondary point (stated in this letter); I really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think morality has anything necessarily to do with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-delusion, or the acknowledgement thereof. Or rather, there is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth that states necessarily you have to be honest, ergo an act of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonesty (as it relates to self-delusion) does not violate any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly great truth.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; First the status of morality and the rationality of ethics is 
<br>
pretty widely regarded at least so far as I am aware in 
<br>
philosophical circles as being almost a matter of opinion.
<br>
(eg. Bertrand Russell. History of Western Philosophy).
<br>
<p><p>&lt;me&gt; I'm sure it is; until you run into an event that requires 
<br>
faith or belief outside of rationality.  Ergo if I'm marooned
<br>
on a desert island for 60 years, does it really make a damned
<br>
difference if I hallucinate marilyn monroe on the island with me
<br>
in order to remain sane?  I tend towards a function and 
<br>
dysfunctional definition of sanity; if its dysfunctional, then you
<br>
are not being ethical.  if its functional, you are being ethical.
<br>
and since functionality is related to the environment you are
<br>
operating in, ergo my comment about self-delusion not really
<br>
having anything to do with morality... I definately think everyone
<br>
is engaged in it to some degree (self-delusion), and to the extent
<br>
that it helps you, its ethical....
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I find this conclusion powerful, dangerous and deeply 
<br>
unsatisfying so I am keen to have at it. Let's be clear 
<br>
I may fail but if I'm going down like Don Quixote, 
<br>
then I'm going down &quot;having at&quot; one of the larger 
<br>
uglier philosophical  windmills. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I was just telling my little sister yesterday about one
<br>
of the classical issues in my life (at one point during
<br>
my younger years); at what point does being too intelligent
<br>
start to harm you (the classic form being, if you could trade
<br>
intelligence for gauranteed happiness, would you do it)...
<br>
most intelligent people say no; I think the really intelligent
<br>
people though, when they consider it, say yes.  This is of 
<br>
course, assumes that people intuitively seek to maximize their
<br>
utilities, and said maximazation of utility defines a state
<br>
of happiness [which is, I think, reasonable]... Ergo self-delusion
<br>
is only dangerous if you can't discard the delusion when
<br>
it becomes detrimental to your pursuit of happiness.  This
<br>
is the hallmark of a creative intellect, insofar as it requires
<br>
both the vision to see the possibilities, and the ability to maintain
<br>
seperate versions independant of each other {and process
<br>
them for fitness subconsciously}.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Ok. Now here's my point. Unless a moral code can
<br>
arise form a set of universals such as a propensity to
<br>
reason and a predispositon to sociability then there is
<br>
not likely to be much genuine agreement between 
<br>
subjective individuals on moral codes
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;Oh I'll *agree* that it is absolutely necessary
<br>
to have something to that effect; I think the inclusion of
<br>
a predisposition to sociability is where your moral system
<br>
will fail, as in a fair amount of people are not (at some point
<br>
in their lives) sociable.... Any moral system you build on that
<br>
premise is doomed to fail because it does not take into account
<br>
actions by that subpopulation of people (antisocial individuals
<br>
who are operating on a different ethical system).  I would
<br>
state that ur assumption that there is a propensity to
<br>
reason is a reasonable one in that it is necessary for
<br>
the ability to recognize other autonomous agents actions
<br>
for what they are; expressions of their own moral/ethical systems..
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Further those
<br>
who do not know endeavour to understand themselves,
<br>
what manner of creature they are, are not going to be
<br>
in a position to know what the most optimal compromises
<br>
for them are when compromises need to be made. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I've met several people who are extremely intuitively,
<br>
but unable to verbalize (form coherent sentences) expressing
<br>
their viewpoints...they just know what is right for them, and
<br>
what is not... how does your system encompass them?
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; A person
<br>
that deludes themselves that they are a different sort of 
<br>
creature with different sets of drivers and needs than 
<br>
they actually have is precluded from sitting down at table 
<br>
to negotiate for their own best interests because they do not 
<br>
know their own best interests. A person that deludes themselves 
<br>
willingly can hardly be a person that others would want to 
<br>
engage in a moral compacts with. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; according to you :) to me its fine :) In fact, i rather
<br>
like space cadets :)  They tend to have a rather fascinating
<br>
imagination, and are very suggestible...
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I should give you a friendly warning at this point;
<br>
I am generally where people's morals systems (day-2-day)
<br>
break; they invariable adopt (when dealing with me) mine
<br>
as it is impossible to force me to adopt theirs, and generally
<br>
speaking, I am a fairly productive person (and very difficult
<br>
to avoid if your moral system ends up conflicting with mine).
<br>
I say this of course, in a friendly manner, because it will
<br>
give you an insight to my fundamental objection to your
<br>
system....that it, it is not sufficiently broad enough to 
<br>
encompass all useful people (non-functional insanity excluded).
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Within the context of the time available I think 
<br>
individuals ought to use pan critical rationalism in 
<br>
their approach to understanding their own nature and 
<br>
then pursuing the optimal outcome for them in accordance 
<br>
with their nature. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;....which may end up not being rational (to outside
<br>
examination)....
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; This optimal outcome will necessarily 
<br>
involve compromise because others whose cooperation 
<br>
is needed will not if they are enlightened and empowered 
<br>
(and likely to be good allies as a consequence) strike 
<br>
bad bargains.  
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I would agree with this sentence :) compromise
<br>
is often called for amongst people if they hope to culture
<br>
friendships that will be substantial in trade.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or to put it more bluntly, sometimes self-delusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the ticket :) Ever wonder why (evolutionary-speaking)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have emotions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I reckon to the extent one is self deluded one will be 
<br>
screwed at the negotiating table because perceptive others 
<br>
will recognize you as having a lower sentience quotient and 
<br>
the only one to blame for this if you are self deluding will 
<br>
be yourself.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; depends on how intelligent they are.  some forms of 
<br>
self-delusion are bad, some are good.  some are bad generally,
<br>
but useful in achieving short-term goals...
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; fundamentally though, I think you're exclusion of
<br>
people who are self-deluded though, would end up eliminating
<br>
all of humanity... and ergo ur proposed moral system would
<br>
fail in that it would not encompass anyone... and if there
<br>
was a completely rational person (at some point), than they 
<br>
would probably end up suicidal..  Of course this is conjecture
<br>
on my part (assuming everyone is self-delusional to a degree)
<br>
but I think it is bourne out by the nature of being human.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now against this point it might be argued that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no circumstances where dishonesty with oneself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a moral matter. I conceed that this is the traditional view but my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contention is that that traditional view is wrong, flawed, and lacking
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; in utility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fair enough, I'll bite :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am arguing that only those that can commit themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hold themselves to a rational moral code are in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position to have the sort of maturity that is required to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forge the sort of compacts that will best serve the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongest forms of cooperatives and the most extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; substitute &quot;ethics&quot; in for &quot;morality&quot; and I'd agree;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; So far I've been using morality and ethics without
<br>
distinguishing them particularly. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; yeah I noticed :) I was trying to disinguish the two 
<br>
for the purposes of this dialogue :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; morality to be is something generally provided for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by external sources (rather than derived by said people);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it also deals heavily with intention.  Now, I *really* don't care what
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; people's intentions are, just their actions.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Of course you do. A person that you know was intending
<br>
to steal from you yesterday but did not for lack of an 
<br>
opportunity is likely to be filed as such and regarded as
<br>
such. If not you'd be suckered far more often than the 
<br>
norm.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; &quot;an honest man is just a thief without opportunity&quot; :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intention are more of a heuristic to decide whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not someone's future actions will be favorable.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; They certainly are that. And a persons future actions
<br>
, their motives, their reputation are surely part of practical 
<br>
moral deliberations on your part. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; nope.  I deal on a tit-for-tat basis.  Either people adhere
<br>
to a basic set of standards, or they disappear from any sort of
<br>
significant interactions (if I itch, I scratch).  There's generally
<br>
a ramp-up period of re-training.  They are free to interact with
<br>
others, however they wish. I do not interfere unless called upon
<br>
by another (involved) party.  I am *always* fair.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This discussion could all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be simplified by people adopting a non-intention based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, where people are judged by their actions, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements made by said people are evaluated in that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context (as actions).
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I am trying to establish the validity of the statement to 
<br>
thine ownself be true. You, I think, are trying to make me
<br>
make the case or to refute it.  I am not interested in a simple moral
<br>
system 
<br>
I am interested in a rational, teachable and extensible one. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; Its rational, teachable and extensible.  In fact, its more
<br>
teachable
<br>
than a complicated one....  There are no gray areas.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt;If I can teach a moral system that has high 
<br>
utility to those I teach it too, like teaching the principle of tit 
<br>
for tat, then I can be confident that the world will be that much more
<br>
pleasant and predictable for me as a result.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; evaluate my suggestion within the context of whether or not such 
<br>
a system would be fit ur standards and offer high utility... I would
<br>
suggest, humbly, that it does...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not imagine that any of us ultimately succeeds in avoiding self 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion. But if the charge of hyper-rationality is ever a valid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism I do not think it can be so on matters of morality where the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; individuals concerned acknowledge that their take on the universe is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently subjective and inherently selfish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there are degrees of self-delusion; I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important than self-delusion is the end effect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-delusion has on the person as a total system.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; In almost all negotiations, and most moral matters 
<br>
between persons involve a quid quo pro, the best possible 
<br>
outcome for the individuals involved depends on them 
<br>
recognizing the best possible outcome for them (without 
<br>
their being deluded as to what they want or need) and 
<br>
then most closely approximating it.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I think perhaps, we mean two things by being deluded..
<br>
You are referring to a final state of utility reached
<br>
by a rational deduction of what your particular utility table
<br>
is... I am referring to it as a person who has already determined
<br>
their utility table, but reached it through a non-rational pathway.
<br>
Ergo for you, someone who is self-deluding themselves is incapable
<br>
of understanding what their true utility tables are... whereas for me,
<br>
a person who is self-deluding themselves is a person who is mapping
<br>
their stimuli (internal &amp; external) to alter an unpleasant situation to
<br>
a state of utility...where said mapping may not be based either on
<br>
a rational inference chain (thinking), or even by rational examination
<br>
of ones self... What do you think? Can you clarify exactly what you
<br>
mean by self-delusion?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is my contention that if we cannot find a harmony of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfish interests we will not find anything but the illusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of harmony at all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; in other words, someplace where everyones needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are met...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Absolutely not. That is pure fantasy land. The best we can
<br>
hope to achieve is a reasonable compromise where all sit
<br>
down in good faith and recognizing that all are compromising 
<br>
but all are gaining in the aggregate all act in accordance with 
<br>
the agreement.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; in other words, someplace where everyones needs
<br>
are met...to the best of the collectives ability?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And in order for their to be a harmony of selfish interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their must be real recognition of the nature of oneself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ones needs. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a mapping of sensory input to available physical stimulus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats another possibility, sans recognition of one's own selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests.  
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I wouldn't limit one's self understanding and ones understanding
<br>
&nbsp;of ones needs and desires to the mere physical. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I certainly wouldn't extend it to the metaphysical :) Brain
<br>
processing
<br>
is a physical process.  Its influenced directly by physical processes..
<br>
Including meta-thoughts (working on ur concepts directly with a higher
<br>
level grammer).
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I think there are social needs in most people that are very deep
<br>
seeded 
<br>
and go beyond the need for physical contact.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I wasn't referring to that :) I was referring to altering the
<br>
reality you're
<br>
living in (cognitively) by biofeedback, but on an subconscious level.
<br>
Something
<br>
akin to the Siberian train conductors lowering their metabolism, based
<br>
on when
<br>
the train was going to pull into the station [arrive].. but more
<br>
sophisticated..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Same goes for empaths (people with highly developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities to sense what others are feeling off of physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [body, speech] cues).  They intuitively understand people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and respond sans a specific rational understanding of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  There's no reason (any empaths out there?) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that emotion-intuition is not being applied to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves (the equivalent of reflection).
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I am not sure what your point is here. Sociopaths are also
<br>
good readers of patterns. They just don't empathise. But
<br>
I would argue that sociopathy is dysfunction. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; Depends on whether or not sociopaths can manage to
<br>
contain their more destructive impulses (or rather, get away
<br>
with it).  There's a subpopulation of sociopaths who are 
<br>
quite successful, who manage to sustain their needs by
<br>
twisting the letter of the law to suit their need.  Its not
<br>
necessarily a dysfunction. + on top of it, it depends on whether
<br>
or not a sociopath is bothered by prison.  Who knows?
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; And real  sociopaths would possible grin at me 
<br>
and say who needs that sentimental bullshit anyway. 
<br>
And I'd say you do here's why ..etc.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I think I can say very fairly that sociopaths do not
<br>
think like normal people; especially (or rather, primarily)
<br>
when it comes to their utility tables...  There's no basis
<br>
for comparison :) Ergo why I brought them into the
<br>
conversation...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [Brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where I think it becomes important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to acknowledge to oneself that one can be rational and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one is by nature social. If one does not acknowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one is social one is not (by my reckoning) being true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to oneself and one does not have the sort of maturity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will enable one to be on good terms with oneself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to form real compacts that have a chance of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honored with others. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ooooh I don't know about that :)  You seem to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people are by nature, social creatures.  I don't necessarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think thats the case. Or to qualify, people are social by a matter of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Sure but there is a baseline. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; go tell that to the unibomber.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some are quite capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of going it alone while others would die if seperated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the herd.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Only after some initial basic social assistance has been
<br>
rendered.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; We're dealing with [dynamic] adults here, no? You don't intend
<br>
to limit your morality to only those who are currently social?
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Many infants get suboptimal social assistance and the 
<br>
outcomes are often dysfunctional people. But they are not 
<br>
dysfunctional  by choice. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; but they're still dysfunctional, at least, according to what
<br>
currently
<br>
passes for a majority of society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So i question ur assumption that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is social.... Its obviously a core belief in ur system, and certes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally speaking, it is the case that most people are social.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Belief has nothing to do with it. I have learned and observed
<br>
human infants I know that physiologically they cannot survive without 
<br>
assistance - that they wish to survive - that they suckle if they can 
<br>
and cry if they can't is not a matter of mere belief.  
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I'll agree with ur assessment on babies... now whats the relevance
<br>
to your moral system?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But not all.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Not all to the same degree. But there is no person alive at
<br>
present 
<br>
(to the best of my knowledge) with the power to stay alive without 
<br>
cooperating with others. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; but you acknowledge that it is a possibility?
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; It is not necessary that social be about niceness it is better,
<br>
more funcitonal, if it is about an enlightened understanding of frailty
<br>
and the benefits of cooperation. I would argue that tyrants that aim for
<br>
the short glorious life of Archilles in 2003 are short changing
<br>
themselves. They are sub-optimally selfish. With a tweak of their value
<br>
systems they may be able to satisfy more of their needs and desires by
<br>
cooperating. But many of them would have to re-learn and I'd expect few
<br>
of them to change what has worked for them if they could not be
<br>
presented with a compelling argument. If there is no compelling argument
<br>
that can be made to their self interest then I would say that no real
<br>
moral argument is being put to them at all.  
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; ....except to say that they have presumeably successfuly satisfied
<br>
their own utility tables....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there was a creature that by nature was not social in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any sense I would grant by my notion of morality that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that creature would have no duties to others and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that creature would not be acting immorally in anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it did to others.  If one is sure that one is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatened by a genuine sociopath by my moral reckoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one would not only be permitted to act in ones defence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one would be morally obliged. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see now I wouldn't go that far; just because ur being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatened by a sociopath does not necessarily mean they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will carry out that act;  there's a whole subset of sociopaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that lead &quot;normal&quot; lives without going through the murder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sprees that characterize their (by our definitions) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less-successful brethern.  I think thats more of a policy issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to be decided upon by each individual)....
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; That is exactly right. In the end the individual must decide 
<br>
moral policy for themselves. The intelligent individual will take into 
<br>
account existing social mores and laws but in the end they 
<br>
will not shirk the responsibility of the moral decision. They cannot. 
<br>
To shirk is the allow defaults to go into play.  
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; yes but ur system implies a judging of that moral code
<br>
(at the end of the day) by other members of that society...
<br>
so individual morality is irrelevant if the rest of the group
<br>
does not consent to that action as being moral...
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;my overall point is that saying you're action (by your own
<br>
moral standard) is moral is trivially easy to do; convincing
<br>
others is far more difficult.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In practise I would have some residual doubts about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the completeness of the sociopathy of even a creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as Hitler so I would not feel completely free to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exterminate him with extreme prejudice unless I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made a good faith reckoning as to the nature of him 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a threat to what I value. Then having made a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best a rational determination of the nature of the threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I could given the time and context I would feel free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exterminate him with exteme prejudice and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would expect to feel no guilt but only some misgivings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that had I more time I might have judged better. ie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My concept of morality is I think in that sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical. And it is extensible. If others share it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they act rationally and in accordance with their selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  best interests as they perceive it I can (in the context) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this moral system have not fault them morally.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now don't u see a contradiction therein? What if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sociopath, or even loony person (to broaden the set),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is merely acting to fulfill his own utility (ergo munching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on ur spleen or the like)?  I mean, just because someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else is &quot;selfishly&quot; (is their any other way?!) pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there own interests, doesn't necessarily mean ur own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral code should approve their own...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; No my moral code would tell me if this person is reasonable
<br>
I can point out that their aspiration to munch on my spleen
<br>
is well recognized by me and that that is not a circumstance
<br>
that I can permit to prevail. Either we reason out a conclusion 
<br>
together or we fight to the death now. I then invite them to 
<br>
do their calculations of cooperation vs competition and 
<br>
consider how the agreement if it is to be cooperation will 
<br>
be effectively honored. If at any stage I feel that my appeals 
<br>
to their reasoning is hopeless then I fall back on trying to kill 
<br>
them before they kill me. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; what, you offer them half ur spleen? you're moral code has
<br>
just failed to offer a suitable compromise to another rational
<br>
autonomous agent... whereas his morality disregards yours, yours
<br>
fails to achieve its basic premise... that of being attractive to 
<br>
others rational beings...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [Paul]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Pretty much the only time u can consider something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral or immoral is after the event has occurred, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then, only for urself.  Morality has absolutely no import in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pre-emptive doctrine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]I don't agree. By my reckoning of morality, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals agree to cooperate with each other for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutual advantage (perhaps at some cost to them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other dimensions were they reckoning their best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests separately) there is a moral bond between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; according to ur definition of morality :)
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Yes. According to a system I'm offering up 
<br>
for consideration because I think there is some consistency 
<br>
and utility in it and because if I am right and it is teachable 
<br>
I will benefit by shifting the cooperate compete decision 
<br>
more towards cooperation (just as if I had taught the principle 
<br>
of tit for tat). 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; .. but is it the optimal solution?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [Paul]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyone that believes to the contrary has not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationally examined the situation.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Depends what you mean by belief. Belief is a problem word
<br>
for me because a lot of people who are doing more than
<br>
mere believing use the word belief to indicate a sort of 
<br>
less than certain knowledge. The problem is that some people 
<br>
that use the word belief may have done no personal processing 
<br>
on the issue at hand at all but may have simply adopted 
<br>
wholesale something that they were indoctrinated with.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; the latter part of that paragraph is what I'm implying;
<br>
that any rational person who has (without resort to emotion,
<br>
or any rationalization or justification) examined the
<br>
concept of acting pre-emptively (sans sufficient proof or
<br>
knowledge of the current environment) is reasoning falsely.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; If you are implying that my proposed moral system is flawed
<br>
or inconsistent or unclear then, yes, I am willing to accept that that 
<br>
could be in fact a valid criticism but I'd ask you to point out where 
<br>
because as I've said trying to find means of increasing cooperation 
<br>
and putting morality and ethics on a more rational footing is a 
<br>
worthwhile task.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; three points really; 
<br>
a) it doesn't make a difference how you arrive at an API, it is only 
<br>
important to establish one (rational or otherwise).  There is no reason
<br>
that an emotional or intuitive based person cannot maximize their own
<br>
utility while being consistent from an external point of view of their
<br>
behaviors.
<br>
Ergo, consistency is key {even more so than cooperation, becaue if you
<br>
really want somebodies cooperation, you will invariably have that
<br>
already
<br>
incorporated in ur utility table [by virtue of it being a necessity to
<br>
fulfill
<br>
some other greater utility] and ergo you will have something to offer in
<br>
trade}.
<br>
<p>b) it should successfully deal with all types of people; that includes
<br>
people
<br>
who want to munch on ur spleen, and people who are complete
<br>
loners[antisocial],
<br>
and even those that aren't rational [non-functionally insane]
<br>
<p>c) the API should be predicteable...having a code of laws where no-one
<br>
can
<br>
predict whether or not they are in compliance is pointless.  It doesn't
<br>
make
<br>
a difference whether or not they agree with the fundamental reasonings,
<br>
they should be able to follow the statements out to their (hopefully
<br>
logical)
<br>
consequences or in barring that, have a simple intuitive model to guide
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; [brett]To be frank, I am doubtful that the word belief can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be validly coupled (except as crude linguistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shorthand for &quot;this is my operating hypothesis&quot;) with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rational examination of  any situation. Belief is often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used by fairly rational people in just this short hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; belief =&gt; a statement a rational agent holds true.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Many use it like this. I don't like it because I spend a lot
<br>
of time considering the politics of language and communication.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I don't; I use a word sans negative or positive connotations.
<br>
Descriptive, accurate and precise. The sentence is where I pass
<br>
judgement on the thought, not the word.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I think that if an extrope is debating with a flat earther in
<br>
&nbsp;front of an open minded audience and the audience is only partly 
<br>
paying attention and they hear the extrope talking of beliefs on the 
<br>
one hand and the flat earther talking of beliefs on the other the 
<br>
audience may be seduced into thinking one belief may be just as 
<br>
good as the other. I think it is in our interests to get some
<br>
probability 
<br>
and quantifiability into the discussion. Belief is language which 
<br>
serves the preservation of the status quo. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I agree; if you are ambigious on how I am using a word,
<br>
just ask for clarification.. vice versa on my end, assumed, of course.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [Brett] By the code of morality I have tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe, belief qua belief is immoral. This is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when one is believing one is not reasoning and when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is not reasoning to the route of ones selfish best interest one is
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; groping with a less than optimal method.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depends on how u define it :) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. And I don't think extropes generally define it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do, but my point is that people who hear belief being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used may be people we are trying to persuade and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behooves us to use the most persuasive language.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; disagree.  more important than persuading other
<br>
people is establishing a way of communicating clearly
<br>
and unambigiously, preferably with some training
<br>
into how to accurately convey your thought processes
<br>
to another, and how to detect (and request clarification)
<br>
when others are using a word to convey a different
<br>
semantic construct.  Ergo I never argue persuasively,
<br>
only defensively :)  Lawyers argue persuasively, and
<br>
just about everybody I know (excluding lawyers) hates
<br>
dealing with them [ergo a necessary evil]....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Belief is a poor word for conveying significant amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of intellectual exercise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And certes, just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you believe something doesn't necessarily make it false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or ill-advised); classic example, I believe the sun will rise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow morning...  Of course the veracity of that statement will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require observation tomorrow morning; but the belief is both advisable
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; and statistically speaking, fairly certain...  In other words, belief 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and logic are not necessarily at odds; it depends on how you define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; My point is that when you speak in a political forum you 
<br>
do your own thought process which is based on considerably 
<br>
more than mere indoctrination by another (I hope) a disservice 
<br>
when you use the word belief instead of another word. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I see; you're making a broader point than are discussion :)
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt;(This is because not everyone who hears you use the word 
<br>
belief knows that you will have done more processing. 
<br>
It seems to me that many extropes fail to realise that the audience, 
<br>
the rest of the world doesn't give away free credibility points 
<br>
for one wacky belief over another.  
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; for me, personally, in day-to-day interactions, people always
<br>
quickly realize that any thought I express has been well-thought out.
<br>
I have not, of course, attempted to communicate in a traditional public
<br>
forum {press, tv, etc} other than internet-based forums (list-servs and 
<br>
usenet).  Incidentally, mostly because I'm not really trying to persuade
<br>
<p>anybody of anything outside of my scope of interaction.  I'm primarily
<br>
interested in getting my viewpoints out, to confirm whether or not there
<br>
are any flaws in my thinking that I have missed, or to flesh out an idea
<br>
by gathering other people's inputs on the subject, generally through 
<br>
anecdotal experiences... The scientifically-based stuff I get through
<br>
journals and books.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]My contention is that as soon as one becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;believer&quot; one has ceased to hold to the principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of to thine own self be true - unless one is incapable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reasoning - (or one must reach a tentative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion based on the imperative to live and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act in real time). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; hahahaha :) re - ur last qualification :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well since we're all stuck in this current universe... :)
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Yes, but again I'd go back to pan critical rationalism.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Without ever getting absolute certainty there are techniques 
<br>
which we can learn which give us a much higher probability of 
<br>
getting a correct (a useful) answer.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; until you discover that extreme you didn't consider..
<br>
I'm an engineer (mentality-wise), so for the most part, I 
<br>
always have to  build/plan for the worst case scenario..
<br>
Theoretically, that means I have a smaller margin for error
<br>
before I'm willing to sweep it under the rug as not worth
<br>
planning for.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Generally speaking, I have no use for morality;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just ethics [standard api, consistently adhered to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logically derived, based on reality]....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]I'm reading api as 'application programming interface'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; yuppers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]&quot;Generally speaking&quot; I suspect you are unlikely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoy discussing morality and/or ethics much further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with me ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; it doesn't really bother me, if thats what u're asking :)
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I was asking. I don't enjoy boring people, I just risk it ;-)
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; thats fair :) generally the conversation ends up dying out when
<br>
nobody bothers responding :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I've pretty much made up my ethical system, at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of the larger ruleset (meta-rules)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the smaller &quot;behaviors&quot; are data-driven  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (tit-for-tat, etc) :)
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; As indeed in practice most of us have. If I am right and a 
<br>
better more universal ethical system can be derived I would expect 
<br>
that in most peoples cases there would be very little observable 
<br>
differences in how they'd behave. But then on the other hand 
<br>
when one starts to routinely reason as oppose to believing one is 
<br>
in a position to converse mind to mind with other reasoning beings.
<br>
Beliefs can very easily become entrenched positions. 
<br>
I think to reason when reason is  available is more social 
<br>
and because I think humans are social (their interests are best 
<br>
served by cooperation) to  reason is moral to believe is not.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I agree with everything but ur last statement :) as I said,
<br>
give me an simple, robust API anyday.  It doesn't matter to me
<br>
if there is a one-to-one mapping between it and some derived,
<br>
generic ethical system, or there is a many-to-one mapping.  I
<br>
generally prefer rationally based systems in that the API happens
<br>
to conform to reality [generally the other requirement, don't
<br>
want to end up getting killed or maimed for my API]...
<br>
<p>I dunno, overall, I have some fairly big problems with your API.
<br>
<p>I think more than anything else though, its that social requirment
<br>
thing... :)  Then again, I've been described by several people
<br>
in my life as a human computer...
<br>
<p>omard-out
