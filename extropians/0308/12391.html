</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Alienation doesn't necessarily follow from asceticism, 
<br>
which in turn doesn't necessarily equal 
<br>
self-mortification.
<br>
Ideas about uploading a human mind or radically modified 
<br>
human bodies express a hoped-for ideal, not a rejection of 
<br>
the actual. Perhaps few extropes or transhumanists strive 
<br>
for an idealized human body through diet or exercise, but 
<br>
that makes such people (like me) lazy and wishful at 
<br>
worst.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;primo body&quot; or uploading serving as 
<br>
allegories--well, of course they do. Any actual radical 
<br>
transformation lies pretty far in the future, and might 
<br>
have significant drawbacks not currently imagined or even 
<br>
imaginable.
<br>
<p>People do take small steps toward rebuilt bodies and 
<br>
uploading. It's a slippery slope from cosmetics and wigs, 
<br>
past eyeglasses and contact lenses to prosthetics and 
<br>
beyond--but it's a continuous curve. A similar progression 
<br>
exists from wristwatches, possibly the first physically 
<br>
intimate mental assistant since pocket-sized notebooks, to 
<br>
portable cameras and audio recorders, to cell phones, 
<br>
PDAs, and wearable computers. 
<br>
<p>If you need an example of a purely asethetic bodily 
<br>
improvement, and plastic surgery won't serve, here's one.
<br>
I'd like to have a better sense of hearing to improve my 
<br>
ability to appreciate music. I'd like to have absolute 
<br>
pitch. I'd like to have the ability to discriminate 
<br>
absolute loudness, instead of about seven relative levels. 
<br>
I can't imagine what current music would sound like if I 
<br>
could hear volume as finely as pitch, much less imagine 
<br>
music composed by people with that ability.
<br>
<p>Hope this helps--you might also look at Kurzweil's &quot;Human 
<br>
Body 2.0&quot;. Please let the list know if your discussions 
<br>
profit.
