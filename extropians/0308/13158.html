Actually, no. It isn't odd. Rather than simply complaining, maybe it would
<br>
be nice if other countries that receive help from us actually offered some
<br>
form of constructive criticism rather than just hating us.
<br>
<p>That being said, I do have to admit that our foreign policy leaves a lot to
<br>
be desired. The problem is with the people. We've been brught into a cycle
<br>
of dependency where the masses have realized that they can vote themselves
<br>
money from their own treasury. People are more interested in what the
<br>
politicians promise to &quot;give&quot; them rather than the soundness of their
<br>
decision making abilities. Most voters are completely ignorant of our
<br>
foreign policy and how it affects the rest of the world. The decision makers
<br>
simply do what they feel they need to do to get re-elected so ultimately
<br>
there are bad decisions made only to increase the pocketbooks of the voters
<br>
accompanied by &quot;feel good&quot; actions that show the voters that we &quot;care&quot;
<br>
<p>The only way I see to solve this is to have the majority of the people
<br>
properly educated. Unfortunately, most people seem to be satisifed with
<br>
their current (mis)understanding of the way the world works. They see no
<br>
benefit in increasing their mental abilities. And to make matters worse, the
<br>
less educated they are, the more likely they are to reproduce offspring and
<br>
raise them in the same way.
<br>
<p>Popular culture only helps to intensify this. We have created a society
<br>
where people are proud to be a redneck. A society where Jerry Springer could
<br>
become successful.
<br>
<p>Hopefully this is only a phase. I see that at some point, drastic changes
<br>
will have to be made in the way this country works. It will most likely hurt
<br>
many people. Maybe through that, the mentality of people in this country
<br>
will change much like the depression created a generation of people that
<br>
were extremely frugal with money. Maybe people will begiin to care about
<br>
their education and open their minds.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, I would like to do something about it. I have some vague
<br>
ideas on how to do a small part at least. What I want to do is start a small
<br>
afterschool class in Natural science. Something kids can do besides sports
<br>
that would challenge their minds and ideas. It would be set up similar to
<br>
the way youth soccer is set up, with no government funding or intervention.
<br>
I am a long way from doing this as I am just now getting an idea of how it
<br>
would even work, but this is how I plan to help.
<br>
<p>As Smoochie the Rhino said, &quot;I can't change the world, but I can make a dent
<br>
in it.&quot;
