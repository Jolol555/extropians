<p><em>&gt; About this time last year I was yacking on about wanting

<p>Really depends what you want to do. There is a shortage of 
<br>
bioinformatics skills around that is unlikely to go away soon. 
<br>
Most bioinformaticists are currently life science degree holders
<br>
that have taught themselves to be IT savvy. Its far less common
<br>
to go the other way, but obviously not impossible if one has the
<br>
interest.
<br>
<p>Distance education puts limits on the sort of labwork you could
<br>
do. 
<br>
<p>But really imo the biggest factor is not a particular course (if your
<br>
willing to pay and the one you nominated is full fees) there will
<br>
not be a shortage of opportunities for you to learn. Its a case
<br>
of tailoring what outcome you want.
<br>
<p>I know Alan Trouson (mentioned as involved in setting up the
<br>
course) and have contacts involved in post grad biotech course
<br>
setting up at Melbourne Uni and RMIT. I'm happy to give you
<br>
some pointers if you want offlist as the short answer to your 
<br>
question is &quot;it depends&quot;.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
