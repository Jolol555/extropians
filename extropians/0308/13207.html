<p>I have no doubt this, or some variation, would work. I've secretly
<br>
maintained grey water systems in two cities, using various plants for
<br>
purification (I've found that water hyacinths in combination with papyrus do
<br>
a good job, and the water hyacinths grow extremely rapidly and provide a
<br>
ready supply of mulch for the gardens). None of the neighbors has ever
<br>
suspected. There is not an unpleasant odor unless you pour something toxic
<br>
down the drain and kill off your aerobic bacteria. Even then, the system
<br>
recovers rapidly.
<br>
<p>However, I've found that a more efficient and aesthetically pleasing means
<br>
of treating the byproducts of human metabolism (that is to say, shit and
<br>
pee) is to use thermophilic composting. There is no more odor than with a
<br>
conventional toilet; you don't need expensive fancy contraptions; the heat
<br>
kills pathogens, even worm eggs; the process takes up very little space and
<br>
is over with quickly -- in warm weather you go from excrement and sawdust,
<br>
dead leaves, or other high-carbon waste material to beautiful soil in a
<br>
couple of weeks. I have never used this process in town, but I used it the
<br>
whole time I lived on the farm. My cost to install the system was $15 for
<br>
the wood, lath and cement to make a base for the seat, $3.98 for two plastic
<br>
buckets, and a few bucks for cinder blocks to enclose the compost pile.
