</em><br>
<p>You presented an article on North Korea and concluded on the basis of
<br>
apparent cultural differences that it would be best to destroy them.
<br>
<p>Your exact question was,
<br>
<p>&quot;How do extropians/transhumanists deal with very strong cultures with very
<br>
non-western priorities?&quot;
<br>
<p>Your solution was *destroying the culture in question*.  That is genocide.
<br>
<p>You keep making recourse to triage.  So let's ask the unfortunate question,
<br>
&quot;How does genocide differ from triage?&quot;  The argument I put forward in a
<br>
previous post, which you may not have seen, is simply that triage is
<br>
strongly situated, whereas your proposal (genocide) is not.  For example, on
<br>
the battle field a doctor may have to choose who to treat first, this
<br>
requires a decision on the basis of the *relative* value of two or more
<br>
human lives.  In the example you give of a NEO striking Earth, decisions
<br>
have to made based on *relative* valuations of the lives of thousands.  In
<br>
your proposal, however, the situation isn't so clear.  What is the situation
<br>
(or, more specifically, the threat) and how to do we establish relative
<br>
value between one human life and another?  You introduce this rather awkward
<br>
idea of &quot;potential life&quot; to establish the threat: the threat is against the
<br>
creation of more life.  An immediate problem is how open ended this is:
<br>
Isn't it always the case that &quot;potential (more) life&quot; is under threat?
<br>
Isn't this situation too vague, too general?  Wouldn't we be doing this
<br>
&quot;triage&quot; all the time?  At the very least, the situation is not clearly
<br>
delineated.  Secondly, how do we establish relative value between one life
<br>
and another?  This is where I think the real problem lies.  You're not
<br>
establishing value between one life and another, you're establishing it
<br>
between life and *more* life.  To me, this just seems like an awkward way of
<br>
asking, &quot;What is the *absolute* value of human life?&quot;  And this is where you
<br>
step outside triage, because there is no situation, there is no relative
<br>
valuation of human life, there's just this un-situated, absolute value.
<br>
<p>So, if we've established that this is *not* triage, there's still the open
<br>
question of what, precisely, is wrong with ascribing an absolute value to
<br>
life.  I agree with you on two points: (1) the question you're asking *is*
<br>
&quot;extropic,&quot; inasmuch as extropy seems to embrace an idea of life
<br>
(complexity, extropy) as an absolute Good and strives for its increase and
<br>
proliferation; and (2) simply invoking a base morality in response to the
<br>
question doesn't quite cut it.  My own position on this is simply that the
<br>
extropian affirmation of life/complexity/extropy is incoherent.  Complexity,
<br>
I would argue, is the very definition of something that is purely relative,
<br>
complexity is observed by complexity, observable complexity is probably
<br>
directly correlated to the complexity of the observer.  And all this needs
<br>
to carry the disclaimer that I don't propose to know precisely what I mean
<br>
by &quot;complexity&quot; but have a general idea (I mean, of course,
<br>
life/complexity/extropy, that object of our affirmation, rather than, say,
<br>
algorithmic complexity, which might have something to do with it but is
<br>
clearly not the whole picture).  Your mileage may vary.
<br>
