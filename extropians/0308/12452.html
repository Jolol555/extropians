Damien writes (with satire turned-up to an unknown degree)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if they don't exist, they make very pretty pictures in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sky. Get a load of the gorgeous thing in NGC4261 at...
</em><br>
<p>I maintain only that the event horizons of this object and
<br>
other black holes have not *yet* formed, and there are as
<br>
yet *no* singularities over which to worry.
<br>
<p>It's just a frozen star, as all the Russian scientists in
<br>
the 1950's would have told you.
<br>
<p>But then along came Wheeler, and absolutely everyone who
<br>
reads Wheeler falls in love with his style, his ingeniousness,
<br>
and his imagination.  The following is written in attempted
<br>
emulation of his unforgettable style:
<br>
<p>1. Focus not on the Schwarzchild coordinates which 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produce apparent singularities at r = 2M (the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radius at which exists the event horizon), where
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t goes to infinity.
<br>
<p>2. Instead, focus on the real physics of the falling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astronaut by whose own clock time does not slow
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at all.
<br>
<p>3. By mathematically transforming coordinates---which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one knows has no effect on true singularities but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which can remove apparent ones caused not by nature
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but by poor choice of coordinate systems---conclude
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the falling astronaut's physics remain just as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do ours as he crosses the event horizon at a finite
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time by the reading of his watch.
<br>
<p>4. Conclude that the apparent difficulty in the S
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coordinates represents nothing physical at R = 2M
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that there exists a true singularity at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R = 0, which characteristically CANNOT be removed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by mathematical transformations, it being intrinsic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to reality itself.
<br>
<p>And speaking like this, though with vastly more eloquence,
<br>
with vastly more authority, and bolstered by extremely
<br>
imaginative and profound mathematical analysis, Wheeler
<br>
evidently brainwashed an entire generation of physicists,
<br>
apparently even including the Russians.
<br>
<p>A physicist---I claim---will admit to you that there is
<br>
no latest time at which a photon from the astronaut could
<br>
be received by us, and that photon trajectories into and out
<br>
of black holes are symmetric.  And yet that same physicist,
<br>
still under the thrall of Wheeler, will maintain that
<br>
event horizons &quot;exist&quot; and at the center of the black holes
<br>
singularities &quot;exist&quot; (they deliberately choose the present
<br>
tense).
<br>
<p>Moreover, if Hawking radiation from a black hole exists,
<br>
and that they eventually evaporate, then a quantum of
<br>
radiation will be the last emitted from the black hole
<br>
at some unimaginable but finite period of time in the
<br>
future (say after 10^200 years).  But this time is less
<br>
than the time that an idealized photon from an infalling
<br>
astronaut could be received on the outside, and so there
<br>
is a direct contradiction between the infinite time that
<br>
it would take an infalling astronaut to reach the event
<br>
horizon (in outside coordinates), and the finite time
<br>
(in outside coordinates) that the black hole emits its
<br>
last dying photon.
<br>
<p>Surely there're have been other people who see through all
<br>
this besides just me.
<br>
<p>Lee
