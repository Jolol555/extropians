Wei Dei commented on my comments re: Marvin Minsky's comments to
<br>
Dyson.
<br>
<p>He cited:
<br>
<em>&gt; See: <a href="http://www.weidai.com/black-holes.txt">http://www.weidai.com/black-holes.txt</a>.
</em><br>
<p>I apologize -- I do not recall seeing this earlier or the post you cite:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/archive/0205/106121.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/archive/0205/106121.html</a>
<br>
(which raises a number of issues, some of which I'm going to have
<br>
to reflect upon).
<br>
<p>*But*, just dealing with the physics aspect of a Dyson Shell/MBrain
<br>
constructed around a black hole -- it is very interesting.  It
<br>
is not to far from the &quot;externally powerer MBrain&quot; concepts that
<br>
I had in mind in the original MBrain paper but solves the cooling
<br>
problem in a very very interesting way.
<br>
<p>It is going to create a very interesting tradeoff -- if you want
<br>
the greatest computing capacity one is going to want a black hole
<br>
with a small mass (smaller event horizon).  This is going to increase
<br>
the production of Hawking radiation and will decrease the lifetime
<br>
of the black hole.  So you may be able to compute &quot;more&quot; but you
<br>
will do so for a shorter period of time before your means to do so
<br>
fails you.  (This may be related to computational civilizations
<br>
hurling themselves into black holes (or engaging in otherwise
<br>
self-destructive &quot;terminal&quot; activities) that I believe that Anders
<br>
and I have discussed, perhaps onlist, in the quest of &quot;ultimate&quot;
<br>
computations.)
<br>
<p>But the concept of MBrains with the stars (or fusion reactors)
<br>
on the outside and a black hole on the inside and the radiators
<br>
facing inwards instead of outwards certainly deserves a greater
<br>
amount of study.  Respectful nods on my part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You mention the fact that the Europeans and the Japanese are having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falling fertility rates. Why is this happening?  Is it an accident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unique to the human species that richer societies do less reproduction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or can we expect the same of other intelligent beings?
</em><br>
<p>To be honest I do not know.  In part I think it may be a decline on
<br>
the part of non-agricultural parents to need more children (to bring
<br>
in the harvest, etc.).  In part I think it may be because parents
<br>
(once they have control over reproductive processes) may choose to
<br>
focus limited resources on fewer children.  It may be a shift from
<br>
&quot;I want 'more' children&quot; to &quot;I want 'better' children&quot;.  But those
<br>
would only be guesses on my part.  Though if the last hypothesis is
<br>
correct the development of inexpensive genetic testing and greater
<br>
knowledge of how genes influence capabilities would suggest that the
<br>
trends will continue.
