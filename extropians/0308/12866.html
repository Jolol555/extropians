<p>You can already see this happening.  The increase in SPAM seems
<br>
to have annoyed someone high up in the Russian government
<br>
(Minister of Communications or something like that) who then
<br>
directed some programmers to develop software to take revenge
<br>
on the people sending SPAM (I don't know whether it acted
<br>
through a Denial of Service attack or an automated calling
<br>
of phone number attack, but both are clearly feasible).
<br>
[This was discussed on /. a few weeks ago.]  One does not
<br>
want to SPAM a &quot;Minister of Communications&quot; because one
<br>
can be pretty confident that they have access to a bigger
<br>
pipe to the internet than you do.
<br>
<p>There has also been discussion on /. in one of the articles
<br>
related to SPAM about developing standard filters that
<br>
effectively extract the response addresses/phone numbers
<br>
that SPAM typically require and having them generate
<br>
something like one automated response per second.  E.g.,
<br>
sending email to 25 million people results in 25 million requests
<br>
per second to some machine, or telephone effectively shutting it down.
<br>
(Interesting to note though that this might produce enough demand
<br>
on routers and switches to cause a telecomm industry recovery...).
<br>
<p>So we already have examples of individuals getting *really*
<br>
annoyed and doing something about it.  It is probably not
<br>
going to be a good thing if individuals get *really* annoyed
<br>
and have an AI at their disposal to do something about it.
