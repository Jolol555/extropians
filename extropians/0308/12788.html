<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Historically, there indeed has often been an oversupply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of labor and an undersupply of entrepreneurs---and whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fault is that?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Olga writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A fault is a fault is a fault? and a fault by any other name smells just
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foul:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/030809/bizeconomy_stress_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/030809/bizeconomy_stress_1.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As compared to what?  As compared to when?  The 20th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't any picnic, nor was the 19th.
</em><br>
<p>That was exactly my point in my previous post to your example
<br>
(unfortunately, your example was &quot;[Like in] 1830...&quot;).  I wasn't comparing
<br>
today's working conditions to past centuries' working conditions (surely, no
<br>
contest there).   We've got it much better now - and those reforms were not
<br>
won easily and were certainly not initiated out of the goodness of the
<br>
mucky-mucks' hearts.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Increasing&quot;.  Sure, maybe over the last three years as many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people learned the truth about how much money they were making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how &quot;great&quot; everything was in the bubble.
</em><br>
<p>Learned the truth ...? (I'm not sure what you mean, and maybe this point is
<br>
not worth pursuing, in any case.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fault I spoke of above can be evenly divided between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two groups.  The first is &quot;workers&quot; who have natural human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resentment of achievement and who in addition have fallen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for propaganda directed at management and entrepreneurs.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes a natural human resentment of achievement is a good thing.
<br>
Depends on what you mean by &quot;achievement.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The second is all the Marxists and left-leaning elements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of society that teach that being a business person or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entrepreneur is giving in to &quot;them&quot; and trying to be like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;them&quot;.  Subtly or not so subtly, many working class people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow up practically thinking themselves to be a kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traitor should they think of starting their own business.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm ... I suppose I'm a left-leaning &quot;element&quot; more than a right-leaning
<br>
element, but, so help me - not only have I never taught anyone that being a
<br>
business person or entrepreneur is giving in to &quot;them&quot; (?), but I've
<br>
actually *been* a business person and entrepreneur (and so have a lot of my
<br>
left-leaning ilky-inky-dinky-doo buddies).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead of starting businesses, the goal of both these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups the last 150 years has been to &quot;organize&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to deprive entrepreneurs of their property:  most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crucially, why don't &quot;workers&quot; who are often in oversupply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historically, go start their own businesses?
</em><br>
<p>Last 150 years, huh?  Hello, Earth to Lee. Granted, some women and former
<br>
slaves - who had hitherto not been able to own property (because they, sad
<br>
to say, *were* themselves designated as &quot;property&quot;) - not only tried, but
<br>
succeeded in finally being able just to *own* property.  Whether some
<br>
entrepreneurs were deprived of their property as a result depended, I
<br>
suppose, on various sorts of things like whether particular entrepreneurs
<br>
(1) owned slaves or (2) were married to women, who (at long last) were able
<br>
to inherit the property from their husbands.  Some women and former slaves
<br>
did start businesses, and a few even succeeded.  But, if you use your
<br>
imagination, you can probably come up with a few scenarios of how difficult
<br>
it must have been.  While reforms at the workplace progressed slowly through
<br>
the 1800s and early 1900s, they really took off starting with the civil
<br>
rights years of the late 1950s and through the 1960s (and the civil rights
<br>
struggle gave impetus to many other &quot;rights&quot; that were eventually
<br>
implemented into the workplace as we know it now).
<br>
<p>Mostly due
<br>
<em>&gt; to the aforesaid propaganda: it serves leftist politicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and theoreticians to keep such ideas out of the heads of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the masses&quot; so as to increase their own relative importance.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'm not certain what you mean about the propaganda, leftist
<br>
politicians and theoreticians and &quot;the masses&quot; of which you speak.
<br>
&quot;Increase their own relative importance.&quot;[?]  ... I have lost my way, baa
<br>
baa baa.
