</em><br>
<p>LOL!  Never let it be said that you are not highly appreciated
<br>
here for things like this :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is actually a logically possible interpretation of what you said, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e., it is okay to calmly and politely call for a fellow list member's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assassination and then debate the idea, but not to insult someone or call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them names.  Would you agree with this?
</em><br>
<p>I actually would *much* rather discuss any logical and
<br>
rational analysis of the reasons that Robert Bradbury
<br>
should be assassinated than read zero-content whining
<br>
and berating from some overly sensitive type who 
<br>
prefers to emote than explain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Lest anyone mistake me, I am emphatically not calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the assassination of Robert Bradbury or anyone else.)
</em><br>
<p>Too late.  You know how &quot;dangerous&quot; this list is.  He's
<br>
probably already as good as dead, because after all, there
<br>
exists *google*!  And millions of people will have mis-
<br>
understood!  His goose is cooked.  Thanks to you.
<br>
<p>But (as if it will do any good now), I also not only do
<br>
not wish a hair on Robert's head to come to an unseemly
<br>
harm, but don't even believe that there *exist* logical
<br>
or rational reasons to assassinate him.
<br>
<p>(And that definitely includes character assassination.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that you're calling for total openness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and yet simultaneously placing a restriction on speech.
</em><br>
<p>No, there are two (2) huge differences.  For one thing,
<br>
I am definitely *not* calling for an *enforced* restriction
<br>
of any kind.  Two, what I am urging that people do is to
<br>
desist from giving vent to their feelings on this list
<br>
---especially unsupported by argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I would hope that someday, people will be free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say anything they damn well please, 
</em><br>
<p>hear, hear!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and people will also be free to be offended and say so in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no uncertain terms, and, yes, besmirch the character of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person they dislike.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, crap.  I will still think very poorly of, and denigrate
<br>
so long as I breathe, many kinds of inappropriate, insulting,
<br>
visceral, and disgusting speech.  Just because people ought 
<br>
to be free to say what they want, I'm sure that you will 
<br>
agree that they ought to aspire to the highest standards which
<br>
we can conceive of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you enjoy, on mailing lists, that form of local politeness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which calls for not posting offended reactions, why is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular custom okay, but not that alternate form of politeness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which calls for not advocating genocide?
</em><br>
<p>The answer is that it's not a form of *impoliteness* to
<br>
advocate anything.  One must not confuse the medium with
<br>
the message, the manner in which something is said with
<br>
the content.  Railing at people has close to zero content,
<br>
except to communicate the emotional state of the speaker.
<br>
Ultimately, that is merely boring and crude.  On the other
<br>
hand, any *proposal*, no matter how outrageous, if it is
<br>
supported by rational argument deserves as much attention
<br>
as people have time for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are they not both restrictions on speech?  On SL4 I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hesitate to impose both restrictions, in the name of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving the glorious Signal and triumphing over Noise.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, while on the one hand you say---and I agree---that 
<br>
you hope &quot;people will be free to say anything they damn
<br>
well please&quot;, yet you enjoin people from doing so on
<br>
your list.  But I *do* totally understand and concur:
<br>
different lists have different purposes, and I'm sure 
<br>
that you'd argue that there is no contradiction in what
<br>
you are saying.
<br>
<p>But we both, evidently, are urging others to adopt
<br>
standards of &quot;good taste&quot;, and I think that analyses
<br>
of proposed assassinations and genocide can be in
<br>
good taste so long as they are carefully argued,
<br>
and, IMO so long as they provide a little obeisance
<br>
to traditional wisdom and people's sensitivities in
<br>
some way or another.
