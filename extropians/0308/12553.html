</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So you are not an example of what Paul was talking about,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;hyperlexia&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm hyperlexic, but I found discrete mathematics to be quite a pain to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pickup; mind you I excelled at geometric proofs.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;lee&gt; Getting good at geometry proofs doesn't fit with the rest of your
<br>
narrative.  
<br>
<p>I didn't say getting good; I said excelled :) anyways, I mentioned
<br>
geometric proofs
<br>
in that the need was apparent, and ergo the steps to take were apparent.
<br>
<p>&lt;lee&gt; How old were you when you  got good, or were able to get good, at
<br>
geometry proofs?
<br>
<p>I think I was in 8th grade or so :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyways, long story short, it turned out that discrete mathematics (as
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; its taught generally) was too abstract for me (ergo too many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directions to go in for a &quot;short&quot; proof sans need)
</em><br>
<p>&lt;lee&gt; Well, according to <a href="http://www.hyperlexia.org/">http://www.hyperlexia.org/</a> my guess
<br>
is that you are/were only very mildly hyperlexic.  Did
<br>
you show many of the symptoms listed there?
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; Yes, actually; all of them. I was reading college level (my
<br>
brothers book collection)
<br>
material when I was in 6th grade... generally to the exclusion of
<br>
interaction with
<br>
my class mates..  &lt;hence, antisocial&gt;..  the trend has not really
<br>
slackened in the
<br>
intervening years... The only thing that I don't really match (at least
<br>
now)
<br>
is &quot;specific, unusual fears&quot;...  I don't really remember being
<br>
frightened when
<br>
I was a kid, with the exception of a single nightmare I had when I was a
<br>
child.
<br>
Of course that could be do to poor recall, but i doubt it..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was very clear to both me and my professor though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I didn't &quot;learn&quot; discrete math the same way other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people did... It took a fundamentally different approach...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;lee&gt; It's as though you had to hack up in software a number line
<br>
or something that others had built into their hardware.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; the equivalent thereof.  I have an internal mental framework;
<br>
my conceptual memory is excellent.  I can deduce missing pieces
<br>
of information by their &quot;neighbors&quot;.  Its pretty amusing really, 
<br>
since I have terrible recall when it comes to day-to-day events;
<br>
I'm pretty much the only one i know who signficantly extends 
<br>
their memory by using keys... I lost a box of stuff once [materials], 
<br>
and  &quot;rediscovered&quot; a chunk of memory that was keyed off Shel 
<br>
Silverstein... but I would never have been able to recall it had I not
<br>
(accidently) read Shel Silverstein again...  Pretty funky.  In any
<br>
event,
<br>
it is clear to me that I don't really think like normal people (for
<br>
better
<br>
or worse)..
<br>
<p>&lt;lee&gt; There is a certain form of verbal reasoning that I'm no
<br>
good at, and have always felt that I had to &quot;hack up&quot; a 
<br>
substitute for what came naturally to others.  Or maybe 
<br>
I just don't trust my native reasoning ability in addition.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; could be :) I don't see anything to stop that kind of 
<br>
meta-grammer from forming... Its a useful ability.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Another really interesting portion is that the symbolic processing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into my kinesthetic system (its got a different name now, but I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember it off the top of my head).
</em><br>
<p>&lt;lee&gt; Proprioception?
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; yuppers thats the one :) thanks :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have extremely good sense recall when it comes to my skeletal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muscular system, including the direction of said muscles when it comes
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; to acquiring new skills.  I have the equivalent of a shorthand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grammar; I tell my muscles what I want them to do and they do it.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;lee&gt; Again, it makes me think you have no number &quot;feel&quot; at
<br>
all, because otherwise the feature you are mentioning
<br>
would map right onto it, and you'd be very good with
<br>
numbers.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; It isn't a lack of number feel (quite the opposite, I have an
<br>
excellent
<br>
affinity to numbers and their manipulations)... It was that discrete
<br>
mathematics
<br>
is a weaker form of algebra; there were simply too many different ways
<br>
to
<br>
accomplish the proof that the first step didn't present itself..  I work
<br>
off a 
<br>
need-based algorithm; without a need, I couldn't really choose one way
<br>
or
<br>
another.  As soon as I saw how discrete math was intended to be used, I 
<br>
understood what was required of me in regards to proving them.. It was
<br>
like
<br>
in my world(tm), theory of computation came first, then discrete
<br>
mathematics..
<br>
Trying to teach it to me in the traditional manner was pointless; it was
<br>
like
<br>
trying to ice skate uphill.  Mind you, I *understood* the proofs (which
<br>
baffled
<br>
my professor); I just couldn't generate the next step.. As soon as I had
<br>
a 
<br>
need-based framework constructed, discrete math fell into place in one
<br>
evening.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; The reason why I mentioned it was to draw a distinction; I have
<br>
always done
<br>
well in math prior to (and after) discrete math.  It was the *way* it
<br>
was taught 
<br>
that was counter-intuitive to me...  it wasn't poor symbol manipulation
<br>
techniques;
<br>
it was that there was too many different ways to go and no intrinsic
<br>
heurestic 
<br>
for selection of any particular pathway.  
<br>
<p>omard-out
