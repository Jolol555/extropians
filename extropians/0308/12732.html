<p><em>&gt; Rafal:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;### This is an old defense - &quot;I really like my butler, he's black, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good man, nevertheless. But you couldn't let blacks work on their own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listen to those scumbag abolitionists and set their own prices. They need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supervision, visas, regulations so they won't compete with me, so I can keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my cushy job. Except for my butler, let them clean sewers&quot;.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This doesn't seem to be my defense. Mine is that the greediest (not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarilly the very richest) segment of the economy are sending jobs 
</em><br>
overseas. This 
<br>
<em>&gt; will shrink the US middle class, and destablize the American economy. There 
</em><br>
are 
<br>
<em>&gt; those who, seemingly, are unconcerned or even jubilant about this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development. I am not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, this has certainly been a very interesting thread. I am sure that this 
<br>
job market has mutated the politics of many an American. So far it has not 
<br>
touched me: I am still employed, and I and my (immigrant Asian) wife are 
<br>
doing fine. However, many others are not doing so well.
<br>
<p>I hope that others are coming around to seeing our nation as a jointly owned 
<br>
property around an unwritten contract exists. The parties to this contract 
<br>
are the citizens of this nation.  Non citizens are NOT parties to this 
<br>
particular contract.  In part, the contract holds that the citizens must 
<br>
compete with each other for whatever benefits are to be had from 
<br>
citizenship.  Non citizens may not compete for the benefits of citizenship, 
<br>
unless they &quot;buy in&quot; in a sufficient amount.
<br>
<p>If our hired men (our politicians) subvert this contract, or allow others to 
<br>
subvert it, thereby defrauding/robbing/embezzling the citizens, they should 
<br>
face stiff penalties.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><em>&gt; Rafal:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;More quotes from a protectionist:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;And those bosses, they are worthless scum, every single one of them. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, you can't become a manager unless you are a stupid, incompetent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suck-up.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;And I didn't want to buy this imported car, really, but it was so cheap I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't resist. Tell those loser GM bosses to get their act together, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else I won't buy any of their cars. I have choice, you know.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;And tell them suck-up bosses who don't want to hire me, better think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over, or else I'll come over with some buddies, and you won't have no choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nomore.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yep.&quot;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the Fortune 500 send their buddies, lobbyists to DC to get their way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this economy. Now its back-firing and according to an article in the 
</em><br>
Wall 
<br>
<em>&gt; Street Journal, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this will cost W the election.
