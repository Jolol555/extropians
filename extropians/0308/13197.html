<p>Spike, I agree with you in theory. After all, I raised my daughter on
<br>
approximately $6000 per year. BUT! I started out already owning a tract of
<br>
land (in a remote location where no building codes were enforced), a pickup
<br>
truck, and some power tools. And I was able to earn my pittance at the rate
<br>
of $85 - $175 per hour (depending on the sort of work I was doing). So I had
<br>
plenty of time left over to scrounge free building materials, plan and
<br>
construct buildings, plan and install gardens, and so forth.
<br>
<p>I challenge you, Spike -- I'm not kidding, this is an honest-to-dog
<br>
challenge -- next time you can take six months off from work, go out and try
<br>
living at the lower end of the economic scale. Here are the rules:
<br>
<p>1. You cannot rely on your higher education or professional experience.
<br>
2. You have to leave your vehicle(s), credit cards, nice clothing, etc. at
<br>
home.
<br>
3. You cannot take money from your bank account via ATM, online or through
<br>
any other means. The only way you're allowed to get money is to earn it or
<br>
obtain it through begging. (by the way, I've been told by people who know
<br>
from first-hand experience that for the short term, you can do better by
<br>
begging than by getting a minimum wage job -- if you can position yourself
<br>
at a good intersection that isn't already controlled by others; you'll
<br>
probably find that the best locations are already staked out, and if you try
<br>
to set yourself up there, you'll be run off by the existing &quot;owners&quot;; but
<br>
you might be able to cut a deal with them where you'll pay them a certain
<br>
amount of rent each day for the privilege of using their intersection.)
<br>
4. You have to live like this for a minimum of six months.
<br>
<p>Since almost everyone has a little money and a few possessions, you can take
<br>
the following with you when you leave home:
<br>
<p>-- $1000 in cash (this is an *extremely* generous start-up allowance,
<br>
roughly equivalent to a month's take home pay for a minimum wage earner).
<br>
I'm setting it this high so you can make some purchases to get yourself even
<br>
with where a mimum wage earner might be at any given time (e.g. you could
<br>
purchase cookware, dishes, a few changes of clothing, toothbrush, safety
<br>
razors, materials to make a sign for begging (you can find cardboard or
<br>
pieces of plywood lying around, but you'll probably have to buy markers or
<br>
paint); if you choose to try to grow some food you could buy a few gardening
<br>
tools. But it takes approximately two years to get a &quot;raw&quot; piece of land
<br>
into condition to give you a high yield per square foot, and you'll have to
<br>
figure out some way to get compostable material to your garden plot (if you
<br>
can somehow find a garden plot -- most land owners won't let you use their
<br>
land, even if it's just sitting there vacant, because they want to be able
<br>
to maintain it by running a mower over it). A couple hundred bucks will go a
<br>
long way at garage sales or thrift shops; the problem will likely be getting
<br>
yourself to the garage sales and shops and getting the stuff to its ultimate
<br>
destination without a vehicle; you'll have to consider your purchases
<br>
carefully, as you will have spent most of your starting allowance on
<br>
housing -- unless of course you choose to live on the streets; and you'll
<br>
want to keep something for food, at least enough to live on until you can
<br>
get familiar with the best dumpsters -- but again, these will probably
<br>
already be claimed (you have to hit them at the right time of day, else all
<br>
you'll find is inedible garbage), and you'll have to come up with some sort
<br>
of strategy to get a share).
<br>
<p>-- You glasses, if you need them (if you wear contacts, I would suggest
<br>
leaving these at home, since keeping them clean can be a problem if you're
<br>
living on the streets) and any medications you need (a *real* minimum wage
<br>
earner would probably not have the medication and might therefore be in
<br>
poorer health than you will be)
<br>
<p>If you think the above rules are grossly unfair, feel free to suggest
<br>
changes, but the point is to start out with nothing more than the average
<br>
minimum wage earner would have at any one time.
<br>
<p>I know it could be done, and you're probably smart enough to do just fine;
<br>
but I suspect you'd find it a lot more difficult than you anticipated.
<br>
<p>I like to go for long walks, and I sometimes find myself hungry and thirsty
<br>
and rather far from home, with no money or credit cards. Although in the
<br>
city one can usually find an outdoor faucet from which one can drink, and
<br>
there are almost always edible plants growing wild in vacant lots and even
<br>
in cracks in the pavement, it's awfully hard to find anything with
<br>
substantial calories free for the taking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We expect more now, so it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come as no surprise that it costs more.
</em><br>
<p>This is not entirely accurate, Spike. There are plenty of people (I speak
<br>
from first hand knowledge here, having interacted with such people and
<br>
having *been* one from time to time) who would be happy to live in the
<br>
simplest of dwellings. But city codes won't allow it. For example, to take
<br>
the electrical code alone -- these days in Luling, Texas, a small laid back
<br>
place where the codes tend to be less stringent than in the Big City, you
<br>
have to have (among many, many other things) a separate A/C circuit
<br>
dedicated to the smoke alarm system; arc fault circuit interrupters in every
<br>
bedroom; ground fault circuit interrupters every place there is a countertop
<br>
(regardless of whether said countertop is located in a &quot;wet&quot; area); and you
<br>
are required to install an electrical outlet at least every x feet (can't
<br>
recall exact figure, but it's pretty low; in other words, you're required to
<br>
put in lots of electrical outlets) throughout the dwelling, except in
<br>
storage areas). These items alone, if installed by a licensed electrician,
<br>
would cost more than the typical minimum wage earner would have to spend on
<br>
a house. Some counties have less expensive standards outside city limits,
<br>
but the typical minimum wage earner does not have access to a reliable
<br>
vehicle on a regular basis; and there aren't many jobs to be had in rural
<br>
areas, nor is it easy to get regular work as an independent contractor. So
<br>
they're pretty much stuck with living in town. For those a bit higher up the
<br>
economic ladder, there are mobile and manufactured homes. In central Texas
<br>
(where the cost of living and wages are somewhat below the national average)
<br>
the typical new mobile or manufactured home will cost more than $50,000 at
<br>
the *low* end for a 2-bedroom model (and of course, that cost does not
<br>
include the land and utility hookups). You can buy a really raunchy used
<br>
mobile home for under $3000, but you still have to buy land and pay for
<br>
moving and setup (the moving and set up will generally be *at least* a
<br>
thousand, and that's if you already have utilities hooked up and a septic
<br>
system in place; a septic system will cost you anywhere from $5000 to
<br>
$20,000+).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One needn't even work: standing on a city streetcorner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a &quot;Will Not Work for Anything&quot; sign will get you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the donations needed to survive.
</em><br>
<p>The only reason this works for some is that most people don't do it. Why
<br>
don't they do it?  The main reasons, aside from pride, are: 1. there are
<br>
only so many good begging locations per city, and these are generally
<br>
already taken; 2. One can do it for only so long before developing
<br>
respiratory and other health problems from breathing car exhaust for hours
<br>
each day -- and you do have to keep at it for several hours to get enough to
<br>
survive on, especially if you have kids to support; 3. Most cities have
<br>
ordinances that don't allow the solicitation of charitable contributions
<br>
without a permit.
<br>
<p>Also, bare survival isn't enough if you have children. All states in the
<br>
U.S. have laws that allow the state to take away one's children and put them
<br>
into foster care if the parent is not maintaining living conditions for the
<br>
children that meet minimum state standards. The state standards require a
<br>
dwelling that meets city codes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Today you can earn enough to support yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a similar manner by working only a few months.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look around you, Robbie.  Farmland is as cheap as,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, dirt.  It costs practically nothing.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Practically nothing&quot; is quite relative. You can pick up land in the middle
<br>
of the desert for just a few bucks an acre, but most tracts of land on the
<br>
market are in the thousands of acres. Small tracts cost more per acre,
<br>
because you're paying for the costs of subdividing, plus the seller's cut
<br>
for putting the deal together, plus the agent's cut for marketing the land.
<br>
So you might end up paying $3000 for a five acre tract, but you'd get a
<br>
piece of land fifty or a hundred miles from the nearest town with no
<br>
water -- useless for anything other than sort-term recreational camping.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there is little need for all that effort.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers will let poor people glean the fields after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a harvest today
</em><br>
<p>Even if this were so (and usually it's not), how one is to live for a year
<br>
on a grocery bag full of gleaned milo? Even supposing you could somehow
<br>
glean a year's worth of calories (for a small active person that would be
<br>
more than 6000 potatoes or the equivalent in some other crop --  [2500
<br>
calories per day / 150 calories per potato x 7 days/week x 52 weeks/year]).
<br>
Where, pray tell, are you going to store 6000 potatoes? Remember, food
<br>
production is seasonal.
<br>
<p>One can actually glean a lot more food in cities than on the farm. Grocery
<br>
store and restaurant dumpsters are rich sources; and one can get
<br>
supplemental protein by trapping rodents and birds and eating insects (if
<br>
one can develop a taste for them, insects are probably the most efficient
<br>
sources of protein).
<br>
<p>Long as you've got a digestive system of iron and you aren't too picky, you
<br>
can eat. The greatest problem is finding shelter. Most cities don't take
<br>
kindly to people camping out under freeways and in public parks.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There is plenty of land in the U.S. which cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be farmed *profitably* for various reasons, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is still perfectly farmable for food production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a family scale, as demonstrated by the Amish.
</em><br>
<p>The following items, possessed by the Amish, would cumulatively cost
<br>
thousands of dollars for the person just starting out: wagons and horses or
<br>
mules (or the internal combustion, steam, or electric equivalent) for
<br>
hauling compost, building materials, harvested food and so forth;
<br>
water-tight and pest-proof structures for food storage; fencing for farm
<br>
animals and to keep critters out of gardens (this is not a trivial expense);
<br>
source of water and means of getting water to where it's needed; shelter for
<br>
humans and farm animals; means of heating shelters in cold weather; tools
<br>
for cultivating land, constructing buildings, chopping and splitting wood,
<br>
etc.
