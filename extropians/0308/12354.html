<p><em>&gt; Hmm. I'm not saying that there aren't people who have died, by suicide or

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;deaths&quot; can succeed, let alone legal action.
</em><br>
<p>There are at least two stages under which prosecution could proceed under
<br>
Sections 318 and 319 against Premier Gordon Campbell and his accomplices
<br>
in government. The first stage is the &quot;anti-hate stage&quot;. Chief
<br>
Ahenakew of Saskatchewan has been charged according to this provision. He
<br>
certainly did not have the means to carry out an action which would have
<br>
annihilated the entire identifiable group (Jews) but his words are
<br>
arguably those which would incite hate and destructive action toward that
<br>
identifiable group and on a probability basis, that could cost lives.
<br>
<p>Thus the first part of the argument against Campbell et al before the
<br>
Citizens' Court of Justice would be that they are inciting hatred toward
<br>
an identifiable group, ie poor people. After all, what could be more
<br>
hateful than saying the lives of these people are not worth so much as a
<br>
crumb from the table at government expense, after April 1/04? What if
<br>
Ahenakew from any social position had said that about Jews or any other
<br>
identifiable group? That would certainly be added to his list of hate
<br>
comments. And remember that Campbell is saying this from a position of
<br>
power. Moreover, HE IS ACTING ON THIS POLICY with programs which will take
<br>
effect soon. So he is far more advanced in his hate campaign than
<br>
Ahenakew.
<br>
<p>On BC Rants we could ask Fred if his calling a member of the targeted
<br>
group, Marcus MacGregor an &quot;arsehole&quot; and otherwise saying the life of a
<br>
Marcus is not worth spit, is fostered in part by Campbell's genocidal
<br>
policies and programs. BTW, Marcus is at a dangerous point in his hunger
<br>
strike, past the 20 day mark when some organs like kidneys can start to
<br>
fail. Is Marcus an early victim of Campbell's genocide? Certainly his life
<br>
is at risk as Bobby Sands died after 40 days of a hunger strike.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if anybody has details of such deaths, would they kindly give them
</em><br>
<p>The second stage of the argument before the Citizens' Court of Justice is
<br>
that Campbell et al are acting in such a way which could reasonably be
<br>
expected to cost lives on a probability basis. You have heard the argument
<br>
that Campbell et al are inflicting a MEDICALLY DIAGNOSABLE ILLNESS in the
<br>
identifiable group, ie Adjustment Disorder (DSM). If you doubt that, ask
<br>
for other expert opinions. Ask Mayor Dr. Larry &quot;I will do anything to save
<br>
a life&quot; Campbell. Ask the BC Medical Association.
<br>
<p>Like other serious illnesses, if you have a large enough identifiable
<br>
group and enough time, you will get fatalities: for AD as well as Hep C or
<br>
SARS or what have you. Have there been such fatalites? Maybe. But who is
<br>
making an effort to find out? MHR is doing its Exit Surveys for the
<br>
opposite purpose, ie to COVER UP the crime. They locate 1/3 of the
<br>
&quot;exiters&quot; (from welfare) and crow about how well they are doing. But
<br>
&quot;high end&quot; exiters have always done well. MHR is making no concerted
<br>
effort to find the 2/3 who are &quot;missing persons&quot; in their books. If MHR
<br>
were concerned, they would give police a random sample from the 2/3 and
<br>
say, We are concerned that these might be missing persons like the dozens
<br>
of women still missing who are thought to have been additional victims of
<br>
the the accused serial murderer, Pickton.
<br>
<p>Do we know if some of the 2/3 are on police missing persons records? No
<br>
...and so far nobody has tried to find out how successful Campbell has
<br>
been at targeting an identifiable group which just by coincidence voted
<br>
&quot;the wrong way&quot; in 2001. How many has this serial murderer premier
<br>
successfully murdered so far? If none, then just give him and the Fascist
<br>
Freds enough time.

<em>&gt; &gt; designed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prevention and early intervention. Planning extinction of an entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;identifiable group&quot; is not required. Sections 318 and 319 of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Code can be invoked and have been invoked at early stages of hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; targeted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on identifiable groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That sounds like progress, although an amendment should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; passed saying that it is okay to hate *certain* groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The legislation refers to &quot;identifiable groups&quot; in those words and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;lists groups identified by ethnicity, race, religion and colour as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;examples. But it does not say this is an exhaustive list of protected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;groups. Nor does it say that there are identifiable groups which cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;targeted with hate messages. For example, it does not say we cannot by law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hate serial murderers. The Acts also protect free speech by saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fair comment in the context of political-religious discussion is allowed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Overall, it seems the PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE prevail in these Acts. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;example, even though garden gnomes and other vertically challenged people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are not given explicit protection by the Acts, a campaign of hate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;targeting for destruction against the vertically challenged in Canada
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;could be prosecuted under this legislation; or the current campaign of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hate which the present BC Government has targeted on poor people. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;list does not want to hear our local political-judicial issues but we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have proof by Olympics 2010 that the Campbell Government has killed more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;innocent citizens than any serial killer in North American history. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will then receive the attention of the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Just follow the links from Campbell's Olympic Gold for Serial Murder on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;POC's home page. The proof will be in the facts which we have by 2010.
