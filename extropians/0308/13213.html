This thread strikes an interesting cord for me. In my opinion one of the 
<br>
unaddressed (and unintended) consequences of unbridled capitalism(*) is that 
<br>
over time natural resources, i.e. land, slowly ends up in the hands of a few. 
<br>
Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by a few very 
<br>
rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining population. For an 
<br>
in-depth exploration of one way to solve this pop over to www.henrygeorge.org 
<br>
and do some reading.
<br>
<p>(*) I'm not so good at economic terms but what I mean by capitalism is a 
<br>
system where ownership of capital (i.e. land etc.) is fundamental to the 
<br>
economic system.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Minimum wage is below subsistence levels for families with children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it is just barely subsistence in large metro areas for just one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; We expect more now, so it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; come as no surprise that it costs more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Actually, we expect less.  For instance, it seems perfectly reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for people to pay 200-600k for a CONDO in West LA/Santa Monica.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Now, if you're a decent earner (90k-150k) that'll take you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;approximately 30-years to pay for assuming you spend less than half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;your earning on your home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If you're a &quot;not-quite-so-decent&quot; earner and are in the &quot;average&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;category, 40-60k, you can't afford to buy a condo in West LA/Santa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Monica - EVER.  You can get the same kind of thing in Pasadena or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Now, compare to just 40 years ago - my Grandfather bought his VERY NICE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;house in Arcadia (kind of an upscale Pasadena at the time and now) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;20k (which was A LOT).  He was a &quot;decent&quot; earner for the time and paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for his house inside of 10 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think a lot of this is due to how people who already own houses are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to keep people who do not own houses from building or placing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort of cheap residence (such as a mobile home) on property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearby (which is the only way you can get utilities at a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price--live near other people).  Once again, our laws and regulations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model animal societies, in that they are created by and used by those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who currently have power and status in order to preserve their power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and status. We call it NIMBY politics, but it is really about those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who &quot;have,&quot;  keeping down those who &quot;do not have.&quot;  Enforcement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarcity enriches those who &quot;have,&quot; and they do the enforcing through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;When he sold his house, he pocketed something like (I don't know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;exact number) 500k (1990) but obviously couldn't afford to re-buy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;same house with the money.  (He's happily retired in La Jolla just in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;case you were worried about him... 88 years old and still kicking!  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;closet transhumanist, he's blind and wants to have his eyes replaced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with artificial eyes, but can't because the FDA doesn't approve of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;surgery...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep. THat is one thing that everyone here agrees with--the FDA is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Earning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; subsistence level survival is cheaper and easier now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; than ever before, and getting more so all the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;20 seconds on Google will show this to be false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Try starting here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;<a href="http://www.weingart.org/institute/">http://www.weingart.org/institute/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; One needn't even work: standing on a city streetcorner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; with a &quot;Will Not Work for Anything&quot; sign will get you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; all the donations needed to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sure, if you don't mind sleeping in your own urine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I guess there is one way that living is cheaper today: our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agricultural technologies and market distribution systems are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient that we can buy enough beans and rice to survive for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pennies. But where do you cook it?  NIMBY politics  precludes this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifestyle through legal means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ...Then, you could pay for a piece of land capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; sustaining your own family within 7 years by working...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Today you can earn enough to support yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; a similar manner by working only a few months.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Well it depends on what you do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ebay - Real Estate, 40 acres (remember, 40 acres and a mule) with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;house - farmable land.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Generally well over 150k.  I don't know about you, but earning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;KEEPING 150k nowadays is a big deal &quot;for most people&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Look around you, Robbie.  Farmland is as cheap as,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; well, dirt.  It costs practically nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;More than 1000/acre generally.  You need about 40 acres to live on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that's 40,000.  I happen to have it, but then I make good money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;MOST&quot; people are negative in the cash arena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep. THat is one thing I have noticed about some of the people on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list--either they are all rich (Natasha seems to think many are), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think everyone is like them, or else they have totally bought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into--and never emerged from-- the dotcom-stock market bubblethink of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the late 90s. Or both....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;CF - <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/wop/jopovw/220.html">http://ideas.repec.org/p/wop/jopovw/220.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Mostly due to inflation, rising BASIC costs of real estate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;consolidation of income at the top 5% of earners, and of course the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;personal factors - lack of education, foolish spending, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or just plain old bad luck.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;Most People&quot; even though empirically are moving backwards in wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;creation still believe that they're saving money.  (If you put 2000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;into an IRA this year, you think you're saving money, but if you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;incurred more than 2000 in debt, you're losing money generally by 9% or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more.  &quot;Most People&quot; incurred more than 2000 in debt/negative finance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;last year.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; If all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; you need to do is eat, like the &quot;then&quot; people, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; is so simple even the hippies managed it, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; a fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Where'd you pull this one out of?  My parents were &quot;hippies&quot; that lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;on a commune for a short time.  Few of those succeeded.  Very, Very few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of them made it for more than 10 years.  I doubt you could find more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;than 100 examples of &quot;American Kibutz's&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; But there is little need for all that effort.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; farmers will let poor people glean the fields after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; a harvest today, and there is *plenty* of discarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; clothing available for nothing or nearly so, clothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; much more comfortable, durable, practical and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; fashionable than anything the &quot;then&quot; people could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; have managed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't know what makes you think this, but if you go onto the Dole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Pineapple farm in Hawaii, they'll shoot you.  And if you go into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Del Monte Tomato farms, they'll have you arrested.  &quot;MOST&quot; farmland
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that's producing now is owned and operated by major corporations that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;don't appreciate &quot;gleaning&quot;.  I think you're thinking of the Biblical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Law, but that was circa 4000 BC - TIMES HAVE CHANGED.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amen, brother!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you don't care for any of the luxuries that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; have today, the cars, the electronics, the internet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the medical care, the stuff that the &quot;then&quot; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't have, earning a living has become so simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; as to be trivial today.  sp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I don't know about you, but I pay $40/month for my home DSL and you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;buy a computer now for less than 200, plus another $100 or so for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;monthly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;On the other hand, food bills for a family of four are around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;$2000/month.  By FAR the biggest expenses are Rent/Mortgage and Food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amen, brother!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .......
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Which states that great progress has been made in health since the turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of the century BUT it does it's survey based on coal-mining.  Now, coal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mining while dangerous, is no longer as large an industry as it was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1900 and this study, while an interesting study of coal-mining related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;deaths, is just baloney WITH THAT HEADLINE.   The truth is, as it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;then, MOST PEOPLE DIE of accidental deaths, followed by whatever the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;current flavor of disease is (polio, cancer, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And the Extropic point in all of this is that the bottom line is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the death rate continues to be 100%.  Now you can make yourself feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;better about having better food (like In-N-Out) and better water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(probably false) but making a case for an overall improvement in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;quality and length of life is pretty hard when you actually look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;NOT THAT things can't be potentially better, just that they are MERELY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;potentially better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I really think that life is better than it was earlier this century,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly because of several important vaccines--polio, etc., and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of incremental engineering improvements and efficiencies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have given us a huge and efficient infrastructure that brings goods to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market like never before.  When it comes to engineering, everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to just keep getting better and better and better. At least in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the consumer marketplace.  But forget about organizations like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NASA--that is a joke....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, in combination with that, we have an accumulation of so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle class people which makes it very easy for products to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed and sold. This promise of potential profit from such a vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market of consumers offers an irresistible attraction for capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment.  And we benefit from that in so many ways....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in some ways, the extropian/freemarketeerism philosophy is correct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that it builds a better future--IN THE LONG RUN. But what about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that in the long run, we are all dead? (or at least that is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has worked till now....)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What I personally care about is making enough money to make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am cryopreserved in the best manner possible, and also while I am in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dewar, that the USA is able to maintain a STABLE culture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation in the meantime.  I could go on, but I need to work on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bathroom plumbing. WHy is it that women get so upset when the plumbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts up...some kind of evolutionary thing? How does this relate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunter gatherer lifestyles?....anyway....
