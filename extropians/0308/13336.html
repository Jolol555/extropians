</em><br>
<p>You make a strong point here, but I think the best refinement of what
<br>
I currently have is different from yours.  Yours has two problems: (a)
<br>
that &quot;mass murder&quot; is simply not strong enough (after all, it is used
<br>
to describe the murder of merely hundreds of people), and (b) the use
<br>
of &quot;genocide&quot; as you (accurately) describe it has exactly the correct
<br>
character of talking about eradicating a &quot;nation&quot;, because &quot;nation&quot; is
<br>
an appropriate term for any very large group of people with a common
<br>
characteristic that leads to common interests.  Re (a): even though we
<br>
accept that mass murder is bad in general, we are familiar with cases
<br>
where it has been deemed the lesser of two evils, so allowing others
<br>
to categorise delay in developing real anti-aging medicine as &quot;only
<br>
mass murder&quot; may invite wily challenges.  Re (b): in the same way that
<br>
it makes sense to refer to (e.g.) &quot;the Arab nation&quot; I think it is fair
<br>
(and even useful) to note that the set of people worldwide born in a
<br>
given range of years has a common interest (viz., the development of
<br>
real anti-aging medicine in a given range of years) that distinguishes
<br>
it somewhat from the corresponding interests of those born at other
<br>
times.  Hence they can reasonably be described as a &quot;nation&quot; for this
<br>
purpose.  I think your point can thus be met by a clarification of
<br>
&quot;genocide&quot; rather along the lines of my clarification of &quot;homicide&quot;
<br>
-- i.e. an acknowledgement up-front that I'm stretching normal usage,
<br>
but a justification of that stretching.
<br>
<p>Comments please, before I revise the existing text.

</em><br>
<p>My only disagreement with this statement is in respect of the use of
<br>
the word &quot;discover&quot;.  My position is that no one can adequtely know
<br>
whether they will want to live in a world with indefinite potential
<br>
lifespan until they experience it, nor whether others will want to.
<br>
Introspection is useless -- we have NO IDEA what we will think of such
<br>
a world.  All we can do is give ourselves the option.

</em><br>
<p>My only disagreement with this statement is in respect of the use of
<br>
the word &quot;adrenalized&quot;.  Most early death in wealthy nations from
<br>
violent causes has, until the past 58 years (fewer for the US), been
<br>
due to war, i.e. the conscious, considered, collective decision to
<br>
sacrifice huge numbers of people in the national interest.  My view
<br>
(hope, anyway) is that the success of wealthy nations in not going to
<br>
war with each other for far longer than has been seen since as far back
<br>
in history as I can establish may very well have resulted from a larger
<br>
value placed on human life these days than when adventitious mortality
<br>
from peaceful causes (such as infection) was much higher.  It is this
<br>
point that leads me to the opinion that we have a very good chance of
<br>
avoiding world wars indefinitely, without which my well-publicised
<br>
estimates of future life expectancy could not be fulfilled.
