<p>
This list has just gone through a paroxysm of anger and hurt over discussion
<br>
of current political issues.  Before continuing with this thread, please ask
<br>
yourself whether this is the right forum for discussions of this sort.
<br>
There are literally thousands of places on the net to discuss contemporary
<br>
political issues.  Other than those that bear DIRECTLY on the transhumanist
<br>
agenda, this isn't one of them.
<br>
<p>I know it's hard -- I did it myself today; and I'm already very sorry that I
<br>
did.  I just got back from a trip to the grocery store and the short time
<br>
away from the house gave me time to think.  Nothing I write here about
<br>
current political issues is going to change the minds of anyone who posts
<br>
something that I find so problematic that I'm moved to post on it.  The most
<br>
that I get from such a post is the momentary venting of partisan anger.  I
<br>
have a blog where I can do that and, if anyone is interested in what I have
<br>
to say about politics, they can go there.  I know there's a feeling that one
<br>
must say something, lest what one finds to be an outrageous statement go
<br>
unchallenged.  But nothing is really accomplished by that -- everyone knows
<br>
there are multiple sides to the current issues, and nothing is accomplished
<br>
by making a small mark on a scoreboard to note that &quot;here's someone on THIS
<br>
side of the issue.&quot;
<br>
<p>I've given up on the idea of encouraging &quot;civil dialogue&quot; on contemporary
<br>
political issues: There will always be people who will push the rhetorical
<br>
heat up beyond what a civil discussion forum can tolerate.  Draconian
<br>
policing of the list is a last resort.  So let me please enter a plea to
<br>
simply leave off from discussion of the hot-button political and ideological
<br>
issues.
