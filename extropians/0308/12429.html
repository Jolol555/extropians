<em>&gt; &gt; So in what way are we misreading predecessors? You do not give any

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; current knowledge and ideas).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's it: since these ideas have been around I think it's not productive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go through the motion of selling them again as &quot;new&quot; by grouping them under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a new brand; doing so sounds like a sleazy marketing move. Even if the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution of extropianism to these ideas would have been an update in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light of current knowledge, I'd say might as well also pick-up the old name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do it and to improve on it.
</em><br>
<p>So, what is the &quot;old name&quot;? It certainly isn't materialism, and I doubt 
<br>
it would make sense to say that we are Fourierians or Mirandolans. 
<br>
<p>I think you obsess too much about the label of the ideas. I care far 
<br>
more about where we are taking the ideas and how they might be 
<br>
developed; the spread of the ideas of the transhumanist stream does not 
<br>
primarily hinge on what we call the stream. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So our intellectual contribution should go to specifying what we mean by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialism, I don't see the need to make it a &quot;double-whammy&quot; but for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who do, I suggest immortalist materialist (would it be presumptuous of me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest my own interest, hedonist materialist wich is also an immortalism?
</em><br>
<p>But what about the transhumanists who are not materialists (like my
<br>
friend the christian transhumanist), or do not find immortalism to be
<br>
the key point (like Freeman Dyson)? Hedonist materialism sounds fun and 
<br>
has its strong adherents like Dave Pearce, but not all transhumanists 
<br>
are hedonists to the same extent. I think you will find that any label 
<br>
you care to set up will not cover the range of thought among the stream 
<br>
of thought, so why not make one up to cover it? Or define transhumanism 
<br>
as a particular form of humanism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; one who understands matter is very likely to be an immortalist so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply claiming to be a materialist is enough to tell about one's ethics etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anders, I'll get 'round the rest of your interesting answer later.
</em><br>
<p>Huh? Why should one become an immortalist by understanding matter. 
<br>
Epicuros was the quintessential (hedonic) materialist, but he was not an 
<br>
immortalist by any stretch.
