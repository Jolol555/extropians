----- Original Message ----- 
<br>
From: &lt;<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">Spudboy100@aol.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>Its not as if businessmen and women
<br>
<em>&gt; who have started suuccessful companies, themselves have achieved their
</em><br>
place on
<br>
<em>&gt; the boards of directors, and are now guiding companies. Rather, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suck-ups, who, with no sense of responsibility to their stockholders, let
</em><br>
alone,
<br>
<em>&gt; society at large, are guiding their corporations, right onto the iceberg.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not want cheap imported goods, I do seek the right to export abroad,
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; wish to increase competition, but not at the expense of the entire
</em><br>
republic,
<br>
<em>&gt; and I do object to the suffering of American workers at the hands of
</em><br>
fortune 500
<br>
<em>&gt; punks who would export all jobs, to line their own personal pockets. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally like many of the H-1B's and L2's that I work with, and do not
</em><br>
blame them
<br>
<em>&gt; personally for scumbag fortune 500 pricks, who would line their own
</em><br>
pockets,
<br>
<em>&gt; no matter what it does to the country.
</em><br>
<p>### This is an old defense - &quot;I really like my butler, he's black, but a
<br>
good man, nevertheless. But you couldn't let blacks work on their own,
<br>
listen to those scumbag abolitionists and set their own prices. They need
<br>
supervision, visas, regulations so they won't compete with me, so I can keep
<br>
my cushy job. Except for my butler, let them clean sewers&quot;.
<br>
<p>More quotes from a protectionist:
<br>
<p>&quot;And those bosses, they are worthless scum, every single one of them. In
<br>
fact, you can't become a manager unless you are a stupid, incompetent
<br>
suck-up.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And I didn't want to buy this imported car, really, but it was so cheap I
<br>
couldn't resist. Tell those loser GM bosses to get their act together, or
<br>
else I won't buy any of their cars. I have choice, you know.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And tell them suck-up bosses who don't want to hire me, better think it
<br>
over, or else I'll come over with some buddies, and you won't have no choice
<br>
nomore.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yep.&quot;
