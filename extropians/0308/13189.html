<p>There seems to be a point in researcher's lives where they come to the
<br>
conclusion they can't make any difference.  Just from my casual observations
<br>
I think Raj Sohal may have gone through a transition like that sometime in
<br>
the last couple of years.
<br>
<p>(Of course the way to answer this is to point out cryonics, but then
<br>
you have to point out reanimation strategies (e.g. Ralph's paper), then
<br>
you have to explan nanotech to &quot;disbelievers&quot; when Nobel prize winners
<br>
say &quot;it can't be done&quot;, etc.   Its a *very* long conversation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree, but a PhD does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically confer rationality in all facets of life.
</em><br>
<p>Richard Smalley being a possible case in point.  :-(
<br>
I could (and have) named others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's almost as if the majority of the

</em><br>
<p>How about &quot;Lord, grant me the strength to accept the things I cannot
<br>
change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know
<br>
the difference&quot;.
<br>
<p>The &quot;common sense&quot; wisdom is that you cannot evade death.  And they
<br>
have 2 very real things going for that side of the argument (a)
<br>
&quot;You cannot evade your hazard function&quot;; and (b) &quot;The universe will
<br>
someday be a very dark and cold place&quot;.  You trump (a) via something
<br>
like &quot;interstellar travel&quot; and/or &quot;uploading&quot; (of course these tend
<br>
to be only slightly less accepted than lifespan extension) :-;.  Then
<br>
you trumb (b) with something like Dyson's arguments, or Multiverse
<br>
arguments but they are on swampy ground as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, there is one anti life-extension argument that I cannot accept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet also cannot fully refute: overpopulation. The basic rebuttals are...
</em><br>
<p>Yep in the back of everyone's mind (or at least the educated people)
<br>
Malthusian concepts will creep into the discussion.
<br>
<p>Usually at this point one brings up nanotechnology and planetary dismantlement
<br>
and gets even more raised eyebrows.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. We need to get off the planet anyway. The problem with this rebuttal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that it assumes the cost of launching payloads will go down far enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and quickly enough to outpace the rate at which the population grows and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereby allocates resources away from space colonization toward day-to-day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival. This *may* happen, but we cannot assume that it *will*.
</em><br>
<p>Personal nanotech allows it (cheaply) as would &quot;public&quot; nanotech, e.g.
<br>
space elevators (there is a company in Seattle working on this, NASA
<br>
*is* funding the research).  You can also argue that if you live long
<br>
enough, and invest wisely early enough, then everyone ends up sufficiently
<br>
wealthy that they can use 30+ year old Soviet technology at $20 million a pop
<br>
to get off the planet.  You could also probably manage it quite cheaply
<br>
with a large mass driver, though you might need to be either frozen
<br>
or have a fair amount of &quot;in&quot; board nanotech to deal with the G-forces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. Anti-aging treatments could be conditional on the patient opting for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanent birth control.
</em><br>
<p>This is similar to the argument that Tom Kirkwood makes at the end of
<br>
his recent book.  You can reproduce, but only if you plan to end your
<br>
&quot;immortal&quot; life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would cause a massive cultural backlash in most of the world.
</em><br>
<p>Populations in Europe *and* Japan *are* declining.  The U.S. I think
<br>
is barely above the replacement rate.  (No legislation required at
<br>
all -- simply the means to control reproduction and perhaps a desire
<br>
to pass on more of ones intellectual or economic capital to ones
<br>
offspring.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. The earth's carrying capacity is unlimited. The problem with this rebuttal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that it's untrue. Granted, the environmentalists may be exaggerating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the immediacy of the overpopulation threat because of their own political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda. However at some point, be it in the next 50 years or the next 500,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *something* is *going* to become a limiting factor-- be it habitable land,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fresh water, or utilizable energy.
</em><br>
<p>Plenty of habitable land if you look at the density of New York City
<br>
or Tokyo.  We just have to think in 3D rather than 2D.  (I have
<br>
lived in NYC (both a typical brownstone as well as classical Manhattan
<br>
high rise), San Francisco area (both suburban house and city house)
<br>
and in Seattle &quot;neighborhood&quot;s (both condominium complex as well as
<br>
a tall thin house) -- all of these were relatively high density.
<br>
Humans *are* capable of adapting to high density environments.
<br>
<p>Plenty of fresh water if you can afford to remove the salt from it.
<br>
Plenty of solar energy as well as plenty of radioactive energy to do
<br>
this.  (Do you realize how many *tons* of plutonium are currently
<br>
being stored?)  And that doesn't even begin to tap the power we could
<br>
harvest from solar power satellites.  And don't get me started on the
<br>
the significant reductions in power per capita that advanced biotechnology
<br>
and nanotechnology will enable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Life extension will result in this bottleneck being approached faster.
</em><br>
<p>So what?  More people means more bright and creative people means the
<br>
singularity happens that much sooner.  (Only argument against this that
<br>
I know of is one that suggests that scientists become less productive after
<br>
they get married.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4. By keeping our geniuses alive longer, more concentrated expertise can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought to bear on all problems including overpopulation. Not impossible, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly speculative... we really have no way to even estimate the likelihood of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the overpopulation problem being solved in any given time frame.
</em><br>
<p>Phooey.  We *have* the technology to get people off the planet.  If it were
<br>
being mass produced it would be *much* cheaper.  We know there are probably
<br>
cheaper alternatives.  We do have the energy resources.  Long-lived people
<br>
*will* have the wealth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, I'm not presenting my own views here. I'm presenting opposing views I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot refute, and am seeking suggestions on.
</em><br>
<p>The problem with all of my comments above is that they are based on a decade
<br>
or more of nearly continuous self-education in a variety of fields.  Most
<br>
scientists will not have the depth of experience in a variety of fields
<br>
to be able to evaluate many of the claims I make above.  I believe that Eric
<br>
Drexler entered MIT about the same time I entered Harvard (circa 1974).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Aside, Somewhere in the Multiverse there is a Robert Bradbury who went to MIT
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of Harvard, met Eric Drexler, and became close friends with him...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be a very interesting universe to live in.]
<br>
<p>Anyway, Nanosystems, which was essentially Eric's PhD thesis, was published in
<br>
1992.  That means it took 18 years for someone who is probably one of the
<br>
brightest persons on the planet to accumulate enough knowledge to devise
<br>
a robust picture of nanotechnology.  A &quot;average&quot; scientist is *not* going to
<br>
easily grok anything one says about nanotech given most of the crappy summaries
<br>
that the press produce.  Scientists would really have to get *into* it -- that
<br>
takes time that most people do not have.  So you can't even use many of the
<br>
&quot;reasonable&quot; arguments above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; PS: I understand in general principle why the argument of death being &quot;good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the next generation&quot; doesn't hold up-- group selection is a very weak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary force. Does anybody know of a rigorous, quantitative paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining exactly what the limitations are on how much group selection could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have influenced evolution?
</em><br>
<p>Looks like Steve Austad has 4 pages on group selection in &quot;Why We Age&quot; (58-62).
<br>
I would start there.  The Gavrilov's might also discuss it but I can't lay
<br>
my hands on my that book right now.
<br>
<p>I think you are doing a good job anticipating the responses -- I don't
<br>
know however if it is possible to have a &quot;reasoned&quot; debate due to knowledge
<br>
scale differences.
<br>
