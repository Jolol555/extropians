<p>Ok, so you get great resolution -- what in the blazes are you going to
<br>
use to &quot;imprint&quot; the image on?  All photons above UV energy levels will
<br>
cause bond cleavage (Nanosystems, Section 6.5: Photochemical damage).
<br>
One of the big problems they are having with Extreme UV lithography
<br>
now is that they don't have materials that can withstand the damage
<br>
caused by the light at the smaller wavelengths.

<p>I don't see how you can disintegrate the box and not the hologram material.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The beam hits the black box, disintegrating it,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I can see it now, people show up at the airport, throw their luggage
<br>
onto the Gamma-Ray machine which subsequently vaporizes their luggage
<br>
while providing them with a data cube of what their luggage contained.
<br>
At their destination they throw the data cube into a matter compiler and
<br>
&quot;pooff&quot; out comes their luggage (presumably still rather warm from
<br>
the rapid assembly of so many molecules).  I expect it would make the
<br>
airlines very happy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is the wave-particle duality: in order to get the hologram we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to get enough photons on the screen to find the pattern, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies a very high intensity.
</em><br>
<p>No kidding...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anybody who knows more about gamma diffraction to give a considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion?
</em><br>
<p>I would think that how they manage to pull the rabbit out of the hat
<br>
with the Chandra telescope would be the place to start.  In particular
<br>
whether or not they studied the lifetime of the scope.  I'm believe
<br>
that you can detect X-rays with CCD detectors but I'm unsure of what
<br>
damage the detectors are exposed to in the process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think one way of hiding data better is to hide it in electron spins,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that might also show up in the hologram?
</em><br>
<p>I've never seen anything that suggests you can query the spins using
<br>
X-rays or gamma-rays (I will however ask someone who knows more than I
<br>
[my father] and get back if he speculates positively about this.)
