<p><em>&gt; There is a woman in Nigeria who may be stoned to death

<p>There was an Amnesty International petition I posted to the
<br>
list back on August 14. They claimed that a previous petition
<br>
had saved another woman from the same fate. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=56774">http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=56774</a>
<br>
The 27th of August seemed to be a key date according
<br>
to the petition organisers.  I'm now note the hearing has been
<br>
posponed until the 25th of September so folks can still sign it 
<br>
if they want to do something concrete on a personal basis.

<p><p><em>&gt;  If she is, do you suppose the rest of the world will stand idly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by and let that happen?  
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it is useful for us to think in such broad terms as
<br>
&quot;the rest of the world&quot;. As individuals we have, or can have,
<br>
more power than that. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we do, will we be able to face ourselves in the mirror? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we not rush in there and topple the &quot;government&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would carry out such a reprehensible act?
</em><br>
<p>No Spike &quot;we&quot; shouldn't. Not in my opinion. Not unless we
<br>
understand the wider ramifications. The wider ramifications
<br>
of usurping the UN and the sovereignty of countries is not
<br>
something we should do unless we know what it is that we are
<br>
doing. 
<br>
<p>I do not think the majority of people who &quot;supported&quot; the US
<br>
led invasion of Iraq understood what was being given up. Probably
<br>
neither did the majority of those (in the world) that opposed it.  
<br>
<p>We can't triage well unless we can see the costs as well as the
<br>
benefits. 
<br>
<p>I did not think the US should have invaded Iraq against 1441
<br>
and the UN because I did not think the end justified the means.
<br>
I still don't. 
<br>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time messing about (or actually I was being
<br>
quite serious) trying to find game theoretical solutions to the Iraq
<br>
problem as it was unrolling. I thought I found it but I could not
<br>
communicate it. The problem in communication was in part
<br>
because the issues were complex and peoples emotions were
<br>
up, but in large part it was because most folks (including me until
<br>
too late) did not have a sufficient understanding of the UN charter
<br>
and of the nature of sovereignty to weight the arguments properly.
<br>
<p>If we are going to start asking ourselves how we will look at
<br>
ourselves in the mirror if we don't take action maybe we also
<br>
start asking ourselves how well we appreciate such important
<br>
topics as say the US constitution (and the UN charter though
<br>
I think the UN charter is pretty much a dead duck now). If we
<br>
are not ready, and cannot bring an adult understanding to such
<br>
topics then our emotions and prejudices are unlikely to equip
<br>
us to do the triaging that is necessary.
<br>
<p>Without having a view on international law that has some 
<br>
coherence, I can't see that one can responsibly advocate either 
<br>
rushing in against international treaties and the principle of 
<br>
sovereignty or not doing so. 
<br>
<p>I think it behoves those who are intellectually, economically
<br>
and geographically able to inform themselves of at least the
<br>
basic principles of existing international law and of the US 
<br>
constitution so that they can be better lobbyists and triagers
<br>
within the system that currently prevails. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
