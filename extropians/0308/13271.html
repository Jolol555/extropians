Spike66:
<br>
&lt;&lt;To state that wind power cannot replace hydrocarbon 
<br>
burning is simply absurd.  We really can do it all with 
<br>
renewables: wind, water and sun.  Sure it would require 
<br>
a lot of costly infrastructure, but that is the beauty 
<br>
of capitalism: it gets things done.  Right now, so much
<br>
of our capital is idle, doing nothing but bidding up
<br>
the prices of each other's homes to absurd levels, such
<br>
as those seen in the Sillyclone Valley.  Let's cut that
<br>
nonsense and build something!&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>We can't drive automobiles on wind and solar power as yet. This is despite 
<br>
the TV jourmalism of the local variety; who spout on about solar cars, for the 
<br>
last 35 years. Let the engineers produce, as an example, a methanol powered 
<br>
vehicle, that has gotten its methanol from wind powered generators, via the 
<br>
splitting of water, and the combination of  a carbon source. Let us have a 
<br>
scientific estimate on how many windmills will be needed to replace oil wells, analyze 
<br>
the cost of production; and see if there is any profit at all!
<br>
<p>Alternatively, use beamed down power from Gigantic solar power sats, to split 
<br>
water into Hydrogen and oxygen; then add a carbon source and...you get the 
<br>
idea. There may actually be a dark horse energy miracle, if Craig Ventner is 
<br>
able to create a bacterium that likes to make plentiful amounts of hydrogen, 
<br>
without ruining the ecology of the oceans; should such a biug escape into the 
<br>
Pacific.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, there are some prodigious petroleum and natural gas sources 
<br>
that apparently have been ignored because of the massive volume and clever 
<br>
marketing of OPEC oil. Yet, that take political will to go after, and it looks like 
<br>
the current generation of pols, are fresh out of political will; them 
<br>
ignoramuses, corrupt, or both.
<br>
<p>Or have I missed your reasoning on this account? We have lots of technical 
<br>
demonstration devices; yet none that I have heard of are anywhere near 
<br>
affordable
<br>
