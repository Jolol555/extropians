<p>PENTAGON SCRAPS INFORMATION MARKET
<br>
<p>Even those who understandably scorned the Pentagon's recently 
<br>
cancelled Policy Analysis Market (PAM) -- a.k.a. the terrorism 
<br>
futures market, as some detractors called it -- should admit that it 
<br>
was innovative in a badly needed way.
<br>
<p>In proposing a virtual market to help predict contingencies in the 
<br>
Middle East and elsewhere, PAM set out to achieve what years of 
<br>
pseudo-reform of U.S. military and intelligence agencies had failed 
<br>
even to attempt -- to bypass the hierarchical bureaucracy that has 
<br>
led to numerous deadly intelligence failures.
<br>
<p>By making use of the knowledge of thousands of people willing to put 
<br>
their money on the line (maximum bet: $100), PAM was based on the 
<br>
insight that markets, driven by economic actors with powerful 
<br>
incentives to guess correctly, often know better than a handful of 
<br>
professional prognosticators. This point has been well illustrated by 
<br>
the web-based Iowa Political Stock Market, a virtual market that has 
<br>
consistently predicted election outcomes more accurately than 
<br>
pollsters.
<br>
<p>Because PAM was controversial for more than one reason, it should not 
<br>
be surprising that it was misrepresented by politicians and the media.
<br>
<p>&quot;Contrary to impressions in the media, the primary purpose of the PAM 
<br>
was not to predict individual events of terrorism but rather to 
<br>
predict inputs into terrorism such as the economic growth rates of 
<br>
countries in the Middle East, political instability, and military 
<br>
activity,&quot; write Alexander Tabarrok, research director of the 
<br>
Independent Institute, and Robin Hanson, the principal architect of 
<br>
the Policy Analysis Market, in a new op-ed.
<br>
<p>Rather, write Tabarrok and Hanson, PAM was to help answer such 
<br>
questions as &quot;What would happen to unrest in the Middle East if the 
<br>
US withdrew its troops in Saudi Arabia&quot; and &quot;How would Jordan fare 
<br>
politically if the 'roadmap' were successfully implemented?&quot;
<br>
<p>Recent history suggests that traditional approaches to such 
<br>
questions, even if well-informed, can become ignored or politicized.
<br>
<p>&quot;The yes-man phenomena means that information doesn't rise from the 
<br>
field to the decision-makers,&quot; write Tabarrok and Hanson. &quot;And 
<br>
sometimes the bosses don't want to hear what the field has to say. 
<br>
Remember the CIA and FBI analysts who repeatedly tried to signal 
<br>
their worries about terrorism to their superiors but were rebuffed? 
<br>
In contrast, a PAM would produce a public and easily understood 
<br>
number that would be difficult to ignore.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fortunately, the future of such &quot;information markets,&quot; &quot;prediction 
<br>
aggregators,&quot; or &quot;idea futures&quot; doesn't rest on government funding 
<br>
and would be managed better without it. A few visionary institutions, 
<br>
such as Hewlett-Packard, have already used them to aid in 
<br>
decision-making, and many more will be adopted. But as with so many 
<br>
innovations, don't expect the government to employ them effectively 
<br>
for a long, long time.
