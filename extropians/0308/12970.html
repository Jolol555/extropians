Sentdev reporting some rag called the Register:
<br>
&lt;&lt;How did it start?
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32170.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32170.html</a>
<br>
A few years ago a bunch of extremely wealthy Californians met, liked the 
<br>
look of each other a lot, and formed a group called Extropians. Revealed to 
<br>
the world in a Wired article in 1994 as &quot;a philosophy of boundless 
<br>
expansion, of upward - and outwardness, of fantastic superabundance,&quot; their 
<br>
greeting was described in some quite painful detail, for us, thus:
<br>
<p>&quot;Right hand out in front of you, fingers spread and pointing at the sky. 
<br>
Grasp the other person's right hand, intertwine fingers, and close. Then 
<br>
shoot both hands upward, straight up, all the way up, letting go at the top, 
<br>
whooping 'Yo!' or 'Hey!'&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, as long as the group does not succumb to &quot;conformity&quot; issues, its 
<br>
purported creation is immaterial. The writer is doing a BOE, not based on 
<br>
experience, but based on envy; which is a hallmark of the UK reportage.' We wish we 
<br>
were a world power too, and America must be controlled, especially by Laborite 
<br>
Britain, which is much wiser then the rest of humanity! That is the jist of this 
<br>
kind of thinking.
<br>
<p>There was an interesting sidebar concerning some women in the Silicon Valley 
<br>
who was getting screwed over, by off-shoring and such; but is that a real 
<br>
person or a composite, based on journalistic 'license' ?  
<br>
<p>Attacking Professor Hanson's theories, or suggestions was the weakest point 
<br>
in the article, and smacked of &quot;different is bad&quot; no matter how good, or poor 
<br>
the idea is. The idea that people taking bets on what kind of terrorism could 
<br>
happen, is not calous, but rather a sort of national or international Delphi 
<br>
Poll, that futurists have used to forecast with, since the early 1960's. 
<br>
<p>The old saying, that its better to be looked over, then overlooked, seems 
<br>
valid for Extropes and Transhumanists. Thanks for submitting the article, it was 
<br>
at least food
<br>
for thought!
