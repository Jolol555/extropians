Yes. The technology has been around since the 1960s, but it wasn't until the
<br>
1970's before we started getting a bit of an idea of how long duration
<br>
spaceflight affected our bodies. Even now, we aren't totally sure how such a
<br>
long duration in space would affectpur bodies and minds. The isolation alone
<br>
could pose a problem to the mind.
<br>
<p>Also, it could be far more dangerous than we know. Of all 8 landers sent to
<br>
the planet by the US and Soviet governments, only 4 have successfully
<br>
landed. Two totally disappeared without any clue as to why.
<br>
<p>Still, there have always been people willing to go.
<br>
<p>The problem is money. Most people simply don't see a real tangible immediate
<br>
benefit from going. It is too expensive for private companies to do. The US
<br>
government is too interested in getting re-elected and only supports
<br>
programs that will achieve that goal. Since the majority of people don't see
<br>
it as a priority, neither does the government. With such a lack of interest
<br>
in space, I am surprised the shuttle is even being returned to service.
<br>
<p>Just imagine how different things would be if we had discovered oil on Mars
<br>
when the Viking landers went there in the 1970s.

<em>&gt; For example we obviously have the theoretical capability to send humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Mars right now, and probably have had that capability since the 60's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (some aerospace buff please correct me if I'm off on this)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are right on, Alex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Why has this not happened already? Is it because &quot;people&quot; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;stupid&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, much simpler explanation: there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money to be made there.
