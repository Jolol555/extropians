<p>I don't think there is a &quot;wrong&quot; in this situation.  As Greg's recent
<br>
post points out there is a balance one has to strike to maintain the
<br>
tone and usefullness of a list.  I would not be on the list if Damien
<br>
or Eliezer were &quot;assaulting&quot; my opinions every day.  (Fortunately I
<br>
only stick my neck out far enough for them to (reasonably?) do that
<br>
somewhat less frequently.)  Damien was kind enough to point out to me
<br>
several posts in which Mike was rather abrasive.  I dealt with Mike
<br>
offlist to resolve the sources of what may have been misunderstandings
<br>
on his part -- but Mike is ultimately responsible for any such
<br>
misunderstandings.  (You can blame Enron for misrepresenting the
<br>
state of the company but it *still* comes down to a question of
<br>
whether or not one &quot;did ones homework&quot;.  The exchanges over the last few
<br>
months suggest that Mike did not do that.  Net result: misunderstandings,
<br>
aggressive and/or rude behavior, people taking offense, lost list members.)
<br>
<p>I do not believe that John is correct regarding &quot;improved the overall
<br>
quality of posts&quot;.  The general quality of the posts on this list is
<br>
very high.  So it would be difficult to &quot;improve&quot; on them.  The question
<br>
one is dealing with is when some people get into what are effectively
<br>
&quot;flame wars&quot;.  I've been reading lists for 20 years or more.  I've seen
<br>
wars come and go.  Usually the wars on the ExI list are reasonably
<br>
logical -- highly unusual as &quot;flame wars&quot; go (which is why I think it
<br>
was unfortunate that Harvey chose to leave).  The question ultimately
<br>
is how to manage such outbursts.
<br>
<p>I believe that the forthcoming changes may help with that.  The
<br>
development of a chat list will be a big step forward for people
<br>
who want to deal with a large volume list where discussions may
<br>
sometimes go on and on and on.  The addition of a multiple moderator
<br>
functionality (still in the process of being defined) will allow
<br>
for some checks and balances at that level.  I think it is better
<br>
to realize that it is difficult to get this &quot;right&quot; and that one
<br>
needs to be prepared to evolve and adapt.  The Extropy Institute
<br>
is trying to do that.
