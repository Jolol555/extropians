Lee Corbin:
<br>
&lt;&lt;What makes you feel it likely that you are speaking
<br>
for the typical American boss? That is not a rhetorical
<br>
question, I just want to know (you could be right).  My
<br>
own take is/was that we should expect ordinary free-market
<br>
competition to be working unless we have evidence to the
<br>
contrary. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Personal experience my man. These dudes and your occasional dudettes have 
<br>
spent their working lives as managers, starting with freshly minted MBA's; or 
<br>
marketing people (sales) or now (the ultimate liars) human resource cadres. Most 
<br>
of these managers have never operated a lemonade stand, yet they are given the 
<br>
reigns of business, through who they know. Some companies seem to succeed 
<br>
despite themselves, too.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The key is whether the American entrepreneur
<br>
and business leader still has what it takes.  If not,
<br>
how do you explain the failure of competition and Darwin?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Oh, they seem to have what it takes Lee, but there has been over the last 25 
<br>
years, a focus on fattening up the fortune 500 fiends, that the small business 
<br>
sector has been neglected. We have had, in the states, over 30 + years of 
<br>
successful lobbying to this end, by the big and uglies. Lee, social darwinism, is 
<br>
not darwinism. The 500 have mis-managed &quot;other people's money&quot; and have 
<br>
largely gotten away with it.
