</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; reaction moral or immoral....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was not meaning to say, as you seem to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, that acting or anticipating the actions of others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (especially when the actions of others are likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious even lethal) that one is necessarily operating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside of a  moral sphere. Quite to the contrary I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying, perhaps, not very effectively, to make the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that as subjective indivduals *all* of our judgements 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must necessarily be finally self-centric, including our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *moral* judgements. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, it follows to me, almost as day must follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; night, that whatever else one's moral system might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporate, it *cannot*, (if it is to be consistent and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have utility in guiding our actions and serving as a basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from which we might seek to form compacts with each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other) not incorporate the recognition that we must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honest with ourselves. I'm arguing that moral action is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precluded, that one cannot  be acting morally if one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not acting on one's own best comprehension of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .. in my opinion, anybody who says the statement that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are acting morally in a pre-emptive fashion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harms others, regardless of  the effect, is immoral; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insofar as no event has occurred to justify said &quot;response&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I cannot agree with this statement as a generalisation, as
<br>
there are some classes of pre-emptive action made on 
<br>
the basis of genuinely held, earnestly reasoned (note I 
<br>
am not touching *belief* here) views that would require
<br>
action in my view. Indeed sometimes there would be
<br>
a moral impetus towards action (even pre-emptive 
<br>
action). We cannot *know* for certain the actions of
<br>
others and we cannot always prudently wait for them
<br>
to do their worst before we respond. In the end it is
<br>
to our own judgement of the total risks that we must
<br>
hold true and then on that judgement we must act 
<br>
(including in *some* cases pre-emptively). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In relation to your secondary point (stated in this letter);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I really don't think morality has anything necessarily to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with self-delusion, or the acknowledgement thereof. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or rather, there is no truth that states necessarily you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be honest, ergo an act of dishonesty (as it relates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to self-delusion) does not violate any particularly great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.
</em><br>
<p>First the status of morality and the rationality of ethics is
<br>
pretty widely regarded at least so far as I am aware in 
<br>
philosophical circles as being almost a matter of opinion.
<br>
(eg. Bertrand Russell. History of Western Philosophy).
<br>
<p>I find this conclusion powerful, dangerous and deeply 
<br>
unsatisfying so I am keen to have at it. Let's be clear I may
<br>
fail but if I'm going down like Don Quixote, then I'm going
<br>
down &quot;having at&quot; one of the larger uglier philosophical 
<br>
windmills. 
<br>
<p>Ok. Now here's my point. Unless a moral code can
<br>
arise form a set of universals such as a propensity to
<br>
reason and a predispositon to sociability then there is
<br>
not likely to be much genuine agreement between 
<br>
subjective individuals on moral codes. Further those
<br>
who do not know endeavour to understand themselves,
<br>
what manner of creature they are, are not going to be
<br>
in a position to know what the most optimal compromises
<br>
for them are when compromises need to be made. A person
<br>
that deludes themselves that they are a different sort of 
<br>
creature with different sets of drivers and needs than they
<br>
actually have is precluded from sitting down at table
<br>
to negotiate for their own best interests because they do
<br>
not know their own best interests. A person that deludes
<br>
themselves willingly can hardly be a person that others
<br>
would want to engage in a moral compacts with. 
<br>
<p>Within the context of the time available I think individuals
<br>
ought to use pan critical rationalism in their approach to
<br>
understanding their own nature and then pursuing the
<br>
optimal outcome for them in accordance with their nature.
<br>
This optimal outcome will necessarily involve compromise
<br>
because others whose cooperation is needed will not if they
<br>
are enlightened and empowered (and likely to be good 
<br>
allies as a consequence) strike bad bargains.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or to put it more bluntly, sometimes self-delusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the ticket :) Ever wonder why (evolutionary-speaking)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have emotions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I reckon to the extent one is self deluded one will be screwed
<br>
at the negotiating table because perceptive others will recognize
<br>
you as having a lower sentience quotient and the only one to
<br>
blame for this if you are self deluding will be yourself.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now against this point it might be argued that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no circumstances where dishonesty with oneself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a moral matter. I conceed that this is the traditional view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but my contention is that that traditional view is wrong, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flawed, and lacking in utility. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fair enough, I'll bite :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am arguing that only those that can commit themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hold themselves to a rational moral code are in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position to have the sort of maturity that is required to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forge the sort of compacts that will best serve the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongest forms of cooperatives and the most extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; substitute &quot;ethics&quot; in for &quot;morality&quot; and I'd agree;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
So far I've been using morality and ethics without distinguishing
<br>
them particularly. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; morality to be is something generally provided for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by external sources (rather than derived by said people);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it also deals heavily with intention.  Now, I *really* don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care what people's intentions are, just their actions.  
</em><br>
<p>Of course you do. A person that you know was intending
<br>
to steal from you yesterday but did not for lack of an 
<br>
opportunity is likely to be filed as such and regarded as
<br>
such. If not you'd be suckered far more often than the 
<br>
norm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Intention are more of a heuristic to decide whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not someone's future actions will be favorable.
</em><br>
<p>They certainly are that. And a persons future actions, their
<br>
motives, their reputation are surely part of practical moral
<br>
deliberations on your part. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This discussion could all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be simplified by people adopting a non-intention based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, where people are judged by their actions, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements made by said people are evaluated in that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context (as actions).
</em><br>
<p>I am trying to establish the validity of the statement to 
<br>
thine ownself be true. You, I think, are trying to make me
<br>
make the case or to refute it.  I am not interested in a simple
<br>
moral system I am interested in a rational, teachable and 
<br>
extensible one. If I can teach a moral system that has high 
<br>
utility to those I teach it too, like teaching the principle of tit 
<br>
for tat, then I can be confident that the world will be that
<br>
much more pleasant and predictable for me as a result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not imagine that any of us ultimately succeeds in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding self delusion. But if the charge of hyper-rationality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ever a valid criticism I do not think it can be so on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters of morality where the individuals concerned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledge that their take on the universe is inherently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective and inherently selfish. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think there are degrees of self-delusion; I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important than self-delusion is the end effect that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-delusion has on the person as a total system.
</em><br>
<p>In almost all negotiations, and most moral matters between
<br>
persons involve a quid quo pro, the best possible outcome
<br>
for the individuals involved depends on them recognizing the
<br>
best possible outcome for them (without their being deluded
<br>
as to what they want or need) and then most closely
<br>
approximating it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is my contention that if we cannot find a harmony of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfish interests we will not find anything but the illusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of harmony at all. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; in other words, someplace where everyones needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are met... 
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely not. That is pure fantasy land. The best we can
<br>
hope to achieve is a reasonable compromise where all sit
<br>
down in good faith and recognizing that all are compromising
<br>
but all are gaining in the aggregate all act in accordance with
<br>
the agreement.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And in order for their to be a harmony of selfish interests 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their must be real recognition of the nature of oneself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ones needs. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a mapping of sensory input to available physical stimulus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats another possibility, sans recognition of one's own selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests.  
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't limit one's self understanding and ones understanding
<br>
of ones needs and desires to the mere physical. I think there
<br>
are social needs in most people that are very deep seeded
<br>
and go beyond the need for physical contact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Same goes for empaths (people with highly developed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities to sense what others are feeling off of physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [body, speech] cues).  They intuitively understand people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and respond sans a specific rational understanding of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  There's no reason (any empaths out there?) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that emotion-intuition is not being applied to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves (the equivalent of reflection).
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure what your point is here. Sociopaths are also
<br>
good readers of patterns. They just don't empathise. But
<br>
I would argue that sociopathy is dysfunction. And real
<br>
sociopaths would possible grin at me and say who needs
<br>
that sentimental bullshit anyway. And I'd say you do here's
<br>
why ..etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where I think it becomes important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to acknowledge to oneself that one can be rational and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one is by nature social. If one does not acknowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one is social one is not (by my reckoning) being true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to oneself and one does not have the sort of maturity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will enable one to be on good terms with oneself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to form real compacts that have a chance of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honored with others. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ooooh I don't know about that :)  You seem to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people are by nature, social creatures.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily think thats the case. Or to qualify, people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social by a matter of degree. 
</em><br>
<p>Sure but there is a baseline. The human infant is born in a 
<br>
state whereby it cannot support the weight of its own head. 
<br>
Humans are designed (selected by evolution) from the outset
<br>
to be social. The big brain that is useful later would otherwise
<br>
by a lethal liability shortly after birth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some are quite capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of going it alone while others would die if seperated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the herd. 
</em><br>
<p>Only after some initial basic social assistance has been rendered.
<br>
<p>Many infants get suboptimal social assistance and the outcomes
<br>
are often dysfunctional people. But they are not dysfunctional 
<br>
by choice. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So i question ur assumption that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is social.... Its obviously a core belief in ur system, and certes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally speaking, it is the case that most people are social.
</em><br>
<p>Belief has nothing to do with it. I have learned and observed human
<br>
infants I know that physiologically they cannot survive without 
<br>
assistance - that they wish to survive - that they suckle if they can
<br>
and cry if they can't is not a matter of mere belief.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But not all.
</em><br>
<p>Not all to the same degree. But there is no person alive at
<br>
present (to the best of my knowledge) with the power to stay 
<br>
alive without cooperating with others. It is not necessary that
<br>
social be about niceness it is better, more funcitonal, if it is
<br>
about an enlightened understanding of frailty and the benefits
<br>
of cooperation. I would argue that tyrants that aim for the short
<br>
glorious life of Archilles in 2003 are short changing themselves.
<br>
They are sub-optimally selfish. With a tweak of their value
<br>
systems they may be able to satisfy more of their needs and
<br>
desires by cooperating. But many of them would have to 
<br>
re-learn and I'd expect few of them to change what has worked
<br>
for them if they could not be presented with a compelling
<br>
argument. If there is no compelling argument that can be made
<br>
to their self interest then I would say that no real moral argument
<br>
is being put to them at all.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there was a creature that by nature was not social in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any sense I would grant by my notion of morality that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that creature would have no duties to others and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that creature would not be acting immorally in anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it did to others.  If one is sure that one is being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatened by a genuine sociopath by my moral reckoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one would not only be permitted to act in ones defence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one would be morally obliged. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see now I wouldn't go that far; just because ur being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatened by a sociopath does not necessarily mean they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will carry out that act;  there's a whole subset of sociopaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that lead &quot;normal&quot; lives without going through the murder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sprees that characterize their (by our definitions) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less-successful brethern.  I think thats more of a policy issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to be decided upon by each individual)....
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly right. In the end the individual must decide moral
<br>
policy for themselves. The intelligent individual will take into
<br>
account existing social mores and laws but in the end they will not
<br>
shirk the responsibility of the moral decision. They cannot. To
<br>
shirk is the allow defaults to go into play.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In practise I would have some residual doubts about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the completeness of the sociopathy of even a creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as Hitler so I would not feel completely free to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exterminate him with extreme prejudice unless I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made a good faith reckoning as to the nature of him 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a threat to what I value. Then having made a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best a rational determination of the nature of the threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I could given the time and context I would feel free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exterminate him with exteme prejudice and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would expect to feel no guilt but only some misgivings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that had I more time I might have judged better. ie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My concept of morality is I think in that sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical. And it is extensible. If others share it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they act rationally and in accordance with their selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  best interests as they perceive it I can (in the context) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this moral system have not fault them morally.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now don't u see a contradiction therein? What if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sociopath, or even loony person (to broaden the set),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is merely acting to fulfill his own utility (ergo munching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on ur spleen or the like)?  I mean, just because someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else is &quot;selfishly&quot; (is their any other way?!) pursuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there own interests, doesn't necessarily mean ur own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral code should approve their own...
</em><br>
<p>No my moral code would tell me if this person is reasonable
<br>
I can point out that their aspiration to munch on my spleen
<br>
is well recognized by me and that that is not a circumstance
<br>
that I can permit to prevail. Either we reason out a conclusion
<br>
together or we fight to the death now. I then invite them to 
<br>
do their calculations of cooperation vs competition and 
<br>
consider how the agreement if it is to be cooperation will be
<br>
effectively honored. If at any stage I feel that my appeals to
<br>
their reasoning is hopeless then I fall back on trying to kill
<br>
them before they kill me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Paul]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Pretty much the only time u can consider something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral or immoral is after the event has occurred, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then, only for urself.  Morality has absolutely no import
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a pre-emptive doctrine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]I don't agree. By my reckoning of morality, when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals agree to cooperate with each other for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutual advantage (perhaps at some cost to them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other dimensions were they reckoning their best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests separately) there is a moral bond between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; according to ur definition of morality :)
</em><br>
<p>Yes. According to a system I'm offering up for consideration
<br>
because I think there is some consistency and utility in it
<br>
and because if I am right and it is teachable I will benefit
<br>
by shifting the cooperate compete decision more towards
<br>
cooperation (just as if I had taught the principle of tit for tat). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Paul]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyone that believes to the contrary has not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationally examined the situation.
</em><br>
<p>Depends what you mean by belief. Belief is a problem word
<br>
for me because a lot of people who are doing more than
<br>
mere believing use the word belief to indicate a sort of less
<br>
than certain knowledge. The problem is that some people that
<br>
use the word belief may have done no personal processing
<br>
on the issue at hand at all but may have simply adopted 
<br>
wholesale something that they were indoctrinated with. 
<br>
<p>If you are implying that my proposed moral system is flawed
<br>
or inconsistent or unclear then, yes, I am willing to accept that
<br>
that could be in fact a valid criticism but I'd ask you to point
<br>
out where because as I've said trying to find means of 
<br>
increasing cooperation and putting morality and ethics on a 
<br>
more rational footing is a worthwhile task.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [brett]To be frank, I am doubtful that the word belief can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be validly coupled (except as crude linguistic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shorthand for &quot;this is my operating hypothesis&quot;) with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rational examination of  any situation. Belief is often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used by fairly rational people in just this short hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; belief =&gt; a statement a rational agent holds true. 
</em><br>
<p>Many use it like this. I don't like it because I spend a lot
<br>
of time considering the politics of language and communication.
<br>
<p>I think that if an extrope is debating with a flat earther in front
<br>
of an open minded audience and the audience is only partly
<br>
paying attention and they hear the extrope talking of beliefs
<br>
on the one hand and the flat earther talking of beliefs on the
<br>
other the audience may be seduced into thinking one belief may
<br>
be just as good as the other. I think it is in our interests to 
<br>
get some probability and quantifiability into the discussion. Belief
<br>
is language which serves the preservation of the status quo. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Brett] By the code of morality I have tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe, belief qua belief is immoral. This is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when one is believing one is not reasoning and when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is not reasoning to the route of ones selfish best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest one is groping with a less than optimal method. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depends on how u define it :) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. And I don't think extropes generally define it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do, but my point is that people who hear belief being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used may be people we are trying to persuade and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behooves us to use the most persuasive language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Belief is a poor word for conveying significant amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of intellectual exercise. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And certes, just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you believe something doesn't necessarily make it false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or ill-advised); classic example, I believe the sun will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise tomorrow morning...  Of course the veracity of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement will require observation tomorrow morning; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the belief is both advisable and statistically speaking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly certain...  In other words, belief and logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not necessarily at odds; it depends on how you define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>My point is that when you speak in a political forum you do
<br>
your own thought process which is based on considerably 
<br>
more than mere indoctrination by another (I hope) a disservice
<br>
when you use the word belief instead of another word. (This
<br>
is because not everyone who hears you use the word belief
<br>
knows that you will have done more processing. It seems to
<br>
me that many extropes fail to realise that the audience, the rest
<br>
of the world doesn't give away free credibility points for one
<br>
wacky belief over another.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]My contention is that as soon as one becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;believer&quot; one has ceased to hold to the principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of to thine own self be true - unless one is incapable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reasoning - (or one must reach a tentative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion based on the imperative to live and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act in real time). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; hahahaha :) re - ur last qualification :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well since we're all stuck in this current universe... :)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but again I'd go back to pan critical rationalism.
<br>
<p>Without ever getting absolute certainty there are techniques
<br>
which we can learn which give us a much higher probability
<br>
of getting a correct (a useful) answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Generally speaking, I have no use for morality;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just ethics [standard api, consistently adhered to, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logically derived, based on reality]....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]I'm reading api as 'application programming interface'. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; yuppers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [brett]&quot;Generally speaking&quot; I suspect you are unlikely to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoy discussing morality and/or ethics much further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with me ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; it doesn't really bother me, if thats what u're asking :)
</em><br>
<p>I was asking. I don't enjoy boring people, I just risk it ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I've pretty much made up my ethical system, at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of the larger ruleset (meta-rules)... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the smaller &quot;behaviors&quot; are data-driven  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (tit-for-tat, etc) :)
</em><br>
<p>As indeed in practice most of us have. If I am right and a 
<br>
better more universal ethical system can be derived I would
<br>
expect that in most peoples cases there would be very little
<br>
observable differences in how they'd behave. But then on the
<br>
other hand when one starts to routinely reason as oppose
<br>
to believing one is in a position to converse mind to mind
<br>
with other reasoning beings. Beliefs can very easily become
<br>
entrenched positions. I think to reason when reason is 
<br>
available is more social and because I think humans are
<br>
social (their interests are best served by cooperation) to 
<br>
reason is moral to believe is not.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
