</em><br>
<em>&gt; only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freely accepted obligations, such as in a contract (by definition, a

</em><br>
<p>Couldn't I be brave solely in relation to familial and filial 
<br>
relationships and be a complete coward when it comes to fulfilling my 
<br>
contracts?
<br>
<p>Example: if I fail to deliver a piece of equipment to you on monday 
<br>
because some troglodytes were cutting off the road and I didn't feel 
<br>
like running the gauntlet, then according to your moral system I should 
<br>
be blamed because obliged due to contract?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A contract must be explicit to be enforced.
</em><br>
<p>However, lacking any explicit agreement with my children about when I 
<br>
will be there to save them, if II fail to pass the road due to 
<br>
cowardice on my part and my son dies as a result with my full 
<br>
knowledge, I'm not to be ashamed or blamed?
<br>
<p>But we're very close.  There is a familial and filial contract implicit 
<br>
in human-being but state-enforced contracts almost always arise as a 
<br>
result of coercion.  Similarly economic contracts tend to be backed by 
<br>
force and coercion either explicitly or implicitly.  An example of an 
<br>
IMPLICIT form of coercion might be forcing people to take minimum wage 
<br>
jobs and drive three hours to their work because that's the only work 
<br>
available for them - and because the education system set up to provide 
<br>
them with necessary skills to either provide for themselves or get 
<br>
better jobs has utterly failed them, but apparently deliberately.
<br>
<p>Have you heard of the &quot;Learn to Work&quot; program?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### I'd rather think that what I refer to is not bravery, just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Bravery&quot; is a term too burdened with tribalistic, gory images. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Invariants in &quot;Golden Age&quot; (John C. Wright) are not brave, merely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calmly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational, incapable of fear, incapable of bravery. This is my ideal.
</em><br>
<p>It's another word-game, apparently directed at emotivism.  I suggest 
<br>
that your attempts to curb the use of emotionally laden words in this 
<br>
context is just ridiculous.  Cowardice and Bravery and Goodness are 
<br>
emotionally laden terms.   If we didn't CARE about what we were doing, 
<br>
then there would be no good, no bad, no cowardice, not bravery, not 
<br>
even any &quot;calmly rational&quot;.  All words are value laden, some of those 
<br>
values are more emphatic than others.
<br>
<p>All you really do by setting up such dichotomies is to change the word 
<br>
game, the question then becomes WHY are you changing the word-game?  
<br>
What does it gain you to change the word-game?   Why not adopt bravery 
<br>
and help people see bravery &quot;your way&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### It is not my prerogative to define other sentients' self-interest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. I can however hypothesize that it is, similar to mine, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of whatever goals they act to achieve, ideally in the presence of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information needed to evaluate those goals in reference to other goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strive for. Therefore, &quot;goodness&quot; is for me getting what humans really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the ideal society is the one that best serves the achievement of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average Rawlsian human's goals, including my own personal goals. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goodness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then defined in the context of my self-interest, not the other way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around.
</em><br>
<p>Getting what WHICH humans really want?  If your predictive statement 
<br>
&quot;Goodness is what tends to produce good results in the long-run&quot; is to 
<br>
have any force, you're going to have to say which humans, since 
<br>
different humans want very very different things.  It doesn't help to 
<br>
move it up to &quot;on the average&quot; at the societal level since it may be 
<br>
that 1)  people don't have large-scale agreements about what is good 
<br>
and 2) &quot;on the average&quot; what people want isn't very good.
<br>
<p>&quot;Most People&quot; want to gain at other people's expense.  It's the first 
<br>
rule of capitalism - buy low, sell high.  We can call this the modern 
<br>
equivalent of original sin.
<br>
<p>&quot;Most People&quot; don't agree about what they want - shoot, most people 
<br>
don't even know what they want themselves.  But just about EVERYBODY 
<br>
can tell you whether or not you should torture children.  Good is much 
<br>
more concrete than this abstract &quot;what people want&quot; thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Doubtful.  Calm rationality and long-term outlook has made this world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the way it is NOW.  Is this the best world there can be? (in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more than a tautological sense.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Today's world the result of calm rationality and long-term 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlook?!!!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You really meant it?
</em><br>
<p>Definitely.  On the part of a few very wealthy and powerful people who 
<br>
have had and continue to have extraordinary power.
<br>
<p>It's the explanation for why the same group of people, generation after 
<br>
generation, enjoy privilege and rank while their counterparts though no 
<br>
less intelligent, talented, ambitious and cunning, fail to ascend to 
<br>
the ranks.
<br>
<p>This group of people changes occasionally during revolutions (usually 
<br>
followed immediately by an equally terrifying bunch, sometimes by the 
<br>
same terrifying bunch that was just ousted), but by-and-large, yes, 
<br>
calm, collected, coldly rational self-interest drives the ruling 
<br>
classes methods for controlling the rabble.  This is why, for instance, 
<br>
George H.W. Bush didn't have his son sent to war but was perfectly 
<br>
happy to send lots of other people to die there.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
