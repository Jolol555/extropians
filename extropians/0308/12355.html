Party of Citizens writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That sounds like progress, although an amendment should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; passed saying that it is okay to hate *certain* groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The legislation refers to &quot;identifiable groups&quot; in those words and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists groups identified by ethnicity, race, religion and colour as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples. But it does not say this is an exhaustive list of protected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, by no means.  The never ending task of identifying which
<br>
groups cannot be hated is one of the primary responsibilities
<br>
of enlightened governments everywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nor does it say that there are identifiable groups which cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targeted with hate messages. For example, it does not say we cannot by law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate serial murderers.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, thanks for the clarification.  Of course, were serial murderers
<br>
to organize into a voting bloc or rights group, naturally that would
<br>
be different.  But it makes perfect sense that mere collections of 
<br>
people, e.g., &quot;white persons&quot; should not be conflated with actual
<br>
pressure groups or identifiable ethnic groups united by genuine
<br>
solidarity due to oppression, discrimination, racial consciousness,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Overall, it seems the PRINCIPLES OF JUSTICE prevail in these Acts. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, even though garden gnomes and other vertically challenged people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not given explicit protection by the Acts, a campaign of hate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targeting for destruction against the vertically challenged in Canada
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be prosecuted under this legislation; or the current campaign of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hate which the present BC Government has targeted on poor people.
</em><br>
<p>I am afraid that you are confusing genocide with campaigns of hatred,
<br>
which are not always the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This list does not want to hear our local political-judicial issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we may have proof by Olympics 2010 that the Campbell Government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has killed more innocent citizens than any serial killer in North
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American history.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there can be little doubt from the link on your page, 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/campbellsserialmurderolympicgold/">http://www.geocities.com/campbellsserialmurderolympicgold/</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campbell's Genocide is a cleverly pre-planned, pre-meditated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attack on an &quot;identifiable group&quot; of known political-cultural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies, ie a population which has a long record of voting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against his political party and political interests.  Common
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense tells us that his calculated policies and programs will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take many lives according to the &quot;odds&quot; or statistics.  What
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has underway is COLD BLOODED MURDER, more sinister for that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason than the murders by the Port Coquitlam Pig Farmer. This
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;premier is a murderous psychopath. There is no &quot;time clock&quot; on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prosecution for genocide. In time, Campbell, Plant and their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplices will be brought to justice.
<br>
<p>and, more sinister by far, the missing persons!  Extropians have
<br>
just responded to a plea to those who know of direct victims of
<br>
terrorism, and the call should probably go out to those who are
<br>
aware of Canadian missing persons.  Speak up!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2001, several &quot;Exit Surveys&quot; of persons who have left
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MHR rolls have been used to cover up the missing persons of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MHR. Only about 1/3 of those surveyed have been interviewed. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has to do with the 2/3 and the missing persons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implications. The Campbell Government has cleverly focused
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attention on the 1/3, falsely asserting that this proves
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success for their policies and programs.  They distract
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attention from the 2/3 missing to MHR.
<br>
<p>Ah, but it would be well to remember that these figures can have
<br>
relevance only against the normal background frequency of those
<br>
abducted by aliens.  The actual figures could be far less, because
<br>
abductions by flying saucer also target the same group:  the poor,
<br>
the defenseless, those least likely to be missed!
<br>
<p>But my main point is that such programs of extermination do *not*
<br>
necessarily have to be characterized by hate.  It is true that
<br>
historically, most pogroms have indeed been spawned by the hatred
<br>
of groups convinced of their own racial or class superiority, but
<br>
in this day and age, remember that such campaigns could be carried
<br>
out by cold-blooded people like those you expose merely for short-
<br>
term political advantage---no real hate involved.  Likewise, a lot
<br>
of the hate prohibited by the enlightened Canadian legislation
<br>
does not affect groups whose hatred (e.g. of the Campbellites)
<br>
would in turn lead to pogroms or genocide.
