<em>&gt;in this thread was grossly partisan.  As others pointed out, the first part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of it was waaay over the top in ascribing problems with the economy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;George Bush.  Yesterday morning I heard an interview with an economist on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fairly left-leaning NPR (can't recall his name) in which the economist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointed out that the over-all performance of the economy was a much larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factor in the current recession and projected federal government budget
</em><br>
<em>&gt;deficits than the Bush tax cut.  The recession was well under way when Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was elected 
</em><br>
<p>In my opinion, the current jobs recession, like most recessions,  is
<br>
mainly about perceptions about whether it is wise to increase or
<br>
decrease or maintain spending.  These perceptions are very powerful
<br>
force vectors. When the November 2000 presidential election popular
<br>
vote/electoral vote crisis was ongoing, Bush (or his spokespeople)
<br>
began to speak about how the crisis needed to be resolved quickly (a
<br>
quick resolution being in his favor).  
<br>
<p>During the height of the crisis, Bush said that unless the crisis was
<br>
resolved quickly, a recession might be precipitated. Well, his own
<br>
words (or those of his partners in crime) about a possible impending
<br>
recession were perhaps the initial get-the-ball-rolling force vector
<br>
that began the jobs recession we now have.  Bush's words --
<br>
disseminated worldwide by a media feeding frenzy--fueled nascent
<br>
perceptions of an impending recession,  
<br>
<p>Bush and his GOP henchmen, like Gore and his Democrat henchmen, see
<br>
our nation simply as a pawn in their lust for power.  As far as I can
<br>
tell, this attitude runs rampant in the Halls of Power in a completely
<br>
BI-PARTISAN fashion.  
<br>
<p>Yes, there were other vectors involved in the genesis of this  massive
<br>
jobs recession (the dotcom bust, Enron, loss of confidence in stocks,
<br>
Sept 9-11, etc.), but Bush -- in his quest for power--started the jobs
<br>
recession with his threats of an impending recession unless the
<br>
resolution (and the vote recount) was hurried .  If the
<br>
electoral/popular vote situation had been on the other shoe, I have no
<br>
doubt Gore would have done the same.
<br>
<p>Power corrupts, etc. When did we forget this?
<br>
<p>Just my ever-humble opinion....
