<em>&gt; Robert, just curious, but by preserve the 'death' meme, are you suggesting

</em><br>
<p>In *my* mind the only real &quot;salvation&quot; would appear to be uploading
<br>
and then some post-singularity clever tweeking of the physics of the
<br>
universe to avoid those paths that currently do not look good.
<br>
But I am *not* suggesting that in typical conversations that one get
<br>
into these concepts or the concepts of an &quot;afterlife&quot;.  If it facilitates
<br>
the evolutionary process, let people believe in an &quot;afterlife&quot;, let people
<br>
believe in &quot;death&quot;, and just move people up to the lifespan-extension bar.
<br>
(We are trying to be extropians here -- more people believing in some of
<br>
the core ideas is probably better than more people rejecting all of the
<br>
ideas.)
<br>
<p>I am simply suggesting that one not *break* existing memesets by suggesting
<br>
that &quot;immortality&quot; is possible to people who are unlikely to believe it --
<br>
because in its technical sense &quot;immortality&quot; is very very difficult to
<br>
achieve and probably cannot be &quot;proven&quot; using our current understanding
<br>
of physics and the hazard function of the universe, galaxies, solar systems,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Far better to leave people &quot;part of the way there&quot;, e.g. a healthy life
<br>
for a few hundred years or a few thousand years (depending on how much
<br>
their minds may stretch).  Because who knows what we may know at the
<br>
end of such periods?  People are much more comfortable extending trends
<br>
that their parents and grandparents saw (e.g. &quot;gradual lifespan extension
<br>
is accelerating&quot;) rather than replacing them with a very different meme
<br>
(e.g. &quot;we can become immortal&quot;).
<br>
<p>It makes it much easier to attack someone like Leon Kass, by asking
<br>
&quot;How much healthy life is 'enough'?&quot;  Should one be forced to die at
<br>
80, 90, 120, 150...?  Why not 30 (an average age of death in pre-Roman
<br>
times)?  The news today noted work on a controversial therapy for Parkinson's
<br>
using gene therapy.  Should we *not* attempt that?  The bioethicists that
<br>
oppose lifespan extension are on a very slippery slope.  But what would
<br>
be useful is to get more people on board with the idea that they can attend
<br>
the birthday parties of their great-great-great grandchildren.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks for clarifying this for me.  I hope I'm not asking a question that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been asked a hundred times before.
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe it as been discussed in detail before, certainly not
<br>
a hundred times.
<br>
