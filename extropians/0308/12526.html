<p>
My local newspaper printed an editorial disparaging to the PAM, though
<br>
it blamed Poindexter as the architect of it, innacurate as that is.
<br>
Here is a letter to the editor I just sent off to them:
<br>
<p>To the Editor,
<br>
I happen to know Robin Hanson personally. He is the fellow, an
<br>
assistant prof at George Mason University, who came up with the whole
<br>
idea behind the Pentagon's Policy Analysis Market, which you so snidely
<br>
call the &quot;Terror Futures Market&quot;. I also happen to have read quite a
<br>
few of his scholarly papers, so I believe I am far more informed than
<br>
you are to render judgement on the PAM as a means of predicting future
<br>
terrorist events.
<br>
It turns out that markets are far better at predicting future events
<br>
than intelligence services that governments run. Why? Because a market
<br>
turns every participant in it into an informer to the rest of the
<br>
market on what they know that may impact the market. This is a far
<br>
better intelligence gathering network than any government could ever
<br>
afford on its own.
<br>
Many liberal politicians that you editors admire think that the PAM is
<br>
&quot;morbid&quot;, &quot;sick&quot;, even &quot;evil&quot;, simply because it tries to reward people
<br>
for correctly predicting future events. Like some modern day Cassandra
<br>
(and I'll note that she wasn't popular in her day either), the PAM
<br>
would accurately predict events far better because it essentially
<br>
bribes terrorists, their associates, family members, and neighbors into
<br>
becoming informants to the rest of the world on their activities.
<br>
What I would like to know is, are investors in the PAM any LESS morbid
<br>
than you buying life insurance on your spouse's life? At least with the
<br>
PAM, only an attempt need be made for investors to win. Nobody HAS to
<br>
die. The PAM is intended to help prevent terrorist attacks.
<br>
For you to collect on your wive's insurance, she has to die. In this
<br>
respect, I'd say that you are far more morbid to buy life insurance on
<br>
a family member than to invest in the PAM. I think you owe an apology somewhere...
<br>
