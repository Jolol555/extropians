<br>
<p>private list governance.
<br>
<p>Greg,
<br>
<p>&quot;       I think you have just put your finger on the problem and also 
<br>
unknowingly shown that you do not understand what is going on.  Let me
<br>
attempt to explain it to you.
<br>
&quot;       In accounting and I suppose in law there is a concept of ownership.
<br>
<p>As you pointed out this list has owners -- no one to my knowledge disputes 
<br>
that.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
<br>
&quot;       Frankly, Mike seems to have been singled out for his specific 
<br>
political opinions.  If you don't agree I suggest you go back and read the
<br>
chortling that took place on this list when it was announced he was banned.
<br>
Only this time read the specifics of what was written.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is incorrect, Ron.  Mike share some of the some of the same political
<br>
leandings as many others on this list.  
<br>
<p>&quot;       On the other hand we have a blessed few on this list from the
<br>
idiotic wing of the left wing that are still as welcome as the flowers in
<br>
spring.&quot;
<br>
&quot;       Last, if you read the comments Natasha included in email it seems
<br>
to 
<br>
imply that Mike was only the first.  Who wants to live under that kind of 
<br>
threat?&quot;
<br>
<p>I said people have been unsubscribed in the past and might in the future. 
<br>
There is no threat. If people disregard list rules that will be enforced
<br>
now the new list moderators will deal with it promptly, rather than a slack
<br>
moderation that ignored peoples' complaints and dissatisfaction.
<br>
<p>Natasha
