<p>The problem with things like this is, they assume data
<br>
that's mostly been false, but is hard to disprove.
<br>
<p>For instance, stating that economically viable natural
<br>
gas deposits are mostly exhausted: such a claim has
<br>
been made before, yet new discoveries opened up - and
<br>
a slight increase in profit (higher price from
<br>
scarcity, lower cost from new tech, take your pick)
<br>
made more discoveries viable.  But how does someone
<br>
not in the oil industry (and thus suspect to having
<br>
made-up data themselves) disprove this?
<br>
<p>Or more simply: bluntly stating that wind and solar
<br>
can not, under any conditions, &quot;replace even a portion
<br>
of hydrocarbon energy&quot; - despite the fact that they
<br>
quite evidently have provided power that, had these
<br>
technologies never been invented, would come from
<br>
other sources, presumably including hydrocarbon
<br>
energy.
<br>
<p>I don't know how many times I've seen this argument
<br>
before.  I don't know how many times I'll see it
<br>
again.
<br>
<p>Still, there are some truths here, especially the bit
<br>
about transmission capability not being built.  Which
<br>
just argues more for home-ready sources of power, like
<br>
solar cells, that can be installed where the power
<br>
will be used.  (This can be in development, tax
<br>
credits, or other things that lessen the cost to the
<br>
end user.)  One of my 2050ish pipe dreams is for
<br>
helium-3 fusion, made possible in part by lunar
<br>
mining, to become economical for home use: a
<br>
completely automated fusion reactor capable of
<br>
powering a standard home, no larger or costlier than a
<br>
standard refrigerator, with enough fuel to last
<br>
several years between servicing.
