<p><em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; C'mon, if you think that any CEOs are going to the cellar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be shot, or marched up to guillotines, then you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; too far from reality.  Even if you are right about overpaid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; top executives, then the worst that will happen is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they'll be replaced by cheaper and more effective CEOs from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within the ranks, as the fad of outside celebrity wears off.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; No, I am sure that most of these selfish bastards will get off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scott-free,  no matter how crooked or conniving they have been,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how they, through their actions, have cheated the stockholders,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and are drying up the middle class. My point is that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive to US survival.
</em><br>
<p>Listen, they are NOWHERE near as bad as Jay Gould, Fisk, and
<br>
the rest of the 19th century swindlers.  Yet we survived that,
<br>
and even prospered.  Why?  Because for every one of them,
<br>
there was also a Commodore Vanderbilt and a Morgan.  The
<br>
bad guys do destroy wealth, and the Exxon types did too, but
<br>
it's not a big fraction of GNP.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rafal seems devoted to the nth degree in favor of free market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics. Though, I wonder what Milton Friedman looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is happening to Americans would concur with Rafal's zeal?
</em><br>
<p>My guess would be &quot;yes&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Right here, even the US is not really hurt by sending jobs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oversees where they can be done more cheaply and efficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because the American consumer is then so much better off.
</em><br>
<p>I wish to amend that statement to add the qualification
<br>
&quot;so long as Americans are willing to work rather than starve,
<br>
and so long as they're not voting themselves a dole.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is an inevitable cause and effect here, and if not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Newtonian, is mighty close. When goods and services by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American companies, or foreign imports become depressed;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because more and more Americans are out of work, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produces a deflationary economy, also known as a recession. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the unemployment rate was 25% in the Depression.
<br>
It's like 6% now, and a lot of those people have little
<br>
incentive to look for a job since they are on unemployment.
<br>
If you wish to understand economics, as so many people before
<br>
me have pointed out, look to people's incentives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If capital goes overseas, during a recession,
</em><br>
<p>This has been the mildest recession since WWII
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so that few jobs are produced, the economy stays moribund.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This hurts even people overseas, as demand they are dependent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, becomes so much less. I may purchase a Korean auto because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is cheaper;
</em><br>
<p>And if you have the money to spend, this increases your
<br>
wealth compared to paying for an overpriced one turned
<br>
out by unionized outmoded American shops...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but if I am broke and have to buy a used car, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will buy a clunker junker of any kind, to look for work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Far less people benefit from my purchase.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is not with your rational purchase, which
<br>
was selfish and commendable; the problem is with being
<br>
broke.  Why is one broke?  Either one is living beyond
<br>
one's means, or one refusing low paying jobs in the hopes
<br>
that the outlook for his profession will improve.  I can
<br>
talk: I lived a whole year in my car when I was not
<br>
employable, and six years in a tiny van, all the time
<br>
saving money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) I disagree the American economy is doing just fine.
</em><br>
<p>It could be better, but we must not wish for it to go
<br>
back to the late nineties when everyone merely *thought*
<br>
things were great.  In truth, wealth was being destroyed
<br>
at a colossal rate.  Bubbles are bad, and I bet the U.S.
<br>
gradually improves from where it is, but not a lot.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) If the middle class shrinks our economy will resemble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Argentina's which was going great-guns from the 19th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Great Depression, but disintegrated along with its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle class.
</em><br>
<p>I can tell you in two words what happened to Argentina, why
<br>
it was the 10th biggest economy in the *world* in 1900 and
<br>
how it became a basket case:  Juan Peron
<br>
<p>'Twas authoritarian socialism what killed the beast.
