<p>I couldn't stop laughing myself.  Nevertheless, I managed to google through
<br>
my giggles to come up with some insights into the working conditions in the
<br>
1800s and somewhat beyond:
<br>
<p>&quot;... From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, many young children in America
<br>
worked long hours in a variety of dangerous environments, such as
<br>
manufacturing and mining. Not only did they miss the opportunity to go to
<br>
school and receive an education, but some even lost their health and their
<br>
lives. It was because of these tragedies that U.S. child labor laws came
<br>
into effect.&quot;:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.njsbf.com/njsbf/student/eagle/spring01-1.cfm">http://www.njsbf.com/njsbf/student/eagle/spring01-1.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;With heavy labor came long hours and rarely did the pay increase despite
<br>
the grueling hours and often dangerous working environments. Over time,
<br>
Irish Americans banded together to organize unions and improve the working
<br>
conditions of all laborers. In 1879, Terence Powderly, a son of Irish
<br>
immigrants, was elected head of the Knights of Labor, a national association
<br>
of labor unions. Under his stewardship, it grew to include more than 700,000
<br>
members....
<br>
With the increase in numbers, the unions' ability to facilitate strikes and
<br>
boycotts posed a real threat to industries. Soon negotiations were taking
<br>
place and the working conditions for U.S. laborers began to improve
<br>
dramatically.&quot;:

<br>
<p>&quot;The mistreatment of child workers is not just a foreign problem. Since
<br>
colonial times, the U.S. has counted on children to lend a helping hand in
<br>
its fields and factories. In the 1800s, children as young as 7 worked in
<br>
textile mills for 12 hours a day. Bad behavior sent a child straight to the
<br>
'whipping room' for punishment.
<br>
<p>In 1938 a federal law was passed that set child-labor guidelines, limiting
<br>
work hours for kids and requiring safe conditions.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;Throughout the 1800s, women began to enter industry in large numbers. Their
<br>
jobs were primarily sex-segregated with most working in textiles,
<br>
manufacturing, and domestic services. These women worked in extremely
<br>
unhealthy, dangerous conditions for wages even worse than for their male
<br>
counterparts. In this climate, it was women who bore the triple burden of
<br>
exploitation by the factory owners, of having no voice in the government,
<br>
and of the attacks by many male workers and sexist unions that feared the
<br>
competition women represented. It was Lucy Parsons, the radical multi-racial
<br>
anarcho-feminist, who summed up the condition of women in the six simple
<br>
words: &quot;'We are the slaves of slaves.'&quot; :

<br>
<p>You get the picture.  There's a *ton* of information about working
<br>
conditions (or working restrictions) in the USA during the 19th century.  Go
<br>
ahead - anybody - defend them if you can.
<br>
<p>I say, Lee, what you wrote (in the sentence that began: &quot;Like in 1830, the
<br>
boss might come in one day and say...&quot;) put you in Wishfulthinkingland
<br>
(cousin of Neverneverland), and maybe Peter Pan can fly there, as well ...
<br>
but your example doesn't.
