<p>There are particular causes that are more important to me than avoiding death.  
<br>
But I do not believe there is any valid excuse for genocide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you may have a moral imperative to die.  It may be the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible thing you could do - to actually be brave.  There certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are prima facie obvious cases where bravery would demand self-sacrifice

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to decide whether to make a world in which people live forever or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which they die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Putting off or not pursuing the ability of people to live forever because one 
<br>
is afraid of losing a certain type of physical bravery in the face of death 
<br>
is ridiculous.   One can still be brave in a world where the default is to 
<br>
live indefinitely long.  There are many, many forms of bravery, most of which 
<br>
are much preferable to charging into certain death for the 
<br>
physical/emotional/adrenalized/solemn glory of it all.   Just because one has 
<br>
the means to live forever doesn't mean that nothing can come up where one's 
<br>
more or less infinite life is forfeit to an important enough value.  
<br>
<p>I submit it takes a bravery of high order to step beyond the deathist thinking 
<br>
and all that proceeds from it and actually seek and end to mandatory aging 
<br>
and death and actually seek out and live all the internal and external 
<br>
changes necessary to make it real.  It takes a high order of bravery to face 
<br>
life and continued responsibility, creativity, and living of it indefinitely.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you think it's sophistry, try to rewrite human morality without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bravery and say genuinely to yourself that you want to want THAT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your argument is spurious for the above reasons, because bravery is orthogonal 
<br>
to immortality and because bravery is not even a primary human virtue.   I 
<br>
would be quite happy to rewrite human morality to remove many of the inane 
<br>
things we call brave which are actually adrenalized mass stupidity.
