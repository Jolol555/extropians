<p>Ah, I was about to post this.

<p>The article mentions peanuts as another source, although I don't know how to
<br>
find stressed peanuts.  I think polyphenols are also in green tea.
<br>
<p>A year ago I was heavily into _The Okinawa Program_, and its claims that
<br>
Okinawans were the only properly documented population of long-lived people,
<br>
thanks to Japan's bureaucracy.  An article I read recently -- I forget in
<br>
what, unfortunately -- listed Okinawa as yet another in a list of failed
<br>
claims (like the Caucasus.) and was claiming Sicily or Sardinia as the new
<br>
aging grail.   Does anyone know anything more definitive about this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this is like masturbation to reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

</em><br>
<p>That was nice.  I'd worried about the reverse, that asking the
<br>
sperm-generators to divide and produce too often would cause prostate cancer.
