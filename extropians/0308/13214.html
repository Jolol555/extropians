<p>Yes. In this context, I'll post below (for discussion) a very slightly
<br>
modified version of an essay on the feasibility and desirability of direct
<br>
democracy, written in 1966 when I was more an elitist than I am today. I've
<br>
modified it slightly to take account of the reality of the Internet, which
<br>
I invoked as a futuristic possibility (`the Zeitgeist machine'), and some
<br>
other small details. My neuroscience was sketchy nearly 40 years ago, but I
<br>
believe still stands up in general terms. I start the piece with a long
<br>
quote from a Heinlein novella that I found creepy but compelling, and still
<br>
do.
<br>
<p>This must be regarded as an unfinished project. I no longer subscribe to
<br>
the flourishing 1966 ending, where I said (smartarse that I was, and
<br>
quoting a friend's quip) that perhaps Plato was right in supposing that
<br>
what the people wanted was `a fuck, a feed, and a Fuehrer'.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We defined thinking as the ability to recognize data, store them,
<br>
integrate them, evaluate correctly the result and arrive at a correct
<br>
answer. Look around you. Most people do that stunt just well enough to get
<br>
to the corner store and back without breaking a leg. If the average man
<br>
thinks at all, he does silly things like generalizing from a single datum.
<br>
He uses one--valued logics. If he is exceptionally bright, he may use
<br>
two-valued, `either--or' logic to arrive at his wrong answers. If he is
<br>
hungry, hurt, or personally interested in the answer, he can't use any sort
<br>
of logic and will discard an observed fact as blithely as he will stake his
<br>
life on a piece of wishful thinking. He uses the technical miracles created
<br>
by superior men without wonder or surprise, as a kitten accepts a bowl of
<br>
milk. Far from aspiring to higher reasoning he is not even aware that
<br>
higher reasoning exists. He classes his own mental process as being of the
<br>
same sort as the genius of an Einstein. Man is not a rational animal; he is
<br>
a rationalizing animal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For explanations of a universe that confuses him he seizes onto
<br>
numerology, astrology, hysterical religions, and other fancy ways to go
<br>
crazy. Having accepted such glorified nonsense, facts make no impression on
<br>
him, even if at the cost of his own life. Joe, one of the hardest things to
<br>
believe is the abysmal depth of human stupidity.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The idea is to skim the cream of the race's germ plasm and keep it
<br>
biologically separate until the two races are permanently distinct? You
<br>
chaps sound like a bunch of stinkers, Baldwin!'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Monkey talk.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Perhaps. The new race would necessarily run things-'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Do you expect New Man to decide grave matters by counting common man's
<br>
runny noses?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No, that was my point. Postulating such a new race, the result is
<br>
inevitable. Baldwin, I confess to a monkey prejudice in favor of democracy,
<br>
human dignity, and freedom. It goes beyond logic; it is the kind of a world
<br>
I like. In my job I have mingled with the outcasts of society, shared their
<br>
slum-gullion. Stupid they may be, bad they are not-I have no wish to see
<br>
them become domestic animals.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time the big man showed concern. His persona slipped away;
<br>
he sat in brooding majesty, a lonely and unhappy figure. `I know, Joe. They
<br>
are of us; their little dignities, their nobilities, are not lessened by
<br>
their sorry state. Yet it must be...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I confess to that same affection for democracy, Joe. But it's like
<br>
yearning for the Santa Claus you believed in as a child. For a hundred and
<br>
fifty years or so democracy, or something like it, could flourish safely.
<br>
The issues were such as could be settled without disaster by the votes of
<br>
common men, befogged and ignorant as they were. But now, if the race is
<br>
simply to stay alive, political decisions depend on real knowledge of such
<br>
things as nuclear physics, planetary ecology, genetic theory, even system
<br>
mechanics. They aren't up to it, Joe. With goodness and more will than they
<br>
possess less than one in a thousand could stay awake over one page of
<br>
nuclear physics; they can't learn what they must know.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilead brushed it aside. `It's up to us to brief them. Their hearts are
<br>
all right; tell them the score-they'll come down with the right answers.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No, Joe. We've tried it; it does not work. As you say, most of them are
<br>
good. Yet there are bad ones. Reason is poor propaganda when opposed by the
<br>
yammering, unceasing lies of shrewd and evil and self-serving men. The
<br>
little man has no way to judge and the shoddy lies are packaged more
<br>
attractively. There is no way to offer color to a colorblind man, nor is
<br>
there any way for us to give the man of imperfect brain the canny skill to
<br>
distinguish a lie from a truth.'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilead's brain followed Baldwin's argument and assured him that it was
<br>
true; his inclinations fought it. He was confronted with the sharpest of
<br>
all tragedy: two equally noble and valid rights, bitterly opposed...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulf, Robert A. Hein1ein
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II
<br>
<p>Government is one of the primary operational meta-structures of a complex
<br>
community. By `structure' I mean the network of roles that determine and
<br>
circumscribe the activities and relationships of individuals who comprise
<br>
the community.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In simple societies, structure is generally derived from kinship and the
<br>
specialized kinds of craft skills and secret traditional knowledge that
<br>
people pass down from father or uncle to son, mother or aunt to daughter.
<br>
Structure is all; there is no need for meta-structure. In modern societies,
<br>
such simple structures become disrupted by mobility. Custom loses its
<br>
invariance. Anomie replaces order and expectation. Systems of communication
<br>
and control must be devised instead of found in some natural, traditional
<br>
order of things. Painfully, meta-structure comes into being. `Trouble
<br>
starts (governments). Their existence testifies to the fact that the
<br>
elementary and almost instinctive ways in which men ordinarily arrange
<br>
their joint affairs have broken down.'1
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So government is the mechanism through which conscious adaptive control
<br>
and co-ordination can be exercised in a de-tribalised community. Democracy
<br>
is the species of that genus `founded in the free responsiveness of the
<br>
state to the community'.2 Democratic institutions provide direct feedback
<br>
between the controlled and the controllers, ultimately and importantly
<br>
exemplified in the communal option to elect or depose the governmental
<br>
executives.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct democracy  is the actual legislative formulation by the full body
<br>
of the citizenry, which decides by referendum what, when and how measures
<br>
shall be put into practice. James Madison, in the Federalist, used
<br>
`democracy' in this way, distinguishing it from `republic' or popular
<br>
representative government. It has been distinguished from `psephocracy'3
<br>
(rule via the ballot box), a synonym for republicanism which emphasizes the
<br>
wide gap separating contemporary `democracy' from direct, hands-on democracy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psephocracy is a retreat from decision, from responsibility, from debate,
<br>
from self-direction. It boasts the forms of republicanism but, lacking the
<br>
substance, rarely employs them. Oligopolistic mass-media emasculate the
<br>
habit of free discussion not merely by censoring information but by
<br>
providing a simulacrum of open debate. Inflated xenophobia and patriotism
<br>
can swamp the educated habit-of-truth by presenting dissent as dangerously
<br>
close to treason.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In fact, the accepted view is that those who try, by pressure and
<br>
agitation, to prevent the government from taking actions which they
<br>
consider wrong are infringing the rules of the system and going back on an
<br>
implicit bargain. Their proper course is to keep quiet and vote the other
<br>
way when the chance comes round.'4 And the same pressures act, very
<br>
often-even in polities where elections do provide a real alternative-to
<br>
render the citizenry psychologically incapable of making that real choice.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedurally, direct democracy differs from psephocracy in its frequent
<br>
consultation with the voters; psychologically, elitist objections to rule
<br>
by the people applies even more strongly. One would expect that at least
<br>
some decisions made by referendum would not be identical with those reached
<br>
after a debate of `representatives'. Nonetheless, there is no reason to
<br>
suspect that a vote decided by a majority of media--befogged citizens of
<br>
average intelligence would be more rational than one decided by
<br>
(presumably) more intelligent, party-bound `representatives' reflecting
<br>
sectional interests. It might be more popular, but so was bread and circus.
<br>
Is rationality a desideratum? If government is the mechanism of control and
<br>
co-ordination, it must primarily be a rational process; otherwise,
<br>
democracy becomes the apotheosis of the majority's whim-more properly,
<br>
ochlocracy, or mob rule.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been urged that, it is futile discussing such a system in the
<br>
modern context, whatever the merits or demerits of direct democracy.5
<br>
Granted, the Swiss Confederation allows veto of constitutional proposals,
<br>
laws and treaties, and permits by popular resort to the initiative the
<br>
introduction and approval of constitutional amendments. Yet, `whatever
<br>
value we may set on the unique Swiss system, it is certainly far removed
<br>
from the turbulent direct democracy of the Ancient Greeks.'6 Moreover, it
<br>
is often declared, such a procedure would be cumbersome and slow,
<br>
impossible in a dispersed technological society.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet and mass communications are now sufficiently advanced,
<br>
however, to solve the technical aspects of such difficulties. What is of
<br>
greater concern than its empirical feasibility are the implications for the
<br>
human condition if computerized direct democracy were introduced.
<br>
Intelligence, sheer neuralogical capacity to assimilate and order data, and
<br>
creativity, the blend of brain and environmental which generates new
<br>
hypotheses, important as they are in this context, are by no means the
<br>
whole reason why direct democracy does not yet seem a terribly good idea.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III
<br>
<p>Laid down by John Stuart Mill, the ethical foundations of democratic
<br>
theory, are predicated on the moral dignity of humans as rational and
<br>
volitional beings. Mill's wonderful statement on tolerance7 leads directly
<br>
to the view which `defines liberty as an attribute of societies which
<br>
tolerate and facilitate peaceful reassessments and reforms.'8 In Ernest
<br>
Gellner's words: `Certainty enters only as a negative epistemological
<br>
thesis.'9
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mill's faith `in the moral value of democracy was combined, however with
<br>
an acute awareness of the practical dangers implicit in mass action... His
<br>
great fear of the masses was that they would use their power to discourage
<br>
or prohibit uncommon lines of thought and action, forcing everyone to
<br>
conform to a common standard of popular mediocrity.'10 To avoid imposed
<br>
conformity, he proposed that democracy be postponed while `under the
<br>
tutelage of a liberal-minded minority, the masses could slowly acquire the
<br>
various skills needed for effective citizenship. As their education
<br>
progressed, their political responsibilities would increase in like
<br>
proportion.'11 Yet Mill felt that even when this had been achieved, the
<br>
best form of democracy would be represent-ative government.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would have agreed that democracy was the system of rule founded in the
<br>
free responsiveness of the state to the community-but only if that
<br>
community was educated and liberal, which on the whole would elect able and
<br>
rational representatives. Has that been the experience of the past century
<br>
and a half? One might doubt it, by and large.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright, brave dreams even of sober optimists like Mill lie often
<br>
flayed and broken on the threshing-floor of history.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV
<br>
<p>Perhaps a valediction to democracy is premature. Perhaps the dubious
<br>
triumph of psephocracy is merely a phase in the education to democracy, an
<br>
affluent adolescent extravaganza of complacency, as the Soviets use to
<br>
suggest the harsh communism of Stalin was in the long road to the withering
<br>
of the state. I'll tell you why I don't think so.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob Bronowski, in Science and Human Values, brilliantly and plausibly
<br>
demonstrated how the liberal, humane values of truthfulness, justice,
<br>
respect, independence, tolerance are generated as the necessary conditions
<br>
for the practise of science or any form of creative endeavor. When the
<br>
Hobbesian seeks to justify these virtues, it must be for their expedience
<br>
in the general self-interest. It is possible to do this-indeed, A. S.
<br>
Neill's remarkable successes in rehabilitating delinquents at Summerhill
<br>
showed how other-regarding values can be learned pragmatically-but these
<br>
are not the only values expedience can find. History is largely the record
<br>
of how human beings discovered the value of deceit, obsequience, brutality
<br>
and contempt. Laziness prospers well in psephocracy, and psephocrats
<br>
prosper because of it, as tyrants once prospered because of terror and in
<br>
some places still do.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a moral evaluation. Liberal (pluralist) values, on which
<br>
democracy of any kind and direct democracy in particular must rest, are an
<br>
interior necessity only to certain people. The politician whose
<br>
temperamental bent and inner drives are to power and its indulgence-rather
<br>
than to scientific, creative, philosophic curiosity and its indulgence-may
<br>
subscribe to liberal values only so long as they do not interfere with his
<br>
will-to-power. Humanist values are not necessary to the exercise of power,
<br>
as they are to curious and invention-or if they are, it is not obviously
<br>
so. Similarly, a neurotic introvert may prefer the values of
<br>
self-abasement, masochism and treachery to a truth-seeker's sine qua non
<br>
moral values.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human organism can be described as an input-processing-output system,
<br>
incorporating a hierarchy of cortical feedback loops that largely accounts
<br>
for reflectivity and thence self-conscious identity. Data input
<br>
(exteroceptive, proprioceptive and cognitive) is mapped on to associational
<br>
matrices or attractors. These matrices are largely phylogenetic, inherited
<br>
in prer-shaped form fro  our evolutionary ancestors. However, there is
<br>
comparatively great flexibility in the higher morphogenetic frameworks
<br>
(perceptual abstractions such as the visual constancies are innate, but can
<br>
be interfered with, `from above', by verbal suggestion), and the
<br>
cognitive/emotive matrices are enormously variable. These latter `human'
<br>
nets of data-response patterns are roughly what we call concepts. And the
<br>
larger matrix which subsumes an individual's concepts we might term his or
<br>
her `phenomenological mode'.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All autonomic modes and, less directly, all phenomenological modes stem
<br>
from the individual's unique neurobiochemical organization. At its
<br>
simplest, think of somatotype, a classification of body shape introduced by
<br>
William Sheldon in 1940: thin nervy ectomorphs, muscular confident
<br>
mesomorphs, corpulent endomorphs. More significant, and not unrelated to
<br>
somatotypy, is the degree of inhibition or facilitation of afferent
<br>
impulses by the nervous system's ascending reticular formation. Evidence
<br>
suggests that this inhibition or facilitation is closely connected to the
<br>
individual's position in the behavioral continuum from extravert to
<br>
introvert. The extreme extravert is typically muscular, with high
<br>
inhibition of afferent or incoming nervous impulses, hence stimulus hungry.
<br>
The extreme introvert is thin, cerebrotonic, with high facilitation of
<br>
input, hence stimulus sensitive. The population mean, in America, is
<br>
shifted well towards the former classification.12
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behaviorally, a culture's tempo takes a mean or average value, at neither
<br>
one extreme nor the other. Consequently, extraverts tend to experience
<br>
`stimulus starvation', so they act more boistrously to drive up the volume.
<br>
Moreover, central inhibition impedes conditioning; since social mores are
<br>
in large part culturally conditioned, extraverts can satisfy their stimulus
<br>
hunger with less concern than average for the law. Extreme extraverts do
<br>
seem to make up a large percentage of the prison-populations in Australia
<br>
and America.13 Introverts, on the other hand, receive a stimulus battering
<br>
in the normal context; they may respond by withdrawal and some can become
<br>
neurotic and even suicidal. Being readily conditioned, they are likely to
<br>
be `moral', although extreme introverts, being especially sensitive to
<br>
their deviation from the norm, are prone to alien-ation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might divide contemporary phenomenological modality, very roughly, into
<br>
three very broad categories. Two of these were made famous in the middle of
<br>
the 20th century by sociologist David Riesman, in his surprisingly
<br>
bestselling The Lonely Crowd: A Study of the Changing American Character
<br>
(Yale University Press, 1950), which added a `tradition-directed' mode
<br>
typical of pre-industrial cultures.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) The `other-directed' or conformist mode: `I am in that others respond
<br>
to me, recognize me, approve of me'.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) The `inner-directed' self-driven mode: `I am in that I recognize
<br>
myself'-identity is mediated less directly than in (A), via an internalized
<br>
other-directed structure: the second `I' or the inner-directed paradigm
<br>
being the Word, the a priori, the Imposed Conscience or superego.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) The `scientific' mode, not described by Riesman. This is less
<br>
precarious and more independent than `other-directedness', for here what is
<br>
given is the scientific methodology and its canon; or in the case of some
<br>
artists, the relevant artistic tradition and command of expertise. It is
<br>
also more flexible than pure `inner-directedness', with constant reference
<br>
to an other, the empirical facts. Nor does it closely resemble
<br>
pre-industrial `tradition-centredness', since its traditions and framing
<br>
theories continually modify any provisional constructs and certainties. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) seems congenial to, and perhaps somewhat predicated upon, extraversion
<br>
morphology, (B) to introversion, while (C) would seem to be more common
<br>
among less-extreme intro-verts, and perhaps approximates to the INTJ and
<br>
ENTJ temperaments on the Myers-Briggs scale. A study now half a century old
<br>
`has indeed shown that, as a profession, science attracts men whose
<br>
temperament is grave, awkward, and absorbed.'14 `There is one vital field
<br>
where scientists have made hardly any contribution,' Physics Nobel laureate
<br>
I. I. Rabi remarked decades ago, `and that is to politics-politics in its
<br>
practical sense of standing for office. Somehow the scientific education
<br>
diminishes the ambition for power and worldly influence.'15 I think it much
<br>
more likely that the motivational drives of the scientific modality make
<br>
the enterprise of personal satisfaction of curiosity far more appealing
<br>
than public affairs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If then, as Bronowski suggested, many key humane values are generated out
<br>
of the scientific mode as a necessary condition for its operation, what of
<br>
democracy? Ironically, democratic theorists have tended to share this
<br>
phenomenological mode with scientists, so the values they found
<br>
self-evident by introspection were quite naturally assumed to be latent in
<br>
everyone, hidden by a condition nasty, brutish and short. If this analysis
<br>
has any validity, we must recognize that the larger part of contemporary
<br>
western communities is morphogenetically other-directed, compliant and
<br>
complacently hedonistic. It might seem, then, that the immense task of
<br>
developing a truly humane, open and tolerant society cannot be entrusted to
<br>
most people's innate rationality and good will. Will-to-rationality and
<br>
open-minded tolerance might be nearly as rare (INTJs comprise perhaps 5
<br>
percent of the population) as superior intelligence (the top few
<br>
percentiles of IQ measures).
