<em>&gt; &gt; That may be, but how much more malice is generated through honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mistakes?  Its natural to think that if someone does something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that harms us that harm must have been their intent (and I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eliezer can give a better description than me as to why), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the complex world we live in its hard to judge the impact of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our actions on everyone they effect, even if we do try.  When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone stupidly argues for/against the war with Iraq, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immigration your opponent is probably not out to destroy America,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and it pays to remember this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the primary reason why I think people should be judged on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of their actions, instead of their motivations.  Since we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can never truly know someone's motivations, but we can much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectively determine the consequences of their actions.  Besides, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely unclear whether (good intentions) + (ignorance) has caused more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm in the world or (evil intentions) + (intelligence) has.  Those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commit ills with their good intentions + ignorance are never encumbered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by such nuisances as a guilty conscience.  Witness the banning of DDT,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done with entirely good intentions, has now lead to the death of more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 20 million people, mostly children in Africa, which otherwise would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have died.  At the height of DDT spraying deaths from malaria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbered in the single to low double digits every year.  Now they number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the millions.

<p>I agree that stupidity has probably cause far, far more human suffering
<br>
than malevolence, especially since its so much more common.  However, the
<br>
best methods of responding to stupidity is very differnet from the best
<br>
method of responding to malevolence.
<br>
<p>If the DDT opponents had caused the spraying to stop with the express
<br>
purpose of causing all those deaths, we could punish them in some way so
<br>
as to deter other people from acting in such a horrible way.  On the other
<br>
hand, knowing that they would be punished for the wrong decision wouldn't
<br>
have affected the actions of a DDT opponent who sincerely beleived that
<br>
they were doing the right thing.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, a malicious person with a sufficient threat hanging
<br>
over their head can be persuaded to act well, but a stupid person won't
<br>
improve in this way.  This makes it important to recognize which your
<br>
dealing with, and given that the normal human bias is to attribute actions
<br>
to bad will, thus my signature (which isn't stored on this particular
<br>
computer, unfortunatly.)
