[Having (hopefully) resolved the chronic email problems I've been having all
<br>
summer, I'm back to more regular posting.]

</em><br>
<p>I try to stay out of discussions of contemporary partisan politics on this
<br>
list, because I think they have only limited relevance and it's extremely
<br>
hard to manage the risk that they will spiral out of control into
<br>
personalistic flame wars.  But I feel compelled to speak up here.  I will
<br>
*NOT* engage in any kind of tit-for-tat discussion or argument about the
<br>
subject of this thread, but I feel the need to note my distaste for the
<br>
original message in this thread and the tone of posts like this.
<br>
<p>I've worked in the legal system of the United States every day for the last
<br>
19 years.  I've also studied the rise of fascism and other totalitarian
<br>
systems in the 20th century as a major personal interest for over 30 years.
<br>
With that base of experience and knowledge, I find that likening the Bush
<br>
administration to Nazis utterly *absurd*.  Yes, there have been some
<br>
curtailments of civil liberties in some very, very few cases that have an
<br>
arguable connection to *foreign* terrorism.  That I know of, there have been
<br>
no real curtailments of civil liberties in wholly domestic cases.  None.
<br>
Might the cases involving suspected foreign terrorist activity be the first
<br>
trickle in some kind of tide that would roll back the main body of civil
<br>
liberties in the United States?  I personally doubt it very seriously,
<br>
although I'm glad they are taken seriously.  But they bear no resemblance to
<br>
the kind of wholesale destruction of civil liberties that accompanied the
<br>
rise of real totalitarianism to which this post makes a comparison.  Thus I
<br>
feel that calling the Bush administration &quot;Die Neue Reichstadt&quot; baseless.
<br>
<p>Simply because it's been done to death here and serves no useful purpose *on
<br>
this list*, I won't address the points about U.S. foreign military activity.
