<p>
I just have a few comments about the recent expulsions and exits of the 
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>Somehow this is a very personal issue, but I really don't feel 
<br>
comfortable about discussing personal issues as it very easy becomes ad 
<br>
hominem. So I will try to keep it general.
<br>
<p><p>As far as I can see, the problem with certain posters is not their 
<br>
political views. One side or the other.
<br>
<p>The problem has allways been about skewing the direction of the list.
<br>
<p>There is an infinite amount of subjects that can be discussed on a 
<br>
mailing list. But for it to be an Extropian mailing list, the subjects 
<br>
need some kind of extropian content.
<br>
<p>Some subjetcs are clearly extropian some are clearly not extropian. And 
<br>
in between are subjects that are only sligtly extropian.
<br>
<p>Some of these &quot;fringe&quot; subjects are of great interrest to some extropians.
<br>
<p>As far as I see, some posters has a tendency to skew the comments they 
<br>
read, and lead them in the direction of their special interrest. So they 
<br>
reply to a posting on another subject and make it into a thread about 
<br>
their favourite subject.
<br>
<p>Sort of &quot;If you got a hammer everything looks like a nail.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also they have a tendency to reply more often to other postings in these 
<br>
their favourite subject areas.
<br>
<p>This has the effect that they kind of hi-jack the list and make it into 
<br>
a kind of special interrest group for something that is only slightly 
<br>
extropian.
<br>
<p>So the list gets skewed.
<br>
<p>And it is hard to put a finger on exactly what the problem is, as the 
<br>
subjects are somewhat extropian. But their &quot;fringenes&quot; and the amount of 
<br>
skewed subjects makes it into a general problem for the list.
<br>
<p>Wich makes other people on the list frustrated.
<br>
<p>Personally I saved several months of messages in an inbox. Then I sorted 
<br>
them by sender and evaluated who had made to many skewed postings in 
<br>
those months. My mailfilter then puts them into a special folder that i 
<br>
only view occationally.
<br>
<p>The funny thing is that there was many entire threads that ended up in 
<br>
my &quot;fringe&quot; folder. Because some &quot;groups&quot; mostly comunicated with each 
<br>
other about the fringe subjects.
<br>
<p>But I don't think that is the best solution. The fringe subjects DO 
<br>
belong on the list, just not in the volume that it can sometime be.
<br>
<p>So I am all in favour of list moderation to keep the discussions in the 
<br>
center of the gaussian normal distribution of relevant subjects.
<br>
