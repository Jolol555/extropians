<p>We are all still humans.  Espousing TransHumanism doesn't make one a 
<br>
trans-human.  So don't be surprised that normal human politics it the 
<br>
actual reaction pattern even among those who promote other patterns as 
<br>
preferable.  And when the rules are vague and subjective, then those 
<br>
making the decisions will be greatly influenced by their own emotions. 
<br>
Will be, not may be.  In that situation there *is* not alternative.
<br>
<p>I don't trust any centralized authority run by people, because over and 
<br>
over again people have proven untrustworthy.  But I do trust traffic 
<br>
signals.  They only play the favorites that they are designed to play 
<br>
(e.g., emergency vehicles, or timed signals).
<br>
<p>OTOH, I don't trust voting machines.  Consider the reasons:
<br>
1) how they work is hidden.
<br>
2) there have already been instances where they were appearantly corrupted.
<br>
3) reputable authorities have stated publically that they don't have 
<br>
good safeguards against being corrupted.
<br>
4) Influencing the vote so that your client wins has a tremendously high 
<br>
payoff.
<br>
But do you really think that the prior elections were without 
<br>
corruption?  Even after the last one, where several different modes of 
<br>
corrupting the vote became public knowledge?
<br>
<p>Centralized authority is an inherrent weakness when the authority can 
<br>
benefit from misusing it's power.  It's an evolutionary process, and if 
<br>
you don't consider the likely mutations, you can't predict the end 
<br>
result, but it won't be what you wanted.
