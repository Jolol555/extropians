Open Access to Scientific Research
<br>
<p>August 7, 2003
<br>
<p><p>A number of influential scientists have begun to argue that
<br>
the cost of research publications has grown so large that
<br>
it impedes the distribution of knowledge. Some
<br>
subscriptions cost thousands of dollars per year, and those
<br>
journals are usually available online only to subscribers.
<br>
This looks less like dissemination than restriction,
<br>
especially if it is measured against the potential access
<br>
offered by the Internet. That is why a coalition led by Dr.
<br>
Harold Varmus, the former director of the National
<br>
Institutes of Health, is creating a new model, called the
<br>
Public Library of Science.
<br>
<p>Several years ago Dr. Varmus's group issued an open letter,
<br>
signed by some 30,000 colleagues, calling on the publishers
<br>
of scientific journals to make their archived research
<br>
articles freely available online. Most journals declined,
<br>
so they would not undercut the profitable business of
<br>
selling expensive subscriptions to libraries. But there is
<br>
a basic inequity when much of the research has been
<br>
financed by public money.
<br>
<p>The Public Library of Science plans to confront that
<br>
inequity by establishing a new series of peer-reviewed
<br>
journals that will be freely available on the Internet. The
<br>
first ones, published this October, will be PLoS Biology
<br>
and PLoS Medicine. The aim is to create a freer flow of
<br>
data about research and results. The journals will pay for
<br>
themselves by charging a small fee to the organizations and
<br>
institutions that support the research.
<br>
<p>Most of us, admittedly, will not have much use for free
<br>
access to new discoveries in, say, particle physics. But it
<br>
is a different matter when it comes to medical research.
<br>
Popular nostrums abound on the Web, but it can be very
<br>
hard, if not impossible, to find the results of properly
<br>
vetted, taxpayer-financed science - and in some cases it
<br>
can be hard for your doctor to find them, too. The Public
<br>
Library of Science could help change all that, creating
<br>
open access to research. The publishers of scientific
<br>
journals are naturally skeptical, but the real test will
<br>
come in the marketplace of ideas. What will matter this
<br>
fall, when the new journals make their debut, is how many
<br>
scientists choose to publish in them rather than in the
<br>
journals traditionally deemed the most prestigious in their
<br>
disciplines.
