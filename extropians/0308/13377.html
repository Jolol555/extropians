<em>&gt; In all the discussion of alternate and renewable

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the discussion that I have seen, the assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the price of electricity must remain nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant.  Do think about this however.  Energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplies may be controlled by allowing the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of power at any given time to float to whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels necessary to reduce demand.  On sunny,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blowy days, the actual price of energy might fall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to practically nothing, whereas it might be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive on dark still days, when the power would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be supplied by expensive peaker plants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By insisting that power prices be nearly constant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *we all pay more* since peaker plants are costly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to operate and produce very pricy power part time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the market mandates to be sold at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price as non-peak power, and the supply must always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient to cover the demand.  Result:  everyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total power bill is higher than they would be if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would collectively tolerate wildly fluctuating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices and occasional shortages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If power were to be sold at the real-time price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it costs to make it, then the proletariat would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjust its collective behavior, charging batteries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when power is cheap, and turning off the air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditioners when power is expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I stayed on a farm in Aussi that once that worked on a primitive variant on
<br>
this idea. Power was cheaper at night so our friend had a big electric
<br>
hotwater heater that would heat at night and then &quot;coast&quot; all day. As a city
<br>
slicker it was a bit inconvenient to have to get up early to shower, but for
<br>
farmers getting up early was no problem (besides which, showers are hardly
<br>
de rigueur for farmers).
<br>
<p>One way to handle this would be to have your computer manage your
<br>
electricity consumption. You could then say to your computer, &quot;It would be
<br>
good if the dishes were done by tomorrow morning but they must be done by
<br>
tomorrow night, unless power is above .30kwh. The voice recognition software
<br>
would then translate your preferences and figure out when to run the
<br>
dishwasher. The computer could monitor the price of electricity on the net
<br>
as well as the &quot;electricity forecast&quot;--projected cost of electricity for the
<br>
next few days. Similarly it could switch on your washing machine, dryer, and
<br>
charge your electric vehicle in nonpeak times (when prices are lower). Like
<br>
my Aussi friend, there would be incentive to use fairly low tech means to
<br>
&quot;coast&quot; as well. Extra large water tanks that might take advantage of cheap
<br>
rates. Another low tech possibility would be to use your airconditioner to
<br>
cool say a 1000 gallon tank of water in your basement when rates are cheap.
<br>
When rates go up you take advantage of the cold water to cool the house for
<br>
a few hours. Freezers set a few degrees cooler could also coast through peak
<br>
times. Such a system seems a natural for renewables which tend to be more
<br>
cyclical than conventional means of generating electricity. Being a bleeding
<br>
heart, I would like to see some provision for making sure that the
<br>
electricity providers don't act like an oligopoly. In the long run this
<br>
should be obviated when there are more electricity suppliers, e.g., where
<br>
homes and business are covered with solar cells.
