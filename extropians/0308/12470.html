<em>&gt; [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20thinking%20about%20the%20unthinkable">owner-extropians@extropy.org</a>]On Behalf Of Damien Broderick

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because my sharp and immediate reaction to Robert Bradbury's `abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration' of a `horrific suggestion' was the first off the block, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been deplored in strong terms by Lee Corbin as nothing better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullying, I should perhaps write a little more about that.
</em><br>
<p>This is not so an unfair characterization of my charge as I
<br>
had thought.  &quot;Bullying&quot; can include (1) cruelty (2) lording
<br>
power over others.  I certainly was not accusing you of that.
<br>
<p>But I have learned that in many instances the term need not
<br>
connote that, so as long as neither of these is meant, then
<br>
yes, that is my accusation.  But a much better description
<br>
is that scolding in high dudgeon and moral rage/self-
<br>
righteousness, though it can be an honest reaction, is
<br>
not at all helpful.  We all really  should make an effort
<br>
to---however angry we are---restrain ourselves to rational
<br>
communication.
<br>
<p>Because as I said before, one of the components in angry
<br>
attacks on posters is:  Be Afraid.
<br>
<p>Because not only are one's ideas being criticized, but so
<br>
is one's very character itself.  
<br>
<p>Now of course, inferences about someone's character are
<br>
always bound to be made, and no one can really stop
<br>
himself or herself from doing so privately.  For example,
<br>
to some for a person to admit to atheism necessarily
<br>
reveals a personal character defect of no small proportion.
<br>
To others, for someone to advocate adult/child sex or
<br>
blatant child molestation will reflect very negatively
<br>
on the advocate's character.
<br>
<p>But this is quite different from attempting to *intimidate*
<br>
the advocates of atheism or child molestation, or uploading,
<br>
or whatever else is the criticized project or activity, by
<br>
attacking the speaker's moral virtue.  Let their advocacy
<br>
of an idea speak for itself!  Please allow them to be condemned
<br>
---if that is what it is to be in your mind and the minds of
<br>
others---by their own words.
<br>
<p>Speakers on a forum such as this, where the currency is in
<br>
ideas, ought not to have to suffer personal attacks, or have
<br>
their character besmirched for advocating capital punishment,
<br>
communism, genocide, pornography, infanticide, preemptive
<br>
nuclear attack, total personal responsibility, eugenics,
<br>
spirituality, Jew baiting, liberalism, or any other sin that
<br>
you can think of---even including listening to Pat Roberson.
<br>
<p>The basic message behind attacks written in visible anger
<br>
is &quot;SHUT UP&quot; and &quot;WE do not wish to hear about such things&quot;.
<br>
An even more sinister component is &quot;you'll be sorry for
<br>
saying that&quot; and &quot;we will get you&quot;, which are conveyed to
<br>
the target at the subconscious level, and is meant to
<br>
instill fear.
<br>
<p>I myself have suffered such personal abuse for daring to
<br>
admit that if I lived in a free country---i.e., one with
<br>
strong Constitutional protections of liberty, but one
<br>
in which people were free to do whatever they wanted so
<br>
long as it didn't literally violate the constitution
<br>
and freely enacted local laws---I would suggest to a
<br>
the people of my own small community that the laws
<br>
interfering in family matters be abolished, with the
<br>
consequence that polygamy or infanticide would be judged
<br>
not to be the business of the community at large.
<br>
<p>For this, I was raked over the coals, and every manner
<br>
of exhortation was made to silence me.  (I do regret that
<br>
it makes some people sick to hear of such ideas, and for
<br>
them, reading an idea-based forum such as this is probably
<br>
not healthful.)
<br>
<p>Damien continues, and here I think we get to the heart of 
<br>
the matter:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What struck me instantly, aside from the horror and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atrocity of discussing genocidal mass murder as a tool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of `extropic' policy, was what might be termed the awful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocence or context-free character of what Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed for discussion.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  Reports such as Robert's should not be submitted
<br>
without due deference to traditional wisdom.  He ought to
<br>
include a little respect for the memes that make us civilized.
<br>
But he tends not to, and that is why to some he comes across
<br>
as without normal human emotion, or without mercy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I regarded as blazingly self-evident the dire political and memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequelae to any genocidal attack of the kind posited. These were later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spelled out by Emlyn, Anders and Eliezer, none of them notable for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drunken Romantic excess and evasion of reason. Quite the reverse.
</em><br>
<p>Very well, and very good, so long, as I say, it does not
<br>
stoop to intimidation or name calling, which in several
<br>
instances it most surely did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that still misses the deeper point: we might just as easily claim (to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drag in the Hitler/Stalin/Pol Pot card, which is never more appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than in a discussion of genocide as an option) that the ExI list is also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suitable venue to discuss the desirability of the liquidation of the Jews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the homosexuals or the stupid or the Kulaks or the black-skinned or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed the extropians, and all of this, naturally, from a poised and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cautious classical perspective of &quot;rational debate&quot;. My reply is: the ExI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list has to be the *last* place to discuss such mad atrocities as if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were rational or indeed human options.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;As if they were not extreme and stylistic&quot;, I would have
<br>
written instead. They *can* be rational (e.g., the atomic
<br>
bombing of Hiroshima, which I think most thoughtful persons
<br>
admit probably saved many, many lives).  They can also,
<br>
obviously, be quite human.  To characterize them as either
<br>
inhuman or &quot;mad&quot; gains none of the advantages of rational
<br>
criticism, and has all the defects that I described before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Such policy suggestions, especially on a google-archived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, are *incredibly* dangerous (and odious). 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Dangerous&quot;, you mean as in, for example, &quot;Darwin's Dangerous
<br>
Idea?&quot;.  Let's not descend to calling ideas 'dangerous' please.
<br>
And calling them odious achieves exactly what?  (Even if to
<br>
many of us they are indeed odious.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But of course, as I believe Robert understands, my comments were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not meant as `character assassination' or personal abuse.
</em><br>
<p>How do you know what the effects would be of being labeled &quot;autistic&quot;
<br>
and worse, or to have people scream at you?  You might be right in
<br>
Robert's particular case (after all, he does know you personally)
<br>
but wrong in general.  Don't you think that you'd be affected in a
<br>
powerful way to really, really be afraid of mentioning your own
<br>
rational views around some people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's a general point, and sadly one that has to be repeated from time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to time on this list of INTJs.  I approve of Lee Corbin's dislike of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; censorship, but he doesn't seem to understand that what I (and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others, I think) were complaining about wasn't the *voicing* of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detestable genocidal notion, but it's *being considered as a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; option in the first place*.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong: I *do* understand that entirely.  It may seem detestable to you 
<br>
or to me.  Quite different is the effect, however, is the *communication*
<br>
our feelings.  Nothing is intrinsically or provably &quot;detestable&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee will be appalled at my saying that, of course, as if I were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposing `thought policing' or `thought death'.
</em><br>
<p>No, of course not.  Not for a moment did I think that you were
<br>
proposing either one.  It seemed to me that you just didn't realize
<br>
the effects of denouncing people's ideas in the terms you and 
<br>
others did.  As I say, they can be scolded by accusing them of
<br>
&quot;hyperrationality&quot;, of failing to pay heed to tradition and 
<br>
moderation, and many similar things.  We must stop short of
<br>
calling them insulting names, however, or yelling at them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But Lee and Robert don't seem to realize how pathological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unsustainable life would be (how Colombian, perhaps)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we routinely and `rationally' considered killing everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're frightened of or who gets in the way of what we, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our partial ignorance, estimate might be the optimal way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward for humankind.
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  I agree totally with that!  Because here you use the
<br>
content and the tone that ought to have been used from the
<br>
outset.
<br>
<p>Lee
