Ron H:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Yeah, Frederick von Hyek refuted Randy's point, I think, about 1930 or 
<br>
1940 but the left wing is still trying to use it.  See the ROAD TO SERFDOM by 
<br>
<p>Frederick Von Hyek.  The best bindings for the book to the best of knowledge 
<br>
will be found on the 2nd hand book market.
<br>
Ron h.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ron, with all due credit to Herr Doktor, Hayek (of blessed memory) the 
<br>
greatest source of economic turmoil in this society, comes from corporate America, 
<br>
(fortune 500) and their insistance that US technical jobs be off-shored. If one 
<br>
is involved in the IT or Engineering fields; one now knows this to be a true 
<br>
fact of life in the US; despite red-faced sqalling to the contrary. 
<br>
<p>Corp America off-shores jobs to people who will never be able to purchase 
<br>
goods and services of American companies. Furthermore, unemployed Americans, 
<br>
deprived of employment will also, no longer be able to purchase goods and services 
<br>
of said companies. This is just like the Laffer curve, except its straight 
<br>
downward :-)
<br>
<p>The corporations believe that the Chinese or whomever will purchase the goods 
<br>
and services of American owned companies subsidiaries, overseas; however this 
<br>
does not seem to be happening. Thus, destablizing the American economy, as 
<br>
off-shoring is accomplishing, leaves us with no genuine economic recovery. My 
<br>
guess is that this is igniting a class war, fiercer then any this nation has yet 
<br>
seen. 
<br>
<p>Mu guess is that so many unemployed software engineers and programmers will 
<br>
be able to paralyze the big corps, via hack-attacks of some kind. A further 
<br>
guess is, that because the Prez seems disinvolved in economics (as his Daddy also 
<br>
seemed), he too will follow his Dad from office after 1 term. &quot;It's the 
<br>
economy, stupid&quot;  version 2.0 will reign supreme.
<br>
<p>What this will do to the war on terror, ill-defined, and seemingly unwilling 
<br>
to seek the fanatics to their source (House Ibn Saud/Wahabbis), will also 
<br>
undermine the current presidency. I will guess that there will be another 
<br>
successful terror strike against the US (on the New President's watch), and the wheel 
<br>
of chance shall be rolled again.
<br>
<p>The America that emerges post 2008, the economy that emerges post 2008, may 
<br>
be more like an entitlement society (socialism folkies) then the free-market 
<br>
capitalist dreams of the 1980's and 1990's. Serfdom this may be, but economic 
<br>
free-fall will bring this about. One of those entitlements that I write of, will 
<br>
be health care ;-)  $$$
