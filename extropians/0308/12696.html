Ron h.  
<br>
&lt;&lt;For so many of the highly intelligent to be put out of work and sent 
<br>
to pump gas or flip burgers in my opinion will either kick off a heck of a 
<br>
civil explosion or possibly those guys on their own will power another spurt 
<br>
of 
<br>
industrial growth in this country -- maybe.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I see the actions of the boards of directors of these fortune 500 
<br>
companies(since small companies are less financially able to off-shore) as being 
<br>
sufficiently removed from reality. The Russian Czars or Marie Antionette were realists 
<br>
in comparison.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; I don't think the guys moving industry overseas realize that when the 
<br>
jobs go overseas the market will eventually have to go with the jobs.  The 
<br>
economic signs I see seem to indicate that the American consumer has done 
<br>
exactly that -- consumed their assets.  To use a farmer's expression, I don't 
<br>
know 
<br>
how much seed money the consumer has left.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>A kind of protectionism, that would make Smoot-Hartley blush is on its way. 
<br>
But this will be a limit on off-shoring of jobs, not manufactured goods. On the 
<br>
other hand, getting these members of the board and stockholders to live where 
<br>
the jobs are, might be salutory. Getting rid of the greediest and 
<br>
short-sidedist would benefit the US.  
<br>
<p>Have you ever noticed that those who &quot;run&quot; corporations have never developed 
<br>
a business from scratch? They supposedly &quot;growned&quot; already established 
<br>
enterprises; or maybe all they are good at is graduating from the right schools, 
<br>
memberships in the right fraternities, and making speeches which would make any 
<br>
soviet apparatchik green with envy? Almost none have ever been real business 
<br>
people, just &quot;managers&quot;  and marketing schmucks.
<br>
<p>W will follow his daddy out the door (Gambling that the dems will suicide and 
<br>
turn-off the majority of the electorate). Keep your eye on the unemployment 
<br>
rate Ron, because that will be the bell weather issue. All the &quot;sunshine talk&quot; 
<br>
spouted by politicians, business journalists, and economists, will only work 
<br>
when unemployment rate drops and stays down past the election.
