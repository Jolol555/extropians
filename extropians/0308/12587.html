<p>Huh? I get the feeling that you think entanglement links are some
<br>
kind of communications channels you can send information through?
<br>
Entangled particle pairs do have shared quantum information, but
<br>
you cannot get classical information from that. So if module A is
<br>
entangled with module B, you could get perfectly correlated random
<br>
numbers, but not send the contents of A to B over the link.
<br>
<p>Entanglement in itself does not consume any energy, but you still 
<br>
have to send the carrier particle from the origin to the 
<br>
destination to get the link (and once you have used up the 
<br>
entanglement you need another). It is not FTL communication. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the link were somewhat expensive, but had a fast bit-rate, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M-Brain modules would get, say, as large as a desk, or perhaps a shoebox 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and these modules would be linked using some development from, perhaps, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beowulf technology (or Globus?).  Thus each M-Brain module would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps 1000 times the computing capacity of a human brain (or more, I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a bit conservative here) and these modules would be linked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;instantaneously&quot; to a net which could be spatially distributed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but this is based on FTL communication, not entanglement. If 
<br>
we can make small wormholes this might work. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Simply having the possibility of a quantuum linkage doesn't tell one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough about the engineering trade-offs.  And since we don't yet know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to do it, we don't know what the constraints and limitations would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be. 
</em><br>
<p>Hmm? Entanglement is relatively well understood (at least we think
<br>
we understand it, no anomalies that I know of). I get the feeling
<br>
you have not kept up with the field of quantum cryptography, which
<br>
is where most of the action is right now. The latest issue of
<br>
Science has a good article about it.

Long-Distance Free-Space Distribution of Quantum Entanglement

<p><p>We demonstrate the distribution of quantum entanglement via optical 
<br>
free-space links to independent receivers separated by 600 m, with 
<br>
no line of sight between each other. A Bell inequality between 
<br>
those receivers is violated by more than four standard deviations, 
<br>
confirming the quality of the entanglement. This outdoor experiment 
<br>
represents a step toward satellite-based distributed quantum 
<br>
entanglement.
