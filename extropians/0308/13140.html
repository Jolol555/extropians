Kevin Freels asked:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Isn't it odd that everyone loves to complain about the &quot;evil&quot; U.S, but
</em><br>
&lt; when something bad happens they always come to US for help?
<br>
<p>Isn't it odd, that before anyone can even expel his breath in the foreplay
<br>
of making up his mind to ask the US for help, the US is already *there* with
<br>
some schwarzeneggered guys?
<br>
<p>Must be some kind of a helper's syndrome, no?
