<br>
<p><em>&gt; I personally was always fascinated by logic,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Fallacy: The Counterfeit of Argument.&quot;  
</em><br>
<p>Well, you and Harvey N. are on the same footing
<br>
then.  I'm surprised that you don't perceive
<br>
flaws in other people's reasoning then, all the
<br>
time, the way he did (unless I am right and it
<br>
does not happen all that often).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Apparently, some of this got internalized, as I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect scores on every assignment and test when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took logic on the college level, and was able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistently crank out 60-step+ proofs in formal logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without any changes or backtracking on tests.
</em><br>
<p>Carumba!  I recall one fifty step formal proof that
<br>
took me hours.
<br>
<p>But then you write tonight
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, I have never been all that good at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulation of symbols as such.
</em><br>
<p>Well.. (what is the emoticon for total exasperation?)
<br>
Could you provide an example of what kind of problem
<br>
it is that you are good at?  :-)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I was really terrible at trying to prove the limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorems in honors calculus, for example, and I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great difficulty even remembering purely symbolic material. 
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so I have *no* idea of what 60+ step proofs you
<br>
are talking about!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, although I have a lousy symbolic memory, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can hold a kind of kinesthetic model of statements in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my mind, and work with that model intuitively to yield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proofs.  The formal logic that I could handle so well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in college involved statements and their relationships.
</em><br>
<p>Were these statements formal?  I.e., p-&gt;q  etc.?
<br>
Or just puzzles of the Lewis Carroll variety
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. No kitten that loves fish is unteachable;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. No kitten without a tail will play with a gorilla;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Kittens with whiskers always love fish;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. No teachable kitten has green eyes;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. No kittens have tails unless they have whiskers.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.  So you are not an example of what Paul was talking
<br>
about &quot;hyperlexia&quot;?
