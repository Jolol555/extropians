Emlyn writes about his very logical attack on genocide:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a stupid email to have to write.
</em><br>
<p>It was not.  I myself wrote an email to this list last
<br>
year explaining why racism is harmful and actually
<br>
unrealistic.  It's important to elucidate the reasons
<br>
that go along with our feelings, and form themselves
<br>
into an integral whole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Genocide sucks.
</em><br>
<p>This is the sort of dumb phrase that does *not* advance
<br>
understanding.  Worse, had you not just written a clear
<br>
and eloquent (even if overstated in a couple of places)
<br>
rational analysis, then one would conclude from the
<br>
sound bite that perhaps such rational analysis was not
<br>
ready to hand, or perhaps not even possible.
<br>
<p>As for me, everything you said denouncing genocide
<br>
denounces murder just as well.  Genocide is a species
<br>
of mass murder, and that's all.  I very much deny that
<br>
it is somehow worse than other forms of mass murder,
<br>
because that is in effect suggesting that properties
<br>
of mass murder exist that aren't so bad after all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have the whole space of wonderful, complex extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas to play in; can we drop this moronic crap?
</em><br>
<p>What I simply do not understand is how threatened you
<br>
sound and feel.  We *do* have convincing and thoughtful
<br>
arguments rejecting a great many bad things, and we should
<br>
not feel put upon to demonstrate from time to time.  
<br>
Some doubter may ask over and over why evolution works,
<br>
and it would be a big mistake to say that enunciating
<br>
the reasons was a waste of time.
<br>
<p>(Well, about the third time I would feel bored, I admit,
<br>
but I would never feel threatened.)
<br>
