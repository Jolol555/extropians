<em>&gt; I say, what we need here is more levity.
</em><br>
<p>I'm with you 100% on this ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Forgive me, as it may not have a direct bearing on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist agenda,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but Dave Barry once wrote ...:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Democrats seem to be basically nicer people, but they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and again that they have the management skills of celery. They're the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of people who'd stop to help you change a flat, but would somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manage to set your car on fire. I would be reluctant to entrust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cuisinart, let alone the economy. The Republicans, on the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know how to fix your tire, but they wouldn't bother to stop because they'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to be on time for Ugly Pants Night at the country club.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>... and I'm totally with Dave on this one; Democrats are usually more fun to
<br>
hang out with and almost always have better fashion sense than Republicans.
<br>
The average libertarian, on the other hand, makes the average Republican
<br>
look like a cover model for GQ!
