<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a> writes: You are starting to scare me. What capital flight from the United 
<br>
States? Is it major? Or is it just a trend that worries you?  Do you have any 
<br>
references?
<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the situation is at least debatable I prefer to give you my one 
<br>
best reference and let you come to your own conclusions.  You will find an 
<br>
excellent article or article in the following site.
<br>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/articles.asp">http://www.mises.org/articles.asp</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition if you read Thomas Friedman's book Lexus and the Olive 
<br>
Tree you will find other discussion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, yes, I am dead serious about the flow of internatioal capital 
<br>
in and out of the US.  As an example it has been said that it is the foreign 
<br>
purchase of our government bonds that finances our deficit spending.  Dire 
<br>
predictions have been made about what would happen if those foreigners cashing in 
<br>
those bonds as they came due and taking their money home.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff wrote to discuss our economic situation and sounded as if he 
<br>
wanted to pass some laws to correct our situation whatever that is.  I don't think 
<br>
you will convince many capitalists that we need any more laws.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary problem we face as capitalists is that the left wing wants 
<br>
the government to organize us so that we all work for the &quot;common good.&quot;  I 
<br>
don't think you could get a single congregation of Southern Baptists to agree 
<br>
on what the &quot;common good&quot; is or how to translate that idea into practice -- and 
<br>
if you atttempt to get the entire country to agree your problem only gets 
<br>
worse.  That was the role of Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin and Stalin to determine 
<br>
what the common good was.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the brilliance of Capitalism is that every business leader or 
<br>
owner in the country could be a committed monopolist or royalist for that 
<br>
matter and it would make no difference if the law is properly administered.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People often discuss Enron but please note it was private folks that 
<br>
caught them and to date have done much or all of the punishing.  Arthur 
<br>
Anderson is no more.  If Enron survived it is only as a shell of its former self.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several other companies also went down the tubes by a similar process. 
<br>
&nbsp;Incidently at the time my accounting prof assigned me another of the high 
<br>
flyers to analyse as a possible investment.  My assignment was to culminate in a 
<br>
paper I was to write analyzing the company.  I got three annual reports and 
<br>
read them before beginning to apply common accounting analysis procedures.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began my paper by stating that I would report on a regular 
<br>
accounting analysis so he could grade my knowledge of accounting but if this were the 
<br>
real world the I had found a &quot;show stopper&quot; before beginning in depth analysis 
<br>
-- i.e., a straightforward reading of the three annual reports plainly showed 
<br>
the company was either lying, hiding data or both.  They would never get a 
<br>
penny of my investment money.  He graded my analysis.  When he handed the paper 
<br>
back he grinned and nodded yes over my first sentence.
<br>
