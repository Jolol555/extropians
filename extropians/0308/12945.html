<p>This would gruesomely hilarious if our possible future lives hadn't been
<br>
put at risk by this vile prat. 
<br>
<p>&quot;In an exclusive Sports Illustrated shock report, Dr. Herbert W. Dickhead
<br>
today revealed events of unspeakable depravity conducted at St. Pancreas's
<br>
Hospital, where he was recently appointed Chief of Cardiac Surgery.
<br>
<p>&quot;`The scene I confronted when I entered the operating theater left me
<br>
feeling ill for days,' Dickhead told our reporter. `I think I caught
<br>
Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result, and I will be suing the hospital for
<br>
$79.63 million compensation. 
<br>
<p>&quot;`The room was filled with MASKED men and women wearing STRANGE GARB. No
<br>
sooner had the patient been wheeled in that they CHILLED the poor man's
<br>
body, and then CRACKED OPEN HIS CHEST! It was like a scene from the last
<br>
days of the Aztecs, and I don't mean the sports team. 
<br>
<p>&quot;`These fiends TORE OUT HIS LIVING HEART! And then, even as I ran from the
<br>
door to start up my website (please see Paypal link), they STITCHED IN A
<br>
DEAD PERSON'S HEART!'
<br>
<p>&quot;SI is sickened to read of these excesses. Readers are urged to send money
<br>
at once to Dr. Dickhead, who will be taking up his new position as Head of
<br>
Interment at Redemption Mortuary in Scrotum, Nigeria. We eagerly await his
<br>
report on the macabre way DEAD PEOPLE ARE BURIED IN THE GROUND, where they
<br>
quickly ROT INTO SLIME, at this comical yet horrifying establishment.&quot;
