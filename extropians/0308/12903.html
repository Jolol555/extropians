<em>&gt; Of course, not to put too fine a point (guess I do have to do that...), as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an analogy, we Americans and our ancestors built this country into a place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with tremendous competitive advantages: we as voters control and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusive labor market access to the biggest consumer market ever.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that we can charge far more when we sell our labor here in the USA to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor buyers who want to sell products to this enormous consumer market. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Compare to third worlders, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by &quot;exclusive labor market access&quot; exactly?   Are you 
<br>
implying in the above that charging the most for your labor and the most for 
<br>
your products is what is wonderful about this country and should always be 
<br>
protected?   Do I read you right?  If so I strongly disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or, at least we SHOULD have exclusive labor market access. Instead, those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities who BUY labor have convinced us that by giving up this exclusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor market access, we can get those products more cheaply. That is, if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can save enough at Walmart to buy the product.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If your labor is cheaper (including automation), then your unit cost are lower 
<br>
and the saving can be passed on to the consumer.  Where do you have a 
<br>
problem, if you do, with that?
