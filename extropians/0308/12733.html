</em><br>
<p>Ah, but my point was that in the spirit of the earlier discussions
<br>
and in the spirit of Robin's paper on the subject of correcting
<br>
one's biases, should not Bayesians suspect that this enjoyment
<br>
slants their perception?
<br>
<p>(Here of course I must say that I am talking about real Bayesians
<br>
since there are no ideal Bayesians---but then, perhaps no one has
<br>
addressed what *real* Bayesians do or say until this moment!?)
<br>
<p>And if they do acknowledge this bias, then the good Bayesians
<br>
must attempt to control for this glee, by slightly devaluing
<br>
in turn their objective estimates that a certain provocative
<br>
hypothesis is true.  I proudly claim to do just this: whenever
<br>
it looks like I'm enjoying some radical proposal too much, I
<br>
try (perhaps not very hard, he he he) to develop a little
<br>
corresponding skepticism about it.
