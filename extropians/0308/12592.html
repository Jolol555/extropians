I believed that was the proposition.  I find it dubious, but 
<br>
conceivable.   If you were discussing using them as q-bits,  ... well, I 
<br>
don't really know how to think about that.  I REALLY don't.  If that is 
<br>
ever made easy, it could be much more dramatic than thinking of them as 
<br>
communication links.   The estimates that I've seen as to how capable 
<br>
they would be make me rank them as &quot;Don't try to think past this until 
<br>
engineering contraints are more obvious.&quot;  32-qbits would be, O, 32 
<br>
atoms (plus, of course, a whole lot of support equipment, 
<br>
refridgerators, etc.).  And large classes of problems would disolve into 
<br>
&quot;trivially solved&quot;.    Large classes.  And this change could come *quickly*.

<p><em>&gt;Entangled particle pairs do have shared quantum information, but

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Entanglement in itself does not consume any energy, but you still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to send the carrier particle from the origin to the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;entanglement you need another). It is not FTL communication. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I understand that this is current belief, and I accept it as the most 
<br>
probable truth.  Certainly there will be stringent limits on and 
<br>
deviations from this assessment.  But I've seen many &quot;well accepted&quot; 
<br>
theories reinterpreted.  And so I'm unwilling to consider this a &quot;final 
<br>
word&quot;.  (Big crunch, expand gently forever, or tear yourself to 
<br>
ribbons?  What's the fate of the universe.  Just two years ago it was 
<br>
&quot;certain&quot; that the universe would either collapse violently, or expand 
<br>
forever at a decreasing rate.  But now there's doubt.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If the link were somewhat expensive, but had a fast bit-rate, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;M-Brain modules would get, say, as large as a desk, or perhaps a shoebox 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and these modules would be linked using some development from, perhaps, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Beowulf technology (or Globus?).  Thus each M-Brain module would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;perhaps 1000 times the computing capacity of a human brain (or more, I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;being a bit conservative here) and these modules would be linked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;instantaneously&quot; to a net which could be spatially distributed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;throughout the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, but this is based on FTL communication, not entanglement. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we can make small wormholes this might work. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
How does one get the negative energy density to stabilize them?  This is 
<br>
another possibility, but I feel realtively confident that wormhole 
<br>
communicaitons will always be expensive.  But it might have a very fast 
<br>
bit rate.  (Would a high speed laser link cause problems with keeping up 
<br>
the needed negative engery gradient?  I don't know the rules here.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Simply having the possibility of a quantuum linkage doesn't tell one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;enough about the engineering trade-offs.  And since we don't yet know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;how to do it, we don't know what the constraints and limitations would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hmm? Entanglement is relatively well understood (at least we think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we understand it, no anomalies that I know of). I get the feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you have not kept up with the field of quantum cryptography, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is where most of the action is right now. The latest issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Science has a good article about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Many people understand a lot more about it than I do.  I'm basically a 
<br>
programmer.  And, I must admit, cryptography doesn't interest me.   My 
<br>
understanding is more at the level of Scientific American and Science 
<br>
News.  So I know the general outlines of current beliefs on, say, 
<br>
entanglement, but not the details or the certainty.  I do, however, 
<br>
remember the absolute confidence that I heard given to sentences like 
<br>
&quot;We'll never be able to see a single atom.  Quantuum theory forbids 
<br>
it.&quot;  Which is sort of true...but not really, as quantuum dots and the 
<br>
Scanning Electron Microscope showed.  The math was solid, but the 
<br>
translation into physical models was flawed.

<p><em>&gt;Science, Vol. 301, Issue 5633, 621-623, August 1, 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Long-Distance Free-Space Distribution of Quantum Entanglement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Markus Aspelmeyer,* Hannes R. Böhm, Tsewang Gyatso, Thomas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jennewein, Rainer Kaltenbaek, Michael Lindenthal, Gabriel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Molina-Terriza, Andreas Poppe, Kevin Resch, Michael Taraba, Rupert 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ursin, Philip Walther, Anton Zeilinger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We demonstrate the distribution of quantum entanglement via optical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free-space links to independent receivers separated by 600 m, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no line of sight between each other. A Bell inequality between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those receivers is violated by more than four standard deviations, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confirming the quality of the entanglement. This outdoor experiment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represents a step toward satellite-based distributed quantum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entanglement. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I haven't read the article, but I'm aware of it.  And I know that what 
<br>
they demonstrated was the transportation of infomation via ordinary 
<br>
particles.  (Perhaps photons?  I expect so, but I didn't read the 
<br>
article.)  This doesn't, in and of itself, imply anything about other 
<br>
approaches.  So I'm still willing to consider that they might exist.  
<br>
I'm sorry that I misunderstood what you were proposing.  (Which I'm 
<br>
still not certain about.  Qbits is all I could  think of after your 
<br>
response...and that didn't come to mind immediately.)
