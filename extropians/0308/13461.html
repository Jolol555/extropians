<em>&gt; Genuinely not meant contentiously,
</em><br>
<p>Gimme a break!  I'm sorry, I know you're going to say I'm &quot;controlling the
<br>
dialogue,&quot; but I can tell we're so far apart that any dialogue would require
<br>
more effort than I'm willing to devote to the task.  I'll simply note that
<br>
you're post is a classic example of pomo focus on &quot;text&quot; and, if I cared to
<br>
engage in this dialogue, I would probably be drawn into asking whether my
<br>
suspicion that you've been thoroughly imbued with pomo ideas is correct.
<br>
I'd also have to work very hard to keep from being drawn into an insult
<br>
match; I checked out your ISP and found that it was promoting Chomsky, Jim
<br>
Hightower and Michael Moore.  I'm afraid we're so far apart that the effort
<br>
to remain civil is wasted.  Why don't we just agree to disagree and leave it
<br>
at that?
