<p>Obviously not.  It's an amazing part of the &quot;Modern non-ideology&quot; that 
<br>
it simultaneously makes absurd claims like yours below while claiming 
<br>
to be impartial and cooly objective.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Tit-for-tat&quot; as you put it are the DETAILS on which any argument 
<br>
should be based, right?
<br>
<p>That you find the likening to Hitler absurd is well, absurd.  Were you 
<br>
watching very carefully as our government bombed two relatively 
<br>
defenseless countries to smithereens while invading them in order to 
<br>
install puppet governments.
<br>
<p>This is pretty precisely what Hitler did to middle-europe.
<br>
<p>And apparently you don't notice that we are propping up a government 
<br>
that is bulldozing racially-identified houses while the occupants are 
<br>
in them and is holding upwards of 1 Million of &quot;THEM&quot; in &quot;Camps&quot;.
<br>
<p>I never even mentioned the civil liberties issue - you changed the 
<br>
subject.  What I said was that we bombed to smithereens thousands upon 
<br>
thousands of people in two countries while the American nation 
<br>
&quot;appeared to applaud&quot; like you're doing here.  What that means is the 
<br>
MORAL implications of killing someone has been sufficiently blurred by 
<br>
the propaganda machine of our country that &quot;lots of people&quot; think it's 
<br>
okay to use the Shock and Awe strategy.
<br>
<p>But as long as you bring it up, ever heard of Jose Padilla who has been 
<br>
imprisoned without being charged for two years now despite several 
<br>
court orders?  Apparently they're considering moving his trial &quot;out of 
<br>
the country&quot; so that he's out of the jurisdiction of our courts.  After 
<br>
all, he is an American Citizen.  Then there's Sherman Austin.  The list 
<br>
is not small.
<br>
<p>And then, of course, there's this one:
<br>
<p>google:  fatherland security  (hit I'm feeling lucky) enjoy
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Simply because it's been done to death here and serves no useful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose *on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list*, I won't address the points about U.S. foreign military 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough, I won't say another word about it if you won't.  But 
<br>
controlling the discourse is rule number one isn't it?  I suggest &quot;The 
<br>
Power of Ideology&quot; by Istvan Meszaros as an interesting introduction to 
<br>
why political ideology is relevant for any utopian and ipso facto 
<br>
extropian subject matter.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
