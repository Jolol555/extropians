<br>
<p>...The problem with things like this is, they assume data
<br>
that's mostly been false, but is hard to disprove...
<br>
<p><p>I second that, Adrian.
<br>
<p><p>...For instance, stating that economically viable natural
<br>
gas deposits are mostly exhausted...
<br>
<p><p>Of course, as prices go up, economically viable sources
<br>
magically appear.  I grow so very weary of the nattering
<br>
nabobs of negativity.  A hydrocarbon shortage
<br>
would not stop economic growth, it would stimulate it.
<br>
In the U.S. and much of Europe, manufacturing is 
<br>
outsourced to cheaper places, and now we are outsourcing
<br>
software as quickly as we can write specifications.
<br>
Much of our &quot;industry&quot; is involved in redistributing the
<br>
wealth already created instead of creating more, examples
<br>
being the lawsuit industry and the real estate industry.
<br>
<p>If we had an industry which creates wealth and cannot
<br>
be outsourced, such as blanketing the west with
<br>
solar cells, windmills and the infrastructure to
<br>
distribute all that free clean power, the economy 
<br>
would be stimulated to the verge of orgasm.  
<br>
<p><p><p>...Or more simply: bluntly stating that wind and solar
<br>
can not, under any conditions, &quot;replace even a portion
<br>
of hydrocarbon energy&quot; - despite the fact that they
<br>
quite evidently have provided power that, had these technologies never
<br>
been invented, would come from other sources, presumably including
<br>
hydrocarbon energy.
<br>
I don't know how many times I've seen this argument
<br>
before.  I don't know how many times I'll see it
<br>
again...
<br>
<p><p><p>To state that wind power cannot replace hydrocarbon 
<br>
burning is simply absurd.  We really can do it all with 
<br>
renewables: wind, water and sun.  Sure it would require 
<br>
a lot of costly infrastructure, but that is the beauty 
<br>
of capitalism: it gets things done.  Right now, so much
<br>
of our capital is idle, doing nothing but bidding up
<br>
the prices of each other's homes to absurd levels, such
<br>
as those seen in the Sillyclone Valley.  Let's cut that
<br>
nonsense and build something!
<br>
<p><p>...Still, there are some truths here, especially the bit
<br>
about transmission capability not being built...
<br>
<p><p>So lets build it.  The only thing holding this
<br>
world back is that there is still way too much
<br>
oil, coal and gas in the ground that needs to
<br>
be burned up.  spike
