<em>&gt; &gt; As long as people, individually or in political groups, have the desire

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would you outline the progress you anticipate (that is,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe progress (of any kind) requires full transparency at this 
<br>
time.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How does our &quot;desire&quot; ever diminish to the point that groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and individuals *never* initiate the use of force (except in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the defense of private property)?  On first reading, one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that you were calling for a spontaneous change in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why spontaneous?  It will certainly take time.  At some point there might well 
<br>
be some less problematic entity or entities that did have that level of 
<br>
ability to observe us and head of problems.  I just don't believe that humans 
<br>
are at the stage that any one or group of them should have this power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, &quot;full&quot; is not so full as long as there is no real way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to force the powers that be into such transparency.  All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government groups to date do not agree that their operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and proceedings should be transparent.  Again, full oversight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and control of the citizens by the government becomes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; price of transparency.  Again, No, thank you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand.  Why would you be unwilling to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this price?  I think that we should indeed aim for government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be *fully* transparent first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand why anyone even would ask this question who has observed 
<br>
governments in action all their lives.  Do you believe, for instance, that 
<br>
having a government that promotes the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;, would legislate what 
<br>
people do in their bedrooms, talks about taking away citizenship without due 
<br>
process and so on should have the power of complete observation over every 
<br>
aspect of your live?  Exactly what would I conceivably gain that would be 
<br>
worth the very real danger to my own live and freedom?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The two may have to go hand in hand.  The western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments will (rightly) refuse to be transparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so long as formidable enemy societies have huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear arsenals aimed at them, or so long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists and criminals can strike fear into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearts of millions.  (The U.S. appears to have made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great progress on the issue of the former.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The western governments are not exactly angelic entities themselves.  I could 
<br>
make the same argument for myself.  As long as there are people out there who 
<br>
would interfere with many aspects of my life and what I believe it is 
<br>
essential to accomplish if humanity is to have a future, it is right that I 
<br>
should refuse to be fully transparent.    
<br>
<p>No society except Russia has &quot;huge nuclear arsenals&quot; at this time.   What of 
<br>
the government goons and terrorist that can strike fear into free people into 
<br>
the hearts of millions?   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the U.S. is just a bit more powerful, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be persuaded to become completely open at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same moment that universal surveillance is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, yes, Ashcroft is watching all of us to see who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is building basement nukes, but we are all watching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him to make sure that there are no non-public midnight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe that complete transparency is even desirable.  Why?  Because 
<br>
there will always be legitimate disagreements among individuals and groups.  
<br>
There will always be competing projects and efforts.   Only an entity with no 
<br>
interest in the competing efforts could have complete oversight without 
<br>
unfair advantage.  If all could see all then nothing would ever get done 
<br>
without the agreement of a substantial number of observers.  Given that the 
<br>
number of rational, bright and good hearted people is a small minority I 
<br>
don't see how full transparency/accountablity/feedback of all to all could 
<br>
help but have a leving and stagnating affect at best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you really like your Mother, Boss or neighbours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be able to watch while you improve your prostate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; health (as described in a recent post) ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have overcome, at great cost and difficulty, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; notion that I am or would be especially interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for people to observe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Such trivial irrelevancies in the face of potentially creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a complete Big Brother situation are utterly amazing to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh for God's sake.  You always surrender to some internal urge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to harp about something.  One of the issues (recall Natasha's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input) has always been---in this thread---how one would *feel*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about complete transparency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is a matter of perspective.  Giving unlimited information to those who are 
<br>
very likely to abuse it is a much more serious matter than whether someone 
<br>
can see a few &quot;naughties&quot;.     The subject is too serious to not address at 
<br>
its most serious levels.   My I am flattered the master harpist would notice 
<br>
my poor harping.  :-)
