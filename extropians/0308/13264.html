<p>I strongly suggest you try being a stay-at-home parent for a little while 
<br>
before suggesting how easy and unproductive it is.  Clothing doesn't just 
<br>
come into the house by magic, neither does food.   Childcare including 
<br>
carting the children (and often their friends) around isn't exactly a 
<br>
zero-time task either.   In the 50s housewives were most certainly NOT idle.  
<br>
I watched my mother pretty closely growing up.  She was quite busy from 
<br>
before we got up until we went to bed.    Of course there were 5 of us.  But 
<br>
larger families weren't so uncommon then either.
