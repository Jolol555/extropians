I think Robert makes an useful distinction that fits with the meaning I 
<br>
was thinking (but not writing) when I posted. It is quite possible to 
<br>
construct something that you know can be constructed given a centralized 
<br>
project - perhaps the archetypal example would be the Soviet nuclear and 
<br>
hydrogen bombs. Implementing something that is likely possible and well 
<br>
defined as a goal, such as a space program, that is also rather amenable 
<br>
to planning. 
<br>
<p>The real problem comes with planning true innovations in the sense of
<br>
devices or applications that have not been thought of before. By
<br>
definition they are unplannable, although they might be supported
<br>
afterwards. There were no plans for coming up with transistors, personal
<br>
computers or lasers. They were just the result of people playing around
<br>
with physics or building something which they wanted, and later useful
<br>
applications were found/invented. 
<br>
<p>In the context of this thread, I would say Japan has been very 
<br>
successful in creating a climate for the more structured kinds of 
<br>
innovation - innovating towards a goal known to be feasible or even done 
<br>
before, as well as innovating within the context of a pre-existing 
<br>
technology. But Japan does not per capita/investment seem to get the 
<br>
same amount of fundamental innovations as the US. My guess is that the 
<br>
consistent aim at producing results have limited the amount of creative 
<br>
play needed to come up with the true innovations.
<br>
<p>As for AI, I don't think it belongs to the category of known goals or 
<br>
improvements of current methods. We still need some radical new 
<br>
thinking, and that is hard to plan.
