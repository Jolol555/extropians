Some 18 molecules are able to stimulate the effect of calorie restriction, one 
<br>
of the few things reliably shown to extend lifespans:
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20030824/hl_nm/health_longlife_dc&amp;e=1&amp;ncid">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20030824/hl_nm/health_longlife_dc&amp;e=1&amp;ncid</a>®<br>
<p>&quot;... Sinclair and his team have been looking for what he calls the Holy Grail of 
<br>
aging research: molecules that activate the enzymes that in turn influence the 
<br>
genes that regulate aging.
<br>
<p>Now, they say, they have found those molecules.
<br>
<p>Sinclair's team partnered with BIOMOL, a Pennsylvania company, to screen 
<br>
thousands of molecules to see which ones might activate the enzymes.
<br>
<p>Not only did they find a group of 18 molecules that fit the bill -- resveratrol 
<br>
being just one -- but all of them came from plants and were produced in response 
<br>
to harsh environmental conditions like drought.
<br>
<p>&quot;We think we know why these plants make these molecules. We think it's part of 
<br>
their own defense response, and we also believe that animals and fungi that live 
<br>
on the plants can pick up on these clues,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>To illustrate that theory, Sinclair noted that red wines from regions with 
<br>
harsher growing conditions -- Spain, Chile, Argentina and Australia -- contain 
<br>
more resveratrol than those produced where grapes are not highly stressed or 
<br>
dehydrated.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think this is like masturbation to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The 
<br>
doctors' advice will be easy to follow.
<br>
<p>And it might explain why vegetarians look so youthful and seem to live somewhat 
<br>
longer.
