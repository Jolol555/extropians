<em>&gt; ...This thread strikes an interesting cord for me. In my opinion one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unaddressed (and unintended) consequences of unbridled capitalism(*) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over time natural resources, i.e. land, slowly ends up in the hands of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, this consequence is intended.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrates the beauty and power of unbridled capitalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matt, when wealth is evenly spread over the population, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just money.  But when it is concentrated in the hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a few, then it becomes CAPITAL and it takes on a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; POWER to create new wealth and make things happen.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because when money does concentrate, notice that it always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to fall into the hands of those who know how to USE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the capital to create more wealth, to the benefit of everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether by creating jobs or by creating products to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchased by the proletariat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Contrast this to unbridled communism, which destroys the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of land, since the government cannot be trusted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not seize the land on a whim (so why pay much for it?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communism destroys wealth by reducing incentive to struggle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and take risks.  Take away the rewards of competition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and people will not compete.  If people do not compete,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do not achieve excellence.  They eventually get to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where they achieve practically nothing, living in a dingy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gray hell, struggling for mediocrity but not getting there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia will likely not recover from the curse of communism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining population...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would work that way except for the fact that land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not a critical resource anymore.  In fact most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land is actually a liability.  Land in cities has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great deal of value, and is increasing.  Intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property carries value and is increasing.  Farmland?  Nah,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's just dirt, and the tax structure of the U.S. is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it harder all the time to make money from it.
