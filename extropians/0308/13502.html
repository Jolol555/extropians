Hmm. I replied to Robert Bardbury's
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The interesting suggestion that Brain makes is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;government should literally give money away.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Gee--now there's an astonishing brand-new idea for dealing with robotic
</em><br>
productivity.
<br>
<em>&gt;Or maybe he read THE SPIKE back in 1997.
</em><br>
<p>(Now that I've skimmed those url'd pages, I see that he hasn't--although
<br>
his $25,000 suggestion for a guaranteed income exactly matches my own (and
<br>
the late Robert Theobald's).
<br>
<p>Roughly simultaneously, Reason cried out in pain:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Narry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a mention of the job creation in new industries, just the same old
</em><br>
zero-sum
<br>
<em>&gt;    protectionist nonsense based on the assumption that people are owed
</em><br>
security
<br>
<em>&gt;    and a livelihood with no effort on their part, funded by the wealthy via
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    forced redistribution of wealth. Even the anti-capitalist,
</em><br>
anti-free-market
<br>
<em>&gt;    arguments in this thing are tired and by the numbers, pushing the
</em><br>
effects of
<br>
<em>&gt;    government intervention (no5t labeled as such, of course) in trade and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    markets as reasons for more government intervention. It's sad, sad,
</em><br>
sad. And
<br>
<em>&gt;    stupid. Massively, massively stupid.
</em><br>
<p>&lt; coff &gt;
<br>
<p>I'd demur on that `massively, massively stupid', obviously. Reason, I think
<br>
you're jumping the gun. Brain's case is precisely that there *can't* be
<br>
much in the way of `job creation in new industries' for the robotically
<br>
downsized (unless I'm reading that in). I found his suggestions most
<br>
laughable when he tried to give his prescription a `turbo-capitalist' spin:
<br>
selling advertising space on the rear of greenbacks, under public bridges,
<br>
on the Washington Memorial. Pure '50s Pohl&amp;Kornbluth parody. But if his
<br>
remedies are incomplete, that's where people like us need to step in with
<br>
some imagination.
<br>
<p>As for `funded by the wealthy via forced redistribution of wealth', I
<br>
believe Brain is saying that redistribution BACK to consumers of large
<br>
amounts of Danegeld forcibly stripped FROM them by insanely hungry and
<br>
sometimes grossly law-breaking CEOs is more the style of the funding proposal.
<br>
<p>In general terms, here is my own apologia from THE SPIKE:
<br>
<p>=======
<br>
<p>The run up to the Spike will deepen today's dreadful problems, but also
<br>
ease their solution, if we keep our nerve and use our brains. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A corporation that downsizes its work-force today, in favor of robots, is
<br>
surviving as a beneficiary of the human investment of the past. Its current
<br>
productivity, after all, are the outcome of every erg of accumulated human
<br>
effort that went into creating the economy and technological culture that
<br>
made those robots possible. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's not look at a guaranteed income as a `natural right', like the
<br>
supposed innate rights to freedom of speech and liberty. Rather, it is an
<br>
inheritance, something owed to all the children of a society whose
<br>
ancestors for generations have together built, and purchased through the
<br>
work of their minds and hands, the resource base sustaining today's
<br>
cornucopia. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to the present structure of society--a prejudice doomed in any
<br>
case, as we have seen, by the on-coming Spike--some people believe that
<br>
most of their fellow humans won't work without an external goad. Others
<br>
agree that incentives are required, but hold that these can spring from
<br>
within, and need not depend upon the threat of hunger and destitution. In
<br>
the short run, this debate can be avoided, for a guaranteed income would
<br>
abolish severe poverty more effectively than current schemes that tend to
<br>
act as a disincentive to taking up part-time work.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while a guaranteed wage would ensure you the bare necessities, your
<br>
craving for luxuries and a higher standard of living would hardly
<br>
disappear. Few of us now are content merely to earn a subsistence income.
<br>
Those who are--the `shiftless scoundrels' who live their rudimentary life
<br>
of ease on the dole in sunny climes--will continue to do so, but without
<br>
costing society the extra burden of trying to hunt them down and punish
<br>
them for refusing to take the jobs that don't exist.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must hope, as the juggernaut of technological change rolls onward,
<br>
is that material incentives alone really are not more important than other
<br>
driving forces of the human spirit. The artist and the scientist are two
<br>
celebrated instances of a deep human hunger and enthusiasm for creative
<br>
activity, the kind that draws people together while being intensely
<br>
rewarding to the individual. It's very likely, no doubt, that some arduous
<br>
jobs traditionally the domain of depressed and excluded groups would find
<br>
no takers if survival were no longer at stake. In wealthy nations like the
<br>
United States, bordering less well-off countries, a constant influx of
<br>
illegal migrants testifies to the reluctance of citizens with high
<br>
expectations to do the sweaty work. 
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anthropologist Conrad Arensberg claimed that every successful adaptive
<br>
innovation, social or biological, always has a further effect than the
<br>
immediate and conservative: `the opening of a vast new door, a splendid
<br>
serendipity'. It is impertinent and finally futile to try to anticipate
<br>
serendipity, but it seems fair to assume that the adoption of a general
<br>
right to a share in the inherited productivity of the human race will be
<br>
liberating, more often than not, to the spirit. 
<br>
<p>Pre-paid lunch
<br>
<p>Surprisingly, the laissez-faire writer Robert A. Heinlein placed that
<br>
sentiment in the mouth of a utopian judge condemning a reckless rugged
<br>
individualist: `From a social standpoint, your delusion makes you as mad as
<br>
a March Hare.' But it was Heinlein himself, coiner of the libertarian
<br>
slogan TANSTAAFL (`There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch'), who, as
<br>
narrator, offered the most stinging commentary:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steel tortoise gave MacKinnon a feeling of Crusoe-like independence.
<br>
It did not occur to him his chattel was the end product of the cumulative
<br>
effort and intelligent co-operation of hundreds of thousands of men, living
<br>
and dead.
<br>
<p>Granted this perspective, how should we arrange our affairs during the
<br>
disruptive decades ahead? The ways in which science and technology were
<br>
(ab)used in the last century powered a catastrophic erosion of
<br>
biodiversity, and in doing so damaged human communities as well. The global
<br>
economy is still felling rain forests, polluting the skies and scything
<br>
through the diversity of species. In the long run, in a world of televised
<br>
fantasy living and virtual reality simulation--let alone the Spike's
<br>
machine intelligence and nanotechnology--such traditional methods will be
<br>
altogether unstable. Should we put an end, for the moment, to conspicuous
<br>
consumption? Yet it is exactly the economy of relentless and often
<br>
trivialized consumption that drives the technologies that will peak in the
<br>
cornucopia of the Spike.
