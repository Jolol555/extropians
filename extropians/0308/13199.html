Hello Robert,
<br>
<p>Thank you for reading, responding.
<br>
<p>Uploading, yes. But first need to refine/isolate the essential element 
<br>
of the 'stuff' to be uploaded. Matter transmutation: Not merely 
<br>
changing state: becoming something new. For example, Could body be to 
<br>
consciousness-&gt;'stuff' as uranium is to radium-&gt; helium?
<br>
<p>Current 'reality'? You mean the life-death encapsulated event 
<br>
assumptions: the rigidly narrow 'moment of death,' 'moment of birth' 
<br>
memes? Human gestation takes a minimum of 18 months - 9 inside, 9 
<br>
onside and then some. If life-death transitions are on a continuum over 
<br>
time, then might uploading be similar? Could uploading be occurring all 
<br>
the time? Could uploading efficiency and intensity increase between 
<br>
those persons who are most alike? As in 'like attracts like'? And the 
<br>
'meeting of minds'?
<br>
<p>Of what 'stuff' dreams are made? Have our ancestors already been 
<br>
uploaded into us? If we can tune into that 'stuff' will we see so far 
<br>
back, we'll see Death dancing on the winds of time like an impotent 
<br>
buffoon?
<br>
<p>~ankara
<br>
Trust no assumption.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20How%20do%20you%20calm%20down%20the%20hot-heads?%20/%20Death%20meme">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Isn't there a difference between believing [in death]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds like the &quot;Leon Kass&quot; position -- i.e. people *should* die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and the awareness of it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sounds like the everyone else who has had someone close to them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Death, currently, is part of reality.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Wouldn't the absence of an awareness of death seem like immortality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps, but it is hard to maintain that lack of awareness at this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless you are very very young.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why can't we construct a better matter transmutation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I understand this statement properly, I have toyed with this idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be the ability to leave behind and make available to others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of ones knowledge, experiences and history separately from ones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness or free will.  It is kind of like bequeathing &quot;What you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are&quot; but not &quot;Who you are&quot;.  I would tend to view this as a reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic action, particularly if the technology were available to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone to pick up the information base.  But I think that requires 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an uploaded form and we don't know yet if that is really possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
