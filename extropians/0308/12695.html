Mitch,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with what you said excepting that in my humble opinion you 
<br>
didn't go far enough -- not by half.  However believing that does not take away 
<br>
an Iota from Dr. Von Hayek and the truth of what he was saying.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read Technaissance by Mike McGee it seems plain that the first 
<br>
Renaissance was powered by the printing press, etc., empowering the more 
<br>
intelligent members of the society.  However there was only a fraction of that 
<br>
group that was empowered (many just kept digging those ditches) Still Gutenberg, 
<br>
etc., empowered enough to kick off a Renaissance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If THE BELL CURVE and Mike McGee's book is to be believed since about 
<br>
1900 AD the increasing empowerment of the GT has been kicking off a new 
<br>
Renaissance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so many of the highly intelligent to be put out of work and sent 
<br>
to pump gas or flip burgers in my opinion will either kick off a heck of a 
<br>
civil explosion or possibly those guys on their own will power another spurt of 
<br>
industrial growth in this country -- maybe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think the guys moving industry overseas realize that when the 
<br>
jobs go overseas the market will eventually have to go with the jobs.  The 
<br>
economic signs I see seem to indicate that the American consumer has done exactly 
<br>
that -- consumed their assets.  To use a farmer's expression, I don't know 
<br>
how much seed money the consumer has left.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mitch, I don't disagree with you.  I think you have been a little 
<br>
conservative in your predictions.
<br>
Ron h.
