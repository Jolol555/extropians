Rafal:
<br>
&lt;&lt;### This is an old defense - &quot;I really like my butler, he's black, but a
<br>
good man, nevertheless. But you couldn't let blacks work on their own,
<br>
listen to those scumbag abolitionists and set their own prices. They need
<br>
supervision, visas, regulations so they won't compete with me, so I can keep
<br>
my cushy job. Except for my butler, let them clean sewers&quot;.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This doesn't seem to be my defense. Mine is that the greediest (not 
<br>
necessarilly the very richest) segment of the economy are sending jobs overseas. This 
<br>
will shrink the US middle class, and destablize the American economy. There are 
<br>
those who, seemingly, are unconcerned or even jubilant about this 
<br>
development. I am not.
<br>
<p>Rafal:
<br>
&lt;&lt;More quotes from a protectionist:
<br>
<p>&quot;And those bosses, they are worthless scum, every single one of them. In
<br>
fact, you can't become a manager unless you are a stupid, incompetent
<br>
suck-up.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And I didn't want to buy this imported car, really, but it was so cheap I
<br>
couldn't resist. Tell those loser GM bosses to get their act together, or
<br>
else I won't buy any of their cars. I have choice, you know.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And tell them suck-up bosses who don't want to hire me, better think it
<br>
over, or else I'll come over with some buddies, and you won't have no choice
<br>
nomore.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yep.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, the Fortune 500 send their buddies, lobbyists to DC to get their way 
<br>
with this economy. Now its back-firing and according to an article in the Wall 
<br>
Street Journal, 
<br>
this will cost W the election.
