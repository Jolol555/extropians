=======
<br>
<p>Leave it to Robin Williams to come up with the perfect plan... what we need now
<br>
is for our UN Ambassador to stand up and repeat this message. 
<br>
<p>Robin Williams' plan...(Hard to argue with this logic): 
<br>
<p>I see a lot of people yelling for peace but I have not heard of a plan for
<br>
peace. So, here's one plan: 
<br>
<p>1) The US will apologize to the world for our &quot;interference&quot; in their affairs,
<br>
past &amp;present. We will promise never to &quot;interfere&quot; again. 
<br>
<p>2) We will withdraw our troops from all over the world, starting with Germany,
<br>
South Korea and the Philippines. They don't want us there. We would station
<br>
troops at our borders. No more sneaking through holes in the fence. 
<br>
<p>3) All illegal aliens have 90 days to get their affairs together and leave.
<br>
We'll give them a free trip home. After 90 days the remainder will be gathered
<br>
up and deported immediately, regardless of who or where they are. France would
<br>
welcome them. 
<br>
<p>4) All future visitors will be thoroughly checked and limited to 90-day visits
<br>
unless given a special permit. No one from a terrorist nation would be allowed
<br>
in. If you don't like it there, change it yourself, don't hide here. Asylum
<br>
would not ever be available to anyone. We don't need any more cab drivers. 
<br>
<p>5) No &quot;students&quot; over age 21. The older ones are the bombers. If they don't
<br>
attend classes, they get an &quot;F&quot; and it's back home, baby. 
<br>
<p>6) The US will make a strong effort to become self sufficient energywise. This
<br>
will include developing non polluting sources of energy but will require a
<br>
temporary drilling of oil in the Alaskan wilderness. The caribou will have to
<br>
cope for a while. 
<br>
<p>7) Offer Saudi Arabia and other oil producing countries $10 a barrel for their
<br>
oil. If they don't like it, we go someplace else. 
<br>
<p>8) If there is a famine or other natural catastrophe in the world, we will not
<br>
&quot;interfere&quot;. They can pray to Allah or whomever, for seeds, rain, cement or
<br>
whatever they need. Besides, most of what we give them gets &quot;lost&quot; or is taken
<br>
by their armies. The people who need it most get very little, anyway. 
<br>
<p>9) Ship the UN Headquarters to an island some place. We don't need the spies and
<br>
fair weather friends here. Besides, it would make a good homeless shelter or
<br>
lockup for illegal aliens. 
<br>
<p>9b) Use the buildings as replacement for the twin towers. 
<br>
<p>10) All Americans must go to charm and beauty school. That way, no one can call
<br>
us &quot;Ugly Americans&quot; any longer. 
<br>
<p>Now, ain't that a winner of a plan. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The Statue of Liberty is no longer saying 'Give me your poor, your tired, your
<br>
huddled masses. She's got a baseball bat and she's yelling, &quot;You want a piece of
<br>
me?&quot;
