</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There are certainly transhumanists who partially share these beliefs (I 
<br>
would call them cybergnostics); like any good criticism it has some 
<br>
truth.
<br>
<p>But I think the key mistake made in the criticism is that it cannot
<br>
imagine the other side: that we want better bodies to more fully enjoy
<br>
life. The ascetic ideal is well represented in our culture, but the idea
<br>
of hedonic engineering or sensual technology is not.  With T1000-style
<br>
liquid bodies we could make Freud blush about &quot;polymorphous perversity&quot;, 
<br>
and the descriptions of limited omniscience from a few threads back 
<br>
really have a deep sensual in-the-world quality. But relatively few 
<br>
authors describe this, and of course most of us transhumanists do not 
<br>
really start out our spiels by pointing it out (we usually start by 
<br>
complaining about death and taxes, and showing how they will be swept 
<br>
away). Maybe the best start of any transhumanist presentation is &quot;Life 
<br>
is wonderful! I want more of it for everyone!&quot;
