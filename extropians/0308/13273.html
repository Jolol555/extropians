</em><br>
<p>Well, we can drive them on electricity produced by a variety of processes 
<br>
including wind, solar, biomass, SPS, nuclear... whatever. 
<br>
<p>This is despite
<br>
<em>&gt; the TV jourmalism of the local variety; who spout on about solar cars, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last 35 years. Let the engineers produce, as an example, a methanol

</em><br>

<em>&gt; have a scientific estimate on how many windmills will be needed to replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil wells, analyze the cost of production; and see if there is any profit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree that wind and solar (at least at earth's surface before the advent of 
<br>
nanomaterial covering quite a bit of everything), isn't going to replace 
<br>
gas/petroleum.  But taking advantage of some of all available ways to crack 
<br>
out hydrogen and/or produce electricity and going to electric or fuel cell 
<br>
transporation is certainly doable and not horrifically expensive to gear up 
<br>
to.    If we count all the cost of our oil, including entanglements in nasty 
<br>
and costly messes, a percentage of the cost of fighting and cleaning up after 
<br>
terrorism and so on, the costs for our current choices is a good bit higher 
<br>
than what we pay at the pump.    Where is the profit in $40 billion 
<br>
dollars/month poured into the sands of Iraq?    How much more profit will be 
<br>
poured out when Saudi Arabia blows up in our faces?    As I see it, we cannot 
<br>
afford to depend on oil any longer for so much of our power needs.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alternatively, use beamed down power from Gigantic solar power sats, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; split water into Hydrogen and oxygen; then add a carbon source and...you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the idea. There may actually be a dark horse energy miracle, if Craig
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ventner is able to create a bacterium that likes to make plentiful amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hydrogen, without ruining the ecology of the oceans; should such a biug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escape into the Pacific.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yeah.  Some of these are certainly worthwhile.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alternatively, there are some prodigious petroleum and natural gas sources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that apparently have been ignored because of the massive volume and clever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marketing of OPEC oil. Yet, that take political will to go after, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks like the current generation of pols, are fresh out of political will;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them ignoramuses, corrupt, or both.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oil is too bloody useful to simply burn for power even if you could stop being 
<br>
dependent on very politically messy MidEast sources. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Or have I missed your reasoning on this account? We have lots of technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstration devices; yet none that I have heard of are anywhere near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affordable
</em><br>
<p>Well, I've looked forward for awhile to paying off the Pontiac Grand Prix.  It 
<br>
gets an average 24.9 mpg.  Not terrible but I am seriously considering 
<br>
trading it in for a hybrid like the Prius.
