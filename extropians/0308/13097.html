<a href="mailto:natashavita@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Extropians%20List">natashavita@earthlink.net</a> writes: &quot;Many people left the list prior because they felt that 
<br>
sickened by what you and others have written.  This is precisely why we are 
<br>
trying to find a resolve and deal with the problems.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;###Isn't that an interesting comment?  More personal attacks were made 
<br>
on Mike Lorry after his departure than he ever made while he was on line.  He 
<br>
was non PC and he debated ideas but any personal comments were few and mild.  
<br>
But in listening to the group I get the idea that Mike's sole offense was 
<br>
that he did not agree with you, not that he was personally insulting.  I get the 
<br>
idea that you can't distinguish between the two.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You quoted me, &quot;So why am I replying?  Because I consider it 
<br>
despicable to continue attacking Mike in his absence.  As he isn't here to defend 
<br>
himself I have spoken on his behalf.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you replied, &quot;What attacks against Mike?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Natasha, that goes beyond reason.  If you don't know then please read 
<br>
the list that you and those close to you are purported to own.  If you have 
<br>
read those attacks and are that biased, then there simply is nothing I can say.  
<br>
But please don't ask me to accept that as an informed and unbiased opinion.
<br>
