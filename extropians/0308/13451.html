<p><em>&gt; One possible work-around that comes to mind is that

To which Brett Paatsch responded:
<br>
<p>Not clear what you mean here.
<br>
<p>[Me again, to clarify]
<br>
<p>As you observed,... 
<br>
<p>[you]   &quot;What made 1441 special was the US a permanent
<br>
member got the UN involved with Iraq and thereby
<br>
waived any right it might have to attack Iraq on
<br>
exactly the same grounds as the UN was considering
<br>
action against Iraq.
<br>
<p>...the US signed on to resolution 1441, then went on
<br>
to attack Iraq unilaterally, and arguably in
<br>
violation--you used the term &quot;breach&quot;--of the charter.
<br>
<p><p>Could such a breach be cause to impeach, nullify,
<br>
censure, limit, revoke, place on probation, etc, the
<br>
US or its power within the UN organization, and
<br>
thereby deprive the US of its UNSC veto power?
<br>
<p>Realistically(to me anyway), in terms of realpolitik
<br>
this is far fetched to the point of absurdity, like
<br>
GWB being impeached by a republican-controlled
<br>
congress (House of Reps lays the charge, Senate
<br>
conducts the 'trial'.  Yeah, right.), for blatantly
<br>
fabricating a case for war, but I was just wondering.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
