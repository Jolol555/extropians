### Good you put the quotation marks around &quot;owners&quot;. The joint ownership
<br>
form that is a state is the antithesis of individual ownership, and by
<br>
disconnecting gains from work and losses from responsibility, it diminishes
<br>
you and everybody it touches.
<br>
<p>No, you are not an owner, you are being owned.
