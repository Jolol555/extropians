<p>Better for whom?
<br>
<p>Assuming you meant the 1900s, and if by &quot;earlier&quot; you meant before the 1920s
<br>
... then how can you possibly say that life was better for women before they
<br>
got the vote?
<br>
<p>How can you say life was better in the 1930s during the depression and
<br>
prohibition years?
<br>
<p>How can you say life was better in the 1940s when we had segregated armed
<br>
forces?
<br>
<p>How can you say life was better in the 1950s when schools, restaurants,
<br>
movie houses, cleaners, and drinking fountains were segregated (mainly in
<br>
the southern states of the USA), and &quot;exclusive&quot; clubs and &quot;exclusive&quot;
<br>
neighborhoods (elsewhere besides the southern states in the USA as well)
<br>
were de rigueur?
<br>
<p>How can you possibly say that life was better for *anyone* before the civil
<br>
rights laws came into being in the 1960s?
<br>
<p>And how can you possibly say that life was better for gays before the 1970s?
<br>
<p>That takes care of all the decades in the 1900s by which you could have
<br>
meant anytime &quot;earlier&quot; in the century.
<br>
<p>I would be curious to know what you meant by &quot;life [being] better&quot; in the
<br>
1900s -and for whom?
<br>
