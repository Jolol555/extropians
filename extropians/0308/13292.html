<em>&gt; The question to ask is how many 18 to 25 year old people are

<em>&gt; population.  When young men are employed crime goes down.  When young men

<em>&gt; Probably little or none at all. It's one of the Great Myths of the gun nut

<em>&gt; Dunno if it still exists, but there used to be a famous cop bar not too far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from LAPD main headquarters. It was run by a retired cop, it's where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually all the patrons were off-duty (or even ON-duty) cops. It had a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cop bar name, something like &quot;Code 40&quot; or whatever, it had cop car lights 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and police department patches decorating the interior. It was *really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously* a COP BAR.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yet, one, two times a year, some jagoff would burst in waving a 
</em><br>

<em>&gt; There's a gun store here in town with an indoor pistol range.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's be clear about this...it's a gun store.  The employees are armed (they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; openly carry handguns in belt holsters).  They are, at any given time within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arms reach of several handguns and/or rifles and/or shotguns, plus boxes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ammunition.  At any given time, there's an unknown--possibly as high as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10--number of customers in the store, WITH LOADED WEAPONS IN THEIR HANDS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firing them at targets.  Some of these people are no doubt daydreaming about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plugging some burglar or gang member or something as they do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this place has been robbed at least twice in the last 10 years, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times resulting in the robber being killed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm tempted to believe that people who try to rob cop bars or pistol ranges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during business hours have simply got to be trying to kill themselves...but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I'm reminded how colossally dumb many criminals really are...

<em>&gt; My first day in law school my civil procedure teacher, Jon Waltz, spent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half the first lecture period in civ pro class telling us &quot;war stories&quot; of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his times as a practicing lawyer (probably to impress us that he was &quot;cool&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or something), and  as a part of that presentation he imparted a piece of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wisdom that has remained with me years after my legal career ended:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Criminals are stupid. That's why they get caught.&quot;

<em>&gt; They didn't teach that in law school, I had to learn that from experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is, in a way, unfortunate, but my experience of cops in law practice was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that were a cop to tell me right now that the sun is shining (it is, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FWIW) I wouldn't believe him until I looked out the window and verified it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you might imagine, that made life interesting when I married my second 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ex-wife and thereby picked up two cops as brothers-in-law.

A better answer is that the population is aging.  The late teens-early 
<br>
twenties are always the high crime years.  As a smaller fraction of the 
<br>
population is in that age brackett, the amount of actual crime diminishes.
<br>
<p>I also have a question as to the techniques for measurement, but such 
<br>
quibbles aren't needed when placed against the population ages.
