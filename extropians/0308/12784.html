</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are we having funny slapping around hard-assed positions without due

</em><br>
<p>No, Samantha, all these positions---on each side---are being
<br>
carefully considered by some people on each side.  Your
<br>
invective is wasted  ;-)
<br>
<p>Yes, for many people, Rafal used exactly the right word: pretext.
<br>
For many others, of course, that is not the right word.  So read
<br>
his sentence carefully before firing back.
<br>
<p>You wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The unemployed paid the unemployment taxes while 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were working!
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but they had no *choice*.  For many, like you, had they
<br>
had the freedom to invest that money, and did so, they would
<br>
be vastly better off.  But &quot;freedom&quot; is not a high consideration
<br>
in many socialist mind-sets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have paid mine up for an awful lot of years, far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I could possibly consume if unemployed these days.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you STAYED unemployed long enough, you obviously
<br>
could.  See how the incentives are wrecked?  Right now, the
<br>
money is not legally yours.  So if you were unemployed, it
<br>
would be either use it or lose it.  So the unemployed have
<br>
diminished incentive to look for work until it runs out.
<br>
<p>Yet I do not see the other side actually grapple with the
<br>
logic my side throw out.  How often do those on your side
<br>
actually use the word &quot;incentive&quot;?
