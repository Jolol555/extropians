</em><br>
<p>No, it's filtering *people*. I don't know about your individual eagerness to
<br>
spread the memes of transhumanism. But If you already fail to listen to
<br>
people who were determined enough to subscribe to a transhumanist email
<br>
list, I wonder how much patience you will have with people who never  heard
<br>
of this meme complex before. From my point of view you (plural: all people
<br>
with killfiles) already fail at this very first step of a specific email
<br>
list, where people meet to talk about future development and how to realize
<br>
these ideas.
<br>
<p>The very existence of killfiles and the very choice of this word might be
<br>
taken as an insult.
<br>
<p>To refer to killfiles as a generally accepted internet custom does not
<br>
convince me. I always thought we wanted to make it better.
<br>
<p>By the way, as far as I am concerned, I simply want to expand my knowledge.
<br>
That's why I am here. I am no missionary and I am not interested in gaining
<br>
power and influence in society to boost technological or transhumanist
<br>
development.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For an implementation, I'd actually like the option to receive all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from my killfile, but with a tag in the subject like &quot;[filtered]&quot; so thatI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can have them automatically shunt them into a different mail folder, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do like to peruse my killfile occasionally.
</em><br>
<p>Honestly, I do not understand why you make such a fuzz about ist, adding
<br>
more control procedures, or urging list administrators to implement more
<br>
functions that might make the system susceptible to collapses.
<br>
<p>Why don't you (plural again) just relax and let the news stream into your
<br>
computer and forget about control for a while  . . .
