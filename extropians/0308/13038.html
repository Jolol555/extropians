<em>&gt; About a week ago, a contributor of long standing was suddenly

<em>&gt; and summarily expelled from this list, an act that seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me capricious and perhaps arbitrary, and for several days after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, I didn't feel like posting anything.  During that time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that I was just annoyed, and that it would pass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It was not in the least capricious or arbitrary.  It was a long time coming 
<br>
that some action to actually enforce certain standards would be taken.  Nor 
<br>
was the particular person an arbitrary choice.   I am sorry that you can't 
<br>
see that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But my feelings on the matter did not change in the days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following, and I finally figured out why.  It was due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the large number of posts I'd written and threads that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had started in the past two years extolling to the skies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list and the people who ran it; the theme of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many, many posts was that through thick and thin, freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of speech had always won out in the end on the Extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Freedom of speech does not require the freedom to verbally attack and demean 
<br>
without consequences.   I am sorry if you believe it does or should.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I now feel like a fool.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I suggest you use your fine mind to see that that is due to one particular 
<br>
interpretation of the facts and of what the freedom you care about really 
<br>
means and requires. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I could live with that---after all, one does many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolish things in life and one gets over it after a while.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there is something far worse than looking or being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will not be a hypocrite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Admirable.  But that doesn't make you right in your interpretation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My only choices are to either leave this list, or begin a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of posts taking back all my fine words, renouncing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my praise, and admitting that my perceptions had been wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or else pleading that actions like this never recur, or, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.---moves sure to foment controversy and ugly discord (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would probably result in my own expulsion anyway).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is very strange that someone who claims their are no objective values would 
<br>
claim that utter unregulated free speech apparently with no consequences for 
<br>
various offenses is such an objective and inarguable value that you would be 
<br>
morally sullied if you accepted actions based on any other view.    That you 
<br>
act like it was some kind of betrayal of clear values is even more amazing.
<br>
<p>I hope you rethink this.  I value your participation a lot.
