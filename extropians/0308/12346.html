<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; We have the whole space of wonderful, complex extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas to play in; can we drop this moronic crap?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I simply do not understand is how threatened you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sound and feel.  We *do* have convincing and thoughtful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arguments rejecting a great many bad things, and we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not feel put upon to demonstrate from time to time.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some doubter may ask over and over why evolution works,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and it would be a big mistake to say that enunciating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the reasons was a waste of time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes it takes a bit of heat under the collar to motivate writing a post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that one. Maybe I'm just human after all. Emotions will creep in at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of inconvenient times, the pesky things.
</em><br>
<p>I think that the emotions should be there *all* the time, 
<br>
and that your essay was a wonderful example of how to 
<br>
integrate them into one's rational exposition.  As I said
<br>
before, one should only be semi-confident of one's conjectures
<br>
when both one's thought and feelings are in alignment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was pretty angry at the time.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but no one could tell, which is the *important* part.
<br>
And again, I commend you for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have this hazy idea that genocide is at the extreme edge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a package of very nasty memes that are gaining currency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nowadays in western geopolitics, a package that includes xenophobia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intolerance and self righteousness.
</em><br>
<p>So what else is new?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fear of the unknown, and ignorant petty selfishness, qualities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which seem to be encouraged more strongly as time wears on,
</em><br>
<p>Not at all!  What decade do you suggest exhibited fewer such
<br>
qualities or in which they were less pronounced?  (I actually
<br>
entertain almost exactly the opposite dread: xenophobia and
<br>
intolerance evolved for a reason, and a hand-over-fist abandonment
<br>
of those impulses will simply result in the abandoners to be
<br>
replaced over time by those less high-minded.)
<br>
<p>Things have been getting better for so long that *complacency*
<br>
is also something I worry about.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  As for your question about how safe one feels, I was
<br>
thinking that I felt safer than ever---until someone pointed
<br>
out that the West really is indeed more vulnerable to terrorist
<br>
attacks than we thought before.  I think that my own sense of
<br>
increased safety simply comes from my repeated acquaintance
<br>
with the fact that I am just one person (in the U.S.) out of
<br>
2.8x10^8 targets, and that despite the way the newspapers
<br>
always dwell on the negative, people who are aware should
<br>
be more and more comfortable with the fact that the negative
<br>
incidents are truly the exception.
