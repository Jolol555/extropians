Emlyn asks
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So my questions are this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 - What do you consider to be extropian, or what do you believe it is to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     an extropian?
</em><br>
<p>Like you, I think the Principles are swell, and state very
<br>
well very much what I believe.  Unlike you, I &lt;choke&gt; hardly
<br>
hold them to be &quot;axiomatic&quot; (whatever you meant by that)!  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2 - Do you consider yourself to be an extropian?
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  I believe in all that.  I don't relate to the
<br>
downsides that you expressed:  I do not care if anyone
<br>
thinks I'm in a cult---if so, the joke is on them.  I am
<br>
not a follower (the thought did not even cross my mind until
<br>
you brought it up):  you don't see me exactly deferring to
<br>
anyone on this list; I'll gladly criticize Max or Natasha
<br>
whenever it seems called for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My personal view is that the extropian principles are all informed by, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be derived from, strong Individualism, which is why I like them.
</em><br>
<p>That is the least attractive part of them to me.  It would
<br>
seem to me that to take as a *principle* self-improvement
<br>
to be, ah, ..., I dunno, too self-absorbed?  No, that's not
<br>
quite it.  Too egotistical?  Again, that's not quite it.
<br>
Too obvious?  Maybe.
<br>
<p>Ah: it's too much a matter of *personal* choice, and so who
<br>
gives a fuck whether or not all the other &quot;extropians&quot; are
<br>
into it.  I think that's it!  For me.
<br>
<p>Lee
