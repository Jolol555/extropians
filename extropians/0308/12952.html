Alex Bokov:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Conformity? You damn well bet... localized, consensual, emergent
<br>
conformity. Also known as consensus. Also known as having a platform. Without
<br>
that, any forum or organization lacks meaning and focus. Luddites are not
<br>
welcome on this list, nor are Flat Earthers, nor are Scientologists. Maybe
<br>
left-wingers and right-wingers shouldn't be welcome either. After all, we
<br>
don't subscribe to NRA or GOP mailing lists and rant about nanouploads, do 
<br>
we?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, for example, for months, all I posted was interesting science stuff, 
<br>
technology; which I would have hoped to be non-ideological, non-polemical. 
<br>
Nobody seems interested. Conformity, will not make you more influential, will not 
<br>
protect you from Luddites. This will only, as I have stated previouly, just 
<br>
turn the list into a mutual admiration society. 
<br>
<p>Maybe if so many on this list would ease back on the narcissism, you might've 
<br>
been able to view the article from Aug 13th, 2003, Reason Magazine, and see 
<br>
that Extropianism was mentioned?

<br>
&lt;&lt;The defining political conflict of the 21st century is shaping up to be the 
<br>
battle over the future of technology. Fortunately, technological progress 
<br>
doesn't just have opponents; it also has boosters. The <A HREF="http://reason.com/0107/fe.rb.rage.shtml">rise of neo-Luddism</A> is 
<br>
calling forth self-conscious defenders of technological progress. Growing numbers 
<br>
of <A HREF="http://www.extropy.org/">extropians</A>, <A HREF="http://www.transhumanism.org/">transhumanists</A>, <A HREF="http://www.futurefoundation.org/">futurists</A> and others are entering the 
<br>
intellectual fray to do battle against the neo-Luddite activists who oppose &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.genetics-and-society.org/index.asp">http://www.genetics-and-society.org/index.asp</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>
biotechnology&lt;/A&gt;, <A HREF="http://www.etcgroup.org/documents/TheBigDown.pdf">nanotechnology</A>, and <A HREF="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/hardware/chips/0,39020354,2083908,00.htm">new intelligence technologies</A>. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>I have come to believe, though have not attempted to bring to this list, 
<br>
before now, the notion that a lot of the smugness some list members possess, seem 
<br>
undeserved.
