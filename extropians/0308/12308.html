<p>Well, (and I do not think my question contained any 
<br>
discourtesy), there is a danger in adhering to highly
<br>
ambitious schemes having to do with highly complex
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>Imagine St. Petersburg in 1917, put yourself back there.
<br>
Given all the evil and corruption in the Czar's
<br>
regime, it would have seemed to many that a worker's
<br>
paradise could be established if only the idealists
<br>
could seize power.  The remarkable thing was that 
<br>
some people were living at the time who knew better,
<br>
or at least sensed it.
<br>
<p>The problem *was* Lenin and his complete revolution.
<br>
(That he himself developed in the early 20's into a
<br>
Stalin and was succeeded by a Stalin is easily
<br>
predictable (just study the course of the French
<br>
revolution). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having seen first hand what the Russian &quot;collective&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society was capable of (e.g. the Moscow subways, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defeat of Hitler's armies, the reliable space program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rocket engines we (in the U.S.) use even today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as Spike admits)) -- the question seems to come back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;what does one get?&quot; and &quot;what does it cost you?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question I would like to ask is &quot;How much of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Russia achieved in so short a span of time could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been achieved without Stalin or Lenin?&quot; [1]
</em><br>
<p>One hell of a lot more without those revolutionary wreckers!
<br>
In 1914, Russia had the most advanced steel mills in all
<br>
Europe, capitalism was firmly rooted, and its science and
<br>
engineering were absolutely first rate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. It is worth understanding that Russia went from essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    a feudal state to a superpower in less than 100 years.
</em><br>
<p>Japan did it in even less time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    Estimates of the combination and Stalin and Hitler on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Russia range from 10 to 100 million lives lost.  One has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    to wonder what might have been accomplished without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    unextropic vector (but under a similar &quot;command&quot; economy)?
</em><br>
<p>In the seven years between 1921 and 1928, the U.S. economy
<br>
grew by forty-nine percent.  And it was solid growth, based
<br>
on trade and massively greater productivity.  The Russian
<br>
economy during the same period fell further and further
<br>
behind their 1914 levels.
<br>
<p>The book &quot;Power and Prosperity&quot; by Mancur Olsen is absolutely
<br>
necessary reading if you want to understand the economic
<br>
successes of Stalin compared to his subsequent replacements
<br>
as heads of the Soviet Union.  He extracted the maximum amount
<br>
of work out of the people by making sure that they didn't 
<br>
&quot;collude&quot; in any way to improve their lives.  This was accomplished
<br>
by incessant purges, which his replacements perhaps just didn't
<br>
have the stomach for.
