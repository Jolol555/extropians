<p>The Probability That a Real-Estate Agent Is Cheating You (and Other Riddles of
<br>
Modern Life) 
<br>
<p>August 3, 2003 By STEPHEN J. DUBNER 
<br>
<p>The most brilliant young economist in America -- the one so deemed, at least, by
<br>
a jury of his elders -- brakes to a stop at a traffic light on Chicago's south
<br>
side. It is a sunny day in mid-June. He drives an aging green Chevy Cavalier
<br>
with a dusty dashboard and a window that doesn't quite shut, producing a dull
<br>
roar at highway speeds. 
<br>
<p>But the car is quiet for now, as are the noontime streets: gas stations,
<br>
boundless concrete, brick buildings with plywood windows. 
<br>
<p>An elderly homeless man approaches. It says he is homeless right on his sign,
<br>
which also asks for money. He wears a torn jacket, too heavy for the warm day,
<br>
and a grimy red baseball cap. 
<br>
<p>The economist doesn't lock his doors or inch the car forward. Nor does he go
<br>
scrounging for spare change. He just watches, as if through one-way glass. After
<br>
a while, the homeless man moves along. 
<br>
<p>''He had nice headphones,'' says the economist, still watching in the rearview
<br>
mirror. ''Well, nicer than the ones I have. Otherwise, it doesn't look like he
<br>
has many assets.'' 
<br>
<p><p>Steven Levitt tends to see things differently than the average person.
<br>
Differently, too, than the average economist. This is either a wonderful trait
<br>
or a troubling one, depending on how you feel about economists. The average
<br>
economist is known to wax oracularly about any and all monetary issues. But if
<br>
you were to ask Levitt his opinion of some standard economic matter, he would
<br>
probably swipe the hair from his eyes and plead ignorance. ''I gave up a long
<br>
time ago pretending that I knew stuff I didn't know,'' he says. ''I mean, I just
<br>
-- I just don't know very much about the field of economics. I'm not good at
<br>
math, I don't know a lot of econometrics, and I also don't know how to do
<br>
theory. If you ask me about whether the stock market's going to go up or down,
<br>
if you ask me whether the economy's going to grow or shrink, if you ask me
<br>
whether deflation's good or bad, if you ask me about taxes -- I mean, it would
<br>
be total fakery if I said I knew anything about any of those things.'' 
<br>
<p>In Levitt's view, economics is a science with excellent tools for gaining
<br>
answers but a serious shortage of interesting questions. His particular gift is
<br>
the ability to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make so much
<br>
money, why do they still live with their mothers? Which is more dangerous, a gun
<br>
or a swimming pool? What really caused crime rates to plunge during the past
<br>
decade? Do real-estate agents have their clients' best interests at heart? Why
<br>
do black parents give their children names that may hurt their career prospects?
<br>
Do schoolteachers cheat to meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling
<br>
corrupt? 
<br>
<p>And how does a homeless man afford $50 headphones? 
<br>
<p>Many people -- including a fair number of his peers -- might not recognize
<br>
Levitt's work as economics at all. But he has merely distilled the so-called
<br>
dismal science down to its most primal aim: explaining how people get what they
<br>
want, or need. Unlike most academics, he is unafraid of using personal
<br>
observations and curiosities (though he does fear calculus). He is an
<br>
intuitionist. He sifts through a pile of data to find a story that no one else
<br>
had found. He devises a way to measure an effect that veteran economists had
<br>
declared unmeasurable. His abiding interests -- though he says he has never
<br>
trafficked in them himself -- are cheating, corruption and crime. 
<br>
<p>His interest in the homeless man's headphones, meanwhile, didn't last long.
<br>
''Maybe,'' he said later, ''it was just testimony to the fact I'm too
<br>
disorganized to buy a set of headphones that I myself covet.'' 
<br>
<p>Levitt is the first to say that some of his topics border on the trivial. But he
<br>
has proved to be such an ingenious researcher and clear-eyed thinker that
<br>
instead of being consigned to the fringe of his field, the opposite has
<br>
happened: he has shown other economists just how well their tools can make sense
<br>
of the real world. 
<br>
<p>''Levitt is considered a demigod, one of the most creative people in economics
<br>
and maybe in all social science,'' says Colin Camerer, an economist at the
<br>
California Institute of Technology. ''He represents something that everyone
<br>
thinks they will be when they go to grad school in econ, but usually they have
<br>
the creative spark bored out of them by endless math -- namely, a kind of
<br>
intellectual detective trying to figure stuff out.'' 
<br>
<p>Levitt is a populist in a field that is undergoing a bout of popularization.
<br>
Undergraduates are swarming the economics departments of elite universities.
<br>
Economics is seen as the ideal blend of intellectual prestige (it does offer a
<br>
Nobel, after all) and practical training for a high-flying finance career
<br>
(unless, like Levitt, you choose to stay in academia). At the same time,
<br>
economics is ever more visible in the real world, thanks to the continuing
<br>
fetishization of the stock market and the continuing fixation with Alan
<br>
Greenspan. 
<br>
<p>The greatest change, however, is within the scholarly ranks. Microeconomists are
<br>
gaining on the macro crowd, empiricists gaining on the theorists. Behavioral
<br>
economists have called into doubt the very notion of ''homo economicus,'' the
<br>
supposedly rational decision-maker in each of us. Young economists of every
<br>
stripe are more inclined to work on real-world subjects and dip into bordering
<br>
disciplines -- psychology, criminology, sociology, even neurology -- with the
<br>
intent of rescuing their science from its slavish dependence upon mathematical
<br>
models. 
<br>
<p>Levitt fits everywhere and nowhere. He is a noetic butterfly that no one has
<br>
pinned down -- he was once offered a job on the Clinton economic team, and the
<br>
Bush campaign approached him about being a crime adviser -- but who is widely
<br>
appreciated. 
<br>
<p>''Steve isn't really a behavioral economist, but they'd be happy to have him,''
<br>
says Austan Goolsbee, who teaches economics at the University of Chicago's
<br>
Graduate School of Business. ''He's not really an old price-theory guy, but
<br>
these Chicago guys are happy to claim him. He's not really a Cambridge guy'' --
<br>
although Levitt went to Harvard and then M.I.T. -- ''but they'd love him to come
<br>
back.'' 
<br>
<p>He has critics, to be sure. Daniel Hamermesh, a prominent labor economist at the
<br>
University of Texas, has taught Levitt's paper ''The Impact of Legalized
<br>
Abortion on Crime'' to his undergraduates. ''I've gone over this paper in draft,
<br>
in its printed version, at great length, and for the life of me I can't see
<br>
anything wrong with it,'' Hamermesh says. ''On the other hand, I don't believe a
<br>
word of it. And his stuff on sumo wrestlers -- well, this is not exactly
<br>
fundamental, unless you're Japanese and weigh 500 pounds.'' 
<br>
<p>But at 36, Levitt is a full professor in the University of Chicago's economics
<br>
department, the most legendary program in the country. (He received tenure after
<br>
only two years.) He is an editor of The Journal of Political Economy, a leading
<br>
journal in the field. And the American Economic Association recently awarded him
<br>
its John Bates Clark Medal, given biennially to the country's best economist
<br>
under 40. 
<br>
<p><p>He is a prolific and diverse writer. But his paper linking a rise in abortion to
<br>
a drop in crime has made more noise than the rest combined. Levitt and his
<br>
co-author, John Donohue of Stanford Law School, argued that as much as 50
<br>
percent of the huge drop in crime since the early 1990's can be traced to Roe v.
<br>
Wade. Their thinking goes like this: the women most likely to seek an abortion
<br>
-- poor, single, black or teenage mothers -- were the very women whose children,
<br>
if born, have been shown most likely to become criminals. But since those
<br>
children weren't born, crime began to decrease during the years they would have
<br>
entered their criminal prime. In conversation, Levitt reduces the theory to a
<br>
tidy syllogism: ''Unwantedness leads to high crime; abortion leads to less
<br>
unwantedness; abortion leads to less crime.'' 
<br>
<p>Levitt had already published widely about crime and punishment. One paper he
<br>
wrote as a graduate student is still regularly cited. His question was
<br>
disarmingly simple: Do more police translate into less crime? The answer would
<br>
seem obvious -- yes -- but had never been proved: since the number of police
<br>
officers tends to rise along with the number of crimes, the effectiveness of the
<br>
police was tricky to measure. 
<br>
<p>Levitt needed a mechanism that would unlink the crime rate from police hiring.
<br>
He found it within politics. He noticed that mayors and governors running for
<br>
re-election often hire more police officers. By measuring those police increases
<br>
against crime rates, he was able to determine that additional officers do indeed
<br>
bring down violent crime. 
<br>
<p>That paper was later disputed -- another graduate student found a serious
<br>
mathematical mistake in it -- but Levitt's ingenuity was obvious. He began to be
<br>
acknowledged as a master of the simple, clever solution. He was the guy who, in
<br>
the slapstick scene, sees all the engineers futzing with a broken machine -- and
<br>
then realizes that no one has thought to plug it in. 
<br>
<p>Arguing that the police help deter crime didn't make Levitt any enemies. Arguing
<br>
that abortion deterred crime was another matter. 
<br>
<p>In the abortion paper, published in 2001, he and Donohue warned that their
<br>
findings should not be seen ''as either an endorsement of abortion or a call for
<br>
intervention by the state in the fertility decisions of women.'' They suggested
<br>
that crime might just as easily be curbed by ''providing better environments for
<br>
those children at greatest risk for future crime.'' 
<br>
<p>Still, the very topic managed to offend nearly everyone. Conservatives were
<br>
enraged that abortion could be construed as a crime-fighting tool. Liberals were
<br>
aghast that poor and black women were singled out. Economists grumbled that
<br>
Levitt's methodology was not sound. A syllogism, after all, can be a magic
<br>
trick: All cats die; Socrates died; therefore Socrates was a cat. 
<br>
<p>''I think he's enormously clever in so many areas, focusing very much on the
<br>
issue of reverse causality,'' says Ted Joyce, an economist at Baruch College who
<br>
has written a critical response to the abortion paper. ''But in this case I
<br>
think he ignored it, or didn't tend to it well enough.'' 
<br>
<p>As the news media gorged on the abortion-crime story, Levitt came under direct
<br>
assault. He was called an ideologue (by conservatives and liberals alike), a
<br>
eugenicist, a racist and downright evil. 
<br>
<p>In reality, he seems to be very much none of those. He has little taste for
<br>
politics and less for moralizing. He is genial, low-key and unflappable,
<br>
confident but not cocky. He is a respected teacher and colleague; he is a
<br>
sought-after collaborator who, because of the breadth of his curiosities, often
<br>
works with scholars outside his field -- another rarity for an economist. 
<br>
<p>''I hesitate to use these words, but Steve is a con man, in the best sense,''
<br>
says Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociologist at Columbia University. ''He's the
<br>
Shakespearean jester. He'll make you believe his ideas were yours.'' Venkatesh
<br>
was Levitt's co-author on ''An Economic Analysis of a Drug-Selling Gang's
<br>
Finances,'' which found that the average street dealer lives with his mother
<br>
because the take-home pay is, frankly, terrible. The paper analyzed one crack
<br>
gang's financial activities as if it were any corporation. (It was Venkatesh who
<br>
procured the data, from a former gang member.) Such a thing had never been
<br>
tried. ''This lack of focus,'' Levitt deadpanned in one version of the paper,
<br>
''is perhaps partly attributable to the fact that few economists have been
<br>
involved in the study of gangs.'' 
<br>
<p>Levitt speaks with a boyish lisp. His appearance is High Nerd: a plaid
<br>
button-down shirt, nondescript khakis and a braided belt, sensible shoes. His
<br>
pocket calendar is branded with the National Bureau of Economic Research logo.
<br>
''I wish he would get more than three haircuts a year,'' his wife, Jeannette,
<br>
says, ''and that he wasn't still wearing the same glasses he got 15 years ago,
<br>
which weren't even in fashion then.'' He was a good golfer in high school but
<br>
has so physically atrophied that he calls himself ''the weakest human being
<br>
alive'' and asks Jeannette to open jars around the house. 
<br>
<p>There is nothing in his appearance or manner, in other words, that suggests a
<br>
flamethrower. He will tell you that all he does is sit at his desk, day and
<br>
night, wrestling with some strange mountain of data. He will tell you that he
<br>
would do it free (his salary is reportedly more than $200,000), and you tend to
<br>
believe him. He may be an accidental provocateur, but he is a provocateur
<br>
nonetheless. 
<br>
<p>He takes particular delight in catching wrongdoers. In one paper, he devised a
<br>
set of algorithms that could identify teachers in the Chicago public-school
<br>
system who were cheating. ''Cheating classrooms will systematically differ from
<br>
other classrooms along a number of dimensions,'' he and his co-author, Brian
<br>
Jacob of the Kennedy School of Government, wrote in ''Catching Cheating
<br>
Teachers.'' ''For instance, students in cheating classrooms are likely to
<br>
experience unusually large test-score gains in the year of the cheating,
<br>
followed by unusually small gains or even declines in the following year when
<br>
the boost attributable to cheating disappears.'' 
<br>
<p>Levitt used test-score data from the Chicago schools that had long been
<br>
available to other researchers. There were a number of ways, he realized, that a
<br>
teacher could cheat. If she were particularly brazen (and stupid), she might
<br>
give students the correct answers. Or, after the test, she might actually erase
<br>
students' wrong answers and fill in correct ones. A sophisticated cheater would
<br>
be careful to avoid conspicuous blocks of identical answers. But Levitt was more
<br>
sophisticated. ''The first step in analyzing suspicious strings is to estimate
<br>
the probability each child would give a particular answer on each question,'' he
<br>
wrote. ''This estimation is done using a multinomial logit framework with past
<br>
test scores, demographics and socioeconomic characteristics as explanatory
<br>
variables.'' 
<br>
<p>So by measuring any number of factors -- the difficulty of a particular
<br>
question, the frequency with which students got hard questions right and easy
<br>
ones wrong, the degree to which certain answers were highly correlated in one
<br>
classroom -- Levitt identified which teachers he thought were cheating. (Perhaps
<br>
just as valuable, he was also able to identify the good teachers.) The Chicago
<br>
school system, rather than disputing Levitt's findings, invited him into the
<br>
schools for retesting. As a result, the cheaters were fired. 
<br>
<p>Then there is his coming ''Understanding Why Crime Fell in the 1990's: Four
<br>
Factors That Explain the Decline and Seven That Do Not.'' The entire drop in
<br>
crime, Levitt says, was due to more police officers, more prisoners, the waning
<br>
crack epidemic and Roe v. Wade. 
<br>
<p>One factor that probably didn't make a difference, he argues, was the innovative
<br>
policing strategy trumpeted in New York by Rudolph Giuliani and William Bratton. 
<br>
<p>''I think,'' Levitt says, ''I'm pretty much alone in saying that.'' 
<br>
<p>He comes from a Minneapolis family of high, if unusual, achievers. His father, a
<br>
medical researcher, is considered a leading authority on intestinal gas. (He
<br>
bills himself as ''The Man Who Gave Status to Flatus and Class to Gas.'') One of
<br>
Levitt's great uncles, Robert May, wrote ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' --
<br>
the book, that is; another great uncle, Johnny Marks, later wrote the song. 
<br>
<p>At Harvard, Levitt wrote his senior thesis on thoroughbred breeding and
<br>
graduated summa cum laude. (He is still obsessed with horse racing. He says he
<br>
believes it is corrupt and has designed a betting system -- the details of which
<br>
he will not share -- to take advantage of the corruption.) He worked for two
<br>
years as a management consultant before enrolling at M.I.T. for a doctorate in
<br>
economics. The M.I.T. program was famous for its mathematical intensity. Levitt
<br>
had taken exactly one math course as an undergraduate and had forgotten even
<br>
that. During his first graduate class, he asked the student next to him about a
<br>
formula on the board: Is there any difference between the derivative sign that's
<br>
straight up-and-down and the curly one? ''You are in so much trouble,'' he was
<br>
told. 
<br>
<p>''People wrote him off,'' recalls Austan Goolsbee, the Chicago economist who was
<br>
then a classmate. ''They'd say, 'That guy has no future.''' 
<br>
<p>Levitt set his own course. Other grad students stayed up all night working on
<br>
problem sets, trying to make good grades. He stayed up researching and writing.
<br>
''My view was that the way you succeed in this profession is you write great
<br>
papers,'' he says. ''So I just started.'' 
<br>
<p>Sometimes he would begin with a question. Sometimes it was a set of data that
<br>
caught his eye. He spent one entire summer typing into his computer the results
<br>
of years' worth of Congressional elections. (Today, with so much information so
<br>
easily available on the Internet, Levitt complains that he can't get his
<br>
students to input data at all.) All he had was a vague curiosity about why
<br>
incumbents were so often re-elected. 
<br>
<p>Then he happened upon a political-science book whose authors claimed that money
<br>
wins elections, period. ''They were trying to explain election outcomes as a
<br>
function of campaign expenditures,'' he recalls, ''completely ignoring the fact
<br>
that contributors will only give money to challengers when they have a realistic
<br>
chance of winning, and incumbents only spend a lot when they have a chance of
<br>
losing. They convinced themselves this was the causal story even though it's so
<br>
obvious in retrospect that it's a spurious effect.'' 
<br>
<p>Obvious, at least, to Levitt. Within five minutes, he had a vision of the paper
<br>
he would write. ''It came to me,'' he says, ''in full bloom.'' 
<br>
<p>The problem was that his data couldn't tell him who was a good candidate and who
<br>
wasn't. It was therefore impossible to tease out the effect of the money. As
<br>
with the police/crime rate puzzle, he had to trick the data. 
<br>
<p>Because he himself had typed in the data, he had noticed something: often, the
<br>
same two candidates faced each other multiple times. By analyzing the data from
<br>
only those elections, Levitt was able to find a true result. His conclusion:
<br>
campaign money has about one-tenth the impact as was commonly accepted. 
<br>
<p>An unknown graduate student, he sent his paper to The Journal of Political
<br>
Economy -- one professor told him he was crazy for even trying -- where it was
<br>
published. He completed his Ph.D. in three years, but because of his priorities,
<br>
he says, he was ''invisible'' to the faculty, ''a real zero.'' Then he stumbled
<br>
upon what he now calls the turning point in his career. 
<br>
<p>He had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the venerable intellectual
<br>
Harvard clubhouse that pays young scholars to do their own work, for three
<br>
years, with no commitments. Levitt felt he didn't stand a chance. For starters,
<br>
he didn't consider himself an intellectual. He would be interviewed over dinner
<br>
by the senior fellows, a collection of world-renowned philosophers, scientists
<br>
and historians. He worried he wouldn't have enough conversation for even the
<br>
first course. 
<br>
<p>Instead, he was on fire. Whatever subject came up -- the brain, ants, philosophy
<br>
-- he just happened to remember something pithy he'd read. His wit crackled as
<br>
it had never crackled before. When he told them about the two summers he spent
<br>
betting the horses back in Minnesota, they ate it up! 
<br>
<p><p>Finally -- disquietingly -- one of them said: ''I'm having a hard time seeing
<br>
the unifying theme of your work. Could you explain it?'' 
<br>
<p>Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme was, or if he even
<br>
had one. 
<br>
<p>Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in and neatly summarized
<br>
what he saw as Levitt's theme. 
<br>
<p>Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that's my theme. 
<br>
<p>Another fellow then offered another theme. 
<br>
<p>You're right, Levitt said, that's my theme. 
<br>
<p>And so it went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher Robert Nozick
<br>
interrupted. If Levitt could have been said to have an intellectual hero, it
<br>
would be Nozick. 
<br>
<p>''How old are you, Steve?'' he asked. 
<br>
<p>''Twenty-six.'' 
<br>
<p><p>Nozick turned to the other fellows: ''He's 26 years old. Why does he need to
<br>
have a unifying theme? Maybe he's going to be one of those people who's so
<br>
talented he doesn't need one. He'll take a question and he'll just answer it,
<br>
and it'll be fine.'' 
<br>
<p>The University of Chicago's economics department had a famous unifying theme --
<br>
the Gospel of Free Markets, with a conservative twist -- and would therefore not
<br>
have seemed the most likely fit for Levitt. As he sees it, Chicago is about
<br>
theory, deep thinking and big ideas, while he is about empiricism, clever
<br>
thinking and ''cute but ultimately insubstantial ideas.'' 
<br>
<p>But Chicago also had Gary Becker. To Levitt, Becker is the most influential
<br>
economist of the past 50 years. Long before it was fashionable, Becker brought
<br>
microeconomic theory to offbeat topics, the family and crime in particular. For
<br>
years, Becker was demonized -- a single phrase like ''the price of children''
<br>
would set off untold alarms. ''I took a lot of heat over my career from people
<br>
who thought my work was silly or irrelevant or not economics,'' Becker says. But
<br>
Chicago supported him; he persevered, winning the Nobel Prize in 1992; and he
<br>
became Steven Levitt's role model. 
<br>
<p>Becker told Levitt that Chicago would be a great environment for him. ''Not
<br>
everybody agrees with all your results,'' he said, ''but we agree what you're
<br>
doing is very interesting work, and we'll support you in that.'' 
<br>
<p>Levitt soon found that the support at Chicago went beyond the scholarly. The
<br>
year after he was hired, his wife gave birth to their first child, Andrew. One
<br>
day, just after Andrew turned a year old, he came down with a slight fever. The
<br>
doctor diagnosed an ear infection. When he started vomiting the next morning,
<br>
his parents took him to the hospital. A few days later he was dead of
<br>
pneumococcal meningitis. 
<br>
<p>Amid the shock and grief, Levitt had an undergraduate class that needed
<br>
teaching. It was Gary Becker -- a Nobel laureate nearing his 70th birthday --
<br>
who sat in for him. Another colleague, D. Gale Johnson, sent a condolence card
<br>
that Levitt still quotes from memory. 
<br>
<p>Levitt and Johnson, an agricultural economist in his 80's, began speaking
<br>
regularly. Levitt learned that Johnson's daughter was one of the first Americans
<br>
to adopt a daughter from China. Soon the Levitts adopted a daughter of their
<br>
own, whom they named Amanda. In addition to Amanda, they have since had a
<br>
daughter, now almost 3, and a son. But Andrew's death has played on, in various
<br>
ways. They have become close friends with the family of the little girl to whom
<br>
they donated Andrew's liver. (They also donated his heart, but that baby died.)
<br>
And not surprisingly for a scholar who pursues real-life subjects, the death
<br>
also informed Levitt's work. 
<br>
<p>He and Jeannette joined a support group for grieving parents. Levitt was struck
<br>
by how many children had drowned in swimming pools. They were the kinds of
<br>
deaths that don't make the newspaper -- unlike, for instance, a child who dies
<br>
while playing with a gun. 
<br>
<p>Levitt was curious and went looking for numbers that would tell the story. He
<br>
wrote up the results as an op-ed article for The Chicago Sun-Times. It featured
<br>
the sort of plangent counterintuition for which he has become famous: ''If you
<br>
own a gun and have a swimming pool in the yard, the swimming pool is almost 100
<br>
times more likely to kill a child than the gun is.'' 
<br>
<p>Trying to get his mind off death, Levitt took up a hobby: rehabbing and selling
<br>
old houses in Oak Park, where he lives. This experience has led to yet another
<br>
paper, about the real-estate market. It is his most Chicago-style paper yet, a
<br>
romp in price theory, a sign that the university's influence on him is perhaps
<br>
as strong as his influence on it. But Levitt being Levitt, it also deals with
<br>
corruption. 
<br>
<p><p>While negotiating to buy old houses, he found that the seller's agent often
<br>
encouraged him, albeit cagily, to underbid. This seemed odd: didn't the agent
<br>
represent the seller's best interest? Then he thought more about the agent's
<br>
role. Like many other ''experts'' (auto mechanics and stockbrokers come to
<br>
mind), a real-estate agent is thought to know his field far better than a lay
<br>
person. A homeowner is encouraged to trust the agent's information. So if the
<br>
agent brings in a low offer and says it might just be the best the homeowner can
<br>
expect, the homeowner tends to believe him. But the key, Levitt determined, lay
<br>
in the fact that agents ''receive only a small share of the incremental profit
<br>
when a house sells for a higher value.'' Like a stockbroker churning commissions
<br>
or a bookie grabbing his vig, an agent was simply looking to make a deal, any
<br>
deal. So he would push homeowners to sell too fast and too cheap. 
<br>
<p>Now if Levitt could only measure this effect. Once again, he found a clever
<br>
mechanism. Using data from more than 
<br>
50,000 home sales in Cook County, Ill., he compared the figures for homes owned
<br>
by real-estate agents with those for homes for which they acted only as agents.
<br>
The agents' homes stayed on the market about 10 days longer and sold for 2
<br>
percent more. 
<br>
<p><p>Late on a summer afternoon, Levitt is in his office, deep inside one of the
<br>
university's Gothic behemoths. The ceiling is stained, the plaster around the
<br>
window crumbling. He is just back from sabbatical at Stanford, and his desk is a
<br>
holy mess: stacks of books and journals, a green sippy cup and a little orange
<br>
squeeze hippo. 
<br>
<p>This is his afternoon to meet with students. Levitt drinks a Mountain Dew and
<br>
talks softly. Some students come for research assignments, some for advice. One
<br>
has just written her undergraduate thesis: ''The Labor Market Consequence of
<br>
Graduating College in a Bad Economy.'' For a thesis, Levitt tells her, it's very
<br>
good. But now she wants to have it published. 
<br>
<p>''You write like a college student, and that's a problem,'' he says. ''The thing
<br>
is, you're telling a story. There's foreshadowing going on, all those tricks.
<br>
You want the reader going down a particular path so when they get the results,
<br>
they understand them and believe them. But you also want to be honest about your
<br>
weaknesses. People are much less harsh on weaknesses that are clear than
<br>
weaknesses that are hidden -- as they should be.'' 
<br>
<p>Be honest about your weaknesses. Has there ever been a prize-winning scholar as
<br>
honest about his weaknesses as Steven Levitt? He doesn't understand economics,
<br>
he claims, or math. He's a little thinker in a world of big thinkers. He can't
<br>
even open a jar of spaghetti sauce at home, poor guy. 
<br>
<p>Friends say that Levitt's self-deprecation is as calculated as it is genuine.
<br>
Within academia, economists take pride in being the most cutthroat of a
<br>
cutthroat breed. Anyone who writes papers on ''Weakest Link'' (contestants
<br>
discriminate against Latino and elderly peers, Levitt concluded, but not blacks
<br>
or women) and sumo (to best manage their tournament rankings, wrestlers often
<br>
conspire to throw matches) had better not also be arrogant. 
<br>
<p>Or maybe it is not self-deprecation at all. Maybe it is self-flagellation. Maybe
<br>
what Steven Levitt really wants is to graduate from his ''silly'' and
<br>
''trivial'' and ''shallow'' topics. 
<br>
<p>He thinks he's onto something with a new paper about black names. He wanted to
<br>
know if someone with a distinctly black name suffers an economic penalty. His
<br>
answer -- contrary to other recent research -- is no. But now he has a bigger
<br>
question: Is black culture a cause of racial inequality or
