Yes, there are plenty of antecedents to transhumanism. It would be a 
<br>
mistake to assume that it all started with Max More or FM 2020. The FAQ 
<br>
contains a partial list of forerunners 
<br>
(<a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/faq.html#View">http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/faq.html#View</a>). It mentions 
<br>
Condorcet but not Fourier. 
<br>
<p>Do we need to be a new philosophy? No, just as we do not need to be an 
<br>
old philosophy. We just need to be a good philosophy that works. This is 
<br>
maybe where transhumanism

<p>So in what way are we misreading predecessors? You do not give any
<br>
examples, just suggestive quotes that they &quot;had the same ideas&quot; (or
<br>
rather, have ideas similar to the ones we develop in the light of

current knowledge and ideas).

<p><em>&gt; Also, using the structure of an &quot;institute&quot; / &quot;school of philosophy&quot; is a

</em><br>
<p>A school of philosophy is just a group of people sharing many views, 
<br>
which may or may not form a well-defined philosophical system. Aren't 
<br>
you aiming at the issue of whether transhumanism can be viewed as a true

philosophical system (with parts such as metaphysics, epistemology, 
<br>
ethics and politics) rather than the structure of transhumanist

organisations?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rejoice! You are not an extropian, you are a materialist ! :-)
</em><br>
<p>But what kind of materialist? Marxist materialist? Epicurean 
<br>
materialist? Reductive or eliminative materialist? That I am a 
<br>
materialist does not tell much about my ethics, my ideas of what 
<br>
constitutes the good life, my ideas of how knowledge can be acquired and 
<br>
applied. Saying extropianism is just materialism is like saying it is 
<br>
just optimism - it takes a part (which is not even essential, since 
<br>
there are Christian extropians who presumably are not materialists) and 
<br>
says it is all.
