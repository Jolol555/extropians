</em><br>
<p>I haven't yet been to an Extro. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But distributing ones intelligence across light years makes it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially &quot;impossible&quot; for Lee to function as a connected

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;good&quot; of the very loosely connected collective.
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;collectively&quot;, I meant &quot;summed over all entities with Leeness&quot;.
<br>
Note that I'm sure that Lee can defend his own point of view better
<br>
than I can, and I only mentioned it as an example of how these
<br>
discussions seem to go off track. :)  It appears that I shouldn't
<br>
have used the term &quot;collectively&quot;, since it's so close to the
<br>
term &quot;collectivist&quot;, which isn't what I intended.  Nor was it the
<br>
case that I believe that Lee is interested (in this case) in
<br>
distributing intelligence across lightyears.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That is, creating Lee II is a way to get more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; run time for Lee I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't happen to agree with that, but losing track of what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; been said before is exceptionally unproductive in these threads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, the point I have been trying to make (it seems like over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and over again) is that Lee II *cannot* provide any &quot;return
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on investment&quot; to Lee I.
</em><br>
<p>The thing you're missing here, Robert, is that Lee I doesn't care
<br>
(totally, at least) about ROI to Lee I, but about benefit to any
<br>
person who is Lee, anywhere.  Or, hey, maybe I misunderstood Lee,
<br>
and you're right. :)  Only The Corbin can say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only reason that Lee I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create Lee II is out of some desire to propagate and Lee I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would know that propagation eventually has negative consequences.
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't matter that propagation eventually has negative
<br>
consequences, *unless* you can prevent all propagation
<br>
by anyone, anywhere.  If anyone propagates, they will be
<br>
disproportionately the ones that get to deal with the
<br>
resulting problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If they had started with the assumption that GB or Spain would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; eventually be defeated by *someone*, they might very well have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chosen to deliberately create the next set of winners.  You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; prevent North America (or the intergalactic space) from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; colonized, but you can try to choose what sort do the colonization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps.  Most people do not act out of a desire to produce their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacements.
</em><br>
<p>This is clearly not the case.  Seen parents, much?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sure you can have evolutionary drives but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any advanced civilization will have regulated those drives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (witness the declining populations in Japan and Europe).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now one might produce &quot;offspring&quot; if it were clear that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not going to compete with you (i.e. the children of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced civilizations exit from the galaxy due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperature and thermodynamics reasons I have suggested).
</em><br>
<p>A civilization that successfully regulates its own growth, but
<br>
not that of others, if any, will not be highly represented at
<br>
a given late date.  Even if humans are the only existing
<br>
intelligences (and I would guess that we are), I see no reason
<br>
why there wouldn't be escapees.
