<em>&gt; Better for whom?
</em><br>
<p>Good points, all.
<br>
<p>Here's a brief response:
<br>
<p>Better would have to be defined as &quot;amount of time the average person 
<br>
had to work to pay for their own subsistence, relative to the amount of 
<br>
time they were able to spend on the rest of, say, maslow's hierarchy of 
<br>
needs.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is, let's define quality of life as the ability to bypass the 
<br>
subsistence level of living &quot;plus sex&quot;.  We'll define &quot;most&quot; purely 
<br>
percentage wise.
<br>
<p>I don't know ALL the details, but here's what I do know.  The relative 
<br>
chunk that &quot;upstream pyramid&quot; people take is relatively the same now as 
<br>
in 1900 &quot;for most people&quot; given that still, &quot;most people&quot; live in bleak 
<br>
poverty with little hope of moving past caring for their basic needs 
<br>
plus sex.
<br>
<p>If you restrict &quot;most people&quot; to the united states, we can all agree 
<br>
that pre-slavery US was morally intolerable, but on the pure numbers, 
<br>
with slaves making up less than 10% of the overall population, while 
<br>
they had a tendency to drag the averages down, they didn't do it any 
<br>
worse than the poverty-level people of today.  (And I am DEFINITELY NOT 
<br>
blaming them for bringing the &quot;average quality of living&quot; down.)
<br>
<p>As for women's suffrage, this clearly enabled fully half of our 
<br>
citizenry to potentially exercise one of the major rights of 
<br>
self-determination, the empirical question though is whether the 
<br>
overall effect was to give women and men together more 
<br>
leisure/self-improvement time or give them all equally, less time, and 
<br>
whether or not in fact more people were empowered politically by the 
<br>
movement.  I think both of those questions are objectively open.  It's 
<br>
not clear that with 20% of the people in the country continuing to 
<br>
control 90% of the resources that self-determination was served by 
<br>
women's suffrage (though once again the right to vote being denied was 
<br>
a morally intolerable state of affairs).
<br>
<p>If there were any major improvements in the last 200-hundred years with 
<br>
objectively correlate-able effects to overall average improvements in 
<br>
leisure-time/self-improvement-time they were:
<br>
<p>1)  The 40-hour work week.
<br>
2)  The minimum wage
<br>
3)  The child labor laws
<br>
4)  The unionization laws
<br>
<p>Remembering that &quot;most&quot; eg 50% or more of the people are poverty-level 
<br>
and the next largest group are &quot;middle class&quot; the top 10% tend to not 
<br>
matter very much when doing calculations of overall improvement in the 
<br>
quality of life.  This means that major medical advances (heart 
<br>
transplants, curing glaucoma, etc.) tend not to matter very much in the 
<br>
equation.  Indeed, it's hard to see how the life of King George II was 
<br>
much worse than Queen Elizabeth's or whether how an 18th-century-duke's 
<br>
life compared to Bill Gates &quot;matters in the long run&quot;.  The things that 
<br>
matter tend to be large-scale changes in the ways that people interact 
<br>
- paradigm shifts in how people are treated by each other.  And these 
<br>
changes tend to be power-shifts from centralized to democratized 
<br>
control.  (The ancient addage that people are too stupid to govern 
<br>
themselves having been given the lie by empirical evidence over the 
<br>
last 2500 years).
<br>
<p>I would argue that these paradigm shifts tend to have the greatest 
<br>
overall and specific effects as well - with more average leisure-time, 
<br>
more effort is put into self-realization and likely neo-extropic 
<br>
activities (researching glaucoma) and because some of these problems 
<br>
are so intractable (like beating despotism worlwide) it takes a LOT of 
<br>
effort to make them happen, requiring a lot of parts of everyone's 
<br>
days.  I take it it's axiomatic that life-enhancement for the rich is 
<br>
not the primary concern of extropianism and even if it is the creation 
<br>
of a sustainable society should be one of the key elements in that 
<br>
concern.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
