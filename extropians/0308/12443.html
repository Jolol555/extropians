Robert writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert Freitas has made documented arguments on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages to sending probes rather than radio signals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [And when Robert F. talks I tend to try and listen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closely.]
</em><br>
<p>Bill Frantz, who used to work at my company, once
<br>
famously quipped, &quot;never underestimate the bandwidth
<br>
of a 747 loaded with mag tape&quot;.  Yes, I can understand
<br>
that when you send matter, you send a hell of a lot of
<br>
bits.  Is this what is meant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've thought about the &quot;broadcast&quot; perspective --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have to setup a very large &quot;grid&quot; of parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high power laser transmitters then on the receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side you need an even larger grid of receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; telescopes.  And that is even to get some small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of the information content of a system.
</em><br>
<p>All right.  Well, I think that my argument works
<br>
either way.  No one will move.  One may send a lot
<br>
of data (including algorithms/programs) either
<br>
physically or by transmission.  Some of this data
<br>
may constitute part of the identity of the sender.
<br>
No one will move because---as you imply---no one
<br>
can move.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, so (as we agree in the subsequent part of your email),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eventually the &quot;stay at homes&quot; could fall behind technologically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but you seem to be assuming that there are no technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits.  I've read a fair amount of literature on the physics of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation, nanotechnology, etc. and there *are* limits.  (The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper that Anders published in JET several years ago documents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a number of these.)
</em><br>
<p>So you are suggesting that intra-galactic civilizations quickly
<br>
reach limits, and inter-galactic civilizations quickly reach limits,
<br>
it's just that the latter are more advanced than the former.
<br>
<p>(My own intuitions have not caught up to this: it still seems to
<br>
me that lots of good old fashioned atoms, e.g., the kind you find
<br>
inside galaxies in droves, are very handy for computation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; what stays here stays here, and I transmit as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible (copying, *not* moving) of myself to the least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amount of matter than we have to send to constitute a receiver.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But *why* would you create Lee II when Lee II cannot significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit Lee I and Lee II (and Lee II's offspring) could potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be competing against you for resources when they start getting scarce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the universe?
</em><br>
<p>Well, IMO those resources are going to be used by *somebody*.
<br>
If it's not a Lee II then it will be a Robert II, or, shudder,
<br>
a Samantha II.  I anticipate that I'll probably get along
<br>
better with Lee II's than with future versions of other people,
<br>
or, more seriously, future versions of ambitious *aliens*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have to create an &quot;enslaved&quot; Lee II that is permanently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loyal to Lee I which means that its usefullness is limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you have to limit its freedom to evolve.
</em><br>
<p>Enslavement at such a remove is either ridiculous or impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would Great Britian or Spain have allowed the colonization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. if they could have anticipated the creation of a nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would defeat them in various wars?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, in hindsight, the creation of a country in North
<br>
America quite similar culturally to England was a very wise
<br>
move.  The Americans rescued English bacon from the 1700's
<br>
through the present.  (Okay, there was a minor tiff in 1812.)
<br>
France and Germany can well regret that they were not active
<br>
in the colonization business, and Sweden can only lament that
<br>
they did not build a great and powerful Swedish colony all
<br>
thoughout North America as they could easily have done in
<br>
the 1600s. Then the world would probably be speaking Swedish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But you have not explained why creatures more advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than we are could not be living right here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm... I thought I had.  The local environment is inhospitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the creation of optimal computing structures (at least of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one type that I have envisioned).
</em><br>
<p>Ha! Classic mis-communication.  I mean to assert only that *we*
<br>
presently have not reached any maximum.  M-brains or Jupiter
<br>
brains, as you uniquely well know, could be vastly vastly VASTLY
<br>
more intelligent than we are.  I do not see any reason why this
<br>
local region of space won't host such creatures in 3000 A.D.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You simply *cannot* do it &quot;here&quot; without disassembling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; galaxy.  Even if that were feasible, in the universe, as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is currently structured, it is much cheaper to simply leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a galaxy.
</em><br>
<p>Again, *moving* is extremely hard!  The most you can do is
<br>
send an infinitesimal part of yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What may be of more interest from a longer term perspective are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety and security.  You are still thinking from a &quot;natural&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution point of view -- i.e. &quot;I have to replicate (copy)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself&quot;.  You have not made the transition to the &quot;directed&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution point of view -- i.e. &quot;What is best for my long term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-preservation and/or development?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think that I have appreciated how evolution will become
<br>
self-directed.  Logically, there is (1) safety in numbers, (2)
<br>
safety in high rates of reproduction.  This definitely
<br>
includes directed evolution.  If singularity-type structures
<br>
(or even M-brains) get going in the solar system, they'll
<br>
definitely want to send spoors to nearby stars---or some of
<br>
them will (and, I repeat, it only takes one).  As millions
<br>
of spoors take off from here and from other nearby stars, 
<br>
evolution kicks in and those that replicate best and at
<br>
the most advanced level predominate.  It's all Darwinian.
<br>
