X9987ghy7Q writes---channeling through the Simulated Human
<br>
Being (SHB) Brent Thomas---
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems clear to me [X9987ghy7Q] that as a civilization advances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and increases its available computing power a larger and larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portion of that available power is used in simulation. Simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics, of environments, of creatures and yes of detailed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional creatures in environments. Creatures such as ourselves?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeed, simulations of us too.  However, it is in my opinion
<br>
rather complicated.  Let me explain (summarizing many past posts).
<br>
<p>In the first place, our infinite universe at levels 1, 2, and 3
<br>
(see Tegmark) runs infinitely many copies of us.  Therefore our
<br>
current experience---as you explain---is not only being simulated
<br>
infinitely many times, but actually *occurs* in physical space
<br>
infinitely many times.
<br>
<p>In order to keep the word &quot;infinitely&quot; from making the text less
<br>
comprehensible, allow me to confine this discussion to a suitably
<br>
large, but finite space on level 1, say one trillion light years.
<br>
<p>Now whenever we use the words &quot;this solar system&quot;, the word
<br>
&quot;this&quot; does not have the unambiguous meaning that one may at
<br>
first suppose.  After all, in our sphere of a trillion light
<br>
year there could be many simulated versions of me or you in
<br>
identical states saying &quot;this&quot;, and a few real versions too.
<br>
<p>So it is proper to identify with *all* your copies who at this
<br>
moment within the trillion light year sphere who are saying
<br>
&quot;this&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, we may choose to *mean* this here in the sense of &quot;this
<br>
here physical&quot; solar system, thus confining attention to only
<br>
the real physical processes.  Remember, all the simulations
<br>
and physical processes are completely identical, so therefore,
<br>
I claim, WE MIGHT AS WELL BE REFERRING TO THE PHYSICALLY REAL
<br>
ONE.
<br>
<p>(It does so simplify the language, as does dropping &quot;infinitely
<br>
many&quot; from each sentence did.  Besides, the simulations have many
<br>
aspects to them that are true but which are unavailable to us,
<br>
and they come in many varieties, as I will now show.)
<br>
<p>In the second place, let us for the moment allow &quot;this&quot; to
<br>
point to one of the simulations.  In this case, we have to
<br>
ask how many of us are in this simulation.  Only the people
<br>
reading this list?  Or all six billion humans?  Or just you?
<br>
Or just me?
<br>
<p>Now if it is all humans---which is the usual default assumption
<br>
when people start going on about simulations---then note that
<br>
our simulators are cruel indeed.  The bastards have bothered
<br>
to simulate the collapse of the World Trade Center, the 
<br>
Cambodian holocaust, and even the people rotting in Castro's
<br>
jails.  Why?  What on Earth would motivate them TO *DO* THIS?
<br>
One does not have to go as far as Samantha and several others
<br>
do to assume that advanced races are vastly nicer than we are;
<br>
if they attain only our *present* level of morality they will
<br>
abstain from reenactments of Gettysburg, World War II, or even
<br>
a day in the life of some poor soul in the U.S. who is suffering
<br>
from depression.
<br>
<p>It seems both pointless and immoral to run simulations that
<br>
are in any sense correct emulations of our present world.
<br>
<p>Therefore, granting that the simulations do occur in great
<br>
numbers, as you, X9987ghy7Q say, then it is most likely the
<br>
case that no real suffering is happening, and we only have
<br>
the *memories* of having suffered.  And those whose entire
<br>
lives are never ending bouts of schizophrenia and misery
<br>
aren't being emulated at all, but are only being portrayed.
<br>
<p>So the whole ensemble of simulations dribbles off into 
<br>
imponderable semi-simulations of unknown characteristics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As computer power increases over time so too must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the frequency and capability of those simulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given a simple statistical evaluation of the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is nearly inescapable that we must in fact be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resident in such a simulation (even if it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detectable as such to us). In fact these simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures must so substantially outweigh any &quot;real&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures that most often any thinking and intro-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spective being is most likely in such a simulation.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Such a simulation would explain many aspects of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions discussed on this list. Why are there no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visiting aliens? 
</em><br>
<p>Hell why not indeed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; why they're not present in our simulation....etc etc etc
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that you adduce further evidence that
<br>
&quot;this&quot; is not a simulation at all or is a simulation
<br>
that does not include life elsewhere within a sphere
<br>
of a billion light years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real question becomes then if one is resident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a simulation how to &quot;discover&quot; this fact?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How to communicate with the &quot;runner&quot; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation... and what benefit may be derived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from doing so? (It may in fact be futile and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best ignored. Shall we then behave and believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are in fact real?)
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely yes, we ought to suppose at all times
<br>
that our pointer &quot;this&quot; is pointing to the real
<br>
instances.  There is utterly no payoff to focus
<br>
on the instances of the pointer &quot;*this&quot; that 
<br>
refer to the interior of simulations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Ultimately this may be a futile question with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no answer but it may in fact be the only question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth answering.
</em><br>
<p>I very much doubt it, X9, (may I call you &quot;X9&quot; for
<br>
short?  :-)     A better question might be, shall
<br>
we run simulations when we have the ability, and
<br>
what shall we run?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Python had it wrong...the earth isn't a massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer designed to answer some obscure question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...the whole universe is...
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  Now that *could* be!  But it ought to be saved
<br>
for another thread, another time, and another email.
<br>
