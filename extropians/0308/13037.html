<p>
About a week ago, a contributor of long standing was suddenly
<br>
and summarily expelled from this list, an act that seemed to
<br>
me capricious and perhaps arbitrary, and for several days after
<br>
that, I didn't feel like posting anything.  During that time,
<br>
I thought that I was just annoyed, and that it would pass.
<br>
<p>But my feelings on the matter did not change in the days 
<br>
following, and I finally figured out why.  It was due to
<br>
the large number of posts I'd written and threads that I
<br>
had started in the past two years extolling to the skies
<br>
this list and the people who ran it; the theme of those
<br>
many, many posts was that through thick and thin, freedom
<br>
of speech had always won out in the end on the Extropians
<br>
forum.
<br>
<p>I now feel like a fool.
<br>
<p>However, I could live with that---after all, one does many
<br>
foolish things in life and one gets over it after a while.
<br>
But there is something far worse than looking or being
<br>
foolish.
<br>
<p>I will not be a hypocrite.
<br>
<p>My only choices are to either leave this list, or begin a
<br>
series of posts taking back all my fine words, renouncing
<br>
my praise, and admitting that my perceptions had been wrong,
<br>
or else pleading that actions like this never recur, or, etc.
<br>
etc.---moves sure to foment controversy and ugly discord (and
<br>
which would probably result in my own expulsion anyway).
<br>
<p>Any lessons learned?  So far, only one: be temperate in your
<br>
praise of others, else you will come to feel responsible for
<br>
their actions.  I hadn't known that.
<br>
<p>So anyway, in a single sentence there is no way for me to
<br>
communicate the appreciation I have of what I have learned
<br>
here, the information I've gleaned, the friendships I've
<br>
made, the laughs I've had, or the stimulating, productive,
<br>
and entertaining discourse I've been privileged to be a part
<br>
of.  It's been fun.  Good-bye, and good luck to everyone.
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin
