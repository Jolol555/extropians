Wonder how much of this reduction in the crime rate is attributable to the 
<br>
large increase in legal private gun ownership in the U.S., particularly 
<br>
legally carried guns.

<p>Report: Crime rate lowest since 1973
<br>
Sunday, August 24, 2003 Posted: 11:53 AM EDT (1553 GMT)
<br>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Violent and property crimes dipped in 2002 to their 
<br>
lowest levels since records started being compiled 30 years ago, and have 
<br>
dropped more than 50 percent in the last decade, the Justice Department 
<br>
reported Sunday.
<br>
The annual survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics identified about 23 
<br>
million crime victims last year, down slightly from the year before and far 
<br>
below the 44 million recorded when studies began in 1973.
<br>
The rate of violent crimes -- rapes, robberies and assaults -- was about 23 
<br>
victims for every 1,000 U.S. residents 12 or older last year. That compares 
<br>
with 25 victims per 1,000 in 2001 and 50 in 1993.
<br>
For property crimes such as burglary and car theft, the rate was 159 crimes 
<br>
per 1,000 last year, down from 167 the previous year and 319 in 1993.
<br>
The study examined property and violent crimes except murder, which is 
<br>
measured separately by the FBI. Preliminary FBI statistics for 2002 
<br>
released in June -- based on reports from police across the country -- 
<br>
reported a 0.8 percentage point rise in the murder rate compared with 2001.
<br>
The Justice Department survey, however, found continuing decreases in every 
<br>
major property and violent crime, crossing all household income, racial and 
<br>
ethnic lines. Crime is down in cities, suburbs and rural areas.
<br>
Attorney General John Ashcroft credited citizens for being more willing to 
<br>
report crimes and said the numbers are a tribute to the work of police, 
<br>
prosecutors and judges across the country.
<br>
&quot;But lower crime rates must not lead to complacency,&quot; Ashcroft said. &quot;We 
<br>
must continue our vigilance and renew our firm commitment to protect all 
<br>
Americans, bringing swift and certain justice to all those who would 
<br>
inflict pain and harm.&quot;
<br>
Experts say a number of factors have driven the crime rate down, including 
<br>
a more mature, less violent illegal drug trade, a drop in gang membership 
<br>
and even improved home locks and alarms that deter would-be burglars.
<br>
Even so, the continuing drop in crime surprises some.
<br>
&quot;Everyone thought the numbers would bottom out and then go back up, but it 
<br>
hasn't happened,&quot; said James Lynch, law professor at the American 
<br>
University Center for Justice, Law and Society.
<br>
Some criminologists think tougher prison sentences and more prisons are key 
<br>
factors, because they take more criminals off the streets longer. The 
<br>
Justice Department reported last week that at the end of 2001, more than 
<br>
5.6 million adults -- one in every 37 U.S. adults -- were either in state 
<br>
or federal prison or had done prison time during their lives.
<br>
Others say that theory is refuted by the government's own data. The Justice 
<br>
Policy Institute, a research group that favors alternatives to prison, 
<br>
pointed out that regions with higher prison expansion rates, such as the 
<br>
South and West, experienced more murders in 2002.
<br>
&quot;We need to separate political rhetoric from sound crime and corrections 
<br>
policy,&quot; said Vincent Schiraldi, executive director of the institute.
<br>
The Justice Department figures on nonfatal crimes for 2002 are based on 
<br>
interviews of a nationally representative sample of 76,050 U.S. residents 
<br>
12 or above. The previously released FBI Uniform Crime Reports, which also 
<br>
showed an overall drop in crime in 2002, is based on crimes reported to 
<br>
state and local police nationwide.
<br>
Some highlights from the new Justice Department report:
<br>
-- From 2001 to 2002, the number of robberies fell by a remarkable 19 
<br>
percent, from 630,690 to 512,490, and is down 63 percent from 1993 to 2002.
<br>
-- Households with an annual income of $50,000 or more saw larger drops in 
<br>
property crimes than those with lower incomes from 1993 to 2002. Property 
<br>
crimes have dropped 52 percent over that span in rural and suburban areas 
<br>
and 48 percent in cities.
<br>
-- Households with annual incomes of $7,500 or less were far more likely to 
<br>
be involved in both violent and property crimes in 2002. For instance, 
<br>
there were about 52 burglaries per 1,000 households at that income level, 
<br>
compared with 32 per 1,000 for those earning between $7,500 and $14,999.
<br>
-- Men are more likely to be crime victims than women, blacks more likely 
<br>
than whites or Hispanics and people below age 24 more than those who are 
<br>
older.
<br>
-- Urban residents were victims of violent crime more often in 2002, at 33 
<br>
crimes for every 1,000 residents. That compares with 20 crimes per 1,000 
<br>
residents in the suburbs and 17 crimes per 1,000 people in rural areas.
<br>
-- Women and girls were most often victimized in 2002 by someone they knew, 
<br>
while men and boys had a greater chance of being victimized by a stranger. 
<br>
Of the female victims, 40 percent of offenders were described friends or 
<br>
acquaintances, 20 percent as intimate partners and seven percent as another 
<br>
relative.
