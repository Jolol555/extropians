You (and Other Riddles of Modern Life)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; August 3, 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  By STEPHEN J. DUBNER
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most brilliant young economist in America -- the one so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deemed, at least, by a jury of his elders -- brakes to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop at a traffic light on Chicago's south side. It is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sunny day in mid-June. He drives an aging green Chevy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cavalier with a dusty dashboard and a window that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite shut, producing a dull roar at highway speeds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the car is quiet for now, as are the noontime streets:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gas stations, boundless concrete, brick buildings with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plywood windows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An elderly homeless man approaches. It says he is homeless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right on his sign, which also asks for money. He wears a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torn jacket, too heavy for the warm day, and a grimy red
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baseball cap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The economist doesn't lock his doors or inch the car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward. Nor does he go scrounging for spare change. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just watches, as if through one-way glass. After a while,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the homeless man moves along.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''He had nice headphones,'' says the economist, still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watching in the rearview mirror. ''Well, nicer than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones I have. Otherwise, it doesn't look like he has many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assets.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steven Levitt tends to see things differently than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average person. Differently, too, than the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economist. This is either a wonderful trait or a troubling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one, depending on how you feel about economists. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average economist is known to wax oracularly about any and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all monetary issues. But if you were to ask Levitt his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion of some standard economic matter, he would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swipe the hair from his eyes and plead ignorance. ''I gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up a long time ago pretending that I knew stuff I didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know,'' he says. ''I mean, I just -- I just don't know very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much about the field of economics. I'm not good at math, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know a lot of econometrics, and I also don't know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do theory. If you ask me about whether the stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market's going to go up or down, if you ask me whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy's going to grow or shrink, if you ask me whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deflation's good or bad, if you ask me about taxes -- I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean, it would be total fakery if I said I knew anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about any of those things.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Levitt's view, economics is a science with excellent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools for gaining answers but a serious shortage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting questions. His particular gift is the ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ask such questions. For instance: If drug dealers make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much money, why do they still live with their mothers?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really caused crime rates to plunge during the past decade?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do real-estate agents have their clients' best interests at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart? Why do black parents give their children names that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may hurt their career prospects? Do schoolteachers cheat to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meet high-stakes testing standards? Is sumo wrestling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrupt?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And how does a homeless man afford $50 headphones?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people -- including a fair number of his peers -- might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize Levitt's work as economics at all. But he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely distilled the so-called dismal science down to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most primal aim: explaining how people get what they want,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or need. Unlike most academics, he is unafraid of using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal observations and curiosities (though he does fear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculus). He is an intuitionist. He sifts through a pile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of data to find a story that no one else had found. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devises a way to measure an effect that veteran economists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had declared unmeasurable. His abiding interests -- though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says he has never trafficked in them himself -- are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheating, corruption and crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His interest in the homeless man's headphones, meanwhile,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't last long. ''Maybe,'' he said later, ''it was just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testimony to the fact I'm too disorganized to buy a set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; headphones that I myself covet.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt is the first to say that some of his topics border
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the trivial. But he has proved to be such an ingenious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researcher and clear-eyed thinker that instead of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consigned to the fringe of his field, the opposite has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened: he has shown other economists just how well their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools can make sense of the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''Levitt is considered a demigod, one of the most creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in economics and maybe in all social science,'' says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colin Camerer, an economist at the California Institute of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology. ''He represents something that everyone thinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will be when they go to grad school in econ, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually they have the creative spark bored out of them by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endless math -- namely, a kind of intellectual detective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to figure stuff out.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt is a populist in a field that is undergoing a bout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of popularization. Undergraduates are swarming the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics departments of elite universities. Economics is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen as the ideal blend of intellectual prestige (it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offer a Nobel, after all) and practical training for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-flying finance career (unless, like Levitt, you choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to stay in academia). At the same time, economics is ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more visible in the real world, thanks to the continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fetishization of the stock market and the continuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixation with Alan Greenspan.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The greatest change, however, is within the scholarly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ranks. Microeconomists are gaining on the macro crowd,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empiricists gaining on the theorists. Behavioral economists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have called into doubt the very notion of ''homo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economicus,'' the supposedly rational decision-maker in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each of us. Young economists of every stripe are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclined to work on real-world subjects and dip into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bordering disciplines -- psychology, criminology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociology, even neurology -- with the intent of rescuing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their science from its slavish dependence upon mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt fits everywhere and nowhere. He is a noetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; butterfly that no one has pinned down -- he was once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered a job on the Clinton economic team, and the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign approached him about being a crime adviser -- but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is widely appreciated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''Steve isn't really a behavioral economist, but they'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy to have him,'' says Austan Goolsbee, who teaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Business. ''He's not really an old price-theory guy, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these Chicago guys are happy to claim him. He's not really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Cambridge guy'' -- although Levitt went to Harvard and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then M.I.T. -- ''but they'd love him to come back.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has critics, to be sure. Daniel Hamermesh, a prominent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor economist at the University of Texas, has taught
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt's paper ''The Impact of Legalized Abortion on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Crime'' to his undergraduates. ''I've gone over this paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in draft, in its printed version, at great length, and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the life of me I can't see anything wrong with it,''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hamermesh says. ''On the other hand, I don't believe a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it. And his stuff on sumo wrestlers -- well, this is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly fundamental, unless you're Japanese and weigh 500
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pounds.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But at 36, Levitt is a full professor in the University of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chicago's economics department, the most legendary program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the country. (He received tenure after only two years.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is an editor of The Journal of Political Economy, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading journal in the field. And the American Economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Association recently awarded him its John Bates Clark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medal, given biennially to the country's best economist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under 40.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is a prolific and diverse writer. But his paper linking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rise in abortion to a drop in crime has made more noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the rest combined. Levitt and his co-author, John
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Donohue of Stanford Law School, argued that as much as 50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percent of the huge drop in crime since the early 1990's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be traced to Roe v. Wade. Their thinking goes like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this: the women most likely to seek an abortion -- poor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single, black or teenage mothers -- were the very women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose children, if born, have been shown most likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become criminals. But since those children weren't born,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime began to decrease during the years they would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entered their criminal prime. In conversation, Levitt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduces the theory to a tidy syllogism: ''Unwantedness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads to high crime; abortion leads to less unwantedness;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortion leads to less crime.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt had already published widely about crime and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; punishment. One paper he wrote as a graduate student is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still regularly cited. His question was disarmingly simple:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do more police translate into less crime? The answer would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem obvious -- yes -- but had never been proved: since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of police officers tends to rise along with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of crimes, the effectiveness of the police was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricky to measure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt needed a mechanism that would unlink the crime rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from police hiring. He found it within politics. He noticed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that mayors and governors running for re-election often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hire more police officers. By measuring those police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases against crime rates, he was able to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that additional officers do indeed bring down violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That paper was later disputed -- another graduate student
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found a serious mathematical mistake in it -- but Levitt's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ingenuity was obvious. He began to be acknowledged as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; master of the simple, clever solution. He was the guy who,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the slapstick scene, sees all the engineers futzing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a broken machine -- and then realizes that no one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought to plug it in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arguing that the police help deter crime didn't make Levitt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any enemies. Arguing that abortion deterred crime was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the abortion paper, published in 2001, he and Donohue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warned that their findings should not be seen ''as either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an endorsement of abortion or a call for intervention by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the state in the fertility decisions of women.'' They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested that crime might just as easily be curbed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''providing better environments for those children at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest risk for future crime.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, the very topic managed to offend nearly everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conservatives were enraged that abortion could be construed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a crime-fighting tool. Liberals were aghast that poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and black women were singled out. Economists grumbled that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt's methodology was not sound. A syllogism, after all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be a magic trick: All cats die; Socrates died;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore Socrates was a cat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''I think he's enormously clever in so many areas, focusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much on the issue of reverse causality,'' says Ted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joyce, an economist at Baruch College who has written a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical response to the abortion paper. ''But in this case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think he ignored it, or didn't tend to it well enough.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the news media gorged on the abortion-crime story,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt came under direct assault. He was called an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologue (by conservatives and liberals alike), a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eugenicist, a racist and downright evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In reality, he seems to be very much none of those. He has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little taste for politics and less for moralizing. He is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genial, low-key and unflappable, confident but not cocky.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is a respected teacher and colleague; he is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sought-after collaborator who, because of the breadth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his curiosities, often works with scholars outside his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field -- another rarity for an economist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''I hesitate to use these words, but Steve is a con man, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best sense,'' says Sudhir Venkatesh, a sociologist at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Columbia University. ''He's the Shakespearean jester. He'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make you believe his ideas were yours.'' Venkatesh was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt's co-author on ''An Economic Analysis of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drug-Selling Gang's Finances,'' which found that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average street dealer lives with his mother because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take-home pay is, frankly, terrible. The paper analyzed one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crack gang's financial activities as if it were any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation. (It was Venkatesh who procured the data, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a former gang member.) Such a thing had never been tried.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''This lack of focus,'' Levitt deadpanned in one version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the paper, ''is perhaps partly attributable to the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that few economists have been involved in the study of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gangs.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt speaks with a boyish lisp. His appearance is High
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nerd: a plaid button-down shirt, nondescript khakis and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; braided belt, sensible shoes. His pocket calendar is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branded with the National Bureau of Economic Research logo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''I wish he would get more than three haircuts a year,''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his wife, Jeannette, says, ''and that he wasn't still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wearing the same glasses he got 15 years ago, which weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even in fashion then.'' He was a good golfer in high school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but has so physically atrophied that he calls himself ''the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weakest human being alive'' and asks Jeannette to open jars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around the house.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is nothing in his appearance or manner, in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, that suggests a flamethrower. He will tell you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all he does is sit at his desk, day and night, wrestling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with some strange mountain of data. He will tell you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he would do it free (his salary is reportedly more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $200,000), and you tend to believe him. He may be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accidental provocateur, but he is a provocateur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonetheless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He takes particular delight in catching wrongdoers. In one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper, he devised a set of algorithms that could identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teachers in the Chicago public-school system who were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheating. ''Cheating classrooms will systematically differ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from other classrooms along a number of dimensions,'' he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his co-author, Brian Jacob of the Kennedy School of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Government, wrote in ''Catching Cheating Teachers.'' ''For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, students in cheating classrooms are likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience unusually large test-score gains in the year of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cheating, followed by unusually small gains or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declines in the following year when the boost attributable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cheating disappears.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt used test-score data from the Chicago schools that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had long been available to other researchers. There were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of ways, he realized, that a teacher could cheat. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she were particularly brazen (and stupid), she might give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; students the correct answers. Or, after the test, she might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually erase students' wrong answers and fill in correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones. A sophisticated cheater would be careful to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conspicuous blocks of identical answers. But Levitt was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sophisticated. ''The first step in analyzing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspicious strings is to estimate the probability each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child would give a particular answer on each question,'' he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrote. ''This estimation is done using a multinomial logit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework with past test scores, demographics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socioeconomic characteristics as explanatory variables.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So by measuring any number of factors -- the difficulty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a particular question, the frequency with which students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got hard questions right and easy ones wrong, the degree to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which certain answers were highly correlated in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classroom -- Levitt identified which teachers he thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were cheating. (Perhaps just as valuable, he was also able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to identify the good teachers.) The Chicago school system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than disputing Levitt's findings, invited him into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the schools for retesting. As a result, the cheaters were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there is his coming ''Understanding Why Crime Fell in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 1990's: Four Factors That Explain the Decline and Seven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That Do Not.'' The entire drop in crime, Levitt says, was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to more police officers, more prisoners, the waning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crack epidemic and Roe v. Wade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One factor that probably didn't make a difference, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argues, was the innovative policing strategy trumpeted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New York by Rudolph Giuliani and William Bratton.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''I think,'' Levitt says, ''I'm pretty much alone in saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He comes from a Minneapolis family of high, if unusual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievers. His father, a medical researcher, is considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a leading authority on intestinal gas. (He bills himself as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''The Man Who Gave Status to Flatus and Class to Gas.'')
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of Levitt's great uncles, Robert May, wrote ''Rudolph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' -- the book, that is; another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great uncle, Johnny Marks, later wrote the song.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At Harvard, Levitt wrote his senior thesis on thoroughbred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breeding and graduated summa cum laude. (He is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obsessed with horse racing. He says he believes it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrupt and has designed a betting system -- the details of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which he will not share -- to take advantage of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corruption.) He worked for two years as a management
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consultant before enrolling at M.I.T. for a doctorate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics. The M.I.T. program was famous for its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical intensity. Levitt had taken exactly one math
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course as an undergraduate and had forgotten even that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During his first graduate class, he asked the student next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to him about a formula on the board: Is there any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between the derivative sign that's straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up-and-down and the curly one? ''You are in so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble,'' he was told.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''People wrote him off,'' recalls Austan Goolsbee, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chicago economist who was then a classmate. ''They'd say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'That guy has no future.'''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt set his own course. Other grad students stayed up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all night working on problem sets, trying to make good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grades. He stayed up researching and writing. ''My view was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the way you succeed in this profession is you write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great papers,'' he says. ''So I just started.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes he would begin with a question. Sometimes it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a set of data that caught his eye. He spent one entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summer typing into his computer the results of years' worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Congressional elections. (Today, with so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information so easily available on the Internet, Levitt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complains that he can't get his students to input data at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.) All he had was a vague curiosity about why incumbents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were so often re-elected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then he happened upon a political-science book whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authors claimed that money wins elections, period. ''They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were trying to explain election outcomes as a function of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign expenditures,'' he recalls, ''completely ignoring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that contributors will only give money to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challengers when they have a realistic chance of winning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and incumbents only spend a lot when they have a chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losing. They convinced themselves this was the causal story
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though it's so obvious in retrospect that it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spurious effect.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obvious, at least, to Levitt. Within five minutes, he had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision of the paper he would write. ''It came to me,'' he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says, ''in full bloom.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem was that his data couldn't tell him who was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good candidate and who wasn't. It was therefore impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tease out the effect of the money. As with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police/crime rate puzzle, he had to trick the data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because he himself had typed in the data, he had noticed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something: often, the same two candidates faced each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple times. By analyzing the data from only those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elections, Levitt was able to find a true result. His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion: campaign money has about one-tenth the impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as was commonly accepted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An unknown graduate student, he sent his paper to The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Journal of Political Economy -- one professor told him he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was crazy for even trying -- where it was published. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completed his Ph.D. in three years, but because of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priorities, he says, he was ''invisible'' to the faculty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''a real zero.'' Then he stumbled upon what he now calls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the turning point in his career.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He had an interview for the Society of Fellows, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; venerable intellectual Harvard clubhouse that pays young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scholars to do their own work, for three years, with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commitments. Levitt felt he didn't stand a chance. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starters, he didn't consider himself an intellectual. He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be interviewed over dinner by the senior fellows, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection of world-renowned philosophers, scientists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historians. He worried he wouldn't have enough conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for even the first course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, he was on fire. Whatever subject came up -- the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, ants, philosophy -- he just happened to remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something pithy he'd read. His wit crackled as it had never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crackled before. When he told them about the two summers he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent betting the horses back in Minnesota, they ate it up!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally -- disquietingly -- one of them said: ''I'm having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hard time seeing the unifying theme of your work. Could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you explain it?''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt was stymied. He had no idea what his unifying theme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was, or if he even had one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amartya Sen, the future Nobel-winning economist, jumped in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and neatly summarized what he saw as Levitt's theme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, Levitt said eagerly, that's my theme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then offered another theme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're right, Levitt said, that's my theme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went, like dogs tugging at a bone, until the philosopher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert Nozick interrupted. If Levitt could have been said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have an intellectual hero, it would be Nozick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''How old are you, Steve?'' he asked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''Twenty-six.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nozick turned to the other fellows: ''He's 26 years old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why does he need to have a unifying theme? Maybe he's going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be one of those people who's so talented he doesn't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one. He'll take a question and he'll just answer it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it'll be fine.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The University of Chicago's economics department had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; famous unifying theme -- the Gospel of Free Markets, with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative twist -- and would therefore not have seemed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most likely fit for Levitt. As he sees it, Chicago is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about theory, deep thinking and big ideas, while he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about empiricism, clever thinking and ''cute but ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insubstantial ideas.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Chicago also had Gary Becker. To Levitt, Becker is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most influential economist of the past 50 years. Long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before it was fashionable, Becker brought microeconomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory to offbeat topics, the family and crime in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular. For years, Becker was demonized -- a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrase like ''the price of children'' would set off untold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alarms. ''I took a lot of heat over my career from people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who thought my work was silly or irrelevant or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economics,'' Becker says. But Chicago supported him; he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persevered, winning the Nobel Prize in 1992; and he became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steven Levitt's role model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Becker told Levitt that Chicago would be a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment for him. ''Not everybody agrees with all your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results,'' he said, ''but we agree what you're doing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very interesting work, and we'll support you in that.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt soon found that the support at Chicago went beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scholarly. The year after he was hired, his wife gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birth to their first child, Andrew. One day, just after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Andrew turned a year old, he came down with a slight fever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The doctor diagnosed an ear infection. When he started
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vomiting the next morning, his parents took him to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hospital. A few days later he was dead of pneumococcal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meningitis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amid the shock and grief, Levitt had an undergraduate class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that needed teaching. It was Gary Becker -- a Nobel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laureate nearing his 70th birthday -- who sat in for him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another colleague, D. Gale Johnson, sent a condolence card
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Levitt still quotes from memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt and Johnson, an agricultural economist in his 80's,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; began speaking regularly. Levitt learned that Johnson's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; daughter was one of the first Americans to adopt a daughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from China. Soon the Levitts adopted a daughter of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own, whom they named Amanda. In addition to Amanda, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have since had a daughter, now almost 3, and a son. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Andrew's death has played on, in various ways. They have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become close friends with the family of the little girl to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whom they donated Andrew's liver. (They also donated his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart, but that baby died.) And not surprisingly for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scholar who pursues real-life subjects, the death also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informed Levitt's work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He and Jeannette joined a support group for grieving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parents. Levitt was struck by how many children had drowned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in swimming pools. They were the kinds of deaths that don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the newspaper -- unlike, for instance, a child who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dies while playing with a gun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Levitt was curious and went looking for numbers that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell the story. He wrote up the results as an op-ed article
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for The Chicago Sun-Times. It featured the sort of plangent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterintuition for which he has become famous: ''If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own a gun and have a swimming pool in the yard, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swimming pool is almost 100 times more likely to kill a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child than the gun is.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trying to get his mind off death, Levitt took up a hobby:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rehabbing and selling old houses in Oak Park, where he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives. This experience has led to yet another paper, about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the real-estate market. It is his most Chicago-style paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet, a romp in price theory, a sign that the university's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence on him is perhaps as strong as his influence on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. But Levitt being Levitt, it also deals with corruption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While negotiating to buy old houses, he found that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seller's agent often encouraged him, albeit cagily, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underbid. This seemed odd: didn't the agent represent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seller's best interest? Then he thought more about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent's role. Like many other ''experts'' (auto mechanics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and stockbrokers come to mind), a real-estate agent is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought to know his field far better than a lay person. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homeowner is encouraged to trust the agent's information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if the agent brings in a low offer and says it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just be the best the homeowner can expect, the homeowner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tends to believe him. But the key, Levitt determined, lay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the fact that agents ''receive only a small share of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incremental profit when a house sells for a higher value.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like a stockbroker churning commissions or a bookie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grabbing his vig, an agent was simply looking to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal, any deal. So he would push homeowners to sell too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast and too cheap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now if Levitt could only measure this effect. Once again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he found a clever mechanism. Using data from more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50,000 home sales in Cook County, Ill., he compared the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figures for homes owned by real-estate agents with those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for homes for which they acted only as agents. The agents'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homes stayed on the market about 10 days longer and sold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for 2 percent more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Late on a summer afternoon, Levitt is in his office, deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside one of the university's Gothic behemoths. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ceiling is stained, the plaster around the window
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crumbling. He is just back from sabbatical at Stanford, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his desk is a holy mess: stacks of books and journals, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; green sippy cup and a little orange squeeze hippo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is his afternoon to meet with students. Levitt drinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Mountain Dew and talks softly. Some students come for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research assignments, some for advice. One has just written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her undergraduate thesis: ''The Labor Market Consequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Graduating College in a Bad Economy.'' For a thesis, Levitt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tells her, it's very good. But now she wants to have it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; published.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''You write like a college student, and that's a problem,''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he says. ''The thing is, you're telling a story. There's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreshadowing going on, all those tricks. You want the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reader going down a particular path so when they get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results, they understand them and believe them. But you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also want to be honest about your weaknesses. People are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much less harsh on weaknesses that are clear than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaknesses that are hidden -- as they should be.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be honest about your weaknesses. Has there ever been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prize-winning scholar as honest about his weaknesses as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steven Levitt? He doesn't understand economics, he claims,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or math. He's a little thinker in a world of big thinkers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He can't even open a jar of spaghetti sauce at home, poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friends say that Levitt's self-deprecation is as calculated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it is genuine. Within academia, economists take pride in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being the most cutthroat of a cutthroat breed. Anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writes papers on ''Weakest Link'' (contestants discriminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against Latino and elderly peers, Levitt concluded, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blacks or women) and sumo (to best manage their tournament
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rankings, wrestlers often conspire to throw matches) had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better not also be arrogant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or maybe it is not self-deprecation at all. Maybe it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-flagellation. Maybe what Steven Levitt really wants is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to graduate from his ''silly'' and ''trivial'' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ''shallow'' topics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He thinks he's onto something with a new paper about black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; names. He wanted to know if someone with a distinctly black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name suffers an economic penalty. His answer -- contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other recent research -- is no. But now he has a bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question: Is black culture a cause of racial inequality or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is it a consequence? For an economist, even for Levitt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is new turf -- ''quantifying culture,'' he calls it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a task, he finds it thorny, messy, perhaps impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and deeply tantalizing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Driving home to Oak Park that evening, his Cavalier glumly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrumming along the Eisenhower Expressway, he dutifully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addresses his future. Leaving academia for a hedge fund or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a government job does not interest him (though he might, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the side, start a company to catch cheating teachers). He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is said to be at the top of every economics department's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poaching list. But the tree he and Jeannette planted when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Andrew died is getting too big to move. You get the feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he may stay at Chicago awhile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are important problems, he says, that he feels ready
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to address.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For instance? ''Tax evasion. Money-laundering. I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put together a set of tools that lets us catch terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, that's the goal. I don't necessarily know yet how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd go about it. But given the right data, I have little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt that I could figure out the answer.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might seem absurd for an economist to dream of catching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists. Just as it must have seemed absurd if you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Chicago schoolteacher, called into an office and told
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, ahem, the algorithms designed by that skinny man with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thick glasses had determined that you are a cheater. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you are being fired. Steven Levitt may not fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in himself, but he does believe in this: teachers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and criminals and real-estate agents may lie, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians, and even C.I.A. analysts. But numbers don't.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Stephen J. Dubner is the author, most recently, of
