<p>You're right about the way things are right now,
<br>
including current prices.  If oil, gas, and coal were
<br>
not so cheap relative to renewable sources, then
<br>
renewable sources would be far more popular.
<br>
<p>There are two obvious ways to address this: raise the
<br>
price of fossil fuels, or lower the price of
<br>
renewables.  Raising the price has its merits, and a
<br>
mass consumption of the cheap supply (thus naturally
<br>
raising prices) is already underway, but this results
<br>
in release of large volumes of environmentally less
<br>
than beneficial gases.  Plus, the rate does not seem
<br>
able to keep up with advancing technology, and
<br>
attempts to deliberately drastically increase the
<br>
consumption rate without getting useful work out of
<br>
the fuel, such as conducted a bit over a decade ago in
<br>
Kuwait, are extremely unpopular (for good reason).
<br>
<p>Which leaves us with options for making renewables
<br>
much cheaper much faster.  The price of renewables is
<br>
falling relative to non-renewables, but if one were
<br>
inclined to devote one's working efforts towards this,
<br>
the solar panel manufacturing and installing business
<br>
is not the bleakest industry in the world right now,
<br>
especially after the northeastern US's recent
<br>
blackout.  More competition means cheaper prices
<br>
faster.  There are other ways, of course, including
<br>
such small efforts as merely purchasing solar power
<br>
oneself.  (Half of my roof has solar panels, which -
<br>
with a few other measures that were going to happen
<br>
regardless - cut my house's power bill from $400/month
<br>
to about $4/month.  I'd have to check the numbers, but
<br>
it is possible the system may have paid for itself
<br>
already; we had it installed a few months after
<br>
California's blackouts.)
