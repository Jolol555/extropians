</em><br>
<p>Exactly. The problem is to keep a balance between worrying about 
<br>
possibilities and waiting too complacently. If we show that we care about 
<br>
the risks and want to minimize them, many people react favorably - but too 
<br>
much disaster scenarios may make people fearful. Showing that many worries 
<br>
are groundless is important to help research develop, but we should not be 
<br>
polyannas assuming everything automatically turns out the best. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The precautionary principle in its active form suggests that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should actively find ways of protecting ourselves from the risks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a bad AI even if it is an unknown factor; friendliness theory
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shouldn't distract us from actually getting a better knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The precautionary principle is one of the worst notions I have ever 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually, in its simple and correct form it is just common sense. What you
<br>
react to is how it is *usually* used - &quot;don't do anything until you have
<br>
proven it safe!&quot; which is actually a misinterpretation of it (just look at
<br>
how it is stated in the Rio Protocol, as an example). The corrupted
<br>
version is unfortunately the one that is used most widely by conservatives
<br>
of all colors. The active form I mentioned (absence of scientic proof of a
<br>
danger is no reason not to proactively minimize dangers) can of course be
<br>
used to stifle development too, but judiciously used it makes a lot of
<br>
sense when venturing into the unknown.
