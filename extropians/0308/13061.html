<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure I understand the relevance of the voting discussion. I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting that we vote people off the list, I'm suggesting that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might change their behavior in response to the signals they get about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of their posts. Think of it as somewhat like a market. We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producers of messages and we want as many people to &quot;buy&quot; our messages as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. If I send out messages that have a high perceived noise to
</em><br>
signal
<br>
<em>&gt; ratio many people will put me in their killfile, so I will have fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;buyers&quot;. I agree about the perennial dangers of centralized authority,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; while what I am suggesting is not immune from distortion, I also think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangers of corruption are fairly minimal. The public display of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfiles might look like a table with everyone's name on this list (there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is what about a 1000 people on this list?) on the X and Y axis. I could
</em><br>
look
<br>
<em>&gt; up your name and see if I am in your killfile and you can look up my name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see if I am in your killfile. One conjecture then is that if people
</em><br>
can
<br>
<em>&gt; signal their dislike of someone's posts by using the killfile this may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce the acrimonious exchanges that sometimes go on. If we are having
</em><br>
such
<br>
<em>&gt; an exchange I might put you in my killfile and you might retaliate by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting me in your killfile--and so would end the exchange. Next to each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's name would be the number of people that have entered him or her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into their killfiles. The conjecture is that people might change their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior so as not to be entered into too many killfiles. Take an extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example. Suppose an individual posts tons of Nazi propaganda to the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every day. I conjecture that almost all will enter this person into their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfiles, hence the Nazi's voice will go unheard. This Nazi cannot
</em><br>
complain
<br>
<em>&gt; about a centralized authority squashing her voice since the killfiles are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set by individuals. As I said, the right to free speech does not entail an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obligation on others to listen. The reason this system would be relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impervious to corruption is that each person's killfile would be
</em><br>
displayed.
<br>
<em>&gt; If there was an attempt to discredit someone by artificially raising their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfile quotient this could be easily detected because each killfile is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assignable to a specific individual. If the list managers tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificially raise your killfile quotient they would have to assign it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some individuals, say one of them is me. When I look and see that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences have been tampered with I will scream bloody blue murder on
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; off the list.
</em><br>
<p>In your message you use the word killfile fifteen times.
<br>
<p>Maybe it has to to with a language barrier, but when I read the word
<br>
killfile 15 times in a 35 line message I get the impression there is a war
<br>
going on in the heads of the posters. All this scoring and voting,
<br>
collecting
<br>
points, making impressions, being competitive, getting adapted to the rat
<br>
race of a mental market place.. Scoring, statistics  . . . well I simply
<br>
don`t like it. The use of this very word &quot;killfile&quot; suggests a hostile
<br>
atmosphere, at least a competitive one with this
<br>
noise-to-signal-ratio-correctness, always this obsession to be efficient.
<br>
<p>I never implemented a killfile in my whole Internet career. I want to *know*
<br>
what my opponents think. That's why I read their messages with a special
<br>
care and interest. Sometimes I learn from them more than from persons I
<br>
always agree with.
