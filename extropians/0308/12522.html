<p>
Mr. Orlowski,
<br>
I must seriously object to the many bigoted and offensive things you
<br>
wrote in your piece on Robin Hanson and the transhumanist movement.
<br>
Just where do you get off writing hate speech which would get you
<br>
prosecuted if you were talking this way about blacks, hispanics, or
<br>
women? All that aside, I think you should be aware of the many
<br>
innacuracies in your article:
<br>
<p>Inaccuracy #1: Extropians are wealthy.
<br>
This is quite untrue. While some have made enough money from dot com
<br>
ventures to be financially secure, most have not. I myself am a former
<br>
tech writer working as a diesel mechanic. Many extropians are grad or
<br>
undergrad college students, quite poor or scraping by, and staying in
<br>
school because the job market stinks so badly.
<br>
<p>Inaccuracy #2: Robin Hanson is wealthy.
<br>
Robin, who I know personally, is hardly wealthy. He supports a wife and
<br>
two kids on the salary of an assistant professor. The only wealth he
<br>
has is the immense number of friends he has and admirers of his many
<br>
contributions to his field.
<br>
<p>Inaccuracy #3: Extropians are all white.
<br>
This is the worst sort of racist backhanded accusation. There are a
<br>
number of extropians who are black, hispanic, asian, native american,
<br>
among many other nationalities and ethnicities, as well as sexual
<br>
preferences and genders. And even if we were all straight white males,
<br>
does this automatically make us deserving of your hate? Are we all part
<br>
of the oppressor class simply because of our genes? I myself never
<br>
inherited anything, dropped out of college (twice now) due to finances,
<br>
and the highest leadership positions I've held were on the board of
<br>
directors of my local gun club and as an executive of a company I once
<br>
helped found.
<br>
<p>The fact is, as was plain in your article, was that you couldn't find
<br>
much that other people had to say that was bad about us or Robin, so
<br>
you had to make up a bunch of absolute garbage in your typically
<br>
cynical vulturous tabloid journalist way.
<br>
<p>As for the PAM, here is a rhetorical question for you to ponder: How
<br>
are individuals betting on the PAM futures market any less morbid than
<br>
you buying an insurance policy on your spouse's life???? That is, after
<br>
all, what you are doing when you buy insurance: you are betting that
<br>
something bad is going to happen, and you get paid off if you are
<br>
right.
<br>
<p>The PAM only serves as a means to bribe terrorists to become informers
<br>
on their comrades, thus useful in preventing the events they are meant
<br>
to predict. Note that an informer on PAM would get paid whether the
<br>
ATTEMPT succeeds or not. Arafat needent be assasinated, so long as an
<br>
attempt is made. 
<br>
<p>In this light, it actually seems that the PAM is actually LESS morbid
<br>
than you getting life insurance on your spouse. With your insurance,
<br>
your spouse HAS to die. With PAM, (s)he would only need to be in a
<br>
situation where she MIGHT have died.
<br>
<p>I think you owe an apology to Robin and extropians in general.
