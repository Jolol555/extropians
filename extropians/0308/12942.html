Maybe now we can more about AI, cryonics, crypto, networking, space travel,
<br>
and life extension. And less about gun control, patriotism, and emotional
<br>
attachment to one economic system versus another.
<br>
<p>Conformity? You damn well bet... localized, consensual, emergent
<br>
conformity. Also known as consensus. Also known as having a platform. Without
<br>
that, any forum or organization lacks meaning and focus. Luddites are not
<br>
welcome on this list, nor are Flat Earthers, nor are Scientologists. Maybe
<br>
left-wingers and right-wingers shouldn't be welcome either. After all, we
<br>
don't subscribe to NRA or GOP mailing lists and rant about nanouploads, do we?
<br>
<p>Maybe they should go off and found their own Extropian Gun-Nut or Extropian
<br>
Single-Payer Health Care or Extropian Europe Sux America Rulez lists... maybe
<br>
that will even memetically benefit Extropy overall by playing good cop/bad cop
<br>
with the public's perception of us (which one is the good one and which one is
<br>
the bad one depends of course on your frame of reference).
<br>
<p>But IMHO the list is better off without the constant Samantha/Mike
<br>
flamewars. Of course if Mikes absence doesn't solve the problem then by the
<br>
process of elimination we'll know where the problem lies.
<br>
<p>That being said, I actually agree with Mike on a lot of topics, particularly
<br>
free markets, gun rights, property rights, and individual responsibility. But
<br>
it's embarassing to have these views presented in a propagandistic,
<br>
confrontational, irrational manner. Decentralized systems work because they
<br>
work, not because they're the &quot;American Way&quot; nor because they have some sort
<br>
of privileged moral status. It's game theory and information theory, people,
<br>
not some kind of religion!
