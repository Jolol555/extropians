Isn't it odd that everyone loves to complain about the &quot;evil&quot; U.S, but when
<br>
something bad happens they always come to US for help?

<em>&gt; &gt; But what many of you americans seem to not understand is that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-americans most often *really* like USA despite it's many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faults. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that will not stop us from mentioning the faults.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do realize that, but what you who mention only faults don't realize is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you are indistinguishable from the chomskyite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything-the-US-has-done-is-absolutely-evil kind of person.  When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear nothing but criticisms, what evidence do we have to suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have anything to say other than criticisms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regardless, and just to clear this up, I think many of the complaints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waged against the US govt are valid.  I would most accurately be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered a minarchist libertarian, so I obviously oppose liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paternalism and socialism, and conservative lack of respect for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual freedoms.  Additionally, I oppose the war on drugs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incarceration perpetrators of victimless crimes.  The occurrence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence of these things really bothers me, but so do the atrocities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that occur in other countries, which are often far far worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as free countries go, I consider most of the post-industrialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; west close enough to not really be worth troubling myself over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences while other egregious differences are present in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrial and pre-industrial countries of the world.  If I could live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere I wanted, Id probably first pick Hong Kong (but would end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving soon as the Chinese took control again) second would be a close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runner up between the US and Australia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That being said, I too found Damiens posting a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;insensitive&quot; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; light of the recent developments on the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't find it 'insensitive' per se, just wanted to put perspective on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it relative to other world atrocities.  I found it very interesting that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the article was judging the incarceration rates of populations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  Interesting, I thought, I wonder how they got accurate data from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notoriously closed and oppressive societies?  If they were saying the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the highest incarceration rate in the world, surely they actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked at the rest of the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Upon further investigation, that was obviously not the case.  As noted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma, East Timor, North Korea etc. for a total of 17
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries had NO data present to compare.  Yet the CS Monitor did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find this noteworthy enough to even mention in their article.  It should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have read &quot;US has highest incarceration rate of the countries who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell us theirs, the notoriously worse countries incarceration rates are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknown&quot;
