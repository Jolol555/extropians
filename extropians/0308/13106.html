<p><p>USA is an interresting country. It is so full of contradictions. 
<br>
Contradictions make for good conflict and drama, and good discussion points.
<br>
<p>Many of us, even us europeans find that USA is in many respects close to 
<br>
an ideal free society. But that does not mean we agree in everything, or 
<br>
even understand the way you choose to do things. So often the 
<br>
contradictions stands out to us.
<br>
<p>But what many of you americans seem to not understand is that we 
<br>
non-americans most often *really* like USA despite it's many faults. But 
<br>
that will not stop us from mentioning the faults.
<br>
<p>Think of us as a normal dysfunctional family. Constantly nagging, but 
<br>
couldn't dream of living without each other ;-)
<br>
<p>That being said, I too found Damiens posting a bit &quot;insensitive&quot; in the 
<br>
light of the recent developments on the list.
