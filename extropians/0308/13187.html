<p>
First of all, I'm thrilled that you are on this list Dr. DeGray! The more
<br>
practicing researchers participate, the better.
<br>
<p>By productive detente I mean: we do science, they do science, and nobody calls
<br>
anybody else 'kooks', at least not in public. By moving *any* legitimate
<br>
scientific study forward, even people who disagree with my goals contribute
<br>
to them. Just some more directly than others. Active cooperation is best
<br>
of course, but I'll take passive cooperation over active opposition any
<br>
day. Heck, even in the field of aging I suspect most people view it as 'just
<br>
an interesting puzzle' and don't concern themselves with the implications.
<br>
<p>With regard to logic being on our side. I agree, but a PhD does not
<br>
automatically confer rationality in all facets of life. I've been trying all
<br>
my life to understand the knee-jerk &quot;hubris&quot; reaction people like us seem to
<br>
provoke, and still cannot understand it. It's almost as if the majority of the
<br>
world is somehow programmed to want to die. The only useful thing I've learned
<br>
from years of debates on this topic is to circumvent the issue by focusing
<br>
attention on more 'mundane' aspects of the research.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, there is one anti life-extension argument that I cannot accept,
<br>
yet also cannot fully refute: overpopulation. The basic rebuttals are...
<br>
<p>1. We need to get off the planet anyway. The problem with this rebuttal
<br>
is that it assumes the cost of launching payloads will go down far enough
<br>
and quickly enough to outpace the rate at which the population grows and
<br>
thereby allocates resources away from space colonization toward day-to-day
<br>
survival. This *may* happen, but we cannot assume that it *will*.
<br>
<p>2. Anti-aging treatments could be conditional on the patient opting for
<br>
permanent birth control. This would cause a massive cultural backlash in
<br>
most of the world. It also assumes one or a few discrete treatments that
<br>
could be controlled in such a manner by one or a few entities. It also
<br>
assumes that these entities would have the political will to impose such
<br>
conditions. Finally, there would be nothing preventing people from reproducing
<br>
first and then undergoing rejuvenating treatments, and their children doing
<br>
likewise, and so on... thus reducing the effectiveness of the permanent birth
<br>
control requirement.
<br>
<p>3. The earth's carrying capacity is unlimited. The problem with this rebuttal
<br>
is that it's untrue. Granted, the environmentalists may be exaggerating
<br>
the immediacy of the overpopulation threat because of their own political
<br>
agenda. However at some point, be it in the next 50 years or the next 500,
<br>
*something* is *going* to become a limiting factor-- be it habitable land,
<br>
fresh water, or utilizable energy. Life extension will result in this
<br>
bottleneck being approached faster.
<br>
<p>4. By keeping our geniuses alive longer, more concentrated expertise can be
<br>
brought to bear on all problems including overpopulation. Not impossible, but
<br>
highly speculative... we really have no way to even estimate the likelihood of
<br>
the overpopulation problem being solved in any given time frame.
<br>
<p><p>Again, I'm not presenting my own views here. I'm presenting opposing views I
<br>
cannot refute, and am seeking suggestions on.
<br>
<p><p>PS: I understand in general principle why the argument of death being &quot;good
<br>
for the next generation&quot; doesn't hold up-- group selection is a very weak
<br>
evolutionary force. Does anybody know of a rigorous, quantitative paper
<br>
explaining exactly what the limitations are on how much group selection could
<br>
have influenced evolution?
