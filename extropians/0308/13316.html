</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine. 
</em><br>
<p>In what terms?  Some of the fasters dragsters on the planet are all-electric.   
<br>
The limiting factors here are not in the fact that it is electric per se.    
<br>
In many measures of performance an electric is quite competitive.  And dig 
<br>
those maintenance cost differences!   100 years ago we did not have the 
<br>
knowledge to even produce dependable electricity or even have electricity in 
<br>
many parts of the country.   Battery technology is an important aspect of 
<br>
electrics.  Battery technology did not do much new until relatively recently.  
<br>
Light weight materials are also a plus.   It is hardly a worthwhile argument 
<br>
among extropians to put down something just because it hasn't already been 
<br>
done!  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Comming up wih &quot;decent
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction system..&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  I wish analogies would be banned.  An electric car is orders of 
<br>
magnitude simpler.    We are literally down to engineering problems and fine 
<br>
tuning and, of course, building the infrastructure for fast charging of 
<br>
electrics.   For personal transportation at least there is nothing I know of 
<br>
that makes an electric unviable. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Making an all-electric vehicle, and setting up fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-charing stations, is more difficult then it seems. I realize that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'anti-intuitive' that this should be so, but it is how the world is.
</em><br>
<p><p>In what way is it anywhere near as difficult as getting a working fusion 
<br>
reactor though?
