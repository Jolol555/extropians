<p><em>&gt; This is actually another way of exploring the FP. The enforcement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system has to be able to stop replicators before they get out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand, and we can start constraining them by theory and maybe even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start looking for them. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine &quot;antibodies&quot; spread evenly in the galaxy, detecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signature of a replicator seed. They immediately launch a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lightspeed attack on the seed; this will work only if...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between stars.  Hence we should expect antibodies with an average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance corresponding to the effective range of their weapon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than being relativistically limited - and this makes them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more likely to be detected.
</em><br>
<p>You have to like math a lot (and I do) and also have 
<br>
some other characteristic (which I do not) to appreciate
<br>
Anders' analysis involving ratios of volumes of spheres.
<br>
<p>But I greatly enjoy:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, it may even be reasonable for the galactic club
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make them relatively visible to interplanetary civilisations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since that way emerging civs might get the hint and abstain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from doing something stupid. 
</em><br>
<p>It would only be &quot;stupid&quot; in the sense of calling down
<br>
upon oneself severe punishment.  Cattle are so dumb that
<br>
they cannot read the signs &quot;please remain in the enclosure&quot;
<br>
and so barbed-wire needed to be invented.
<br>
<p>But for some reason that eludes me, we always assume that
<br>
the members of the galactic club are really mean and
<br>
ferocious (like in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;) and
<br>
have no compunctions at all about destroying the Earth
<br>
and it's six billion inhabitants.
<br>
<p>Animal rights activist would be rightly upset if no effort
<br>
whatsoever were made to keep squirrels or raccoons off one's
<br>
premises by fences or other expedients, and instead all 
<br>
animals wandering in to a certain area were just immediately
<br>
shot by radar-controlled automatic systems.
<br>
<p>So the big mystery to me is, why do we always assume the
<br>
aliens to be such mean dudes?
<br>
<p>YES!  For sure there would be WARNING SIGNS in huge capital
<br>
letters from the galactic club saying &quot;STAY HOME&quot;.  But all
<br>
we hear is total silence.
<br>
