<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Quite right.  Robert and many others have made it clear
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; travels, I have always thought that an integrated intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; probably can't be more than kilometers in size anyway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (depends on the kind of problems that it enjoys and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; gratification algorithms it executes).
</em><br>
<p>No!  It was *I* who wrote that, not Robbie.  Robbie
<br>
failed to give it any attribution at all.  Not been
<br>
reading my posts, eh, Robert?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is correct that it depends a *lot* on the definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;integrated&quot; and a lot on how much time you have to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about a problem.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's what I was getting at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If one has a long time to think about problems -- then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distributing parts of ones mind across as solar system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (say 10-50 AU) may not be a huge sacrifice while greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing one's safety.
</em><br>
<p>I do not see what safety has to do with it.
<br>
<p>Yes, suppose that one is interested in finding the next
<br>
Ramsey numbers (a nice math problem).  Then one has no
<br>
problem with off-loading a lot of the calculation to
<br>
Alpha Centauri, or participating in a galaxy-wide hunt
<br>
for the solutions.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The capacity of a 1 cm^3 nanocomputer is roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100,000 human minds in something like 1/1000 the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume (of a brain).  So I tend to use 10^6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase in intelligence as a conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and getting back to another issue, *this* is why we
<br>
would be so appealing for the beings of Tralfamdor to
<br>
colonize: we have plenty of unused cm^3s.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The communications bandwidth to a copy 25 AU away *will*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be low but it *will* be &quot;you&quot; (or a subcomponent of &quot;you&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so there will be a lot of shorthand notation.
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting that some remote copies you agree that
<br>
one should regard as self, while yesterday you seemed to
<br>
maintain that very remote Lee II's would be nothing but
<br>
threats eventually.  Have you changed your mind?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yep, you could propose such a computer.  But Robert will jump
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all over your butt for proposing &quot;magic physics&quot; on the ExI list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are a couple of people who have &quot;Get out of jail free&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cards to do this (Anders &amp; Robin come to mind since they know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot more physics than I do).  But anyone else gets jumped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on unless it is a serious &quot;what if&quot; kind of speculation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (The primary objection at least in my mind currently is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for QC to be useful you are going to have to propose a method
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for generating and maintaining kilo, mega, and giga amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of qubits.  If there isn't a concrete proposal for something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can actually build, then one gets a &quot;Go directly to jail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not pass Go and do not collect 200 dollars&quot; card.
</em><br>
<p>Who wrote that?  From the heading it appears to be Robert,
<br>
but then if so he is referring to himself in the third
<br>
person.  Did I miss a post somewhere?  Who else is quoted
<br>
above besides Robert, Robbie, and me (Lee Corbin)?
<br>
<p>Lee
