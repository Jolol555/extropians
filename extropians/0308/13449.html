I am sorry but as long as the discussion remains civil I thought it was 
<br>
perfectly fine to discuss political issues especially if they have some 
<br>
bearing on our abilities to accomplish our goals and retain our freedom to 
<br>
work toward those goals.  
<br>
<p>Are you now requesting that I don't reply to your question asking for details 
<br>
of where these laws are in fact dangerous to some of our fundamental civil 
<br>
liberties?    I am confused by your getting so riled up.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've given up on the idea of encouraging &quot;civil dialogue&quot; on contemporary

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply leave off from discussion of the hot-button political and
</em><br>
