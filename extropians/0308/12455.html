<p>
By the way, speaking of terrorism, let's all practice
<br>
what we will say the day that the first terrorist nuke
<br>
goes off in the U.S., probably in 2005:
<br>
<p>Hubert:   Man's inhumanity to man reaches unacceptable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heights---but the Americans did ask for it.
<br>
Damien:   This terrible tragedy compels everyone to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root for the Americans (today).
<br>
Mikey:    We should have enforced Patriot II, but now
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hopefully all the wheedling naysayers and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fainthearts will finally get a clue and we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can start taking *action*.
<br>
Samantha: Morals around the world are in an incredibly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sad state and we simply must do better to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raise everyone's understanding, consciousness,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compassion, and acceptance of each other.
<br>
Robert:   I calculate that with 4x10^4 ten-megaton weapons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2x10^9 people can be killed, and with a prob-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ability of .8, 7.2x10^13 present and future
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people's lives will be saved.
<br>
Lee:      I told you so.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That said, I agree that the actions of our domestic governments under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the banner of fighting terrorism pose more of a threat than does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorism itself. Although I'm sure they have must have secret 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information to which I am not privy, which would change my mind. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Otherwise, how could they sleep at night?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That was not my conclusion. My conclusion was that the very REAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats and risks of terrorism (and the damage it does, counting in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of lives and many hundreds of billions of dollars) are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better insurance for the ruling parties to retain leadership than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviet Union ever was. Who wants to risk voting in some unknown freaky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third party candidate when we have a 'war' to run?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So there is a vested interest in maintaining the sort of conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that give rise to anti-US organizations of militant or non-militant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bent,
</em><br>
<p>So you are implying that the Bush administration (and other
<br>
administrations) have an incentive to make progress in the
<br>
war against terrorism---so that they'll be re-elected---
<br>
but not *too* much progress, or else the &quot;ruling leadership&quot;
<br>
won't be able to retain power?
<br>
<p>But what if a chance to pass up capturing Osama Bin Laden
<br>
eventuated in a traceable terrorist attack the A-bombing
<br>
of Philadelphia?  Unless the &quot;ruling leadership&quot; was absolutely
<br>
certain that their easing up on terrorists was untraceable, 
<br>
then they'd be taking a terrible risk.
<br>
<p>Oh, now I recall.  President Clinton *did* pass up a chance
<br>
to get Osama, and no one is complaining too much.  But what
<br>
would happen if a Republican were to miss a chance to corral
<br>
a well known terrorist?  If it were at all traceable, all
<br>
hell would break loose!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, many other nations ruling parties have a vested interest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using an anti-US position and anti-US propaganda to maintain their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grips on power.
</em><br>
<p>But I think that this depends on the fundamental constituency
<br>
of the nation in question.  Yes, in Germany or France, one
<br>
certainly does not want to appear to be less anti-US than
<br>
the opposition, so there you are right.  But what about
<br>
Australia or Poland?
<br>
<p>You see, it is sometimes more easily explained conventionally
<br>
by such cynical interpretations.
