<em>&gt; Well, the East Coast (U.S.) people may have seen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this already, but I just saw it on the Tonight Show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the West Coast -- Arnold S. has announced that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  he *will* run to be the governor of California during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the recall election.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this may make politics interesting enough again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually  get people involved.  Boy, one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  imagine some interesting commercials for this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campaign (e.g. &quot;The Terminator&quot; will terminate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics as it has become, etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can someone who knows more constitutional law 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I answer the question of whether or not Arnold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can become president (given that he was born 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside of the U.S.)?  [Thanks.]
</em><br>
<p>Well I know enough to do a sort of google then run a 
<br>
find on &quot;born&quot; anyway ;-)

<br>
The Constitution of the United States of America.
<br>
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html</a>
<br>
<p>Under Article II [The Presidency]
<br>
Section 1 [Election, Installation, Removal] 
<br>
<p>&quot;No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the 
<br>
United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution,
<br>
shall be eligible to the office of President; neither shall any
<br>
person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained
<br>
to the age of thirty five years, and been fourteen Years a
<br>
resident within the United States.&quot;
<br>
<p>So on my reading, (and contrary to what I thought I knew),
<br>
if Arnie is a US citizen  and has been a resident for 14 years
<br>
he is not precluded.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>[And as a *complete* aside :-) 
<br>
<p>Section 2[Impeachnent] includes the following
<br>
<p>'Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take
<br>
the following oath or affirmation:--&quot;I do solemnly swear
<br>
(or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President
<br>
of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, 
<br>
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the 
<br>
United States.&quot; 
<br>
<p>- &quot;To the best of my ability&quot; seems to be a pivotal phrase.
<br>
<p>Some *are* more &quot;able&quot; than others.
<br>
<p>Yet there is also the following to consider:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;In case of the removal of the President from office, or 
<br>
of his death, resignation, or inability (sic) to discharge the
<br>
powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve
<br>
on the Vice President, and the Congress may by law 
<br>
provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or 
<br>
inability, both of the President and Vice President,
<br>
declaring what officer shall then act as President, and 
<br>
such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be
<br>
removed, or a President shall be elected.&quot;
<br>
<p>So it seems the Congress could impeach a president 
<br>
and remove him (for gross incompetence). Although
<br>
such would be a pretty unlikely for (just say) a
<br>
republican congress given (just say) a republican 
<br>
president. ;-)
<br>
<p>Diversion over - sorry about that]
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
<br>
<p>[Who is now contemplating not just Arnie in the White
<br>
House but heck why not Jerry Springer?
<br>
<p>NB:   My political opinions are *entirely* my own and I 
<br>
&nbsp;DO NOT speak for ExI ]
