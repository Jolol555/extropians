<p>Not!  As I said a Extro 3 to survive over the long term one
<br>
needs a &quot;distributed replicated intelligence&quot; -- *BUT*
<br>
&quot;distribution&quot; of ones intelligence across a solar system
<br>
sized object (a Matrioshka Brain) does a pretty good job of this
<br>
(asteroids, commets, small black holes become &quot;minor&quot; concerns).
<br>
<p>But distributing ones intelligence across light years makes it
<br>
essentially &quot;impossible&quot; for Lee to function as a connected
<br>
intelligence.  So you seem to be suggesting that &quot;Lee&quot; is
<br>
a socialist or a communist and that he is colonizing for the
<br>
&quot;good&quot; of the very loosely connected collective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is, creating Lee II is a way to get more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run time for Lee I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't happen to agree with that, but losing track of what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been said before is exceptionally unproductive in these threads.
</em><br>
<p>No, the point I have been trying to make (it seems like over
<br>
and over again) is that Lee II *cannot* provide any &quot;return
<br>
on investment&quot; to Lee I.  The only reason that Lee I would
<br>
create Lee II is out of some desire to propagate and Lee I
<br>
would know that propagation eventually has negative consequences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If they had started with the assumption that GB or Spain would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually be defeated by *someone*, they might very well have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chosen to deliberately create the next set of winners.  You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent North America (or the intergalactic space) from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonized, but you can try to choose what sort do the colonization.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  Most people do not act out of a desire to produce their
<br>
replacements.  Sure you can have evolutionary drives but
<br>
any advanced civilization will have regulated those drives
<br>
(witness the declining populations in Japan and Europe).
<br>
Now one might produce &quot;offspring&quot; if it were clear that they
<br>
were not going to compete with you (i.e. the children of
<br>
advanced civilizations exit from the galaxy due to the
<br>
temperature and thermodynamics reasons I have suggested).
