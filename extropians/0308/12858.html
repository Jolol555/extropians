Physics Today recently published a very moving obituary for
<br>
Robert Forward.

Robert Lull Forward
<br>
<p>Physicist and science-fiction author Robert Lull Forward died on 21
<br>
September 2002 in Seattle, Washington, from brain cancer. A leader
<br>
in gravitational radiation astronomy and advanced space propulsion,
<br>
he contributed particularly to gravitational and inertial sensors
<br>
and low-loss electronics.
<br>
<p>Forward was born on 15 August 1932 in Geneva, New York. He obtained
<br>
his BS in physics from the University of Maryland in 1954, an MS in
<br>
applied physics from UCLA in 1958, and his PhD from the University
<br>
of Maryland in 1965. For his thesis, he built and operated the first
<br>
bar antenna for gravitational wave detection; he did this work under
<br>
the direction of Joseph Weber and David Zipoy. His antenna was on
<br>
display in a Smithsonian Institution museum and is now in storage
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>Beginning in 1956 and for the next 31 years, Forward worked at the
<br>
Hughes Aircraft Research Laboratories in Malibu, California, rising
<br>
to senior scientist on the director's staff. In his early years at
<br>
Hughes, he invented and developed gravitational radiation detectors
<br>
and explored many new ideas in space applications. One such
<br>
invention was the rotating cruciform gravity gradiometer mass
<br>
detector, which measures Earth's subsurface mass variations or
<br>
gravitational multipole moments. In 1960, he was the first to point
<br>
out that a laser interferometer gravity-wave detector could be built
<br>
to be photon noise limited, and that scaling it up would make
<br>
extreme events in the universe detectable.
<br>
<p>Retirement for Forward was a simply a new category of innovation and
<br>
activity. He took early retirement in 1987 and founded Forward
<br>
Unlimited. The appropriately named company emphasized space
<br>
propulsion methods, including using laser- and microwave-driven
<br>
sails and antimatter propulsion for high velocities.
<br>
<p>Through his concepts for matter and antimatter rockets and laser-
<br>
and microwave-driven sails, he explored the only technically
<br>
credible ways of sending probes to the stars; such craft can reach
<br>
speeds necessary for those vast gulfs. His book Mirror Matter:
<br>
Pioneering Antimatter Physics (Wiley, 1988), written with Joel
<br>
Davis, presents his ideas on matter and antimatter rockets.
<br>
<p>In 1992, Forward formed Tethers Unlimited Inc with Robert Hoyt. The
<br>
company specializes in innovations for space travel using elegant
<br>
mechanical methods. He retired again just before his death.
<br>
<p>Forward's written work consists of 157 technical publications and 71
<br>
popular science articles. His 14 book-length works include science
<br>
fact and science fiction. His best known novels are Dragon's Egg
<br>
(Ballantine, 2000), which is about life on a neutron star and is
<br>
still used in astrophysics courses, and Rocheworld (Baen Books,
<br>
1990), which is based on his concept for propulsion using
<br>
laser-driven sails. He was among the most rigorous of the &quot;hard&quot;
<br>
science fiction writers. His best nonfiction summary work is
<br>
Indistinguishable From Magic (Baen Books, 1995), based on Arthur C.
<br>
Clarke's Third Law, &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is
<br>
indistinguishable from magic.&quot;
<br>
<p>Elegance of concept marked his many inventions; in all, Forward
<br>
obtained 20 patents. Orbital tethers will be both graceful and
<br>
useful. In a long series of papers, many with Hoyt, he calculated
<br>
how light cables could be used to transfer energy and momentum
<br>
between spacecraft; that effort opened new methods of orbit
<br>
changing. Cables carrying electrical currents can raise or lower
<br>
orbits by using the J ? B force, available from Earth's magnetic
<br>
field. Forward believed that antimatter could provide the most
<br>
fundamental method of containing energy. In the 1980s, he published
<br>
18 issues of his privately circulated journal, Mirror Matter
<br>
Newsletter, to stimulate the field. He saw how magnetic traps could
<br>
make antimatter useful in medicine, principally in tumor treatment.
<br>
<p>Forward lived up to his name: His thinking was well ahead of his
<br>
time, and he was known for a positive, supportive, and playful
<br>
manner. We knew him primarily as a pioneer of beam-driven sails, but
<br>
he had a thousand other interests. Some of his papers have amusing
<br>
titles, such as &quot;Laser Weapon Target Practice With Gee-Whiz
<br>
Targets.&quot; He fancied wearing colorful vests to go with his exciting
<br>
ideas, concepts nonetheless developed with full conservative
<br>
scientific rigor. Knowing of his fatal illness, he devoted his last
<br>
months to writing out his newest, partially explored scientific
<br>
ideas.
<br>
<p>Of Forward's many innovations, some were realized in his life, but
<br>
most will likely emerge in 21st-century space propulsion and
<br>
gravitational wave detection. Now that the first solar sails are
<br>
about to be launched and plans are being made to beam microwaves at
<br>
them to demonstrate photon propulsion, Forward's ideas are starting
<br>
to become real. He was fond of saying that he wrote science fiction
<br>
to advance ideas that he couldn't get into the scientific journals.
<br>
He usually coupled his science-fiction writing to his science papers
<br>
and thus gave concepts a wider publicity and advanced public
<br>
understanding of what the consequences of these ideas could mean.
