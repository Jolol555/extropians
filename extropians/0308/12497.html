</em><br>
<em>&gt; I used the word &quot;extropians&quot; in a serious discussion recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and once again was reminded that extropians sound like goofy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultists. 
</em><br>
<p>To some people, this is undoubtedly true, but any new idea or set of ideas
<br>
may sound goofy when it's new.  (I'll address whether extropianism is &quot;new,&quot;
<br>
a matter you question in another post, in the other thread you started.)
<br>
&nbsp;Only time will tell whether an idea that is considered &quot;goofy&quot; when it
<br>
is new will become less so over time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would be the best answer to someone who would say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the primo body and mind uploading  are allegoric figures that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists and extropians are offering that permits to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fantasm a body removed from it's attaches with the present, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the here and now, impossible bodies, wich makes them promoter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an ascetic ideal, who hates the body and the flesh (and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are possibly even worse than christians at it,  with their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; angels without  nose or phallus) and consequently alienation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (alienation is to be understood here as &quot;being estranged to oneself&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>This isn't a new allegation against transhumanist ideas, and one that I
<br>
think has been answered well by others both in years past and in response
<br>
to this post.  My short answer is that there are a number of assumptions
<br>
in the proposed indictment, each of which have to be addressed separately,
<br>
and none of which stand up to close scrutiny.  The first and most important
<br>
is whether the projections of possible &quot;future bodies&quot; transhumanists talk
<br>
about are &quot;impossible.&quot;  Of course, there is wide range of such projects,
<br>
from the simplest and most straightforward kinds of augmentation with near-term
<br>
technology (already achieved, really, by nascent cyborgs such as people
<br>
in wheelchairs, people who use various existing prosthetics, etc), to more
<br>
radical genetic and biochemical and biomechanical augmentation, through
<br>
conceptions such as more or less complete uploads.  All of these things
<br>
seem &quot;possible&quot; to me, although WHEN they may be possible is open to question
<br>
and discussion.  So the first reply is that the &quot;bodies&quot; we discuss aren't
<br>
impossible -- they just aren't possible YET.
<br>
<p>The second point is whether there's some kind of &quot;denial of the flesh&quot; going
<br>
on in transhumanism and extropianism.  I would certainly say not, although
<br>
there is a definite strain of &quot;mentalism&quot; in some of the discussion of the
<br>
more advanced kinds of uploading that one could read a kind of &quot;anticarnic&quot;
<br>
(to coin a term) desire into.  Speaking for myself, it's precisely because
<br>
I DO enjoy the pleasures that flesh and mind together offer that I consider
<br>
myself an extropian and a transhumanist.  I like life and want more of it
<br>
for a longer period of time.  
<br>
<p>Question: When a person who happens to be a quadriplegic works to restore
<br>
the functioning of his limbs, is he in some kind of &quot;denial of his flesh?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;In a sense, yes: He's in denial of his flesh AS IT IS.  He wants BETTER
<br>
FLESH.  The thing that defines transhumanism and extropian thought is the
<br>
rejection of the &quot;natural human&quot; as the limit on what we can be, just as
<br>
the quadriplegic rejects his immobile state as a limit.
<br>
<p>I -- and many other transhumanists and extropians I know are far from &quot;promoters
<br>
of an ascetic ideal:&quot; We like to have fun with our bodies and want to have
<br>
more fun with better bodies and better minds.
