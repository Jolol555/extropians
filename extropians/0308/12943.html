Unfortunately Larry seemed to feel unhappy with some aspects of Alcor. He had come to us from a very large, well-funded paramedic facility where he had been better compensated. Apparently he nursed a grudge to such an extent that he provided a reporter at Sports Illustrated with confidential information which seemed calculated to damage Alcor as much
<br>
as possible.

(end)
<br>
<p>I'm still in shock over this.  Larry Johnson's actions may create the greatest storm Alcor has faced since the Dora Kent affair.  And as with that incident, I am convinced Alcor in the end will be vindicated.  But getting to that point may be a very long and hard road.

<p>Dr. Jerry Lemler and his staff will need all the legal, financial and emotional support they can get.  And with Dr. Lemler fighting for his life against cancer, this could not have happened at a worst time.
<br>
<p>best wishes,
