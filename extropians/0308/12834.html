In a message dated 8/11/2003 2:24:15 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:robblin@thetip.org?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">robblin@thetip.org</a> writes: Maybe.  Perhaps the very fact that we us American Money commits 
<br>
us to using slave-labor.  I know it commits us to wars and economic policies 
<br>
that are predatory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;##Robbie, it sounds as if you have an agenda that you haven't put 
<br>
before the house.  In addition you are making gratuitous statements without 
<br>
offering either evidence or basis.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;### Then you continue to quote me, &quot;Perhaps sometimes there is no 
<br>
alternative but most times there seems to be.&quot;  And you continue with your reply, 
<br>
&quot;You do what you can, no doubt, but this doesn't make the overarching problem 
<br>
magically go away.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;###Did I mention magic?  I suggested that you have here a collection 
<br>
of very intelligent and knowledgeable people.  These people can spread the meme 
<br>
of not buying the products of slave labor.  They also can keep up with who 
<br>
the slavemasters are.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;###And once again you quote me, &quot;In my opinion when we knowingly buy 
<br>
these products we are only the Morlocks of H. G. Wells. world living off 
<br>
someone elses misery.&quot;  And you reply, &quot;Definitely, assuming we could reasonably be 
<br>
expected to KNOW that we are and that we have a CHOICE in the matter.&quot;  I know 
<br>
of nothing that prevents you from knowing that products from particular 
<br>
countries are from slave labor products.  I am sure a phone call to any 
<br>
international union headquarters would get you a list that would be astounding for its 
<br>
completeness.  As to your insinuation that we don't have choice I have never had 
<br>
a salesclerk point a firearm at me and dictate what product choices I should 
<br>
make.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time time in my misspent young adulthood I worked for a 
<br>
manufacturer of ladies hairrollers and orther hair care products.  We knew that a 
<br>
shyster had sold a bunch of hairrollers of a particular color in Arizona and that 
<br>
as a result Arizonians just wouldn't have anything to do with a hair roller 
<br>
of that color.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if an American Hairroller company can be that sensitive to the 
<br>
color of its product in certain markets then people that do purchasing for retail 
<br>
outlets can be just as sensitive and in fact they are.  So the last thing we 
<br>
need is another layer of big brother looking out for us.  All we have to do is 
<br>
remember we are leaders and start being leaders.
<br>
