</em><br>
<p>Have you been actually listening to what the man says?  If he doesn't have the 
<br>
power then he certainly doesn't disagree with much of anything that is being 
<br>
done.  Quite the opposite.  If you believe the job has no real power then why 
<br>
do we even bother with presidental elections?    Ever head of executive 
<br>
orders?   The president actually has a great deal of power and it can do a 
<br>
great deal of damage in the hands of the wrong person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes he has spent a lot of money on the military.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No he hasn't stepped up to the late on energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But really, the economy is it's own monster. It was slowing down prior to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush taking office. Sept. 11 didn;t help matters.
</em><br>
<p>The point is that Bush administration didn't do anything that helped either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sept 11 may have been an intelligence failure, but nothing is 100%. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many tips do they really get on terrorist plots? How many turn out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real? How much can you change an organization like our intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community in the 9 months that he had? You can;t shut down the airlines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every time someone threatens to attack our country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is more than a little material out there that his administration was 
<br>
briefed that something like this, something very much like 9/11, was in the 
<br>
works.    But in any case his administration has actively suppressed full and 
<br>
impartial investigation into much of 9/11.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think what we did in Afganistan was wrong. They had it coming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq is a different story, Saddam is a bastard who kills his own people by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thousands. He has needed to go for a long time. The world will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better place without him. Do the ends justify the means? I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I won't go into the rather strange &quot;they had it coming&quot; at this time.  Nobody 
<br>
said Saddam was a nice guy.  But spending the US into oblivion to kick butt 
<br>
in various parts of the MidEast to little good effect hardly seems the mark 
<br>
of a good leader.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tax cuts are not bad. It's simply a matter of letting everyone keep a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of their own hard-earned money rather than confiscating it. If we need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to balance the budget, we should be doing it by reducing our expenses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Tell it to Bush.  He is running the largest deficits ever.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not a big fan of Bush, especially the way he invokes &quot;God&quot; at every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity, but I think that this &quot;resume&quot; is rather juvenile and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serves to polarize those that already dislike him. The President only does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what he thinks he needs to do to get re-elected. That's the way the country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was set up. To fix our problems, we need to change the way the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think, not sit around and complain about our leaders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually it is not at all 'juvenile'.  What is juvenile at best is refusing to 
<br>
wake up and smell the coffeee.  It goes far beyond &quot;dislike&quot;.  The man and 
<br>
his administration have objectively done much that lead to the reasonable 
<br>
conclusion of that they are a tremendous menace to this country, to the world 
<br>
and to all our fondest extropic goals. 
<br>
<p>How do you &quot;fix how people think&quot; without putting out viewpoints such as this 
<br>
one you just called &quot;juvenile&quot;.  It was intended to get people to think and 
<br>
question.
