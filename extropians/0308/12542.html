</em><br>
<p>Which in theory wouldn't be too hard to do, although
<br>
it might still require pills (proteins can be
<br>
nanofactured; raw elements like sodium can not).  The
<br>
practical problem is finding the exact balance of
<br>
said nutrients.  It's not completely understood even
<br>
in the general population, and it tends to change
<br>
from person to person and in the same person (time of
<br>
day - for some, caffiene in the morning but not at
<br>
night - or extra vitamin C upon significant levels of
<br>
viruses in the blood).
<br>
<p>That's probably the major research block. 
<br>
Nanofacturing proteins can be done with cloned human
<br>
tissue - sealed inside the device if there is any
<br>
question of biocompatibility, and possibly needing
<br>
replacement every ten years or so.  Then again, if
<br>
you're accepting service appointments for the body,
<br>
then assuming 50% efficiency at producing energy as
<br>
glucose from electricity, how much does a
<br>
(100*(1/.5)*24*365=)1752 kWh set of batteries weigh,
<br>
and how practical would it be to leave such in a body
<br>
for a year?  Assuming some people couldn't be trusted
<br>
to recharge themselves, or the battery was not
<br>
rechargeable for some reason.  I suspect time-release
<br>
capsules of non-nanofacturable elements sufficient
<br>
for a year would less than double the battery's
<br>
weight and bulk, although water consumption would
<br>
still be necessary: storage for a year would be
<br>
prohibitively massive, construction would require a
<br>
source of hydrogen, and absorption of water vapor
<br>
likely would not produce enough for all-environment
<br>
use.
