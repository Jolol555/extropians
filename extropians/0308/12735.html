<p>A slot for science
<br>
<p><p>Weather, sports, and animals have their own cable television channels. Why 
<br>
not 24-hour science? | &lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:csoares@the-scientist.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20(SK)%20A%20slot%20for%20science">csoares@the-scientist.com</a>&gt;By Christine Soares
<br>
<p><p>Science is too important and the scientific process too complex to leave to 
<br>
the &quot;tyranny&quot; of the network news 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1991/june/prof_910610.html">http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1991/june/prof_910610.html</a>&gt;sound bite, 
<br>
contends a small California-based group trying to generate support for an 
<br>
entire television network devoted to unadulterated science. Modeling their 
<br>
proposed science channel on the nonprofit 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.c-span.org/">http://www.c-span.org/</a>&gt;Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN), 
<br>
the group is seeking seed money from investor angels or foundations to move 
<br>
forward with the idea whose time, they believe, has come.
<br>
<p>&quot;We now have more than 100 channels on cable, so it seems that to me there 
<br>
ought to be one of them devoted to some serious scientific discussion,&quot; 
<br>
said &lt;<a href="http://www.csntv.org/">http://www.csntv.org/</a>&gt;Terry Sejnowski, head of the Salk Institute's 
<br>
Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, who is serving as advisory board 
<br>
chair for the fledgling 
<br>
&quot;&lt;<a href="http://www.salk.edu/faculty/faculty/details.php?id=48">http://www.salk.edu/faculty/faculty/details.php?id=48</a>&gt;Cable Science 
<br>
Network&quot; (CSN) initiative.
<br>
<p>Sejnowski &lt;<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/pubmed/12893928">http://www.biomedcentral.com/pubmed/12893928</a>&gt;makes a case for 
<br>
the network in the August 1 issue of Science, citing stem cell research as 
<br>
just one example of topics for which public discussion and policymaking 
<br>
require in-depth information, and current science coverage is inadequate: 
<br>
&quot;The importance of timely scientific information was apparent in the 
<br>
debates in the United States last year on stem cell research: Speeches were 
<br>
given, positions taken, and decisions made based on simplistic and 
<br>
sensational interpretations of the underlying biology. The press failed to 
<br>
provide the scientific background, and the scientific community failed to 
<br>
provide forums to clarify the different types of stem cell research and the 
<br>
consequences of restricting research options.&quot;
<br>
<p>CSN is the brainchild of evolutionary neuroscientist Roger Bingham, a 
<br>
researcher at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://psy.ucsd.edu/chip/CBC2.html">http://psy.ucsd.edu/chip/CBC2.html</a>&gt;Center for Brain and Cognition and an 
<br>
awardwinning documentary producer. Bingham and his wife Linda, a fan of 
<br>
both science and C-SPAN, have put together a brief position paper 
<br>
describing the possible content of a 24-hour-a-day television network that 
<br>
would provide the kind of access to in-depth science information and 
<br>
discussion that C-SPAN's three channels collectively provide for politics.
<br>
<p>Bingham envisions offering a mix of high-end documentary material, such as 
<br>
the &quot;&lt;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/</a>&gt;NOVA&quot; series and a revival of 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1997/july/gwynne_p1_970721.html">http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1997/july/gwynne_p1_970721.html</a>&gt;Carl 
<br>
Sagan's &quot;Cosmos,&quot; with lectures, both historic and current, and talk shows. 
<br>
But the network would also carry a C-SPAN-esque assortment of unedited 
<br>
content, such as live speeches, debates, and congressional hearings.
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/bvl1">http://www.people.cornell.edu/pages/bvl1</a>&gt;Bruce V. Lewenstein, a professor 
<br>
of science communication at Cornell University and editor of the journal 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.sagepub.co.uk/journal.aspx?pid=105747">http://www.sagepub.co.uk/journal.aspx?pid=105747</a>&gt;Public Understanding of 
<br>
Science, wonders how much of an audience there would be for such a channel. 
<br>
&quot;Live science isn't very interesting,&quot; he said, and Bingham's CSN proposal 
<br>
&quot;has its heart in the right place, but it doesn't seem to recognize or 
<br>
speak to some of the constraints for 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.nap.edu/issues/19.4/yankelovich.html">http://www.nap.edu/issues/19.4/yankelovich.html</a>&gt;reaching the broad public 
<br>
with science information.&quot;
<br>
<p>The National Science Foundation's 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/seind02/c7/c7s4.htm#c7s4l2">http://www.nsf.gov/sbe/srs/seind02/c7/c7s4.htm#c7s4l2</a>&gt;latest annual survey 
<br>
of public attitudes toward science found that only 8% of respondents watch 
<br>
&quot;NOVA&quot; regularly, whereas 90% watch television news at least a few times a 
<br>
week. Even legislators are getting science information from TV news shows, 
<br>
according to the report, which noted that a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; segment on human 
<br>
cloning was shown at the start of a March 2001 House of Representatives 
<br>
subcommittee hearing on the topic.
<br>
<p>Lewenstein fears there might not be much of an appetite for the undigested 
<br>
science discussion that Bingham sees as a key element in the CSN mix. &quot;This 
<br>
is why I'm a little bit surprised that someone who's a very experienced 
<br>
television producer would be talking about putting out something raw and 
<br>
think that it's going to have appeal. That's the piece I'm curious about,&quot; 
<br>
Lewenstein said.
<br>
<p>Bingham, who has produced acclaimed PBS series including &quot;Frontiers of the 
<br>
Mind&quot; and &quot;The Human Quest,&quot; acknowledges that lovingly crafted 
<br>
documentaries represent one extreme in science communication and can be 
<br>
highly effective. &quot;But I also know how much stuff I left on the floor. I 
<br>
regretted a lot of the material that didn't make it onto the air,&quot; he said. 
<br>
&quot;And it's important to have a network that's free of the tyranny of the 
<br>
sound bite.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sejnowski notes that he has friends who are &quot;C-SPAN junkies&quot; precisely 
<br>
because of the channels' unscripted drama. &quot;They just put it on in the 
<br>
background and it's kind of like a soap opera&amp; I think it's really 
<br>
transformed public perception of what happens in Washington&amp; what it is 
<br>
that people actually do to make policy,&quot; he said. &quot;So I think one of the 
<br>
goals of CSN could be just to let the public know how science is done&amp; 
<br>
having scientists debate the issues and having the process of science 
<br>
exposed to the public.&quot;
<br>
<p>At present, only &lt;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/">http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/</a>&gt;NASA TV broadcasts 
<br>
a near-constant stream of educational programming and live transmissions 
<br>
from space missions. And several organizations, such as the UK-based 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.vega.org.uk/info/intro.html">http://www.vega.org.uk/info/intro.html</a>&gt;Vega Science Trust and the 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.mos.org/cst/section/presentation.html">http://www.mos.org/cst/section/presentation.html</a>&gt;Current Science and 
<br>
Technology Center in Boston, produce TV-ready lectures and discussions of 
<br>
timely science topics for broadcast by other television networks and on the 
<br>
Internet.
<br>
<p>But none of these sources rival the 24-hour reach of C-SPAN, which is 
<br>
funded by the cable television industry as a public service and is 
<br>
available to 85 million US households, with an 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.c-span.org/about/numbers.asp">http://www.c-span.org/about/numbers.asp</a>&gt;estimated weekly audience of 28 
<br>
million.
<br>
<p>Why C-SPAN itself doesn't offer science-related programming when public 
<br>
policy or legislation is at stake is a mystery to Sejnowski. He suspects 
<br>
the network's producers simply don't have the expertise to find the right 
<br>
sources, and he and Bingham would be happy to help.
<br>
<p>Bingham says he has had initial talks with C-SPAN and other &quot;nonprofit 
<br>
providers&quot; about developing some programming that could be a &quot;training 
<br>
wheels&quot; stage in building the CSN network. For example, he'd love to see a 
<br>
monthly installment of C-SPAN's 
<br>
&lt; <a href="http://www.booknotes.org/about/">http://www.booknotes.org/about/</a> &gt; Booknotes&quot; program devoted to interviews 
<br>
with authors of science books.
<br>
<p>Working with a small private grant, Bingham is circulating his position 
<br>
paper and putting together an advisory board. So far, Sejnowski and his 
<br>
wife Beatrice Golomb, a UCSD researcher, have signed on, as have V.S. 
<br>
Ramachandran; E.C. Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory; John Allman 
<br>
of the California Institute of Technology; Ann Druyan of Cosmos Studios; 
<br>
Paul MacReady of AeroVironment; and Michael Shermer, editor of Skeptic 
<br>
magazine.
<br>
<p>But as yet, &quot;there isn't any angel who finds this to be their life calling, 
<br>
where they want to make their imprint,&quot; Sejnowski said. &quot;There are a lot of 
<br>
very wealthy individuals right now who are looking around and who are young 
<br>
enough so they can get involved. This would be the perfect project for them.&quot;
