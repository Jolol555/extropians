</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>### I wasn't really able to understand your proposal here.
<br>
<em>&gt; -------------------

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Rafal's question is a valid one, &quot;Should he be prevented from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making an arbitrary exchange with consenting persons?&quot;  The answer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes - if you are exchanging human lives (perhaps any of the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which results from human lives), you should be prevented from making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ARBITRARY exchanges of that kind.  You should be prevented by those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally responsible for that person's being - themselves, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends and family, etc.
</em><br>
<p>### You seem to be using a taboo to reject a class of tradeoffs. You might
<br>
want to read Tetlock's article we discussed in the &quot;Taboos&quot; thread recently.
<br>
In effect you are arrogating to yourself the right to judge others, and to
<br>
bend their will to your ideas of what is good for them.
<br>
<p>Not nice, IMO.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Dialectical Ad Hominem for Rafal:  On Nike's slavery commitments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 seconds on google will get you all the information you need.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've been informed, the responsibility is now yours.  (first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cslnews/">http://www.geocities.com/cslnews/</a> ).  It did, after all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it to the supreme court.  WHY do you think that major US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations ship their labor oversees if not to take advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheaper labor?  Do you think that labor doesn't become inhumanely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap so as to be morally equivalent with slavery?
</em><br>
<p>### Well, yes, this exactly what I deny - slavery is slavery, cheap labor is
<br>
cheap labor. Nike is not a slave driver.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slavery is  vague word like other words &quot;fraud&quot; or &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;bald&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  The point is simply to recognize the underlying phenomena to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it refers (people who work for less than $.01/day and can't go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work someplace better or who are psychologically and/or politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated by their workplace so significantly that they can't leave.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can call THAT phenomena BAD or GOOD, that is our choice.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear to be calling it GOOD.  I call it BAD.  As for word choice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Slavery&quot; is the closest single-word that I could think of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously described the situation (lack of financial freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coupled with political/psychological domination transcending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generations), if you have a better word, I'm happy to use YOUR WORD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for THAT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BUT if you think that obfuscating this issue into an issue about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of words is going to CONVINCE THIS AUDIENCE, I sincerely hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're fooling yourself.
</em><br>
<p>### The following characteristics are true of slavery as defined by the
<br>
dictionary: All slaves are owned. All slaves are possessions. All slaves are
<br>
property. All slaves serve. All service by a slave is servitude. Or, as
<br>
described by Encarta, the definitive characteristics of slaves are as
<br>
follows:
<br>
Their labor or services are obtained through force;Their physical beings are
<br>
regarded as the property of another person, their owner; and They are
<br>
entirely subject to their owner's will.
<br>
<p>All other uses of the word in this context are empty rhetoric. You might not
<br>
make much headway with this approach, at least not on this list. This is not
<br>
alt.politics.socialism.
<br>
<p>Also, I would like to point out to you that, as is obvious to anybody who
<br>
read my posts, I do not consider the condition of having to labor for 1 cent
<br>
a day to be, as you wrote &quot;GOOD&quot;. I stated (and you jeeringly commented on
<br>
it) &quot;Poverty is wrong&quot;. Please do not try to demonize me be ascribing to me
<br>
a hatred and contempt for humanity.
<br>
<p>The adequate words to describe the plight of those who are paid little by
<br>
global companies for their labor in e.g. Burma, are &quot;poverty&quot;,
<br>
&quot;disenfranchisement&quot;, &quot;state oppression&quot;, and &quot;oligarchy&quot;. More global
<br>
investment is the best cure for these ailments.
<br>
