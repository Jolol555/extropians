### I see communitarian thinking, in-group protection, outgroup bashing
<br>
here. Where is the Extropian content?
<br>
<p>Would you deny me, Rafal Smigrodzki, a productive non-citizen, the benefit
<br>
(or maybe the right?) of bargaining for a mutually beneficial exchange of
<br>
services with American citizens?
