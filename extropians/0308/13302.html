<br>
<em>&gt; The standard keyphrase for this is &quot;distribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system&quot;.  Put simply: how do you get those stations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set up in the first place?  (Yes, there are gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stations now, but how do you pay for refitting those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the robots you mention prior to enough people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having these cars to make it economically viable?  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chicken-and-the-egg type problem.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree this is a problem, but it is a political problem not a technical
<br>
problem as was  the suggestion in the original post. Given the extant
<br>
political economy, I would favor some heavy tax brakes to help the
<br>
bootstrapping problem and let the market work out the details. Of course, I
<br>
imagine that there would be less of a need for such battery stations as
<br>
compared with gas stations, since most refueling would take place at home or
<br>
work. In this way, the infra structure heavily favors batteries over
<br>
fuel-cells.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having operated an EV1 before they were scrapped, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can tell you that your dream - in this regard - is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right-on.
</em><br>
<p>Lucky bastard!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted, I had to plug in every few nights
<br>
<em>&gt; (battery range over 100 miles, daily round-trip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commute under 50) or I'd be out of fuel, but it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an easy habit to get in to.  (I still remember a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend's joke about the power meter: an 11-bar gauge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing how full the battery was.  &quot;Bars of power&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounded a little like I was powering it with cocaine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or similar, but what else could one call it, simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough for daily usage?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the problems was, most people apparently did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (still do) much more than 100 miles of driving per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day, and in many cases, the only practical place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plug in was at home.  There were other chargers, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even 10% - probably not even 1% - as many per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit area as gas stations, and charging was a slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough process that it really had to be at some place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were going to be at for several hours - which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually meant work or home.
</em><br>
<p>I was under the impression that many of the ev1's (the lead acid ones) had a
<br>
110 charge option, which would mean you could plug in anywhere with outlet
<br>
where you could borrow a few amps? No?
