<p><em>&gt; On Sun Aug 03, 2003 02:41 am Lee Corbin speculated:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In less than a thousand years, the Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will probably be at the center of a civilization expanding at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the speed of light. By the same token, if there ever are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aliens in the skies of Earth, they will be from a civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (when they left it) about a thousand years ahead of ours.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have generally tended to agree with Lee's previous statement that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are alone and there are no aliens out there waiting to pounce on us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there is another alternative that I don't remember anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioning. Look around you. Old folk with a good pension or a pile of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assets don't do much. Sitting on your porch in a rocking chair seems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a good deal to them. It is the young who haven't made their pile 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who rush around 'doing' things.
</em><br>
<p>I think that it's extremely important for us to question
<br>
the inevitability of senescence and death.
<br>
<p>NOTHING is more important than uprooting the notions
<br>
that we must die.  I would urge you to check out in
<br>
more detail the writings of Max More, and Mike Perry
<br>
---the latter in his great book &quot;Forever For All&quot;.
<br>
<p>More specifically, exactly *why*, we must ask, are
<br>
those old people sitting around in their rocking
<br>
chairs?  Are they making an aesthetic statement of
<br>
some kind?  No.  The infirmities of old age are
<br>
directly traceable to degeneration of the nervous
<br>
system and wearing out of other body parts.  THIS
<br>
IS POTENTIALLY CORRECTABLE.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now if you add together increased lifespans, reducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birthrates, the need to be 'safe' (to protect your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vastly increased lifespan) then the outcome seems clear.
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p>1. The &quot;increased lifespans&quot; must be and will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accompanied by increased vitality and increased
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambition.
<br>
<p>2. &quot;Reduced birthrate&quot;????? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never! The whole cosmos beckons to us to bring
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life to it, and whether by copying, or by Von
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neumann probes, by or old fashioned colonization,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we must do.
<br>
<p>3. &quot;Safety&quot;.  Yes, that is high on the agenda of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone who wants to keep on living.  But in this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regard we must emulate nature, who guarantees
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life extension by flooding all available niches
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with ever more life.  Earth must become the source
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of trillions of spoors carrying copies of us and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifeforms of all of the most advanced kinds that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we can engineer to the very ends of our infinite
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An OLD population with very few (or even none) young entities won't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually 'do' very much. You might think now that you will want to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lots of exciting research, world-shaping projects, etc., but the future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality will be very different. It's rather like a self-confident young 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man stating with supreme assurance that 'marriage and kids won't change 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me in the slightest'.
</em><br>
<p>Sadly, the reality for me and perhaps for you will probably
<br>
be just as you say.  We may have probably been born too soon.
<br>
But that is *no* reason to adopt a defeatist philosophy!
<br>
<p>Anyway, I *will* want to continue to delight in understanding,
<br>
and, were I only able to muster the intelligence, the knowledge,
<br>
and the energy, then I also *would* be among those doing research
<br>
and exploring the galaxies.
<br>
<p>Well, why not?  What is physically impossible about *me* having
<br>
unlimited energy?  It's just a matter of the application of
<br>
intelligence, and the sun at present supplies vastly more
<br>
energy than would be required.  All I need to do is live
<br>
long enough, and somehow survive this century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There might well be thousands of alien civilizations out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, but they are all doing the vastly advanced equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sitting on their front porch in their rocking chairs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watching the universe go by.
</em><br>
<p>The word &quot;all&quot; should have tipped you off to your error.
<br>
Some humans will become immortal.  Some thinking entities
<br>
will colonize (and as Tipler says &quot;engulf&quot;) the universe.
<br>
<p>We need at every turn to spread and support memes to
<br>
foster this ambition within ourselves.  It's why I
<br>
am an Extropian.
<br>
