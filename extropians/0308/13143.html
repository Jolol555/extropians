<em>&gt; Alright.  Damien posted a message reporting on how many people are

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nicq, do you know for sure that this is the case?  It
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; scoundrels who commit crimes.  (I mean real ones,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In point of fact we are all aware of a great number of crimes that should not 
<br>
be crimes that add to the incarceration rate.  Most of us are also aware that 
<br>
some of the automatic mandatory sentencing practices are unfair and also 
<br>
increase the active incarceration number.   It is least likely that we are 
<br>
better at catching scoundrels.  Our conviction rate and percentage of solved 
<br>
crimes lags that of other countries with a lower incarceration rate.    I 
<br>
hope we get a LOT better at know what is and isn't real crime and preventing 
<br>
it.
