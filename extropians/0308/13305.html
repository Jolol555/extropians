<em>&gt; Such quibbles can be used by a wily opponent to advance his position  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transhumanist, perhaps under the pretext of &quot;saving the spirit of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society&quot;, or similar gobbledygook. It might be better to stick to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler argument - killing a lot of people by denying them rejuvenation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment they want and can afford, is mass murder, and as such prima  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad, even if not genocidal.
</em><br>
<p>It's good not to get too deeply involved in reality and the meaning of  
<br>
life and death, because you might discover that what you want is not  
<br>
physical immortality at all.
<br>
<p>Cf. Reasons and Persons, Derek Parfit
<br>
<a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/textbooks/booksearch/</a>

<br>
<p>Parfit isn't a True Believer but he still gives good reasons, for  
<br>
instance, not to always do whatever you believe to be rationally best  
<br>
for yourself.  Even though those things might sound &quot;prima facie&quot; good,  
<br>
it's not clear that they are.  Parfit isn't a sophist.  This would  
<br>
include things like preventing potential genocides and your own death.
<br>
<p>But you may have a moral imperative to die.  It may be the best  
<br>
possible thing you could do - to actually be brave.  There certainly  
<br>
are prima facie obvious cases where bravery would demand self-sacrifice  
<br>
and if one took bravery to be among the highest of human moral  
<br>
abilities, then one would think that making a world in which people  
<br>
could be brave would be a high moral priority for people who are trying  
<br>
to decide whether to make a world in which people live forever or in  
<br>
which they die.
<br>
<p>If you think it's sophistry, try to rewrite human morality without  
<br>
bravery and say genuinely to yourself that you want to want THAT.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
