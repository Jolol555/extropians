</em><br>
<p>### Give me your arguments in favor of this possibility.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This would
<br>
<em>&gt; lead to a radical lack of innovation and a stagnation of production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values.    To get around this I think you will need to come up with a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagrees with current ruling thought and practice has room to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop and come to sufficient fruition for the system to change and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Indeed, it is conceivable that an authoritarian system with full thought
<br>
transparency would suffer from technological stagnation, compared to a
<br>
pluralistic, volition-based system with the same thought-reading capacity.
<br>
This is substantially identical to the comparison of communist authoritarian
<br>
states and the semi-pluralistic ones during the last century - stagnation
<br>
occurred in the former because of, among other things, poorly informed
<br>
centralized decision makers excluding alternative solutions, while the
<br>
pluralists could tolerate internal disagreement, without suppression of
<br>
valuable alternatives.
<br>
<p>Please note that the disagreements between competing players in pluralist
<br>
societies are open, transparent, and yet the systems as a whole can tolerate
<br>
them, is not harmed by present levels of openness, and its ability to
<br>
reconcile conflict would not be harmed by even more openness. The essence of
<br>
the issue is not the exact level of transparency, but the ability to deal
<br>
with internal conflict. Whoever does it better, wins.
<br>
<p>With thought transparency, the authoritarian systems would also be overtaken
<br>
and in due course destroyed by pluralistic ones.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't see where this would lead to economic sufficiency any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the group mindedness of various socialized economies led to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater efficiency. How would the lack of private thought and deed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve the picture precisely?
</em><br>
<p>### Simple. No lies, no lying politicians, no thieves, no cheating in
<br>
school, workplace, store, restaurant. No money spent on unnecessary car
<br>
repairs. Drastic reductions in violent crime, fraud. Cheaper everything. No
<br>
Bush lying about WMD. 200 000 000 000 $ saved right there.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is your decision then arbitrary?  Because you don't seem to be fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presenting your reasons for it.  Nor do you seem interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing how it will not lead to dystopia.   How is this responsible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### I am not attempting to prove that thought transparency will not lead to
<br>
dystopia (except as a side argument), merely express a belief that thought
<br>
transparency, if technically possible, will be implemented (or one might
<br>
say, will implement itself) because of competitive pressures, independently
<br>
of our wishes.
