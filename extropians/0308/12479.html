<p>A strict reading of these rules would suggest that it is okay for me to

advocate the assassination of Robert Bradbury, but not to insult him. 
<br>
This is actually a logically possible interpretation of what you said, 
<br>
i.e., it is okay to calmly and politely call for a fellow list member's 
<br>
assassination and then debate the idea, but not to insult someone or call 
<br>
them names.  Would you agree with this?  (Lest anyone mistake me, I am 
<br>
emphatically not calling for the assassination of Robert Bradbury or 
<br>
anyone else.  I won't say that killing *never* solves anything, but its 
<br>
power to improve the human condition is far less than commonly thought.)
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you're calling for total openness, and yet 
<br>
simultaneously placing a restriction on speech.  Personally I would hope 
<br>
that someday, people will be free to say anything they damn well please, 
<br>
and people will also be free to be offended and say so in no uncertain 
<br>
terms, and, yes, besmirch the character of the person they dislike.  If 
<br>
you enjoy, on mailing lists, that form of local politeness which calls for 
<br>
not posting offended reactions, why is that particular custom okay, but 
<br>
not that alternate form of politeness which calls for not advocating 
<br>
genocide?  Are they not both restrictions on speech?  On SL4 I don't 
<br>
hesitate to impose both restrictions, in the name of preserving the 
<br>
glorious Signal and triumphing over Noise.
