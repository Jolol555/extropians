<em>&gt; The NY Times has an interesting article by Kristof regarding

<em>&gt; how America may be becoming more religious (in a state that

<em>&gt; It would be interesting to speculate how much the &quot;run-up&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the singularity might be driving people into a &quot;haven&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancient ideas because they fear the unknown of the future.

<p><p><p>INteresting subject.  I am also fairly sure that a trend of increasing 
<br>
agnosticism started to die sometime in the 60s. It may seem strange now, but 
<br>
in those days there were actually movies that seriously questioned the 
<br>
existence of a god, and that had characters who were atheists. Look at the 
<br>
movie The Sandpiper starring Burton and Taylor.  This was not an art house 
<br>
film.  That has all died out now. 
<br>
<p>I suspect it has something to do with the consolidation of news and 
<br>
entertainment productions.  You have huge conglomerations that produce news 
<br>
and films and TV shows.  They are highly profit driven. This may have been 
<br>
also influenced by the movement of so many people to the cities, and at teh 
<br>
same time, the dying out of almost all of the newspapers in cities, except 
<br>
for one winner.
<br>
<p>In a way, our media has become like our presidential politics--aimed to the 
<br>
lowest common denominator, which is the religious believer.  And so this 
<br>
stance reinforces itself.
<br>
<p>But I think the internet will gradually reverse the current trend. Already it 
<br>
is taking time away from TV and movies.
