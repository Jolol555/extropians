<a href="mailto:cryofan@mylinuxisp.com?Subject=Re:%20would%20you%20vote%20for%20this%20man?">cryofan@mylinuxisp.com</a> writes: Bush and his GOP henchmen, like Gore and his Democrat 
<br>
henchmen, see our nation simply as a pawn in their lust for power.  As far as I can 
<br>
tell, this attitude runs rampant in the Halls of Power in a completely 
<br>
BI-PARTISAN fashion.  
<br>
<p>Randy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally someone I almost totally agree with.  But I don't see this as 
<br>
starting on Bush's or Clinton's watch.  IMHO we are suffering from an 
<br>
accumulation of bad law and government decisions that go back as far as forty years.  
<br>
Just notice, the corporations are moving overseas because they are tired of 
<br>
dealing with the IRS, CIO, AFL, OSHA, and all the other agencies.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what happened to the tobacco companies when they quit donating 
<br>
to the Dems after the 94 election.
<br>
