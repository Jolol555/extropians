<p>Umbrellas, like some other objects, are tools that provide imperfect
<br>
protection in certain relatively uncommon situations.  Wouldn't it
<br>
seem awfully peculiar to live in a place where umbrellas were not
<br>
allowed unless one had a permit to carry one?  In the case that
<br>
virtually all umbrella uses were to keep the rain off oneself, would
<br>
it not appear that any umbrella-ban is going to have the primary
<br>
effect of causing people to be wet who would otherwise have been dry?
<br>
<p>I'm not sure umbrellas are defining parts of Mike's worldview either,
<br>
except insofar as the act of banning them suggests that someone wants
<br>
him to get wet.
<br>
<p>I don't actually speak for Mike, of course, but that's my view. :)
