<em>&gt; &gt; Excellent post! Right in line with my recent thoughts. This really

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has helped lead to the increasing age at which one may draw SS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefits (was 62, now 65, soon to be 67). We need to take a look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what we are doing, and decrease the SS eligible age even if we have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greatly reduce benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, but governments are not trying to increase the official
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retirement age because of neoconservative propaganda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that the money is running out.
</em><br>
<p><p>Excellent point. But WHY is the money running out? You have bought into 
<br>
another neoconservation progaganda point. Yes, the money is running, but not 
<br>
because it has been given to the pensioners. There was always enough money to 
<br>
support the retirement of the taxpayers who FUNDED the social safety 
<br>
networks. 
<br>
<p>The problem is really that we have failed to maintain control of our 
<br>
governments. They have gotten too distant from us, and now they see us as 
<br>
their livestock, instead of their bosses.  
<br>
<p>Many of the govts of the western democracies have used the funds meant for 
<br>
pensions to instead provide perks for 3rd world immigrants and other 
<br>
noncitizens--in order to help attract them.  
<br>
<p>I live in a city full a million of such immigrants, most of whom buy their 
<br>
food using in part an electronic card. I know. I wait in line behind them.
<br>
<p>Who do you think pays for these cards? You and me through our Social Secuity 
<br>
taxes. These govts are in collusion with other large and powerful entities 
<br>
(business and media) that want ever more people crammed into the country. And 
<br>
we pay for the enticements.
<br>
<p>Also, much of the SS tax money goes to special educational programs, such as 
<br>
bilingual education, and a veritable HOST of meaningless and worthless 
<br>
education and welfare seminars etc etc etc.  This stuff is bleeding our 
<br>
pension funds dry.  Our legion of govts from federal to local are out of 
<br>
control.
<br>
<p>Early retirement is an extremely extropian goal, as shown by this inescapable 
<br>
evidence.  But what a surprise--we still have to consider old fashioned 
<br>
politics in order to consider attaining these goals. How mundane.....
