<a href="mailto:rafal@smigrodzki.org?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">rafal@smigrodzki.org</a> writes: PS. I guess I shouldn't be so derisive and emotional. Sorry, I

find xenophobia and tribalism too revolting. Better I'll just shut up
<br>
<p>Rafal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that I think we are all missing the point.  In anticipating 
<br>
the future we have a choice between two predictions as to what is happening 
<br>
and is going to happen:
<br>
1.  The Singularity.
<br>
2.  A new Renaissance as predicted by Mike McGee -- see his book 
<br>
Technaissance.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imho both of those will be driven by the empowerment by what THE BELL 
<br>
CURVE calls the GT (do I have the right term?)  It appears that in the first 
<br>
Renaissance enough of the most intelligent segment of the society were 
<br>
empowered to drive the advancement that occurred.  However not all GT were empowered 
<br>
at that time, many just kept on digging ditches as they had before.  At this 
<br>
time according to THE BELL CURVE an additional group of GT are being empowered.  
<br>
It appears to me that this group is once again driving our advancement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what I have just written is true then we will indeed have a new 
<br>
Renaissance as Mike McGee predicts is happening.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it the difference between a Renaissance and the Singularity 
<br>
depends on the power of the additional GT and/or the availability of AI.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I totally agree with McGee when he predicts that the time ahead 
<br>
will be full of turmoil.  Heck, according to what I read we are already having 
<br>
board room wars in our organizations.  The old money can no longer manage the 
<br>
complex organizations and business that result from our high tech economy.  The 
<br>
new boys and girls that now have to run those organizations don't want to do 
<br>
it as hired hands that strictly follow orders as to goals -- they are fighting 
<br>
for a share of control.  You can bet that later they will demand majority 
<br>
control
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafal, let me come now to what I think is the point.  You and the 
<br>
others on this list are basically the &quot;New boys and girls&quot; that are, as a group, 
<br>
driving the changes now going on whether those changes characterize a 
<br>
Renaissance or the approach of the Singularity.  What kind of a world do you want it to 
<br>
be and what do you intend to do.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you be willing to follow a great leader that hands down orders 
<br>
for the rest of us to follow?  Will you agree to go on being regulated from 
<br>
Washington, Peking, etc.?
<br>
