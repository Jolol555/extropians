<p><em>&gt; &gt; I do not see what safety has to do with it.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Distributed Replicated Intelligence&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A human brain cannot avoid the hazard function imposed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an earthquake, an asteroid, etc.  However, if you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundant subcomponents distributed across 25 AU you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trump those hazard functions.  It is basic &quot;fault tolerance&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in computing data center configurations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that figures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example do you want to &quot;think&quot; about a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some other SI in the galaxy solved 20,000 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even 2,000,000,000 years ago???
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely, if the answer has been misplaced.
<br>
(Of course, we are talking about an era in which
<br>
gratification may be obtained in any way wished,
<br>
so there is a higher, aesthetic sense driving the
<br>
selection of problems.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, and getting back to another issue, *this* is why we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be so appealing for the beings of [Tralfamador] to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; colonize: we have plenty of unused cm^3s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Lee, you are oversimplifying -- to use those cm^3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one needs (a) energy sources; (b) certain types of matter;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (c) someplace to dump the waste heat.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, thank you for the reminder.  I do lose sight of that
<br>
now and then.  I don't think it affects my conclusions,
<br>
however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One would anticipate that *if* one were going to colonize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one would select optimal locations with a mix of those 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources.
</em><br>
<p>Cannot quite agree: in the image I have of what will
<br>
happen, one will colonize everything.  And that is true
<br>
whether the remote matter ought to be considered to be
<br>
a version of oneself or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have not changed my mind.  Lee II's are a hazard -- but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps naturally only over billions to trillions of years.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I do tend to ignore &quot;threats&quot; from others that won't
<br>
materialize in a long time.  (It's much as if I were stranded
<br>
on a desert island with 10 other people and enough supplies
<br>
for 30 years.)  We have to have a *discount factor* operating
<br>
here in your value calculations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it is *very* difficult to replace a component in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remote star system if it is allowed to rise to your level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of development.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder why it is that I don't worry about that and you
<br>
do?  I assume that distant people (even in L.A.) probably
<br>
aren't going to turn into threats in the foreseeable or
<br>
unforeseeable future.  There is a lot of living to do without
<br>
such arcane concerns.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even at light speed its 8 years round trip for information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to/from the Alpha Centauri system -- how do you deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that has 10^42 OPS for 8 years (~10^51 OPS) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out how to defend against something you may send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or it may send against you?
</em><br>
<p>Well, criticize this: they indeed have got a Jupiter brain
<br>
going there just as the solar system has its.  I dismiss
<br>
the threat of *physical* aggression because the distances
<br>
are too great, and the size and sophistication of the
<br>
invaders would have to be too superior.  But algorithms
<br>
are another story.  I have always pictured a &quot;Wind from
<br>
Earth&quot; in the sense of frighteningly superior algorithms
<br>
that local matter may or may not run as they are received
<br>
electromagnetically.  (You have stated that there are 
<br>
probably quickly arrived at upper limits to how advanced
<br>
matter will get, and my statements here are modulo that.)
<br>
<p>Either you do not run these algorithms (and do not attempt
<br>
to incorporate them into yourself)---and run the risk of
<br>
falling further and further behind---or you do run them,
<br>
and run the risk of having your identity changed a lot and
<br>
in ways you don't anticipate.  The evolutionary struggle
<br>
never really ceases.
<br>
<p>But it would be silly for a local intelligence to seriously
<br>
diminish its standard of living by spending resources attempting
<br>
to anticipate and prevent developments at Alpha Centauri.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Who wrote that?  From the heading it appears to be Robert,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but then if so he is referring to himself in the third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is me talking about myself in the 3rd person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, I should have perhaps added a :-).
</em><br>
<p>Okay, and I probably should have read some &quot; :-) &quot;s into 
<br>
there, but attribution is not done as responsibly in general
<br>
as in the good old days, and I was just worried.
<br>
