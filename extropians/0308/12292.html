I haven't been keeping up with this issue in the media, but I thought this 
<br>
would be of interest to those here who've been discussing it;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why 'Terrordaq' will come - if the Pentagon likes it or not
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3115777.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3115777.stm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Plans to set up a stock market for tip-offs about terrorism have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shelved by the US Government. But that won't stop someone else setting it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up - and may not even stop Osama bin Laden being able to make cash out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;betting on his own whereabouts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The disgust was impossible to avoid. A leaked report from a unit within 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Pentagon which had the job of finding imaginative solutions to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;threat of terrorism had proposed setting up a market which traded in tips, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whispers and sensitive intelligence.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The theory was that the free market might have ways of winkling out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sensitive information that conventional sources could not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         THE BASICS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People bet on the likelihood of an event, eg an attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With better information, traders are more likely to make money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's in traders' interests to find inside tips, secret sources etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Authorities could monitor sudden movements in the market, and take action 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But the backlash to the idea came almost before the lash itself. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Ridiculous and grotesque&quot; said one US senator. Another claimed he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;couldn't convince people it wasn't a hoax. The plug was pulled on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;screens at the innocuously titled Policy Analysis Market before it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even open for business.
</em><br>
