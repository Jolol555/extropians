<em>&gt;What would be the best answer to someone who would say that the primo body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and mind uploading  are allegoric figures that transhumanists and extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are offering that permits to fantasm a body removed from it's attaches with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the present, the here and now, impossible bodies, wich makes them promoter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of an ascetic ideal, who hates the body and the flesh (and are possibly even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worse than christians at it,  with their angels without  nose or phallus)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and consequently alienation (alienation is to be understood here as &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;estranged to oneself&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>This is a good question and one often raised by intelligent opponents of
<br>
the transhumanist project. Good responses are required.
<br>
<p>A glib answer might be to ask why it does not apply with equal force to
<br>
anyone who has work done on their decayed teeth, takes vitamin and other
<br>
nutritional supplements, antibiotics and perhaps mood-altering prescription
<br>
pharmaceutics, or (if old and ill) is fitted with an artificial hip or
<br>
heart pace maker? 
<br>
<p>All these modifications of the natural body are endured or embraced for the
<br>
*life-enhancing benefits* they provide us as human beings (evolved
<br>
conscious animals) in a world where the ordinary experiences of life tend
<br>
over time to wear down and diminish our physical and mental health.
<br>
<p>It is especially ironic that transhumanists are often accused of being
<br>
`flesh-hating' body deniers on the one hand, and attacked as narcissistic
<br>
and self-obsessed with fitness and healthy longevity on the other. (True,
<br>
some extropians fit more readily into one category or the other.)
