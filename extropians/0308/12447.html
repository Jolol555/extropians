<em>&gt; Mike, please correct me if I am wrong. From your text I infer that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority of issues that you consider really important, are those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to whether or not you can carry a gun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did not change the title because I do not want to start a new gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread, but I find difficult to understand why you and many others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a big issue of this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I had to spend time in a really dangerous place, and if no other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of protection is in place, of course I would wish to carry a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gun, perhaps even if this is not allowed by the law. But the meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I attribute to this sentence is not different from the meaning I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attribute to &quot;If I had to spend time in a place where it is raining,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if no other kind of protection is in place, of course I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish to carry a umbrella, perhaps even if this is not allowed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law&quot;. I do not consider umbrellas and guns as defining aspects of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worldview.
</em><br>
<p>Nor do I. I consider gun ownership to be a decisive litmus test of any
<br>
political jurisdiction's dedication to individual liberty and trust of
<br>
the individual. Either you trust your fellow citizen with the power of
<br>
life and death or you don't. If you do trust them, then you trust them
<br>
with all other sorts of political rights. If you don't, then you don't
<br>
really trust your fellow man, do you? All the other &quot;rights&quot; are really
<br>
priviledges that may be disallowed based on future events or
<br>
prejudices, simply because if the state is the only entity with
<br>
weapons, then it can impose whatever it wants on its serfs, er, I mean
<br>
&quot;citizens&quot;.
<br>
<p>Trust IS the defining aspect of my worldview, and that of a number of
<br>
other extropians. I trust those that trust me. I don't trust those that
<br>
don't trust me. I therefore separate the world into two types of
<br>
people, groups, and governments: those that trust me and those that do
<br>
not. Those that do not trust me are enemies, opponents, adversaries who
<br>
I am implacably against, or else ininformed, uneducated, ignorant
<br>
innocents who may become informed, educated, and aware allies of mine.
<br>
<p>As it happens, I live in a very safe place today. New Hampshire has one
<br>
of the lowest crime rates in the entire world, and the lowest in the
<br>
entire US. It also has one of the highest rates of gun ownership, if
<br>
not the highest rate in the world, and is one of the freest in allowing
<br>
its citizens to carry and use their firearms.
<br>
<p>I know that the reason NH enjoys the former situation is specifically
<br>
because it guarantees the latter situation. 
<br>
<p>ANY society has a choice to make with its laws: either impose a police
<br>
state, or allow the citizens to police themselves to some greater or
<br>
lesser degree. It has been conclusively demonstrated that the more
<br>
citizens can police themselves, via CCW laws or other mechanisms, the
<br>
lower crime rates are (not just violent crime).
<br>
<p>While there are many other nations besides the US that have lower
<br>
violent crime rates (nor is the US homogenous legally, most crime here
<br>
is in low-trust areas) such nations typically enjoy a far greater
<br>
degree of ethnic homogeneity. None of these nations, however, has a
<br>
lower property crime rate than the US. Instead, many prosecute property
<br>
owners for defending themselves and their property against criminals.
<br>
<p>European nations do not allow the populace to police itself. Weapons
<br>
ownership is banned or highly restricted, and yet there is much illegal
<br>
weapons based crime. Individuals are restricted from protecting their
<br>
property, consequently property crime is generally five times higher
<br>
than in the US.
<br>
<p>An individual person in the world today is at far greater risk of being
<br>
victimized by crime, and more likely property crime, than terrorism.
<br>
For this reason, I feel safe today, here in NH.
<br>
<p>Here in New Hampshire, both our violent AND property crime rates are
<br>
lower than any european nation. I feel very safe here.
