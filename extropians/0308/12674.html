<p><em>&gt; The Dallas Morning News, 7 August 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Guest Columnist Diane Barnet, Arlington, Texas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [COMMENT:  Frankly, it is outrageous that the same President who does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not want &quot;socialized medicine&quot; in America is planning to use American 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxpayer dollars to pay for health care for all Iraqis.  America is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only major nation in the world that does not provide some form of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national health care for its citizens.  Even lowly Cuba and North 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Korea provide national health care!  Vote For Howard Dean For 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President!  RS]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Part of President Bush's plan for rebuilding Iraq is the provision of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health care for the Iraqi population.  Meanwhile, Americans lacking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to health care now number more than 40 million.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The average American is just a layoff or divorce away from losing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health benefits.  Many workers remain in jobs they loathe in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide their families with medical coverage.  The uninsured crowd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergency rooms.  Even for the insured, co-payments, premiums and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deductibles continue to rise meteorically and unpredictably.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even try to buy individual health insurance if you have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-existing condition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet our congressmen enjoy a lifelong govenment-run health care plan 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to the Canadian system.  But mention Canada's health care, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and shrieks of &quot;socialized medicine&quot; and &quot;rationed care&quot; reverberate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Canadian-style health care has much to recommend it.  I should know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- I grew up in Canada and have worked as a registered nurse in both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries.  The beauty of the Canadian system is that no one has to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy private insurance -- all are covered, cradle to grave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In each of Canada's 10 provinces, the health department periodically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hammers out a global budget with the hospitals.  Wasteful duplication 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of services is eliminated through the establishment of centers of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellence that specialize in treating certain diseases, such as bone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doctors are reimbursed by the government on a fee-for-service basis. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That means not only that they are paid promptly, with a minimum of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paperwork, but also that no third-party insurance companies insert 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves between doctor and patient.  All Canadians over 65 get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prescriptions free.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since all 28 million Canadians have access to preventive care and are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spared the stress of worrying about how to pay for medical treatment, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are -- you guessed it -- healthier than their U.S. counterparts. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rationed care?  No more than our HMOs and lack of coverage limit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care, and Canadians can choose their own doctors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans aren't well served by the present &quot;system&quot; of health care 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delivery.  Hardly a system, it is a crazy quilt of competing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities, including insurers, hospitals and other &quot;providers&quot;.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the operative word is &quot;competing&quot;, since earning profits for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shareholders is the bottom line.  Health care has become just another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commodity that is bought and sold.  It has become a privilege for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who can afford it, not a basic human right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe Americans would be better off seeking medical care in Iraq if a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehensive system is to be established there.  But I suggest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking a look at Canada first, especially when it is time to vote.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p><p><p>Great post! I cannot imagine a more extropian goal than the citizens of a 
<br>
particular country providing universal healthcare for themselves by 
<br>
leveraging their collective tax payments, their ability to control and 
<br>
regulate commerce within the borders of the country, and their collective 
<br>
market size in a way that maximizes their own good, and not that of profit. 
<br>
<p>The Iraqi situation is a really good illustration, too.
