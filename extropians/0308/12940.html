<em>&gt;&gt; 	h)  We need to enforce free-marketeer values FROM THE TOP DOWN and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; BOTTOM UP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (I know, sounds vague and slogan-y.  Here's the what I mean:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I wasn't really able to understand your proposal here.
</em><br>
<p>You'd have to care to read it.
<br>
<p>Basically - remove restrictions on currency and travel for individuals 
<br>
FIRST.  This would be by lifting immigration laws, removing currency 
<br>
restrictions, privatizing basic social services, eliminating 
<br>
opportunities for oligarchy generally.   Then, hold members of 
<br>
corporations personally responsible for the actions of the 
<br>
corporations.  There are too many specifics to list quickly.  Maybe I 
<br>
should draft some legislation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 3)  Rafal's question is a valid one, &quot;Should he be prevented from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; making an arbitrary exchange with consenting persons?&quot;  The answer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yes - if you are exchanging human lives (perhaps any of the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which results from human lives), you should be prevented from making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ARBITRARY exchanges of that kind.  You should be prevented by those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; morally responsible for that person's being - themselves, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; friends and family, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You seem to be using a taboo to reject a class of tradeoffs. You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to read Tetlock's article we discussed in the &quot;Taboos&quot; thread 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In effect you are arrogating to yourself the right to judge others, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bend their will to your ideas of what is good for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not nice, IMO.
</em><br>
<p>What I said was:
<br>
<p>&quot;In any case, it should be the other way around - the political forces 
<br>
which exist to enable you to make such exchanges should be removed.  In 
<br>
today's world this means removing border and economic restrictions on 
<br>
individuals and political organizations FIRST while enforcing those 
<br>
rules on corporations.&quot;
<br>
<p>Read better and snip better.  The ANTI-Competetive forces that would 
<br>
allow you to trade in human effort need to be removed, enabling the 
<br>
human &quot;being traded&quot; to bargain fairly for the value of their labor.  
<br>
These include the Limited Liability Corporation (in its various forms 
<br>
including the standard American C-Corp and S-Corp) as well as various 
<br>
legal restrictions on personal behavior (for instance the freedom of 
<br>
travel and the freedom of exchange - including the freedom to use 
<br>
alternate currencies such as Gold).
<br>
<p>An aside - it's a typical and rather annoying practice called SELECTIVE 
<br>
SNIPPING.  No point in continuing if you're going to continue to not 
<br>
read what I've written.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 4)  Dialectical Ad Hominem for Rafal:  On Nike's slavery commitments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 20 seconds on google will get you all the information you need.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You've been informed, the responsibility is now yours.  (first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reference: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cslnews/">http://www.geocities.com/cslnews/</a> ).  It did, after all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; make it to the supreme court.  WHY do you think that major US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; corporations ship their labor oversees if not to take advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cheaper labor?  Do you think that labor doesn't become inhumanely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cheap so as to be morally equivalent with slavery?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Well, yes, this exactly what I deny - slavery is slavery, cheap 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap labor. Nike is not a slave driver.
</em><br>
<p>Fine, it's BAD to use INHUMANELY CHEAP LABOR.  Are we now in agreement 
<br>
or is there something more to your position along the lines of &quot;It's 
<br>
okay WHATEVER NIKE might be doing&quot;?
<br>
<p>In what sense is &quot;Slavery&quot; not MORALLY equivalent with FORCING people 
<br>
to work for $.01/day?
<br>
I didn't say they were the same thing, just that they were morally 
<br>
equivalent.  &quot;Salva veritae&quot; in moral distinctions.
<br>
If someone should be punished for enslaving someone else, they should 
<br>
be punished for forcing them to work in self-perpetuating sub-poverty 
<br>
conditions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Slavery is  vague word like other words &quot;fraud&quot; or &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;bald&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>SNIP
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; BUT if you think that obfuscating this issue into an issue about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; meaning of words is going to CONVINCE THIS AUDIENCE, I sincerely hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you're fooling yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### The following characteristics are true of slavery as defined by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictionary:
</em><br>
<p>SNIP
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Their labor or services are obtained through force;
</em><br>
<p>SNIP
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, if you want to make this a game of words, the only one you 
<br>
fool is yourself.  From now on you can exchange &quot;Effective Slavery&quot; for 
<br>
&quot;Slavery&quot; IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I would like to point out to you that, as is obvious to anybody 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read my posts, I do not consider the condition of having to labor for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 cent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a day to be, as you wrote &quot;GOOD&quot;. I stated (and you jeeringly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commented on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it) &quot;Poverty is wrong&quot;. Please do not try to demonize me be ascribing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hatred and contempt for humanity.
</em><br>
<p>My mistake, so you're in agreement that any humane (and Extropic) 
<br>
political program should include as a primary goal the lifting of the 
<br>
political conditions that contribute to chronic poverty and that 
<br>
Oligarchies, disenfranchisement, state oppression and unfair business 
<br>
practices are among the main causes thereof?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The adequate words to describe the plight of those who are paid little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global companies for their labor in e.g. Burma, are &quot;poverty&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;disenfranchisement&quot;, &quot;state oppression&quot;, and &quot;oligarchy&quot;. More global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment is the best cure for these ailments.
</em><br>
<p>Not sure what you mean by &quot;Global Investment&quot; but I'd suggest an 
<br>
alternative for global investment as it is actually practiced today is 
<br>
the political elimination of the anti-competitive nature of oligarchies 
<br>
SUCH AS the policies of the United States, China, Burma and just about 
<br>
every-other state.  Otherwise your global investment is likely just to 
<br>
end up in the hands of the wealthy - as it always has.
<br>
<p>The a priori argument is simple - if Nike is allowed to continue its 
<br>
current &quot;Global Investment&quot; strategy, it will use its economic power to 
<br>
perpetuate its power and in particular will invest in situations that 
<br>
will tend to keep labor cheap and profits high.  This will include 
<br>
sponsoring &quot;sub-humane&quot; labor conditions in third-world nations.  If 
<br>
they can find some military fiend to assist them in Burma, so much the 
<br>
better.  Similarly, the banks that own Nike will continue lending 
<br>
practices which empower those nation-states which enforce sub-humane 
<br>
labor to continue that practice as long as possible and will seek to 
<br>
create new slave-states wherever possible and profitable.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if we were to call the owners of Nike to account 
<br>
PERSONALLY for the actions of the corporation, for instance, by making 
<br>
it illegal to be an owner of a company that utilizes child-labor or 
<br>
forced labor or sub-poverty labor, then we'd have something worth 
<br>
talking about.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie Lindauer
