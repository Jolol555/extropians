Barbara,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might look at Agri-Forestry and Sustainable Farming.  Some 
<br>
scientists make much of agriculture having progressed by moving from one level of 
<br>
expertise to another.  One example is how my Indian ancestors had both the wild 
<br>
apple and the wild grape available for domestication but never did anything 
<br>
with either.  The agricultural scientists say the American Indians had not 
<br>
achieved the level of expertise required to handle moving up to the level that 
<br>
growing apples and grapes requires.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it appears that Agri-Forestry and Sustainable Farming are the 
<br>
next level to be achieved.
<br>
Ron h.
