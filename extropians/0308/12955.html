The story of this woman is a valid one, and Amnesty International is a
<br>
reputable organization. In their privacy statement they inform users that
<br>
they will not redistribute the information you provide except for the cause
<br>
in which you are providing it. Disclosure issues are elaborated here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.amnesty.org.au/privacy.html">http://www.amnesty.org.au/privacy.html</a> and would only be done if they were
<br>
required to do so by law (criminal or court reasons). There are no hidden
<br>
cookies used either, accept for their Australian site, which is non
<br>
identifiable. This is such an important cause, and since you will just be
<br>
forwarding an email to others that will provide a link to the form that
<br>
requests their email address, there is no apparent spam threat. I commend
<br>
your concern and have filled out the petition.

<p><p><p><em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I received the following request to sign a petition aimed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing the stoning of a Nigerian woman for adultery.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently a similar petition has been successful before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have signed it but I am not going to forward it as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requests to people in my address book because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know that to do so would not be exposing them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an email spamming scam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's the quandry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) This seems like a very worth while petition to sign if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something so easy to do can have such a positive outcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the technique could be used elesewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (2) Can someone with the tech knowledge please advise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the safety of forwarding it? It asks for an email address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the point of signing. Possibly that is the real danger point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where people would be exposing themselves to spammers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when trying to do something humane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its annoying, but it seems to me that it would be easy for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scammers (who'd be spammers) to use just such a tool.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;Hearing on AMINA LAWAL SET TO BE STONED ON
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - 27 AUGUST 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;  The Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;sentence for Amina Lawal, condemned for the crime of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;adultery on August 19th 2002, to be buried up to her
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;neck and stoned to death. Her death was postponed so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;that she could continue to nurse her baby. Hearing on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;her Execution is now set for 27 AUGUST 2003.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;If you haven't been following this case, you might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;like to know that Amina's baby is regarded as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;'evidence' of her adultery.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Amina's case is being handled by the Spanish branch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Amnesty International, which is attempting to put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;together enough signatures to make the Nigerian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;government rescind the death sentence. A similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;campaign saved another Nigerian woman, Safiya,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;condemned in similar circumstances. By March 4th the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;petition had amassed over 2,600,000 signatures. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;will only take you a few seconds to sign Amnesty's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;online petition. Please sign the petition now, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;copy this message into a new email and send it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;everyone in your address book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Go to the web page

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Thanks for reading this. Please take the time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;sign the petition...
