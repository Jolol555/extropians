<p>
I used the word &quot;extropians&quot; in a serious discussion recently and once again
<br>
was reminded that extropians sound like goofy cultists.
<br>
Not being able to find out why they were thinking that, or have them forward
<br>
me a link where one serious extropian sound like they say, I had to imagine
<br>
the problem they might have that makes their opinion. So here it is,
<br>
formulated as a question accordingly to the 7th extropian principle wich
<br>
invites constructive criticism :
<br>
<p>What would be the best answer to someone who would say that the primo body
<br>
and mind uploading  are allegoric figures that transhumanists and extropians
<br>
are offering that permits to fantasm a body removed from it's attaches with
<br>
the present, the here and now, impossible bodies, wich makes them promoter
<br>
of an ascetic ideal, who hates the body and the flesh (and are possibly even
<br>
worse than christians at it,  with their angels without  nose or phallus)
<br>
and consequently alienation (alienation is to be understood here as &quot;being
<br>
estranged to oneself&quot;).
<br>
<p>I have a working answer but I would like to hear what others think about
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>Thank you in advance
