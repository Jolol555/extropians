<p><em>&gt;Other than those that bear DIRECTLY on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist agenda, this isn't one of them...
</em><br>
<p><p>I am waaay with Greg on this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... then why are the authors listed at the Extropy Shop - those that
</em><br>
may not have a &gt;DIRECT bearing on the transhumanist agenda per se - have
<br>
a right-wing/libertarian &gt;bent?...
<br>
<p><p>They do?  I thought that wonderful aspect of Extropians
<br>
had become nearly extinct, or at least very suppressed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;...I say, what we need here is more levity...
</em><br>
<p><p>Wooohooooo!  Im with ya there Olga.  We really
<br>
need to lighten up if we are hoping to live for
<br>
a bunch of decades or centuries.  I propose the
<br>
return of the smilies to the extropians list,
<br>
lots of em:  {8-]  {8-]  Come on, don't worry,
<br>
be happy.  Life's more fun that way.  Lets get
<br>
back to that dynamic optimism, let our mascot
<br>
be Tigger.
<br>
<p><p>... Dave Barry once wrote ...
<br>
<p><p>Dave Barry is such a kick.  Very insightful
<br>
quote Olga.  I wonder what his sendup of 
<br>
libertarians would be?  {8-]  spike
