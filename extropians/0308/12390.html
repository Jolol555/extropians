On Sun Aug 03, 2003 01:25 pm Lee Corbin argued:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that it's extremely important for us to question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inevitability of senescence and death.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. My poetical image of 'sitting in a rocking chair on the porch' 
<br>
was not intended to be taken too literally or to imply senescence.
<br>
Older people who do not have to worry about income (because they have a 
<br>
good pension or are wealthy) and already have much experience of the 
<br>
world are not as 'driven' as the young turks. Some are old crocks, but 
<br>
many play golf, tour the world, take drugs (prescribed - of course!), 
<br>
etc. Age, experience and relative wealth does change your outlook on life.
<br>
<p>The European nations are just beginning to grapple with the problems of 
<br>
an aging population, because the young folk don't want kids anymore. If 
<br>
they do have children, they only have one, which is not enough to stop 
<br>
the aging population problem.
<br>
<p>Now, Lee claims that when our science makes us relatively immortal, we 
<br>
will still want to produce loads of offspring. I think that all the 
<br>
evidence so far points in the opposite direction. Give people a good 
<br>
standard of living, a bit of education and only ten extra years and they 
<br>
already stop having children.
<br>
<p>The only way round this is to assume that as well as immortality, we 
<br>
also get unlimited resources, so we can support lots of offspring.
<br>
But, Will we want to? is the big question.
<br>
<p>A recent analysis of the lives of famous scientists claimed that after 
<br>
they got married and had kids, their contribution to research was 
<br>
finished. You may not like the idea at present, but I am pretty sure 
<br>
that when you are immortal and independently wealthy, you won't want to 
<br>
work 9 to 5 hunched over a computer in a cubicle, or heating exotic 
<br>
substances in a test tube.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, I *will* want to continue to delight in understanding,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, were I only able to muster the intelligence, the knowledge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the energy, then I also *would* be among those doing research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and exploring the galaxies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, why not? What is physically impossible about *me* having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlimited energy? It's just a matter of the application of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, and the sun at present supplies vastly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy than would be required. All I need to do is live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long enough, and somehow survive this century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, I don't disagree. I'll let you have all these things. :)
<br>
But when you've got them, you won't be the old Lee with a few 
<br>
superpowers. You will be a completely different being who will laugh at 
<br>
the pre-singularity ambitions of the old Lee.
<br>
<p>There probably will be a tiny window of time when we are in the process 
<br>
of changing, when many different and dangerous things will be going on. 
<br>
But assuming we survive, we will come out the other end as very 
<br>
different beings.
<br>
<p>I do not see it as a defeatist philosophy that a wise, immortal being 
<br>
sees no need to conquer galaxies. When the nano world is available to us 
<br>
a molecule floating in space could be a universe for each of us.
<br>
