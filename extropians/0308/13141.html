<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;...Jeff Davis, as I have all ready elaborated, said the 'good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;guys' won in Vietnam...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Michael, make sure you understood what (I think) Jeff was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting at.  The west contained communism long enough for it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to collapse under its own weight.  In that sense, the good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guys did win in Vietnam, setting the stage for the eventual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;victory of WW3, which petered out around 1990.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Spike, I appreciate your comments, buts Jeff's statements were pretty
<br>
clear.  From an older post (I havent the time to dig out the specific
<br>
post reference)
<br>
<p>1st, Jeff elaborates on what he feels is the correct interpreation of
<br>
the Vietnamese government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The truth? Three million deaths caused by the French,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Americans, and their respective puppets.  No &quot;enslavement&quot; by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communists, just a different form of government facing the difficult 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; task of rebuilding a country savaged by 124 years of foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictatorships, and made all the more difficult by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition of the political elite of the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; richest and most powerful country.  An elite filled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with hostility by their defeat at the hands of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people with the brains, discipline, and courage to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the enormous price required to &quot;refuse&quot; the tyranny of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign dictators.
</em><br>
<p>AND
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All governments have laws for the maintenance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social order.  Freedom of speech has its limitations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I may not cry &quot;fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocate the violent overthrow of the US government. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communists (and their subsequent governments), under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; siege by the capitalists from before the ink was dry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, feel the need to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves from foreign subversion--
</em><br>
<p>And for Jeff's specific comments
<br>
<p>For Jeff's actual statement -
<br>
<a href="http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::Y0NjMwdx-YHAW-Whs2-BiF7-Kk">http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::Y0NjMwdx-YHAW-Whs2-BiF7-Kk</a>

BxYCN5VzJY speaking in reference to the winners of the vietnam war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Hell!, my side--the right side--prevailed--though at horrific
<br>
cost--back when it was the central event of my generation.  Hooray!
<br>
Having taken my victory lap, it is now time for me to get on with
<br>
looking to the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>And as for the Iraq Kuwait comment
<br>
<p>Paul Grant commented:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm a bit busy prepping for a trip but I couldn't wait to answer this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; section :P
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Uh, just in case you didn't know, Kuwait was originally part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Like Sudan was part of Egypt.  In point of fact, Iraq refused to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; recognize Kuwait as an independent country until 2 years *AFTER*
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; gulf war. So as far as I'm concerned, Saddam didn't invade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------
<br>
<p>On that note, I shall be out of town for a few days and unavailable for
<br>
response.
