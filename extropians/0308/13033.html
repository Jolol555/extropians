THE LATEST BOGUS FOSSIL-NUKE BLACKOUT:  THIS GRID SHOULD NOT EXIST 
<br>
<p>By Harvey Wasserman 
<br>
<p>&lt; <a href="http://www.freepress.org">http://www.freepress.org</a> &gt;
<br>
<p><p>This is the fourth---and worst---completely unnecessary major blackout of the
<br>
Northeast in forty years, dating back to 1965. 
<br>
<p>It's scope---from Detroit to Ottawa to New York and New Jersey---is absolutely
<br>
awesome, especially since it's due to total stupidity and corruption. 
<br>
<p>This does not count the blackouts that raged through California in 2000-2001. 
<br>
Those were &quot;blackmails,&quot; set by Enron and the other Bush gas cronies to rip $60
<br>
billion out of the state, leading to, among other things, the impending ouster
<br>
of Gov. Gray Davis. 
<br>
<p>When the lights went out, Davis kissed the feet of Southern California Edison's
<br>
John Bryson, who engineered a deregulation bill that gouged $30 billion out of
<br>
the ratepayers for the state's failed nukes.  That opened the gates for the gas
<br>
pirates to steal yet another $60 billion.  Davis got caught in the backdraft. 
<br>
<p>The culprits in this latest northeastern disaster are basically the same---the
<br>
barons of fossil and nuclear power and their cronies in the electric utility
<br>
business. 
<br>
<p>Their &quot;weapon&quot; is an ancient electric grid that's obsolete if not obscene. It is
<br>
a massively fragile Rube Goldberg device that dangerously and inefficiently
<br>
carts around electricity from expensive, polluting and extremely unsafe central
<br>
generating plants to buildings that waste massive amounts of energy and generate
<br>
none. 
<br>
<p>That the grid will crash again and again and yet again is absolutely certain. 
<br>
The only question is who are the real terrorists:  errant crazies who blow
<br>
things up, or entrenched interests that refuse to change? 
<br>
<p>The technology now exists to transcend this mess.  In the mid 1990s California's
<br>
green energy advocates proposed a 600-megawatt mosaic of solar, wind and other
<br>
renewable generators that would have entirely prevented the fake deregulatory
<br>
crisis of 2000-1.  It was approved by the California Public Utilities
<br>
Commission, but then killed by Southern California Edison and the Federal Energy
<br>
Regulatory Commission. 
<br>
<p>Today, the Bush Administration wants to further subsidize its fossil/utility
<br>
friends with a bad energy bill, and by pouring billions into &quot;upgrading&quot; the
<br>
electric grid.  The only thing certain is that every cent of that money will be
<br>
wasted. 
<br>
<p>In 1952 a Blue Ribbon report to Harry Truman predicted that the future of
<br>
America's energy rested with the sun.  It predicted 13 million solar-powered
<br>
homes here by 1975, and the promise of decentralized, off-grid self-sufficiency.
<br>
. 
<br>
<p>Instead, Dwight Eisenhower took us into the pit of the &quot;Peaceful Atom&quot;.  A
<br>
trillion dollars later, we have a half-century of crashing grids and dangerous
<br>
nukes that are vulnerable to terrorism and must shut down precisely when they're
<br>
most needed, as they did during this latest blackout.  The latest Bush energy
<br>
bill only makes the situation worse, with more nuke subsidies and a powerful
<br>
push for fossil fuels, especially coal. 
<br>
<p>The whole system demands a green deconstruction.  Solar technologies are ready
<br>
to make energy self-sufficiency a tangible reality.  Photovoltaic cells on
<br>
rooftops and embedded in windows can produce grid-free electricity, with battery
<br>
or fuel-cell backups. Geothermal power can heat and cool with nothing but the
<br>
power of the earth's crust. Methane digestion can turn waste into usable gas. 
<br>
Basement generators can use biomass fuels like ethanol and soy diesel for
<br>
off-grid self-sufficiency. 
<br>
<p>These systems need not provide 100% of a building's energy, but can gradually
<br>
make them increasingly self-sufficient.  Meanwhile more efficient heating,
<br>
lighting and cooling systems can reduce demand.  Windows that actually open and
<br>
close can balance usage, building by building. 
<br>
<p>Bush's &quot;upgrading the grid&quot; means a new money pit for the same old unsafe nukes,
<br>
polluting coal burners and gas turbines whose prices are set to skyrocketŠ all
<br>
looped together by dangerous, wasteful wires that are bound to crash again and
<br>
again. 
<br>
<p>San Francisco has used part of a public bond to put the first of a new
<br>
generation of solar cells atop its downtown Moscone Center.  Those same cells
<br>
could've kept Madison Square Garden or any other Manhattan building up and
<br>
running during this latest outage. Will New Yorkers know better next time? 
<br>
<p>The technology for a decentralized, solar-based power system is ready now. We
<br>
don't need massive research breakthroughs. 
<br>
<p>We need public demand and fully funded production capacity.  And to stop
<br>
repeating the same mistakes because the utility and fossil/nuke guys fund the
<br>
politicians in power. 
<br>
<p>This isn't rocket science.  It's just common solar sense, known to all since
<br>
1952.
