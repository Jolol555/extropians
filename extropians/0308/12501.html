<p>While I agree with all of those things I doubt I would say most of them the

fear, condolences and so on):
<br>
<p>&quot;Lets find who was responsible and bring them to justice.  But we should not

lose our own freedoms in the process or pick entire countries to war with

<em>&gt; &gt; That was not my conclusion. My conclusion was that the very REAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threats and risks of terrorism (and the damage it does, counting in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thousands of lives and many hundreds of billions of dollars) are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better insurance for the ruling parties to retain leadership than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Soviet Union ever was. Who wants to risk voting in some unknown freaky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; third party candidate when we have a 'war' to run?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So there is a vested interest in maintaining the sort of conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that give rise to anti-US organizations of militant or non-militant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you are implying that the Bush administration (and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administrations) have an incentive to make progress in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war against terrorism---so that they'll be re-elected---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not *too* much progress, or else the &quot;ruling leadership&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be able to retain power?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Dunno if he was implying that but I believe that is certainly true.  It is a 
<br>
historical fact that the use of terrorism on American soil to promote 
<br>
policies of the day has been considered during at least some administrations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what if a chance to pass up capturing Osama Bin Laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventuated in a traceable terrorist attack the A-bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Philadelphia?  Unless the &quot;ruling leadership&quot; was absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain that their easing up on terrorists was untraceable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then they'd be taking a terrible risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If someone gets to close to the truth then their career is ruined and the 
<br>
evidence is ruled critical to &quot;national security&quot; and never sees enough 
<br>
daylight to bring the guilty to justice.   The machinery to protect those in 
<br>
power is in place and well maintained. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, now I recall.  President Clinton *did* pass up a chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get Osama, and no one is complaining too much.  But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would happen if a Republican were to miss a chance to corral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a well known terrorist?  If it were at all traceable, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell would break loose!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are you kidding?  Clinton was grilled publicly for years over a sexual 
<br>
indiscretion.  Bush and company shut down investigations, refuse 
<br>
Congressional subpoenas,  lie to the people to justify a war,  rewrite or 
<br>
throw out treaties, eviscerate FOIA, ask for and receive powers to gut 
<br>
whatever freedoms they want including revoking citizenship and the sheeple 
<br>
say almost nothing at all.   Now which side is benefitting from a double 
<br>
standard?
