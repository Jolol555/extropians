<em>&gt; Hmm, is it just my swedishness, or are the tone of these letters a bit

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially in the US I have the distinct feeling that suggesting that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe the core issue should be stated more calmly: yes, this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice some people see as pseudoscience or yukky, but almost any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice, be it cremation, the use of antibiotics for appendicitis or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acupuncture is viewed as pseudoscience or yukky by *someone* (or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people). That still does not mean it should be hindered unless it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually hurts somebody. A society which cannot tolerate diversity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unusual ideas is going to end up impoverished and intolerant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder if one could get some of Richard Florida's ideas about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the creative class moves in here. Essentially, if a place like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michigan shows that it does not tolerate the unusual (by banning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics and tounge splitting) it sends a signal to many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultural creatives that increasingly form the core of economic growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this is not the place to be. It does not matter that most never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would even consider getting a suspension or split tounge, they know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that their own particular interests or views might be circumscribed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that the area is less likely to attract other interesting people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - so they go elsewhere. Is that a desired signal?
</em><br>
<p>### I fully agree with the above (maybe it's my Polishness). There is no
<br>
need to antagonize an official who may not be totally an enemy, and even if
<br>
he is, sounding too strident is in bad taste. By all means, those who wish
<br>
to contact Hollister on CI's behalf should try for a reasoned if firm tone,
<br>
along exactly the lines of Ander's thinking.
