Rafal contributes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On page 42 of the article (&quot; Tetlock, P.E., Kristel, O., Elson, B., Green,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M., and Lerner, J (final revision process/2000). The psychology of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unthinkable: Taboo trade-offs, forbidden base rates, and heretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterfactuals. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&quot;), I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found the following:
</em><br>
<p>So this is not on-line anywhere?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &quot;Greenberg et al.'s (1994) terror-management theory posits that people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are reminded of their mortality seek out the existential comfort of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectively shared world view that transcends their mortal life spans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endows their lives with moral significance.  Linking this alternative theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people as intuitive theologians to the SVPM leads to the hypothesis that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agnostic Bayesian libertarians excepted, people reminded of their mortality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be especially outraged by taboo trade-offs,
</em><br>
<p>Is anyone willing to elaborate on what might be meant by
<br>
&quot;taboo trade-offs&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; forbidden base rates,
</em><br>
<p>What do you think this is?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and heretical counterfactuals that de-stabilize their worldview,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and especially inclined to moral cleansing&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I guess that moral cleansing includes any effort to make a
<br>
group's views more uniform by exerting pressure on the
<br>
iconoclasts.  (By &quot;pressure&quot; I mean anything in excess of
<br>
rational criticism, including dismissals as &quot;uninformed&quot;,
<br>
&quot;illogical&quot;, etc., even when we believe those to be true.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### I am an agnostic Bayesian libertarian, and Tetlock's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; findings are an incredibly powerful synthesis of what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means to be me,
</em><br>
<p>I.e., if we copy an object and the copy turns out not to have
<br>
these traits, it is not Rafal
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as opposed to non-agnostic, non-Bayesian non-libertarians.
</em><br>
<p>Or perhaps any one of the three!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Explains among others why I reacted to intimations of my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mortality by signing a cryonics contract,
</em><br>
<p>sounds more prudent than suddenly espousing collective yearnings
<br>
for humankind or embracing theology
<br>
<p><em>&gt; how my long process of psychological self-modification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could lead to the almost complete removal of the three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fiskean schemata from my mind,
</em><br>
<p>What are these, and how does one tell if he's been successful
<br>
at their removal?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and how these internally inconsistent elements could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supplanted by a unified, volition-based ethical construct.
</em><br>
<p>Well, one does wish for consistency inside one's value system.
<br>
I sort of hope that you are not saying more than that here.
<br>
<p>Lee
