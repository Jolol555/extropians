<p><em>&gt; Ah, yes, but as I've pointed out many many times, we

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Lee, this is a fundamental flaw in the consideration of the
<br>
behavior of advanced civilizations -- particularly if they
<br>
are &quot;tightly integrated&quot; as an &quot;uploaded&quot; civilization might
<br>
be.  The problems are that (a) you have access to the entire
<br>
knowledge base of the civilization at vary high bandwidth
<br>
(so this is a &quot;wealth&quot; of knowledge).; and (b) it looks like
<br>
a solar system can contain something like 2^50 bits of
<br>
information -- this can get even more complex if one &quot;overloads&quot;
<br>
terms.
<br>
<p>I have yet to see anyone propose a reasonable scheme for
<br>
sending 2^50 bits across interstellar distances.  I just
<br>
don't think it is going to be easy -- and if it is &quot;easy&quot;
<br>
it seems likely that it is going to be expensive (in terms
<br>
of energy, mass, etc.)
<br>
<p>Copying a megabyte of information between floppies is cheap
<br>
to us now.  But copying a civilization's entire information
<br>
base seems problematic.  So it seems likely that if one does
<br>
it one may do it rarely when the cost is lowest.  If instead
<br>
one decides to &quot;go it alone&quot; one is sacrificing a huge knowledge
<br>
base.  I don't think people of our culture can easily understand
<br>
what that means (it is probably much worse than the situation
<br>
experienced by colonizers of a few centuries ago).  Look at how
<br>
&quot;emplaced&quot; Google has become and multiply the sacrifice of that
<br>
by many orders of magnitude.  It could be argued that colonization
<br>
would in effect require the loss of ones &quot;identity&quot;.
<br>
<p>Thought question: &quot;How much of yourself (mental, physical, etc.)
<br>
would you sacrifice colonize a new star system?&quot;.
<br>
<p>And before you answer, read a little bit about the misadventures
<br>
of the Donner Party.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Really, though, I sincerely wonder what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does keep everyone in the U.S. from moving to California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reasons that people need all that ice and snow aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear to me, but the reasons do exist.)
</em><br>
<p>Some of us actually *left* California, in large part due
<br>
to the hazard function presented by earthquakes.
<br>
<p>And besides you can't do ice-fishing in CA (generally
<br>
speaking)...  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Advanced civilizations will simply *spread* outward,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if the papers you are studying make it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantageous to run outside galaxies, then eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despite the fewer resources, the matter dominated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas inside galaxies would very gradually fall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, being in a galaxy puts you in the &quot;stupid&quot; part of
<br>
the universe.  (But hey, you didn't know before now
<br>
so you can't really be faulted for it...).
<br>
<p>But it doesn't matter.  Alligators cannot live where
<br>
lions live and lions cannot live where alligators live.
<br>
We live in the hazardous (stupid) part of the universe
<br>
and those more advanced than us live elsewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is, all tentacles of civilization that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach beyond a galaxy will by definition lag 20,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years behind to begin with.  It will take a *long time*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to catch up and surpass their parents.
</em><br>
<p>Granted -- but MBrains and other civilizations most likely
<br>
*have* a &quot;long time&quot;.  A sol-type star, properly star-lifted,
<br>
has a lifetime of trillion(s) of years, or one could always migrate
<br>
to a sufficiently small star with a similar lifetime.  So one has a
<br>
&quot;long time&quot; significantly exceeding how long the universe has existed
<br>
thus far (perhaps 100+ times longer).  That is a *long* time
<br>
to figure out &quot;Plan B&quot;.
