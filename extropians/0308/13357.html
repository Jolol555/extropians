<p>
I have an engine which I add to a normal bike. See it here...
<br>
<a href="http://www.zapworld.com/dx.htm">http://www.zapworld.com/dx.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I bought it a few years back. It's required no maintenance, and I've moved
<br>
it across about 5 different bikes now I think.
<br>
<p>It's range is not too bad under ideal conditions; one lead-acid battery
<br>
(From website... BATTERY: Sealed, maintenance-free, lead acid dry-cell
<br>
twelve volt, 20 amp-hr battery is approximately 7&quot; x 7&quot; x 3&quot; and weighs
<br>
about 12.5 pounds) will keep me going for about half an hour of riding. If
<br>
there are some hills, it'll be juiced more quickly. In a very hilly,
<br>
bike-unfriendly region, it's hopeless (so I couldn't use it when I lived in
<br>
the adelaide hills).
<br>
<p>In the wet, it's range can just about halve, because of poor traction
<br>
between the spindle and the tyre (you have to clamp it down tighter, which
<br>
increases friction I think). I've been experiencing that a lot lately, but I
<br>
think with some adjustment of the placement of the engine I can fix it
<br>
somewhat.
<br>
<p>As to speed, check the URL above. All I know is, it'll accelerate me very
<br>
quickly (with a bit of pedalling added in), and get me to a speed I'd get to
<br>
by pedalling pretty hard at fairly high gearing; quite fast. Also note it is
<br>
addive, so your pedalling adds to it, which is excellent. You can work at a
<br>
fairly lasy rate, putting in a little effort, and pass the spandex clad
<br>
cycle nazis, which is funny. It's almost silent and pretty unobtrusive, so
<br>
people don't notice it until you show it to them. 
<br>
<p>A couple of years ago, I used to ride an hour to work, and took a second
<br>
battery with me (using both up on the trip). Those things are heavy! Now my
<br>
trip is twenty minutes to half an hour, so it's just perfect.
<br>
<p>The best thing about it is that it's not technically a motor vehicle, so
<br>
I've got no registration costs, insurance, or much in the way of regulations
<br>
besides having to wear a helmet. I can use bike paths (which are through
<br>
very pretty parkland) instead of congested roads.
<br>
<p>I have a &quot;third wheel&quot; (a long bar which joins to the seat pole and has
<br>
another seat, set of pedals, and back wheel, turns you into an articulated
<br>
tandem) which I use to take my three year old to child care, all of which is
<br>
heavy (third wheel + boy who doesn't pedal), but the engine sorts that out.
<br>
<p>I think some of the purpose built electric bikes might be more efficient
<br>
than the engine kits like mine; I test drove one a few years back that
<br>
looked like a vesper with pedals. My only problem with those is that I think
<br>
they are perceived more as a motor vehicle than a bicycle (and then you may
<br>
as well get a motorbike).
<br>
<p>But I just noticed what I *really* want for my bike; a VTOL kit from
<br>
Moller...

<em>&gt; &gt; It's the minimalist/leanest solution to the motorized

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Electric bikes seem to be getting rather popular.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In 1998, worldwide sales of electric bicycles exceeded $200 million,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making it the most viable of all consumer EV markets, as well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fastest growing transportation markets today. Market analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that the demand has grown to more than 100,000 units 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annually.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Google on 'electric bicycle' and you get lots of places you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can buy them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Alternative Fuels Data Center has a page on them:

</em><br>

<em>&gt; The US Department of Energy has a comparative table with all the data

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would expect them, like electric cars, to be more popular in a warm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; climate like California or Florida.
</em><br>
