<p>
A &quot;resume&quot; for GW Bush currently circulating on the web, worth reprinting 
<br>
here, I think:
<br>
<p>I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I 
<br>
shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set an 
<br>
economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period. I 
<br>
set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock 
<br>
market. I am the first president in U.S. history to enter office with a 
<br>
criminal record. I set the the all-time record for most days on vacation in 
<br>
any one year period. After taking-off the entire month of August 2001, I then 
<br>
presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history. I attacked and 
<br>
overtook two countries, promised to rebuild them and have not yet done so. I 
<br>
am supporting development of a &quot;Tactical Bunker Buster&quot; nuke, a WMD. I am 
<br>
getting our troops killed, under the lie of WMD components, then blaming the 
<br>
lie on our British friends and the CIA, where, coincidentally, my daddy used 
<br>
to lead. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. 
<br>
president. In my first year in office over 2 million Americans lost their 
<br>
jobs and that trend continues every month, leaving us in higher than ever 
<br>
unemployment.
<br>
<p>I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I 
<br>
appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any president in 
<br>
U.S. history. I set the record for least amount of press conferences than any 
<br>
president since the advent of television. I signed more laws and executive 
<br>
orders effectively amending or ignoring the Constitution than any president 
<br>
in history. I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and 
<br>
refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed. 
<br>
I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history and refused to 
<br>
use national reserves as past presidents have done. I have cut health care 
<br>
benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active duty 
<br>
troops and their families -- in war time. I allowed non-compete oil contracts 
<br>
to go to my VP's company (where he is still employed, but on &quot;deferred 
<br>
compensation&quot;) and won't answer to anyone about it. I have set the all-time 
<br>
record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public 
<br>
venues (15 million people) shattering the record for protest against any 
<br>
person in the history of humankind. I've dissolved more international 
<br>
treaties than any president in U.S. history.
<br>
<p>I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in U.S. 
<br>
history. I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any 
<br>
administration in U.S. history. My &quot;poorest millionaire,&quot; Condoleeza Rice, 
<br>
has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I am the first president in U.S. 
<br>
history to have almost all 50 states of the Union simultaneously suffer 
<br>
massive financial crisis. I presided over the biggest corporate stock market 
<br>
fraud of any market in any country in history. I am the first president in 
<br>
U.S. history to order a pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a 
<br>
sovereign nation, and I did so against the will of the United Nations and the 
<br>
world community. I created the largest governmental department bureaucracy in 
<br>
the history of the United States.
<br>
<p>I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more 
<br>
than any president in history. I am the first president in U.S. history to 
<br>
have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission. I 
<br>
am the first president in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the 
<br>
U.S. from the Elections Monitoring Board. I removed more checks and balances, 
<br>
and have the least amount of congressional oversight, than any presidential 
<br>
administration in U.S. history. I rendered the entire United Nations 
<br>
viewpoints irrelevant. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I 
<br>
refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. &quot;prisoners of war&quot; (detainees) and 
<br>
thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first 
<br>
president in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 
<br>
2002 U.S. election).
<br>
<p>I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most 
<br>
corporate campaign donations. My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and 
<br>
one of my best friends, (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation) 
<br>
presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history. My 
<br>
political party used the Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure 
<br>
my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my 2000 election decision. I 
<br>
have spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in U.S. 
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks 
<br>
and less than a year later made the U.S. the most resented country in the 
<br>
world, possibly the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I am 
<br>
actively working on a policy of &quot;disengagement&quot; creating the most hostile of 
<br>
Israel-Palestine relations in at least 30 years. I am the first to have a 
<br>
majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world 
<br>
peace and security. I am the first president in history to have the people of 
<br>
South Korea more threatened by the U.S. than by their immediate neighbor, 
<br>
North Korea. I changed U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded 
<br>
government contracts. I set an all-time record for the number of 
<br>
administration appointees who violated U.S. law by not selling their huge 
<br>
personal investments in corporations bidding for U.S. contracts.
<br>
<p>I failed to fulfill my pledge to capture Osama Bin Laden, dead or alive. I 
<br>
failed to capture Saddam Hussein. My family is very close with the Saudi 
<br>
Royal family, and have been for years, so I kept the pages out of the report 
<br>
on 9-11 that may put the Saudi's in a bad light. I failed to capture the 
<br>
anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the U.S. 
<br>
Capitol Building. I have no leads and no credible suspects. Following the 
<br>
World Trade Center attack I have successfully prevented any PUBLIC 
<br>
investigation into the biggest security failure in the history of the United 
<br>
States. I removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any 
<br>
president in U.S. history. In a little over two years, I created the most 
<br>
divided country in decades, possibly the most divided since the Civil War. I 
<br>
entered my office with the strongest economy in U.S. history and have turned 
<br>
every single economic category downward -- all in less than two years.
<br>
<p>Records and References: I have at least one conviction for drunk driving in 
<br>
Maine. My Texas driving record has been erased and is not available. I was 
<br>
AWOL from the National Guard. I refuse to take a drug test or even answer any 
<br>
questions about drug use. All records of my tenure as Governor of Texas are 
<br>
now in my father's library, sealed, and unavailable for public view. All 
<br>
records of SEC investigations into insider trading or bankrupt companies are 
<br>
sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes 
<br>
from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public energy 
<br>
policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.
<br>
<p>(Apologies to the original author...couldn't find any accreditation for the 
<br>
above piece.)
