This seems Extropic...
<br>
<p>MIT Everywhere
<br>
Wired Magazine, Issue 11.09 (September 2003)
<br>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/mit_pr.html">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/mit_pr.html</a>
<br>
<p>I do highly value the &quot;standard&quot; educational process
<br>
(I've had a few professors that won Nobel prizes -- and
<br>
some that didn't (no nobel prizes for &quot;history&quot;) who were
<br>
still outstanding).  But I believe that at $41,000/yr
<br>
(is that what MIT really costs now???) quality education
<br>
may be &quot;overvalued&quot;.  Given the number of hits they are
<br>
getting it sounds like they could charge a lot less to a
<br>
lot more people and get a higher income.
<br>
<p>Raises some interesting questions as to whether or not
<br>
the entire &quot;university&quot; system is now, or is about to be,
<br>
&quot;broken&quot;?  I'd much rather do distance learning (if the
<br>
technology supports it) from the best 500 teachers in the
<br>
world than attend lots of classes from mostly so-so professors
<br>
or teachers.
<br>
<p>Then of course one gets into the question of whether the
<br>
way to decrease educational costs (and indirectly taxes)
<br>
is to make all public school systems use distributed learning.
<br>
If a teacher can teach 10,000 instead of only 30, why not
<br>
allow them to do so?  (Of course some adjustment would be
<br>
required for &quot;support/question&quot; activities, but MIT seems
<br>
to have resolved some of that.)
<br>
<p>Robert
