<em>&gt; Is this a definitional claim or an empirical claim. When the American's

</em><br>
<p>I think it is a little more subtle than this and depends on ones
<br>
definition of &quot;innovation&quot;.  Does building a &quot;bigger&quot; rocket
<br>
require &quot;innovation&quot;?  Does building a more &quot;reliable&quot; rocket
<br>
require &quot;innovation&quot;?  Does designing a space suit require
<br>
&quot;innovation&quot;?  I would tend to lean in the direction that the
<br>
application of principles one already knows should not be
<br>
considered &quot;innovation&quot;.  It simply requires the application
<br>
of sufficient resources to apply what one already knows.
<br>
The creation of something &quot;new&quot; would be classified as &quot;invention&quot;
<br>
The creation of something that one knows &quot;in theory&quot; but not
<br>
&quot;in practice&quot; should probably be &quot;innovation&quot;.  Examples I might
<br>
consider would be the development of the laser, the formation
<br>
of a Bose-Einstein condensate, or the production of really
<br>
long buckytubes.
<br>
<p>I suspect there is a range from the application of known principles to
<br>
really creative inventions and that innovation falls someplace in between.
<br>
Spike might be one of the better persons to comment since he is a &quot;real&quot;
<br>
engineer.  The questions, as posed, create raise interesting points
<br>
as to what would be &quot;application&quot;, &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;invention&quot; in
<br>
areas such as software development or AI development.
