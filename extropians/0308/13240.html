<p>Eliezer, can you explain why you pick 1000-1 odds?  (You may want to
<br>
read my response to Robin's comments first.)  This would seem to
<br>
be pulling a number out of the hat.  It is beginning to look like
<br>
from the exoplanet searches that we are getting 1-in-50 solar systems
<br>
may have &quot;Earths&quot;.  Lineweaver's work suggests that *most* of them should
<br>
be much older than our &quot;Earth&quot;.  Dick's work (recently pointed out by
<br>
Anders) suggests we need to completely rethink when and where intelligence
<br>
may &quot;live&quot; due to the fact that much of it is much older than we are.
<br>
(I will suggest you may have conflicting investments in whether or not
<br>
there has or has not been a singularity within a single solar system
<br>
within this galaxy yet.)
<br>
<p>So the Fermi Paradox seems in my mind to be getting *much* tougher
<br>
to resolve.
<br>
<p>I would not disagree that our current state of technology may make
<br>
it extremely difficult to discover &quot;artifacts&quot;.  But that does not
<br>
suggest an 86% level of certainty that they are not out there (at
<br>
least to me).
