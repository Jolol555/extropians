Subject: Re: would you vote for this man?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have you been actually listening to what the man says?  If he doesn't have
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; power then he certainly doesn't disagree with much of anything that is
</em><br>
being
<br>
<em>&gt; done.  Quite the opposite.  If you believe the job has no real power then
</em><br>
why
<br>
<em>&gt; do we even bother with presidental elections?    Ever head of executive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orders?   The president actually has a great deal of power and it can do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great deal of damage in the hands of the wrong person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Maybe I was a bit too vague. He has executive powers, yes. But the &quot;resume&quot;
<br>
seemed to want to blame him for anything and everything that is going wrong
<br>
today, including the state of the economy. I really don't believe the
<br>
president has enough power to tank the economy, and if he did, why would he
<br>
do it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes he has spent a lot of money on the military.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No he hasn't stepped up to the late on energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But really, the economy is it's own monster. It was slowing down prior
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bush taking office. Sept. 11 didn;t help matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point is that Bush administration didn't do anything that helped
</em><br>
either.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree, but but isn;t alone in this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Sept 11 may have been an intelligence failure, but nothing is 100%. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many tips do they really get on terrorist plots? How many turn out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; real? How much can you change an organization like our intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; community in the 9 months that he had? You can;t shut down the airlines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every time someone threatens to attack our country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is more than a little material out there that his administration was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; briefed that something like this, something very much like 9/11, was in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; works.    But in any case his administration has actively suppressed full
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; impartial investigation into much of 9/11.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is a matter of hindsight being 20/20. The government cannot protect
<br>
anyone from a single nut or a bunch of fruitcakes that decide to murder
<br>
people. Any belief otherwise is simply a false sense of security. Freedom is
<br>
a double-edged sword. They may have made mistakes, but they are human and do
<br>
make them occasionally. We all do. I think this would be a similar problem
<br>
in any admistration, not just Bush.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think what we did in Afganistan was wrong. They had it coming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iraq is a different story, Saddam is a bastard who kills his own people
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the thousands. He has needed to go for a long time. The world will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better place without him. Do the ends justify the means? I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't go into the rather strange &quot;they had it coming&quot; at this time.
</em><br>
Nobody
<br>
<em>&gt; said Saddam was a nice guy.  But spending the US into oblivion to kick
</em><br>
butt
<br>
<em>&gt; in various parts of the MidEast to little good effect hardly seems the
</em><br>
mark
<br>
<em>&gt; of a good leader.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
One can hardly say we are spent into oblivion. We are here. The 1980s showed
<br>
that we can function quite fine with deficits and debt. But yes, I do agree
<br>
with your point that it has had little affect and as such hasn't been a
<br>
smart thing to do.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not a big fan of Bush, especially the way he invokes &quot;God&quot; at every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opportunity, but I think that this &quot;resume&quot; is rather juvenile and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; serves to polarize those that already dislike him. The President only
</em><br>
does
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what he thinks he needs to do to get re-elected. That's the way the
</em><br>
country
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was set up. To fix our problems, we need to change the way the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think, not sit around and complain about our leaders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually it is not at all 'juvenile'.  What is juvenile at best is
</em><br>
refusing to
<br>
<em>&gt; wake up and smell the coffeee.  It goes far beyond &quot;dislike&quot;.  The man and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his administration have objectively done much that lead to the reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion of that they are a tremendous menace to this country, to the
</em><br>
world
<br>
<em>&gt; and to all our fondest extropic goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I disagree. I don't see them as a tremendous menace. More like a thorn in my
<br>
side. They are pretty much like the others before them. I see two menaces,
<br>
an educatinal system that fails to educate and a religious majority. Until
<br>
these are fixed, our leaders will continue to make decisions that hurt us.
<br>
And they won;t &quot;fix&quot; these because that is where their power comes from. It
<br>
has to come from us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How do you &quot;fix how people think&quot; without putting out viewpoints such as
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; one you just called &quot;juvenile&quot;.  It was intended to get people to think
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
OK. If that was the intention, I'll grant that. It just seemed to me to be
<br>
more of a superficial attack rather than an informative piece. It doesn;t
<br>
get into the details very much.
<br>
