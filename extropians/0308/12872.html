<p>### You seem to be looking at managers from the underdog point-of-view - you
<br>
portray them as the powerful, dangerous, mean types, who can bite you if
<br>
they want, and get all the best bitches in the pack.
<br>
<p>Well, the greediest segment of the economy is not the manager. The manager
<br>
has very little individual power, his actions are channeled by the owners of
<br>
capital on one side, and consumers of goods on the other. US managers now
<br>
send jobs overseas because they can, thanks to technology. Just as railroads
<br>
allowed the sending of vegetable-growing jobs from Maine to Florida,
<br>
communications technology allows sending IT jobs to India. US managers send
<br>
jobs overseas because they have to - if they don't, somebody else will,
<br>
offer cheaper products to consumers and kill their company. Since the
<br>
capital owners want the manager to give a return on capital, and consumers
<br>
want him to organize the production of cheap but good quality goods, the
<br>
manager does their bidding.
<br>
<p>You are a consumer. If you have anything in a mutual fund (like I do), you
<br>
are a capitalist. It is you, the average American (well, not quite average,
<br>
you are on the Extrolist), who is responsible for sending jobs to India, by
<br>
your everyday choices.
<br>
<p>Start throwing away money on poor investments instead of quality funds,
<br>
start buying pricey local products instead of good foreign ones. Once you
<br>
have thus proven you are not greedy yourself, feel free to preach against
<br>
greed.
<br>
<p>Also, since the American middle class is overwhelmingly in possession of
<br>
capital (I am not including middle-class wannabes who are pretending they
<br>
are rich by spending on credit), the globalization of labor will only
<br>
benefit them - you can't shrink a capitalist by making his investments pay
<br>
more. American economy can only stabilized and expanded by cooperating with
<br>
good workers all over the world.
<br>
<p>Greed, channeled through a free market, is good.

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the Fortune 500 send their buddies, lobbyists to DC to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their way with this economy. Now its back-firing and according to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article in the Wall Street Journal, this will cost W the election.
</em><br>
<p>### Down with W!
