<em>&gt; ### While I agree with the specifics you provided this time, I have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protest that my initial objection (that you are using a taboo-tradeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejection) was well-justified from reading of your initial statement. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did say that individuals should be prevented from bargaining their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money and other considerations, by some persons &quot;morally responsible&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these individuals. I very strongly reject such limitation of freedom.
</em><br>
<p>They should be prevented, in NEGATIVE a way.  That is, the social 
<br>
structures that tend to coerce people into selling themselves (and 
<br>
under-selling themselves) should be removed.  The only way a person can 
<br>
be brought into a position where they bargain their lives for money is 
<br>
if the damage of force, corporatism and statism is already done.
<br>
<p>When you see thousands upon thousands of people put in the position of 
<br>
having to bargain for their lives, you know that something has gone 
<br>
desperately wrong, in general, it's economic oppression enforced by the 
<br>
state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### No, I don't think it is bad to use inhumanely cheap labor.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, well, I do.  Cf. the meaning of &quot;inhumanely&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no breach of contract, fraud, neglect of parental duties, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of resources, and no use of non-consensual violence, an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not immoral, according to my consequentialist ethical system.
</em><br>
<p>Here we are in partial agreement, although you don't want to extend 
<br>
&quot;non-consensual violence&quot; to economic pressure.  I do.  It's backhanded 
<br>
to say someone is freely entering into a contract if not accepting that 
<br>
contract would cause them irreperable harm (either economic, social, 
<br>
physical, etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes of actions which do not exhibit the features I mentioned are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed to improve the average well-being of humans, I consider such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions to be good or neutral until proven otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>I understand the ends justifying the means, however, I see that the 
<br>
ends are children living in puddles of their own pee.  You seem to 
<br>
think the ends are immortality or something.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ### Well, it is exactly the point - Nike is not forcing anybody to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; work for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, they come begging for work.
</em><br>
<p>You're right, Nike isn't forcing them, but their government is.  Nike 
<br>
is paying the government for that particular service.  Even more 
<br>
relevant, the largest shareholders of Nike are paying them for that 
<br>
service through the WTO and World Bank.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This said, the term &quot;unfair business practices&quot; has been used in very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vague
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, so I would need more details before agreeing on it. For me, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfair (=wrong, bad, unjust, immoral) business practices are the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involving breach of contract, fraud, neglect of parental duties, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of resources, and use of non-consensual violence (the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrote in a paragraph above). By this definition, protectionism is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business practice, contracting for child labor is not.
</em><br>
<p>Contracting for child labor ENABLED by protectionism?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### If you are talking about protecting the free market from state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interference, I am all for it.
</em><br>
<p>Definitely.  Including freedom of currency?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The a priori argument is simple - if Nike is allowed to continue its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; current &quot;Global Investment&quot; strategy, it will use its economic power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to perpetuate its power and in particular will invest in situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that will tend to keep labor cheap and profits high.  This will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; include sponsoring &quot;sub-humane&quot; labor conditions in third-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nations.  If they can find some military fiend to assist them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Burma, so much the better.  Similarly, the banks that own Nike will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; continue lending practices which empower those nation-states which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enforce sub-humane labor to continue that practice as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible and will seek to create new slave-states wherever possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and profitable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### No, poverty does not exist because of Nike, but despite Nike.
</em><br>
<p>Well, here we just have a plain disagreement.  Nike takes valuable 
<br>
resources from Burma and relocates them to the United States and takes 
<br>
the profits for themselves.  This has the generalized effect of making 
<br>
Burmese poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod.  Since the 
<br>
Burmese are becoming poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod, 
<br>
they are likely to be able to, if they so desire, perpetuate the system 
<br>
that impoverishes Burma.  Indeed, we know that this is the case BECAUSE 
<br>
IT IS HAPPENING.
<br>
<p>It happens both at the direct level - shoes and money for nike - and at 
<br>
the global-economic level.  Cash from the WTO (funded by Citigroup, 
<br>
Deutchebank, Credit Lyonnaise, Barclays, etc.) goes to the Government 
<br>
of Burma which then buys military supplies to ensure it's ongoing 
<br>
ability to enforce its rule over its people.  Meanwhile, Nike which is 
<br>
majority owned by those same interests, goes and takes advantage of the 
<br>
cheap labor created by the oppressive government.
<br>
<p>Do  you see it differently?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Businessmen invest where labor is cheap, thus causing labor to get more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive.
</em><br>
<p>What's the mechanism by which this happens exactly?  Can you site any 
<br>
historical precedent?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Businessmen do not keep people poor. Politicians do.
</em><br>
<p>Technically, they work together to keep people poor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Businessmen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can only become a force of evil if they buy the services of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicians and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; armies, which is actually a rare occurrence. In most cases, political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems *feed* on business, not the other way around.
</em><br>
<p>Are you familiar at all with the World Bank?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; On the other hand, if we were to call the owners of Nike to account
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; PERSONALLY for the actions of the corporation, for instance, by making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it illegal to be an owner of a company that utilizes child-labor or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; forced labor or sub-poverty labor, then we'd have something worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Owners of Nike (I might be one too, I haven't looked at the list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stocks in my mutual funds for a long time) should not held responsible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their actions, beyond the value of the stock they bought, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordance with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the law.
</em><br>
<p>Well, since &quot;the law&quot; was set up specifically to prevent the owners of 
<br>
Nike from taking any responsibility WHATEVER for the actions of their 
<br>
corporation, here we just have a straight disagreement.  The law really 
<br>
should be changed to make the owners of a company jointly and severally 
<br>
responsible for the &quot;official&quot; actions of the company.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It should not be illegal to utilize child-labor, or sub-poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor (whatever this might mean), since it is not immoral for children 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor people to contract for sale of their labor. Only the use of forced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor is wrong, since it involves non-consensual violence.
</em><br>
<p>How often, would you say, are children sold into slavery consensually?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Liability of joint stock corporations for harms inflicted can easily be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handled by a compulsory, free-market liability insurance.
</em><br>
<p>You think this would make things better for the people living in mud 
<br>
huts?  Once again, can you explain the mechanism?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The correct way of helping poor children is to offer education support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (perhaps in the form of a loan) and protection from abusive parents, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than prosecuting persons who offer gainful employment to them.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I hear your claim, but the mechanism has been around FOREVER and 
<br>
yet, there they are, children playing in pee in the streets because the 
<br>
sewage has never worked...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The correct way of helping poor people in general is to offer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employment to them (or removing the political obstacles to it, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely agree with you),
</em><br>
<p>How about enabling them to become productive themselves by releasing 
<br>
the ownership of their property to them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; perhaps more attractive than wages at Nike - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not trying to shut down Nike by political fiat.
</em><br>
<p>No one's trying to shut down nike.  Just make Nike play nice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, prosecuting &quot;villains&quot; is a more exciting path than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping others to a better life by a consensual exchange of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so the former strategy achieves undue prominence.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Being a missionary is ONE good way of directly helping poor 
<br>
children in Burma.  Will that solve the long-term problems there?  No.
<br>
<p>If you look at the workers of an impoverished country as desperate for 
<br>
work, what incentive could someone capable of providing better wages 
<br>
have for actually going and competing for resources in that country.  
<br>
It's bad business.  If Nike is paying $2/day, Addidas wants to pay $1.  
<br>
So if Nike is doing business in Burma, Addidas will go to Angola.  
<br>
That's how &quot;REAL BUSINESS&quot; works.
<br>
<p>Do you seriously think that we're going to run out of poor countries in 
<br>
which workers can be exploited?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good missionary would want both short-term comfort for the poor and 
<br>
long-term abating of the conditions that contribute to poverty - 
<br>
including and especially Globalized Banking.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
