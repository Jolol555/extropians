<em>&gt; Depends on what you mean by the term &quot;support&quot;.  If

</em><br>
<p>No, it isn't in the least sufficient.  My dad managed to support a family of 7 
<br>
in the 60s on about $9K/yr.  We weren't well off but we ate and had a house 
<br>
and such.  I know of no way to support a family of 4 on the approximately 14K 
<br>
today that minimum salary would bring.  Certainly not anywhere around here 
<br>
(bay area) and nowhere I know of anywhere in the country.  Certainly not in 
<br>
my home town either.    If you know differently then please prove it.  It 
<br>
would be nice to know money could be made to go this far.  It would greatly 
<br>
shorten the time I can work only on what I most care about regardless of what 
<br>
I can get paid for. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We expect more now, so it should
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsistence level survival is cheaper and easier now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than ever before, and getting more so all the time.
</em><br>
<p>This is not my experience in the least.  Please back up these fantastic 
<br>
assertions or drop them.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One needn't even work: standing on a city streetcorner
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the donations needed to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...Then, you could pay for a piece of land capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustaining your own family within 7 years by working...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today you can earn enough to support yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a similar manner by working only a few months.
</em><br>
<p>You are speaking utter krap.
