<p><em>&gt; That may be, but how much more malice is generated through honest

</em><br>
<p>Malice by definition excludes bad results from honest mistakes.  Malice 
<br>
requires deliberate harmful action.   For instance, I have a difficult time 
<br>
chalking up to stupidity actions by our government that given their premises 
<br>
and a bit of intelligence, look very much like planned implementation of said 
<br>
premises.  Yet most people refuse to see this because seeing it is 
<br>
frightening and dispiriting.  They would prefer to believe that these actions 
<br>
simply came from stupidity.    The premises may well be &quot;stupid&quot; but the 
<br>
carrying out of those premises required malice aforethought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its natural to think that if someone does something that harms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us that harm must have been their intent (and I'm sure Eliezer can give a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better description than me as to why), but in the complex world we live in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its hard to judge the impact of our actions on everyone they effect, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we do try.  When someone stupidly argues for/against the war with Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or immigration your opponent is probably not out to destroy America, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it pays to remember this.
</em><br>
<p>The particular purpose behind a bit of malice might be hard to discern, e.g., 
<br>
in the above the purpose of any position on that issue most likely had 
<br>
nothing to do with &quot;destroying America&quot;.   Nor was I referring to simply an 
<br>
opposing position on some issue or other.  I don't consider the possibility 
<br>
of malice in such trite cases generally unless there is a likely connection 
<br>
to other observed actions of sufficient extensiveness and thought.   I am 
<br>
much more interested in cases where those in power seem to me to be executing 
<br>
a well thought out plan which is ignored under the rule-of-thumb of assuming 
<br>
stupidity instead of malice.  I am particularly interested when such apparent 
<br>
steps in a plan are more or less exactly what I would have done in their 
<br>
position if I shared their premises and worldview.     If we apply the 
<br>
bromide about stupidity vs malice too broadly we are apt to ignore too much.
