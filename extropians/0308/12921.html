FWIW:  In Africa they still spay with DDT.  The mosquitos, however, have 
<br>
evolved various resistances that makes it less effective against them.  
<br>
(Avoiding it is one of the one's I've heard mentioned.)  So that 20 
<br>
million has some other explantion.  I can accept that &quot;At the height of 
<br>
DDT spraying deaths from malaria numbered in the single to low double 
<br>
digits every year.&quot;, but resistances take time to evolve, so the 
<br>
argument doesn't carry (i.e., I can accept that if you mean single digit 
<br>
millions).
<br>
<p>OTOH, DDT has many more effects than just killing off mosquitos.  I 
<br>
don't think we even know all of them, but most of the &quot;side effects&quot; 
<br>
that I've heard of have been deleterious, though not clearly in the same 
<br>
range as 20 million lives.  But then they didn't stop spraying, so that 
<br>
figure has to have some other explantion.  Possibly one that a bit more 
<br>
complicated, or possibly something as simple as &quot;they changed their 
<br>
method of counting cases&quot;.  (You don't mention what the +or- error bars 
<br>
are.)
