</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It's interesting how free-enterprise slash unfettered
<br>
capitalism slash free-marketeers suddenly change their
<br>
tune when the &quot;downturn in the business cycle&quot; hits
<br>
them personally.  If a conservative is a liberal who's
<br>
been mugged, then a born again liberal is a
<br>
conservative who's been &quot;downsized&quot;.  However, I'm not
<br>
here to gloat or do the &quot;I told you so&quot; dance.  
<br>
<p>Capitaism has its problems, as does socialism.  The
<br>
bottom line is that life is a bumpy ride, no matter
<br>
&quot;the system&quot; and, at the risk of seeming like a Miss
<br>
America contestant, we need to be prepared, when
<br>
bruised by act of god or man, to help each other out. 
<br>
<p><p>I have no problem with the underlying theory of
<br>
capitalism: one works, generates a surplus, invests
<br>
the surplus so as to further increase their wealth.
<br>
<p>But the simple reasonableness of this principle--which
<br>
increases the wealth of the individual AND the wealth
<br>
of the community--can be corrupted by (among other
<br>
things) greed coupled with systemic structural flaws. 
<br>
This is where I would suggest a qualifier to Mitch's
<br>
indictment of the managerial class.  
<br>
<p>Structural flaws provide the opportunity to take
<br>
advantage of &quot;the system&quot; (corporate and
<br>
governemnt)and aggrandized oneself at the expense of
<br>
others.  And, tending to make matters much worse is
<br>
the further flaw in the system, whereby abusing it
<br>
confers an advantage, ie. crime pays, and the crime of
<br>
one, like a cancer, infects, compels, encourages, and
<br>
for a while legitimizes, the crime/corruption of
<br>
others.  &quot;Everyone was doing it.&quot;
<br>
<p>The structural flaw as I see it lies in the unbalanced
<br>
power of exectutives and massive non-accountability. 
<br>
They make the decisions, make the rules, control the
<br>
paper trail.  When the shepherd is the wolfman, look
<br>
out for the full moon.  Same problem as when the coke
<br>
dealer starts dipping into his inventory.  It's
<br>
Rousseau's cautionary note on representative
<br>
government: &quot;How do you keep the representatives from
<br>
serving themselves at the expense of their
<br>
constituents?&quot;  Just so, corporate execs can stray
<br>
from the ethical path and cook the books.  Plus the
<br>
government is right in there with them--the other
<br>
executive class(small &quot;e&quot;, includes the congress and
<br>
the judiciary)--infected by and contributing to the
<br>
corruption.  Two words: campaign finance.  Then,
<br>
having been bought, they make the laws governing
<br>
corporate structure, regulation, and third party
<br>
oversight.  A guild of meta-foxes in charge of the
<br>
henhouse nation.
<br>
<p>But not all managers are corrupt.  Not even most. 
<br>
They're a necessary part of the engine of production,
<br>
the more highly skilled, the more valuable.(Well,
<br>
duh!) Give 'em their due, don't lump them all with the
<br>
bad apples. And they're all human, like you and me.
<br>
<p>Regarding the idea that managers are somehow unworthy
<br>
because they run businesses but rarely build them: it
<br>
seems entirely reasonable to me that these are two
<br>
different specialties, running vs building.  At least
<br>
that's a theory I've heard somewhere.  Why not?  And
<br>
those skilled at one may not be as skilled at the
<br>
other.  
<br>
<p>So fix the problem.  Stop the war before it becomes a
<br>
war.  Correct the structural flaws.  Spread out the
<br>
power, strengthen oversight, put some teeth into
<br>
accountability.
<br>
<p>And regarding accountablity, I have a dream.  Take all
<br>
the corporate and government rat bastards and put them
<br>
in a fenced in (as opposed to gated) community.  A
<br>
community of tar-paper, dirt floor shacks.  On one
<br>
side, the up-wind side, is the local sewage treatment
<br>
plant, on another the local freeway, elevated and
<br>
gently banked so the passers-by can get a good look;
<br>
the garbage dump and local recycling center on a
<br>
third--with open access to the pariah class so they
<br>
may freely avail themselves of home furnishings and
<br>
other collectables--and on the forth perhaps a
<br>
pleasant little park slash community garden,...built
<br>
atop a &quot;reclaimed&quot; toxic waste dump.  And each morning
<br>
a fleet of rusty, clanking, old school busses, like
<br>
those used to transport farmworkers and Baptists,
<br>
arrives at the freeway bus stop to pick them up and
<br>
take them to work, cleaning out the grease traps in
<br>
the fast food outlets of the world, there to be looked
<br>
down upon by their betters, the pimple-faced teen-age
<br>
burger-flippers and third-world immigrant ethicists.  
<br>
<p><p>For all eternity.
<br>
<p>Or not.  And wait for the war.    
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And I think to myself, what a wonderful world!&quot;
<br>
