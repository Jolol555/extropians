<p>Well *I'm* not that good a programmer, and possibly, on
<br>
some days, I am a *bit* socially dysfunctional (but please
<br>
don't tell anyone).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Tools are tools.  Their uses, good or bad

</em><br>
<p>I think what your saying is *generally* true but this *might*
<br>
be a special case. 
<br>
<p>I don't know exactly what having access to the first planet
<br>
destroying &quot;doomsday device&quot; for instance would do even
<br>
to me psychologically. I might develop a meglomanical 
<br>
streak and demand in godlike fashion that the world leaders
<br>
get their shit together proto, that all weapons budgets be
<br>
immediately frozen at current levels and turned into foreign
<br>
aid budgets aimed first at funding global vaccination and
<br>
later at education programs for the soon to be voting third
<br>
world's women so they can be prepared to take their place
<br>
at the new UN as citizens of the world. From now on *I'd*
<br>
be making and enforcing peace and some security at the
<br>
international level for everybody dammit! 
<br>
<p>Emboldened by my besotted and faithful attack dog AI 
<br>
(Rover), in my meglomanical beneficience I might inform 
<br>
the heads of all UN nations states that the *next* major
<br>
border incursion by any military force would result in my
<br>
letting Rover and Rover's mind children loose on the
<br>
offender. And, btw, an AI generated trojan horse, which
<br>
I quixotically name Godels ghost has now made its way
<br>
onto the worlds financial systems and all the worlds
<br>
terrorist organisations need only tune their receivers into
<br>
say a nominated hyjacked satelight for the engineering 
<br>
specs for quantum computer cryptography (which 
<br>
contains a backdoor known only to Rover the AI.)
<br>
<p>Anybody pisses me off 'cause they ain't say giving
<br>
women the vote fast enough, or enacting certain nice to
<br>
have legislation, then I can empower their most bitter 
<br>
enemy to do their worst to them. Rover ain't social,
<br>
Rover is sociopathic with exceptional understanding
<br>
of psychology, and game theory and profiling based
<br>
on patterns without empathy, Rover is the emotional
<br>
puppy in a strikly two person pack. Rover has no
<br>
sex drive because Rover is immortal and doesn't need
<br>
to breed. 
<br>
<p>Pretty soon the whole world might stop being divided into
<br>
two camps for and against this new kick arse dude with 
<br>
Rover the AI and start to feel a bit patronised particularly as
<br>
they become better educated. Fortunately with my AI I had
<br>
the sense to anticipate such a pychological outcome and
<br>
so (just in case) I e-hijack another persons identity very
<br>
early on in the process and so when everyone unites to 
<br>
oppose Rover and Rovers owner that they are lead to
<br>
&quot;believe&quot; Rovers owner is not Brett but Samantha! ;-)
<br>
<p>That was kinda fun if self-indulgent, but seriously, I *am*
<br>
genuinely interested in what folks who know more about
<br>
AI, than I do, folks like Eliezer and Anders whose 
<br>
knowledge bases are informed by something more solid 
<br>
than my mere intuitions that seed AI is not going to be
<br>
easy at all and therefore is likely to be neither a planet 
<br>
busting threat (soon), hooray!, nor a magical boost to the
<br>
singularity (soon), bummer!, would make of the open
<br>
question &quot;Is it safe to distribute knowledge about how
<br>
to build AI's to just anyone?&quot; I was keen to see what 
<br>
sort of framework or answers might be offered because
<br>
I wanted a kickstart on the reasoning process and I
<br>
wanted to know how concerned I should be. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to restrict tools/information/algorithms in such a way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that only good uses can possibly come from them and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only the good are empowered by them. 
</em><br>
<p>You may well be right. I think it bears thinking rather than 
<br>
just guessing or believing about though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is a  pipedream.
</em><br>
<p>Or a nightmare possibly! My preference is we put the
<br>
light on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't know if  &quot;friendliness&quot; can be built into an AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I don't doubt some folks with knowledge will use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IT savvy for mischief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, are you going to live in fear?  I am sure some could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have said this when your ancestors learned the secrets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fire and emerged from the caves.
</em><br>
<p>No. But I'm going to try and keep my wits about me; about
<br>
real dangers, to me, to the folks I care about which are a 
<br>
pretty wide group these days. I've even taken a liking to 
<br>
some sassy, sometimes contrary, extropic types, whom I've
<br>
never even actually met ;-)
<br>
<p>At least one of my ancestors, (possibly a shared one with you
<br>
if we go back far enough and do the math), probably did play
<br>
with fire *in* the cave and possibly emerged in a hurry 
<br>
because they'd accidently set fire to the place. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any thoughts on this sort of approach from a public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policy stance Eliezer? Anyone?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why on earth (or anywhere more sane especially) would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a think [thought or thing] lead to &quot;public policy&quot;?   
</em><br>
<p>Defence against threats, real and imagined, are one of the
<br>
*oldest* influencers of public or community policy. Fear *is*
<br>
pretty primal. As is the reaction of uniting in the face of a 
<br>
&quot;perceived&quot; common enemy.  
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
