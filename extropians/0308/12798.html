<p>Since we seem to be moving farther and farther away from words like 
<br>
extropian and extropianism, it will mostt likely become a moot 
<br>
point.  Words like Extropy and Extropic will most likely become terms used 
<br>
for innovative thinking and reliability.
<br>
<p>You are certainly an &quot;extropic&quot; thinker.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2 - Pretty close to it, but I'm still having trouble comitting, even after

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not just California type of group, but any local.  Transhumanism gets the 
<br>
same type of response, but will fair well because there are so many 
<br>
different organizations within transhumanity to balance it out.
