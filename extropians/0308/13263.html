<em>&gt; The article mentions peanuts as another source, although I don't know how to

<p><p>Yes, this latest news really seems to fit well into what has come before.

Can't wait to see these compounds down at Walmart. 
<br>
<p>ALso, did anyone see teh article about the Aussie boffins who worked out a 
<br>
way to include omega 3 fatties into bread loaves?  I was going to post that, 
<br>
but forgot.
<br>
<p>Well, I am now off to drink some red wine, eat stressed peanuts, and peruse

some porn....
