<p>
It's more than a quarter of a century since I read John Brunner's stunning
<br>
sf novel THE SHOCKWAVE RIDER, and I'd forgotten this prescient element:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.skypoint.com/members/gimonca/brunner.html">http://www.skypoint.com/members/gimonca/brunner.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; Brunner's future in &quot;Shockwave Rider&quot; includes an info-futures betting
<br>
pool called Delphi. Even as people struggle to keep up with the tiring pace
<br>
of technological change, they can win money by betting on the next
<br>
breakthrough. (There is info-futures betting for entertainment only on the
<br>
Internet today at <a href="http://if.arc.ab.ca/IF.shtml">http://if.arc.ab.ca/IF.shtml</a>). Brunner sees this not as a
<br>
free-market instrument, but as a tool to be manipulated by government
<br>
bureaucrats who fiddle with the odds: &quot;What the public currently yearned
<br>
for could be deduced by watching the betting, and steps could be taken to
<br>
ensure that what was feasible was done, and what was not was carefully
<br>
deeveed. It was a task that taxed the skills of top CIMA experts to ensure
<br>
that when the government artificially cut Delphi odds to distract attention
<br>
from something undesirable no other element in the mix was dragged down
<br>
with it.&quot; What appears on the outside to be freedom is actually government
<br>
control by information feedback. &gt;
