Mike Lorrey explained the discontinuation of the policy analysis market
<br>
(PAM) with a  parody:
<br>
&quot;Because betting or futures markets are crass commercialism, propounded
<br>
by evil running dog capitalists..... liberals don't understand how
<br>
futures markets work. They just puts their money into their 401k and
<br>
depend on the smart people to make them money...&quot;
<br>
Following up on the logic of this parody,  what does it means to be from
<br>
&quot;the left&quot;?
<br>
It is a matter of perception.
<br>
Not being from &quot;the left&quot; = when looking at &quot;the big picture&quot;, first
<br>
percieving the self,  then the street, the city,  the country then the other
<br>
countries further and furthe away...
<br>
From the point of view of the rich/privilegied this adds-up into to thinking
<br>
:&quot;what to do to make this situation last forever?&quot;.
<br>
Being from &quot;the left&quot; is the opposite of this, seeing the edges first:  the
<br>
world, the continent, the country, the city, the street, the self.
<br>
It is to percieve the horizon and knowing the absolute injustices won't be
<br>
able to last very longer... ex : people dying of hunger etc it will last for
<br>
how long? another 100 years tops? These are the problems to solve. For
<br>
someone from the left, problems of the third world are closer than problems
<br>
of vis neighbourhod.
<br>
<p>To prove wrong someone who wold say &quot;The idea of a federal betting parlor on
<br>
atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous and it's grotesque&quot; and prevent PAM
<br>
to be percieved by the majority as &quot; morally wrong&quot;, &quot;offensive to almost
<br>
everyone&quot; and a  &quot;sick game&quot;,   I think a solution could be to add a new
<br>
module to the idea, a form of electronic jurisprudence where people would
<br>
have the opportunity to be pro-active at the horrors and injustices of this
<br>
world instead of just being percieved as &quot;passive observers who are
<br>
cynically cashing-in&quot; .  I would like to hear constructive inputs on how
<br>
this  &quot;e-jurisprudence&quot; could be implemented legally and technically into
<br>
&quot;idea futures&quot; so &quot;the evil running dog capitalists&quot; will be able to have
<br>
what they want out of it while giving the opportunity to make new
<br>
laws/challenge existing inefficacious laws (speeding-up the evolution of the
<br>
judiciary system might I hazard) on different issues (not just on
<br>
terrorism).
<br>
<p>Deleuze said (I translated as close as I could) : &quot;It is jurisprudence that
<br>
really is creating rights: it should not be left to judges. We are already
<br>
thinking about establishing modern biology rights: but everything, in modern
<br>
biology and the new situations that it is creating, the new elements it
<br>
makes possible, is jurisprudence business. It is not a committee of
<br>
wisemens, moral and pseudo-competent, that we need, but users groups.&quot;
<br>
To Deleuze, a government cannot be from the left, there can only be
<br>
government that are either more or less favorable to the issues of the left
<br>
so he says that stopping injustices with jurisprudence is a very good
<br>
example of what being from &quot;the left&quot; really is.
<br>
<p>The concept of &quot;laws&quot; and &quot;human rights&quot; are empty and complacent, what is
<br>
important is what's going on in the real world: the concrete problems of
<br>
life. All of the problems out there in the world are problems of
<br>
&quot;territory&quot;, one just have to identify the territory concerned in the
<br>
problematic and arrange the law to stop the injustice so everyone will get
<br>
an appropriate territory to be happy.
<br>
Jurisprudence is the ensemble of decisions made by courts of law about these
<br>
concrete situations of life, including cases where the law is
<br>
re-routed, when we are not in accord with it. Globally there are laws, we
<br>
are submiting to it in our structures and behind it there is jurisprudence,
<br>
wich feeds the law and makes it evolve. When jurisprudence gets too big, the
<br>
law becomes obsolete and we are obliged to modify it. This is what is
<br>
interesting in the democratic system: I acknowledge that there is a law but
<br>
nothing impeach us to modify it.
<br>
By pointing out where confidence is lacking on various aspects of various
<br>
troublesome parts of the world, betting markets such as the Policy Analysis
<br>
Market could help to increase the production of judgements of courts of law
<br>
from these places. If something bad is likely to happen evidently some
<br>
people will suffer from it and it is up to them to sue to prevent it to
<br>
happen, to request a solution for their problem of territory using
<br>
jurisprudence either to apply solutions coming from similar cases or make a
<br>
new one if needed.
<br>
&nbsp;Access to internet still being patchy, this e-jurisprudence would be easyer
<br>
to implement in occidental countries at first but while waiting for more's
<br>
law to solve this problem, it's not that hard to imagine a non profit org
<br>
who would be created to distribute internet access to hotspots around the
<br>
world to give a voice to the people concerned by the bad stuff that is going
<br>
down, so as many people as possible could use these &quot; virtual tribunals&quot;
<br>
with their local laws to make things change. (In any case it is not like we
<br>
are short of problems right here at home, that could be solved with this
<br>
idea...) Problems should be solved regionally; interventions of an
<br>
international  police would not cut it IMO.
<br>
It would be interesting to see the e-jurisprudence formulated by people who
<br>
have a better understanding of the law than me / who are more inspired when
<br>
it comes at making-up scenarii despicting how it would be used in real life.
<br>
<p>If PAM is not truly dead yet, each one of us should write them ideas to
<br>
improve on it so we'll see it happen. Anyone knows who should be contacted
<br>
about this?
