<em>&gt; &gt; The standard keyphrase for this is &quot;distribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system&quot;.  Put simply: how do you get those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; set up in the first place?  (Yes, there are gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stations now, but how do you pay for refitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the robots you mention prior to enough people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; having these cars to make it economically viable? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chicken-and-the-egg type problem.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree this is a problem, but it is a political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem not a technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem as was  the suggestion in the original post.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But just because it's a political (and
<br>
economic) problem doesn't mean it's an easy one to
<br>
solve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the extant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political economy, I would favor some heavy tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brakes to help the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bootstrapping problem and let the market work out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the details.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, that's one common solution.  Problem: where
<br>
does the money to pay for this come from?
<br>
<p>Related example: if you could suggest a way for
<br>
California to fund more solar power production, in a
<br>
way likely to bring higher tax revenues within one
<br>
year (*maybe* two), there are a hundred-odd people
<br>
over here who might like to co-opt your idea for
<br>
actual use (and for furthering their bids).  One
<br>
possibility: make the power companies pay for any
<br>
and all excess generation that homes actually do
<br>
(possibly up to some limit: homes are homes, not -
<br>
primarily - power generation substations), but tax
<br>
said revenues.  Then, put tax breaks on installing
<br>
solar such that solar panels become a reasonable
<br>
investment.  The ultimate source of money?  Power
<br>
exported to other states.  Problem: would the tax
<br>
breaks actually tax away more money themselves, than
<br>
would be generated as revenue in the short term?
<br>
(Political calculations unfortunately don't always
<br>
allow for long-term considerations.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Having operated an EV1 before they were scrapped,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can tell you that your dream - in this regard - is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right-on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lucky bastard!
</em><br>
<p>I see what I wish for, and I strive to achieve it
<br>
where I can.
<br>
<p>Besides, I just happened to need a new car about the
<br>
time the second generation came out.  ^_-
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was under the impression that many of the ev1's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the lead acid ones) had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 110 charge option, which would mean you could plug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in anywhere with outlet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you could borrow a few amps? No?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but that was the first generation - max range
<br>
around 60 miles.  Much less usable.  Generation two
<br>
could not accept the 110 charge option, in exchange
<br>
for roughly double range.
