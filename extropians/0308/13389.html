</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unusual ideas is going to end up impoverished and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intolerant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I wonder if one could get some of Richard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Florida's ideas about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the creative class moves in here. Essentially, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a place like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Michigan shows that it does not tolerate the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cryonics and tounge splitting) it sends a signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cultural creatives that increasingly form the core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of economic growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that this is not the place to be. It does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter that most never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would even consider getting a suspension or split
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tounge, they know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that their own particular interests or views might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be circumscribed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and that the area is less likely to attract other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - so they go elsewhere. Is that a desired signal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I fully agree with the above (maybe it's my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Polishness). There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to antagonize an official who may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally an enemy, and even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he is, sounding too strident is in bad taste. By all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means, those who wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to contact Hollister on CI's behalf should try for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoned if firm tone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along exactly the lines of Ander's thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm mostly in agreement with Anders and Rafal, but....
<br>
<p>It has been my experience that when rationalists use a
<br>
measured rational tone when confronting emotionalists
<br>
or politicians, the latter 
<br>
interpreting this as weakness, are emboldened, and the
<br>
former get eaten for lunch.  The essence of political
<br>
professionalism is to be polite even 
<br>
while they slip the knife between your victims ribs. 
<br>
Now, I am aware of how inflammatory this sounds, but
<br>
frankly I'm pissed.  And I think that sometimes it is
<br>
necessary, as Shakespeare said, to: 
<br>
<p>Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
<br>
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
<br>
<p>I'm perfectly thrilled to have all the silly people
<br>
with their favorite silly belief systems frolic to
<br>
their hearts content.  I'm even ready to stand in
<br>
solidarity with them to protect this right.  But I'll
<br>
be damned if I'll stand idly or POLITELY by while they
<br>
strip me of the same rights, even to the point of
<br>
marching me into the grave or cremation chamber. 
<br>
There is a time for &quot;aggressive&quot;, and when that time
<br>
comes, sooner--as in &quot;nip it in the bud&quot;--is better
<br>
than later.
<br>
<p>Now, regarding my letter being used as a template, I'm
<br>
flattered, but I think that idea should be discarded. 
<br>
Natasha asked for a template, but 
<br>
frankly, my letter ain't it.  It has all manner of
<br>
flaws for such usage, not the least of which is that a
<br>
slew of similar letters would look like some kind of
<br>
cultish activism with me as the cult leader, and I 
<br>
really, really, don't think we want to go there.  I
<br>
know I don't.  But as I said, if you find some useful
<br>
bit in any of my ranting, feel free.
<br>
<p>If you want to do a good cop/bad cop whipsaw on this
<br>
Hollister creature, I'll be happy to be the bad cop.
<br>
<p>Finally, what I find astonishing and particularly
<br>
infuriating are (1) that Hollister may be using the
<br>
Cryonics Institute as a &quot;soft target&quot; for his personal
<br>
political advancement, and (2) that the underlying
<br>
&quot;religious&quot; fanaticism that fuels this whole business
<br>
is --un-flippin-believable-- the religion of,...wait
<br>
for it....
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***!!! BASEBALL!!!***
<br>
<p>I'm sorry.  
<br>
<p>I gotta die for flippin baseball???!!!
<br>
<p>Hold me the fuck down--pardon my French-- 'cause I'm
<br>
seriously gonna be losin' it. 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;For centuries our race has built on false
<br>
assumptions.  If you build a fantasy based on a false
<br>
assumption and continue to build on such a fantasy,
<br>
your whole existence becomes a lie which you implant
<br>
in others who are too lazy or too busy to question
<br>
it's truth.&quot; - Michael Moorcock
