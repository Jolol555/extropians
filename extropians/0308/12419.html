<p><em>&gt; &gt;That would be my guess too. Adding &quot;ism&quot; seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be a way of caricaturising a set of ideas thereby making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it easier to attack. But it's one thing to be caricaturised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;by those who one would naturally expect opposition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;from and another to have one's confederates encourage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;such caricaturisation by adopting their language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, I think Robert was simply continuing to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the term used by Sebasti[e]n Chikara.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Alas, I think we have not seen the last of such 'own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;goal' terminology as extropes talking of extropianism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or critical thinkers professing their 'beliefs'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Euh...  As pointed out by Freematt:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.extropy.org/ideas/principles.html">http://www.extropy.org/ideas/principles.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropianism -- the evolving transhumanist philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of extropy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes point taken. Perhaps the philosophy will yet evolve
<br>
beyond such unfortunate minor 'toe shootings', perhaps
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>But there is a reason for the version numbering, its to
<br>
indicate that the principles are not a matter of dogma
<br>
and that constructive criticism is welcome.
<br>
<p>There is also a reason for branding and I am not speaking
<br>
on behalf of ExI now just stating my own opinion. Brands,
<br>
like flags, serve as rallying points around which likeminded
<br>
individuals may gather. When likeminded individuals wish
<br>
to influence policy and the lawmaking process that will
<br>
crystalise particular futures from a range of possible ones
<br>
it helps to have some set of principles around which to
<br>
gather. Branding is therefore not merely about novelty for
<br>
novelty sake it is about utility. Personally I would rather
<br>
explain the simple principle of extropy as opposed to that
<br>
of entropy (which is pretty widely understood) and point
<br>
that someone in the direction of this mailing list and the ExI
<br>
principles then to have to wrestle with that someones
<br>
perception and possible misunderstanding of a variety of
<br>
other viewpoints and philosophers that may or may not
<br>
have contributed to the principles that are espoused now.
<br>
<p>A relatively new brand, like ExI, has the opportunity, at
<br>
least for a while, to manage and minimise the baggage it
<br>
carries. But against this minimisation of negative historic
<br>
associations there is the burden of establishing a recognition
<br>
of the brand in its own right.
<br>

what you wrote in other threads but I think I've caught the

gist of some of it.]
