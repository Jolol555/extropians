<em>&gt; The problem with things like this is, they assume data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's mostly been false, but is hard to disprove.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For instance, stating that economically viable natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gas deposits are mostly exhausted: such a claim has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been made before, yet new discoveries opened up - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a slight increase in profit (higher price from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scarcity, lower cost from new tech, take your pick)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made more discoveries viable.  But how does someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in the oil industry (and thus suspect to having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made-up data themselves) disprove this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or more simply: bluntly stating that wind and solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can not, under any conditions, &quot;replace even a portion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hydrocarbon energy&quot; - despite the fact that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite evidently have provided power that, had these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies never been invented, would come from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sources, presumably including hydrocarbon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy.
</em><br>
<p>I think he meant a significant portion. I don't know enough to comment on
<br>
this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know how many times I've seen this argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before.  I don't know how many times I'll see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again.
</em><br>
<p>More :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, there are some truths here, especially the bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about transmission capability not being built.  Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just argues more for home-ready sources of power, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar cells, that can be installed where the power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be used.  (This can be in development, tax
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credits, or other things that lessen the cost to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end user.)  One of my 2050ish pipe dreams is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helium-3 fusion, made possible in part by lunar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mining, to become economical for home use: a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely automated fusion reactor capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powering a standard home, no larger or costlier than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard refrigerator, with enough fuel to last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several years between servicing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Nice pipe dream!
<br>
<p>The biggest hole I always see in energy network setups is the lack of
<br>
facility for efficient storage of power generated in non-peak periods. I
<br>
suspect that's because no such facility exists. Imagine if it did, though...
<br>
solar power, for instance, becomes far more viable if you can actually store
<br>
it usefully for use during the night.
<br>
<p>Why is storage of electricity so difficult? We seem to be plagued by it,
<br>
from the small scale (mobile devices, implants, always limited by cruddy
<br>
power storage capabilities), through to the large scale (no way to store
<br>
large amounts of power for when it is needed). 
<br>
<p>I found some nice info about Flywheel energy storage here...
<br>
<a href="http://rpm2.8k.com/basics.htm">http://rpm2.8k.com/basics.htm</a>
<br>
and here
<br>
<a href="http://www.asi.org/adb/04/03/03/flywheel-energy-storage.html">http://www.asi.org/adb/04/03/03/flywheel-energy-storage.html</a>
<br>
<p>It leaves me wondering about massive flywheel arrays the size of
<br>
conventional power plants, run up to speed off peak, and drawn from during
<br>
peak times. Is this an entirely impractical notion? I imagine the tensile
<br>
strength at the rim would have to be phenomenal for a fast spinning 3
<br>
story-high flywheel. Also, imagine one of those babies breaking loose!
