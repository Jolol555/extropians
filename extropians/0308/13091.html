Robert Said:

<p><em> &gt;So by preserving the meme that one &quot;will&quot; die, you don't have
</em><br>
<em> &gt;to break the entire christianity/death/salvation meme-set.
</em><br>
<p>Robert, just curious, but by preserve the 'death' meme, are you suggesting 
<br>
an afterlife awaits us after death? Or, is death simply oblivion?  Or, am I 
<br>
missing some other option you have in mind?
<br>
<p>Thanks for clarifying this for me.  I hope I'm not asking a question that's 
<br>
been asked a hundred times before.

<p><p>==========================
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><em>&gt;On Sat, 16 Aug 2003, Alex Future Bokov asked about how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spread the memes without blowing &quot;belief&quot; fuses...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's not particularly good memetics to use the L-word (life extension) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; front of faculty members.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, citing an article in Science will have a pretty good impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on any serious faculty member [1].  As will pointing out the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of companies now working on aging [2].  And a serious attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the conditions associated with aging (such as Aubrey has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed [3]) will tend to silence the objections of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more educated in medicine.  Its not a question of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let alone make fun of Christianity... especially in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Texas of all places. They don't believe me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One way to spin this is to point out that we aren't talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;immortality&quot; (that is what tends to blow the &quot;belief&quot; fuses I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think).  Much better to point out that we are talking about extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;healthful life (gerotologists call this making the longevity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;curve &quot;rectangular&quot;).  As Damien pointed out in the Spike and Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Freitas pointed out at a recent Alcor conference [4] (and was obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to me back at Extro3 so many years ago...) you cannot beat the hazard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;function (at least not as humans are currently instantiated).  Probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the best you can do is something like 2000-7000 years unless you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really push on the hazard function by reengineering the human body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with nanotechnology and even then it is still very very difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to trump the hazard function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(So by preserving the meme that one &quot;will&quot; die, you don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to break the entire christianity/death/salvation meme-set.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One simply replaces the concept of a death that may be prolonged
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and painful with the image of a much longer life -- where one gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to enjoy ones great-great-great grandchildren and a probable end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which might be painful but will probably be quick, e.g. car accident
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or something similar).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now the thousands of years concept may be a stretch.  I once did a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculation on the best estimates I could find of loss of brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;neurons and the numbers I got were much less (hundreds of years if I recall).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So unless we get stem cell replacement of neurons on a regular basis all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bets may be off much sooner (so long as one doesn't mention &quot;uploading&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anybody have suggestions on how I could communicate the need for nuance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; diplomacy, and picking one's battles to these well-meaning but slightly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; youngsters? Some example, some object lesson that would resonate with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who overestimate the degree to which the 'normal' world gets the big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A very, very long time ago, I took a course as part of my &quot;enlightenment&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process -- one of the things that stuck in my mind was the statement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;Never destroy someone's belief system unless you are committed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacing it&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Or something to that effect.)  The emphasis is on your personal commitment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to *replacing* the belief system -- a very very hard thing to do -- one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must essentially reprogram a human mind which probably has years of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is a very powerful concept.  People construct their lives around their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beliefs.  Why?  Because their beliefs have allowed them to survive until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current day.  Destroy someones beliefs and you might as well have cast them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adrift in a Class 5 hurricane [5].  So it is relatively important to present
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas in a way that is compatible with pre-existing belief systems.  As new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas become more commonplace (consider for example the impact the Matrix
</em><br>
<em>&gt;series will have on society) then the older ideas will be discarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(witness gay bishops being elected by the Anglican church for example).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[I'm not stating that the Matrix led to the election of a gay bishop --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are separate vectors -- I'm simply commenting on how beliefs can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and will change over time -- but it is very difficult to &quot;force&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;process.]
