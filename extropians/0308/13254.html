<p>Interesting story. Look again at the institutional ownership of 
<br>
Microsoft.  Bill Gates managed to retain a significant amount, but not 
<br>
MORE SIGNIFICANT than Barclays which, as you probably know, is in fact 
<br>
run by the great-grand-son of a feudal lord who retains the title Lord.
<br>
<p>And Microsoft HARDLY runs the world.  They are rent-payers
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Microsoft Empire was built in less than 25 years.  It started,

</em><br>
<p>Well, this is an interesting take on it.  The original price of QDOS 
<br>
was either 50k or 75k, not sure which.  I understand that the story 
<br>
about how he acquired that money and the contract from IBM, then as now 
<br>
one of the biggest companies on the planet, is interesting and not 
<br>
officially published.
<br>
<p>In any case, I wouldn't call 75k &quot;NO PROPERTY&quot; even today, certainly 
<br>
not 25 years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it also does relatively little for the &quot;military&quot; compared with say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Boeing or Lockheed.
</em><br>
<p>Yes and no.  The military won't use windows because it's too crappy.  
<br>
But this doesn't mean that the Military isn't protecting Bill's 
<br>
interest.  You didn't notice the sudden shift in Microsoft's legal 
<br>
problems during the last two years compared with, say, the previous 10 
<br>
when it was being sued monthly for unfair business practices (and 
<br>
losing).  Now they might be considered the luckiest guys on the block - 
<br>
you can't use Linux for free anymore.  It's like God gave Bill a gift.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same could largely be said for Oracle.
</em><br>
<p>You didn't notice the news about the unreviewed Oracle Contracts for 
<br>
the state of California?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want to take the discussion out of the software realm, one might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at 3M or even GE.
</em><br>
<p>You think that 3M and GE are somehow &quot;outside&quot; of the money nexus?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea that the &quot;rent-collectors&quot; drive things now-a-days is absurd.
</em><br>
<p>That you can point to a handful of billionaires that have shifted in 
<br>
some small way the power-structure in the short-run (Dell, Gateway, 
<br>
Microsoft, Oracle, Seibel) the long-money still controls just about 
<br>
everything.  Just because Bill Gates doesn't pay rent every month 
<br>
doesn't mean that the rest of us don't.  So that would be ONLY 
<br>
99.9999999% of people pay roughly half their money to rent-collectors.  
<br>
Is that your point?
<br>
<p>In any case, obviously you didn't look at the institutional ownership 
<br>
list.  Here it is again for future reference.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt">http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt</a>
<br>
<p>Not very nicely formatted, but useful information.
<br>
<p>The BANKS that own upwards of 40% of every company on the S&amp;P 500 and 
<br>
control more than 70% are the rent collectors - they own both the 
<br>
companies, the underlying land, and the means of acquiring capital.  
<br>
They are protected by our government VERY WELL, better than the people 
<br>
are!  If you want to continue the metaphor to feudal times, the feudal 
<br>
lords had several kinds of knights - the warriors, the management and 
<br>
the tax collectors.  For the disney version, check out Robin Hood.
<br>
<p>Since the advent of global capitalization (not to say Global Capital), 
<br>
the value of the management/banking people has increased, but the 
<br>
underlying threat of violence is still there, and nowadays not so 
<br>
veiled, cf. the thread on Incarceration rates in the US.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
