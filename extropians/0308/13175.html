<p>
It might be deep contemplation Damien, but in my case it's
<br>
just plain fatigue after 6 days of interstate conferences and 
<br>
sorting  through the accumulated email aftermath. 
<br>
<p>Russell Evermore was right, 6 days away from a net
<br>
connection can leave one feeling sort of disabled. Time for
<br>
even this small t technophile to invest in net enabled laptop.
<br>
I reckon I should be able to pick up a serviceable unit for
<br>
around Aus$1500. 
<br>
<p>Interesting things biotech conferences. The AusBiotech 2003
<br>
one I just attended in Adelaide is Australia's equivalent to
<br>
Bio (in the US) but scaled. Emphasis is on networking,
<br>
and the business side of biotech, but nano is sneaking in.
<br>
<p>In these &quot;mainstream&quot; industry conferences the assumptions
<br>
about 8 - 12 years to run drugs through clinical trials and
<br>
that IP regimes will not be changing radically or quickly seem
<br>
to be almost universally assumed. 
<br>
<p>I wonder why there is such a wide difference between the 
<br>
rates of change expected by scientists and commercialisers
<br>
in forums like the one I just attended and the folks on this
<br>
list many of whom I also know are well informed about 
<br>
multiple areas of technology?
<br>
<p>I think there are perhaps two reasons. First, the &quot;mainstream&quot;
<br>
although deeper in their areas of knowledge are conservative
<br>
in their public statements to others outside their areas of 
<br>
expertise (but these expectations of relatively slow change 
<br>
can and quite probably will if not challenged become self
<br>
fulfilling prophecies) and the second, is that, imo, the average 
<br>
extrope/transhumanist list frequenter is perhaps more
<br>
appreciative of the possible synergies between technologies
<br>
such as biotech, infotech (including AI) and nanotech, perhaps
<br>
because some are not working in particular knowledge silos as
<br>
specialists, yet on the other hand by not being in the specialist
<br>
silos many may also underestimate how hard it is to accelerate
<br>
the changes in the areas of law (IP, legislation, contractual deal
<br>
making) and politics. 
<br>
<p>Expectations of the rate of change built into planning schemes
<br>
by scientists, government planners, venture capitalists etc
<br>
all go towards imposing something of an upper speed limit
<br>
as well as a lower speed limit. I think there is truth in the notion 
<br>
that it is difficult to hold off an idea whose time has come but
<br>
it also seems true that that idea or memeset can be substantially
<br>
held back as well at least for a time. 
<br>
<p>Poor old Ben Franklin if I recall correctly mused about the 
<br>
possibility of preserving people (himself included presumably)
<br>
in pickle barrels. Now there was a bright guy. How easy it is
<br>
for time (centuries and generations to flit past) and for even the
<br>
brightest and sometimes most lively flames amongst us to be 
<br>
snuffed out. Poor Yorrick.
<br>
<p>The conference did feature some real sexy stuff by a materials
<br>
physicist from the Max Planck institute in Stuttgart Germany
<br>
showing (his computer modelling) on how nanotubes should
<br>
be able to be used to load dna molecules and then transform 
<br>
them electrostatically. The nanotubes themselves are altered
<br>
by a charge in various places and the dna apparently just 
<br>
screws itself in. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett

<p><p><em>&gt; Once again, almost total silence falls upon the list. So far today I've
