<em>&gt; &gt; This is really quite a hate piece, against me personally and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can't seem to figure out from the web pages - is this article

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to be an exclusively web based publication, though it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behave much like any other British tabloid journalist rag in hating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody on the upswing, and doing their best to drag them back down in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the muck. Note that their mascot is the vulture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The Register is a well respected and irreverent hardcore technology and 
<br>
politics internet publication.  However, it has a pretty large readership. 
<br>
It's articles are often quoted and referenced in online blogs.  I would not 
<br>
be surprised if this article gets some exposure in online blogs such as 
<br>
metafilter or plastic. From there a couple of print outlets may pick up this 
<br>
article. 
<br>
<p>The vicious tone of the article will prevent it from being picked up by more 
<br>
mainstream publications. 
<br>
<p>However, given the mediagenicity of this terrorism market story, as evidenced 
<br>
by the degree of exposure we have seen for it recently, combined with 
<br>
the &quot;sexy&quot; tie-in to extropianism and cryonics (Hanson is signed up) I would 
<br>
expect that one or more major print outlets will soon do a followup, and 
<br>
cleaned up, article based on tying together the terror market and 
<br>
extropianism and cryonics.  Triple threat mediagenicity, there.  Batten down 
<br>
the hatches, etc.
<br>
<p>I must say that some of the earlier media exposure and websites published by 
<br>
the extropians leave them (and us cryos) wide open for articles like the 
<br>
Register piece.  For example, the handshake referenced in the article, plus 
<br>
the &quot;Best do it so&quot; stuff.  Talk about exposing your flank....
