<p>
It seems clear to me that as a civilization advances and increases its
<br>
available computing power a larger and larger portion of that available
<br>
power is used in simulation. Simulation of physics, of environments, of
<br>
creatures and yes of detailed and functional creatures in environments.
<br>
Creatures such as ourselves?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As computer power increases over time so too must the frequency and
<br>
capability of those simulations. Given a simple statistical evaluation
<br>
of the process it is nearly inescapable that we must in fact be resident
<br>
in such a simulation (even if it is not detectable as such to us). In
<br>
fact these simulated creatures must so substantially outweigh any &quot;real&quot;
<br>
creatures that most often any thinking and introspective being is most
<br>
likely in such a simulation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Such a simulation would explain many aspects of the questions discussed
<br>
on this list. Why are there no visiting aliens? why they're not present
<br>
in our simulation....etc etc etc
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The real question becomes then if one is resident in a simulation how to
<br>
&quot;discover&quot; this fact? how to communicate with the &quot;runner&quot; of the
<br>
simulation (which may in fact be many levels deep as a sufficiently
<br>
detailed simulation would in fact run their own simulations) and what
<br>
benefit may be derived from doing so? (it may in fact be futile and best
<br>
ignored. Shall we then behave and believe that we are in fact real?)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Ultimately this may be a futile question with no answer but it may in
<br>
fact be the only question worth answering. Python had it wrong...the
<br>
earth isn't a massive computer designed to answer some obscure
<br>
question...the whole universe is...
