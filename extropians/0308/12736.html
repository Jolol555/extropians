</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>C'mon, if you think that any CEOs are going to the cellar
<br>
to be shot, or marched up to guillotines, then you are
<br>
too far from reality.  Even if you are right about overpaid
<br>
top executives, then the worst that will happen is that
<br>
they'll be replaced by cheaper and more effective CEOs from
<br>
within the ranks, as the fad of outside celebrity wears off.

<p><em>&gt; [Mitch writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As Americans become unemployed or take burger flipper jobs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the tax base shrinks. Money for things like defense will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also shrink, money for investment in new technology will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indeed shrivel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### No, it's exactly the opposite. Money which would otherwise be spent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overpaying some employees can be divided between cheaper but better foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers, local consumers who will benefit from lower prices, and researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherever they can be found. Research output will skyrocket.
</em><br>
<p>I urge everyone to carefully attend to Rafal's *economic* arguments.
<br>
So far in perusing this thread, he appears to be the only one up
<br>
on free-market economics, who understands thoroughly why protectionism
<br>
always hurts everyone in the long run.
<br>
<p>Right here, even the US is not really hurt by sending jobs
<br>
oversees where they can be done more cheaply and efficiently
<br>
because the American consumer is then so much better off.
<br>
<p>The only bad thing that can happen is for the lazy Americans
<br>
---who *refuse* to take jobs at lower pay or at *whatever*
<br>
the market will offer---will be abetted by all the stupid
<br>
and awful unemployment &quot;insurance&quot; socialist schemes to 
<br>
weaken the U.S.  No one should ever receive *any* incentive
<br>
to remain unemployed, if what you want is the good of a
<br>
particular nation, or, if what you want is the good of the
<br>
whole world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the money for the so-called &quot;defense&quot; shrinks, it's good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US machine for killing people is too big already.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, let's hear your tune if an A-bomb goes off in Newark
<br>
tomorrow.  I guessed at what many other people's reaction
<br>
would be, but I didn't think to guess yours.  My guess is
<br>
that you would have an immediate and 180-degree attitude
<br>
change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As some Americans become unemployed, the  prices of services, homes, goods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will drop, allowing others, the working people, to benefit, and encouraging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more economic activity, finally allowing the unemployed back into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy. If they want to.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This scenario may not happen if the political forces of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the American middle class react to deprive the corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goons, under whose guidance has led to such wondrous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; developments as Enron hiding loses in fake companies,
</em><br>
<p>Hey Mitch, they got caught, didn't they??  The American
<br>
economy---unlike European ones---is doing just fine.  Look
<br>
at the GNP and unemployment rate.  I think you and far too
<br>
many other people want the make-believe of the late nineties
<br>
back, where everybody was employed on projects that were
<br>
eventually canceled and everyone thought that they were 
<br>
getting rich in the markets.  Real life is not like that.
<br>
*This* is normal---and not so bad, so long as you are not
<br>
having to make difficult life decisions about what to do
<br>
next to help (i.e., you are unemployed yourself).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Consider that an America reduced to a third-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; status,
</em><br>
<p>The only way that will happen is if the lazy socialist
<br>
Americans fail to get off their butts and take work at
<br>
whatever the market prices dictate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; by moving nearly all industry and service off-shore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (despite rabid, empty promises of the creation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; replacement jobs) is not something that most Americans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I believe, will tolerate. Darwinian natural selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a choice with humans, not destiny.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yeah, let's select against other humans - the brown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in who-cares-where, let them eat ... who cares what.
</em><br>
<p>Look, the patriotic part of me doesn't give nearly the
<br>
preference to all those non-Americans.  *I* think that
<br>
protectionism *hurts* Americans.  We are sacrificing a
<br>
lot of productive labor in other countries that could
<br>
be turning out a lot of goods that could make The Superpower
<br>
even greater and save humanity from nuclear proliferation.
<br>
That's the reason (the patriotic part of me that's left says)
<br>
we should always do as the market instructs.  By maximizing
<br>
wealth for ourselves, it so happens that we maximize wealth
<br>
for others.  I really have nothing against that!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We won't tolerate them working for a pittance, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can starve even cheaper.
</em><br>
<p>Your point is well-taken; but our off-loading jobs
<br>
is not to rescue anyone but ourselves.  Still, it
<br>
does expose the inconsistency of the left who
<br>
oppose NAFTA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We'll keep all industry and service here, won't let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ragheads and chinks take it away, right? And if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they get feisty, we'll send the Marines.
</em><br>
<p>No, we should send in the Marines only when someone
<br>
tries to get out of line with weaponry or repression,
<br>
and sometimes not even then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rafal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS. I guess I shouldn't be so derisive and emotional. Sorry, I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; xenophobia and tribalism too revolting. Better I'll just shut up
</em><br>
<p>Oh, please don't do that!  :-)   Even if I am xenophobic
<br>
and tribalistic, your economic contributions are so keen
<br>
and precious.  And even your angry sarcasm does not 
<br>
descend to name-calling or anything.
