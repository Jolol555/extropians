<em>&gt; ### I think I already had this discussion before on this list, with Eugen

<em>&gt; Leitl and you, but maybe we talked only about action transparency, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about thought transparency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All the arguments I have in favor of action transparency are valid for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought transparency. Basically, it's too good for economic efficiency to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in the long run rejected. I believe that whether you/I/we want it or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, sooner or later there will be a fully transparent society (assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's technologically possible), and it will out-think, out-produce and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out-fight all competition. This has little to do with extropy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enlightenment, tolerance, and could be a total dystopia, but our opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this possibility will not change much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe you can take your projected long run advantages for granted 
<br>
for the reasons stated.  In the foreseeable run of events, given current 
<br>
human individual and organizational realities, it is far more likely that 
<br>
major oppression of all that is outside what is currently accepted or 
<br>
currently in power would ensue.  This would lead to a radical lack of 
<br>
innovation and a stagnation of production values.    To get around this I 
<br>
think you will need to come up with a lot more compelling arguments about how 
<br>
the innovative and new that disagrees with current ruling thought and 
<br>
practice has room to develop and come to sufficient fruition for the system 
<br>
to change and grow.    
<br>
<p>I don't see where this would lead to economic sufficiency any more than the 
<br>
group mindedness of various socialized economies led to greater efficiency.  
<br>
How would the lack of private thought and deed improve the picture precisely?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most likely though it will not be so bad. Read &quot;The Truth Machine&quot; by James
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Halperin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That is not a fully thought transparent society and, of course, it is fiction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can accept it now, and think about improving one's chances of long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival based on this assumption, or reject it. I choose the former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach. Future will tell which one is correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Is your decision then arbitrary?  Because you don't seem to be fully 
<br>
presenting your reasons for it.  Nor do you seem interested in showing how it 
<br>
will not lead to dystopia.   How is this responsible?
