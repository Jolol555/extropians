Perusing through an astronomy magazine I came across this article
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----------------
<br>
<p>Time not quantized -
<br>
<a href="http://www.astronomy.com/Content/Dynamic/Articles/000/000/001/219fcvov.a">http://www.astronomy.com/Content/Dynamic/Articles/000/000/001/219fcvov.a</a>
<br>
sp
<br>
<p>&quot;...observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have shaken the idea that
<br>
time is quantized&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;If time is quantized like the energy of photons, there should be a
<br>
certain minimum measurable quanta of time, called a &quot;Planck time&quot; (named
<br>
after German physicist Max Planck, who originated the idea of quanta).
<br>
This also means that life, like a movie, may appear to be a continuum of
<br>
unfolding events but is really nothing more then a series of snapshots
<br>
that together define the past and future.  One consequence of quantized
<br>
time is that the speed of light should not be measurable with a
<br>
precision better than one unit of Planck time, because time becomes
<br>
undefined or &quot;blurry&quot; at smaller intervals. If light is quantized, it
<br>
might have minute speed differences that we cannot measure. &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;If photons emitted from a source at the same instant have tiny speed
<br>
differences, the light waves will arrive at Earth with different phases.
<br>
Over short distances, these discrepancies aren't noticeable...Over large
<br>
distances, though, differences in the light become apparent&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Astronomers Richard Lieu and Lloyd Hillman at the University of Alabama
<br>
in Huntsville used this idea to look for speed distribution in light
<br>
from galaxies billions of light-years away that were imaged by the
<br>
Hubble Space Telescope. If all photons are traveling from the galaxy at
<br>
the exact same speed then all the light waves will arrive in phase. When
<br>
they pass through a telescope's aperture, they interact with each other
<br>
to create a pattern of bright and dark rings &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;However, if the speeds are even the tiniest bit off, the light is not
<br>
in phase. These light waves align chaotically, and no pattern is formed.
<br>
Lieu and Hillman suspected that slight differences in the speed of
<br>
individual photons would cause their light waves to get out of sync over
<br>
great distances, preventing the Airy disk from forming. Much to their
<br>
surprise, the light was all in phase and an Airy disk appeared, implying
<br>
that time is not quantized&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------
<br>
<p>I found this quite surprising.  Surprising, first of all, that time
<br>
might not be quantized, since space, energy, momentum all are.  This
<br>
also has some implications to the last long identity debate I took part
<br>
in.  In that debate, I asked if time was quantized in sync, in other
<br>
words, as all energy progressed through time, was it ALL simultaneously
<br>
created and destroyed, or did each sub atomic particle or quanta have
<br>
its own Planck time ruler.  The implications are important, in the
<br>
former, the entire universe is created and destroyed at every instant of
<br>
time to the next, which would mean to me, no big deal if you teleport me
<br>
in a plank length of time.  In the latter case, at any given instant of
<br>
time, that vast majority of the universe is a continuation from the
<br>
instant before, in which case by my definitions identity is preserved
<br>
through time, and teleportation would not constitute a continuation of
<br>
consciousness.  
<br>
<p>I also asked the question of the space-time quantization was an absolute
<br>
smallest scale of any part of the universe's existence, or if it was
<br>
merely the limit the laws of physics imposed on our observational
<br>
abilities.  This article implies that the latter is the case.  That even
<br>
though we can not measure any smaller than the plank length (or time)
<br>
that it non-theless exists, as in this experiment it would have
<br>
permitted small discrepancies in the speed of light, and caused the
<br>
light traveling great distance to be out of phase, and thus not cause
<br>
definitive interference patterns.  
<br>
<p>However, the existence of the interference patterns can imply 1) time is
<br>
not quantized OR 2) that small discrepancies can not arise in the speed
<br>
of the photons.  This article is written in a manner that assumes 2 to
<br>
NOT be the case, and thus suggests that 1 is.  Is this the generally
<br>
accepted view in physics?
<br>
<p>Additionally, the existence of interference patterns could have still
<br>
occurred if time was quantized, but space-time did not actually exist in
<br>
any increments smaller than the plank length / time, thus making it
<br>
impossible for there to be speed variations.  This researcher /article
<br>
obviously implies that time exists in intervals smaller, since it would
<br>
have direct measurable consequences.  My next question would be, is this
<br>
established in the quantization of energy and space?  Are there any
<br>
observational consequences of energy space existing in intervals smaller
<br>
than the plank intervals, and have these tests been conducted?
<br>
<p>More to the point, if this article is correct, and these results are
<br>
found to be valid, then time is not quantized, and thus teleportation
<br>
could never considered to be anything other than a destructive copying
<br>
mechanism, and by my definitions will always result in there being no
<br>
continuation of consciousness.
<br>
<p>In short, I was right, ppbbbbb!  =)
