<p>
I mentioned the other day that the anchor on a classy Aussie news program
<br>
(SBS news) bizarrely confused astronomical and astrological in her
<br>
announcement of the then-impending Mars-Earth opposition. Last night was
<br>
much worse. 
<br>
<p>After some touchy-feely shots of kids and parents swarming over telescopes
<br>
in local parks, and a talking head astronomer saying yes it was awfully
<br>
exciting but no, actually we won't learn anything until the probes arrive
<br>
in December and January, they cut to a lengthy assessment of the import of
<br>
it all by an actual dyed-in-the-wool astrologer, who told us that Mars was
<br>
traditionally the god of war, so this explained all the recent strife, but
<br>
luckily once the planets had pulled apart from their fatal proximity we
<br>
could anticipate a new epoch of peace and tranquility. 
<br>
<p>This was not presented as comic relief; no, folks, this is pluralist
<br>
respect for different opinions in action. (There was a lot of reiteration
<br>
of how Mars was now `five times closer than usual', which must have made
<br>
people think it was hovering right overhead, perhaps ready to crash into
<br>
us, rather than 67 million km away. (In fact, it's only 30% closer than the
<br>
average opposition.) No faintest notion of scale, none of the elementary
<br>
fact that the two planets come into opposition every couple of years, none
<br>
of the insignificant difference in gravitation effect in being this little
<br>
bit closer. 
<br>
<p>I was deeply hurt that they didn't also include a snippet with a
<br>
spokesperson from the Flat Mars Society (there must be one somewhere).
