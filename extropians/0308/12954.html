Alex Bokov:
<br>
&lt;&lt;...and as for this list being mutual admiration society, as a matter of 
<br>
fact
<br>
I do admire the people on this list. Including Mike and Samantha... except
<br>
when they're aiming vicious little barbs at each other with the rest of us in
<br>
the middle. With the world so full of petty, snide, cynical, mean-spirited
<br>
nonsense perhaps a little mutual admiration is exactly what we need here.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I wasn't really refering to that particular clash. But there have been digs 
<br>
that seem perversely immature and petty. On top of that I feel that the 
<br>
admiration, you refer to, is sometimes seen to be just ego-feeding. Everyone needs a 
<br>
pat now and then, but the buttering up sometimes seems egregious. I can 
<br>
overlook that if the list content is pleasing, otherwise. But, again, cliqishness , 
<br>
or ego-feeding (all part of a mutual admiration society, is disconcerting at 
<br>
best. There are important topics, and being induced to conform to ego-rites is 
<br>
not good for the psyche.
