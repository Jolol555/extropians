APOLOGY:
<br>
<p>This post, which I initially thought I could keep relatively short, soon
<br>
began to get way out of hand, both in terms of my time and in terms of what
<br>
most people want to read on an email list. I think I need to put it on a web
<br>
page where people can access it if they're interested.
<br>
<p>I'll post only the beginning of my analysis of the Patriot Act here.
<br>
<p>I have pasted in quite a bit of code language below. Codes of law, like
<br>
legal contracts, are meant to be applied in an uncertain future. Therefore,
<br>
they attempt to cover as many contingencies as the drafters can foresee.
<br>
If've often wished one could use mathematical notation when drafting legal
<br>
documents; but since it's customary to use the written form of the spoken
<br>
language, one must make do. To make matters worse, the final bill is a cut
<br>
and paste job representing compromises necessary to get it passed by both
<br>
the Senate and House. The result can be pretty nearly incomprehensible, and
<br>
often NO one understands what the heck the thing means, not even the members
<br>
of Congress who voted on it; so the courts interpret it as best they can.

</em><br>
<p>I'll throw in my observation here as well. When a person uses vague terms
<br>
such as &quot;wholesale denial of fundamental rights&quot; I don't usually pay much
<br>
attention to what they've written. I would be much more interested in which
<br>
fundamental rights of which poeple are being denied, who is denying them,
<br>
how they're being denied and so forth. I think one reason people start
<br>
shouting and foaming at the mouth over politics is that they've got their
<br>
brains set in Emotional Mode reather than Thinking Mode.
<br>
<p>To put the PA's in perspective here, this is not the first time the U.S.
<br>
Congress has felt it necessary to curtail certain freedoms in order to
<br>
preserve others. In fact, the first time this happened was back in 1798. The
<br>
Sedition Act of that year says in part:
<br>
<p>==========================
<br>
I Be it enacted . . ., That if any persons shall unlawfully combine or
<br>
conspire together, with intent to oppose any measure or measures of the
<br>
government of the United States, which are or shall be directed by proper
<br>
authority, or to impede the operation of any law of the United States, or to
<br>
intimidate or prevent any person holding a place or office in or under the
<br>
government of the United States, from undertaking, performing or executing
<br>
his trust or duty; and if any person or persons, with intent as aforesaid,
<br>
shall counsel, advise or attempt to procure any insurrection, riot. unlawful
<br>
assembly, or combination, whether such conspiracy, threatening, counsel,
<br>
advice, or attempt shall have the proposed effect or not, he or they shall
<br>
be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor, and on conviction, before any court
<br>
of the United States having jurisdiction thereof, shall be punished by a
<br>
fine not exceeding five thousand dollars, and by imprisonment during a term
<br>
not less than six months nor exceeding five years; and further, at the
<br>
discretion of the court may be holden to find sureties for his good
<br>
behaviour in such sum, and for such time, as the said court may direct
<br>
=======================
<br>
<p>Okay, now let's look at the law known as &quot;Uniting and Strengthening America
<br>
by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
<br>
Act&quot;  aka the USA Patriot Act (signed into law by President Bush in late
<br>
October, 2001).
<br>
<p>The specific sections that concern me are:
<br>
<p>106, which expands the circumstances under which the president may issue
<br>
Executive Orders to confiscate the property of non-US citizens, by amending
<br>
Section 1702 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (Title 50,
<br>
Chapter 35 of the US Code) [I think such a provision may well be useful in
<br>
combating terrorism, but I would like to see more involvement by the courts
<br>
here. As written, I think this provision will harm foreign trade. An example
<br>
of what can happen was recently reported in the NYT. An importer of oreintal
<br>
rugs had already paid for a shipment from China, and the shipment was
<br>
enroute when that State Department published the following notice in the May
<br>
23 Federal Register:
<br>
<p>==================
<br>
SUMMARY: The U.S. Government has determined that a foreign entity has
<br>
engaged in missile technology proliferation activities that require the
<br>
imposition of measures pursuant to Executive Order 12938 of November 14,
<br>
1994, as amended by Executive Order 13094 of July 28, 1998.
<br>
<p>EFFECTIVE DATE: May 9, 2003.
<br>
================
<br>
<p>As this is not considered a &quot;taking&quot; by the U.S. government, the U.S.
<br>
importer will not be compensated and has simply lost the $100,000 he paid
<br>
for the rugs, as they were required to be destroyed by U.S. customs agents.
<br>
Note that these particular executive orders were issued under prior law, not
<br>
the PA.
<br>
<p>50 USC 1702 as amended by the PA, now reads (in part) like this (portions
<br>
added by the PA are in [bracekts]:
<br>
<p>=======================
<br>
Sec. 1702. - Presidential authorities
<br>
<p>(a) In general
<br>
<p>(1)
<br>
<p>At the times and to the extent specified in section 1701 of this title, the
<br>
President may, under such regulations as he may prescribe, by means of
<br>
instructions, licenses, or otherwise -
<br>
<p>(A)
<br>
<p>investigate, regulate, or prohibit -
<br>
<p>(i)
<br>
<p>any transactions in foreign exchange,
<br>
<p>(ii)
<br>
<p>transfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or to any banking
<br>
institution, to the extent that such transfers or payments involve any
<br>
interest of any foreign country or a national thereof,
<br>
<p>(iii)
<br>
<p>the importing or exporting of currency or securities,
<br>
<p>[by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction
<br>
of the United States];
<br>
<p>(B)
<br>
<p>investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct
<br>
and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding,
<br>
withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or
<br>
exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege
<br>
with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any
<br>
foreign country or a national thereof has any interest by any person, or
<br>
with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United
<br>
States; and.
<br>
<p>(C)
<br>
<p>[when the United States is engaged in armed hostilities or has been attacked
<br>
by a foreign country or foreign nationals, confiscate any property, subject
<br>
to the jurisdiction of the United States, of any foreign person, foreign
<br>
organization, or foreign country that he determines has planned, authorized,
<br>
aided, or engaged in such hostilities or attacks against the United States;
<br>
and all right, title, and interest in any property so confiscated shall
<br>
vest, when, as, and upon the terms directed by the President, in such agency
<br>
or person as the President may designate from time to time, and upon such
<br>
terms and conditions as the President may prescribe, such interest or
<br>
property shall be held, used, administered, liquidated, sold, or otherwise
<br>
dealt with in the interest of and for the benefit of the United States, and
<br>
such designated agency or person may perform any and all acts incident to
<br>
the accomplishment or furtherance of these purposes.]
<br>
<p>============================
<br>
<p>The language in 50 USC 1702 (a) (1) (C) give the president the right not
<br>
merely to regulate or block transactions but to seize assets for the benefit
<br>
of the U.S. As long as this provision can be applied only to non-U.S.
<br>
citizens, it only has the potential to damage citizens that are engaged in
<br>
foreign trade or who wish to transfer money or assets out of the country.
<br>
This is somewhat disturbing in itself to someone like me, married to a
<br>
non-U.S. citizen. What's even more disturbing to me, though, is the general
<br>
direction we seem to be headed.
<br>
<p>If one could be 100% sure that such provisions would be used ONLY against
<br>
bad guys, I'd say fine, go for it. But people make mistakes, both innocent
<br>
and not so innocent. Even basically good people are often corrupted when
<br>
they're given too much power (I've seen it happen over and over during the
<br>
16 years I've been a CPA/lawyer).
<br>
<p>I'M GOING TO END HERE, SO AS NOT TO TRY THE PATIENCE OF OTHER LIST MEMBERS
<br>
WHO MAY NOT SHARE MY FASCINATION WITH LEGAL CODES.
<br>
<p>Barbara
