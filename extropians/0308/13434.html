From:  Robbie Lindauer
<br>
<p><p>...What do you think &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; means from below?
<br>
The pretty pictures you see on TV of nice lights lighting up the desert 
<br>
sky are really, every one of them, horrifying, evil and atrocious acts 
<br>
of murder...
<br>
<p><p>Not necessarily, Robbie.  The actual causalty count from that
<br>
initial bombing was remarkably light.  The midnight guided
<br>
bomb attack was targeted mostly on empty buildings and 
<br>
artillery batteries.  The Iraqi commanders (many of whom 
<br>
were sympathetic to the US) had enough sense to order 
<br>
their men away from those targets they knew would be 
<br>
destroyed.  There were a number of U.S. sympathizers or 
<br>
Saddam haters on the ground in Baghdad with cells phones 
<br>
and GPS, guiding the shots and reporting the outcomes.  
<br>
<p>Of course, Saddam and his crew placed the SAMs and 
<br>
artillery among civilian population centers and
<br>
used Soviet GPS jammers to try to turn the bombing into
<br>
horrifying evil atrocious acts of murder, but the
<br>
sophisticated guided weapons still found their marks. 
<br>
<p>The real horrifying evil and atrocious acts of
<br>
murder are yet before us: the Muslim world seems
<br>
bent on a civil war of utter self destruction, as 
<br>
demonstrated by yesterday's assassination of the 
<br>
Shiite cleric al Hakkim.  Over 100 innocents murdered 
<br>
as collateral damage, just to get this one guy.  
<br>
<p>Watch in the next few weeks.  I fear we will see a 
<br>
murderous tit-for-tat in the middle east, one holy 
<br>
site after another blown to bits, a clear expression of 
<br>
homicidal Muslim self-hatred.
