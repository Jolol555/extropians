</em><br>
<p>The ability of such things to be broken down in the stomach has not
<br>
been explored, no, but the place where their breakdown is attempted
<br>
and fails is the lysosome, which is a lot more acidic than the rest
<br>
of the cell (albeit not as acidic as the stomach).  The specificity
<br>
problem sounds ominous, but in fact not: the reason bioremediation
<br>
is so successful is that wherever there is a high abundance in the
<br>
soil of something that's organic and energy-rich, micro-organisms
<br>
find a way to live off it -- the evolutionary pressure to do so is
<br>
strong, because if you're a slow-growing species you need something
<br>
that the faster ones lack.  That's why you can find bacteria at the
<br>
roadside that can eat tyre rubber, for instance.  So, graveyards are
<br>
quite likely to have microbes that can break down recalcitrant human
<br>
remains (except bone, of course, because bone isn't energy-rich.)
<br>
And then, of course, the specificity problem applies to the microbe
<br>
too -- it has to be impervious to its own enzymes.  Of course there
<br>
will be times when something that's non-toxic to its host is still
<br>
toxic to us, but then we just keep looking for other enzymes.  There
<br>
is also unlikely to be a pH problem with fungi, because they have an
<br>
equivalent of the lysosome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One might have to resort instead to &quot;directed evolution&quot; of the type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Maxygen does to get enzymes with the desired specificity.  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finally one might just have to do the enzyme tweeking &quot;by hand&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was done to several of the DNA polymerases to get them to function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more effectively in sequencing applications.
</em><br>
<p>Both agreed, especially for baterial enzymes where the pH optimum is
<br>
likely to need changing.  But one still needs to find the promising
<br>
enzyme to begin with -- and that's where the genomes can speed things
<br>
up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think one may need to devote more attention to what lipofuscin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really is (perhaps to the extent that they have studied what amyloid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is) before one can effectively begin to take it apart.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but maybe we'll find that evolution has given us the solution
<br>
without our needing to know how it did it.  Same as for Chlamydomonas
<br>
nuclear-coded mitochondrial proteins that are mt-coded in animals.
