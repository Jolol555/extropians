<em>&gt; Of course, as prices go up, economically viable

<em>&gt; sources

</em><br>
<em>&gt; nattering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nabobs of negativity.  A hydrocarbon shortage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not stop economic growth, it would stimulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the U.S. and much of Europe, manufacturing is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outsourced to cheaper places, and now we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outsourcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software as quickly as we can write specifications.
</em><br>
<p>Which reminds me of another point.  Synthetic oil is,
<br>
what, less than ten times as expensive as the real
<br>
thing?  Even if all the natural oil were to go
<br>
away...
<br>
<p>Yeah, true, oil would then become a &quot;secondary energy
<br>
medium&quot; like hydrogen.  But some of the oil
<br>
manufacturing processes do involve primary capture of
<br>
energy, using natural solar technology
<br>
(photosynthesis); therefore, this would essentially be
<br>
a spur to wider-spread deployment of solar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we had an industry which creates wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be outsourced, such as blanketing the west with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar cells, windmills and the infrastructure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribute all that free clean power, the economy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be stimulated to the verge of orgasm.  
</em><br>
<p>Probably easier to start by blanketing the cities,
<br>
western or otherwise.  Not as much need for
<br>
infrastructure until you've tapped out that vein.
<br>
<p>Though, keep in mind that the actual blanketing can be
<br>
outsourced: cells can be manufactured overseas and
<br>
installed by imported labor.  But once it's
<br>
installed...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To state that wind power cannot replace hydrocarbon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burning is simply absurd.  We really can do it all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renewables: wind, water and sun.  Sure it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot of costly infrastructure, but that is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beauty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of capitalism: it gets things done.  Right now, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our capital is idle, doing nothing but bidding up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the prices of each other's homes to absurd levels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as those seen in the Sillyclone Valley.  Let's cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense and build something!
</em><br>
<p>I resemble that remark.  You don't happen to be
<br>
running for governor, do you?  ^_^;
<br>
<p>(I wonder if someone will seriously suggest this to
<br>
one of the leading candidates.  Fund it by tax credits
<br>
towards the installation of solar: most of the money
<br>
would come out of the energy companies' pockets, in
<br>
the form of lowered utility bills if nothing else,
<br>
and/or out of those we'd export solar cells to.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only thing holding this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world back is that there is still way too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil, coal and gas in the ground that needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be burned up.
</em><br>
<p>Too much *cheaply accessible* oil, coal, and gas, thus
<br>
driving the cost of energy down.  But, yeah.  (Irony:
<br>
I was just discussing with a friend his fictional
<br>
alt-verse where the Tesla Generator actually worked,
<br>
producing essentially unlimited super-cheap
<br>
electricity starting just before 1900.)
