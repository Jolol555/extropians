<p>Yes, observationally they're the same to outside observers.
<br>
And perhaps yes, my complaint may come down to the tense
<br>
of sentences people use to describe black holes.  But even
<br>
if that's all it is, then people have still said a lot of
<br>
very incorrect things, or, (of course) I do not understand
<br>
what is going on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the singularity is not necessary to have a black hole, e.g. some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum gravity theories propose...
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes.  In fact, Scientific American just had an article about
<br>
that.  But here I am talking about the GR theory itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Event horizons appear naturally even in classical physics if you view 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them as the effect of superluminal escape velocities.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't know that superluminal velocities were a part of
<br>
mainstream theories at all.  Yes, for sure, event horizons
<br>
appear even in very ordinary physics.  You can outrun a
<br>
photon if you start about a light year in front, and maintain
<br>
about a 1 gee acceleration.  It never catches you, even though
<br>
you do not yourself (of course) ever quite get to lightspeed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even in GR there are no &quot;real&quot; objects but rather the spacetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypersurfaces with limit light rays.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so I am told.  And it does make sense that event horizons
<br>
capture outgoing photons (and, as I contend, incoming ones too!).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Schwarzschild solution is rather inescapable for any spherically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symmetric static object, and perturbations don't seem to alter the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential characteristics. Do you disagree with GR altogether, or assume 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that some other effect causes the interior to behave wildly different (a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; la the baby universe example above or some weird force preventing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collapse)?
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm following standard GR so far as I understand it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/bh_pub_faq.html#evaporate">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/bh_pub_faq.html#evaporate</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (seems a bit too popular to me. Maybe the best way of finding out is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply to make a model of a classical black hole with a slowly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decreasing mass and follow where the geodesics go)
</em><br>
<p>Well, I read that FAQ many years ago in John Baez's stuff.  But thanks
<br>
for directing me to it again.  There are many passages in it that 
<br>
almost but (to me) do not quite address my problem.  Consider the
<br>
paragraph in section 5 that reads
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the black hole is mortal, you'll instead see those events
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[infalling astronaut] happen closer and closer to the time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the black hole evaporates. Extrapolating, you would calculate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my time of passage through the event horizon as the exact
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment the hole disappears!
<br>
<p>Note the use of the word calculate.  Often in the FAQ, the author
<br>
insists that we consider only the *appearance* of the black hole---
<br>
namely the photons that are reaching us from the events taking
<br>
(or which have taken) place near the event horizon.  He calls
<br>
this merely an &quot;optical effect&quot;, and I too am completely uninterested
<br>
in merely what we see.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Of course, even if you could see me, the image would be drowned
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out by all the radiation from the evaporating hole.) I won't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience that cataclysm myself, though; I'll be through the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizon, leaving only my light behind. As far as I'm concerned,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my grisly fate is unaffected by the evaporation. 
<br>
<p>So here it is said, unmistakably, that even though the hole is
<br>
only mortal, the infalling astronaut breezes through the event
<br>
horizon before that occurs.  Yet if a tiny mirror (supported by
<br>
very powerful rockets) is suspended just above the event horizon,
<br>
and the hole is not going to evaporate before, say, 10^1000 years,
<br>
then you may calculate that if the mirror is close enough, then
<br>
a photon we emit may take 10^300 years to get to the mirror, and
<br>
10^300 years to get back (in our reference frame, a round trip
<br>
time of 2x10^300 years).  So my confusion stems from the fact 
<br>
that if we send a photon into the black hole just ahead of the
<br>
astronaut, then in *some* sense by our watch it strikes the
<br>
mirror only after a long time.  The astronaut therefore does
<br>
not pass the mirror and does not go through the horizon also
<br>
until a *very* long time, that is, as we reckon it, not before
<br>
10^300 years.  (Naturally, his watch is nearly frozen, and to
<br>
him it's no time at all.)  The trajectories of the infalling
<br>
and outgoing photons are identical according to what I read.
<br>
<p>There are many puzzles such as I have just outlined.  I don't
<br>
see an answer to them.  Any help is appreciated.
