</em><br>
<p>I can't cite a Google source, but the best book I've ever seen on the topic
<br>
is *How to Grow More Vegetables* by John Jeavons. It contains comprehensive
<br>
charts with information on calorie yield per square foot, not only for
<br>
vegetables but also for grains and fruit and nut trees. The yields are given
<br>
for poor medium and high quality soils, so one can get an idea of what one
<br>
can produce the first year, and in subsequent years after one has had a
<br>
chance to build up the soil.
<br>
<p>While many of the horticultural methods discussed in the book are excellent,
<br>
I find some of the &quot;biodynamic&quot; stuff silly, but the charts alone are well
<br>
worth the price of the book.

<p><em>&gt; I think one thing missing in the discussion is what happens in various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regional areas as we concentrate the houses in ever-expanding (cheaper?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suburbs while concentrating the jobs in core centers.  An ever increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of time and money must go into transporting oneself from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far flung suburbs to the core centers.  I knew people that would spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one or two hours (each way) commuting from the North Bay to the South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bay.  Seattle is rapidly becoming similar.
</em><br>
<p>Three things local governments could do to move real estate development the
<br>
other direction would be to give tax incentives for inner city development,
<br>
impose higher taxes on parking lots and parking garages, and stop building
<br>
more freeways. The main reason for suburan development seems to be
<br>
economics -- at the moment, it's cheaper for the individual to live outside
<br>
the city and drive in than to live inside the city. Whether it's *actually*
<br>
cheaper if you include the externalized costs is another question, and I
<br>
don't know the answer.
<br>
<p>Individuals and developers could, of course, reclaim inner city areas on
<br>
their own with no government incentives at all; and many people (including
<br>
Damien and me) are doing that.
