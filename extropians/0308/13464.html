<p>Right, because you'd have to get involved in a detailed analysis of a 
<br>
very difficult to defend position.
<br>
<p>Just the facts - Did we drop bombs on civilians in Iraq and Afganistan? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did we HAVE TO?  Is it okay to drop bombs on people if we don't HAVE 
<br>
TO?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'll simply note that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're post is a classic example of pomo focus on &quot;text&quot;
</em><br>
<p>So now I'm a &quot;pomo, unoriginal, contentious, opponents of the law, 
<br>
obstructionist, un-informed, un-happy, half-hearted, minority, 
<br>
un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
<br>
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; pomo ideas is correct.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for actually asking.  No, I'm a naive realist - all there are 
<br>
are the facts, nothing but the facts, all of them objective and 
<br>
objectively knowable and provably so.
<br>
<p>But I am aware that controlling dialogue with value-laden terms is an 
<br>
effective rhetorical method used consistently by the right wing to 
<br>
control the context of dialogues.  This is why such conversations tend 
<br>
to drift quickly into how unoriginal, contentious, uninformed, unhappy, 
<br>
half-hearted, uncivil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
<br>
left-leaning and liberal anyone who doesn't believe everything they 
<br>
hear on Fox News or Ayn Rand said is.
<br>
<p>When confronted with someone who's aware of this technique an attempt 
<br>
to abort the dialogue usually ensues immediately after the 
<br>
name-calling.  You were good, you name-called and made the attempted 
<br>
abortion.  Good work.
<br>
<p>I'm happy to abort too if we can agree on the factual points I made in 
<br>
my original post to which you found it important enough to respond:
<br>
<p>1)  We dropped bombs on civilians in alarming numbers, killing upwards 
<br>
of 6,000 Iraqi Civilians and an as-yet unknown number of military 
<br>
personnel.  I don't have the numbers on Afghanistan handy, but I 
<br>
believe them to be as significant and we can bring out the FACTS of the 
<br>
matter on this too.
<br>
<p>2)  It's wrong to kill people needlessly.
<br>
<p>3)  We didn't HAVE to go to war in Iraq, no one forced our arms, we did 
<br>
it &quot;pre-emptively&quot; to use the official language for the action which 
<br>
means &quot;we went because some subset of 'we' wanted to&quot;.
<br>
<p>4)  That subset is profiting immensely from the current action both 
<br>
immediately in terms of military and military-related expenditures and 
<br>
long-term in terms of higher national debt and resulting future 
<br>
taxation increases.  Haliburton's expected revenues from the Iraqi war 
<br>
is upwards of 1.6 Billion.  Cheney still takes approximately $1M/year 
<br>
from Haliburton as a &quot;CEO Emeritus&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd also have to work very hard to keep from being drawn into an insult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; match;
</em><br>
<p>That's what I've been trying to avoid by just pointing out what you 
<br>
SAID.  Those are your &quot;rhetorical&quot; words up there, not mine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I checked out your ISP and found that it was promoting Chomsky, Jim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hightower and Michael Moore.
</em><br>
<p>My ISP?  Check the whois on it.  If you want to see REALLY uncivil 
<br>
conversations, check out the forums there!
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.thetip.org/forum.php">http://www.thetip.org/forum.php</a>
<br>
<p>don't only read Ferguson and Keynes, that's a very limiting perspective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm afraid we're so far apart that the effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to remain civil is wasted.  Why don't we just agree to disagree and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at that?
</em><br>
<p>I guess I just can't let the factual parts go.  I'm willing to ignore 
<br>
the name-calling.  But if extropianism is &quot;Pro-life&quot; in the 
<br>
non-abortion sense, then isn't it against needless killing?  Then isn't 
<br>
it essentially against hawkish, imperialistic foreign policies?  
<br>
Doesn't the PNAC describe itself in precisely these terms?
<br>
<p>Still genuinely not trying to get into a name-calling match.
<br>
<p>Robbie
