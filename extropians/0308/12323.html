And here's another view, from physicist/gadfly Robert Park; the interesting
<br>
part is his throwaway line about why futures markets work when they do:
<br>
<p>&quot;What's New&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:opa@aps.org?Subject=Re:%20Poindexter%20to%20Quit%20Pentagon%20Post">opa@aps.org</a>&gt;

<br>
<p>WHAT'S NEW   Robert L. Park   Friday, 1 Aug 03   Washington, DC
<br>
<p><p>1. THE POINDEXTER FILE: WOULD ANYONE CARE TO BET ON HIS FUTURE? 
<br>
An $8M Pentagon plan to set up a futures market in Middle Eastern
<br>
developments was hastily scrapped when it was met with derision
<br>
and revulsion.  Called the Policy Analysis Market, the plan was
<br>
to base intelligence judgements on betting patterns.  Uh fellas,
<br>
the alleged predictive value of futures activity is merely a sign
<br>
of illegal insider trading.  Anyway, the person in charge of this
<br>
fiasco, Adm. John Poindexter, has already been banished.  That's
<br>
good, but here's an insider trading tip: John Poindexter has been
<br>
banished before.  National Security Advisor to President Reagan
<br>
(WN 6 Dec 85), Poindexter devised a &quot;disinformation&quot; plan to
<br>
mislead Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi (WN 3 Oct 86).  There's no
<br>
indication that Gadhafi was misled, but American newspapers were. 
<br>
Then, the infamous &quot;Poindexter Memorandum&quot; sought to extend
<br>
government control over unclassified private databases (WN 14 Nov
<br>
86).  A central figure in the Iran-contra scandal, his conviction
<br>
for lying to Congress was later set aside on the grounds that
<br>
immunized testimony had been used against him.  He disappeared
<br>
from public view for several years, only to reappear with Bush II
<br>
as head of the DARPA office responsible for Total Information
<br>
Awareness (WN 20 Dec 02).  Yesterday it was announced that
<br>
Poindexter is leaving the Pentagon   we hope for good.
