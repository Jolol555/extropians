Hubba Hubba Honda Honda 
<br>
<p>By Brad Edmonds 
<br>
<p>[Posted August 21, 2003] 
<br>
<p>That title is from a Car and Driver article of the mid-1980s, about the results
<br>
of the editors' putting two engines into a little Honda CRX. The Hubbas are even
<br>
more fitting today, as Honda keeps building the best cars in the world, forcing
<br>
other automakers to work hard to keep up. Some are having more success than
<br>
others. How does Honda do it? 
<br>
<p>In Honda's case, as with any corporation, much of what the consumer sees comes
<br>
from the top. Soichiro Honda, the founder, was a daring, hard-headed, friendly
<br>
entrepreneur and engineer. He thwarted the good-ol'-boy Japanese business
<br>
environment of the mid-20th century by working around government discouragement
<br>
and restrictions, ignoring social and business pressure, and making his little
<br>
machines. He began by manufacturing piston rings, moved to motorcycle engines,
<br>
then motorcycles, and then he took on the auto industry. 
<br>
<p>Since he wasn't one of the good ol' boy corporations, he had to accept less
<br>
promising college and trade school graduates as employees. Soichiro attended
<br>
engineering school, but didn't bother taking tests or attending classes he
<br>
didn't want; he was already too busy attending to his new business. He told his
<br>
new employees he had faith in them, and if they didn't like the way he did
<br>
business, they could leave. This was exceptional—traditionally, Japanese
<br>
employers viewed new hires as lifetime vassals. 
<br>
<p>Soichiro put customers first, and he adapted quickly to customer input. He
<br>
introduced his motorcycles to the American market in 1959. The bikes quickly
<br>
developed a reputation for unreliability—they couldn't handle the hard paces
<br>
through which Americans put them. So Mr. Honda immediately improved his engines,
<br>
and by 1963 Honda was the best-selling motorcycle in the US. In 1960 he decided
<br>
to build cars, and within 5 years of that decision a Honda won the Mexican Grand
<br>
Prix. 
<br>
<p>The company continues to damn the torpedoes. When the American government went
<br>
(more) protectionist against Japanese imports in the 1980s, Honda, along with
<br>
other foreign manufacturers, built plants in the US. Today, a Honda Accord's
<br>
&quot;domestic content&quot; for us is 97%, which makes the Accord less of an import than
<br>
the Ford F-150. 
<br>
<p>The Marysville, Ohio plant that builds Accords is worth mentioning. Considered
<br>
the most efficient auto plant in the world, it is where the Honda people bring
<br>
young Japanese managers to show them how a plant should work. (Note that the
<br>
Marysville workers decided to go nonunion when the plant opened.)  Today, the
<br>
Japanese continue to outstrip American automakers in auto quality, performance,
<br>
and manufacturing efficiency. 
<br>
<p>The big three American automakers habitually beg the government for protection,
<br>
and the Japanese just put on softer gloves and keep beating us up. Are Japanese
<br>
government subsidies a competitive advantage?  The Americans get subsidies, too.
<br>
As to whether the Japanese restrict American cars entering Japan:  Heck, suppose
<br>
the Japanese allowed no American cars at all on their shores. Should that make
<br>
us build inferior vehicles? 
<br>
<p>Here's part of the answer:  An American, Edwards Deming, developed approaches to
<br>
measuring and improving quality and efficiency in manufacturing in the 1950s.
<br>
Deming was ignored by American manufacturers at the time, but the Japanese
<br>
embraced him and his ideas, and later named their national manufacturing prize
<br>
for him. From following Deming's advice, Japanese cars are the best in the world
<br>
for the money (my high-strung S2000, street legal but built to be raced in
<br>
amateur meets, needs its first full tune-up at 105,000 miles). 
<br>
<p>Many Japanese cars are now better than even German cars. Just as one example,
<br>
the rear-drive Infiniti G35 is a four-door sedan that competes directly with the
<br>
BMW 5 series in interior space, amenities, and performance. The G35 can be had
<br>
fully equipped for about $33,000, the engine is good for 260 hp and 260 lb-ft of
<br>
torque, and the interior is the same size as the BMW's. The BMW 530i develops
<br>
225 hp and 214 lb-ft while it weighs 100 pounds more than the Infiniti, and the
<br>
BMW starts at $8,000 more. 
<br>
<p>I would assume everything Honda manufactures (ATVs, engines for riding lawn
<br>
mowers, generators, motorcycles, outboard motors, personal watercraft, pumps,
<br>
scooters, and snow blowers) lives up to the same quality, reliability,
<br>
affordability, and style standards as their cars. Honda continues its record of
<br>
successful adaptation to external constraints and demands by leading the
<br>
industry in developing government-mandated alternative fuel vehicles. Their
<br>
Insight hatchback is the only consumer gas/electric hybrid vehicle you've
<br>
probably already seen on the street (the one with the rear-wheel skirts). 
<br>
<p>Americans invented many of the biggest ideas—Henry Ford made automobiles
<br>
affordable; Deming showed the way to continuing quality and efficiency
<br>
improvements; our marketers probably did much more than the Japanese to develop
<br>
the customer responsiveness the Japanese have mastered; and we invented SUVs,
<br>
pickups, and minivans. Engineering isn't the only issue, either:  Style matters
<br>
to car buyers, so some of the more expensive Japanese brands have hired American
<br>
designers in California to make their cars look so good inside and out. 
<br>
<p>We invent great ideas, and the Japanese—Honda in particular—adopt them and put
<br>
them to work. We should have the advantage in the auto industry, but our
<br>
automakers want profits without sweat. Hey, it's easier to get the government to
<br>
hurt the competition. One example:  In the 1980s, we passed a $2000 tariff on
<br>
Japanese minivans. Our automakers immediately raised our prices by $2000. It's
<br>
too bad for us that our corporations would rather stiff us than learn from their
<br>
own great ideas. Until they change their habits, get yourself a Honda.
