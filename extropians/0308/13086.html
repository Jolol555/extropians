</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Exactly--and I know with acceptable probability that I have no interest
<br>
in, and will derive no value from, what those *people* have to say.
<br>
<p>The way I don't have the time or the inclination to listen to the
<br>
pitch of every panhandler on my block on the way home from work (I
<br>
live on Haight in SF, so this is a considerable number of individuals),
<br>
I also have neither the time or the inclination to read the arrogance
<br>
and vitriol of certain members of ANY group forum like this extro list.
<br>
We all have to deal with a copious volume of personal communication.
<br>
Some of it is of value, some is not.
<br>
<p>I'm not typically one for breathless technofetishism, but blessed be
<br>
the killfile.  It's a monstrously powerful and wonderful tool.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know about your individual eagerness to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who were determined enough to subscribe to a transhumanist email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, I wonder how much patience you will have with people who never  heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this meme complex before. From my point of view you (plural: all people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with killfiles) already fail at this very first step of a specific email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, where people meet to talk about future development and how to realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
But actively spreading the meme complex isn't everyone's agenda (in fact,
<br>
by your own statement, it isn't even yours).  I'm here because it exposes
<br>
me to a lot of interesting developments in science and technology, because
<br>
I hope to live in a time where we see dramatic human life extension,
<br>
because I believe that humans should have the right to the access,
<br>
modification and extension of their own bodies, minds, genetic codes.
<br>
<p>I don't assume that everyone in the world does, should or will share
<br>
these opinions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The very existence of killfiles and the very choice of this word might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken as an insult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
As an insult to whom?
