<p><em>&gt; My poetical image of 'sitting in a rocking chair on the porch'

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Older people who do not have to worry about income (because they have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good pension or are wealthy) and already have much experience of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world are not as 'driven' as the young turks. Some are old crocks, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many play golf, tour the world, take drugs (prescribed - of course!), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. Age, experience and relative wealth does change your outlook on life.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeed experience does change your outlook on life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The European nations are just beginning to grapple with the problems of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an aging population, because the young folk don't want kids anymore. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do have children, they only have one, which is not enough to stop 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the aging population problem.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution takes into account all &quot;bad&quot; decisions.  People
<br>
such as the present non-Moslem Europeans will simply be
<br>
demographically replaced by people who do decide to have
<br>
children. In North America the native population was
<br>
replaced by the immigrants because the immigrants could
<br>
and did support more children.  The tribes failed to grow
<br>
exponentially because they did not have the resources to.
<br>
<p>It is definitely *not* the case that in some obscure fashion
<br>
the Indian tribes choose not to have as many children, for it
<br>
would take only one (1) tribe to happen by chance upon a
<br>
different philosophy and numerically take over the continent!
<br>
The *only* reason that this did not happen was that their
<br>
manner of lifestyle did not support such population growth.
<br>
<p>In the very same way, some of our descendents will choose to
<br>
proliferate, and some will not.  Those who choose (or can)
<br>
proliferate will predominate.  You can't get away from this
<br>
tautological fact.
<br>
