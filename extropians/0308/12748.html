<em>&gt; &gt; The only bad thing that can happen is for the lazy Americans

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the market will offer---will be abetted by all the stupid

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weaken the U.S.  No one should ever receive *any* incentive
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular nation, or, if what you want is the good of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Working&quot; per se should not be our goal. Instead, getting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximum wage per hour worked should be the goal.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  So long as it's *WORK* and not welfare/unemployment.
<br>
And your country will be best off if the people want to work,
<br>
and at whatever wages they can get.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imagine if I applied for a job at bakery, and the employer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offers me $10/hr, and I counter with an offer of $5/hr, saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that since I buy bread, I will benefit from the lower prices!
</em><br>
<p>Please try harder to be sensible.  I am old and cantankerous
<br>
and am interested only in serious progress towards the truth.
<br>
No one in your silly scenario has any incentive to say what
<br>
he did.
<br>
<p>If you do study the process of wealth creation, I maintain,
<br>
then you'll see that if under-developed countries send us
<br>
scads of goods at low prices, then this *must* be wealth
<br>
producing for us if our people are flexible.  This means
<br>
flipping burgers for a while, if necessary, but continuing,
<br>
*as always* to look out for the best opportunity.
<br>
<p>One thing that would help in the U.S. is to have less 
<br>
government regulation, so that hiring and firing were
<br>
easier, and no one had to worry about Big Brother
<br>
looking over their shoulder.  It would help also if
<br>
the character of the American people was more resilient,
<br>
and they weren't so damned obsessed with *security*.
<br>
<p>Security should come from one's savings and from one's
<br>
relatives, not from stupid anti-production guarantees
<br>
from one's employer.  It would mean than fewer people
<br>
would get fired.  Like in 1830, the boss might come in
<br>
one day and say, &quot;You are not working out. Either leave
<br>
or take a $15 per hour pay cut.&quot;  Presumably the boss
<br>
also goes over to the next worker and says, &quot;you *are*
<br>
working out here, I don't want to lose you, here is a
<br>
$10 pay hike&quot;.
<br>
<p>Wouldn't *my* scenario be what you would expect in
<br>
a Darwinian economy?  Do you *really* understand how
<br>
competition makes my scenario plausible?  And can you
<br>
think of a more productive, wealth-creating environment?
