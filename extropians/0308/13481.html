<p><p>Well, ok, but I've been here long enough to know we almost never talk about 
<br>
human augmentation.  We talk occassionally about a lot of far out things like 
<br>
uploading, running dups, whether we are in a Sim, SAI and FAI but very little 
<br>
about IA.   Not to pick a nit,  I'm just a bit curious as to why.  
<br>
<p>On this other matter one thing we MUST learn in the process of IA is how to 
<br>
talk with each other without dissovling into name-calling and such.   If we 
<br>
aren't in part about learning it here where we have some more focused reasons 
<br>
to do so then where?
