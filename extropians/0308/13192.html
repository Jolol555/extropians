<p>Minimum wage is below subsistence levels for families with children.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We expect more now, so it should

</em><br>
<p>Actually, we expect less.  For instance, it seems perfectly reasonable 
<br>
for people to pay 200-600k for a CONDO in West LA/Santa Monica.
<br>
<p>Now, if you're a decent earner (90k-150k) that'll take you 
<br>
approximately 30-years to pay for assuming you spend less than half 
<br>
your earning on your home.
<br>
<p>If you're a &quot;not-quite-so-decent&quot; earner and are in the &quot;average&quot; 
<br>
category, 40-60k, you can't afford to buy a condo in West LA/Santa 
<br>
Monica - EVER.  You can get the same kind of thing in Pasadena or 
<br>
something.
<br>
<p>Now, compare to just 40 years ago - my Grandfather bought his VERY NICE 
<br>
house in Arcadia (kind of an upscale Pasadena at the time and now) for 
<br>
20k (which was A LOT).  He was a &quot;decent&quot; earner for the time and paid 
<br>
for his house inside of 10 years.
<br>
<p>When he sold his house, he pocketed something like (I don't know the 
<br>
exact number) 500k (1990) but obviously couldn't afford to re-buy the 
<br>
same house with the money.  (He's happily retired in La Jolla just in 
<br>
case you were worried about him... 88 years old and still kicking!  A 
<br>
closet transhumanist, he's blind and wants to have his eyes replaced 
<br>
with artificial eyes, but can't because the FDA doesn't approve of the 
<br>
surgery...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Earning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsistence level survival is cheaper and easier now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than ever before, and getting more so all the time.
</em><br>
<p>20 seconds on Google will show this to be false.
<br>
<p>Try starting here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.weingart.org/institute/">http://www.weingart.org/institute/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One needn't even work: standing on a city streetcorner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a &quot;Will Not Work for Anything&quot; sign will get you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the donations needed to survive.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, if you don't mind sleeping in your own urine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...Then, you could pay for a piece of land capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustaining your own family within 7 years by working...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today you can earn enough to support yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a similar manner by working only a few months.
</em><br>
<p>Well it depends on what you do.
<br>
<p>Ebay - Real Estate, 40 acres (remember, 40 acres and a mule) with a 
<br>
house - farmable land.
<br>
<p>Generally well over 150k.  I don't know about you, but earning and 
<br>
KEEPING 150k nowadays is a big deal &quot;for most people&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look around you, Robbie.  Farmland is as cheap as,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, dirt.  It costs practically nothing.
</em><br>
<p>More than 1000/acre generally.  You need about 40 acres to live on, 
<br>
that's 40,000.  I happen to have it, but then I make good money.  
<br>
&quot;MOST&quot; people are negative in the cash arena.
<br>
<p>CF - <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/wop/jopovw/220.html">http://ideas.repec.org/p/wop/jopovw/220.html</a>
<br>
<p>Mostly due to inflation, rising BASIC costs of real estate, 
<br>
consolidation of income at the top 5% of earners, and of course the 
<br>
personal factors - lack of education, foolish spending, etc.
<br>
<p>&quot;Most People&quot; even though empirically are moving backwards in wealth 
<br>
creation still believe that they're saving money.  (If you put 2000 
<br>
into an IRA this year, you think you're saving money, but if you've 
<br>
incurred more than 2000 in debt, you're losing money generally by 9% or 
<br>
more.  &quot;Most People&quot; incurred more than 2000 in debt/negative finance 
<br>
last year.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you need to do is eat, like the &quot;then&quot; people, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is so simple even the hippies managed it, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fashion.
</em><br>
<p>Where'd you pull this one out of?  My parents were &quot;hippies&quot; that lived 
<br>
on a commune for a short time.  Few of those succeeded.  Very, Very few 
<br>
of them made it for more than 10 years.  I doubt you could find more 
<br>
than 100 examples of &quot;American Kibutz's&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there is little need for all that effort.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers will let poor people glean the fields after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a harvest today, and there is *plenty* of discarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothing available for nothing or nearly so, clothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more comfortable, durable, practical and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashionable than anything the &quot;then&quot; people could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have managed.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what makes you think this, but if you go onto the Dole 
<br>
Pineapple farm in Hawaii, they'll shoot you.  And if you go into the 
<br>
Del Monte Tomato farms, they'll have you arrested.  &quot;MOST&quot; farmland 
<br>
that's producing now is owned and operated by major corporations that 
<br>
don't appreciate &quot;gleaning&quot;.  I think you're thinking of the Biblical 
<br>
Law, but that was circa 4000 BC - TIMES HAVE CHANGED.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is plenty of land in the U.S. which cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be farmed *profitably* for various reasons, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is still perfectly farmable for food production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a family scale, as demonstrated by the Amish.
</em><br>
<p>The Amish farm profitably.
<br>
<p><a href="http://personal.bgsu.edu/~nordstr/amishinnov.html">http://personal.bgsu.edu/~nordstr/amishinnov.html</a>
<br>
<p>Again, 20 seconds on google.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This land can be had for a few hundred dollars an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acre, all of it you want.
</em><br>
<p>That's a few THOUSAND dollars/acre for farmable land.  Even Arizona 
<br>
desert land is up around 500/acre.  And you CAN'T farm that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted, it might not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be near any cities or actual roads, but it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; water and good soil, land that the &quot;then&quot; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have gone to war to secure.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;then&quot; people did go to war to secure it.  But ALL of the land with 
<br>
WATER in it now has restrictions on the use of that water.  If you buy 
<br>
land with a stream running through it that currently doesn't have a 
<br>
farm, it's nearly impossible to get a variance to let you start farming 
<br>
it since, with near certainty, someone else downstream is already using 
<br>
that water.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If you don't care for any of the luxuries that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have today, the cars, the electronics, the internet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the medical care, the stuff that the &quot;then&quot; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't have, earning a living has become so simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to be trivial today.  sp
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about you, but I pay $40/month for my home DSL and you can 
<br>
buy a computer now for less than 200, plus another $100 or so for  
<br>
monthly.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, food bills for a family of four are around 
<br>
$2000/month.  By FAR the biggest expenses are Rent/Mortgage and Food.
<br>
<p>Speaking of health care - THEN there was a local doctor who would do 
<br>
house visits for $1 OR LESS.  NOW you can't get a doctor to do house 
<br>
visits and it costs upwards of $100/visit (even the copay IF you have 
<br>
insurance is 10-20).  For those of you who can count, thats 2000x 
<br>
inflation.  You might argue that the medical care is better - which it 
<br>
is if you happen to be among the wealthies 5% of americans - the rest 
<br>
of us are dying at alarming rates from some of the same diseases and 
<br>
injuries that were killing THEM THEN with much worse new ones 
<br>
including, by far, the largest killers - Accidental Death, Malignant 
<br>
Neoplasms and Heart Disease.  CF  - <a href="http://webapp.cdc.gov">http://webapp.cdc.gov</a>
<br>
<p>And while the life expectancy has raised pretty significantly ON 
<br>
AVERAGE, just about nobody lives past 120, and most people still die in 
<br>
their 70s.
<br>
<p>Consider:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4822a1.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4822a1.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Which states that great progress has been made in health since the turn 
<br>
of the century BUT it does it's survey based on coal-mining.  Now, coal 
<br>
mining while dangerous, is no longer as large an industry as it was in 
<br>
1900 and this study, while an interesting study of coal-mining related 
<br>
deaths, is just baloney WITH THAT HEADLINE.   The truth is, as it was 
<br>
then, MOST PEOPLE DIE of accidental deaths, followed by whatever the 
<br>
current flavor of disease is (polio, cancer, etc.)
<br>
<p>And the Extropic point in all of this is that the bottom line is that 
<br>
the death rate continues to be 100%.  Now you can make yourself feel 
<br>
better about having better food (like In-N-Out) and better water 
<br>
(probably false) but making a case for an overall improvement in the 
<br>
quality and length of life is pretty hard when you actually look at the 
<br>
data.
<br>
<p>NOT THAT things can't be potentially better, just that they are MERELY 
<br>
potentially better.
<br>
<p>In any case, happy Saturday MORNING!
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
