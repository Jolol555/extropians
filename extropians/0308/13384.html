<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Randy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;I wonder if one could get some of Richard Florida's ideas about how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;creative class moves in here. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I agree. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Maybe it is because I am an Alcor member, not a CI member.  Maybe I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would be more strident if I felt more directly threatened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;People ride high on negative press and will look between the
<br>
<em>&gt; cracks in hopes of discovering any possible areas in which cryonics has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flaw in its business practices and suspension practices.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, well, looking at the background (and possible motivations) of this 
<br>
fellow Hollister (in charge of the MI govt branch that has shut down CI), we 
<br>
see that he is a former mayor of a city in MI. So, it is probable that he is 
<br>
looking to use this issue to leverage his way to statewide media exposure for 
<br>
himself, thus opening a path to possible statewide political office.  Give 
<br>
him a way to finish this conflict that makes him look good, and he will take 
<br>
it. What that is exactly, it might behoove CI members to determine.  Fight it 
<br>
out in court?  In the media? Portray cryonics as a &quot;belief&quot; which hurts no 
<br>
one and is entitled to freedom to practice from the state? Or accomodate and 
<br>
change CI as he deems?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the cryonics community, we might do best by holding a sense of valued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility.  Maybe not.  This depends on its practices.  If CI does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have bad business and suspension practices, then it would not be wise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support it.  Conversely, if it is reputable it would behove us to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supportive of it in a sense of coopetition.
</em><br>
<p><p>Not only that, but it is my &quot;backup plan.&quot; And a cheap one, too!  It is hard 
<br>
to see how CI is going to come up of this with the same prices......
