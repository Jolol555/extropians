<p>Here's a bit more on the 1798 acts. Few people today would doubt that the
<br>
acts were motivated (at least in part) by domestic politics, although the
<br>
excuse made by the Federalists was that they were needed to protect the U.S.
<br>
against nasty foreigners. Note that the Republicans of that time were more
<br>
similar to the Democrats of today than to present-day Republicans.

<p>======================
<br>
<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/65/al/AlienNSe.html">http://www.bartleby.com/65/al/AlienNSe.html</a>
<br>
<p>1798, four laws enacted by the Federalist-controlled U.S. Congress,
<br>
allegedly in response to the hostile actions of the French Revolutionary
<br>
government on the seas and in the councils of diplomacy (see XYZ Affair),
<br>
but actually designed to destroy Thomas Jefferson’s Republican party, which
<br>
had openly expressed its sympathies for the French Revolutionaries.
<br>
Depending on recent arrivals from Europe for much of their voting strength,
<br>
the Republicans were adversely affected by the Naturalization Act, which
<br>
postponed citizenship, and thus voting privileges, until the completion of
<br>
14 (rather than 5) years of residence, and by the Alien Act and the Alien
<br>
Enemies Act, which gave the President the power to imprison or deport aliens
<br>
suspected of activities posing a threat to the national government.
<br>
President John Adams made no use of the alien acts. Most controversial,
<br>
however, was the Sedition Act, devised to silence Republican criticism of
<br>
the Federalists. Its broad proscription of spoken or written criticism of
<br>
the government, the Congress, or the President virtually nullified the First
<br>
Amendment freedoms of speech and the press. Prominent Jeffersonians, most of
<br>
them journalists, such as John Daly Burk, James T. Callender, Thomas Cooper,
<br>
William Duane (1760–1835), and Matthew Lyon were tried, and some were
<br>
convicted, in sedition proceedings. The Alien and Sedition Acts provoked the
<br>
Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions and did much to unify the Republican party
<br>
and to foster Republican victory in the election of 1800. The
<br>
Republican-controlled Congress repealed the Naturalization Act in 1802; the
<br>
others were allowed to expire (1800–1801).
