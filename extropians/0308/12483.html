<p>
How should a utilitarian live, given Nick Bostrom's Simulation
<br>
Argument? Nick has a paper [1] on how a utilitarian should live. But in
<br>
it, he for some reason completely ignores the simulation argument that
<br>
he himself developed, and implicitly assumes that we are not living in
<br>
a simulation. His main conclusion is: &quot;the lesson for utilitarians is
<br>
[that we should maximize] the probability that colonization will
<br>
eventually occur.&quot;
<br>
<p>On the other hand, we have Robin Hanson's paper [2], titled &quot;How To
<br>
Live In A Simulation&quot;. His conclusions are:
<br>
<p>If you might be living in a simulation then all else equal you should 
<br>
care less about others, live more for today, make your world look more 
<br>
likely to become rich, expect to and try more to participate in pivotal 
<br>
events, be more entertaining and praiseworthy, and keep the famous 
<br>
people around you happier and more interested in you.
<br>
<p>So we have one prominent extropian telling us to live for today, and
<br>
another one telling us to live for the far future. Who is right? It
<br>
occurs to me that we should take a probability-weighted average of the
<br>
two positions. If the simulation argument is correct, there is a tiny
<br>
probability that we live in root reality and what we do today affects
<br>
an astronomical number of potential future individuals (including all
<br>
future simulated individuals), and a near 1 probability that we live in
<br>
a simulation and our actions affect relatively few people. We need to
<br>
take both possibilities into account when making decisions. When we do,
<br>
I think the two positions cancel out somewhat and we can live a more
<br>
&quot;normal&quot; life.
