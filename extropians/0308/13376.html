<em>&gt;&gt; Then you have a world full of cowards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You build a false dichotomy as I already pointed out.  People who have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intention of dying can and do act with considerable bravery and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none the less.
</em><br>
<p>While you may have &quot;no intention of dying&quot; in order to simply maintain 
<br>
your own desired freedoms (I assume you desire these) it's likely to 
<br>
become necessary to defend them.   If you're unwilling to defend them 
<br>
with your own life, you're likely to loose versus an opponent that is 
<br>
(unless you're much, much smarter and better than they at warfare).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are also likely to act a great deal more rationally when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their goal system is not mucked up with some wild notions of bravely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being nearly the most noble thing.
</em><br>
<p>Nobody thinks that dying is great.  The claim is that fighting with 
<br>
abandon to protect core values (family, freedom, etc.) is necessary and 
<br>
good and that if you fight with abandon, you might get killed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you'd like a world in which people come together to jointly improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their world, promote bravery and goodness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can promote &quot;goodness&quot; with great dedication without glorifying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being &quot;brave&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>As a father, I know that if the wrong person came into my house with 
<br>
bad intentions I'd be willing to kill them, it'd be my duty (even 
<br>
though I'd identify myself as a pacifist).  Once you're willing to use 
<br>
deadly force, you have to assume that your opponent will be too.  This 
<br>
is not to glorify dying but just to point out that in certain 
<br>
situations it may be the right thing to do.
<br>
<p>Would you recommend that if someone came into my house and attacked my 
<br>
family that I simply run away?  That would be cowardice.  I may 
<br>
actually be a coward (never having had this happen to me) but I 
<br>
certainly won't say that it'd be good if I was.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
