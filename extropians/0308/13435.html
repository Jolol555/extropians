<p><p>So you believe it is right and reasonable to have a rule of thumb that we will 
<br>
go in and impose our will, because of course we know best, on any supposedly 
<br>
soevereign nation that does anything at any scale that we find offensive?  
<br>
With the one caveat being that the nation we would impose our will upon 
<br>
cannot adequately defend itself against us?    Really?   
<br>
<p>So Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and so on had the right idea - put all 
<br>
the world under one authority?    This supposed right to intervene anywhere 
<br>
and everywhere that you would use today for a human rights violation, what 
<br>
would stop it being used tomorrow to enforce anything at all that the nuclear 
<br>
haves might consider advantageous to them?   On what principles would some 
<br>
things that we know better about be separated out from others as actionable 
<br>
offenses?  
<br>
<p>When the US becomes unlivable for extropic values where will you go where you 
<br>
may carry on your work and your live with less interference?  Will you be of 
<br>
the same opinion when it is you and what you believe in that has the sword of 
<br>
anywhere-anytime force over your head?
