The major problem with this article is that where any actual economic
<br>
thinking is actually going on (as opposed to knee-jerk anti-progress,
<br>
anti-technology, pro-forced-wealth-redistribution thinking that permeates
<br>
this thing), it's all Keynesian. Especially that giving money away business;
<br>
shades of setting the people to work digging holes and filling them again
<br>
because that makes everything better if you believe Keynesian economic
<br>
theories. (Bah). That's not even to start on the candlemaker fallacy part;
<br>
apparently we must stop progress because some industries will suffer. Narry
<br>
a mention of the job creation in new industries, just the same old zero-sum
<br>
protectionist nonsense based on the assumption that people are owed security
<br>
and a livelihood with no effort on their part, funded by the wealthy via
<br>
forced redistribution of wealth. Even the anti-capitalist, anti-free-market
<br>
arguments in this thing are tired and by the numbers, pushing the effects of
<br>
government intervention (no5t labeled as such, of course) in trade and
<br>
markets as reasons for more government intervention. It's sad, sad, sad. And
<br>
stupid. Massively, massively stupid.

<em>&gt; Subject: Robots r Us

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh boy, you folks are going to have a field day with this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marshall Brain has written an article called &quot;Robotic Freedom&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-freedom.htm">http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-freedom.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It outlines the problems that modern economies will have as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robots start to significantly displace individuals in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work force.  (Mind you I don't completely agree with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions/time-frame.)  But this goes back to points that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moravec has made in his books, e.g. &quot;How does the economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function when robots do most of the work?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The interesting suggestion that Brain makes is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government should literally give money away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, question -- does or does not the knowledge of several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyers on the list require &quot;real&quot; artificial intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or could their arguments be presented by a robot with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a &quot;simple&quot; logical argument component with a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory?  (E.g. essentially a legal &quot;expert system&quot;.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As background, I'll simply point out that expert systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that diagnose certain diseases have been built (and IMO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would probably do a much better job than several physicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've encountered over the last year).  This relates to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of precisely *when* do many of the service jobs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go to the robots in addition to the physical labor jobs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (To the lawyers -- no offense -- I'm just trying to fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the debate of &quot;what are robots&quot; and &quot;what are AIs&quot; and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trends may dictate how people should prepare for the future.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
