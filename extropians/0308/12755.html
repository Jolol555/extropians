<p>Here's a crazy idea: make transparency proportional to authority.
<br>
Elected representatives have absolutely no privacy, save for
<br>
bathroom breaks. You don't have to worry about shady deals because
<br>
there's a camera crew following them every second of every day.
<br>
Every person they speak to is the business of the nation; we have a
<br>
right to know *exactly* what they're doing with their power.
<br>
<p>This would make the jobs of senators, ministers and presidents extremely
<br>
unattractive to most people. Only those who have nothing to hide will
<br>
want or be able to do it.
<br>
<p>Two problems:
<br>
<p>a) There's no way in hell the current [1] administration would vote this
<br>
in. Too many skeletons in the cupboard.
<br>
<p>b) Transparency is useless without an attentive media to chase up the
<br>
wrongdoings. [2]
<br>
<p>There are loopholes and edge cases (e.g. secret meetings still need to
<br>
be secret), but the majority of representatives have no legitimate use
<br>
for privacy. If they wanted a private life, they shouldn't have got a
<br>
public job.
<br>
<p>Douglas Adams said it best: &quot;It is a well-known fact that those people
<br>
who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do
<br>
it... anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should
<br>
on no account be allowed to do the job.&quot;
<br>
<p>[1] I'm not talking about the USA; *no* government would
<br>
want this. [3]
<br>
<p>[2] Now I am talking about the USA.
<br>
<p>[3] Kind of kills the whole idea really...
