As an addendum to Damiens excellent post, I just found this in the
<br>
latest PNAS:
<br>
<p><p>PNAS | July 22, 2003 | vol. 100 | no. 15 | 9085-9089
<br>
<p>Resolving the question of color naming universals 
<br>
<p>Paul Kay    and Terry Regier   ¶ 
<br>
<p>The existence of cross-linguistic universals in color naming is
<br>
currently contested.  Early empirical studies, based principally on
<br>
languages of industrialized societies, suggested that all languages may
<br>
draw on a universally shared repertoire of color categories. Recent
<br>
work, in contrast, based on languages from nonindustrialized societies,
<br>
has suggested that color categories may not be universal. No
<br>
comprehensive objective tests have yet been conducted to resolve this
<br>
issue. We conduct such tests on color naming data from languages of both
<br>
industrialized and nonindustrialized societies and show that strong
<br>
universal tendencies in color naming exist across both sorts of
<br>
language. 
<br>
<p><p>Another fun paper in same issue, slightly related:
<br>
<p>Foreign-language experience in infancy: Effects of short-term exposure 
<br>
and social interaction on phonetic learning 
<br>
<p>Patricia K. Kuhl *, Feng-Ming Tsao and Huei-Mei Liu  
<br>
<p><p>Infants acquire language with remarkable speed, although little is known 
<br>
about the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition process. Studies of 
<br>
the phonetic units of language have shown that early in life, infants 
<br>
are capable of discerning differences among the phonetic units of all 
<br>
languages, including native- and foreign-language sounds. Between 6 and 
<br>
12 mo of age, the ability to discriminate foreign-language phonetic 
<br>
units sharply declines. In two studies, we investigate the necessary and 
<br>
sufficient conditions for reversing this decline in foreign-language 
<br>
phonetic perception. In Experiment 1, 9-mo-old American infants were 
<br>
exposed to native Mandarin Chinese speakers in 12 laboratory sessions. A 
<br>
control group also participated in 12 language sessions but heard only 
<br>
English. Subsequent tests of Mandarin speech perception demonstrated 
<br>
that exposure to Mandarin reversed the decline seen in the English 
<br>
control group. In Experiment 2, infants were exposed to the same 
<br>
foreign-language speakers and materials via audiovisual or audio-only 
<br>
recordings. The results demonstrated that exposure to recorded Mandarin, 
<br>
without interpersonal interaction, had no effect. Between 9 and 10 mo of 
<br>
age, infants show phonetic learning from live, but not prerecorded, 
<br>
exposure to a foreign language, suggesting a learning process that does 
<br>
not require long-term listening and is enhanced by social interaction.
