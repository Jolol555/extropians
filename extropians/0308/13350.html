<p><em>&gt;A Note to Director Hollister
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;<a href="http://www.cis.state.mi.us/insidecis/director/note_to_mayor.htm">http://www.cis.state.mi.us/insidecis/director/note_to_mayor.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>I just edited it a little, as you suggested anyone do.  Thanks for giving
<br>
us this template.
<br>
<p>Natasha
<br>
<p><p>Dear Mr. Hollister,  
<br>
<p>I am a cryonicist.  I need to be assured that their services are available
<br>
to me when the time comes.  Your interference with their operations is
<br>
uncalled for, represents ignorance of or indifference to the scientific
<br>
basis and the life-saving intent of the practice, violates the fundamental
<br>
right of each individual to self-defense and to the right to choose one's
<br>
own medical care, and violates both the freedom of religion and the
<br>
separation of church and state.  
<br>
<p>The vast majority of individuals who are signed-up with cryonics 
<br>
organizations are among the most technically and culturally sophisticated
<br>
people in the world.  They see the possibilities the future holds, in stark
<br>
contrast to the rest of the population of the &quot;civilized&quot; world, who are
<br>
almost completely ignorant of even the basics of present day science and
<br>
technology.  
<br>
<p>This is the same science and technology which, since the time of Galileo,
<br>
has struggled to promote truth and rationality against the forces of
<br>
mysticism and prejudice. The same science and technology and truth and
<br>
rationality has given us the very civilization we today celebrate and
<br>
enjoy: unprecedented levels of material abundance, comfort, safety,
<br>
freedom, and, to enjoy it, a healthy lifespan two and a half times greater
<br>
than the brief and brutish span of the jungle from which science has
<br>
lifted us.  Everything we are, everything we have built proclaims that
<br>
science and rationality delivers, mysticism and prejudice destroys.
<br>
<p>The same vast majority of people who consider cryonics to be a sham, due so
<br>
not on the basis of scientific training, but rather on the basis of cultural
<br>
prejudices, superstition (which they call religion), and a slavish
<br>
adherence convention.  Fine for them. This is our protected right, founded
<br>
on this country's tradition of freedom of religion.
<br>
<p>Signee
