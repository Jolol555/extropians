<p>I am worried on how long the large middle class will continue
<br>
to exist in the current 1st world countries.  If the difference
<br>
between rich and poor people (within countries) keeps growing
<br>
like it has over the past decades, a large middle class might
<br>
well become a thing of the past.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, housing + food + healthcare have become so
<br>
horribly expensive that high tech toys are just a drop in the
<br>
bucket in many of the richer country...
