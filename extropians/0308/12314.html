I would have to say that I feel &quot;more safe&quot;.
<br>
For a couple of years prior to 911 I had been concerned that something of
<br>
this magnitude would occur soon. I would say we were due for it, but that is
<br>
only from the viewpoint of an outsider looking in. Now that it has happened,
<br>
it has created an awareness on the part of the Stupids which reduces the
<br>
likelhood of similar events occurring.
<br>
<p>Granted, I can't come up with with a statistical model to show the reduced
<br>
likelyhood, but maybe some kind of fuzzy math occurs in my subconscious
<br>
allowing me to feel a certain &quot;intuition&quot;. Either way, I &quot;feel&quot; safer now
<br>
than before.

<p><p><em>&gt; Of course not; we never have been. Total safety is illusory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the question is &quot;how safe are we&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about a poll...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who on the list personally knows someone affected by terrorism. Personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquaintances as maximum distance, no friends of friends please.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More subjective: would you rate yourself now (hopefully based on some kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of quasi-empirical guestimate, at least) as more or less safe than you
</em><br>
were
<br>
<em>&gt; 10 years ago? 20 years ago? What are the major threats to your continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence/lifestyle? How about 10 years into the future?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just for a bit of extropian perspective, remember that it is still the
</em><br>
case
<br>
<em>&gt; that we all have a death sentence hanging over our heads, and will be
</em><br>
until
<br>
<em>&gt; someone fixes it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; According to a NY Times report today, hundreds of millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of dollars may have been raised for terrorist activities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (either in Palestine or the U.S.)  [1].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To my best recollection the 911 bombing financing was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the neighborhood of $100-200K.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So one has a potential financing ratio of ~1000:1 (i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are 1000 times as much funding out there as what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may have been spent on attacks thus far) -- i.e. about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1000 potential 911s could be currently being financed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Assuming a comparable loss of life in such attacks --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3000 people * 1000 attacks = 3 million people, one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to wonder *just* exactly where must we draw the line?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And terrorists seem to be showing little discrimination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as to precisely *where* they may act.  So the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; becomes for anyone &quot;are you safe anywhere?&quot;.
