<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm very sorry to see Lee leave the list, but I have to count 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as a mistake on Lee's part.  The mistake arises from what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the concept of free speech means in the specific context of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this forum.  
</em><br>
<p>I personally do not think the issue lies primarily with a question of
<br>
free speech.  It's a question of an apparent wanton and arbitrary
<br>
expulsion of someone who happens to present generally unpopular
<br>
political opinions, and more specifically political opinions which
<br>
apparently counter opinions of extropy board members.  In addition, I
<br>
can hardly find it reasonable to suspect that Mr. Lorreys banning had
<br>
nothing to do with calling to task the unproductive and inactive nature
<br>
of members of this mailing list, and official extropy activities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There will be even more disagreement about whether, rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a single post, an overall approach to posting justifies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusion.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Persistent combativeness and lack of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politeness can and should be a factor - an important factor - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in applying the sanction of exclusion in a private, focused 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forum.  Someone whose posts are consistently personalistic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and which generate continuing personal unpleasantness can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stay in a semi-public, semi-private forum forever without the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall tone of the forum being degraded.
</em><br>
<p>Nor can apparently vague, arbitrary, and explusions suspicious of a
<br>
personal vendetta not degrade the overall tone of this mailing list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know there is a core disagreement among some people about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether values of politeness and personal tone should be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factor in list governance.  To those who maintain that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not, I urge you to consider that the packaging of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas IS important and that a community can be and will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judged by the manners it tolerates. 
</em><br>
<p>And it is also judged by the manner in which it tolerates dissenting
<br>
voices.  I find it hard to believe the Mr. Lorrey is the single worst
<br>
perveryor of deragotary implications, personal attacks, or general
<br>
un-productive un-civilized discourse.  I invite any one to view
<br>
Humanias' vitriloic emotional rants of the past few months presented
<br>
against those who supported the War in Iraq.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The very act of enforcing minimal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards of tone and style itself generates unpleasantness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ill-feelings among many.  But this is also a challenge of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom: Real liberty is perforce accompanied by the duty to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize such values, 
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, which is why it would be good to present a reasonable and
<br>
understandable case for Mr. Lorrey's explusions, or else people of
<br>
similar political persuasions or even those who feel they may one day
<br>
not be in good favor with the 'right' people may persistently feel the
<br>
sword of Damaclees is perpetually hanging over their heads by an ever
<br>
thinning thread.  Even in your post justifying his expulsion, we still
<br>
see no clear and reasonable case made about it, just some vague comments
<br>
about maintaining the integrity of the list.  Coupled with Natasha's
<br>
previous comments about 'harmful to the community', some do not feel
<br>
this bodes well for the integrity of discourse on this list or the value
<br>
of continuing to be a member of it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To return to the concept of free speech, I urge subscribers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to consider that ExI is not a government, and the values and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules regarding governmental regulation of speech don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily translate into matters of private list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governance. 
</em><br>
<p>No one is saying you cant do what you want as a private organization,
<br>
but don't expect it to not reflect negatively on the integrity of the
<br>
list.  It is a private forum to be done with by the owners what they
<br>
will, but fortunately unlike governments, we can freely choose to leave.
<br>
I hope extropy does not see a mass emmigration, but given past events I
<br>
cant see how there wont be at least some.
<br>
<p>This is a private forum, not a government, but that doesn't mean we have
<br>
to sit by and not protest the apparent change from an open, progressive,
<br>
and free discussion to one of e-gulags and enemies of the e-states.    
<br>
<p>Of course, if we dissent, much like in oppressive governments, we may
<br>
simply be e-disappeared.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mike Lorrey's exclusion: Ultimately he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is free to post elsewhere, create his own forum, post web pages, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, and some of us have all ready created our own lists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, I urge those who are unhappy to look again at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natasha's post: New organization for our discussions is in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the works and any exclusion from this forum is temporary.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but the precedent has been set.
