SORRY, ctrl-enter apparently sends off the letter,
<br>
and I just hit it by accident  :) so I'll just skip down

to the last point I addressed in the previous message :)

<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I would say that they are; I would say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only reason to willing self-delude yourself via fantasy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever is specifically because you have examined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the outcomes and decided that reality sucked and you could do better.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;I see. You are interchanging fantasy and self-delusion. I
<br>
tend to think of fantasy as suspension of disbelief. One
<br>
knows one is doing it and one is doing it for fun.&lt;/snip&gt;
<br>
<p>=== ... and here we continue ====
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would say that you would end up having to constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (subconsciously)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moniter reality to decide when you would come out of ur protective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Now thats the moral code. The reason for the moral code is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that usually judgements will be required in real life which one cannot
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; anticipate and the better, the more sophisticated your moral code the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, (the more enlightened) your judgement of your own best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; again I balk at the requirement for a sophisticated moral code; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can have an incredibly simple moral code; but apply it through the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; use of a sophisticated world view (ergo ur judgement).
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs scale (the
<br>
simplest) may not do something that is good for society in general but
<br>
for far more basic reasons, than a person who is reasoning at level 5.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or
<br>
abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your code. I would think
<br>
that a person would have a hard time having a complex moral code without
<br>
having the ability to use language for instance.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; &quot;But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or
<br>
abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your code&quot;...
<br>
Exactly my point :) this is what I would term a sophisticated
<br>
world-view.  You understand why things are, and how they're
<br>
stated affects the outcomes...
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Our leaders must make judgements that will have impacts on lives
<br>
other than their own. 
<br>
The more of us that are reasoners and critical thinkers and the fewer of
<br>
us that are mere 
<br>
believers the better (the healthier) we will be as a society in my
<br>
opinion.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; depends :)  there are uses for followers (believers); for instance,
<br>
I would not necessarily
<br>
want to run a committee of reasonerss and critical thinkers :) but I
<br>
would love to chair one
<br>
where there was one or two other reasons, and the rest were followers :)
<br>
I think btw, that
<br>
nature establishes the proportion of leaders to followers...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and I do dispute ur choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hallucinate;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-hypnosis?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; No. I am an open minded sceptic when it comes to
<br>
conventional hypnosis. I have never experienced it
<br>
and those that I have seen ostensibly hypnotised on
<br>
stage seemed to me to be substantially &quot;hamming&quot;
<br>
or playing it up for the attention. I think some of
<br>
us sometimes like not having to be analytical all
<br>
the time and to have others tell us what to do
<br>
and just follow alone can be pleasant.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; trust me, hypnosis is real, and very VERY effective :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can get urself into a deep enough trance, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-hypnotic suggestions that trigger when you wake... including the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post hypnotic suggestion to renew itself until you are rescued.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can cause hallucinations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a deep enough trance btw.  And thats not even calling upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mystics, or people who have sufficiently advanced manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I don't know if I can get into a trance as you put it. I guess I
<br>
can its just not something I am very familiar with.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; you should check it out :) their are some qualitative tests to see
<br>
whether or not you are hypnotizeable to any
<br>
such degree.  It may also be a comfort issue with you :)  There are
<br>
(technically) ways to get around your mental
<br>
blocks... read some material on hypnotic inductions for patients who are
<br>
subconsciously resisting hypnosis :)
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I suppose when it comes to my mind I am a bit of a control
<br>
freak, I don't like it when the captain is not on the bridge.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; depends on what the crew's going to do when ur away :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; I find this conclusion (Bertrand Russell's) powerful, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangerous and deeply unsatisfying so I am keen to have at it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I was just telling my little sister yesterday about one of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classical issues in my life (at one point during my younger years); 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what point does being too intelligent start to harm you (the classic
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; form being, if you could trade intelligence for gauranteed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness, would you do it)... most intelligent people say no; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think the really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent people though, when they consider it, say yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I think this is pure speculation. Would a less intelligent you
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; be you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; does it make a difference if you are gauranteed to be happy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; If you think so there may be possibilites for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to chart a life for yourself that involves more happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and less intellect. But personally I don't think so. How do you aim at
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; happiness without identifying something that will make you happy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Happiness is not itself a thing that can be persued.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ergo my point :) if you can't gaurantee happiness by method of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, and some mythical blue genie (whom to the best of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities to discern is capable of granting) is willing to gaurantee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ur happiness at the cost of your intelligence than any sane, rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person of sufficient intellect would not think twice.  This assumes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that everyone wants to be happy[maiximized utility table]... which I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think is an unreasonable...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt;I must be failing to follow what you mean by maximizing your
<br>
utility table of something because it still seems to me that happiness
<br>
cannot really be a target that one aims at it is a consequence that
<br>
arise as a desired and hoped for side effect of something else one aims
<br>
at.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; theoretically [NOT physically] everyone has an internal weight to
<br>
stimuli;  maximizing ur utility table means successfully selecting an
<br>
action
<br>
from all available actions that maximizes ur utility for that set of
<br>
actions... ergo happiness :) ergo all ur actions are incidental as they
<br>
are all
<br>
targeted towards maximizing ur utility table :)
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt;There is a saying &quot;man is the only animal that laughs
<br>
and weeps, because he is the only animal that sees
<br>
what is, and what might have been&quot;.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; ... &quot;or do you want to be the winner who goes home and fucks the
<br>
prom queen?&quot;
<br>
I don't believe in regret as an emotion :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course, assumes that people intuitively seek to maximize their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; utilities, and said maximization of utility defines a state of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness [which is, I think, reasonable]...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I don't I think its premature at best and problematic at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst. One cannot be happy without a cause. Happiness per se is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuable. Pleasure is. Lesser levels of sentience are. But I doubt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are what appeal to you as an alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; take a look at a little kid sometime :)
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Hey I grew up in a catholic family - I've seen the old
<br>
kid of two :-)
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I reckon they are very active little hypothesis testers
<br>
and experimenters. Just because we may look in from
<br>
the outside an think they are &quot;playing&quot; doesn't change
<br>
that they are playing at something. If they are happy
<br>
playing they probably declared they were going out
<br>
to play (something specific) rather than going out to
<br>
be happy.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; if laughter/smiling is a consistent symptom of happiness,
<br>
little kids (who are loved) generally have it in spades...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Ah I think you missed my point. The potential to persuade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the sociability aspect *is* far stronger when individuals are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerless and my point is that the all those who are mortal are now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming &gt; *aware* that they possess a poor form of wealth and power
</em><br>
if it can't extend 
<br>
<em>&gt; their life and health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ... and these are the only people you're interested in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaching?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Yeah only all those who are *mortal*  and have a self-interest
<br>
;-)
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I was referring to the wealth and power aspect :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; There is an opportunity there to get them to revisit the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social compact. But these cagey old survivers will not fall for bs. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When arguments are put to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are not in their interest they will not buy into them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; its been my experience that people who are very wealthy  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally don't  give a shit about social compact.  They got (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  preserve) their wealth at the cost of other individuals...  I would  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that you need to put it in terms that involve greed.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Well self interest will do.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; in most cases, it will; in some cases (where the agents lack
<br>
vision), it doesn't :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; So in my view a moral argument cannot be put to a rich or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful individual unless it is couched in terms of offering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *something* for them. We live in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historic period. In this  period it might be possible to promote a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy of more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life for all or more life for none.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; good luck getting the rich to give a shit about the poor (past 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones  making off with their valuables)....
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; No I'd aim to get the rich to care more effectively for the rich
<br>
by recognizing their relationship with the poor. My emphasis is not be
<br>
charitable to the poor my emphasis is on how would you life be better if
<br>
the poor were not so poor? If they had more to loose. If they were able
<br>
to cooperate with you to make both you and them wealthier in absolute
<br>
terms rather than relative terms.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; if they acknowledge a relationship with the poor... 
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Would you rather be healthy and active at 130 or have a
<br>
very expensive funeral and a prestigiously looking burinal
<br>
plot at 80?
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; the former :)  I (personally) am not arguing with ur goal :)
<br>
I just think rich people won't see it ur way (as a win-win solution).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The alternative may be cabals of the powerful working to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'immortalise' themselves. Such a scenario may restart &quot;history&quot; whose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demise was greatly exaggerated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; probably :) I hope to be part of a successful cabal :) but only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if quality of life is high...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Beware the dark side Luke :-)
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; more like Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine :) &lt;GRIN&gt; ;)
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; on a serious note though, I would not be part of a cabal
<br>
that sought to hold back life-extending technologies... I think
<br>
all medical advances should be shared equally, without regard
<br>
to effort involved (or contributed) by individual parties.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Further those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who do not know endeavour to understand themselves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what manner of creature they are, are not going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a position to know what the most optimal compromises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for them are when compromises need to be made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I've met several people who are extremely intuitively, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to verbalize (form coherent sentences) expressing their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewpoints...they just know what is right for them, and what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how does your system encompass them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; They learn to reason and they learn to use language to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They learn to understand what they want. This gives them the best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance to make their way and improve their situation as they go. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not guarantee them success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;omd&gt; and if the overall performance of this new system ends up being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse than their intuitive model? what then?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I have no magic. If my moral code is adopted by others it will
<br>
because they see merit in it. If they see merit in it and I see merit in
<br>
it I'm prepared to work on the assumption that their is merit in it. -
<br>
That a bit simplistic but this thread is very long.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; in other words, you are willing to accept a less than perfect moral
<br>
system :) for the sake of efficiency...
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; my only concern, really, is to point out that you may be
<br>
arbitrarily limiting yourself :) and wouldn't it suck
<br>
if it took an intuitive person to find the solution amidst all the
<br>
noise...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The universe in which hard work  gurantees success is not this
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; one in my view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;omd&gt; work smarter, not harder has always been my motto...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Makes sense. But leveraging your efforts with others can be a
<br>
particularly effective way of working smart.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I would agree with that :) can be effective :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I would have been happy to point out to the unibomber that he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was born social, so much so that he couldn't raise his head to feed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; granted :) but that doesn't really nullify the fact that he did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become extremely antisocial afterwards...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Granted. But there is value in knowing why and how. The value is
<br>
in the power to identify route causes that can be changed. Lets go for
<br>
the disease not the symptom.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; assuming that it is a disease, and that it is a root cause to be
<br>
attacked...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Then I'd ask him where his sociability ended. It could be an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insightful conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; probably when he realized it was a losing game for his utility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tables...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Or he may discover that he's been shortchanging his own self
<br>
interest with a suboptimal utility table.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; ... if he was shortchaning his own self-interest :)  we can keep
<br>
going in circles if you like :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some are quite capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of going it alone while others would die if seperated from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; herd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; None are capable of going it alone yet. But here is the point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the future we may re-engineer ourselves to such an extent that some
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; may indeed feel capable of going it alone. And these indivduals will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily be able to be reasoned with with the same starting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premises. These individuals may become meglomanical persuing as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culmination of their individuality dominance over all else. Because, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you have no empathy - why the hell not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; why not indeed?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; And therein lies the danger of the future. Rugged immortal
<br>
individualists fighting for supreme godhood in the universe.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; at least it would be entertaining :)
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; By why not? Seriously. I dunno but I figure god would be bored
<br>
(and lonely) well perhaps not lonely.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I don't particularly believe in God :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Everyone is social to a degree. Am I really saying that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is reachable through their residual sociability. I doubt it. I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature throws up dysfunctional types of all forms and some genuine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociopaths can probably only be dealt with as amoral threats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; watch some interviews with a sociopath :)  they're really quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascinating...  anyways, there's no reason to render a sociopath a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat; in fact, I'ld say they can be harnassed to detect flaws in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current modes.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Perhaps I'm saying sociopath when I mean pyschopath.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; they're both used interchangeably :) the explicit difference
<br>
is between antisocial and socio/psychopathic...  The best guy (in
<br>
my opinion was Clark)... Brilliant on this topic :)
<br>
<p><p>&lt;brett&gt; Bail at any time or edit with more extreme prejudice. The offer
<br>
was there in the last post.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Quite seriously, long rambly dialogs are probably
<br>
better offlist. I think it was worth having the discussion
<br>
but maybe not on list.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Any illuson I had that others might read much of this
<br>
have long past. But the upside is that the dialectic
<br>
process does help sort out thoughts. In this thread
<br>
somewhere are a few gems. They may be distilled
<br>
at a later date maybe.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; offlist, onlist, makes no difference to me :) I don't
<br>
think the cost of email (for the listserv) necessitates taking
<br>
it offlist unless somebody specifically requests it :)  besides
<br>
onlist, its archived, and somebody might throw in a comment
<br>
on a specific section :)
<br>
<p>omard-out
