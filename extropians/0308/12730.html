Ron h:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Right now they seem to have the idea they can survive and 
<br>
thrive by seeking out sources of cheap labor.  Being thugs at heart they are 
<br>
also finding dictatorships (communist and other) that will sell them labor at 
<br>
<p>slave labor prices.
<br>
       But these thugs will not prosper.  As I see it they will be replaced 
<br>
here and elsewhere by better smarter managers.  I see those managers coming 
<br>
from people such as you find on this list.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ron, from your keyboard to Allah's email box! ;-)
<br>
Here is an interesting opinion from Reason magazine, and one that I like 
<br>
since its seems insightful to me.&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.reason.com/links/links073003.shtml">http://www.reason.com/links/links073003.shtml</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;Take this howler from IBM spokeswoman, Kendra R. Collins, &quot;It's not about 
<br>
one shore or another shore. It's about investing around the world, including the 
<br>
United States, to build capability and deliver value as defined by our 
<br>
customers.&quot; 
<br>
<p>No, it's about working the cost side of balance sheet in search of profits; 
<br>
revenues have <A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/fin/l/i/ibm_ai.html">been flat</A> for two years and show little sign of improving. This 
<br>
is what good managers do, and there is no reason to be ashamed of it if you 
<br>
truly think you are going to make the company stronger. 
<br>
<p>But the catch is that out-sourcing is being embraced without much sign that 
<br>
it will actually make high-tech firms, particularly software companies, more 
<br>
effective. Highly collaborative, imaginative work might suffer in the hands of 
<br>
technically adept but inexperienced programmers. 
<br>
<p>The Times also passes along some dubious information on the actual cost of 
<br>
Indian outsourcing which makes the pay gulf between the U.S. and elsewhere seem 
<br>
impossibly wide. Stephanie Moore, vice president for outsourcing at &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.forrester.com/">http://www.forrester.com/</a>&quot;&gt;Forrester 
<br>
Research&lt;/A&gt;, claims that &quot;crackerjack&quot; Indian programmers can be had for $5,000 a 
<br>
year. That might be close to what the programmers see, but it doesn't 
<br>
represent the cost to a U.S. company to outsource. &quot;
<br>
<p>Ron h &amp; Mitch-- two pro-capitalists, who know that corporate ass-licking has 
<br>
worked for centuries as the easiest means to achieve; but that ass-licking 
<br>
doesn't bake bread or micro-chips! :-D
