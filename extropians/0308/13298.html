I read somewhere a few years ago about a guy that came up with an electric
<br>
vehicle design augmented by a flywheel engine. This design was supposed to
<br>
keep the same power available for quick, high-power takeoffs since the
<br>
flywheel was always running.
<br>
<p>Does anyone remember reading baout this? I think it was Discover magazine.
<br>
What ever happened to that? It seemed at the time to be the solution to the
<br>
problem of electric cars ebeing under-powered.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make an electric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vehicle where at least some of the batteries pop out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and are replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; charged batteries. Suppose for example when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bought your car you leased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your batteries from some company, say Exxon. (Gotta
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have something for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; poor multinational to do). A decent electric vehicle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will get about 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; miles on a charge. Suppose on those occasions where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you need to travel more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than 100 miles you could pull into an Exxon station
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and a little robot would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pull out your spent batteries and replace them with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; charged ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The standard keyphrase for this is &quot;distribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system&quot;.  Put simply: how do you get those stations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set up in the first place?  (Yes, there are gas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stations now, but how do you pay for refitting those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the robots you mention prior to enough people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having these cars to make it economically viable?  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chicken-and-the-egg type problem.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Much the same problem faces hydrogen-powered fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells, which have much the same characteristics as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; batteries (at least as matters to cars: fuel cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breathe air, but this matters not in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application; they exhaust water vapor instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing, but this also makes no diff to cars) except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have higher power storage densities (thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing longer trips between refuelling).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As it is now, I've got to make a weekly stop at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gas station, so this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; setup would definitely be more convenient. I'd love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to come home and simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plug-in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having operated an EV1 before they were scrapped, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can tell you that your dream - in this regard - is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right-on.  Granted, I had to plug in every few nights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (battery range over 100 miles, daily round-trip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commute under 50) or I'd be out of fuel, but it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an easy habit to get in to.  (I still remember a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend's joke about the power meter: an 11-bar gauge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing how full the battery was.  &quot;Bars of power&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounded a little like I was powering it with cocaine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or similar, but what else could one call it, simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough for daily usage?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the problems was, most people apparently did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (still do) much more than 100 miles of driving per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day, and in many cases, the only practical place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plug in was at home.  There were other chargers, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even 10% - probably not even 1% - as many per
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit area as gas stations, and charging was a slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough process that it really had to be at some place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were going to be at for several hours - which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually meant work or home.  Battery swapping robots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have solved the latter part of that, but then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get into liability issues if a broken battery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets swapped in which doesn't fail until you're 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miles from civilization and 40 miles from a charger.
</em><br>
