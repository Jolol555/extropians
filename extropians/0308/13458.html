<p>Not meaning to be bothersome, but doesn't it strike you that your use 
<br>
of language is interesting, I mean:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The *tone* of the original piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this thread was grossly partisan.
</em><br>
<p>Notice here that the content of the original piece is not judged for 
<br>
its veracity, just the &quot;tone&quot;.  As for it's being &quot;grossly partisan&quot;, 
<br>
just consider the other options:
<br>
<p>&quot;pleasantly partisan&quot;
<br>
&quot;commendably partisan&quot;
<br>
&quot;absolutely true&quot;
<br>
&quot;well thought-out&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  waaay over the top in ascribing problems
</em><br>
<p>Again, here, without going into the details of the actual facts of the 
<br>
matter (6.4% unemployment increase month after month for the duration 
<br>
of the Bush administration, exactly mirroring the negative unemployment 
<br>
from the previous administration). The term &quot;waaay over the top&quot; is 
<br>
well, &quot;waaaay over the top&quot;.
<br>
<p>So far that's &quot;waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot; for the substance 
<br>
of your post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fairly left-leaning NPR
</em><br>
<p>Here again &quot;fairly-left-leaning&quot; is a meaningless adjective.  What is 
<br>
&quot;fairly left leaning&quot; in detail?  Is it like a color-ascription?  From 
<br>
my point of view, NPR is a state-run apology machine for the 
<br>
liberal/conservative dichotomy which is itself just a propaganda 
<br>
technique for oligarchical control.
<br>
<p>You may mean, as people often do, by &quot;left-leaning&quot; people who care 
<br>
about politics from the point of view of the citizenry and who attempt 
<br>
to explain the observed behaviour of politicans and political figures 
<br>
objectively in terms of their material grounds.  In that case, NPR is 
<br>
surely NOT left-leaning.
<br>
<p>In any case, that's &quot;fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly 
<br>
partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bush fiscal policies that the kind of rhetoric in the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece was just silly.
</em><br>
<p>Here again, we have a combination of half-truths &quot;The recession was 
<br>
well under way&quot; as if &quot;the recession&quot; is something objective, some 
<br>
single state of affairs that happened like a firestorm when it gets too 
<br>
hot.  &quot;The Recession&quot; if anything is the continuing lack of investment 
<br>
of capital in new ventures in the American Economy coupled with an 
<br>
unbearable tax burden and talent/resources drain of a war.  The lack of 
<br>
investment of capital in new ventures can be directly correlated to the 
<br>
perceived weakness in corporate debt which can be directly correlated 
<br>
to the terrifying failures on the part of the regulatory committees to 
<br>
keep the thieves in line.  The Banks simply don't want to pay for any 
<br>
more Ken Lay's and so they've redirected their debt portfolio to 
<br>
low-interest real-estate backed consumer loans.  This strategy is 
<br>
outlined in a Federal Reserve Bank circular which can be found at the 
<br>
new york Fed site.
<br>
<p>Now we have &quot;silly, rhetorical, fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the 
<br>
top, grossly partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; silly rhetoric is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offensive and sets off partisan alarm bells.
</em><br>
<p>Who knows?  I think people appreciate just hearing the facts, the 
<br>
rhetoric is mostly transparent on both sides.  There's no doubt that 
<br>
people find Republicans offensive, whether or not they find knowing 
<br>
that there's a month-after-month increase in unemployment of more than 
<br>
6% shouldn't be offensive, people have a right to simply know.  Drawing 
<br>
conclusions from those facts isn't necessarily a partisan issue.
<br>
<p>Economists generally look at the Material Basis for political impact.  
<br>
If you just do THAT nowadays, you get the &quot;partisan alarm bells&quot;.  
<br>
Well, people need to be able to analyze their economic and political 
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>Now we have &quot;offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
<br>
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To extreme partisans on both sides, it doesn't seem possible that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable person of good will could disagree.
</em><br>
<p>The keyword being &quot;extreme&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now we have &quot;extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
<br>
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; have any kind of meaningful dialogue between the extremes on these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe.  Why not try?  Let's start by not calling each other extremists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (As an indication of where meaningful dialogue *is* possible, I give 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example a group of my close personal friends who maintain a mailing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The list includes newspaper publishers, academics, state officials and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyers.
</em><br>
<p>You mean where the well-educated nice &quot;lefties&quot; hang out, as opposed to 
<br>
us mean-spirited, silly, fairly-left-leaning extremists?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreement, but no lack of civility.
</em><br>
<p>Civility is simply what the people in control want.  You have to ask 
<br>
yourself why the people who are NOT in control don't want civility.
<br>
<p>When you have a genuinely open forum, it gets ugly and useless 
<br>
sometimes, but civility is just not an issue.  People should learn that 
<br>
debate of genuinely important issues is both - important, necessary and 
<br>
civil IN ITSELF and that sometimes it gets ugly.  The other option - 
<br>
silence - is simply unacceptable as it is just a transparent rhetorical 
<br>
tool equivalent to plugging your ears and saying you won't listen.
<br>
<p>In any case, it's now:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
<br>
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  the majority of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left-leaning Democrats on that list wholeheartedly supported
</em><br>
<p>Now:
<br>
<p>&quot;minority, un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, 
<br>
fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p>opposite for wholeheartedly, half-hearted?
<br>
<p>&quot;half-hearted, minority, un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, 
<br>
rhetorical, fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I've never seen on that list of extremely well-informed people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accusations of &quot;Nazism&quot; against the Bush administration, despite some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful unhappiness about the 2000 election.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, this other &quot;dream-list&quot; of well-informed civil democrats who 
<br>
uniformly and wholeheartedly supported the Afghan conflict sound like a 
<br>
bunch of (insert wimpy expletive here).
<br>
<p>They're the &quot;Good Left&quot; as opposed to us &quot;extremist, ignorant, 
<br>
fairly-left-leaning, un-civil, minority&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;un-informed, un-happy, half-hearted, minority, un-civil, extreme, 
<br>
offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, fairly-left-leaning, waaay over 
<br>
the top, grossly partisan&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The bottom line is that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought the original post was so extremely partisan that it *began* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion in a way that discouraged civility.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a failure to distinguish between the civil rights of citizens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those of non-citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Make that &quot;non-discriminate, obstructionist, un-informed, un-happy, 
<br>
half-hearted, minority, un-civil, extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, 
<br>
rhetorical, fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, grossly partisan&quot; 
<br>
left-leaning, extremist, etc.&quot;
<br>
<p>BTW - Jose Padilla is an American Citizen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In responding to your post, I was trying to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&quot;contentious, opponents of the law, obstructionist, un-informed, 
<br>
un-happy, half-hearted, minority, un-civil, extreme, offensive, 
<br>
alarming, silly, rhetorical, fairly-left-leaning, waaay over the top, 
<br>
grossly partisan&quot;
<br>
<p>Now these are the bad-words you've used in this one post to describe 
<br>
people who don't agree with you.
<br>
<p>The question you should ask yourself is WHO is responsible for the 
<br>
&quot;extreme, offensive, alarming, silly, rhetorical, contentious, 
<br>
obstructionism, waaay over the top, grossly partisan dialogue.&quot;
<br>
<p>That said, if you'd like to discuss the FACTS of the matter, we might 
<br>
have a place to begin.
