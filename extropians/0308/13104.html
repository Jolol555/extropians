<em>&gt; We agree that: Communists are awful. Terrorists are awful. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam was awful.
</em><br>
<p>Well, let me be the first to welcome you to our minority viewpoint.
<br>
Glad you can admit it.  But don't say 'we agree' unless you mean merely
<br>
you and I, because other members of this list obviously do not agree
<br>
with that statement.  Because members of this list have argued in favor
<br>
of anarcho socialism, that the 'good guys' won in indochina, that Kuwait
<br>
wasn't a legit country because Saddam didn't recognize it, etc. etc. I
<br>
will continue to repeat that communists, terrorists, and saddam are
<br>
awful and present evidence supporting that statement until I no longer
<br>
see such odd statements on this mailing list, or until I come across
<br>
convincing evidence suggesting the none of those things are awful.
<br>
<p>I know my anti-communists and terrorists articles are quite distracting
<br>
to your 'land of lets only talk about whats wrong with the US' possible
<br>
vision of this mailing list, but I'm sure recent developments in this
<br>
list will help to bring about such a vision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's also awful that other things in parts of the world where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have a direct influence are awful.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, it is.  At least in the US, though, the things that will get you
<br>
tossed in jail are pretty well established, documented, and supported by
<br>
the majority.  All one need to is not steal, assault, kill, or deal
<br>
drugs.  
<br>
<p>And as far as influence, as an American my vote obviously was able to
<br>
directly influence the continuation of a murderous tyrannical regime.
<br>
But this begs the question, is there anything we truly do not have *any*
<br>
influence on?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Any link Damien?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, that CSM piece was sent to me by someone else, and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't wish to repost the whole thing in breach of copyright.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't asking for the whole article to be reproduced violating
<br>
copyright, I would have liked to seen a link to the article to read more
<br>
about the study.  I would genuinely be interested to know how they
<br>
determined the incarceration rate in other not so open societies, like
<br>
communist ones, or tyranical dictator ones, or oppresive theocracies.
<br>
E.g. Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, North Korea, China, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, etc.
<br>
etc.
