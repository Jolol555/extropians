<em>&gt; I think it's most likely there are &quot;old folk&quot; out there who's activities

are
<br>
<em>&gt; inscruitable and invisible to us, but rather than existing sedately I
</em><br>
expect
<br>
<em>&gt; they're experiencing life at a level of complexity and meaning beyond our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current comprehension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Observation: Why not just substitute space intelligences for God? Its
</em><br>
fits the
<br>
<em>&gt;     description, at least in my head.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I understand your point here, unless you are suggesting that
<br>
this might account for various god myths, based on assumed interaction
<br>
between highly advanced &quot;space intelligences&quot; and ancient humans. I don't
<br>
see any need to hypothesize God(s), whether as &quot;space intelligence&quot; or
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. Obervation: Your depiction is seconded by Hans Moravec, in Robot; who
</em><br>
wondered
<br>
<em>&gt;     if the reason the sky was silent is because all civilizations progress
</em><br>
until they gain
<br>
<em>&gt;     an access to &quot;interpretation space&quot; which itself is some kind of phase
</em><br>
space of
<br>
<em>&gt;     spacetime.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I should add this to my reading list.  Thanks.  I haven't read
<br>
Moravec, but Greg Egan has certainly been a strong influence on my thinking.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the technological development of civilizations would
<br>
tend to the following pattern:
<br>
<p>(1)  Evolutionary progess to a level of capability similar to ours
<br>
currently, (radio, electrical power, geo-scale construction, limited space
<br>
travel) where some artifacts would become visible outside their planetary
<br>
system,
<br>
<p>soon followed by
<br>
<p>(2) converging and accelerating knowledge base leading to either
<br>
self-destruction or (optimistically) a new and relatively stable plateau
<br>
constrained by the difficulties of dealing with intrasteller mass and
<br>
distance.  In the optimistic scenario, the civilization would work within
<br>
these physical constraints, and free of the instinctual drive to expand
<br>
simply for the sake of expansion, would make highly efficient use of local
<br>
mass and energy, and focus on local development (exploring all conceivable
<br>
forms of knowledge and interaction) leading to a very small observable
<br>
signature on the galactic scale.
<br>
<p>followed eventually by (crystal ball now vanishingly unreliable)
<br>
<p>(3) expansion on the level of stellar engineering and greater.
<br>
<p>I suspect that the key to understanding the Fermi &quot;paradox&quot; is that most or
<br>
all civilizations are at the level 2 plateau, and thus virtually
<br>
undetectable for a long period of time.  Given the relatively young universe
<br>
in which we find ourselves, isn't it likely that no one as far as we can
<br>
tell has yet made it to level 3? What is our best informed estimate of the
<br>
duration of level 2?
<br>
