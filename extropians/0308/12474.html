<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote to Phil]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So you are not an example of what Paul was talking about, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;hyperlexia&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm hyperlexic, but I found discrete mathematics to be quite a pain to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pickup; mind you I excelled at geometric proofs.
</em><br>
<p>Getting good at geometry proofs doesn't fit with the
<br>
rest of your narrative.  How old were you when you 
<br>
got good, or were able to get good, at geometry proofs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyways, long story short, it turned out that discrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics (as its taught generally) was too abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me (ergo too many directions to go in for a &quot;short&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof sans need)
</em><br>
<p>Well, according to <a href="http://www.hyperlexia.org/">http://www.hyperlexia.org/</a> my guess
<br>
is that you are/were only very mildly hyperlexic.  Did
<br>
you show many of the symptoms listed there?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I picked up discrete mathematics trivially, once I had found the key to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organize it around (in this case turing machines/automata/grammers).
</em><br>
<p>Have you ever read books like &quot;The Number Sense&quot; or &quot;The
<br>
Math Gene&quot;?  They describe how most people evidently have
<br>
from a very young age an almost concrete number line built
<br>
in.  It's much as if a little measuring rod were right there
<br>
in the head, and one can kind of directly compare numbers
<br>
like one and two to it.  Babies appear to have it too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was very clear to both me and my professor though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I didn't &quot;learn&quot; discrete math the same way other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people did... It took a fundamentally different approach... 
</em><br>
<p>It's as though you had to hack up in software a number line
<br>
or something that others had built into their hardware.
<br>
There is a certain form of verbal reasoning that I'm no
<br>
good at, and have always felt that I had to &quot;hack up&quot; a
<br>
substitute for what came naturally to others.  Or maybe
<br>
I just don't trust my native reasoning ability in addition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another really interesting portion is that the symbolic processing extends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into my kinesthetic system (its got a different name now, but I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember it off the top of my head).
</em><br>
<p>Proprioception?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have extremely good sense recall when it comes to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeletal muscular system, including the direction of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said muscles when it comes to acquiring new skills.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the equivalent of a shorthand grammar; I tell my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muscles what I want them to do and they do it.
</em><br>
<p>Again, it makes me think you have no number &quot;feel&quot; at
<br>
all, because otherwise the feature you are mentioning
<br>
would map right onto it, and you'd be very good with
<br>
numbers.
<br>
