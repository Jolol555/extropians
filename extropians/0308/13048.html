<br>
<p>Greg,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you have just put your finger on the problem and also 
<br>
unknowingly shown that you do not understand what is going on.  Let me attempt to 
<br>
explain it to you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accounting and I suppose in law there is a concept of ownership.  
<br>
As you pointed out this list has owners -- no one to my knowledge disputes 
<br>
that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition there is the concept of a Stakeholder.  If we think of 
<br>
this as a grocery store there are not only the owners but also stakeholders such 
<br>
as regular customers, suppliers, etc.  These people have an interest in the 
<br>
store also.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to be having a battle between the owners of this list and some 
<br>
of the stakeholders.  Right now a large group of them seem to be voting with 
<br>
their feet.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, Mike seems to have been singled out for his specific 
<br>
political opinions.  If you don't agree I suggest you go back and read the chortling 
<br>
that took place on this list when it was announced he was banned.  Only this 
<br>
time read the specifics of what was written
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand we have a blessed few on this list from the idiotic 
<br>
wing of the left wing that are still as welcome as the flowers in spring.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, if you read the comments Natasha included in email it seems to 
<br>
imply that Mike was only the first.  Who wants to live under that kind of 
<br>
threat?
<br>
