<p><em>&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Lee Corbin&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So the big mystery to me is, why do we always assume the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; aliens to be such mean dudes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't have to assume they are &quot;mean&quot;.  You might just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume convergent evolution -- &quot;join the galactic club or else&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>No, the real reason that they are supposed to exterminate
<br>
minor races first reaching towards the stars is because it
<br>
would be consistent with the fairy tale that they're out there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why?  Because anyone with a long term view (i.e. a species that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has trumped the galactic hazard function) is going to take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint that &quot;its either my hydrogen or its your hydrogen --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I would prefer it be mine&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  That is exactly what you'd think from evolutionary
<br>
considerations.  The Europeans had the notion, not too surprisingly,
<br>
that Africa and the Americas were theirs for the taking.  Strange
<br>
it would have been, indeed, if they'd just posted signs at Gibraltar
<br>
saying &quot;STAY OUT&quot;.  Even totally unaccountably stranger still would
<br>
be if they had just remained completely hidden, but should any 
<br>
canoe approach from the tropics, just silently and relentlessly
<br>
commit a genocide against the adventurous tribe.
<br>
<p>Yet this is the fantasy that those who still hope for aliens
<br>
expect us to believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; YES!  For sure there would be WARNING SIGNS in huge capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; letters from the galactic club saying &quot;STAY HOME&quot;.  But all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we hear is total silence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Caca.  The cost of eliminating a species that attempts to step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;over the line&quot; is *zero*.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  The cost in missed opportunities is enormous.
<br>
They have to remain hogtied in everything they do for
<br>
fear of making any noise, or letting any of their
<br>
potential victims get any hint of their existence.
<br>
Preposterous.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, all that wonderful nanotech could be reforming
<br>
planets, stars, and galaxies galore---but then they'd let
<br>
us *know* that they were around, and oh my, we can't have
<br>
that!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Re: &quot;Invasion of the meme snatchers&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Entirely possible.  More work should be done on its possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities and limits.  And more thought should be given to how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we might detect this (e.g. you can fool some of the people some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the time but you can't fool all of the people all of the time.)
</em><br>
<p>No one has ever advanced even a slightly persuasive reason
<br>
why it would be in their interest to remain mysterious and
<br>
secretive.  No, it's a story just to advance the fairy tale,
<br>
so that people can continue to harbor their alluring and
<br>
intriguing fantasies about &quot;aliens&quot;.
