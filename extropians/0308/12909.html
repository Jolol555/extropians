<p>My ethical system begins with &quot;The qualium of desire may not be denied&quot;, but
<br>
I bet you might be surprised that it leads me to e.g. advocate compulsory
<br>
liability insurance in certain situations.
<br>
<p>What practical injunctions do you derive from the good professor's dictum?
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any economic progress is good?  Al Capone's?  Kenneth Lay's?  Dennis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kozlowki's?
</em><br>
<p>### I don't know who is Dennis Kozlowski. Al Capone's progress came at the
<br>
price of losses to a lot of people, and represented a net loss to the
<br>
economy. Therefore, in agreement with what I wrote above, it was not
<br>
progress, and he was a bad thing to happen.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Economic progress must be maximized, within a coherent, volitionist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ethical framework. This might mean using moral symmetry, Rawlsian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reciprocity, and a few other heuristics which have been found to aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; economic progress, while rejecting egalitarianism, tribalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; male/female chauvinism, taboos, and everything else that interferes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with economic growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You mention Henry Ford below.  He violated almost every &quot;good&quot; point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are making above.
</em><br>
<p>### Well, his workers kind of liked the way he paid them, and the customers
<br>
liked his cars, there were no bodies dumped in the river (AFAIK), so I
<br>
couldn't judge him harshly, although I am sure that if his greed and
<br>
ambition were not acting within something resembling a free market, he would
<br>
be happy to be a very bad person, as exemplified by his collaboration with
<br>
and support of the Nazi party. I've known it for a long time, but for me
<br>
it's the outcome, not the intention, that matter in social analysis (which
<br>
is different from daily life, but this is a different story).
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It is good to be rich. Therefore, anything that interferes with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; growth of the average sentient's income, is bad. It doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if you share with others, or if you hoard. The only thing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; matters is how much you contribute to the average increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wealth. Feelings of fairness, justice, are wrong, if they interfere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with the growth of average income of the Rawlsian observer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fairness and justice are paramount.  &quot;Remember your humanity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget the rest.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>### Define &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;justice&quot;. And every two-bit dictator, preacher,
<br>
demagogue, or union boss has his own private definition, too.
<br>
<p>My &quot;Average income in constant dollars&quot;, &quot;Rawlsian observer&quot;, are about as
<br>
clear-cut as it gets. You cannot hijack them to your own benefit, because
<br>
they are much more observer-independent, reason-based, than the
<br>
feeling-based categories of justice and fairness. This is why I suggest
<br>
using them in the formulation of ethical systems which are supposed to serve
<br>
large numbers of people, in fact, all people who want to live long and
<br>
prosper.

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt; All the emotionally rousing images you quoted, for the rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thinker, are yet another reason to support economic growth, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; maintaining individual freedom. Henry Ford did more for American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; children than the nameless bureaucrats who drafted child labor laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Once the children's parents became rich enough, children's labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stopped being a problem. World War II did as much for women as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; feminism - once women entered the labor pool, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned&gt; that economic competition gives them the power that comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from financial&gt; independence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Henry Ford didn't do squat that someone else would not eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done ... but without being such an asshole:

<p>### Yes, I know he was. So what? Is the world worse off because of him?
<br>
<p>They say Torquemada had the makings of a saint. Is the world better off
<br>
because of him?
<br>
<p>I am a consequentialist.
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The working conditions of the 19th century were wrong, because most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people were then poor, and it is wrong to be poor. Concentrate on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; creating wealth, not righting wrongs, and all wrongs will right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you lived in the 19th century, is this what you would be telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to half of the population in the USA (women), to the (mainly) Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laborers who built the Transcontinental Railroad, to the slaves, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the children laboring in the factories:  &quot;Concentrate on creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth, not righting wrongs ...?&quot;  Is this what you would be telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### One of the best methods of creating wealth is to free slaves (so they
<br>
happily work and enrich themselves and everybody else, instead of having
<br>
labor wrested out of them by overseers). A good method of making the tenth
<br>
child of poor parents richer, if you don't have the money to pay for his
<br>
schooling, is to give him work (rather than have him starve). As I mentioned
<br>
above, removing the legal and customary impediments to economic progress of
<br>
women, allowed a great creation of wealth, and righted a great wrong at the
<br>
same time. Racial and ethnic discrimination is one of the major limits to
<br>
wealth creation and is ruthlessly punished by a free market.
