</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your distaste is duly noted.  However, I disagree.  It threw out a few talking 
<br>
ponts and gathered some of what I see as real problems with the current 
<br>
administration in one place.   Pure and simple.   I do not see what you could 
<br>
object to about that.  However, I do find some types of responses distasteful 
<br>
myself although only one so far in this thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've worked in the legal system of the United States every day for the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 19 years.  I've also studied the rise of fascism and other totalitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems in the 20th century as a major personal interest for over 30 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With that base of experience and knowledge, I find that likening the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration to Nazis utterly *absurd*.  Yes, there have been some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curtailments of civil liberties in some very, very few cases that have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguable connection to *foreign* terrorism.  
</em><br>
<p>Actually the wording of Patriot and Patriot II puts us much more broadly at 
<br>
risk.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That I know of, there have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been no real curtailments of civil liberties in wholly domestic cases. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None. Might the cases involving suspected foreign terrorist activity be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first trickle in some kind of tide that would roll back the main body of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil liberties in the United States?  I personally doubt it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously, although I'm glad they are taken seriously.  But they bear no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resemblance to the kind of wholesale destruction of civil liberties that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanied the rise of real totalitarianism to which this post makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison.  Thus I feel that calling the Bush administration &quot;Die Neue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reichstadt&quot; baseless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You do not consider a very soft and flexible defintion of &quot;terror&quot; and &quot;aiding 
<br>
and abetting terror&quot; and the wholesale denial of fundamental rights once the 
<br>
label is applied (without formal proof) to be a real danger?  How is it not?  
<br>
You don't consider the government granting itself the power to search any of 
<br>
our homes with far fewer constraints than ever before and without our 
<br>
knowledge to be dangerous and against the intent of the Constitution?   You 
<br>
don't consider the possibility of being accused of terror for whatever 
<br>
reasons, stripped of all assets (even including citizenship), detained 
<br>
indefinitely, without trial or legal counsel to be a real danger?   Then 
<br>
what, pray tell, would you consider dangerous?
