<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope you can see why this is unrealistic.  In a world full of

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; cowards, evil brave people take advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### A coward is a person who does not fulfill expectations it terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the willingness to face danger, including a failure to perform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; according to previously assumed obligations. A world of persons who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fulfill contracts would not be a world of cowards.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So according to you it's acceptable to be brave ONLY when fulfilling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts.
</em><br>
<p>### It is necessary to be brave only when fulfilling contracts, a subtle yet
<br>
important distinction. Non-contractual bravery may not be demanded - only
<br>
freely accepted obligations, such as in a contract (by definition, a
<br>
contract exists only in the absence of force or fraud) can be enforced.
<br>
<p>----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will it be your (15th century) opinion that citizens have a contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with each other implicit in their organization as a country by virtue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their birth?  Dusting off the REALLY old books, huh?
</em><br>
<p>### No, I explicitly reject the idea of the social contract. A contract may
<br>
exist only between sentients, to a much lesser extent between groups of
<br>
sentients, never between monopolistic (state, oligarchy, etc.) wielders of
<br>
power and individuals. A contract must be explicit to be enforced.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Such people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will assume risks according to a rational analysis of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; outcomes, design societies and themselves by recourse to game
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; theory, ruthlessly destroy defectors and face death if needed - but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; only if needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, they'd be brave.  Not only would the face death if needed, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would kill if needed.  We agree, you just don't like to call a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spade a spade - These &quot;calm, smart, relentlessly rational, long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinkers&quot; who are willing to &quot;face death if needed&quot; are just brave.
</em><br>
<p>### I'd rather think that what I refer to is not bravery, just rationality.
<br>
&quot;Bravery&quot; is a term too burdened with tribalistic, gory images. The
<br>
Invariants in &quot;Golden Age&quot; (John C. Wright) are not brave, merely calmly
<br>
rational, incapable of fear, incapable of bravery. This is my ideal.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Death to the brave!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's awfully hotheaded of you.
</em><br>
<p>### Yep, I am not perfect (yet).
<br>
<p>----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Whenever you project the outcome of &quot;goodness&quot; far enough into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; future, it becomes either identical with self-interest (however
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; defined), or else descends into incoherence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will you be giving a formal proof of this or do you have it on God's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority?  Well, you did leave &quot;self-interest&quot; open to be defined any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way you want so your statement here could be equivalent with &quot;Whenever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you project the outcome of goodness it becomes identical with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goodness&quot; which is clearly so, but not apparently what you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claiming.  To give this any sense at all you're going to have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define self-interest. It's doubtful that you could do this without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference to goodness. cf. Principia Ethica.
</em><br>
<p>### It is not my prerogative to define other sentients' self-interest for
<br>
them. I can however hypothesize that it is, similar to mine, the achievement
<br>
of whatever goals they act to achieve, ideally in the presence of sufficient
<br>
information needed to evaluate those goals in reference to other goals they
<br>
strive for. Therefore, &quot;goodness&quot; is for me getting what humans really want,
<br>
and the ideal society is the one that best serves the achievement of the
<br>
average Rawlsian human's goals, including my own personal goals. Goodness is
<br>
then defined in the context of my self-interest, not the other way around.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Calm rationality, and a long-term outlook are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we need to make the best world there can be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doubtful.  Calm rationality and long-term outlook has made this world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way it is NOW.  Is this the best world there can be? (in something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a tautological sense.)
</em><br>
<p>### Today's world the result of calm rationality and long-term outlook?!!!!!
<br>
<p>You really meant it?
