-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Robbie Lindauer
<br>
<p><p>...Now two family members must work to support a family of 
<br>
four.  Then only 1...
<br>
<p><p>Depends on what you mean by the term &quot;support&quot;.  If
<br>
one is satisfied with the standard of living they
<br>
had &quot;then,&quot; one minimum salary is way more than sufficient
<br>
to make it happen.  We expect more now, so it should
<br>
come as no surprise that it costs more.  Earning a
<br>
subsistence level survival is cheaper and easier now
<br>
than ever before, and getting more so all the time.
<br>
One needn't even work: standing on a city streetcorner
<br>
with a &quot;Will Not Work for Anything&quot; sign will get you 
<br>
all the donations needed to survive.
<br>
<p><p>...Then, you could pay for a piece of land capable of 
<br>
sustaining your own family within 7 years by working...
<br>
<p><p>Today you can earn enough to support yourself in
<br>
a similar manner by working only a few months.
<br>
Look around you, Robbie.  Farmland is as cheap as,
<br>
well, dirt.  It costs practically nothing.  If all
<br>
you need to do is eat, like the &quot;then&quot; people, it
<br>
is so simple even the hippies managed it, after
<br>
a fashion.  
<br>
<p>But there is little need for all that effort.  Most
<br>
farmers will let poor people glean the fields after
<br>
a harvest today, and there is *plenty* of discarded
<br>
clothing available for nothing or nearly so, clothing
<br>
much more comfortable, durable, practical and even 
<br>
fashionable than anything the &quot;then&quot; people could 
<br>
have managed.
<br>
<p>There is plenty of land in the U.S. which cannot
<br>
be farmed *profitably* for various reasons, but
<br>
which is still perfectly farmable for food production
<br>
on a family scale, as demonstrated by the Amish.
<br>
This land can be had for a few hundred dollars an
<br>
acre, all of it you want.  Granted, it might not
<br>
be near any cities or actual roads, but it has
<br>
water and good soil, land that the &quot;then&quot; people
<br>
would have gone to war to secure.
<br>
<p>If you don't care for any of the luxuries that we
<br>
have today, the cars, the electronics, the internet, 
<br>
the medical care, the stuff that the &quot;then&quot; people
<br>
didn't have, earning a living has become so simple
<br>
as to be trivial today.  spike
