<p><em>&gt; Ok, this sounds like a very *interesting* challenge.
</em><br>
<p>When I was a young adult I worked two low-paying jobs for a while so I could
<br>
save money to start a business. Office job during the day, waitress job at
<br>
night.
<br>
<p>Since I was trying to save money, I kept my food bill to a minimum by eating
<br>
brewer's yeast, bread, and vitamin C. .
<br>
<p>I only did this for a year or so. Don't know what the long term effects
<br>
would've been, but during the time I was eating this way, I felt great and
<br>
never got sick. Both my food expense and prep time were almost nothing (I
<br>
bought already made bread rather than baking my own). For the sake of full
<br>
disclosure I should add that I supplemented this diet by eating leftovers at
<br>
the restaurant (I used to pitch the dishes I especially liked, in hopes that
<br>
the customer would leave some for me), but the leftovers made up a fairly
<br>
small % of my overall diet.
