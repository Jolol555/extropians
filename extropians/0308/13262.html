<em>&gt; The New Yorker has an interesting article about a new book which claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the cost of having kids is ruining the middle-class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another reason for the dropping birthrate?
</em><br>
<p>Don't know if the articles mention this but... I've read that the &quot;single
<br>
income family&quot; of the 1950s was an aberration (and I'd suspect not fully
<br>
widespread anyway.)  The US had a working industrial economy, the rest of the
<br>
world was bombed out or agricultural, unions and corporations were strong,
<br>
manufacturing jobs were common and paid a lot (vs. manufacturing jobs in the
<br>
19th century, say.)  But the historical norm is for both parents to work.
<br>
<p>Which is the other thing: housewives weren't idle, except in the 1950s, or in
<br>
the upper classes.  (And often not even there, depending on the upper class.)
<br>
Women's (and children's) helped support the home.  But these days, a person
<br>
staying at home in urban areas doesn't have much to do to economically support
<br>
the home.  There's cleaning and maintenance, but nothing really in
<br>
food/energy/clothing/income production.  To support the family as normal the
<br>
wife has to go get a job... but then you lose the benefit of relatively easily
<br>
taking care of the children.  Thus day care and second car expenses, and the
<br>
mother has to bring in not just her share of the income but extra income to
<br>
replace the 'free' benefits from working at home.
<br>
