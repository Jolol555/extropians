<em>&gt; I'm not sure I understand the relevance of the voting

</em><br>

<em>&gt; that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might change their behavior in response to the signals they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of their posts. Think of it as somewhat like a market. We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producers of messages and we want as many people to &quot;buy&quot; our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messages as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible. If I send out messages that have a high perceived 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise to signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratio many people will put me in their killfile, so I will have fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;buyers&quot;. I agree about the perennial dangers of centralized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while what I am suggesting is not immune from distortion, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangers of corruption are fairly minimal. The public display of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfiles might look like a table with everyone's name on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list (there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is what about a 1000 people on this list?) on the X and Y 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axis. I could look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up your name and see if I am in your killfile and you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look up my name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see if I am in your killfile. One conjecture then is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal their dislike of someone's posts by using the killfile this may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce the acrimonious exchanges that sometimes go on. If we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are having such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an exchange I might put you in my killfile and you might retaliate by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting me in your killfile--and so would end the exchange. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next to each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's name would be the number of people that have entered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him or her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into their killfiles. The conjecture is that people might change their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior so as not to be entered into too many killfiles. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take an extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example. Suppose an individual posts tons of Nazi propaganda 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every day. I conjecture that almost all will enter this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person into their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfiles, hence the Nazi's voice will go unheard. This Nazi 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot complain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about a centralized authority squashing her voice since the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfiles are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set by individuals. As I said, the right to free speech does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not entail an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obligation on others to listen. The reason this system would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impervious to corruption is that each person's killfile would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be displayed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there was an attempt to discredit someone by artificially 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfile quotient this could be easily detected because each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfile is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assignable to a specific individual. If the list managers tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificially raise your killfile quotient they would have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assign it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some individuals, say one of them is me. When I look and see that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences have been tampered with I will scream bloody blue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder on and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the list.
</em><br>
<p>I'm on record here as supporting the use of killfiles (I certainly use them
<br>
myself - as an aside, I've noticed that half my killfile has been unsubbed
<br>
or quit in disgust in the last day or two. ROTFL).
<br>
<p>I support Mark's idea above; I think public killfiles are a great idea; it's
<br>
a strong decentralised alternative to moderation.
<br>
<p>But I'd call it a filter; what you are doing, after all, is filtering the
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>For an implementation, I'd actually like the option to receive all the email
<br>
from my killfile, but with a tag in the subject like &quot;[filtered]&quot; so that I
<br>
can have them automatically shunt them into a different mail folder, as I do
<br>
like to peruse my killfile occasionally.
<br>
<p>Anyway, that's two thumbs-up from me.
<br>
