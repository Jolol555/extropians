<p><em>&gt; &gt;I just want to know), if you recall, was the other species

<em>&gt; &gt;(in *that* book alone) represented as having any compassion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for humans?  Were there such parts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See, this is what I find most mind-boggling in your faulty recollection of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the book. How could a reader have missed this pivotal moment of cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and affective breakthrough?
</em><br>
<p>You have neatly explained *why* I forgot it!  It made so damned
<br>
little sense!  (I have a lot of trouble, I readily admit, 
<br>
recalling nonsense.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess I just have to type the damned thing out:
</em><br>
<p>Thank you.  I, too, have made numerous sacrifices for the sake
<br>
of the truth ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Andrew Wiggins (Ender) speaks of the hive species, the `Buggers', he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exterminated:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt; They found me through the ansible, followed it and dwelt in my mind. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the agony of my tortured dreams they came to know me, even as I spent my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days destroying them; they found my fear of them, and found also that I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no knowledge I was killing them... We are like you; the thought pressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into his mind. We did not mean to murder, and when we understood, we never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came again. We thought we were the only thinking beings in the universe,
</em><br>
<p>Now how likely is that?  We haven't met any other thinking
<br>
entities in the universe, and it would come across as pretty
<br>
suspicious as an excuse for waging war.  (&quot;Oh, sorry---I didn't
<br>
know you were alive.&quot;)
<br>
<p>I know that this was not Card's intent, but in retrospect it was
<br>
a coolly told story to at least get Ender to save the Queen.
<br>
(I remember that much, though maybe Card only added that in
<br>
the insipid sequel to this great book.)  It worked, and she
<br>
was not killed.
<br>
<p>So frustrated at the syrupy story &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; did
<br>
I become, that I began fervently hoping as I read it that the
<br>
Queen would roar back at first chance, and exterminate the
<br>
whole stupid human race. It would serve Ender and the rest
<br>
of the idiots right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;And if somewhere there is a race of totally genetically determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;entities open to no dialog at all, but among whose purposes is our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;complete elimination, then why don't aren't you in favor of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;completely wiping them out if we can?    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd be up for that, implausible though it seems.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, thank you for answering.
<br>
