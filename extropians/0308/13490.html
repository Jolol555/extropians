<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----

<em>&gt; Okay, now let's look at the law known as &quot;Uniting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strengthening America
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Act&quot;  aka the USA Patriot Act (signed into law by President Bush in late
</em><br>
<em>&gt; October, 2001).
</em><br>
<p>Barbara, I'm now sandwiching a legislative history review of 50 U.S.C. secs.
<br>
1701 et seq. into other stuff I've got going on this weekend.  I note that
<br>
the original bill was passed in 1977 during adminstration of &lt;humor&gt; that
<br>
dreaded imperialist and well-known oligarch, Jimmy Carter &lt;/humor&gt;:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1701.notes.html">http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1701.notes.html</a>
<br>
<p>The link above is interesting.  As I'm sure you've noted, the entirety of
<br>
sec. 1702 is premised on the authority defined in sec. 1701, which in turn
<br>
defines at least some limits to the exercise of presidential power.  Such
<br>
limits are the first (but I'm sure there are many more) bases I see as an
<br>
advocate upon which to craft challenges to the application of the law.
<br>
<p>Also worth the long, slow download is the complete text of all the Executive
<br>
Orders signed under authority of the law since Pres. Jimmy.  With this much
<br>
material, I see the second element upon which I'd write my brief (if I had
<br>
to get one to the courthouse by tomorrow): These supply a body of practice
<br>
against which to judge any particular order.  It's interesting to note the
<br>
wide variety of situations to which this law has been applied, from the
<br>
Balkans to Central Africa.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The specific sections that concern me are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 106, which expands the circumstances under which the president may issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Executive Orders to confiscate the property of non-US citizens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by amending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Section 1702 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (Title 50,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chapter 35 of the US Code) [I think such a provision may well be useful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combating terrorism, but I would like to see more involvement by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the courts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here. As written, I think this provision will harm foreign trade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what can happen was recently reported in the NYT. An importer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of oreintal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rugs had already paid for a shipment from China, and the shipment was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enroute when that State Department published the following notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the May
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 23 Federal Register:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ==================
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SUMMARY: The U.S. Government has determined that a foreign entity has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaged in missile technology proliferation activities that require the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imposition of measures pursuant to Executive Order 12938 of November 14,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1994, as amended by Executive Order 13094 of July 28, 1998.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EFFECTIVE DATE: May 9, 2003.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ================
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As this is not considered a &quot;taking&quot; by the U.S. government, the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importer will not be compensated and has simply lost the $100,000 he paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the rugs, as they were required to be destroyed by U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customs agents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that these particular executive orders were issued under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior law, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the PA.
</em><br>
<p>How is it not a &quot;taking&quot;?  Maybe I missed something (I'm reading quickly, in
<br>
between other chores).  If it is indeed authorizes the seizure of a
<br>
citizen's property with no legal recourse, then you'll see me signing up to
<br>
an amicus brief to find it unconstitutional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If one could be 100% sure that such provisions would be used ONLY against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad guys, I'd say fine, go for it. But people make mistakes, both innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not so innocent. Even basically good people are often corrupted when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're given too much power (I've seen it happen over and over during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 16 years I've been a CPA/lawyer).
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely.  I want to see legal action to challenge any
<br>
unconstitutional law or executive action, and I spend a little here and
<br>
there to support public advocacy groups that do just that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'M GOING TO END HERE, SO AS NOT TO TRY THE PATIENCE OF OTHER LIST MEMBERS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHO MAY NOT SHARE MY FASCINATION WITH LEGAL CODES.
</em><br>
<p>Since you're almost a *tax lawyer* for crying out loud, you've got an unfair
<br>
advantage over an old courtroom ham like me, but I'm now committed to
<br>
working my way through this stuff.
