The book also figures in (slight spoiler) Umberto Eco's _Name of the 
<br>
Rose_, where it is discussed. Most likely Eco knew about the medieval 
<br>
rumors and played with them for his story (very well worth reading). 
<br>
<p>Given that Aristotle's text were little more than lecture notes compiled 
<br>
by others it is hard to tell what he might have said or not.

<p>I think the usual reason is that it was considered somewhat irrelevant;
<br>
while we enjoy laughter, &quot;real medicine&quot; should deal with major
<br>
illnesses and core issues of the mind. It is just recently the 
<br>
neuroscience of emotion has become popular, and the psychology of 
<br>
positive mental states is also just getting started.
<br>
<p>I know there are many other humor theories. Freud had some important
<br>
early ones distinguishing between &quot;innocent&quot; and &quot;tendentious&quot; jokes,
<br>
where the later have a sexual or aggressive content. Raskin had a theory
<br>
that we laugh when we encounter something that is dompatible with two
<br>
different semantic scripts which are opposite in one of a number of
<br>
particular ways. Veatch suggests a theory where the semantics of the
<br>
situation is normal but the affective context is absurd

<br>
<p>And Sasha had an IMHO nicely cognitive theory where we laugh due to the 
<br>
surprise when a cognitive set is transformed:

Boston)
