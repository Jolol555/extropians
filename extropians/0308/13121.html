</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They should be prevented, in NEGATIVE a way.  That is, the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures that tend to coerce people into selling themselves (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under-selling themselves) should be removed.  The only way a person can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be brought into a position where they bargain their lives for money is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the damage of force, corporatism and statism is already done.
</em><br>
<p>Please define your terms.  What the heck is &quot;corporatism&quot;?  What precisely is 
<br>
the difference between selling one's labor/skills/knowledge to a 
<br>
non-corporate vs. corporate customer/buyer?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you see thousands upon thousands of people put in the position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having to bargain for their lives, you know that something has gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desperately wrong, in general, it's economic oppression enforced by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is your alternative exactly?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is no breach of contract, fraud, neglect of parental duties,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; monopoly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ownership of resources, and no use of non-consensual violence, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not immoral, according to my consequentialist ethical system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here we are in partial agreement, although you don't want to extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;non-consensual violence&quot; to economic pressure.  I do.  It's backhanded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say someone is freely entering into a contract if not accepting that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contract would cause them irreperable harm (either economic, social,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't reality itself give &quot;economic pressure&quot; in that on most places on 
<br>
earth food and other necessities, much less satisfaction of wants doesn't 
<br>
drop out of the sky?  If I want that which is not present for no effort then 
<br>
I must engage in efforts to procure it.  If it is a reasonably complex need 
<br>
then it probably will pay to specialize.   If enough people want certain 
<br>
things then economies of scale may be had by running larger companies.  Is it 
<br>
automatically &quot;non-consensual violence&quot; if I must either pay some others or 
<br>
some company for something  or work for them if they are the primary source 
<br>
of that something?    I am really unclear on what you do and do not include 
<br>
under &quot;economic pressure&quot;.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outcomes of actions which do not exhibit the features I mentioned are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guaranteed to improve the average well-being of humans, I consider such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions to be good or neutral until proven otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand the ends justifying the means, however, I see that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ends are children living in puddles of their own pee.  You seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the ends are immortality or something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I didn't see anything like &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; in the above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ### Well, it is exactly the point - Nike is not forcing anybody to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; work for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them, they come begging for work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're right, Nike isn't forcing them, but their government is.  Nike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is paying the government for that particular service.  Even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant, the largest shareholders of Nike are paying them for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; service through the WTO and World Bank.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Is this contention actually proved?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ### If you are talking about protecting the free market from state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interference, I am all for it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Definitely.  Including freedom of currency?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You bet!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### No, poverty does not exist because of Nike, but despite Nike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, here we just have a plain disagreement.  Nike takes valuable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources from Burma and relocates them to the United States and takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the profits for themselves.  This has the generalized effect of making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Burmese poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod.  Since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Burmese are becoming poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are likely to be able to, if they so desire, perpetuate the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that impoverishes Burma.  Indeed, we know that this is the case BECAUSE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IT IS HAPPENING.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What valuable resources?  Valuable to whom if Nike wasn't present?  How 
<br>
valuable?  Burma has a great number of reasons its economy suck that have 
<br>
nothing to do with Nike.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It happens both at the direct level - shoes and money for nike - and at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the global-economic level.  Cash from the WTO (funded by Citigroup,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutchebank, Credit Lyonnaise, Barclays, etc.) goes to the Government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Burma which then buys military supplies to ensure it's ongoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to enforce its rule over its people.  Meanwhile, Nike which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority owned by those same interests, goes and takes advantage of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap labor created by the oppressive government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do  you see it differently?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In part.  You will get no argument from me that some of the policies of 
<br>
WTO/IMF cause increased poverty and instability.   However, I don't think the 
<br>
formula is a simple as the above and I certainly don't think that having Nike 
<br>
go away from Burma would help their situation one whit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Businessmen invest where labor is cheap, thus causing labor to get more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the mechanism by which this happens exactly?  Can you site any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical precedent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It has been done to death in standard economic texts. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Businessmen do not keep people poor. Politicians do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technically, they work together to keep people poor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>For what purpose?  Do you believe wealth is static?   Is there some reason 
<br>
that being employed is going to make one poorer than not being employed?  
<br>
Less skilled?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Businessmen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can only become a force of evil if they buy the services of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; politicians and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; armies, which is actually a rare occurrence. In most cases, political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems *feed* on business, not the other way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you familiar at all with the World Bank?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; On the other hand, if we were to call the owners of Nike to account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; PERSONALLY for the actions of the corporation, for instance, by making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; it illegal to be an owner of a company that utilizes child-labor or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; forced labor or sub-poverty labor, then we'd have something worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Owners of Nike (I might be one too, I haven't looked at the list of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stocks in my mutual funds for a long time) should not held responsible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their actions, beyond the value of the stock they bought, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accordance with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, since &quot;the law&quot; was set up specifically to prevent the owners of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nike from taking any responsibility WHATEVER for the actions of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation, here we just have a straight disagreement.  The law really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be changed to make the owners of a company jointly and severally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for the &quot;official&quot; actions of the company.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It should not be illegal to utilize child-labor, or sub-poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labor (whatever this might mean), since it is not immoral for children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; poor people to contract for sale of their labor. Only the use of forced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; labor is wrong, since it involves non-consensual violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How often, would you say, are children sold into slavery consensually?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Liability of joint stock corporations for harms inflicted can easily be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; handled by a compulsory, free-market liability insurance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You think this would make things better for the people living in mud
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huts?  Once again, can you explain the mechanism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The correct way of helping poor children is to offer education support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (perhaps in the form of a loan) and protection from abusive parents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than prosecuting persons who offer gainful employment to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I hear your claim, but the mechanism has been around FOREVER and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet, there they are, children playing in pee in the streets because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sewage has never worked...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The correct way of helping poor people in general is to offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; employment to them (or removing the political obstacles to it, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definitely agree with you),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about enabling them to become productive themselves by releasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ownership of their property to them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What property is that?  The factories are not their property.  Off of their 
<br>
wages and growing skills they can acquire property and start businesses of 
<br>
their own.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; perhaps more attractive than wages at Nike - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not trying to shut down Nike by political fiat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No one's trying to shut down nike.  Just make Nike play nice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>However, I don't notice very concrete proposals or thought on what &quot;nice&quot; 
<br>
really is.  What I do see is a lot of broadsides against business, 
<br>
capitalism, corporations and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, prosecuting &quot;villains&quot; is a more exciting path than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; helping others to a better life by a consensual exchange of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considerations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so the former strategy achieves undue prominence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.  Being a missionary is ONE good way of directly helping poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children in Burma.  Will that solve the long-term problems there?  No.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Selling some system of throught that brings psychological comfort will not 
<br>
neccessarily address many real problems.   Doing the equivalent of triage and 
<br>
teaching  a little that is useful is of some help.  But it does not take a 
<br>
missionary to do that nor need it be sacrificial.  Starting a business or 
<br>
opening branches in such a country is one non-sacrificial way of improving 
<br>
conditions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If you look at the workers of an impoverished country as desperate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work, what incentive could someone capable of providing better wages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have for actually going and competing for resources in that country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's bad business.  If Nike is paying $2/day, Addidas wants to pay $1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if Nike is doing business in Burma, Addidas will go to Angola.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's how &quot;REAL BUSINESS&quot; works.
</em><br>
<p>If Adidas wants more dedicated workers or to take the workers already trained 
<br>
by Nike, then Adidas will pay more.   In practice this is how real business 
<br>
works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you seriously think that we're going to run out of poor countries in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which workers can be exploited?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you seriously think there is that large a market for utterly untrained 
<br>
human labor?  Do you believe that trained labor will not increase in value 
<br>
and be competed for?
