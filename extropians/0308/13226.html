<p>Ref: The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going
<br>
Broke by Elizabeth Warren, et al
<br>
Release Date: September 2, 2003
<br>
<p>The New Yorker has an interesting article about a new book which claims
<br>
that the cost of having kids is ruining the middle-class.
<br>
Another reason for the dropping birthrate?
<br>
The article also points out that having fewer children will mean big
<br>
financial problems in the future.
<br>
<p>Also in the Financial Times (UK)

<p>Quote:
<br>
You might, then, expect American families to be luxuriating in good
<br>
fortune. But, compared with people who don’t have children, people who
<br>
do are in worse economic shape than they’ve ever been in. The Harvard
<br>
law professor Elizabeth Warren and her daughter Amelia Warren Tyagi
<br>
demonstrate, in their forthcoming book “The Two-Income Trap,” that
<br>
having a child is now the best indicator of whether someone will end up
<br>
in “financial collapse.” Married couples with children are twice as
<br>
likely as childless couples to file for bankruptcy. They’re seventy-five
<br>
per cent more likely to be late paying their bills. And they’re also far
<br>
more likely to face foreclosure on their homes. Most of these people are
<br>
not, by the usual standards, poor. They’re middle-class couples who are
<br>
in deep financial trouble in large part because they have kids.
<br>
<p>In the past two decades or so, the cost of having children has risen
<br>
much faster than the cost of being childless. Conventional wisdom aside,
<br>
this has little to do with spoiled kids, acquisitive parents, or
<br>
PlayStation 2. Instead, it’s the result of two things: housing and
<br>
education. According to the Federal Reserve Board, between 1983 and 1998
<br>
the price of housing for married couples with children rose seventy-nine
<br>
per cent in real terms, roughly three times as much as it did for
<br>
childless people. One reason is that houses are bigger now. But,
<br>
according to Warren and Tyagi, the real reason is that parents get into
<br>
bidding wars for homes in safe neighborhoods with good public schools.
<br>
<p>Then, there’s college. Thirty years ago, middle-class parents could feel
<br>
they’d done a good job of raising a child if he or she made it through
<br>
high school—decent jobs for unskilled and semi-skilled labor were
<br>
readily available. Today, such jobs are much harder to find, and college
<br>
is considered a necessity. Needless to say, it is also extremely expensive.
<br>
<p>The United States has $6.7 trillion in debt and forty trillion in
<br>
potential obligations to the elderly or soon-to-be-elderly, and we’re
<br>
sticking future workers with the bill. Even if the American birth rate
<br>
stays where it is, we’re headed for serious trouble. If it drops, look out.
<br>
<p>End quotes.
<br>
<p><p>Food for thought?
