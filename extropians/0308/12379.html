</em><br>
<em>&gt;and consequently alienation (alienation is to be understood here as &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;estranged to oneself&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have a working answer but I would like to hear what others think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm sorry that I missed your email.  I read some of the replies and thought 
<br>
I should reply myself.  I hope that some of my thoughts below are 
<br>
useful.  Right off, I see that the above basic premise is mistaken and if 
<br>
we simply clarify this, the rest will be very easy to answer.
<br>
<p>First, you (or those who you are talking to) have mistaken Primo with some 
<br>
otherly-type-of-concept.  Primo is a prototype future body design.  It is 
<br>
not exclusively machine.  It is a combination of biology and technology.
<br>
<p>[RANT:  Second, transhumanists are extropians (why do many people separate 
<br>
extropians and transhumanists!   Extropy is a transhumanist philosophy and 
<br>
the term &quot;transhumanist&quot; comes out of Extropy Institute.  &quot;Transhuman&quot; was 
<br>
co-created by Damien Broderick and a few others who used the term in 
<br>
different ways and for different purposes.) ]
<br>
<p>Third, (Now, back to Primo), Primo is not an &quot;impossible&quot; body.  It is 
<br>
certainly a concept that has high potentiality for being produced in design 
<br>
shops.  Industrial design and product design communities are currently 
<br>
working at designing aspects of Primo-type body parts.  As I write this, I 
<br>
am looking at 4 posters in my studio produced by FH Joanneum, 
<br>
Fachochshulstudiengange der Technikum Joanneum GMBH, Industrial Design, de 
<br>
- sign - mail design products in Graz.  Primo was featured at a conference 
<br>
this group attended.  They produce highly imaginative and beautifully 
<br>
designed products to enhance human disabilities and others for 
<br>
communications and transportation.
<br>
<p>Fourth, Primo's philosophy is to accommodate and unite our human need for 
<br>
survival with our current biological abilities.  These abilities: mobility, 
<br>
intellection, imagination, communication, etc. are what keeps us striving 
<br>
ahead toward the future.  Primo's prototype is designed to accommodate our 
<br>
need to survive by introducing better means for survival by enhancing our 
<br>
mobility, intellection, imagination, communication, etc.
<br>
<p>Inasmuch, your use of the word &quot;ascetic&quot; is the very opposite of 
<br>
Primo.  The correct modifier would be sensual, abundant, and 
<br>
comfortable.  The same for &quot;alienated&quot;.  Primo is the opposite of being 
<br>
estranged from oneself.  If you study its communication grid, you will see 
<br>
that  it was designed for the brain to know what the body is doing 
<br>
24/7.  It unites the brain to the body's functions.  Further, the metabrain 
<br>
is a far better communicator than the human brain in that it has advanced 
<br>
sensing abilities and fast-track communications with the others in it's 
<br>
ability to share memory and experience.
<br>
<p>I hope this was helpful Sébastien.
