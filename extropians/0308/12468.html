<em>&gt;Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;P.S.  So you are not an example of what Paul was talking about
</em><br>
&quot;hyperlexia&quot;?
<br>
<p>I'm hyperlexic, but I found discrete mathematics to be quite a pain to
<br>
pickup;
<br>
mind you I excelled at geometric proofs.  Anyways, long story short, it
<br>
turned
<br>
out that discrete mathematics (as its taught generally) was too abstract
<br>
for me
<br>
(ergo too many directions to go in for a &quot;short&quot; proof sans need)... I
<br>
got discrete math
<br>
when I studied the subject (theory of computation) that it was intended
<br>
to
<br>
be used in.  Prior to actually seeing the end results (the end use of a
<br>
theorem),
<br>
I found it difficult to divine what was the intended result of the
<br>
theorem and ergo
<br>
a particular pathway to the end result (formal proof) in the alotted
<br>
time...
<br>
<p>I picked up discrete mathematics trivially, once I had found the key to
<br>
organize
<br>
it around (in this case turing machines/automata/grammers).  I
<br>
*understand* calculus
<br>
(the foundation, thought processes) intuitively though.  Same goes for
<br>
geometry and
<br>
algebra.  It was very clear to both me and my professor though that I
<br>
didn't &quot;learn&quot;
<br>
discrete math the same way other people did... It took a fundamentally
<br>
different
<br>
approach... 
<br>
<p>Another really interesting portion is that the symbolic processing
<br>
extends into my
<br>
kinesthetic system (its got a different name now, but I don't remember
<br>
it off the
<br>
top of my head).  I have extremely good sense recall when it comes to my
<br>
skeletal
<br>
muscular system, including the direction of said muscles when it comes
<br>
to acquiring
<br>
new skills.  I have the equivalent of a shorthand grammer; I tell my
<br>
muscles what I
<br>
want them to do and they do it.
<br>
<p>anyways, i think its fascinating, although to be quite honest, I wasn'
<br>
particularly
<br>
happy that they chose to classify it as a disorder... I'm a big fan of
<br>
the DSM-4;
<br>
if it doesn't bother you, it shouldn't be a disorder... They seem to
<br>
have left that portion
<br>
out of the literature.. I think because they're targeting it towards
<br>
parents coping
<br>
with their kids (and the tendency towards antisocial behavior)...
<br>
<p>anyway,
<br>
just thought I'ld share (at least my perspective)...
<br>
<p>omard-out
