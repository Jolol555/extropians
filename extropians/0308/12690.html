<p>
Anders writes a nice piece in reference to an article
<br>
that I haven't read, but which is attempting to get
<br>
the &quot;rational&quot; meme (which can tolerate &quot;trade-offs&quot;)
<br>
out to the public.
<br>
<p>This is correct, in my opinion.  In some ways it's
<br>
close to &quot;adult thinking&quot; vs. &quot;child thinking&quot;.
<br>
A symptom of child-thinking is that it does not want
<br>
to entertain unpleasant trade-offs.  That's left to 
<br>
the adults.  Now that---as Anders explained---is not
<br>
the whole story.
<br>
<p>But it's possible that we need to see deeper into the
<br>
problem in the following way. This also dovetails with
<br>
our recent discussions.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, one aspect that we need to look at is
<br>
our *own* urge to break icons.  I wrote an essay not
<br>
long ago called &quot;What Happened to all the Iconoclasts?&quot;,
<br>
but did not post it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the 1950's the world seemed to be swimming
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with iconoclasts.  Probably few knew what the word
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meant (I did not), but one could tell that whatever
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were, there were plenty of them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word, though not the urge, has gone out of fashion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This list has lots of them, of course.  I want to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak about all of us who perhaps as good Bayesians
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should want to correct for this urge that we have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to break icons.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone really believe that Robin Hanson does not,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in some tiny recess of his mind, enjoy tweaking 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conventional tastes by proposing something that is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quite logical, but simultaneously outrageous to usual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tastes?  Does anyone here think that those of us very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in love with the idea of cloning aren't also---just a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wee bit---enjoying the avant garde feeling of endorsing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an aspect of the provocative future?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This urge is certainly at least as old as the chariots.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In complete defiance of all the wizened, hardened older
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experienced warriors, someone had to think that by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teaming up a pair of horses to a cart holding two riders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---one who drove and one who shot arrows from a semi-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stable platform as fast as he could---a fiendish new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapon of war could be produced?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Do I not at this very moment enjoy---just a wee bit---
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presenting an example aggravating to the instincts of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any crypto-pacifists on this list?)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we *should* exult in the novel, along with all true
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SF writers, part of whose theme in the trade is to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shock.  We should indeed be held only in check---in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this medium---by logic and reason, and otherwise
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truly enjoy wherever our imaginations take us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as I asked earlier, do we not need to correct 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for this impulse, and at least try to compensate for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our sheer enjoyment of the novelty of singularities,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uploading, terrorist futures, cryonics, and so on?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(P.S. to try to answer my own question, Yes, if we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wish to be only Bayesian truth seekers, but no, if
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we wish to remain human and favor the side all our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instincts and reason assure us is right.)
