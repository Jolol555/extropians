<p>Not really; it was published in a fairly broad journal,
<br>
but hardly Scientific American. He is undermining the
<br>
taboo of researching taboos and making it more clear that
<br>
even the sacred can be studied, so in the long run I
<br>
think this research will produce more rationality as it
<br>
seeps out thanks to popularizers (anyone want to do
<br>
that?). Bur right now it is mainly academic studies. 
<br>
<p>It is interesting to note another article in TICS I noted
<br>
recently: Pascal Boyer, Religious thought and behaviour
<br>
as by-products of brain function, Trends in Cognitive
<br>
Sciences Volume 7, Issue 3 , March 2003, Pages 119-124
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious concepts activate various functionally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinct mental systems, present also in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non-religious contexts, and `tweak' the usual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inferences of these systems. They deal with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detection and representation of animacy and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agency, social exchange, moral intuitions,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precaution against natural hazards and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding of misfortune. Each of these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activates distinct neural resources or families
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of networks. What makes notions of supernatural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agency intuitively plausible? This article
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reviews evidence suggesting that it is the joint,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coordinated activation of these diverse systems,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a supposition that opens up the prospect of a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cognitive neuroscience of religious beliefs. 
<br>
<p>A cognitive neuroscience of religion would be as 
<br>
dangerous for ill-considered religion as the fields of 
<br>
comparative religion and literary analysis of the Bible 
<br>
has been. 
<br>
<p><p>Tetlock has quite a few interesting papers:
<br>
<a href="http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/social/tetlock/tetlock.htm">http://www.psy.ohio-state.edu/social/tetlock/tetlock.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my opinion, one aspect that we need to look at is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our *own* urge to break icons.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, why is iconoclasm so fun? To some extent it is 
<br>
because it is easy attention from others - if you can 
<br>
take some criticism, then you can mine it for all its 
<br>
worth. Then there is the thrill of questioning the 
<br>
unquestionable - but why do we get it? Tetlock's theory 
<br>
only explain why people refrain from doing it, not why 
<br>
some people delight in it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     Does anyone really believe that Robin Hanson does not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     in some tiny recess of his mind, enjoy tweaking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     conventional tastes by proposing something that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     quite logical, but simultaneously outrageous to usual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     tastes?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know about Robin, but this is definitely true for 
<br>
me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Yes, we *should* exult in the novel, along with all true
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     SF writers, part of whose theme in the trade is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     shock.  We should indeed be held only in check---in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     this medium---by logic and reason, and otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     truly enjoy wherever our imaginations take us.
</em><br>
<p>We might be enjoying it even more because thinking the 
<br>
unthinkable brings us to the new. And we orient ourselves 
<br>
towards new sources of information - we are curious, we 
<br>
place value in learning new things or possibilities even 
<br>
when they do not have a direct use. 
<br>
<p>A reinforcement learning agent will normally only deviate 
<br>
randomly from its learned behavior and does not get any 
<br>
reward for it other than whatever reward or punishment it 
<br>
gets from the deviation. But imagine an agent that gets a 
<br>
slight reward for exploring. It will seek out unknown 
<br>
parts of its environment, learning where the greatest 
<br>
rewards are and then (since it now is hard to get the 
<br>
exploration rewards) exploit them, earning much more 
<br>
reward than the &quot;stay at home&quot; agent. 
<br>
<p>But the optimal level of exploration is impossible to 
<br>
know a priori, it depends on the environment and luck. So 
<br>
evolution would not set us all to the same level of 
<br>
exploration reward. We are distributed in this respect, 
<br>
with some people with more explorative personalities and 
<br>
others less. The explorers would get internal rewards for 
<br>
finding out more, even when it is useless or goes against 
<br>
the beliefs of others. Maybe this is another partial 
<br>
explanation for iconoclasm.
<br>
<p><p>It should also be noted that society is far more open 
<br>
today than in the 50's (largely due to the iconoclasts!). 
<br>
This means that there is less need to rebel, and 
<br>
iconoclasm can be aimed into &quot;safe&quot; pursuits such as art, 
<br>
gaming or showing off at the beach. The number of 
<br>
iconoclasts may not have decreased, but they are less 
<br>
visible.
