The Cryonics Institute has been ordered by to stop freezing bodies.

<p><p>State orders Cryonics Institute to stop freezing bodies
<br>
Associated Press
<br>
<p>LANSING, Mich. - The state on Tuesday ordered a company to stop freezing 
<br>
bodies after media reports surrounding the death of baseball legend Ted 
<br>
Williams alerted regulators that the practice was taking place in Michigan.
<br>
<p>Considered a founding father of cryonics, Robert Ettinger has proclaimed the 
<br>
possibility of freezing and unfreezing people to extend their lives. He is 
<br>
president of the Cryonics Institute in Macomb County's Clinton Township 
<br>
north of Detroit.
<br>
<p>But an investigation by the state's Department of Consumer and Industry 
<br>
Services found that the Cryonics Institute, which has frozen both people and 
<br>
pets, is operating an unlicensed mortuary science establishment and a 
<br>
non-registered cemetery.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are extremely concerned that people from around the world have invested 
<br>
their trust and finances into this facility to preserve their bodies for 
<br>
eternity, yet this facility continues to knowingly operate outside the scope 
<br>
of the law,&quot; CIS Director David Hollister said in a statement.
<br>
<p>David Ettinger, Robert Ettinger's son and a lawyer for Cryonics Institute, 
<br>
said the state's action is without merit and the company plans to fight the 
<br>
order.
<br>
<p>&quot;What we do is not what a mortuary does and not what a cemetery does,&quot; he 
<br>
said. &quot;We've been doing it openly in the state of Michigan for nearly 30 
<br>
years.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cryonics is the practice of freezing corpses in liquid nitrogen in the hopes 
<br>
that future technological and medical advances will allow for a second shot 
<br>
at life. The state has ordered the company to preserve the bodies in its 
<br>
care but accept no new ones.
<br>
<p>In Scottsdale, Ariz., at what could be one of the only other cryonics labs 
<br>
in the United States, the body of Ted Williams reportedly is waiting as his 
<br>
children squabble over his body. The case has been publicized by Sports 
<br>
Illustrated.
<br>
<p>Robert Ettinger opened the nonprofit institute in 1976 with two founding 
<br>
members who are now frozen in the lab's storage area. The first patient, in 
<br>
1977, was Robert Ettinger's mother, Rhea. The next was his first wife, 
<br>
Elaine. His second wife, Mae, also was frozen.
