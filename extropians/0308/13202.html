<br>
me as though people are being sorted out, by various market and political 
<br>
forces, into two major groups -- the smart and flexible; and the rest.
<br>
<p>Barbara,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep, you have taken a look around and came to the correct conclusions. 
<br>
&nbsp;The BELL CURVE and an author named Richard Epstein from the University of 
<br>
Chicago's School of Law have came to pretty much the same conclusion.  
<br>
Herrnstein and Murray in TBC concluded the bifurcation is due to our economy becoming 
<br>
increasingly high tech and in turn lifting up the top 5% of the Bell Curve for 
<br>
IQ.  In the last couple of chapters they seem to be describing a distopia 
<br>
(spelling??) for the bottom 5% of that same Bell Curve.  Richard Epstein see 
<br>
pretty much the same distopia forming at the bottom of our society.  RE sees the 
<br>
complexity of our legal system as one of the major culprits.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime some folks look at America's prison population and 
<br>
wonder what is going on?  Part of the answer, part, is due no doubt to our 
<br>
increasingly high tech economy and the increased competition of illegal immigrants 
<br>
is squeezing our less fortunate citizens out of employment and onto the dole or 
<br>
eventually into crime and imprisonment.
