</em><br>
<p>Your last statement is undoubtedly true and is a fine example of what you
<br>
go on to say about being programmed to want to die.  However, the problem
<br>
is that the mainstream actively oppose *all* work that furthers real life
<br>
extension in the foreseeable future, on the basis that it's absurdly far
<br>
away and hence anything remotely goal-directed at this point is a waste
<br>
of money.  This is of course self-serving -- by accepting that it's time
<br>
to start doing genuinely biomedical gerontology, the researcher who does
<br>
purely curiosity-driven stuff implicitly acknowledges that their emphasis
<br>
is misplaced -- and I'm afraid that is part of why it's so hard to get
<br>
biogerontologists to actually study the relevant biotechnological fields.
<br>
(It's difficult to say that something is impossible when you've read the
<br>
literature by those who are already most of the way there, but it's easy
<br>
when you haven't and can thus maintain your illusion that any such work
<br>
that others may speak of is overblown or erroneous or whatever.)
<br>
<p>My view, therefore, is that to a certain extent fire must be fought with
<br>
fire -- we must make such scientists uncomfortable (though in the nicest
<br>
possible way, of course).  The best way to make scientists uncomfortable
<br>
about their belief in a particular dogma is to challenge them to find a
<br>
hole in a position that contradicts that dogma.  That's why my &quot;How you
<br>
can help&quot; page (&lt;<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/how.htm">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/how.htm</a>&gt;) says this:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF YOU'RE A JOURNALIST: write about my work, but most importantly of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all please interview other mainstream biogerontologists (the more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;senior and high-profile the better) and ask them to explain why they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't think we'd cure aging any time soon by the approach I advocate.
<br>
<p>I find that my colleagues' opposition to what I say is diminishing very
<br>
rapidly -- more so than I'd expected, honestly -- and I believe this is
<br>
largely because I've been saying essentially the same thing for a couple
<br>
of years now without my position being found glaringly flawed.  If other
<br>
people start saying it too, to senior gerontologists' faces, it may not
<br>
be long at all before the balance of opinion (and funding) tips sharply
<br>
in the biomedical direction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With regard to logic being on our side. I agree, but a PhD does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically confer rationality in all facets of life. I've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying all my life to understand the knee-jerk &quot;hubris&quot; reaction people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like us seem to provoke, and still cannot understand it. It's almost as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the majority of the world is somehow programmed to want to die. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only useful thing I've learned from years of debates on this topic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to circumvent the issue by focusing attention on more 'mundane' aspects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the research.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, this circumvents the issue rather too thoroughly (see
<br>
above).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, there is one anti life-extension argument that I cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept, yet also cannot fully refute: overpopulation.
</em><br>
<p>You almost answered yourself here.  Since people are so overwhelmingly
<br>
fixated on the idea that making everyone live indefinitely is an awful
<br>
idea, the problem is not one of sociology, nor even philosophy, but of
<br>
psychology.  There is no appreciable prospect of making someone more
<br>
enthusiastic about life extension by describing how humanity might be
<br>
able to cope with overpopulation (or boredom, or loss of &quot;meaning&quot;,
<br>
etc): as you point out, they can just say &quot;but you're hoping for the
<br>
best -- it's safer not to go there in the first place&quot;.  No: what one
<br>
must do is ask them what they would do if given the choice between (a)
<br>
living for (say) the next year, but thereby (by some unspecified
<br>
mechanism) denying some unconceived person the chance to be born and
<br>
some other living person the right to procreate, or (b) giving those
<br>
people those chances, but dying in (say) the next year.  This is the
<br>
choice we will each be making, every day in one way or another, in a
<br>
post-aging world in the worst-case scenario where emigration off the
<br>
planet does not arrive (or does not appeal), birth rate fails to fall
<br>
fast enough, etc.  Thus, it is the choice we today give or deny those
<br>
who might be alive to have that choice if we develop real anti-aging
<br>
medicine as soon as we can but not if we delay.  (Those people may or
<br>
may not include some of us, of course.)  Putting the issue in these
<br>
personal terms is powerful, because the only way out of approving of
<br>
life extension while choosing (a) above (and while answering similar
<br>
questions about boredom etc similarly) is to argue that it's wrong to
<br>
give others a choice that one would take if one had it oneself, and
<br>
luckily that's a position that most educated people in the developed
<br>
world don't enjoy finding themselves taking.
