<p><em>&gt; It would work that way except for the fact that land

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Farmland?  Nah, it's just dirt,

<p>Anybody who claims that agriculture isn't as important any
<br>
more as it used to be 50 years ago should try living without
<br>
agricultural products for a year. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the tax structure of the U.S. is making it harder all

</em><br>
<p>It's not taxation that's making agriculture unprofitable.
<br>
Agriculture has all the properties of a free market that
<br>
make a farmer's life hard, and all the properties of a
<br>
regulated market that make a farmer's life hard. Companies
<br>
like Cargill make an easy profit of agriculture, buying
<br>
crop from farmers for near cost price no matter how good
<br>
or bad the harvest was.
<br>
<p>Of course, you couldn't make agriculture a truly free
<br>
market, because then the unprofitable part of the earth's
<br>
population would no longer be able to get food!
<br>
<p>Imagine the least profitable 0.5% of farmers or eaters
<br>
being left behind every year, like you would expect in a
<br>
truly free market.
