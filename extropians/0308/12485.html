<p>Yikes, I thought my memory was bad... If you follow the link you quote you 
<br>
can find a post from you responding to a part of my post that you can't 
<br>
recall seeing. See also 
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/archive/9912/48248.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/archive/9912/48248.html</a> where you 
<br>
responded to my sugestion of dumping entropy into black holes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is going to create a very interesting tradeoff -- if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the greatest computing capacity one is going to want a black hole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a small mass (smaller event horizon).  This is going to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the production of Hawking radiation and will decrease the lifetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the black hole.  So you may be able to compute &quot;more&quot; but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will do so for a shorter period of time before your means to do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fails you.
</em><br>
<p>A big unknown here is whether future SIs will have secure property rights.
<br>
If they don't have to worry about predation, then there is no reason to
<br>
trade total computational capacity for speed. They can just take their
<br>
time and maximize the total amount of computation they do over the entire
<br>
history of the universe.  If they do have to worry about it then they will
<br>
have to sacrifice long term computation for short term computation in
<br>
order to defend themselves. These two potential scenarios imply very
<br>
different things about the optimal computing architecture of the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To be honest I do not know.  In part I think it may be a decline on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the part of non-agricultural parents to need more children (to bring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the harvest, etc.).  In part I think it may be because parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (once they have control over reproductive processes) may choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus limited resources on fewer children.  It may be a shift from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I want 'more' children&quot; to &quot;I want 'better' children&quot;.  But those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would only be guesses on my part.  Though if the last hypothesis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct the development of inexpensive genetic testing and greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of how genes influence capabilities would suggest that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trends will continue.
</em><br>
<p>These are reasonable proximate causes for declining fertility rates in
<br>
rich societies, but I'm more interested in the ultimate (i.e.,
<br>
evolutionary) causes. Are we just lucky that unlike every other species on
<br>
Earth we are not all in a malthusian struggle for existence, or is there a
<br>
reason to expect this of most intelligent species? The former would be
<br>
better news than the latter, since it implies that the demographic
<br>
transition is part of the Great Filter, and that we're already past the
<br>
step.
