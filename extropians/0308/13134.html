<em>&gt;&gt; Glad you can admit it.  But don't say 'we agree' unless you mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; merely you and I, because other members of this list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obviously do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agree with that statement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Name one, by name, please.
</em><br>
<p>Jeff Davis, as I have all ready elaborated, said the 'good guys' won in
<br>
Vietnam.  Note those good guys, for the past 30 years, have been one of
<br>
the most oppressive regimes in the world, and killed more people in the
<br>
six months following the US abandonment of Indochina then died in the
<br>
entire war, and subsequently turned Cambodia and Laos into hell holes as
<br>
well.  
<br>
<p>I am sure there are others who have yet to go on record.  Samantha, who
<br>
won in Vietnam, the good guys or the bad guys?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We can debate forever about whether or not the wars fought in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indochina were ours to fight, whether they were winnable, etc, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ect- it's a dead horse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;folks- STOP BEATING IT!  I thought the Extropy list was about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the future, not the past...
</em><br>
<p>Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.  There is NOTHING
<br>
more anti-extropic than a communist government!  As a person who favors
<br>
extropian ideals, I would think other extropians should be concerned
<br>
about the single most murderous and anti-extropic form of government to
<br>
have ever existed on the planet.  The Extropy list is about promoting
<br>
extropian ideals, not specifically talking only about the future.  If
<br>
you do not like what I have to say, put me in a kill file, or complain
<br>
to the moderators, but do not pretend that events in the past have no
<br>
extropic relevance to the future.  In case you missed it, this murderous
<br>
expansionistic regime tried to take over the world over the past 50
<br>
years.  There is no extropianism in forced collectivization, starvation,
<br>
and poor ignorant peasant farming communities.  And currently a good
<br>
portion of the world still lives under these entirely unextropic
<br>
wretched conditions.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that Kuwait
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wasn't a legit country because Saddam didn't recognize it, etc. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's just ridiculous.
</em><br>
<p>It is ridiculous, but it was said.  I was shocked of course, since when
<br>
did a succession from a parent country require the moral sanction from
<br>
that country?  Seems absurd to me, especially when parent country was a
<br>
murderous despotic tyrannical regime. But it was said.  Perhaps the
<br>
Extropy list subscribers are not as clear minded and rational as you
<br>
thought they were.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Alright.  I'm going to start constantly posting messages 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stating that the sky is blue and the grass is green.
</em><br>
<p>If you consider the threat of communism equal in concern as people
<br>
arguing the sky is not blue, more power to you.  Personally, since
<br>
communism has killed 170 million people this century, and, as far as I
<br>
know, the 'Sky is not blue' cultists have yet to kill, maim, collective,
<br>
or oppress *any* its not high on my list of concerns.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Alright.  Damien posted a message reporting on how many people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are incarcerated in the US.  This is a major concern for many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people here and abroad.  Why does America have a higher crime 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate than the rest of the industrialized world?  
</em><br>
<p>Does it have a higher rate?  Or are its incarceration rates higher?
<br>
Perhaps we just catch more of the bad guys?  Perhaps certain stupid
<br>
aspects of American culture tend to re-enforce crime waves.  This issues
<br>
is very complex, though I would be the first to succeed that among the
<br>
free, open, west societies the US does have the highest incarceration
<br>
rates.  I just question the incarceration rate claims from notoriously
<br>
oppressive and closed societies, many of the worst of which we have no
<br>
data for whatsoever.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What can we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do about it?  How much of this &quot;crime&quot; is victimless in nature 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(such as drug posession)?  How many people are falsely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imprisoned?  How many of the rich and powerful manage to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;away with crimes and plea bargains while the same offense 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would land your typical young black man or native American in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prison for years?
</em><br>
<p>[snip various valid complaints about the US]
<br>
<p>How many people are executed for speaking out about their government,
<br>
rot in solitary confinement for decades, buried in mass graves for being
<br>
of a ethnic minority or of an ethnicity simply not in power.  Condemned
<br>
to lives of hellish poverty because the wealthy free post industrialized
<br>
west could care less.  I agree with all your criticisms of the US, I
<br>
just consider them hardly noteworthy compared to the atrocities of the
<br>
rest of the world.  The vast majority of the world would DIE to have to
<br>
deal with our worst problems, in fact, many people in the world DIE just
<br>
trying to have the CHANCE to deal with our worst problems.  Do you think
<br>
the high incarceration rate of the US is a deterrence for Cuban refugees
<br>
setting out in shoddy make shift rafts or crowding 100's of people into
<br>
storage containers to try to smuggle themselves in?  
<br>
<p>And furthermore, as is often ignored, our laws are firmly established
<br>
and on the books, arbitrary incarcerations, the norm in despotic
<br>
countries and communist ones, are few and far between in the US.  As I
<br>
said, don't steal, assault, murder, or deal drugs, and you have very
<br>
little chance of ending up in Jail in the US.
<br>
<p>You can complain about the injustices in the US all you want, and I will
<br>
agree with most every one of them.  However, comparing those to the
<br>
Injustices of people in North Korea or Vietnam, you are not going to get
<br>
me very excited about it until those people have our troubles to worry
<br>
about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Last week, our esteemed congressman, who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has a long history of speeding tickets and accidents, sped 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through a stop sign in his '95 DeVille- and killed a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motorcyclist.  
</em><br>
<p>As a motorcyclist myself, I say that sucks.  As an American, I further
<br>
say that sucks.  As an Extropian, I also say that sucks.  I don't see
<br>
any disagreement here, these are all egregious injustices.  But I ask
<br>
you, which sucks more, 300,000 people in mass graves, or a former
<br>
attorney general getting off with a light sentence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's definitely some hypocrisy in this system.
</em><br>
<p>I certainly agree!  But while people are getting their eyes gouged out,
<br>
and tongues cut off, and children raped, and babies heads smashed
<br>
against trees, beheaded, starved, tortured, etc. intentionally by
<br>
governments, I will focus my concerns on those governments.  Once their
<br>
worse problems are going to jail for smoking pot, then Ill be the
<br>
champion of the decriminalize drug use movement.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Editorial Comment: Replacing a murderous dictator with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;violent anarchy isn't necessarily progress.
</em><br>
<p>That's true.  But replacing it with a progressive western market based
<br>
economy is.  The result still remains to be seen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;China's incarcerated population is somewhere between 25 Million and 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Million- higher than the entire population of Iraq, imprisoned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without due process, often for dubious reasons.  Yet, while we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invaded Iraq, we instead support trade deregulation with China 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and hand them our industrial sector on a silver platter.  More 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypocrisy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As Frederick Douglas said, one must do the most they can at that moment.
<br>
What do you think would happen if the US sanctioned China?  Would China
<br>
say 'ah, sure, we'll reform, we've been wanting to anyway'  
<br>
<p>The only way China will change is through a great deal of time, or if
<br>
the Entire post industrialized west, the wealthiest and most militarily
<br>
powerful part of the world, which also happens to BE THE MOST FREE!
<br>
Stand united against the oppressive, tyrannical, and murderous regimes
<br>
of the world.  Given the recent events in Iraq, it seems unlikely that
<br>
the free, powerful, wealthy, post industrialized west as a whole will
<br>
ever give a shit about murderous oppressive regimes and the billions who
<br>
suffer under them.  By the time they do give a shit, it may be too late
<br>
to make a difference.
