</em><br>
<p>No it isn't, I've done the math.  With respect to solar power
<br>
the claims are clearly incorrect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...For instance, stating that economically viable natural
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>For &quot;natural&quot; gas deposits (within the North American continent)
<br>
his statements may be accurate.  But as Greg has pointed out this
<br>
just creates an opportunity for LPG tankers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, as prices go up, economically viable sources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magically appear.  I grow so very weary of the nattering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nabobs of negativity.  A hydrocarbon shortage

</em><br>
<p>Spike, without being able to fully determine the negative impacts
<br>
of things like increased forest fires, potential for negative
<br>
agricultural impacts (esp. in the midwest), etc. you CAN NOT
<br>
assert that the decline of hydrocarbons, or more importantly
<br>
the associated increase in atmospheric CO2 as we consume them
<br>
and the probable global warming as a result, would stimulate economic
<br>
growth!  Down in CA the news may not be providing coverage as
<br>
we here in Washington watch parts of British Columbia burnt
<br>
to the ground (and it nearly happened to parts of a city nearby
<br>
to Seattle as well).  Unpredicted consequences in complex systems
<br>
*are* a reality.
<br>
<p>You just don't have sufficient information for a model at this
<br>
time that would allow you to make such a strong claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we had an industry which creates wealth and cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be outsourced, such as blanketing the west with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solar cells, windmills and the infrastructure to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribute all that free clean power, the economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be stimulated to the verge of orgasm.
</em><br>
<p>Hardly spike.  The U.S. is mostly a service economy at this time.
<br>
That requires less infrastructure and more &quot;trained minds&quot;.
<br>
Training such minds is not something one does &quot;overnight&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...Or more simply: bluntly stating that wind and solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can not, under any conditions, &quot;replace even a portion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hydrocarbon energy&quot; - despite the fact that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite evidently have provided power that, had these technologies never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been invented, would come from other sources, presumably including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrocarbon energy.
</em><br>
<p>The argument (made by the interviewee, not Spike) is *wrong*, just plain
<br>
flat out wrong.  I've done the math.  And it doesn't have to require &quot;costly
<br>
infrastructure&quot;.  It can be done with low technology solar ponds that produce
<br>
methane on some large fraction of the &quot;rangeland&quot; in the U.S. southwest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...Still, there are some truths here, especially the bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about transmission capability not being built...
</em><br>
<p>This much I agree with -- there should be a long term project to build
<br>
up infrastructure such as high-temp superconductor energy storage and
<br>
transmission capacity.  It would be a wise move to adjust the regulatory
<br>
structure to support that.  Its just like building up the national highway
<br>
system in the U.S. in the '50s and '60s.
