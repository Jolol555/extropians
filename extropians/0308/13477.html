In  MCA, et al. v. Ashcroft and Mueller / Complaint for Declaratory and
<br>
Injunctive Relief, filed July 30, 2003, which is concerned with Section 215
<br>
of the Patriot Act.
<br>
<p>You can read the complaint here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.aclu.org/Files/OpenFile.cfm?id=13247">http://www.aclu.org/Files/OpenFile.cfm?id=13247</a>
<br>
<p>I urge everyone concerned about the transhumanist agenda to take the time to
<br>
read at least the portion headed STATUTORY LANGUAGE AT ISSUE.
<br>
<p>Here's a hypothetical to illustrate why Section 215 is relevant to the
<br>
transhumanist agenda:
<br>
<p>On April 3, 2005, Sam Trostle, a 78 year old U.S. citizen, gets the bad news
<br>
that he is suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which will continue to
<br>
erode his brain until he dies. There is no known cure. Sam wants to undergo
<br>
cryonic suspension, but if he waits until he dies, there might not be much
<br>
of his brain left to save. He has done research on the typical course of the
<br>
disease, and it looks as though his last months will be highly unpleasant,
<br>
both for Sam and his family. Sam learns of a facility in China that has
<br>
developed a promising suspension process that is considered a medical
<br>
treatment under the local law. Sam and his wife begin making plans to go to
<br>
China, where Sam expects to spend his final days before being suspended. In
<br>
May, 2005 Sam makes a payment of $60,000 to the facility. Sam's bank duly
<br>
makes a Suspicious Activity Report (see US Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by
<br>
US Patriot Act). The FBI uses this report to get a secret warrant to search
<br>
Sam's office and home. There they find literature about doing business in
<br>
China and filing tax returns as a U.S. Expatriate. They also find evidence
<br>
indicating that Sam has visited a doctor who advocates physician assisted
<br>
suicide.
<br>
<p>Sam sends in his passport for renewal on June 8, 2005. His application for
<br>
renewal is denied, because Sam is under investigation. Sam hires an
<br>
immigration lawyer to try to find out what's going on. By January, 2006, Sam
<br>
is no longer able to talk coherently. The lawyer is still working on the
<br>
case but has made little progress. In March, 2006 Sam's wife tells the
<br>
lawyer she no longer wants him to pursue the case.
<br>
<p>On July 4, 2006 Sam dies in Birmingham, Alabama, never having had the chance
<br>
to leave the U.S.
