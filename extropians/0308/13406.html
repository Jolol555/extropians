You know what's funny here is that when things go bad, we blame it on the
<br>
president. When things go well, we give the president credit. But I hardly
<br>
thing that the President really has enough power to really change theses
<br>
things or create these problems.
<br>
Yes he has spent a lot of money on the military.
<br>
No he hasn't stepped up to the late on energy.
<br>
But really, the economy is it's own monster. It was slowing down prior to
<br>
Bush taking office. Sept. 11 didn;t help matters.
<br>
Sept 11 may have been an intelligence failure, but nothing is 100%. How many
<br>
tips do they really get on terrorist plots? How many turn out to be real?
<br>
How much can you change an organization like our intelligence community in
<br>
the 9 months that he had? You can;t shut down the airlines every time
<br>
someone threatens to attack our country.
<br>
<p>I don't think what we did in Afganistan was wrong. They had it coming.
<br>
Iraq is a different story, Saddam is a bastard who kills his own people by
<br>
the thousands. He has needed to go for a long time. The world will be a
<br>
better place without him. Do the ends justify the means? I don't know.
<br>
<p>Tax cuts are not bad. It's simply a matter of letting everyone keep a bit
<br>
more of their own hard-earned money rather than confiscating it. If we need
<br>
to balance the budget, we should be doing it by reducing our expenses.
<br>
<p>I'm not a big fan of Bush, especially the way he invokes &quot;God&quot; at every
<br>
opportunity, but I think that this &quot;resume&quot; is rather juvenile and only
<br>
serves to polarize those that already dislike him. The President only does
<br>
what he thinks he needs to do to get re-elected. That's the way the country
<br>
was set up. To fix our problems, we need to change the way the people think,
<br>
not sit around and complain about our leaders.

<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A &quot;resume&quot; for GW Bush currently circulating on the web, worth reprinting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, I think:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history. I set
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month
</em><br>
period. I
<br>
<em>&gt; set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S.
</em><br>
stock
<br>
<em>&gt; market. I am the first president in U.S. history to enter office with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal record. I set the the all-time record for most days on vacation
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; any one year period. After taking-off the entire month of August 2001, I
</em><br>
then
<br>
<em>&gt; presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history. I attacked and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overtook two countries, promised to rebuild them and have not yet done so.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; am supporting development of a &quot;Tactical Bunker Buster&quot; nuke, a WMD. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting our troops killed, under the lie of WMD components, then blaming
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; lie on our British friends and the CIA, where, coincidentally, my daddy
</em><br>
used
<br>
<em>&gt; to lead. I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president. In my first year in office over 2 million Americans lost their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs and that trend continues every month, leaving us in higher than ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unemployment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any president in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. history. I set the record for least amount of press conferences than
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; president since the advent of television. I signed more laws and executive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orders effectively amending or ignoring the Constitution than any
</em><br>
president
<br>
<em>&gt; in history. I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was
</em><br>
revealed.
<br>
<em>&gt; I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history and refused to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use national reserves as past presidents have done. I have cut health care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active
</em><br>
duty
<br>
<em>&gt; troops and their families -- in war time. I allowed non-compete oil
</em><br>
contracts
<br>
<em>&gt; to go to my VP's company (where he is still employed, but on &quot;deferred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensation&quot;) and won't answer to anyone about it. I have set the
</em><br>
all-time
<br>
<em>&gt; record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; venues (15 million people) shattering the record for protest against any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person in the history of humankind. I've dissolved more international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treaties than any president in U.S. history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in
</em><br>
U.S.
<br>
<em>&gt; history. I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration in U.S. history. My &quot;poorest millionaire,&quot; Condoleeza Rice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a Chevron oil tanker named after her. I am the first president in U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history to have almost all 50 states of the Union simultaneously suffer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive financial crisis. I presided over the biggest corporate stock
</em><br>
market
<br>
<em>&gt; fraud of any market in any country in history. I am the first president in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. history to order a pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; sovereign nation, and I did so against the will of the United Nations and
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; world community. I created the largest governmental department bureaucracy
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; the history of the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases,
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; than any president in history. I am the first president in U.S. history to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; am the first president in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; U.S. from the Elections Monitoring Board. I removed more checks and
</em><br>
balances,
<br>
<em>&gt; and have the least amount of congressional oversight, than any
</em><br>
presidential
<br>
<em>&gt; administration in U.S. history. I rendered the entire United Nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoints irrelevant. I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. &quot;prisoners of war&quot; (detainees)
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention. I am the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; 2002 U.S. election).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporate campaign donations. My largest lifetime campaign contributor,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; one of my best friends, (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. history. My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political party used the Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to
</em><br>
assure
<br>
<em>&gt; my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my 2000 election decision. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center
</em><br>
attacks
<br>
<em>&gt; and less than a year later made the U.S. the most resented country in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, possibly the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively working on a policy of &quot;disengagement&quot; creating the most hostile
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; Israel-Palestine relations in at least 30 years. I am the first to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to
</em><br>
world
<br>
<em>&gt; peace and security. I am the first president in history to have the people
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; South Korea more threatened by the U.S. than by their immediate neighbor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Korea. I changed U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be
</em><br>
awarded
<br>
<em>&gt; government contracts. I set an all-time record for the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration appointees who violated U.S. law by not selling their huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal investments in corporations bidding for U.S. contracts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I failed to fulfill my pledge to capture Osama Bin Laden, dead or alive. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed to capture Saddam Hussein. My family is very close with the Saudi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Royal family, and have been for years, so I kept the pages out of the
</em><br>
report
<br>
<em>&gt; on 9-11 that may put the Saudi's in a bad light. I failed to capture the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthrax killer who tried to murder the leaders of our country at the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Capitol Building. I have no leads and no credible suspects. Following the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; World Trade Center attack I have successfully prevented any PUBLIC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigation into the biggest security failure in the history of the
</em><br>
United
<br>
<em>&gt; States. I removed more freedoms and civil liberties for Americans than any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president in U.S. history. In a little over two years, I created the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided country in decades, possibly the most divided since the Civil War.
</em><br>
I
<br>
<em>&gt; entered my office with the strongest economy in U.S. history and have
</em><br>
turned
<br>
<em>&gt; every single economic category downward -- all in less than two years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Records and References: I have at least one conviction for drunk driving
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; Maine. My Texas driving record has been erased and is not available. I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AWOL from the National Guard. I refuse to take a drug test or even answer
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; questions about drug use. All records of my tenure as Governor of Texas
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; now in my father's library, sealed, and unavailable for public view. All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; records of SEC investigations into insider trading or bankrupt companies
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view. All records or minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from meetings that I, or my Vice-President, attended regarding public
</em><br>
energy
<br>
<em>&gt; policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public review.
