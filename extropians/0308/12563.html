<p>Guilty as charged.  After the &gt; &gt; &gt; levels get more than
<br>
a couple deep I get lost.  I am however reading &quot;most&quot; of
<br>
your posts Lee.  I have a selective browsing system in that
<br>
I read many of the posts in the Javien Forum so I can see
<br>
the relationships between the posts and then I go back and
<br>
respond to the posts in a normal email system.  It does
<br>
however mean I will miss posts from time to time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not see what safety has to do with it.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Distributed Replicated Intelligence&quot;
<br>
<p>A human brain cannot avoid the hazard function imposed by
<br>
an earthquake, an asteroid, etc.  However, if you have
<br>
redundant subcomponents distributed across 25 AU you can
<br>
trump those hazard functions.  It is basic &quot;fault tolerance&quot;
<br>
in computing data center configurations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, suppose that one is interested in finding the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ramsey numbers (a nice math problem).  Then one has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with off-loading a lot of the calculation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alpha Centauri, or participating in a galaxy-wide hunt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the solutions.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in which case the problem may not be to colonize
<br>
but to (a) identify *where* the SIs are; and (b) the
<br>
diplomatic problem of convincing them to work on the
<br>
problem once one opens a communication channel.  This
<br>
tends to require that the problem has more limited
<br>
data requirements (otherwise it requires a very long
<br>
time to communicate to more distant SIs).  It also
<br>
feeds into the problems I've discussed with respect
<br>
to &quot;What do SIs think about?&quot;.  For example do you
<br>
want to &quot;think&quot; about a problem that some other SI
<br>
in the galaxy solved 20,000 or even 2,000,000,000
<br>
years ago???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, and getting back to another issue, *this* is why we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be so appealing for the beings of Tralfamdor to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonize: we have plenty of unused cm^3s.
</em><br>
<p>But Lee, you are oversimplifying -- to use those cm^3
<br>
one needs (a) energy sources; (b) certain types of matter;
<br>
and (c) someplace to dump the waste heat.  One would
<br>
anticipate that *if* one were going to colonize one
<br>
would select optimal locations with a mix of those 3 resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's interesting that some remote copies you agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one should regard as self, while yesterday you seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain that very remote Lee II's would be nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats eventually.  Have you changed your mind?
</em><br>
<p>I have not changed my mind.  Lee II's are a hazard -- but
<br>
perhaps naturally only over billions to trillions of years.
<br>
The exception to this would be if Lee II's decide that Lee I's
<br>
are hazardous first and decide to minimize the risk that
<br>
Lee I's pose.
<br>
<p>Distributed Lee I's (within local space) pose a much less
<br>
difficult problem.  If one gets a rogue Lee I subcomponent
<br>
within a solar system one simply deletes it.  It is like
<br>
replacing a broken component in ones automobile.  But it is
<br>
*very* difficult to replace a component in a remote star system
<br>
if it is allowed to rise to your level of development.  Even at
<br>
light speed its 8 years round trip for information to/from
<br>
the Alpha Centauri system -- how do you deal with something
<br>
that has 10^42 OPS for 8 years (~10^51 OPS) to figure out
<br>
how to defend against something you may send or it may send
<br>
against you?
<br>
<p>One can hurl black holes across interstellar space but I
<br>
would presume that using X-ray telescopes they will probably
<br>
see it coming.  Electromagnetic radiation travels faster
<br>
than matter (or black holes) -- they have plenty of time to
<br>
disperse and regroup.  And when they do they may be very unhappy.
<br>
So they may be willing to expend a significant amount of
<br>
matter/energy to balance the books.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who wrote that?  From the heading it appears to be Robert,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but then if so he is referring to himself in the third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is me talking about myself in the 3rd person.
<br>
Sorry, I should have perhaps added a :-).
<br>
<p>Robert
