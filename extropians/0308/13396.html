<p>
FWIW, here's a recent post to another list by Dr Evan Harris Walker, a
<br>
quantum theorist with radical ideas:
<br>
<p>==============================
<br>
<p>The recent visit to the tooth fairy to find quick fixes to recent
<br>
difficulties with the proposed &quot;inflation&quot; modification of the well
<br>
established Big Bang theory gave us dark matter. And now the latest trip to
<br>
that tooth fairy to fix the fix gives us dark energy. 
<br>
<p>Both dark matter and dark energy hypotheses arise as quick fixes to problems
<br>
relating to the well established general relativity of the very early Big
<br>
Bang universe. These data arise because of the application of one of our
<br>
cornerstones, general relativity, to a particular problem under development
<br>
that lies outside the domain of mesoscale physics. The properties of both
<br>
dark matter and of dark energy are such that they do not play a role in
<br>
mesoscale physics. The dark matter because it is believed by those who
<br>
propose it that it was made during the first moments of the universe when
<br>
the temperature of the universe was at energy levels some 13 orders of
<br>
magnitude higher than anything achievable on earth today, and represents
<br>
leftover non-interacting debris. Dark energy is believed to be an effect
<br>
that has to do with the hypothetical cosmological constant that comes into
<br>
play when very vast regions of space are involved, or when we are dealing
<br>
with very vast amounts of matter, many galaxies at a time, or when doing
<br>
things in the early morning of the universe. Though these are hypothetical,
<br>
the physics constraints are still present. These hypothetical animals of
<br>
cosmology are themselves as constrained as to what they can be allowed to do
<br>
as is the physics of the matter in the brain.
<br>
<p>Translate any of these into their effects on the mesoscale, and they vanish.
<br>
<p>Neither dark matter or dark energy mitigate either general relativity or
<br>
quantum mechanics to the slightest degree. The proposed particles lie
<br>
outside the standard model, but they also lie outside the realm of the
<br>
energy ranges achievable in any interactions on earth, even in billion
<br>
dollar accelerators -- a limitation I expressed early on.
<br>
<p>Now, I have spent about 15 years studying the problems mentioned here, so my
<br>
remarks are not off hand. Dark matter was proposed because inflation theory
<br>
needed more matter than was seen. The universe seems rather flat, but
<br>
flatness requires something like 10^-29 grams per cc (as I recall the
<br>
number) matter density in the universe based on general relativity. There is
<br>
observationally a 95% short-fall in this number (the exact number varies).
<br>
Since that matter was not seen, it was hypothesized to exist anyway -- sort
<br>
of the way invisable pink elephants are introduces, or that Harvey friend of
<br>
Jimmy Stewart.
<br>
<p>I have proposed that the reason for this density short-fall results from the
<br>
first generation of stars that formed when the universe first cooled to
<br>
about 1000 degrees at 300,000 years of age. At that time, 1,000,000 solar
<br>
mass stars began to form. The heat restricted what size stars could formed
<br>
to this million solar mass size. The portion of matter forming these is
<br>
calculable: 4%. Because of their mass, these stars burn and collapse very
<br>
fast. Because the universe does not spin, these stars are different from
<br>
most present stars and when they collapse because they immediately collapse
<br>
into black holes; within a millisecond, they reach their endpoint.
<br>
<p>Now non-rotating black hole stars pose something of a problem in physics.
<br>
The matter must go to a singularity -- infinitely small, infinite density,
<br>
infinite temperature. As they collapse, they retrace the steps in the Big
<br>
Bang.
<br>
<p>I made the proposal that as this happened, the &quot;inflationary&quot; episode of the
<br>
Big Bang would be retraced inside that Black Hole mass, and that would mean
<br>
that rather than matter coming out of the vacuum as happened during the Big
<br>
Bang inflation, the matter would go back into the vacuum. This is based on
<br>
somewhat generally accepted Big Bang inflation-era physics.
<br>
<p>If we suppose that to be the case, then the following happens:
<br>
<p>1. 1/3  the mass of each supermassive star, or about 1.3% of the mass of the
<br>
universe would vanish (this is based on details as to how black hole
<br>
collapse happen in supermassive stars. The collapsing &quot;stream&quot; breaks into
<br>
segments).
<br>
<p>2. This would send out a gravitational pulse detectable in the Weber-style
<br>
gravitational wave detectors at the rate of about 12/day seen by Weber (his
<br>
observed rate was 17/day). But Weber had been discredited because he was
<br>
seeing things that could not be there! Those of you who were at the Dallas
<br>
(as I remember) Texas PA meeting may recall Feynman ridiculing Joe Weber,
<br>
and may remember I stood up to take issue with him, both about Weber and
<br>
about his trite remarks about parapsychology. &quot;Professor Feynman, I know
<br>
Professor Weber. I am sure if he were here, he would be able to adequately
<br>
defend his work. I am sure that I speak for everyone in saying I am
<br>
disappointed with your talk. I was hoping you would talk to us about
<br>
something you have expertise in, namely theoretical physics. Many of the
<br>
people here have more knowledge in experimental design than you have and
<br>
probably know more than you about statistical procedures.&quot; At the time I had
<br>
worked out some of the details having to do with this proposal I am
<br>
discussing here.
<br>
<p>3. This would also result in the gamma ray bursters seen at the rate of
<br>
1/day (the rate is calculable) with gamma rays at 300 Kev red-shifted  down
<br>
from their original neutron-mass energy of 300 Mev. (The red shift comes
<br>
from the fact that they are at the edge of the expanding universe.) This
<br>
1/day rate is lower than that of the gravitational pulses seen by Weber
<br>
because the gammas can be absorbed and scattered in the dense environment of
<br>
the early universe while gravitational effects are not. The difference given
<br>
here is a calculated result.
<br>
<p>4. The loss of matter would mean that the density of the universe would go
<br>
immediately from 100% of critical density for flatness to 98.7%.
<br>
<p>5. As time passed, this 1.3% short-fall in density at universe-age of
<br>
300,000 to 1 million years would become a 95% absence of matter at present,
<br>
about 13.8 billion years. Because astronomers cannot find the 100% matter
<br>
for critical density needed for flatness, they have invented dark matter to
<br>
make up for what is missing from their theory.
<br>
<p>6. As the density dropped further and further from criticality for flatness,
<br>
the expansion would accelerate (as I said back in 1990), giving the
<br>
impression of an accelerating force, or dark energy.
<br>
<p>7. When the 1.3% mass was lost, the rest of the 4% in these superstars, 2.7%
<br>
of the mass of the universe, would be expelled in the resulting explosion as
<br>
mass-loss resulted in the loss of gravitational confinement.
<br>
<p>8. This 2.7% would come out as neutron star matter and decay into the 2.7%
<br>
of the now observed 3% heavy element content of the universe, the remaining
<br>
0.3% being formed later by stragglers and more recent supernovas.
<br>
<p>9. The proposal removes the so-called &quot;bounce problem&quot; having to with
<br>
understanding how supernovas work in detail. (It is presently proposed that
<br>
this comes about from turbulence -- a catch-all.) Actually, the mass loss
<br>
that happens at the end of the black hole formation when the mass vanished
<br>
into the vacuum results in a loss of gravitational confinement in the
<br>
supercompressed left-over neutron star.
<br>
<p>10. There happens to be a gap in the way super-massive stars behave when
<br>
they collapse. This gap comes between 500,000 solar masses and 750,000 solar
<br>
masses. The result is that the distribution of the gamma ray bursters would
<br>
be bi-modal. This is an otherwise unexplained aspect of the observed data
<br>
for gamma ray bursters.
<br>
<p>This is hardly exhaustive. I
<br>
could go into further details of the Robertson-Walker-Friedmann model of
<br>
general relativity and how that mathematics gives rise to these effects and
<br>
the development of the universe, but more of that can be found and read at
