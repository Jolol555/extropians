Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>Physical Immortality is a new magazine being produced by The Society for Venturism.  Our goal is to get it distributed throughout the United States and beyond.  Through this and other initiatives we aim to change public attitudes about extreme life extension and to even save lives.  
<br>
<p>I have been appointed the managing editor and I hope to do all I can to advance this important project.  And so I ask everyone on the list to consider subscribing.   
<br>
<p>To give some incentive to everyone, I will even send a free sample copy to those who request it.  Please just remember that this is our first issue and we definitely plan to improve the appearance as time goes on.  But this is not to say I am not proud of what we have so far accomplished.
<br>
<p>We are also looking for submissions and I would ask anyone interested to try their hand at it.  
<br>
<p>My life has definitely taken some amazing turns since leaving Alaska for Arizona!
<br>
<p>very best wishes,
<br>
<p>John Grigg

Blah, Blah, Blah!! : )

<br>
<p>It is time for all people who wish to live in a better world which readily accepts life extension research and cryonics to band together and work to make this a concrete reality.  The Society for Venturism is raising up its banners to share with the world our exciting message which aims for the achievement of physical immortality.  Our initial plans are to help our members be interviewed in the mass media, develop a major new magazine, and to have the membership advantage of sharing our beliefs from the forum of an organization that does not profit when someone gets suspended.  
<br>
<p>We will do the first aim by engaging radio and TV talk shows and offer up Venturist members to be interviewed - long and often.  We hope to flood the talk shows and news shows with interviews of reasonable Venturist members who are willing to persuade others to &quot;take the venture to the future.&quot;   If you remember, we chose the word &quot;Venturist&quot; because a &quot;venture&quot; is an adventure with some risk.  That is what cryonics is about.
<br>
<p>We will spread the cryonics message by building the Venturist Magazine into a publication that can be sold in news stands and will be attractive and informative.  Starting with the July 1st issue the Venturist magazine will come out every month.  
<br>
<p>Our unique organization lets others do suspensions and storage, while we concentrate on getting our message out to the world.  This is so there is no perceived financial gain for us as cryonics grows.  The benefits of our work will go to others.
<br>
<p>So far we have discussed building the membership, doing radio and TV talk shows, and building the magazine and trying to get it up to standards where it can be sold in news stands.  After we have progressed in this direction we can implement other benefits to immortalists like:  Personal trusts to take it ($) with you;  a back-up rescue option in case the patient's primary storage company gets in trouble;  meetings and seminars here at the Creekside Preserve.
<br>
<p>And in time Ventureville, our cryonics community planned for development in Mayer, will become a reality as our numbers grow.  This will not happen overnight, but in time we will have houses, apartments and a lodge center to be a beacon to cryonicists everywhere who want to gather together to work on Venturist goals and also to look after each other.  
<br>
<p>People who use reason to seek their own advantage and do so without harming others, and in fact help others in the process they select to obtain those advantages, are the most noble and honorable.  And that is what you will be doing with other fine people when you join the society for Venturism.  Each time the Venturists help motivate another person to sign up for cryonics, the existing cryonics population is strengthened by adding more members and the new person is helped by having the personal protection of being signed up for cryonics.  Therefore, every time you help someone else through cryonics you are also helping those who are already signed up and those who are already in suspension.  Working to increase membership in the cryonics movement is truly a win-win situation.
<br>
<p>By becoming a member you will be taking part in a great undertaking which will change for the better the world we live in.  Come embark on the adventure!    
<br>
