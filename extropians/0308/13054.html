But to continue harping on it and whining about it and trying to further

<br>
<p>Natasha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don't ban me from the list -- I sent my resignation in nearly a 
<br>
week ago.  You said, &quot;Mike got a warning for attacks and he continued.  He 
<br>
was removed.&quot;  Mike made some attacks based on matters of opinion, etc. but they 
<br>
were kept on the level of content.  Any personal comments he ever made pale 
<br>
compared to the personal attacks conducted by others or if compared to the 
<br>
chortling that occured on this list when he was banned.  Let me make it plain, 
<br>
compared to his critics the man has been a gentleman.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also said, &quot;If this is a problem for anyone on this list, either 
<br>
deal with it or not.  But to continue harping on it and whining about it and 
<br>
trying to further problems,...&quot;  I have dealt with it.  So have a number of 
<br>
others -- in one fashion or another we have departed because the uneven handling 
<br>
of the list has sickened us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why am I replying?  Because I consider it despicable to continue 
<br>
attacking Mike in his absence.  As he isn't here to defend himself I have spoken 
<br>
on his behalf.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, do your worse.
<br>
