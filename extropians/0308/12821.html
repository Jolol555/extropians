<em>&gt; &gt;  the limit on this line of reasoning though, is in the duration of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the act .... for instance, say you were prescient, and saw a man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who was going to mug you (with a knife) 10 minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from now, and hit him over a head; then you would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acting morally (given ur prescience).  Lets say you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not prescient, and you hit  him over the head on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibility that he might mug you; than you are acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immorally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; In the real world, where our moral judgement is supposed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assist us, (or at least that is my contention) we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *never* fully prescient and so there is always *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance the suspected or likely mugger may not in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mug us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; perhaps; in real life, I generally prepare for the attack, rather
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; than instigate a pre-emptive attack.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; There a couple of ramifications to this. First you leave your
<br>
opponent with more degrees of freedom and more power than if you take
<br>
the initiative. So you take on more risk. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; hardly; practically speaking, it means knowing when to attack, and
<br>
when not to attack (based on your enemies movements).
<br>
It is a fallacy to think that because you are reacting you are
<br>
necessarily @ a weaker advantage; more often than not the
<br>
one moving with &quot;more degrees of freedom&quot; is at the disadvantage because
<br>
so little is known (certain).  I just started
<br>
reading sun tzu (a recent translation) the art of war, and I am
<br>
impressed with the clarity of his understanding of warfare.
<br>
he reaches a similar conclusion; that most warfare is decided prior to
<br>
the actual conflict, generally by skillful manipulation
<br>
of the situation (by a talented general) and by not rushing foolishly
<br>
into a situation where there are too many unknowns.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Second would you not agree that the circumstances change when
<br>
one has others under ones authority or 
<br>
control like a leader, a military commander, or a president who has to
<br>
be able to think in terms of minimising loss 
<br>
of life sometimes when the other is clearly intending on taking life.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; no :) I run my life like I would run an army :) that is to say that
<br>
my personal decisions affect all those
<br>
around me, and so, I take my actions seriously.  I take pains to avoid
<br>
unnecessary suffering, intentional
<br>
or otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Assuming one values oneself, how can we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise than weigh up the chances as best we can?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My answer - we can't. Therefore the point becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how best we can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; learn to recognize (and avoid) abuse and abusive behaviors..  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that includes learning not to abuse others in an attempt to prevent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said abuse.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Where this works and it often would its laudable. Sometimes
<br>
though the abusive behavior cannot be avoided. Such is the human
<br>
condition. Some folks will go out of their way to remove the option of
<br>
avoiding them.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I'll agree with this statement; but they're attempt to impose their
<br>
presence on you despite your attempts to avoid them is in and of itself
<br>
a declarative action;
<br>
I have no problem scratching an itch, preferably with a 10 pound
<br>
sledgehammer.  I hate dealing with annoyances.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; The irony of being free is that others are two and the person
<br>
who decides to compete or predate on one immediately reduces ones
<br>
degrees of freedom. The reactor has less practical choices than the
<br>
actor. The actor can compete, cooperate or ignore. The reactor can be
<br>
forced to compete (or be defeated), cooperate or not, but hardly ignore
<br>
a person determined to compete.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; hahaha :) I think that this is a fundamental difference between me
<br>
and 
<br>
other people; I believe you can sedate the things you hate; others do
<br>
not.  Its
<br>
come up on several occassions.... Suffice it to say that in my case, I
<br>
never ever
<br>
have to deal with people I don't want to deal with (law
<br>
enforcement/violent
<br>
crime excepted sans prep time).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; At this point I think its worth distinguishing between a moral
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; code, which may be a preconsidered framework that one uses to help 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach a particular moral judgement and moral judgements per se.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; There are *no* moral codes that provide definitive answers to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the moral dilemmas that arise just as there are no maps on a scale
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; of 1:1, therefore whenever a particular moral judgement is required 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no dodging that the subjective individual must make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which or without the benefit of a more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated moral code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I see things in black and white;  I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a particularly sophisticated moral code; just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated world-view.  The rules themselves are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite easy.  I might add that you can generate a complex world view 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an array of black/white values... and if it is a matter of black 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and white values, then my moral code does have a 1-to-1 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspondence.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Then if you've codified to 1-to-1 (ie. predecided what you
<br>
will do in all possible moral dilemnas) then can the future
<br>
not throw you a curly one at all that will require you to
<br>
make a new judgement?
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt;  It isn't predecided; it is partitioned what is good
<br>
and what is bad in reference too different axis; the
<br>
actual selection of my own responses happens according
<br>
to a simple ruleset that operates on these states.  So throwing
<br>
me into different situations isn't a big deal; I'll identify whether
<br>
or not the situation sucks (by my standards), what available options
<br>
are there (from my skillset, materials, and the environment), what the
<br>
projected state would be for each of those actions, and whether or
<br>
not they would satisfy my own needs (which may or may not depending
<br>
on the severity of my situation, include the welfare of others) or that
<br>
of others.  practically speaking, I am very rarely thrust into
<br>
situtations
<br>
that can't be analyzed as such and yield a satisfactory action.  In
<br>
fact,
<br>
I am fully capable of generating (apparent) conflicting actions when
<br>
dealing with seperate parties which are in reality, united under a
<br>
general
<br>
operating principle..  Generally such instances are preceded by, &quot;if I
<br>
was
<br>
in your shoes...&quot;  The closest I come to moral crisis is what I would
<br>
term
<br>
&quot;games&quot;;  generally they are very abstract points that have not had 
<br>
resolution yet based on my experiences;  they fundamentally alter the
<br>
set of possible outcomes :)
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; For instance say that IVF technology was improved to
<br>
the point that a given embryo was more likely to go
<br>
through to a health birth than the more than 70% from
<br>
memory that naturally abort.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; What would be your moral position if you were a
<br>
superior court judge and a state governement wanted
<br>
to pass a law that all reproduction should be via IVF
<br>
as that wasted less embryos than reproduction by the
<br>
natural method. Would your moral code cover that
<br>
- with the consequence that all sex for pleasure must
<br>
involve careful steps to avoid reckless and risky
<br>
procreation or would you have to think anew guided
<br>
by your moral code perhaps but not being able to do
<br>
a one to one look up to say point 356 of your specific
<br>
code?
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; it depends; are you asking me as a person,
<br>
or me as a citizen responsible for crafting
<br>
policy to be inflicted (and I choose inflicted
<br>
on purpose) on others...
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; if you ask me as a person; I would say present
<br>
your evidence and I *may* choose to do as u wish;
<br>
in this case I am *already* planning on procreating
<br>
through IVF :)   If you ask me as a citizen crafting
<br>
policy, I would say, nobody has a right to limit how
<br>
you choose to procreate, short of physical rape (e.g.
<br>
date rape is crap IMHO).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Lets say you are not prescient, and he is mugging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone else (as it is apparent to you from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vantage point), and you intervene by hitting him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over the head... Then you're actions may or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not be immoral, on the basis that he may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the one doing the mugging, but rather, may be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; muggee.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Actually I'd say in the circumstances you describe the person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *has* acted morally, but with poor judgement, so poor in fact that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they may be found to have acted illegally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; you would; I would not; the reason being that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper action is to act to separate them, without harming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one party or the another precisely because you are ill-informed.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Hmm. I'm around 6 foot, weight around 90 kilo and
<br>
am a former state karate champion. Yet there are some
<br>
males that are so much stronger than me that I would not
<br>
be able to separate them as you say. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; we have a saying in egyptian; &quot;the army teaches
<br>
you to improvise&quot;.... can't seperate them, locate
<br>
resources that will enable you to seperate them;
<br>
this may be police, threatening to run them both down
<br>
if they don't stop, or calling for nearby passengers :)
<br>
I am a firm believer that the reason why life sucks is
<br>
that most people do not do their duty in establishing a
<br>
reasonable operating environment;  sometimes the police
<br>
are not available, and you have a duty in ceasing harmful
<br>
activities in progress.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Yet as a third
<br>
party coming onto the scene with them grappling with
<br>
other I would in all likelihood be able to render on or
<br>
the other unconscious having the advantage of the
<br>
element of surprise (as indeed could my youngest
<br>
sister, who is much lighter and has no special training
<br>
in any martial arts, if she kept her wits about her).
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Your scenario contains details for you that I didn't
<br>
see. Those details change the context. One must
<br>
act in real time within the context with the options
<br>
that one has. If the two protagonists were school
<br>
boys then separating them might be relatively easy
<br>
and involve only words. It depends.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; well I've been thrust into that situation on several
<br>
occassions :) and I've never had a problem... granted
<br>
no weapons were involved.  That also included random
<br>
strangers btw :)  The point is to stop the escalation
<br>
without being partial to either of the combatants, because
<br>
you realize that you are *NOT* in full possession of the 
<br>
facts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You should have a duty (under your moral code)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to negotiate in good faith, and having said that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have an obligation to do due diligence in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to (as completely as possible) understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the situation.  Properly exercised restraint is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarkeably under-appreciated quality.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Agreed. But &quot;due&quot; diligence depends on the
<br>
circumstances. Too much diligence, too much
<br>
forebearance is also a risk. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; agreed; there is a time for action; I would say
<br>
err on the side of too much diligence than too less.
<br>
The beauty of it is, though, that with more experience
<br>
enforcing a rigid structure as such, the better you as
<br>
an individual will be in recognizing (gauging accurately)
<br>
exactly when you have reached that point of due 
<br>
diligence :)  I believe that the worst thing you can do as
<br>
a person (both for yourself (directly, and indirectly) and others)
<br>
is adopt an inconsistent enforcement of any particular policy.
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; The weighting of the
<br>
risks is a moral judgement that the individual
<br>
cannot get away from as no code can fully
<br>
anticipate all contingencies.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I shift the preponderance of the work towards
<br>
establishing the environment you are in (accurately);
<br>
so my moral code is simple and complete :) [ergo sophisiticated 
<br>
world-view statement above].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you can't have a good moral code if you're judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is consistently unable to judge according to that moral code..
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I think I see your point. A better code, one that endorses
<br>
reasoning rather than believing as a means to making decisions, is a
<br>
better guide to moral behavior, but we can never have a code so good
<br>
that the need for moral judgments disappear altogether unless there are
<br>
no new challenges thrown at us, like the challenges that technologies
<br>
might throw up.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; its more basic than that; its an age-old systems problem; if a
<br>
system is theoretically perfect, but always implemented poorly (due to
<br>
agent errors),
<br>
can it really be considered theoretically perfect?  would not a system
<br>
that inherently compensated for agent errors be even better?  What if
<br>
you 
<br>
could implement this uber-algorithm, but couldn't gaurantee its
<br>
compensations... would you still consider it theoretically perfect
<br>
because it
<br>
explicity addressed the tendency towards agent (human) error and sought
<br>
to correct them?  What if you could gaurantee that system did
<br>
[eventually] correct said behaviors, but no time frame was given in
<br>
regards to its convergence to optimal corrections, would be even better 
<br>
than ur uber-algorithm?  All important aspects to be considered when
<br>
choosing to adopt or reject any particular moral system....
<br>
<p><p>&lt;brett&gt; [snip]... But the brighter more abstract thinkers that are
<br>
likely to rise to positions of power are more likely to be better
<br>
abstract thinkers and reasoners. (They may also be better rationalizers
<br>
on occassion but a rationalization is a deceit one practices on
<br>
oneself). Your rationalisation won't convince me and vice versa. You or
<br>
I can have a moral discussion and seek to change each others views using
<br>
reason and a common language but if either of us held that we were
<br>
absolutely right to believe what we believe then there would be little
<br>
possibility of communication and cooperation between us.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; first; I would say that abstract thinkers do not have a tendency to
<br>
rise to positions of power anymore than anyone else;
<br>
second; I would say it depends on whether or not the agent &quot;thinking
<br>
that they were absolutely right&quot; thought that naturally
<br>
implied that the search for disproof was pointless or not... for
<br>
instance, if you asked me to hold a conversation on
<br>
whether or not 2+2 = 4 in decimal arithmetic as its currently defined, I
<br>
would probably not choose to engage in such a
<br>
conversation; if you asked me if 2+2 = 4 in all cases, I would, because
<br>
their you *may* be talking about some unifying principle
<br>
irrespective of any particular algebra (ergo 2+2 may not be equal to 4
<br>
in all cases is a true (and absolutely correct) statement,
<br>
but you may be discussing a particular aspect of it that may be at a
<br>
higher level than the statement itself).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;If one is running around in 2003 holding that the 10 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commandments are all the moral code that is needed one is going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up against some particularly curly challenges in interpreting how
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; to operationalise the directive that though shalt not kill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;Even this simple edict is subject to interpretation. Life in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2003 is known to take place on more than the organismic level. Cells 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are alive. And human cancer cells are human life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; sure if you don't consider that human cancer cells replicate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through meisos rather than fertilization. of course (and this would be
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; VERY interesting); what would happen if a cancer colony was able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate say sperm.... would it be considered life... intriguing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;Clearly it is absurb to argue that a cancer cell or a multiples
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; of them are of moral weight with a person dying of cancer. Yet this is
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; not much of an exaggeration beyond the proposition that say all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embryos are a form of human life when by human life what is obviously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant is personhood.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; trust me, I understand the distinction between women as life
<br>
support
<br>
for a fetus and a fetus as collection of foreign cells in a parasitic
<br>
arrangement
<br>
with its hosts :)  suffice it to say that in certain cases, a cancer
<br>
cell may
<br>
actually be more valuable than the host it is living on... but that
<br>
follows
<br>
from my (reasonable) assumption that we're all going to die anyway :)
<br>
For instance, there is a line of skin cells that are cancerous that are
<br>
actually harvested for skin grafts on burn victims.. they are
<br>
particularly
<br>
interesting because they don't raise any immune response from
<br>
individuals
<br>
(thus making them extremely valuable for their intended use).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I say tear it out of the womb and see if it survives unaided.  if
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; it does, boom, human being.  if it doesn't, well then, at best it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an incomplete human being who died.  There is no inherent reason to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relegate women to the equivalent of biological life carriers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before laws can be set that codify legally what may and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be done it is prudent to have a moral disucssion where the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words we use do not obfuscate the reals issues at hand. Issues such as
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; how does a civil society weight the rights or potential persons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (embryos, fetus etc at different stages). When we do not decide or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address these questions public policy continues to be made on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basis of outdated moral and legal codes. And persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer needlessly.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I would agree :)  ergo my suggestion for a clear, unambivalent
<br>
test,
<br>
tending towards reserving the right for any person to make their own
<br>
moral decisions rather than a state.  If it lives, its a human being...
<br>
if it dies, it is not.  If god wanted it to be considered a human being,
<br>
he would have helped it live :)  I see no conflict between that and any
<br>
of the traditional moral codes currently running amok.  God never said,
<br>
thou shalt not maim; he said, thou shalt not kill.  Any damage done to
<br>
the fetus after being ripped out of the womb would be incidental to
<br>
the &quot;moral&quot; &lt;smirk&gt; ethic currently employed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; Oh I would agree :) regarding a code of laws being unduly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influenced by any one particular moral code. Personally, I don't think
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; laws should attempt to legislate morality.  It is up to people to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Yes. And if we consider that each of us is a person
<br>
we get to &quot;to thine ownself be true&quot;.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; well we agree on that part :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Do you think there is a moral sphere separate from the legal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere? Some apparently don't. I think the legal sphere is smaller 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the morals sphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I think the two are completely seperate systems; that is not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say a legal code cannot borrow from an established moral code (or vice
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; versa in cases where moral codes are not derived from an unchangeable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word of god).
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Agreed. Interestingly though legal systems do seem to put a
<br>
higher or more 
<br>
formal emphasis on reasoning and the processes by which conclusions are 
<br>
reached. 
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; thats incidental; legal systems generally attempt to be
<br>
accountable; that requires consistency,
<br>
and consistency can only come from particular formal systems (past
<br>
draconion kill everyone statements) :)
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Juries work to beyond &quot;reasonable&quot; doubt standards not to mere
<br>
&quot;belief&quot;.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; but fundamentally juries decision of reasonable doubt or not is a
<br>
belief on their parts..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In relation to your secondary point (stated in this letter); I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; really don't think morality has anything necessarily to do with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-delusion, or the acknowledgement thereof. Or rather, there is
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; no truth that states necessarily you  have to be honest, ergo an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; act
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of dishonesty (as it relates to self-delusion) does not violate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; any particularly great truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; First the status of morality and the rationality of ethics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is pretty widely regarded at least so far as I am aware in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; philosophical circles as being almost a matter of opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (eg. Bertrand Russell. History of Western Philosophy).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I'm sure it is; until you run into an event that requires faith
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; or belief outside of rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Actually I think BR would hold the line even in the face of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your example. But BR overlooked a few things as Godel pointed out. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe he abandoned the search for a rational ethics too early.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I never read BR so I can't really comment on his particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical bent. my circuit on philosophy keeps getting delayed; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't stand wading through stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats no relevant (given my stripped down operating assumptions).  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think someday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll get bored enough to get to the juicy parts [probably in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condensed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of all the philosophies].
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Its been argued that all academic disciplines are descendants of
<br>
philosophy. 
<br>
I am interested in philosophy not because it it esoteric though it can
<br>
be but 
<br>
because it can suggest solutions to problems.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; historically speaking, likely :) theoretically speaking, math is
<br>
more important than 
<br>
philosophy (IMHO, but only because I would like to be accurate) :)  I'm
<br>
interested
<br>
in philosophy in that I think philosophy is a commoners pursuit just as
<br>
much as its
<br>
an academics or nobles.   Or rather it *should* be :)  As it is
<br>
practiced now, most
<br>
philosophy discussions end up invoking the thoughts of long-dead people
<br>
rather
<br>
than concentrating on using available resources (cognitive, historical)
<br>
to identify
<br>
key problems.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; put another way, I would rather talk to a person who has rederived
<br>
the philosophers
<br>
works independantly, rather than someone who has adopted them based on
<br>
extensive
<br>
reading of said philosophers (and ergo, has not really contributed to
<br>
them).
<br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; My interest in morality and ethics for instance pretty much goes
<br>
back to a desire to 
<br>
build stronger societies and more effective cooperatives because in this
<br>
way I can do more, 
<br>
be more and enjoy doing it better.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; for me it was a search for policy :) it is an active attempt to
<br>
remove the crap currently
<br>
floating in my environment (from my point of view, of course) :)
<br>
<p><p>&lt;brett&gt; On the specific point I would say that my code would
<br>
say that self delusion is immoral. Thats what I'd endeavor
<br>
to teach children but I'd also point out that its nature
<br>
and in some circumstances moral judgements that take
<br>
in the fuller context and detail than any moral code
<br>
(that is codified) are going to be refinements.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; I would endeavor to teach children above all else, make sure its
<br>
functional;
<br>
always search for an objective measure to test for ur situation, and
<br>
alwas attempt
<br>
to find optimal solutions that do not unnecesarily inflict needless
<br>
suffering for
<br>
others, nor impose needless limitations on urself.  And have fun :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and yes, you can make a decision to hallucinate...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same as you can wake up (out of the equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of a dream) when you are rescued.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; Perhaps we have different concepts of what
<br>
constitutes an hallucination. I don't think
<br>
fantasy = hallucination. I think hallucination is 
<br>
likely to have a medical/physiological cause and 
<br>
not be volitional.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; hallucinations may have a physiological cause;
<br>
however they are not necessarily the only cause.  There
<br>
is a whole subfield of perception devoted to determining
<br>
how u think affects (internal mental states) how you perceive
<br>
stimulus...  If you can manipulate your own (or anothers) 
<br>
internal environment, you can achieve real hallucinations 
<br>
(equivalent to one that is induced by a somatic condition, or drug).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether it would in fact yeild the best outcome for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you is not the point  as the  facts of the outcome are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not knowable to you at the time you decide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I would say that they are; I would say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only reason to willing self-delude yourself via fantasy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever is specifically because you have examined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the outcomes and decided that reality sucked and you could do better.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;brett&gt; I see. You are interchanging fantasy and self-delusion. I
<br>
tend to think of fantasy as suspension of disbelief. One
<br>
knows one is doing it and one is doing it for fun.
<br>
<p>&lt;me&gt; no :) I'm not :) I'm saying that some people can subsume themselves
<br>
into their fantasies, effectively hallucinating.
<br>
<p><p><p>Self-delusion on the other hand - one probably suspects
<br>
one is doing it at some level unless ones rational aspects
<br>
are completely shut down - but delusons I think of as
<br>
things we don't have for fun, but for other perhaps
<br>
more serious pyschological basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would say that you would end up having to constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (subconsciously)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moniter reality to decide when you would come out of ur protective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Now thats the moral code. The reason for the moral code is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that usually judgements will be required in real life which one cannot
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; anticipate and the better, the more sophisticated your moral code the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, (the more enlightened) your judgement of your own best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; again I balk at the requirement for a sophisticated moral code; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can have an incredibly simple moral code; but apply it through the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; use of a sophisticated world view (ergo ur judgement).
</em><br>
<p>A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs scale (the
<br>
simplest) may not do something that is good for society in general but
<br>
for far more basic reasons, than a person who is reasoning at level 5.
<br>
<p>But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or abstraction
<br>
and nuance are likely to influence your code. I would think that a
<br>
person would have a hard time having a complex moral code without having
<br>
the ability to use language for instance.
<br>
<p>Our leaders must make judgements that will have impacts
<br>
on lives other than their own. The more of us that are reasoners and
<br>
critical thinkers and the fewer of us that are mere believers the better
<br>
(the healthier) we will be as a society in my opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; In this particular case I don't think there is much latitude 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for  immoral action as you really would be alone on  the desert island
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; in the situation you stipulate. Of course the situation you stipulate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not  arise. One would never know one was going to be marooned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for sixty years AND CHOOSE to hallucinate. Hallucinations for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the most part are going to be dysfunctional even on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; .. for the most part?
</em><br>
<p>Fair catch that does look like a slippery phrase doesn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and I do dispute ur choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hallucinate;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-hypnosis?
</em><br>
<p>No. I am an open minded sceptic when it comes to
<br>
conventional hypnosis. I have never experienced it
<br>
and those that I have seen ostensibly hypnotised on
<br>
stage seemed to me to be substantially &quot;hamming&quot;
<br>
or playing it up for the attention. I think some of
<br>
us sometimes like not having to be analytical all
<br>
the time and to have others tell us what to do
<br>
and just follow alone can be pleasant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can get urself into a deep enough trance, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-hypnotic suggestions that trigger when you wake... including the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post hypnotic suggestion to renew itself until you are rescued.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can cause hallucinations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a deep enough trance btw.  And thats not even calling upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mystics, or people who have sufficiently advanced manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques...
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if I can get into a trance as you put it. I guess I can its
<br>
just not something I am very familiar with.
<br>
<p>I suppose when it comes to my mind I am a bit of a control freak, I
<br>
don't like it when the captain is not on the bridge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I tend towards a function and dysfunctional definition of sanity; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if its dysfunctional, then you are not being ethical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; This seems to be confounding sanity with ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not really :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Which is problematic if the insane cannot make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound judgements in their own interests by virtue of being insane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ergo my distinction between function and dysfunctional insanity.
</em><br>
<p>Is there a functional form of insanity? As I understand it insanity is
<br>
usually diagnosed on the basis of behavior. If is inferred rather than
<br>
experimentally verified. Insanity is apparently easy to fake. Sanity on
<br>
the other hand - now theres a challlenge :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  if its functional, you are being ethical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and since functionality is related to the environment you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; operating in, ergo my comment about self-delusion not really having 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything to do with morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I definately think everyone is engaged in it to some degree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (self-delusion), and to the extent that it helps you, its ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; So do I. The human condition is mortal. It would hardly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behoove us to dwell on it excessively and abandon hope when there was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none. Perhaps the illusion of a life after death only becomes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dysfunctional when it gets in the way of the realisation of longer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life in practice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; In the vast majority of cases self-delusion *is* going to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmful. In those circumstances where it is not harmful to anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the person who is self-deluded then I'd agree it not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immoral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ok well then we've settled that line of logic :)
</em><br>
<p>Hooray :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; I find this conclusion (Bertrand Russell's) powerful, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangerous and deeply unsatisfying so I am keen to have at it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I was just telling my little sister yesterday about one of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classical issues in my life (at one point during my younger years); 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what point does being too intelligent start to harm you (the classic
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; form being, if you could trade intelligence for gauranteed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness, would you do it)... most intelligent people say no; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think the really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent people though, when they consider it, say yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I think this is pure speculation. Would a less intelligent you
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; be you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; does it make a difference if you are gauranteed to be happy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; If you think so there may be possibilites for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to chart a life for yourself that involves more happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and less intellect. But personally I don't think so. How do you aim at
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; happiness without identifying something that will make you happy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Happiness is not itself a thing that can be persued.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ergo my point :) if you can't gaurantee happiness by method of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, and some mythical blue genie (whom to the best of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities to discern is capable of granting) is willing to gaurantee 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ur happiness at the cost of your intelligence than any sane, rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person of sufficient intellect would not think twice.  This assumes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that everyone wants to be happy[maiximized utility table]... which I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think is an unreasonable...
</em><br>
<p>I must be failing to follow what you mean by maximizing your utility
<br>
table of something because it still seems to me that happiness cannot
<br>
really be a target that one aims at it is a consequence that arise as a
<br>
desired and hoped for side effect of something else one aims at.
<br>
<p>There is a saying &quot;man is the only animal that laughs
<br>
and weeps, because he is the only animal that sees
<br>
what is, and what might have been&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course, assumes that people intuitively seek to maximize their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; utilities, and said maximization of utility defines a state of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happiness [which is, I think, reasonable]...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I don't I think its premature at best and problematic at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst. One cannot be happy without a cause. Happiness per se is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuable. Pleasure is. Lesser levels of sentience are. But I doubt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are what appeal to you as an alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; take a look at a little kid sometime :)
</em><br>
<p>Hey I grew up in a catholic family - I've seen the old
<br>
kid of two :-)
<br>
<p>I reckon they are very active little hypothesis testers
<br>
and experimenters. Just because we may look in from
<br>
the outside an think they are &quot;playing&quot; doesn't change
<br>
that they are playing at something. If they are happy
<br>
playing they probably declared they were going out
<br>
to play (something specific) rather than going out to
<br>
be happy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip happiness is a sideeffect&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any moral system you build on that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; premise is doomed to fail because it does not take into account 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions by that subpopulation of people (antisocial individuals who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are operating on a different ethical system).  I would state that ur
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; assumption that there is a propensity to reason is a reasonable one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is necessary for the ability to recognize other autonomous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agents actions for what they are; expressions of their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral/ethical systems..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Ah I think you missed my point. The potential to persuade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the sociability aspect *is* far stronger when individuals are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerless and my point is that the all those who are mortal are now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *aware*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they possess a poor form of wealth and power if it can't extend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their life and health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ... and these are the only people you're interested in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaching?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah only all those who are *mortal*  and have a self-interest ;-)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; There is an opportunity there to get them to revisit the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social compact. But these cagey old survivers will not fall for bs. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When arguments are put to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are not in their interest they will not buy into them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; its been my experience that people who are very wealthy  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally don't  give a shit about social compact.  They got (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  preserve) their wealth at the cost of other individuals...  I would  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that you need to put it in terms that involve greed.
</em><br>
<p>Well self interest will do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; So in my view a moral argument cannot be put to a rich or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful individual unless it is couched in terms of offering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *something* for them. We live in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historic period. In this  period it might be possible to promote a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy of more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life for all or more life for none.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; good luck getting the rich to give a shit about the poor (past 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones  making off with their valuables)....
</em><br>
<p>No I'd aim to get the rich to care more effectively for the rich by
<br>
recognizing their relationship with the poor. My emphasis is not be
<br>
charitable to the poor my emphasis is on how would you life be better if
<br>
the poor were not so poor? If they had more to loose. If they were able
<br>
to cooperate with you to make both you and them wealthier in absolute
<br>
terms rather than relative terms.
<br>
<p>Would you rather be healthy and active at 130 or have a
<br>
very expensive funeral and a prestigiously looking burinal
<br>
plot at 80?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The alternative may be cabals of the powerful working to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'immortalise' themselves. Such a scenario may restart &quot;history&quot; whose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demise was greatly exaggerated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; probably :) I hope to be part of a successful cabal :) but only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if quality of life is high...
</em><br>
<p>Beware the dark side Luke :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Further those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who do not know endeavour to understand themselves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what manner of creature they are, are not going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a position to know what the most optimal compromises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for them are when compromises need to be made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I've met several people who are extremely intuitively, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to verbalize (form coherent sentences) expressing their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewpoints...they just know what is right for them, and what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how does your system encompass them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; They learn to reason and they learn to use language to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They learn to understand what they want. This gives them the best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance to make their way and improve their situation as they go. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not guarantee them success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;omd&gt; and if the overall performance of this new system ends up being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse than their intuitive model? what then?
</em><br>
<p>I have no magic. If my moral code is adopted by others it will because
<br>
they see merit in it. If they see merit in it and I see merit in it I'm
<br>
prepared to work on the assumption that their is merit in it. - That a
<br>
bit simplistic but this thread is very long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The universe in which hard work  gurantees success is not this
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; one in my view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;omd&gt; work smarter, not harder has always been my motto...
</em><br>
<p>Makes sense. But leveraging your efforts with others can be a
<br>
particularly effective way of working smart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; A person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that deludes themselves that they are a different sort of creature 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with different sets of drivers and needs than they actually have is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; precluded from sitting down at table to negotiate for their own best
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; interests because they do not know their own best interests. A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person that deludes themselves willingly can hardly be a person that
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; others would want to engage in a moral compacts with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; according to you :) to me its fine :) In fact, i rather like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space cadets :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It not the space cadets that you have to worry about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Its the wizened old cynics and manipulators that figure that life is
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; a bitch and that they are not going to join the ideological idiocy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of submission. These guys have the power to fuck up all your plans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and irronically shortchange themselves in their cynicism too. They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not greedy enough for life (according to this theory). There is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a fatal foolishness in their cynicism. They may be happy to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ten more years of power in the forms that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become accustomed too. They may rate their progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not against what it possible but against how big a differenc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is between them and the common man.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; that is common btw; in people from all walks of life (competition
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; versus a neighbor) versus global competition... it seems (given the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadness) that it is inherent to peoples point of views... besides 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the trick to manipulations is to learn how to do it urself.
</em><br>
<p>I think your right it comes to us naturally. But what also comes
<br>
naturally to us homo-saps is reasoning. We can see that win wins are
<br>
possible, that it is possible through cooperation to do what we cannot
<br>
do alone. We can choose to measure ourselves against what is possible
<br>
rather than against each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The logical consequence of this line of thinking unchecked is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; formation of power cabals and starker separations between the haves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the have nots (in which ironically even the haves will have less
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; than they may have had).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; that assumes there is no such thing as a steady accretion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge in the hands of a few.  there is no reason to limit it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the life of any one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person (or collection); you can consider your lineage for instance.
</em><br>
<p>The few will be aware of the condition of the many, and some
<br>
of the few will be uneasy in their relationships with others of the few
<br>
if those others are too harsh or cruel in the treatment of the many. We
<br>
know well enough how easy it is to go from in-group to out-group.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip of antisocial/sociopathic stuff&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is where I think it becomes important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to acknowledge to oneself that one can be rational and that one is
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; by nature social. If one does not acknowledge that one is social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; one is not (by my reckoning) being true to oneself and one does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not have the sort of maturity that will enable one to be on good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; terms with oneself and to form real compacts that have a chance of
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; being honored with others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ooooh I don't know about that :)  You seem to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that people are by nature, social creatures.  I don't necessarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; think thats the case. Or to qualify, people are social by a matter
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of degree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Sure but there is a baseline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; go tell that to the unibomber.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I would have been happy to point out to the unibomber that he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was born social, so much so that he couldn't raise his head to feed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; granted :) but that doesn't really nullify the fact that he did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become extremely antisocial afterwards...
</em><br>
<p>Granted. But there is value in knowing why and how. The value is in the
<br>
power to identify route causes that can be changed. Lets go for the
<br>
disease not the symptom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Then I'd ask him where his sociability ended. It could be an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insightful conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; probably when he realized it was a losing game for his utility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tables...
</em><br>
<p>Or he may discover that he's been shortchanging his own self interest
<br>
with a suboptimal utility table.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some are quite capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of going it alone while others would die if seperated from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; herd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; None are capable of going it alone yet. But here is the point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the future we may re-engineer ourselves to such an extent that some
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; may indeed feel capable of going it alone. And these indivduals will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily be able to be reasoned with with the same starting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premises. These individuals may become meglomanical persuing as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culmination of their individuality dominance over all else. Because, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you have no empathy - why the hell not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; why not indeed?
</em><br>
<p>And therein lies the danger of the future. Rugged immortal
<br>
individualists fighting for supreme godhood in the universe.
<br>
<p>By why not? Seriously. I dunno but I figure god would be bored (and
<br>
lonely) well perhaps not lonely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Only after some initial basic social assistance has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rendered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; We're dealing with [dynamic] adults here, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You don't intend to limit your morality to only those who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently social?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nor do I intend to convert the bad eggs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to altruism. I see it as far more useful to persuade the good eggs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that if they do not want war with the bad eggs they had better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acknowledge that principle 101 for the bad egg is likely to be what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is in this for me. If there is not an answer to that question then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conflict will come about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Many infants get suboptimal social assistance and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outcomes are often dysfunctional people. But they are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dysfunctional  by choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; but they're still dysfunctional, at least, according to what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently  passes for a majority of society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yeah. And society pays the price. A more enlightened society might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better economies in avoiding the dysfunctional early socialisation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So i question ur assumption that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is social.... Its obviously a core belief in ur system, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; certes, generally speaking, it is the case that most people are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; social.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Everyone is social to a degree. Am I really saying that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is reachable through their residual sociability. I doubt it. I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature throws up dysfunctional types of all forms and some genuine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociopaths can probably only be dealt with as amoral threats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; watch some interviews with a sociopath :)  they're really quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascinating...  anyways, there's no reason to render a sociopath a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat; in fact, I'ld say they can be harnassed to detect flaws in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current modes.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I'm saying sociopath when I mean pyschopath.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But not all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Not all to the same degree. But there is no person alive at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; present (to the best of my knowledge) with the power to stay alive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without cooperating with others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; but you acknowledge that it is a possibility?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Yes. Imo that is a possibility. For me the interest in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality is linked to an interest in politics and in the means by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the possibility may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more become a probability in my life time. Hey I am social, but I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also rational, and I am in this for me :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I suggest you pick up a microscope and a centrifuge then :)
</em><br>
<p>These works better if you leave them stably sitting on the bench. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; It is not necessary that social be about niceness it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better, more funcitonal, if it is about an enlightened  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understanding of frailty and the benefits of cooperation.  I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argue that tyrants that aim for the short glorious  life of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Archilles in 2003 are short changing themselves.  They are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sub-optimally selfish. With a tweak of their value  systems they may
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; be able to satisfy more of their needs and desires by  cooperating. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But many of them  would have to re-learn and I'd expect few of them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to  change what has worked for them if they could not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; presented with a compelling argument. If there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compelling argument that can be made to their self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interest then I would say that no real moral argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  is being put to them at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; ....except to say that they have presumeably successfuly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfied their own utility tables....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; No they optimised. But I'd argue they have sold themselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short. They could and may in may cases yet achieve more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; perhaps, but they certainly won't be listening... if they're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfied, why change the status quo?
</em><br>
<p>Because they won't stay satisfied. How can you keep up
<br>
with or look down on the Jones if they've gone and
<br>
immortalised themselves?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ----------------------------------- SNIP, wait for part 2 :) damn this
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; is long :) --------------
</em><br>
<p>Bail at any time or edit with more extreme prejudice. The offer was
<br>
there in the last post.
<br>
<p>Quite seriously, long rambly dialogs are probably
<br>
better offlist. I think it was worth having the discussion
<br>
but maybe not on list.
<br>
<p>Any illuson I had that others might read much of this
<br>
have long past. But the upside is that the dialectic
<br>
process does help sort out thoughts. In this thread
<br>
somewhere are a few gems. They may be distilled
<br>
at a later date maybe.
<br>
<p>Regards,
