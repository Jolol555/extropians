<p>
Some years ago I read an article that talked about different measures of 
<br>
complexity and how well they applied to the age-old problem of classifying 
<br>
living vs non-living systems.
<br>
<p>I remember that for one measure there was a graph that showed an irregular 2D 
<br>
region in the middle that they claimed was the domain of life. Chaos was at 
<br>
one end of the graph and Order was at the other. Prions lay outside this 
<br>
'life region' while virii and dormant seeds lay on the edges.
<br>
<p>The trouble is that I don't remember the source of the article or much more 
<br>
than I've just related. Has this rung any bells for anyone? Or can someone 
<br>
point me in the right direction?  I've been digging through tons of online 
<br>
stuff about Complexity Theory, Self-Adaptive Systems, Artificial Life and the 
<br>
like without any luck yet.
