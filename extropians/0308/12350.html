<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/08/01/nutrients.reut/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/08/01/nutrients.reut/index.html</a>
<br>
<p>In a study that shows more than ever you are what you eat, scientists 
<br>
said on Friday they had changed the coat colors of baby mice simply by 
<br>
altering their mothers' diets. 
<br>
<p>Basically what they show is that by giving vitamins the expression of 
<br>
the agouit gene is turned down. Maternal diet also affects other gene 
<br>
expression, which is interesting. I may have mentioned earlier that 
<br>
maternal choline appears to improve spatial memory in mice.
<br>
<p>This opens up an interesting issue (and a rhetorical &quot;trick&quot;): is it
<br>
acceptable for mothers to tailor their diets to help or affect their
<br>
child? Many of the standard anti-genetic arguments seem to say no, which
<br>
would imply that mothers should not be allowed to deliberately eat food
<br>
rich in (say) choline, which makes for a good rhetorical reductio ad
<br>
absurdum. But if we accept that mothers may eat chocolate (rich in 
<br>
lecithine, which turns into choline) to improve their children but not 
<br>
any genetic interventions, what is the fundamental difference? Is it 
<br>
just gene expression changes that are OK? Again, it seems nature is not 
<br>
obliging us with any other answer than that a lot of effects during 
<br>
early development can affect the child profoundly; what we do with them 
<br>
and how we handle them ethically is up to us. There are no ready-made 
<br>
boundaries.
