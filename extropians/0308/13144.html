<p><em>&gt;Uh-oh.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;US Has World's Highest Incarceration Rate
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;By GAIL RUSSELL CHADDOCK
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;More than 5.6 million Americans are in prison or have served time there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;according to a new report by the Justice Department released Sunday. That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1 in 37 adults living in the United States, the highest incarceration
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level in the world.
</em><br>
<p><p>I guess this is a summertime news item? New stats for the
<br>
U.S. prison population get published.
<br>
<p>I mentions this because it was a large news item almost exactly one
<br>
year ago. I read all of those articles from last year.
<br>
(Politics _do_ make a difference for where I want to live )
<br>
<p>The Economist published an article about the U.S. prison stats
<br>
in the August 8, 2002 edition.

Justice in America
<br>
<p>Too many convicts
<br>
Aug 8th 2002
<br>
&nbsp;From The Economist print edition
<br>
<p><p>TODAY is a special day for 1,600 American men and women: they are
<br>
being released from a state or federal prison. Tomorrow will be a
<br>
special day for another 1,600 people. As will be the day after that.
<br>
Some 600,000 inmates will leave prison this year-more than the
<br>
population of Washington, DC. After quadrupling its imprisonment
<br>
rate in just 30 years-America now has 700 people in every 100,000
<br>
under lock and key, five times the proportion in Britain, the
<br>
toughest sentencer in Western Europe-the world's most aggressive
<br>
jailer must now confront the iron law of imprisonment: that those
<br>
who go in almost always come out.
<br>
<p>The result is a society that, statistically at least, is beginning
<br>
to look a little like early Australia. Nearly one in eight American
<br>
men has been convicted of a felony-and thus, in many states, has
<br>
been automatically deprived of numerous rights, including the right
<br>
to vote. One in 20 men has been to jail. [...]

<p><p>There was news at this link too:
<br>
August 25, 2002
<br>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/25/jail.stats/">http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/25/jail.stats/</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;U.S. correctional population  at record high&quot; ...
<br>
<p>At the time, one yr ago,I gathered some information on this topic
<br>
on the Web and found  some sources that said that U.S. has more
<br>
people in prison (per capita)  than Russia,  Belarus,  South Africa,
<br>
Thailand, England, China, France,  Italy, Japan and more.
<br>
<p>I was really bothered at the time, but I cannot confirm the above.
<br>
Unfortunately I'm in a time crunch for other things, I don't  have
<br>
time now to retrace my steps.
