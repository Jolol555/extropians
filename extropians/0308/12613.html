<p>
Taking a look at a couple of Max's short pieces, I
<br>
note his mention of the Gramein Bank - the micro-loans
<br>
program - as an example of how to be socially
<br>
conscious and profitable, or something like that - in
<br>
his BLOG on &quot;Why Marx Was Even More Wrong Than You
<br>
Thought.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm surprised on that note that Mondragon was not
<br>
mentioned.  The Mondragon Cooperative is a
<br>
world-class, outstanding business which breaks all the
<br>
prevalent business models. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.mondragon.mcc.es/">http://www.mondragon.mcc.es/</a>
<br>
<p>Of course, there are reasons:
<br>
<p>The &quot;Progressive (in a pig's eye! as progressive as
<br>
&quot;Pro-Life&quot; is...) Left&quot; won't talk about Mondragon
<br>
because they aren't a socialist model at all.  In fact
<br>
they came out of the Basque Anarcho-Syndicalist school
<br>
if anything, and they have never taken a penny of
<br>
state money or assitance that I know of and have never
<br>
hocked their future to any state bank, either.  So
<br>
there, stupid socialists!  Look at all the utter
<br>
failures of socialism.  Try to find a success, just
<br>
one, anywhere???  
<br>
<p>But Mondragon bootstrapped itself into being an
<br>
$8billion business, with its OWN bank, its OWN schools
<br>
and university, its OWN social security and health
<br>
coverage, ALL paid for voluntarily by its
<br>
worker/owners.  Ie., Mondragon is actually DOING all
<br>
the great social things that the socialists have been
<br>
holding up as an ideal.  Workers runing their own
<br>
businesses, themselves - Mondragon (NOT red China, or
<br>
Cuba, or the former Evil Empire).  What guns and
<br>
terror couldn't accomplish, hard-headed practical
<br>
business sense did with flourish and taste.
<br>
<p>And the Right (what, another total misnomer???  When
<br>
were they ever right about anything?) hates Mondragon
<br>
because Mondragon has succeeded spectacularly as a
<br>
profit-making business WITHOUT the top-down leadership
<br>
of megabuck-salaried brave captains of industry
<br>
leading the stupid workers.  NO.  The WORKERS RUN
<br>
MONDRAGON!  And they have ALL the benefits that the
<br>
socialist left wants, plus job security, plus high
<br>
wages, and they made a $250Million net profit last
<br>
year during a world-wide economic downturn, while
<br>
doing major worldwide community outreach, such as with
<br>
the Doctors Without Borders.
<br>
<p>so.  there.  
<br>
<p><p>Check it out.  ;)
