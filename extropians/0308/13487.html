<p>I think there are two problems here; (a) there are very few people trained
<br>
in the art of &quot;logical debate&quot; (making it difficult for logic to outweigh
<br>
emotions) -- thus &quot;name-calling and such&quot;; and (b) we are &quot;thin&quot; with respect
<br>
to the quantity of individuals who could seriously debate IA.  If you had
<br>
Anders and perhaps a few of his associates who attend neuroscience meetings
<br>
and combined them with people like Aubrey, Brett and their associates who
<br>
understand the technology and throw in people like Marvin Minsky or Eliezer
<br>
who have a great depth of knowledge in AI -- *then* one might get a really
<br>
interesting debate on IA.
<br>
<p>I don't know of a list with those aspects however.
