<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Samantha Atkins
</em><br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sorry but as long as the discussion remains civil I thought it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly fine to discuss political issues especially if they have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bearing on our abilities to accomplish our goals and retain our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work toward those goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you now requesting that I don't reply to your question asking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of where these laws are in fact dangerous to some of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental civil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberties?    I am confused by your getting so riled up
</em><br>
<p>Let me see if I can make my ideas clear.  The *tone* of the original piece
<br>
in this thread was grossly partisan.  As others pointed out, the first part
<br>
of it was waaay over the top in ascribing problems with the economy to
<br>
George Bush.  Yesterday morning I heard an interview with an economist on
<br>
fairly left-leaning NPR (can't recall his name) in which the economist
<br>
pointed out that the over-all performance of the economy was a much larger
<br>
factor in the current recession and projected federal government budget
<br>
deficits than the Bush tax cut.  The recession was well under way when Bush
<br>
was elected and had so much more to do with the bursting of the dot-com
<br>
bubble than Bush fiscal policies that the kind of rhetoric in the original
<br>
piece was just silly.  The problem is that to those for whom a Republican
<br>
administration isn't automatically offensive, such silly rhetoric is
<br>
offensive and sets off partisan alarm bells.
<br>
<p>The parts of the original piece about foreign policy are, as I said
<br>
yesterday, simply rehashing something that has been deeply problematic here.
<br>
To extreme partisans on both sides, it doesn't seem possible that a
<br>
reasonable person of good will could disagree.  Thus U.S. military action in
<br>
the Middle East gets called &quot;Nazi&quot; by one poster and  people on the extreme
<br>
of the other side consider opponents of military action Chamberlain-esque
<br>
pollyannas.  As I wrote last night, I honestly don't think it's possible to
<br>
have any kind of meaningful dialogue between the extremes on these issues.
<br>
(As an indication of where meaningful dialogue *is* possible, I give as an
<br>
example a group of my close personal friends who maintain a mailing list.
<br>
The list includes newspaper publishers, academics, state officials and many
<br>
lawyers.  I've known most of the people on that list for over 30 years, and
<br>
most of them are members of the Democratic party -- some very active in
<br>
politics.  We've discussed U.S. foreign policy without interruption for most
<br>
of those 30 years, the last two years no exception.  There's been
<br>
disagreement, but no lack of civility.  Interestingly, the majority of the
<br>
left-leaning Democrats on that list wholeheartedly supported -- and continue
<br>
to support -- U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, but opposed action in Iraq.
<br>
What I've never seen on that list of extremely well-informed people are
<br>
accusations of &quot;Nazism&quot; against the Bush administration, despite some pretty
<br>
powerful unhappiness about the 2000 election.)  The bottom line is that I
<br>
thought the original post was so extremely partisan that it *began* the
<br>
discussion in a way that discouraged civility.
<br>
<p>I responded to your posts about the Patriot Act for three reasons.  First,
<br>
it happens to concern a subject about which I have some professional
<br>
expertise, so I'm genuinely curious how it is that my perceptions are so
<br>
different from yours.  To restate, I see the day-to-day workings of the U.S.
<br>
justice system all the time, and I don't see signs of a significant erosion
<br>
of civil liberties.  (To give one example, I'm working on a case now that
<br>
federal prosecutors have an interest in and that is &quot;high profile,&quot;
<br>
generating a lot of pressure on prosecutors to *get results*.  I don't see
<br>
prosecutorial misconduct or infringement of civil liberties, despite the
<br>
fact that the U.S. Attorney's office wants convictions *very* badly.)
<br>
Second, I specifically suspect that much of the &quot;attitude&quot; to the Patriot
<br>
Act derives from the draft of the terrible so-called &quot;Patriot II&quot;
<br>
legislation.  If I thought there was a chance that that legislation would
<br>
pass, I would be upset, but I don't.  As I said in my reply to Barbara
<br>
Lamar, I think the justice system in the U.S. is just beginning the
<br>
deliberate process of reacting to the first Patriot Act, and I expect some
<br>
significant limits to be placed on that legislation.  Finally, I also
<br>
suspect that much of the negative reaction to post-911 legal matters derives
<br>
from a failure to distinguish between the civil rights of citizens versus
<br>
those of non-citizens.  In responding to your post, I was trying to
<br>
determine to what extent opponents of the law were arguing that the full
<br>
Bill of Rights should be applied to non-citizens, a novel legal theory and
<br>
one I'd be interested in seeing arguments for, if they exist.
