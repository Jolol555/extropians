<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I was under the impression that you were
<br>
an Australian citizen.  Is that correct?  If so, what direct influence,
<br>
exactly, do you have over the justice system in the US?  Additionally,
<br>
seeing as Australia contributed troops to the Iraqi Liberation military
<br>
venture, and you are (maybe) an Australian citizen, wouldn't it be
<br>
reasonable to argue that you had much more of a direct influence over
<br>
your countries involvement in the ousting of a murderous tyrant than you
<br>
do over an entirely different countries incarceration policies?  
<br>
<p>In fact, by your own ethical criteria, does that not mean that you are
<br>
required to focus your efforts on the things you have influence over,
<br>
that being events in your country or events your country is specifically
<br>
involved in, such as invading other countries?  Or is it just that you
<br>
readily abandon your ethical foundations at any chance to publicize
<br>
anything negative about the US?  
<br>
<p>Note:  Ignore all of this is you are indeed an American citizen.
