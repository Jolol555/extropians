On Mon Aug 04, 2003 07:11 pm Lee Corbin demanded:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, what is it about this aspect of evolutionary theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (that evolution tautologically causes the predominance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who reproduce most) that is so hard for many to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internalize? As you and I keep saying, it only takes one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, I think I can have a go at this one.
<br>
Basically, your tautological thesis is simply not true.
<br>
i.e. it is not what happens in the world as we know it.
<br>
<p>First, a primer on the two population types:-
<br>
<p>There are two basic strategies for populations, r-Strategists and
<br>
K-Strategists.
<br>
<p>r-strategists
<br>
<p>The r-strategists approach to continued survival is through rapid
<br>
reproduction, i.e., a high value of r. In fact, if we consider an
<br>
organism a pest, it is probably an r-strategist.
<br>
<p>In general r-strategists share a number of features:
<br>
<p>1. They are usually found in disturbed and/or transitory habitats.
<br>
2. They have short life spans. The house mouse, with a maximum life span
<br>
of 3 years, is an r-strategist.
<br>
3. They begin breeding early in life.
<br>
4. They usually have short generation times; that is, they have short
<br>
gestation periods and are soon ready to produce another crop of young.
<br>
The housefly can produce 7 generations each year (each of about 120 young).
<br>
5. They produce large numbers of offspring. The American oyster,
<br>
releasing a million eggs in one season, is an r-strategist. Most of its
<br>
offspring will die, but the sheer size of its output increases the
<br>
likelihood that some offspring will disperse to new habitats.
<br>
6. They take little care of their offspring, and infant mortality is
<br>
huge. Although humans are not r-strategists, the higher reproductive
<br>
rate in countries like India may well be a response to the higher rates
<br>
of infant mortality.
<br>
7. They have efficient means of dispersal to new habitats.
<br>
<p>For r-strategists, alleles that enhance any of the traits listed above
<br>
will be favored by natural selection.
<br>
<p><p><p>K-strategists
<br>
<p>When a habitat becomes filled with a diverse collection of creatures
<br>
competing with one another for the necessities of life, the advantage
<br>
shifts to K-strategists. K-strategists have stable populations that are
<br>
close to K (the maximum population an environment can support). There is
<br>
nothing to be gained from a high r. The species will benefit most by a
<br>
close adaptation to the conditions of its environment.
<br>
Typically, K-strategists share these qualities:
<br>
<p>1. They are usually found in stable habitats. Most of the species in a
<br>
mature forest will be K-strategists.
<br>
2. They have long life spans. The elephant and the tortoise are
<br>
K-strategists.
<br>
3. They begin breeding later in life.
<br>
4. They usually have long generation times. It takes 9 months to produce
<br>
a human baby.
<br>
5. Most produce small numbers of offspring. Birds are K-strategists,
<br>
most species producing fewer than a dozen young each year.
<br>
6. They take good care of their young. Infant mortality tends to be low.
<br>
7. K-strategists typically have evolved in such a way that they become
<br>
increasingly efficient at exploiting an ever-narrower slice of their
<br>
environment. Thus it is not surprising that many endangered species are
<br>
K-strategists.
<br>
<p>For K-strategists, alleles that enhance their ability to exploit the
<br>
resources of their habitat; that is, to increase the carrying capacity,
<br>
K, of their environment, will be favored by natural selection.
<br>
<p><p><p>Right, read all that?  Pay attention at the back!
<br>
<p><p>It seems probable to me that an advanced civilization will be a
<br>
K-strategy, monoculture population with no need or desire for rapid
<br>
reproduction. (They may send out probes for curiosity's sake, but no
<br>
expansion).
<br>
<p>However, Lee may well claim that all bets are off and an advanced
<br>
civilization can have whatever reproduction rate that Lee likes. What
<br>
Lee wants is an r-strategy reproduction rate linked to an advanced
<br>
K-strategy civilization. Very unlikely, in my opinion.
<br>
<p>So, here is a more general discussion on why K-strategy advanced
<br>
civilizations will not do rapid expansion.
<br>
<p>If everything was perfect for a population and all the individuals in
<br>
the population survived and reproduced at the maximum rate, that growth
<br>
rate is called the biotic potential. For example, when fish are
<br>
introduced into a lake where there is plenty of food and space and there
<br>
are no predators, the fish can reproduce at their biotic potential, but
<br>
not for a long time. This is exponential growth, until a limit is
<br>
reached. This is the perfect growth case that Lee believes will apply to
<br>
at least one advanced civilization which will take over the universe and
<br>
seed it with millions of Lee impressionists.
<br>
(I'm the real Lee! - No, I am .....  No, It's me really ........:)
<br>
<p>The possible limiting factors to population growth are many and
<br>
exponential growth must successfully defeat every one of them.
<br>
Note 1:  Perfect reproduction assumes perfection all the way down.
<br>
<p><p>Here are some of the possible limiting factors to population growth:
<br>
(Not all of which will necessarily apply to a post-singularity civilization)
<br>
<p><p>Birth Rate. Assuming advanced civilizations have complete control of
<br>
reproduction, then choice is the limiting factor here.
<br>
How many factories do we want to build, churning out mini-Lees?
<br>
Why would I allow him to do this, when mini-Bills are obviously much to
<br>
be preferred? ;)
<br>
You must also assume that mini-Lees are instantly self-supporting or
<br>
your time and resources will be spent supporting them (and limiting your
<br>
reproduction to what you can support).
<br>
Why reproduce if the existing population is not dying?
<br>
How will it benefit the existing population? (rather than being a drain
<br>
on resources).
<br>
Spreading the population around as security against disasters could be
<br>
thought of as a benefit. But an immortal civilization with total control
<br>
of the environment probably deals with any problems as a triviality.
<br>
Try to think of reasons that might appeal to a very advanced immortal
<br>
civilization (rather than just procreating to spread my genes around).
<br>
<p>Unlimited resources or life energy. A given supply of food and water
<br>
might be enough for a small population density. However, that same
<br>
supply might not be enough for a high-density population, and
<br>
competition among the individuals of the population would develop.
<br>
Competition is a force for evolution to occur. An advanced civilization
<br>
will only evolve by choice.
<br>
Note 2:   Unlimited resources means no competition, no competition means
<br>
no natural evolution.
<br>
Note 3:   Unlimited reproduction will eat the universe.
<br>
<p>Stress.  Many species need lots of territory to breed, like the mountain
<br>
lion. If there is no room, an organism can become stressed and have
<br>
lower birth rates.
<br>
Note 4:   Unlimited reproduction means unlimited expansion and physical
<br>
movement between stars.
<br>
<p>Pollution. Population affects the environment. So you have to devote
<br>
time and energy to cleaning up the mess.
<br>
“Population growth is the primary source of environmental damage.”–
<br>
Jacques Cousteau.
<br>
<p>Space. This is an obvious limiting factor, especially if you think of
<br>
fish in a lake. If you assume the universe is unlimited, then you can
<br>
keep on expanding, eating as you go. Although as the universe seems to
<br>
be expanding faster and faster, there may be a limit to what you can reach.
<br>
<p>Predators. Higher densities of a prey population attract more predators
<br>
and as the number of prey increases, so does the number of predators. On
<br>
the other hand, if the number of prey decreases, so does the number of
<br>
predators. Unlimited growth assumes that you won't meet any predators.
<br>
Are the Blue Meanies waiting to pounce?
<br>
<p>Other exponential growth populations. You might meet aliens coming the
<br>
other way as you expand. If you meet yourself, then you've proved that
<br>
it is a closed universe. ;)
<br>
<p>Diseases. Diseases can certainly have an impact on birth rate and thus
<br>
affect growth rate. Since many diseases are contagious, they are
<br>
therefore dependent on density. This could include mental infections
<br>
which could cause population restrictions.
<br>
<p>Parasitism. Parasitism is a relationship where one organism (the
<br>
parasite) feeds on the tissues or body fluids of another organism (the
<br>
host). In this type of relationship the parasite benefits and the host
<br>
is harmed, sometimes to the point of killing the host. Like diseases,
<br>
since parasites spread easier in a high-density host, their impact
<br>
depends on the density.
<br>
<p>The Universe. Natural disasters, meteor strikes, novae, black holes -
<br>
It's dangerous out there!
<br>
<p><p>Ooooh! To frightening for me. I'm going back to my rocking chair now :)
