Would you say this issue sums up to whether there is DIRECT INTERFACE WITH
<br>
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM or not? If so, that creates a special kind of cyborg, a
<br>
&quot;neurobot&quot; if you will. Anybody with a heart implant is a cyborg, but
<br>
Warwick may have been the first neurobot.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In my mind Warwick's claim to be the first cyborg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is unjustified. He has done little more than implant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a small transmitter tracking device that has no real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interface with or use to the body. The device would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have given exactly the same results if it were in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pocket, rather than under his skin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That said, I could be forced to agree that he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably the first human cyborg for being a cyborg's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sake. I believe his next step will be to implant direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neural connections and a transmitter. This is a far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater step towards Cyborgism and should yield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some interesting data. Direct interfacing is the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alex, Warwick did a simpler experiment in 1998 where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all he did do was implant a small transmitter in his arm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (without connecting it any way to the median nerve) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walk about with it, activating appliances in a computerised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; house, almost, as you aptly put it, as though it was in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pocket. Yet, in this book written in August 2002, he does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually get an electrode array surgically implanted into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the medial nerve of his left wrist for three months. I wonder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it is possible that you have heard of the earlier work and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are mixing it up with the later 2002 experiment? Certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Warwick is claiming he achieved direct interfacing (albeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a limited way) with this set of 2002 experiments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;A micro electrode array consisting of 100 individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrodes (only 20 of which were active due to manu-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facturer delivery time constraints) was implanted in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; median nerve (lower left arm above the wrist). The radius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of each electrode tip was 1-3 mm, the active region being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50-80mm long.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The technique (provided) selective recording and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimulation of sensory and/or motor neurons within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nerve fascicles.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The main difference between the 1998 implant and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new experiment was the connection that would be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the nervous system, ... using the Utah array. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main body of  the implant (was) a radio transmitter/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receiver (used) to send signals from (his) nervous system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by radio to the computer and to receive signals sent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again by radio, from the computer and play them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (his) nervous system via the median nerve in his arm.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amongst the achievements that Warwick would claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the 2002 experiments would be the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a first set of experiments in April 2002 Warwick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showed how signals from his brain could be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control robots, operate in a limited way an articulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robotic hand, and to manipulate the local environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the network in the cybernetics building).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a second set of experiments Warwick controlled the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robot hand via moving his fingers and sending a neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal to a computer then across the Atlantic, via the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet. He verified that he could receive a signal back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to his nervous system (a small shock to his median nerve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closing his left index finger) over the internet and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated a sort of bat like extra sense. To do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he wore an ultrasonic hat with sender and receiver
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antenna both wired from a wearable hat into his median
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nerve via the array such that he could judge the proximity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of approaching or retreating objects with his eyes closed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Warwick argues these are true cyborg powers because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensing over the internet and having a sonar sense like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a crude form of bat sonar is above and beyond the senses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of normal humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Warwick also managed to drive a wheelchair using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals sent from his median nerve when he opened and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closed his hand and managed to set up a crude sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Morse code whereby he and his partner (that had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single electrode implanted) could send each other simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; messages (essentially something or nothing - so a kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Morse code).  This for Warwick was *the* very big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal as he saw it as the first direct nervous system to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous system communication. Albeit in a simple form.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Mez writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Warwick was certainly not the first human to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; electrodes inserted into his body.  Back in 97, years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before Warwick had an electrode stuck in his arm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Phil Kennedy was inserting electrodes into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brains of patients with ALS and giving them the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ability to move cursors on computer screens by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought.  More than 20 years ago, Dobelle implanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his first patient with a cortical visual prosthesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; producing useful vision.  There are more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 80,000 people with cochlear implants now -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  electrodes stimulating their auditory nerve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All good points and Warwick would agree with these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Mez continues:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Warwick's experiments, by contrast, are rather tame.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here I think I must disagree. Whilst Warwicks successes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are mainly proof in principle they do imo achieve successes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *as* proofs in principle. That Warwick was able to get his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental protocols through ethics committees and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his finding on the record should make it substantially easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for others to do follow up research.  Warwicks research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows that given a sufficiently detailed understanding of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous system (which we are seriously lacking because its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so hard to get permission to do the experiments) it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to give amputees &quot;bridges&quot; over damaged nerves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to get direct nervous system control over wheelchairs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. He also puts on the record that the brain can quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopt and accommodate new sensory input without any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent side effects over a three month period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By doing what he did scientifically, in the way he did it, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a self promoting publicity machine Warwick pushed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peanut forward substantially in my view. He deliberately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courted the media and managed to make his relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with them a symbiotic one. In this I think his story, like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story of Michael West in Merchant's of Immortality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a story worth aspiring extropic entrepreneurs taking on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; board.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Natasha picks up Alex Blainey's point:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; IMO even people with artificial limbs or joints rank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; higher on the cyborg scale than Warwick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree in total.  You make an important point.  The art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of machine/human interface is being performed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most apt people around - those who need to upgrade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to live or function, rather than fancy footwork and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superficial accessorization at this point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To Warwicks credit he does not minimise the seriousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of artificial limbs, cochlea implants etc or the utility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wearables. All these things are seen as good. He is however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in improving the functionality and range of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial limbs and he is not averse, indeed he savours the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of not just replacing what is lost of normal human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function but positively adding too human capabilities as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter of choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Charles Hixson raises the point of what is a cyborg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and cybernetics:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps &quot;cyborgness&quot; should be considered a graduated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; phenomenon rather than a flip-flop.  This would put the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; first people to wear furs to stay warm at the most primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level of cyborg.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; OTOH, a person with a pace-maker is definitely more of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a cyborg than a guy with an implanted tracker.  (Cyborg:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cybernetic Organism. Cybernetic from the Greek steersman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  ref.: Norbert Weiner.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From a number of standpoints the precise definition of cyborg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be arbitrary. Warwick sees some merit in preserving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term not for wearables (though he doesn't diminish their importance)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but for &quot;something that is part-animal, part-machine and whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities are extended *beyond* normal limits. This is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more general than other definitions and includes creatures other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than humans. It allows for mental upgrades as well as physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upgrades and allows the extension to go beyond the normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits of either the animal or the machine.&quot; Warwick distinguishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wearables as part of a &quot;cybernetic system&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Samantha writes:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, Steve Mann of continuous wearable computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fame, is much more advanced as a practical cyborg imho
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than anyone with medical prothesis of any kind currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steve Mann certainly gets a favourable plug in the book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My interest Samantha was to try and find out what sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products and what the state of the art (or near state of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; art) in cyborg or cyborg-like technologies was. On the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the book gives a pretty good summary in retrospect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that from a practical point of view, at least in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short term there is a lot to be said for being able to put on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and take off  clothing having the sort of extra capabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one might have as a cyborg. However what intrigued me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the book was the argument that eventually the forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpersonal communication people use with each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will come to seem hopelessly inadequate in comparison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the sort of tech enable telepathy that may become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available. I was also on the lookout for work that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicate to me how much is actually able to be done in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of cutting into the bodies of volunteers who want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to experiment in an informed way with memory enhancements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and uploads in the future. What struck me was that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually know so little not just about the brain but about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nervous system generally, and that this is a logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence of our aversion to do research on living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans (including volunteers and ourselves).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [ Samantha again:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Manfred Clynes described the need for humans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artificially enhance biological functions in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; survive in the hostile environment of Space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This theme of the need to become cyborgs, to join
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the machines or be displaced by them is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying one throughout the book. Warwick like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moravec sees humans qua humans eventually becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a subspecies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the thoughts folks. In hindsight I reckon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book is a reasonably good read but as I said originally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is like looking over the shoulder of a researcher and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I imagine a ghost writer or several editors had to do a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of work to turn Warwicks notes into a readable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not very indexed book.
