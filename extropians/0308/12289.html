<p><em>&gt;Well, yes, but what *is* it that you are organizing/running/creating? e.g.

<p><em>&gt;Ah, I was referring to the text list (under construction by Dan
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fabulich) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definitive, identifiable, transhumanist-relevant larger projects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that people
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Thanks for the pointer to Dan's list, I'll look into that. I have to say
<br>
it's become increasingly clear that nobody has informed you that the only
<br>
reason I was invited to this elegant affair is because I saved Rose.
