<p>&nbsp;From Tetlock, P.E. (1999). Coping with trade-offs: Psychological 
<br>
constraints and political implications. In S. Lupia, M. McCubbins, &amp; S. 
<br>
Popkin (eds.), Political reasoning and choice. Berkeley: University of 
<br>
California Press:
<br>
<p>&quot;The value pluralism model also warns us not to assume that explicit 
<br>
trade-off reasoning is always cognitively or morally superior to 
<br>
categorical rejection of trade-offs.  It is not difficult to identify 
<br>
historical contexts within which contemporary sympathies overwhelmingly 
<br>
favor those factions that engaged in vociferous trade-off denial: 
<br>
Churchillian opponents of British appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 
<br>
1930's who denounced Chamberlain’s effort to strike a subtle balance 
<br>
between deterrence and reassurance (Tetlock &amp; Tyler, 1996) and 
<br>
abolitionists in the slavery debates of antebellum America who denounced 
<br>
moderates who sought integratively complex compromises that would pressure 
<br>
the Union, avert war and indefinitely preserve slavery in certain states 
<br>
(Tetlock, Armor, &amp;  Peterson, 1994).  It is also not difficult to identify 
<br>
historical contexts within which contemporary observers deplore one or 
<br>
both of the values that complex trade-off reasoners attempted to balance 
<br>
against each other.  Pragmatic Nazis were quick to recognize a gruesome 
<br>
trade-off between their goals of mobilizing military resources to win the 
<br>
war and devoting resources to the extermination of Jews.  There is nothing 
<br>
intrinsically meritorious about trade-off reasoning.&quot;
<br>
<p>My argument was not that Robert was posing a taboo tradeoff, but that he 
<br>
was posing a false tradeoff - genocide would have no beneficial 
<br>
consequences, despite the attempt to frame it as a taboo tradeoff which 
<br>
rationalism requires considering.
<br>
<p>I don't think outrage should always be impermissible.  I think outrage can 
<br>
always be questioned.  Sometimes outrage survives questioning and the 
<br>
proposal of random acts of genocide is one of those cases.  I acknowledge 
<br>
that I could be wrong in the outrage or even the judgment of 
<br>
undesirability, but the judgment of undesirability and the associated 
<br>
outrage represent my best guesses.  What I object to is not that Robert 
<br>
analyzed the issue, but that he got the analysis wildly wrong.  It is mere 
<br>
rationalism to assume that any issue worth analyzing, or any issue that 
<br>
provokes deep emotional reactions, must have a complex, weighty, 
<br>
counterintuitive answer with many pros and cons where the conclusion 
<br>
ultimately negates all the emotional reactions involved.  Sometimes 
<br>
rationalists arrive at complex taboo-violating analyses of what seem like 
<br>
simple issues, but it is a profound error to generalize and start thinking 
<br>
that whoever offers the most complex analysis and violates the most 
<br>
taboos, sounds the most rational.
<br>
<p>The undesirability of genocide is a very complex issue in terms of ethics 
<br>
under uncertainty and the evolutionary psychology of opposing tribes, but 
<br>
what the analysis ends up saying only affirms the verdict of history and, 
<br>
yes, the 21st-century taboo: the power of genocide to improve the human 
<br>
condition is far less than what is frequently imagined.  Robert's proposal 
<br>
is not a taboo tradeoff, it is a false tradeoff.
<br>
<p>I believe that a hospital should not spend a million dollars to save the 
<br>
life of a five-year-old child, because if you take a million dollars away 
<br>
from a hospital, people are going to die.  I would applaud the moral 
<br>
courage of a hospital administrator who made that decision, and the 
<br>
willingness to confront taboo tradeoffs and risk community outrage to make 
<br>
the right choice.  It doesn't mean that I'll be any less outraged if you 
<br>
propose killing a five-year-old child to save a dollar, and this is 
<br>
roughly what I think Robert did.
