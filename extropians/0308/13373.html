Hmm, is it just my swedishness, or are the tone of these letters a bit
<br>
aggressive? Also, pointing out that cryonicists are technologically
<br>
sophisticated and using the Galileo card sounds downright cultish.
<br>
Especially in the US I have the distinct feeling that suggesting that
<br>
religion is a superstition is not on average going to predispose people
<br>
kindly. Could it be that we are reacting a bit too reflexively?
<br>
<p>Maybe the core issue should be stated more calmly: yes, this is a 
<br>
practice some people see as pseudoscience or yukky, but almost any 
<br>
practice, be it cremation, the use of antibiotics for appendicitis or 
<br>
acupuncture is viewed as pseudoscience or yukky by *someone* (or even 
<br>
most people). That still does not mean it should be hindered unless it 
<br>
actually hurts somebody. A society which cannot tolerate diversity and 
<br>
unusual ideas is going to end up impoverished and intolerant.
<br>
<p>I wonder if one could get some of Richard Florida's ideas about how the
<br>
creative class moves in here. Essentially, if a place like Michigan
<br>
shows that it does not tolerate the unusual (by banning cryonics and
<br>
tounge splitting) it sends a signal to many of the cultural creatives
<br>
that increasingly form the core of economic growth that this is not the
<br>
place to be. It does not matter that most never would even consider
<br>
getting a suspension or split tounge, they know that their own
<br>
particular interests or views might be circumscribed and that the area
<br>
is less likely to attract other interesting people - so they go
<br>
elsewhere. Is that a desired signal? 
<br>
