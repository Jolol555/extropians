<p>Water hyacinths also double their weight in an incredibly short time
<br>
(they're considered a horrible nuisance when they get loose in a lake,
<br>
because they quickly cover the whole surface). I totally agree that
<br>
hydroponics is more efficient than soil in many cases, and hydroponic
<br>
gardens can be as beautiful as soil based gardens (the visual aesthetics are
<br>
almost as important to me as the efficiency; I find that generally the two
<br>
are positively correlated). I believe even fruit trees are being grown
<br>
hydroponically these days.
<br>
<p>My experience has been that while a pond or tank is extremely valuable and
<br>
more effficient at producing calories per cubic foot than soil, it's more
<br>
expensive to grow food such as squash, tomatoes, and broccoli hydroponically
<br>
than on soil (and I'm not even sure you can grow root crops such as potatoes
<br>
and sweet potatoes hydroponically), and that it takes less space to deal
<br>
with human waste using thermophilic composting (to quantify it -- for one
<br>
adult and one teenager, the space required for the compost pile was four
<br>
feet cubed -- this handled not only our bodily wastes but also kitchen
<br>
waste, waste paper, etc.), and that water purification is not as good at
<br>
getting rid of pathogens as thermophilic composting; but it's likely that
<br>
the techniques I've used for water-based purification are not the most
<br>
efficient, and you've inspired me to do further research and
<br>
experimentation.
