I just did a free rendering into somewhat idiomatic English of the great
<br>
philosopher Kant's key essay (for a German newspaper) on the topic of the
<br>
Enlightenment. Of course, where I speak of representatives and elected
<br>
heads of state he was speaking of Frederick the all powerful ruler; he
<br>
meant Prussia where we tend to read the USA. His tone is somewhat
<br>
chillingly patronizing to most of his fellow citizens, but that isn't alien
<br>
to many posts on this list. What is disturbing is how little the rhetoric
<br>
and argument has changed in nearly a quarter of a millennium. 
<br>
<p>The most hilarious line comes toward the end, where Kant mentions that at
<br>
least these pesky thought controllers don't try to interfere with our
<br>
choices in science and the arts. Maybe this was bleak irony, but I suspect
<br>
it was just that few people had access to either, and that the sciences had
<br>
not yet revealed their power.
<br>
<p>When I say `idiomatic' I'm speaking loosely; the tone that comes through
<br>
still has a musty 1930s flavor. You can compare a more literal
<br>
interpretation at

<p>=======================
<br>
<p>IMMANUEL KANT
<br>
An Answer to the Question: &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot; 
<br>
Konigsberg in Prussia, 30th September, 1784.
<br>
<p>Enlightenment is our emergence from self-imposed intellectual submission.
<br>
By submission I mean the refusal to trust your own grasp of reality, bowing
<br>
to the dictates of authority. What's lacking in the submissive isn't any
<br>
raw capacity for understanding, but the resolution and courage to use it
<br>
without kowtowing to imposed direction. So the motto of enlightenment is:
<br>
Have the guts to use your own intelligence, to follow your own reasoning!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do so many people happily submit their whole lives long to authority?
<br>
Laziness and cowardice! This allows a few among us, all too easily, to set
<br>
themselves up as guardians over the rest. It's so convenient to drift
<br>
along! If I can depend on a manual of instructions, a spiritual adviser to
<br>
serve as my conscience, a doctor to choose my prescriptions, all the rest
<br>
of it, I needn't make any effort. Don't think, just pay up and toe the
<br>
line; let others take over the tedious job of thinking for me. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those do-gooders who generously accepted the task of running our lives
<br>
quickly made sure that the majority think any step in the direction of
<br>
self-command must be extremely dangerous and difficult. First they dumb us
<br>
down, then they lead us by the nose. In reality, the danger isn't so very
<br>
great. Despite a few early topples, everyone eventually learns to walk. But
<br>
falling on your face intellectually is intimidating, and usually frightens
<br>
us off from further attempts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such self-imposed submission becomes almost second nature, so for an
<br>
isolated individual it's hard to work your way free. You grow fond of being
<br>
told what to do and think-it's nice to have someone else do the work for
<br>
you! When you've never been allowed to make the attempt, you lose the
<br>
capacity to exercise your own understanding. Dogmas and formulas come to
<br>
seem the automatic and rational default. In fact, they're a brake. Yet if
<br>
you wiggle free of those rules you find you're paralyzed, since you're
<br>
unaccustomed to moving by yourself. To date, only a few individuals have
<br>
cultivated their own minds sufficiently to free themselves from management
<br>
by others. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, an entire community stands a better chance of enlightening
<br>
itself. In fact, if people are left free to work things out for themselves
<br>
in a spirit of solidarity, enlightenment is almost inevitable. Here's how
<br>
it works: even among the elite, there'll always be those few who do think
<br>
for themselves. Once they make the breakthrough to enlightenment, they can
<br>
start to spread the spirit of rational respect for personal value, for the
<br>
duty we all have to think for ourselves. Strangely, though, a public that's
<br>
been under the thumb of self-appointed guardians is likely to insist on
<br>
retaining the status quo. Numbing routines of thought finally avenge
<br>
themselves on the very people who first established the rules (or whose
<br>
predecessors did so). A community can only achieve enlightenment slowly,
<br>
working against this inertia. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bloody revolution may well succeed in putting an end to autocratic
<br>
despotism, to rapacious or power-seeking oppression-but it can never
<br>
produce a true reform in ways of thinking. Instead, new knee-jerk habits,
<br>
no better than the ones they replaced, will emerge to control the
<br>
thoughtless majority.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For enlightenment, all that's needed is freedom of public speech, the most
<br>
innocuous form of all: freedom to make public use of your reason, whatever
<br>
the issue. Yet around the world we hear: Don't argue! The military roar:
<br>
Don't argue, get in line! The tax-official: Don't argue, pay up! The
<br>
clergyman, the rabbi, the mullah: Don't argue, trust in God! By contrast,
<br>
our own enlightenment culture says: Argue as much as you like and about
<br>
whatever you like, with one proviso: At the end of the arguments, obey the
<br>
law! 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are restrictions on freedom everywhere. Yet while some
<br>
restrictions prevent enlightenment, others actually promote it. Here's the
<br>
paradox: the public use of reason must always be free, and by itself it can
<br>
bring about enlightenment. But private reasoning may quite often be very
<br>
narrowly restricted, without unduly hindering the progress of
<br>
enlightenment. The public use of your own reason is what we might call the
<br>
work of the public intellectual, addressing the community in informed
<br>
debate. What I've termed the private use of reason is the mental activity
<br>
required when you accept a task with which you're entrusted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it would be damaging if a military officer on duty quibbled
<br>
openly about the appropriateness or usefulness of an order. He must simply
<br>
obey his superior. But he can't reasonably be stopped from commenting on
<br>
any errors in the military service, even putting these criticisms forward
<br>
publicly for judgement. A citizen can't refuse to pay taxes levied on him,
<br>
but he doesn't contravene his civil obligations by publicly voicing
<br>
objections to the impropriety or even injustice of such taxes. A clergyman
<br>
is employed by a church on condition that he will instruct pupils and
<br>
congregation in accordance with its doctrines. But as a scholar, he is not
<br>
only completely free but also obliged to covey to the community his
<br>
carefully considered, well-intentioned thoughts on any mistaken aspects of
<br>
those doctrines, and to offer suggestions for a better arrangement of
<br>
religious and ecclesiastical affairs. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is nothing in this division of rights and responsibilities to
<br>
trouble the conscience. He'll say: Our church teaches the following
<br>
doctrine, using the following arguments. He then extracts as much practical
<br>
value as possible for his congregation even from precepts he harbors some
<br>
doubts about, but which he can nevertheless undertake to expound, since it
<br>
is not in fact wholly impossible that they may contain truth. Of course if
<br>
the clergyman found anything opposed to the essence of religion in them,
<br>
he'd have to resign his post rather than teach against his conscience.
<br>
Conversely, as a scholar addressing the world at large through his
<br>
writings, the clergyman making public use of his reason enjoys unlimited
<br>
freedom to use his own reason and to speak in his own person. Otherwise
<br>
there is no means to break free of error, an absurdity which amounts to
<br>
making absurdities permanent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A social contract intended to prevent all further enlightenment of
<br>
humankind forever is absolutely null and void, however solemnly ratified.
<br>
One age cannot enter into an alliance on oath to put the next age in a
<br>
position where it would be impossible for it to extend and correct its
<br>
knowledge, particularly on such important matters, or to make any progress
<br>
whatsoever in enlightenment. This would be a crime against human nature,
<br>
whose original destiny lies precisely in such progress. Later generations
<br>
are thus perfectly entitled to dismiss these agreements as unauthorized and
<br>
criminal. To test whether any particular measure can be agreed upon as a
<br>
law for a people, we need only ask whether a people could justifiably
<br>
impose such a law upon itself. This might well be possible for a specified
<br>
short period as a means of introducing a certain order, pending, as it
<br>
were, a better solution. This would also mean that each citizen,
<br>
particularly the ethicist, would be given a free hand as a scholar to
<br>
comment publicly, that is, in writings, on the inadequacies of current
<br>
institutions. Meanwhile, the newly established order would continue to
<br>
exist, until public insight into the nature of such matters had progressed
<br>
and proved itself to the point where, by general (if not unanimous) consent
<br>
a proposal could be submitted to the lawmakers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is absolutely impermissible to agree, even for a single lifetime,
<br>
to a permanent ethical constitution which no-one might publicly question.
<br>
For this would virtually nullify a phase in humanity's upward progress,
<br>
thus making it fruitless and even detrimental to subsequent generations.
<br>
For a limited period, you may ethically postpone enlightening yourself in
<br>
matters you ought to know about. But to renounce such enlightenment
<br>
completely, whether for yourself or even more so for later generations,
<br>
means violating and trampling underfoot the sacred rights of humankind. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if people may not even impose such a restriction upon itself, still
<br>
less can it legitimately be imposed upon it by their leaders. Their
<br>
legislative authority depends precisely upon their role in uniting the
<br>
collective will of the people. So long as they see to it that all proposed
<br>
improvements are compatible with civil order, leaders can otherwise leave
<br>
the citizenry to do whatever we find necessary for our betterment, which is
<br>
our own business. The role of law-makers and enforcers is to stop anyone
<br>
forcibly hindering others from working as best they can to define and
<br>
promote their well-being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we yet live in an enlightened age? No, but we do live in an age of
<br>
enlightenment. As things stand at present, we still have a long way to go
<br>
before people generally are in a position (or can ever be put into a
<br>
position) of using their own understanding confidently and well in ethical
<br>
matters, without outside guidance. But there are distinct indications that
<br>
the way is now being cleared for the populace to work freely in this
<br>
direction, and that the obstacles to universal enlightenment, to our
<br>
emergence from his self-imposed submission, are gradually becoming fewer.
<br>
In this respect our age is the age of enlightenment, the century of access
<br>
to knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spirit of freedom is also spreading globally, even where it has to
<br>
struggle with outward obstacles imposed by governments which misunderstand
<br>
their own function. For such governments now witness examples of how
<br>
freedom may exist without in the least jeopardizing public concord and the
<br>
unity of the commonwealth. Citizens will of their own accord gradually work
<br>
their way out of barbarism so long as artificial measures are not
<br>
deliberately adopted to keep them in it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have portrayed religious and ethical deliberation as the focal point of
<br>
enlightenment. Our political leaders have no interest in assuming the role
<br>
of guardians over their citizens in regard to the arts and sciences. But
<br>
the attitude of heads of state who favor freedom in the arts and sciences
<br>
extends even further, for they realize that there's no danger even to law
<br>
and order if the rest of us are permitted to make public use of our own
<br>
reason, even if this entails forthright criticism of current legislation. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It boils down to this, then: Argue as much as you like on any topic, but
<br>
obey the law! Considered in the widest sense, in human affairs nearly
<br>
everything is paradoxical. A high degree of civil freedom seems
<br>
advantageous to a people's intellectual freedom, yet it also sets up
<br>
insuperable barriers to it. Conversely, a lesser degree of civil freedom
<br>
gives intellectual freedom enough room to expand to its fullest extent.
<br>
What is special and singular in human nature, our inclination and vocation
<br>
to think freely, can develop inside these socially stabilizing constraints,
<br>
and gradually changes the way we view the world and our capacity to act in
<br>
it. Bit by bit, we become increasingly able to act freely. Eventually, even
<br>
governments learn that they can profit by treating men and women-who are
<br>
more than simple machines-in a manner appropriate to our dignity.
