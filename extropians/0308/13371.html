<em>&gt; &lt;&lt; 100 years ago we did not have the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in many parts of the country.   Battery technology is an important aspect
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Light weight materials are also a plus.   It is hardly a worthwhile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument among extropians to put down something just because it hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already been done!  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not share your boundless optimism (which is an Extropian trait)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerning the development of robust alternate technology. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think it was &quot;boundless enthusiasm&quot; and I wasn't really speaking 
<br>
generally about development of robust alternate technolgy in this case.  I 
<br>
was speaking about what makes electric cars more possible today.    This is a 
<br>
much more delimited subject.  
<br>
<p>To get general for a minute though, OF COURSE we can develop robust alternate 
<br>
technology in many different areas of our current infrastructure as better 
<br>
computation and materials, particularly toward the nanotech scale along with 
<br>
better techniques become available.  This is a no-brainer.  What is more 
<br>
questionable is only which technology areas are going to be subject to a fair 
<br>
amount of change how quickly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;After seeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what little has progressed since the 1st oil shock of 1973, I am very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cynical. The reason is that I have no patience anymore with technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams that never seem to come true. There are always people (sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself) who predict great technical advances, but these developments never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it to either the marketplace, or even as a demonstration project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (technically doable but still too expensive).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  You didn't sleep through the computer/information revolution did you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, I am basically saying I am tired of being deceived. People have waited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a long time for these technologies to mature to the marketplace, and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ain't. By the way, I hope You are right and these cars, generators, solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells, and reactors jump on the scene, in defiance of my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pessimism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sooner or later some of them  obviously will come on the scene as real 
<br>
alternatives unless we so severely screw up as to scrap technological advance 
<br>
or do ourselves in.   
<br>
<p>I am curious what benefit you believe this particular pessimism holds for you.
