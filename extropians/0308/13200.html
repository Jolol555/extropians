<p>
Another factor worth taking into account is that a lot gets done despite
<br>
people being lazy, stupid and misguided. It is easy to fall into the
<br>
trap of assuming that everybody ought to be as smart and reasonable as
<br>
oneself. But it is also easy to think that everybody is an idiot - it is
<br>
mostly a matter of current mood and personality. In reality there is an
<br>
even mix of people, and no futuristic project based on assuming that
<br>
people are homogeneous has any real chance of working. 
<br>
<p>Transhumanist discussion often assumes that transhumanists have a key 
<br>
position - as an avant garde leading the revolution, as the architects 
<br>
designing the posthuman future. But even if that vision were to be true 
<br>
it would have to rely on the masses. And in reality most of the changes 
<br>
in technology, economy and ways of living come from below rather  than 
<br>
from top-down leadership. Figuring out how to actually build affordable 
<br>
matter compilers, use neurointerfaces and live with life extension is 
<br>
something that will be done in a distributed manner. And it cannot 
<br>
really be planned, it has to happen. The best we can do is to show the 
<br>
way, make people interested, help to make it politically possible and 
<br>
acceptable and formulate overarching visions that hopefully provide a 
<br>
framework on which to build. But we should not be surprised or dismayed 
<br>
that people build what *they* want, not what *we* want.
