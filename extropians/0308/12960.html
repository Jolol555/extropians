<p>I strongly second this, though I know how you feel, I read, save
<br>
or mentally note far more of the tech posts than I comment on. Also
<br>
because I don't read via the Javien BBS, my browsings don't show
<br>
up on the counter, so if your tempted like me to take that as some
<br>
gauge of interest, be aware that it is not picking up all browsings.
<br>
<p>BTW: I posted an article on Stem Cell recently, that imo (and I do
<br>
feel pretty well placed to comment on the political  aspects in this
<br>
field) is something of a real political or social watershed. But the
<br>
breakthrough is not in the science per se, its in the acceleration
<br>
past the bottleneck that had formed in stem cell science politics
<br>
and social policy. My point is that sometimes the topics are of
<br>
such that the significance is not always obvious even to generally
<br>
bright folk.
<br>
<p>In my case I also tend to post the occasionally rough and sloppy
<br>
post just to keep in contact, I'm not always on my best behaviour,
<br>
and that probably influences my credibility for other busy folks
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
