<p>Whew! Treading on dangerous ground, Spike, asking people to make jokes
<br>
about libertarianism. Especially on this list. ;)
<br>
<p>Dave Barry IS a libertarian - see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/dave-barry.html">http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/dave-barry.html</a>
<br>
so he may be a bit reluctant to send them up.
<br>
<p>Or, at least, he used to be a Libertarian. I found one comment on the
<br>
web &quot;I think Dave Barry used to be a Libertarian, but since they have
<br>
become the Blue-Skinned Alien Abductee Party I haven't heard much praise
<br>
of those loons from him.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>His humor is very much against big government.
<br>
But if he was to have a go at libertarianism he might say:
<br>
<p>A libertarian would stop beside the man with the flat tire but only to
<br>
explain that emotionally he would really, really like to help him, but
<br>
it would go against his rational libertarian beliefs. He would explain
<br>
that it is for the man's own good to learn that occurrences like this
<br>
should be dealt with by self-reliance and advance planning via insurance
<br>
policies and contracts rather than ask for adhoc assistance as and when
<br>
required.
<br>
<p>As he waves cheerily and drives off. a wasp flies in the window and
<br>
stings his ear. In shock, he waves frantically at the wasp, his SUV
<br>
veers off the road and rolls over, throwing him out. The man sits up,
<br>
just in time to see his SUV bouncing down the ravine to finally explode
<br>
in a ball of flame. He pauses, thoughtful for a moment, then looks 
<br>
round at the man with the flat tire and says 
<br>
&quot;I think I can help you change the tyre now.&quot;  :)
