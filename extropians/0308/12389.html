Hello Sébastien,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I used the word &quot;extropians&quot; in a serious discussion recently and once again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was reminded that extropians sound like goofy cultists.
</em><br>
<p>Are SETI enthusiasts (i.e. the people who dedicate their spare
<br>
computing time to SETI@HOME -- *not* people who believe in UFOs)
<br>
&quot;cultists&quot;?  [One could ask the question about many other distributed
<br>
computing projects with the possible exception of GIMPS -- we all
<br>
*know* Spike is a cultist... :-?]
<br>
<p>I think one of the key questions to pose is &quot;Does this have a reasonable
<br>
chance of working?&quot;.  Followed by &quot;Yes, I *know* it has never been done
<br>
before -- but look at the history of development of literally *everything*
<br>
difficult -- the automobile, the airplane, the VCR, the heart transplant,
<br>
the defeat of communism -- *all* of them have *never* been done before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not being able to find out why they were thinking that,
</em><br>
<p>Because a &quot;reasonable&quot; reaction to something &quot;never done before&quot; is
<br>
to believe that it cannot be done.  One has to make a reasonable case
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or have them forward me a link where one serious extropian sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like they say,
</em><br>
<p>I try to &quot;sound like I say&quot; (though a few familiar with my comments
<br>
over the last 5 years might object to several cases).
<br>
<p>It is *very* simple for me.  &quot;More information is better than less
<br>
information&quot; -- or perhaps &quot;Complexity is good&quot; (though this gets
<br>
a bit more problematic if short term complexity reduces long term
<br>
complexity).
<br>
<p>I believe one can derive most extropian principles (and perhaps a
<br>
complete moral philosophy of extropianism and transhumanism from
<br>
such a starting point).
<br>
<p>[I disagree slightly with Natasha with regard to the specific
<br>
differences between extropianism, transhumanism and posthumanism
<br>
[&quot;the 3&quot;] as I believe some fairly reasonable differences were outlined
<br>
recently at the World Transhumanis Association conference, esp.
<br>
during its introduction seminar.  But these differences tend
<br>
to be *very* minor compared with the gap between &quot;the 3&quot; and most
<br>
other religions, philosophies, political or moral systems, etc.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would be the best answer to someone who would say that the primo body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mind uploading are allegoric figures that transhumanists and extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are offering that permits to fantasm a body removed from it's attaches with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the present, the here and now, impossible bodies,
</em><br>
<p>If I understand this statement correctly, esp. &quot;allegoric&quot; and &quot;fantasm&quot;,
<br>
the answer for me is that we are *not* proposing allegorical or fantasy
<br>
bodies.  We *REALLY* intend to do it (or we think humanity will do it).
<br>
Although a &quot;primo body&quot; or a disembodied upload state are &quot;impossible&quot;
<br>
now -- that is no proof that they are forever impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; wich makes them promoter of an ascetic ideal, who hates the body and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the flesh (and are possibly even worse than christians at it,
</em><br>
<p>In some sense, at least for extropianism, there is the promotion of
<br>
an &quot;ascetic ideal&quot; (e.g. more information is better than less information).
<br>
It is not that one &quot;hates&quot; the body, it is just that one can recognize
<br>
there are potentially improvements (from bodies to other forms)
<br>
that can contain more information (or may allow a more creative
<br>
exploration of the &quot;form&quot; space).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (alienation is to be understood here as &quot;being estranged to oneself&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>One does not have to be in any way &quot;estranged&quot;.  We could not be here
<br>
without having gone through the entire journey that evolution previously
<br>
laid down for us.  It is simple to respect and value that.  But that
<br>
does not prevent us from believing there may be better ways (as in
<br>
improved bodies, cyborgs, uploads, etc) with which the future may be
<br>
explored and complexity increased to a greater extent than current
<br>
bodies allow.
<br>
<p>(at least those are my opinions -- I cannot speak for other extropians)
<br>
Robert
