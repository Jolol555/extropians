<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Psychology of the Unthinkable: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Taboo Trade-Offs, Forbidden Base Rates, and Heretical Counterfactuals
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip E. Tetlock, Orie V. Kristel, S. Beth Elson, Melanie C. Green, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennifer Lerner.  The Ohio State University and Carnegie Mellon University
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research on social cognition ultimately rests on functionalist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assumptions about what people are trying to accomplish when they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge events or make choices. The most influential of these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assumptions have been the intuitive scientist and the intuitive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economist. The former tradition depicts people whose central
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objective is to understand underlying patterns of causality, thereby
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conferring some advantage in anticipating life-enhancing or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threatening events (cf. Kelley, 1967). The latter tradition depicts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people as decision-makers whose overriding goal is to select
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;utility-maximizing options from available choice sets (Becker, 1981;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979). Although theorists often disagree sharply
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over how well people live up to the high professional ideals of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science or economics (Mellers, Schwartz, &amp; Cooke, 1998), theorists
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agree in placing a normative premium on intellectual flexibility and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agility. Good intuitive scientists and economists look for the most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;useful cues in the environment for generating accurate predictions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and making satisfying decisions and quickly abandon hypotheses that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not &quot;pan out.&quot;  Rigidity is maladaptive within both frameworks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article explores the empirical implications of an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under-explored starting point for inquiry: the notion that, in many
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contexts, people are striving to achieve neither epistemic nor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;utilitarian goals,  but rather--as prominent historical sociologists
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have argued (Bell, 1974)--are struggling to protect sacred values
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from secular encroachments by increasingly powerful societal trends
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward market capitalism (and the attendant pressure to render
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything fungible) and scientific naturalism (and the attendant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressure to pursue inquiry wherever it logically leads).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sacred value can be defined as any value that a moral community
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implicitly or explicitly treats as possessing infinite or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transcendental significance that precludes comparisons, trade-offs,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or indeed any other mingling with bounded or secular values.   When
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacred values are under assault, the apposite functionalist metaphor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quickly becomes the intuitive moralist/theologian.  Sacred values
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are often ultimately religious in character but they need not have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divine sanction (hence our hybrid designation of the functionalist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metaphor as moralist/theologian).  Sacred values can range from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamentalists' faith in God to the liberal/social democratic dogma
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of racial equality to the radical libertarian commitment to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autonomy of the individual.  Although the theoretical framework
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed here does not differentiate sacred values with or without
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divine mandate, many writers -- from Samuel Johnson to Fyodor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dostoyevsky to T.S. Eliot -- have drawn sharp distinctions here, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have even suggested that only sacred values anchored in faith in God
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can sustain genuine moral outrage and cleansing. To paraphrase
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dostoyevsky, if there were no God, no act -- not even cannibalism --
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be forbidden. which depicts people engaged in a continual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struggle to protect their private selves and public identities from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moral contamination by impure thoughts and deeds (Belk et al.,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1989).  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most emphatic ways to distance oneself from normative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgressions are by:  (1) expressing moral outrage---a composite
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;psychological state that subsumes cognitive reactions (harsh
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character attributions to those who endorse the proscribed thoughts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and even to those who do not endorse, but do tolerate, this way of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thinking in others), affective reactions (anger and contempt for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who endorse the proscribed thoughts), and behavioral reactions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(support for ostracizing and punishing deviant thinkers); (2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;engaging in moral cleansing that reaffirms core values and loyalties
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by acting in ways that shore up those aspects of the moral order
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that have been undercut by the transgression.  Within this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;framework, rigidity, accompanied by righteous indignation and by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blanket refusal even to contemplate certain thoughts, can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commendable  -- indeed, it is essential for resolutely reasserting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the identification of self with the collective moral order (cf.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Durkheim, 1925/1976).  What looks irrationally obdurate within the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intuitive-scientist and economist research programs can often be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plausibly construed as the principled defense of sacred values
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within the moralist/theologian research program (Tetlock, 1999).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article identifies three types of normative proscriptions--
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taboo trade-offs, forbidden base rates, and heretical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counterfactuals--that people consciously or unconsciously impose on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cognitive processes that are fundamental to rationality in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intuitive scientist and economist traditions. Here we consider each
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proscription in turn.
