Alex Bokov:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Mike is right about a bunch of things, but all too many of them are noisy,
<br>
contentious 20th century brick-and-mortar issues that really are less
<br>
important to the fate of humanity than what's on-topic for this list. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Since I joined this list a few years ago, its generally been a lot of 
<br>
rambling threads, no harm in that. The brick and mortor issues that you mentioned, 
<br>
haven't left us at all. While strides have been made in nanotech, for example; 
<br>
it surely hasn't exploded on the scene the way K. Eric Drexler suggested back 
<br>
in the mid 1980's. My point is that the world is, what the world is, whether we 
<br>
like it or not. Because it will someday be the year 2020, does not mean that 
<br>
everything will have advanced technologically to match our dearest visions. Is 
<br>
the need for conformity, a need to avoid painful realities? That, I can 
<br>
relate. But please say so, as part of policy, make nothing vague, make everything 
<br>
emphatic. I like Orions Arm too! But don't expect to live in such a cosmos.
<br>
<p>Alex Bokov:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Diversity of opinion is important. So, let's start a
<br>
Paleo-Libertarian/Conservative Extropian list and outsource all debate
<br>
regarding non science/technology/memetics topics to there. If there is 
<br>
demand,
<br>
lets also start a corresponding Liberal/Socialist Extropian list. And leave
<br>
this list to people who put the word Extropian first and the modifiers second
<br>
(or absent).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That seems a good suggestion, however, when, in month's past I have posted 
<br>
articles about technical progress, or quotes from great minds, etc; it goes over 
<br>
like a lead balloon! I believe Dr. Graps, and Dr. Serafino have experienced 
<br>
that same result, though they should speak for themselves, and not me.
<br>
<p>Bickering is very, very, human; but it doesn't seem to be transhuman, and 
<br>
that is what draws the mosts posts/reactions.
