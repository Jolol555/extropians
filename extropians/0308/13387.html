Damien B. asks about a comment in

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        ...this object in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        the middle casts a shadow, it absorbs all the light incident on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        it and it also bends light from behind it away from our line of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        sight, so light that would normally reach our eye from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        gas behind it gets deflected...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But hang on... yeah, it bends light behind it *away* from us, but equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it should bend some of the light coming at it sideways *toward* us, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more or less exactly compensating for what we'd see were it not there?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this happens, but not enough to compensate.  There are a couple of
<br>
ways to explain it.  The more literal one is that the compensatory light
<br>
rays are emitted at a narrower range of angles than the ones shifted away,
<br>
hence there is less light.
<br>
<p>Another way to see what is happening is illustrated for example at
<br>
<a href="http://www.astronomynotes.com/relativity/s4.htm">http://www.astronomynotes.com/relativity/s4.htm</a>, which shows how a
<br>
gravitational field can deflect light coming from being it.  The net
<br>
effect is a spatial distortion where objects move outward from their
<br>
actual position, and are seen as farther from the center of the nearby
<br>
object than they are.
<br>
<p>Now imagine this happening to a uniform grid behind the gravitating
<br>
object.  The dots near the object will be displaced outward; those far
<br>
from the object won't be affected; and in between there will therefore
<br>
be a ring with a higher density of dots.  If we think of the dots as
<br>
uniform light emission, we see a darker area near the gravitating object
<br>
and a brighter ring surrounding it.
<br>
<p>If you imagine this happening to a uniform light behind the nearby object
<br>
(like the BH accretion disk, which is uniform in one dimension, anyway),
<br>
the effect is the same, that the image is distorted and shifted outward.
<br>
This means that more light comes from a ring around the BH and less from
<br>
the immediate apparent vicinity.  I think this is what they mean by its
<br>
&quot;shadow&quot;.
