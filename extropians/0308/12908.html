<em>&gt; How about if you and I and several other business partners develop a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the product to a competitor. You make out big time and I lose out big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. Oh wait, I forgot-- because the competitor did not have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend the money and time to develop the product (just the money he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave you), he can sell the product more cheaply than our company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have.  Less development expenses, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And now, you say, in reply, I (and the other partners) can buy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product more cheaply than before. If I can make enough at Walmart to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy the product, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gee, business partner, please don't do me any more &quot;favors.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, not to put too fine a point (guess I do have to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that...), as an analogy, we Americans and our ancestors built this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country into a place with tremendous competitive advantages: we as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voters control and have exclusive labor market access to the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumer market ever.  That means that we can charge far more when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell our labor here in the USA to labor buyers who want to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products to this enormous consumer market.  Compare to third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlders, for example.
</em><br>
<p>### So where is the analogy? You are one of the Founders? You built this
<br>
country? You hammered the nails in the Transcontinental Railway?
<br>
<p>Nah, the analogy goes like this - you are a junior partner, who wants to
<br>
take over the firm built by generations, stop hiring workers who are cheaper
<br>
and maybe better than him, and wants to get paid by seniority instead of
<br>
real work.
