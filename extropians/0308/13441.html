<p>How many people is it okay to kill for no apparent reason?

<p>&quot;We don't do body counts,&quot; - Gen. Tommy Franks.
<br>
<p>The latest number from: <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/">http://www.iraqbodycount.net/</a> is Min 6118, max 
<br>
7836 CIVILIANS.  Granted, that's not 6 million Jews.  What I'm 
<br>
objecting to is the &quot;RA RA - yippee, death from above!&quot; routine.
<br>
<p>&quot;Precision Bombing&quot; is a funny group of words when put next to &quot;Shock 
<br>
and Awe&quot; - did we just go over there and do a nice fireworks show for 
<br>
people?  google: &quot;Mother of all bombs&quot;.  We couldn't use nukes, 
<br>
obviously, so instead we come up with THIS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I fear we will see a

<p>You think that the US occupation of Iraq and support for Israel's 
<br>
occupation of the West Bank has nothing to do with this?  That somehow 
<br>
it's THEIR FAULT?  That's called blaming the victim.
<br>
<p>If you look at the material underpinnings, you would see the necessity 
<br>
of the war and of the backlash.  We need their oil (for now), if it 
<br>
becomes expensive, we take it because it's better for the 
<br>
military-industrial complex in the long run to have wars and take oil 
<br>
rather than pay for it.  With oil reserves running visibly low (most 
<br>
aggressive estimate I've heard is 17 years of oil left), it's no 
<br>
surprise that we're very very interested in the large oil producers 
<br>
right now.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
