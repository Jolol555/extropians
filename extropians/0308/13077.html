<p>I'm on an American Bar Association moderated list where the discussion
<br>
topics range far and wide, but there are strict rules about politeness and
<br>
topics that are not welcome -- for example, controversial political topics.
<br>
There are sublists of the main list, and the rules allow members to
<br>
introduce, say, a political topic for the purpose of letting other list
<br>
members know that the topic is up for discussion on the sublist. But if
<br>
someone responds to the initial post on the main list, that person is gently
<br>
reminded to take it to the sublist. If the person persists in ignoring the
<br>
list rules, that person loses his or her posting privileges (interestingly,
<br>
I've never seen a female lose her posting privileges; it's always males who
<br>
can't seem to back down).
<br>
<p>Mike was incredibly rude to Natasha, and I thought she responded politely
<br>
and diplomatically on the list. I'm not sure what I would have done in her
<br>
place, I know I would have been very upset if someone had talked to me the
<br>
way Mike talked to her. But I don't think he would have been asked to leave
<br>
if it had been only a personal matter. As Greg pointed out, if one doesn't
<br>
have fairly high standards, the quality of a list suffers, and the quality
<br>
of the list reflects on ExI itself.
<br>
<p>It's a pity that Lee and others have chosen to leave rather than approach
<br>
the situation as an opportunity to make the list, and the organization,
<br>
better.
