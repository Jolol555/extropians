<p><p>Lower Import Prices Haven't Lifted Living Standards After All
<br>
Alan Tonelson
<br>
Tuesday, August 26, 2003
<br>
<p>&nbsp;With even normally free-trading Republican Congressmen up in arms
<br>
about globalization-related job loss, America's globalization-happy
<br>
economic establishment is preparing its counter-attack. Among the
<br>
trade-extremist bromides we're likely to hear most often is that
<br>
today's monumental import levels are blessings for all Americans
<br>
because they reduce consumer goods prices and thus raise real incomes.
<br>
<p>America's working families, we're told, benefit most because, as U.S.
<br>
Trade Representative Robert Zoellick argues, &quot;When trade is
<br>
restricted, hard-working fathers and mothers pay the biggest portions
<br>
of their paychecks for the higher costs food, clothing, and appliances
<br>
imposed through taxes on trade.&quot;
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, there's no serious evidence to support these claims. In
<br>
fact, when you look at the effects of trade not only on consumer
<br>
prices but on wages and employment levels, it's clear that current
<br>
trade policies and their impact have been undermining American living
<br>
standards for decades.
<br>
<p>Take the biggest picture macroeconomic data. American economic history
<br>
has long been a story of strongly rising real wages – that is, wages
<br>
adjusted for the effects of inflation. These wages – the best measure
<br>
of an American worker's value in the global labor market – were
<br>
critical engines of an equally strong rise in American living
<br>
standards. But during the 1970s, these engines stalled out.
<br>
<p>Real wages for all private sector workers peaked in 1973 at $9.08 per
<br>
hour. Today, they've fallen to $8.33 per hour – more than 8 percent
<br>
lower. Two points stand out from this development. First, as Zoellick
<br>
has noted in speeches, this thirty-year period witnessed a more than
<br>
doubling of trade volumes and returns on international investment as a
<br>
share of the U.S. economy. Second, inflation-adjusted wages by
<br>
definition take into account the widely documented and dramatic fall
<br>
in the prices of most imported goods during this period.
<br>
<p>The only reasonable conclusion possible: Even though trade has helped
<br>
bring lower consumer prices (along with more efficient production
<br>
methods and a continuing fall in the prices of most raw materials,
<br>
whether domestic or imported), wages have fallen even faster for the
<br>
typical American. And the onset of wage stagnation coincides almost
<br>
perfectly with the onset of the American economy's dramatic
<br>
internationalization.
