<p>Hmmmm. So you are saying that you believe something will happen that has
<br>
never happened before in the history of the universe? (Because there is 
<br>
no sign of them out there).  And all the other times that the opposite 
<br>
happened in the past in our history, don't matter?
<br>
<p>Any civilization is a product of its past history. An immortal
<br>
Z-strategy post-singularity civilization will be master of its local
<br>
environment and using intelligence beyond our understanding to
<br>
control its own evolution.  As a Z-strategy civilization it will
<br>
have a long history of seeking very low reproductive rates before it
<br>
gained access to very large (possibly unlimited) resources.
<br>
<p>The r-strategy populations that maximise reproduction in our world are
<br>
all natural evolution cases where suddenly an abundance of food becomes
<br>
available. The post-singularity civilization is consciously controlling
<br>
its own evolution. Big difference!

<p>This statement is incorrect. The fact that a few populations move from
<br>
one strategy to the other is well-known and much studied. Several
<br>
species have been studied which go through repeated and regular
<br>
population 'Boom and Bust' cycles. They start off as r-strategists and
<br>
breed furiously. Next phase, they hit one of the limits, move to being
<br>
K-strategists and the population collapses. Then the cycle starts over
<br>
again. Any of the standard limiting factors can be the cause of the
<br>
'Bust' phase, food, space, predators, parasites, etc. But this
<br>
interesting phenomenon is driven by Nature 'red in tooth and claw' and
<br>
is totally irrelevant to a post-singularity civilization which is
<br>
intelligently controlling its own evolution.
<br>
<p>As a rule, populations DO NOT change from r-strategy to K-strategy. Once 
<br>
a Z-strategy elephant - always a Z-strategy elephant.
<br>
Similarly, once an r-strategy rat - always an r-strategy rat. Rat high
<br>
reproductive volume continues even in lean times. That's why an
<br>
r-strategy species has a high reproductive rate - they know many
<br>
children will die. That is their survival tactic.
<br>
<p>It is most unlikely (I believe impossible) that a K-strategy
<br>
post-singularity civilization will suddenly decide that a better
<br>
survival strategy is to breed like rats and swamp the universe.
<br>
<p>I suppose it is theoretically possible that they might suddenly decide
<br>
&quot;Hey look, we can afford it now. See at all that food out there. Let's
<br>
go eat the universe!&quot;. Remember they have recently gained unlimited
<br>
resources so they can afford the unlimited expansion.
<br>
But if they already have unlimited resources, why would they want more?
<br>
<p>Infinity is so restricting, don't you think? ;)
<br>
<p>This expansion throughout the universe has not happened so far and it
<br>
seems to me to be unlikely to the point of impossibility that a
<br>
z-strategy civilization would do something so against the very nature of
<br>
their civilization. As they have unlimited resources already, they don't 
<br>
need safety in numbers. Let's hear your reasoning if you wish them to 
<br>
behave otherwise!
<br>
<p>My description provides a reasoned explanation of why the universe is
<br>
not full of either a single (the first!) species, or full of warring
<br>
civilizations all trying to swamp the universe with their own species.
<br>
i.e. The Great Silence is because that's the way advanced civilizations
<br>
want it.
<br>
<p>The other alternative, of course, is as Lee originally suggested, that
<br>
we are actually the first intelligent species in our light cone.
