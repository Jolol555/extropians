</em><br>
<p>So according to you it's acceptable to be brave ONLY when fulfilling 
<br>
contracts.
<br>
<p>Will it be your (15th century) opinion that citizens have a contract 
<br>
with each other implicit in their organization as a country by virtue 
<br>
of their birth?  Dusting off the REALLY old books, huh?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Only the honorable, genuinely brave people provide a reasonable

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Only the calm, smart, relentlessly rational, long-term thinkers

</em><br>
<p>Apparently not.  Don't watch the news much, do you?
<br>
<p>In any case, I'm not advocating stupidity, but bravery.  Bravery and 
<br>
cunning are both virtues of a warrior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Such people
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; design societies and themselves by recourse to game theory, ruthlessly
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Right, they'd be brave.  Not only would the face death if needed, but 
<br>
they would kill if needed.  We agree, you just don't like to call a 
<br>
spade a spade - These &quot;calm, smart, relentlessly rational, long-term 
<br>
thinkers&quot; who are willing to &quot;face death if needed&quot; are just brave.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The brave will run headlong into battle as soon as some manipulative
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear of the unknown.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe it's a language thing.  You seem to be thinking of the word 
<br>
&quot;Foolhardy&quot; not &quot;Brave&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Death to the brave!
</em><br>
<p>That's awfully hotheaded of you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you'd like a world in which people come together to jointly improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their world, promote bravery and goodness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### No, I run scared of bravery and goodness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whenever you project the outcome of &quot;goodness&quot; far enough into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it becomes either identical with self-interest (however defined), or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descends into incoherence.
</em><br>
<p>Will you be giving a formal proof of this or do you have it on God's 
<br>
authority?  Well, you did leave &quot;self-interest&quot; open to be defined any 
<br>
way you want so your statement here could be equivalent with &quot;Whenever 
<br>
you project the outcome of goodness it becomes identical with goodness&quot; 
<br>
which is clearly so, but not apparently what you're claiming.  To give 
<br>
this any sense at all you're going to have to define self-interest.  
<br>
It's doubtful that you could do this without reference to goodness.  
<br>
cf. Principia Ethica.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Calm rationality, and a long-term outlook are all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we need to make the best world there can be.
</em><br>
<p>Doubtful.  Calm rationality and long-term outlook has made this world 
<br>
the way it is NOW.  Is this the best world there can be? (in something 
<br>
more than a tautological sense.)
