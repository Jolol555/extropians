Lee:
<br>
&lt;&lt;C'mon, if you think that any CEOs are going to the cellar
<br>
to be shot, or marched up to guillotines, then you are
<br>
too far from reality.  Even if you are right about overpaid
<br>
top executives, then the worst that will happen is that
<br>
they'll be replaced by cheaper and more effective CEOs from
<br>
within the ranks, as the fad of outside celebrity wears off.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>No, I am sure that most of these selfish bastards will get off scott-free,  
<br>
no matter how crooked or coniving they have been, and how they, through their 
<br>
actions, have cheated the stockholders, and are drying up the middle class. My 
<br>
point is thats it is destructive to US survival.
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I urge everyone to carefully attend to Rafal's *economic* arguments.
<br>
So far in perusing this thread, he appears to be the only one up
<br>
on free-market economics, who understands thoroughly why protectionism
<br>
always hurts everyone in the long run.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Rafal seems devoted to the nth degree in favor of free market economics. 
<br>
Though, I wonder what Milton Freedman (sp?) looking at what is happening to 
<br>
Americans would concur with Rafal's zeal?
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Right here, even the US is not really hurt by sending jobs
<br>
oversees where they can be done more cheaply and efficiently
<br>
because the American consumer is then so much better off.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>There is an inevitable cause and effect here, and if not Newtonian, is mighty 
<br>
close. When goods and services by American companies, or foreign imports 
<br>
become depressed; because more and more Americans are out of work, this produces a 
<br>
deflationary economy, also known as a recession. 
<br>
<p>If capital goes overseas, during a recession, so that few jobs are produced, 
<br>
the economy stays moribund. This hurts even people overseas, as demand they 
<br>
are dependent on, becomes so much less. I may purchase a Korean auto because it 
<br>
is cheaper; but if I am broke and have to buy a used car, for example, I will 
<br>
buy a clunker junker of any kind, to look for work. Far less people benfit 
<br>
from my purchase.
<br>
<p><p><p>Lee:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Hey Mitch, they got caught, didn't they??  The American
<br>
economy---unlike European ones---is doing just fine.  Look
<br>
at the GNP and unemployment rate.  I think you and far too
<br>
many other people want the make-believe of the late nineties
<br>
back, where everybody was employed on projects that were
<br>
eventually canceled and everyone thought that they were 
<br>
getting rich in the markets.  Real life is not like that.
<br>
*This* is normal---and not so bad, so long as you are not
<br>
having to make difficult life decisions about what to do
<br>
next to help (i.e., you are unemployed yourself).&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>1) I disagree the American economy is doing just fine. If the unemployment 
<br>
rate drops significantly, W will have nothing to worry about. If it remains at 
<br>
this level, or even grows, prepare for a political explosion or implosion. 
<br>
Europe sucks because of its own reasons, which have more to do with their own 
<br>
hypocrises and inconsistancies, not America's.
<br>
<p>2) If the middle class shrinks our economy will resemble Argentina's which 
<br>
was going great-guns from the 19th century to the Great Depression, but 
<br>
disintegrated along with it's middle class. This is not an accurate model, but the 
<br>
de-stablization is. 
<br>
<p>Mitch
