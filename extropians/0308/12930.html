<p>
A reply to dissenters.  I didn't want this to turn into a rant, but if  
<br>
you want proof, you want proof...
<br>
<p>1)  <a href="mailto:Dehede011@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">Dehede011@aol.com</a>: I know that corporate consolidation of economic  
<br>
power is OLD NEWS.  I said so.  I just presented the evidence in case  
<br>
you weren't aware.  Sorry if it was too obvious, but you asked for  
<br>
proof.  Those are the facts underlying the policy.  If you're looking  
<br>
for &quot;policy proof&quot; that follows here:
<br>
<p>2)  As for whether I've &quot;proven&quot; anything I've claimed, my claim is the  
<br>
combination of the weak moral claim:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) You shouldn't buy products from people who are killing or enslaving  
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>To which I take it there is no dissent.
<br>
<p>(And the strong economic claim:)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)  Disclaiming of economic ties is bullshit - if you own a company  
<br>
who's doing dirty business, then YOU are doing dirty business.  Even if  
<br>
this support is &quot;leveraged and hedged&quot; against an index fund like the  
<br>
S&amp;P 500 - your minimal ownership is still benefiting from the  
<br>
oppression of others. Supporting companies that do dirty-business is  
<br>
just dirty-business - funding them is participating.
<br>
<p>Which is perhaps only slightly contentious - at least I haven't heard  
<br>
it denied.  I've heard the position defended (elsewhere) that the  
<br>
ability to corporately disclaim responsibility from investments is what  
<br>
led to the ascendency of the Western World.  On this point, it's not  
<br>
clear that this is a good thing AND it's not clear what would have  
<br>
happened had we insisted on personal responsibility from the outset.
<br>
<p>Don't like it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When he said, repent, I wonder what he meant&quot; - Leonard Cohen.
<br>
<p>(And the even stronger disenfranchisement claim:)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)  If there are no corporations NOT found in the nexus of  
<br>
killer-corporations (eg, companies owned by companies that profit from  
<br>
human slavery and killlings then our moral responsibilities (under (c)  
<br>
above) become somewhat abated and redirected under the general rule  
<br>
Ought Implies Can.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( (cf. Columbia Water/Bechtel/PepsiCo, etc....  
<br>
<a href="http://www.trilliuminvest.com/pages/news/">http://www.trilliuminvest.com/pages/news/</a> 
<br>
news_detail.asp?ArticleID=250&amp;status=CurrentIssue ) or Nike, etc.))
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)  Ought implies can.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which simply means that you can only be required to do a thing if you  
<br>
can actually do it.  I take it this is uncontentious as well.  Maybe a  
<br>
Kantian might deny it - perhaps you can be required to do things that  
<br>
are impossible for you.  I don't know how that can be defended  
<br>
COMPLETELY though.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)  Which leads to the more generalized moral requirement that we  
<br>
CHANGE the economic system that supports consolidation of power under  
<br>
wicked people or more stringently enforce laws that prevent the  
<br>
wickedness both here and abroad.  This because we Americans CAN (eg. we  
<br>
vote, we can speak freely, we can run for office, participate in the  
<br>
political process, etc.)  If we couldn't we would probably be in the  
<br>
position of pre-revolutionary France and our moral responsibility would  
<br>
be revolution.  But it's not, so no point in talking that way YET.
<br>
<p>(Here's where I get a little Libertarian on y'all:)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f)  But the enforcement of existing laws (and the improvement of them)  
<br>
tends simply to protect the economic power of the &quot;long money&quot;.
<br>
<p>The empirical proof of this is simply to point out that Barclays is  
<br>
still on top along with those banks that the Bank of England and  
<br>
Barclays saw fit to give hand-outs too in the 1800's.  If law  
<br>
enforcement and government could solve this problem, THEY WOULD HAVE.   
<br>
If anyone wants to have a drawn-out discussion about how  
<br>
early-investment tends to play out in the medium-run (eg. 200-500  
<br>
years), we can do that.
<br>
<p>The a priori proof would be that the &quot;long-money&quot; is able to manipulate  
<br>
short-term goals of individuals to it's best interests by simple  
<br>
behavioristic motivation - carrot, stick, fear, greed,  
<br>
enforcement-&gt;behavior.
<br>
<p>(And the nasty conclusion:)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g)  We must change the economic system that supports consolidation of  
<br>
power under wicked people.  This is our first civic responsibility (as  
<br>
opposed say to the moral responsibilities we have to our families).
<br>
<p>While we might take &quot;mini-steps&quot; to only buy gas from minor companies,  
<br>
not to drive to work, to live like neo-Primitivists, this will only  
<br>
tend to increase the power of the &quot;long-money&quot; in the long run unless  
<br>
you can convert a significant (eg. more than a billion) number of  
<br>
people to this way of thinking.  (Perhaps this is what China OUGHT TO  
<br>
DO, but I don't know.)  BECAUSE technology will defeat primitivism,  
<br>
it's inevitable (witness who enslaved who from 1700-1800).
<br>
<p>Followed by the policy proposal:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h)  We need to enforce free-marketeer values FROM THE TOP DOWN and  
<br>
BOTTOM UP.
<br>
<p>(I know, sounds vague and slogan-y.  Here's the what I mean:)
<br>
<p>TOP DOWN - This means NOT starting free-marketing from the perspective  
<br>
of widgets and labor-hours and the companies that do that business, but  
<br>
from the point of view of Laws, Governments, Jurisdictions and  
<br>
Currencies.  Otherwise we end up with heavily protected &quot;castles&quot; of  
<br>
capital able to protect themselves by force and technology against an  
<br>
unwilling and rather upset mass of people.  (We'll assume that this is  
<br>
a BAD thing for the moment, pace the villianization of poverty by  
<br>
Rafal.  In any case, MOST people in that case would have a lower  
<br>
standard of living and would likely be upset enough to do something  
<br>
about it - &quot;Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.&quot;)
<br>
<p>BOTTOM UP - It also means not starting free-marketing from the  
<br>
perspective of Corporations, but rather from the point of view of  
<br>
Individuals.  Individuals are the primary bearers of rights (perhaps  
<br>
pace Extropian dogma, I don't know.  But I know it can be defended  
<br>
either positively or negatively, that is if rights are defined  
<br>
positively or negatively).  And their freedom of movement, association,  
<br>
speech, etc. are to be released PRIOR to any release of Corporate  
<br>
Restrictions.
<br>
<p>I believe the combination of these two &quot;rights-movements&quot; would  
<br>
significantly improve our chances for creating survivability as well as  
<br>
significantly put a stop to major human rights violations worldwide.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g)  This means starting competing government services - competing  
<br>
currencies, competing social services, etc.  This can be done in a  
<br>
variety of ways.   I would recommend starting with Health services and  
<br>
exchange services to enable exchange of resources for the immediate  
<br>
improvement of the longevity issue.  I understand Bill Gates has a good  
<br>
idea in putting his money into infant mortality.  Bully for him.
<br>
<p>(An aside - Bill Gates is a major blemish in the record for the  
<br>
Long-Money managers.  We can regard the Internet Boom as the deliberate  
<br>
effort on the part of the Long-Money to prevent the creation of further  
<br>
multi-billionaires.  I expect you all probably know  this, maybe I'm  
<br>
wrong?)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h) This also means changing the laws so that they don't vigorously  
<br>
defend the rights of corporations against individuals and competition.   
<br>
In particular, freedom of exchange AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS would be a  
<br>
good start - the elimination of the national banking system and those  
<br>
systems which are dependent upon it.  This would have to start with  
<br>
political action.  In this regard, the Libertarian party is the best  
<br>
current venue INASMUCH as it is not being co-opted by the likes of Karl  
<br>
Rove and Rafal.
<br>
<p>3)  Rafal's question is a valid one, &quot;Should he be prevented from  
<br>
making an arbitrary exchange with consenting persons?&quot;  The answer is  
<br>
yes - if you are exchanging human lives (perhaps any of the value which  
<br>
results from human lives), you should be prevented from making  
<br>
ARBITRARY exchanges of that kind.  You should be prevented by those  
<br>
morally responsible for that person's being - themselves, their friends  
<br>
and family, etc.  In any case, it should be the other way around - the  
<br>
political forces which exist to enable you to make such exchanges  
<br>
should be removed.  In today's world this means removing border and  
<br>
economic restrictions on individuals and political organizations FIRST  
<br>
while enforcing those rules on corporations.
<br>
<p>4)  Dialectical Ad Hominem for Rafal:  On Nike's slavery commitments,  
<br>
20 seconds on google will get you all the information you need.  You've  
<br>
been informed, the responsibility is now yours.  (first reference:  
<br>
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/cslnews/">http://www.geocities.com/cslnews/</a> ).  It did, after all, make it to the  
<br>
supreme court.  WHY do you think that major US corporations ship their  
<br>
labor oversees if not to take advantage of cheaper labor?  Do you think  
<br>
that labor doesn't become inhumanely cheap so as to be morally  
<br>
equivalent with slavery?  Really?  Do you think that Government  
<br>
Protectionism for &quot;long-money&quot; corporate wealth isn't at the root of  
<br>
this problem?   I'm just trying to determine if you simply don't KNOW  
<br>
that it's going on or if you are trying to redefine words so that it  
<br>
doesn't sound so bad.
<br>
<p>5)  A grammatical reply for Rafal:
<br>
<p>Slavery is  vague word like other words &quot;fraud&quot; or &quot;peace&quot; or &quot;bald&quot;,  
<br>
etc.  The point is simply to recognize the underlying phenomena to  
<br>
which it refers (people who work for less than $.01/day and can't go  
<br>
work someplace better or who are psychologically and/or politically  
<br>
dominated by their workplace so significantly that they can't leave.)   
<br>
You can call THAT phenomena BAD or GOOD, that is our choice.  You  
<br>
appear to be calling it GOOD.  I call it BAD.  As for word choice,  
<br>
&quot;Slavery&quot; is the closest single-word that I could think of that  
<br>
simultaneously described the situation (lack of financial freedom  
<br>
coupled with political/psychological domination transcending  
<br>
generations), if you have a better word, I'm happy to use YOUR WORD for  
<br>
THAT.
<br>
<p>BUT if you think that obfuscating this issue into an issue about the  
<br>
meaning of words is going to CONVINCE THIS AUDIENCE, I sincerely hope  
<br>
you're fooling yourself.
<br>
<p><p>6)  Bringing this back to Extropian(ism) - Extropians have a choice -  
<br>
Extropianism can be a form of elitism where the wealthy, powerful and  
<br>
extremely clever are brought into the new world of long-term-life OR it  
<br>
can be a form of liberation where the resources of all people can be  
<br>
used to benefit ALL people.  One might say that Pragmatism demands the  
<br>
former.  I say that Pragmatism demands the latter for two reasons, on  
<br>
policy and one pragmatic:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)  The goal of creating a mechanism capable of supporting Longevity  
<br>
(if not immortality) FOR ME or US requires both the technology and  
<br>
political climate to let it survive.  This means both gathering  
<br>
resources (an economic issue) and support (a political issue) for the  
<br>
effort LONG TERM.  Since concentration of power naturally leads to  
<br>
dissent, and dissent to war, a better tactic will be to create a stable  
<br>
political and economic environment in which everyone could (and would  
<br>
have a reasonable expectation TO) participate in extropianism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)  The world created in which only people who were able to utilize  
<br>
the resources of other people for their own advancement and their  
<br>
detriment would be a massively competitive world (much like our own) -  
<br>
with long-term high-tech competition comes extreme risk.  Risk is BAD  
<br>
if you're trying to build a long-term survival machine.  Increasing  
<br>
risk by fostering conflict is stupid.  Oppressing a group of people  
<br>
fosters conflict - even if they are the (seemingly) weak and poor.
<br>
<p>7)  Not that it's any of my business (being a newbie to the  
<br>
&quot;extropians&quot; list) but I will miss: <a href="mailto:Dehede011@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">Dehede011@aol.com</a> if he leaves  
<br>
because of someone else's leaving.
<br>
<p>Best Wishes,
<br>
<p>Robbie Lindauer
