<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>This is a *good* thing!
<br>
<p>STEM CELLS: Scientists Create Britain's First Stem Cell Line
<br>
<p>(link below)
<br>
<p>Reason. 1. The UK which (now) has the worlds most liberal
<br>
stem cells laws (excepting perhaps China and those that don't
<br>
really have laws) but was not as advanced as other places
<br>
(like the US and Australia) has now caught up (or imo) even
<br>
passed the high water mark set by these countries.
<br>
<p>Reason 2. The cell lines will be available to researchers
<br>
unencumbered. Think open source in terms of accelerating
<br>
rates of understanding. Think less toll gates on the product
<br>
development highway.
<br>
<p>Reason 3. Because embryos are allowed to be created to
<br>
around the 5 day stage from people known to have diseases
<br>
(such as Parkinson's) etc. The resulting stem cell lines (cells
<br>
taken from the Inner Cell Mass of the blastocyst (= 5 day
<br>
old embryo) can give vital clues into the how a genome with
<br>
Parkinson's develops. And thereby offers better (more
<br>
focussed, cheaper, quicker) drug discovery.
<br>
<p>As Robert Bradbury is wont to say on occasion. Today
<br>
is a good day to be an extropian :-)       - and a person.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett

STEM CELLS: Scientists Create Britain's First Stem Cell Line
<br>
<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20030813/sc_nm/health_brit">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20030813/sc_nm/health_brit</a>ff t<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists said on Wednesday
<br>
they had created Britain's first human embryonic stem
<br>
cell line, clearing the way for more research into
<br>
diseases including diabetes and Parkinson's.
<br>
<p>The team, at King's College London, said the new line
<br>
&nbsp;-- a string of many identical cells -- would be deposited
<br>
&nbsp;in the Medical Research Council's $4.2 million stem cell
<br>
bank, which was launched last year.
<br>
<p>Stem cells hold the promise of treating a range of medical
<br>
conditions but their use is controversial because although
<br>
they are found in adult tissue, the most flexible stem cells
<br>
come from early embryos.
<br>
<p>In this case, the researchers said they obtained three stem
<br>
cell lines from 58 embryos. Two cell lines perished but the
<br>
remaining one had now been growing for many months.
<br>
&quot;We are very excited about this development,&quot; said Dr
<br>
Stephen Minger, one of the leaders of the team whose
<br>
work was published in Reproductive BioMedicine Online.
<br>
&quot;Human embryonic stem cells are found in the earliest stages
<br>
of development and are capable of giving rise to all the
<br>
different types of cell in the body. This means their possible
<br>
therapeutic uses are almost endless.&quot;
<br>
<p>Minger told Reuters the researchers were particularly
<br>
interested in research aimed at generating new cells for
<br>
transplantation in diabetes and Parkinson's disease .. and
<br>
possibly also for patients with heart disorders.
<br>
<p>Traditionally, stem cell lines have been created with great
<br>
difficulty using cells from embryos surplus to IVF, which
<br>
are often of poor quality. But in this case, high-quality
<br>
embryos were donated by women undergoing pre-
<br>
implantation genetic diagnosis because they were known
<br>
to be at risk of passing on serious genetic disorders if they
<br>
had children.
<br>
<p>Only embryos unaffected by these disorders were replaced
<br>
into the women. Cells from the remaining embryos, which
<br>
were unsuitable for replacement and would normally have
<br>
perished, were used to generate the stem cell lines.
<br>
<p>The Kings College team was one of the first two laboratories
<br>
in Britain to be granted a license by the Human Fertilization
<br>
and Embryology Authority to generate human embryonic
<br>
stem cells.
