<p>Move to Austin!  It's not part of Texas :-)  Seriously though, let's not 
<br>
finger Texas.  When I lived in California, it was very inappropriate and 
<br>
often dangerous to make fun of Spirituality.  It all depends on what moral 
<br>
vehicle people are using, not the specific piece of earth.

</em><br>
<p>Sure:  Here are 2 of my favorite quotes I think about when people try to 
<br>
push their beliefs on me:
<br>
<p>“I like to do all the talking myself. It saves time, and prevents 
<br>
arguments.”   Oscar Wilde
<br>
<p>“. . . an equally great [talker] knows when to stop.”
<br>
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;From my book on a topic of how to deal with difficult people or those who 
<br>
simply shut down when you want to discuss living longer:
<br>
<p>The best way to understand the person who you are talking to is to take the 
<br>
time to listen to that  person. Who is the person I am talking to?  What 
<br>
are his or her needs, interests and concerns?  People will let you know, 
<br>
one way or another,  within a few minutes who they are.
<br>
<p>The next step is to do a little math on the cost to benefit.  Discern if 
<br>
the time and energy expended will be a productive and successful 
<br>
exchange.  (9 out of 10 it is.)  If the numbers line up and it looks like a 
<br>
profitable expenditure, choose a strategy of communication.
<br>
<p>Which strategy? Are you in this to win friends and influence, or rave about 
<br>
your own views while alienating the other person and ending up in a pissing 
<br>
match? This is where critical thinking comes in.
<br>
<p>Since the goal is to do the best job with the least amount of stress, 
<br>
you’ve probably chosen educate and are ready to employ the hardy 
<br>
handy-tools of monitoring information,  feedback, error correction, 
<br>
accurate replay, and collision avoidance. These tools are for preventative 
<br>
emotions and, if nothing else, will help to keep emotions calm.
<br>
<p>With the foundation established, the softer tools are employed, a common 
<br>
ground of interest.  People tend to be more receptive to new ideas if they 
<br>
know that we share something in common. At this point, the refining tools 
<br>
such as historical parallels give that extra quality of expertise. People 
<br>
seem to be more receptive to challenging ideas if given examples of 
<br>
historical events that relate to the discussion.
<br>
<p>Practicing patience is a tool that I keep protected in fine chamois.  No 
<br>
matter how successful a person is in one domain, he may lag behind in 
<br>
another.  People develop at different rates—an early-bird or eleventh-hour. 
<br>
People have different psychological barometers for accepting change and 
<br>
challenge. Sometimes we need to repeat ourselves over and over for the 
<br>
concept to set in.
<br>
<p>Ignite curiosity.  “Every question we answer leads on to another question. 
<br>
This has become the greatest survival trick of our species,” writes Desmond 
<br>
Morris.  “I think, at a child’s birth, if a mother could ... endow ... the 
<br>
most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity,” mused Eleanor Roosevelt.
<br>
<p>Just when I think my communications are flowing smoothly, I sometimes hit a 
<br>
snag.  I revert to humor because its the best way I know how to rescue the 
<br>
conversation and give it a little polish. .
