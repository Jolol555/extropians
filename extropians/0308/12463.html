<p><em>&gt; &gt; And just why aren't they using the energy available in our solar system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because we are here and they are more ethical than we seem to be.
</em><br>
<p>All of them.  Throughout our infinite universe.  How convenient
<br>
that they are so unworldly ethical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, perhaps there is some sort of instinct to &quot;breed abundantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolved. But why should that be inimical to our posthuman values?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because it is a silly program to extend indefinitely.
</em><br>
<p>And why?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; For one thing, is not appealing to bring life to the outer reaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the universe?  Why should matter not be rescued from its currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dead state almost everywhere?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you honestly believe that we are the only life, on this one itty-bitty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet, in all the universe?   
</em><br>
<p>Of course not!  Remember that the universe is infinite.  There are
<br>
even infinitely many worlds with me writing this to you.  (As Randall
<br>
has just pointed out, why do we need to repeat so much on this list?
<br>
Didn't you read the Tegmark threads at all?)
<br>
<p>The question is, what is the chance that there is any life within
<br>
a billion lightyears of here, given that we have seen no sign?
<br>
I say---exactly because we have seen no sign---that it is very
<br>
high (like .999).  What do you think the chance is---within 10^9
<br>
lightyears?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But an even stronger argument is this: it takes only *one* posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilization---or perhaps only one sufficiently advanced posthuman---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to colonize the rest of the universe.  Why is it so alluring to so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many people to imagine that somehow all posthuman value systems will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universally turn up their noses at this?  Especially when the ends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are so noble?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't agree the ends are so noble.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so you've said.  Just why you prefer Jupiter in its present
<br>
state to it being an abode for trillions of happy people/entities
<br>
you have *not* explained.
<br>
<p>But you have also not explained why since it would take only one
<br>
person/entity/civilization to bring life to the cosmos, NOT ONE
<br>
of them within a billion lightyears has done so (since the last
<br>
1/14 of the age of the universe).
