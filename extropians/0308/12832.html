</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  the limit on this line of reasoning though, is in the duration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the act .... for instance, say you were prescient, and saw a man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; who was going to mug you (with a knife) 10 minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; from now, and hit him over a head; then you would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; acting morally (given ur prescience).  Lets say you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not prescient, and you hit  him over the head on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; possibility that he might mug you; than you are acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; immorally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; In the real world, where our moral judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is supposed to assist us, (or at least that is my contention)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  we are *never* fully prescient and so there is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *some* chance the suspected or likely mugger may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in fact mug us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;Paul&gt; ....in real life, I generally prepare for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attack, rather than instigate a pre-emptive attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &lt;brett&gt; There a couple of ramifications to this. First you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave your pponent with more degrees of freedom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more power than if you take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the initiative. So you take on more risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; hardly; practically speaking, it means knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when to attack, and when not to attack (based on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies movements).
</em><br>
<p>Hey you've now come full circle if you are contemplating
<br>
when to attack (as opposed to merely preparing to defend)
<br>
you are accepting in some instance pre-emption. That was
<br>
the point I started with - sometimes pre-emption *is* moral,
<br>
it depends on the circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a fallacy to think that because you are reacting you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are necessarily @ a weaker advantage; more often than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the one moving with &quot;more degrees of freedom&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the disadvantage because so little is known (certain).
</em><br>
<p>I depends. With conventional military force they used
<br>
to argue it took three times as many men to storm
<br>
entrenched positions. But we are not just talking about
<br>
the civil war through to WWI   I presume. We're talking
<br>
about pre-emption and whether it is ever moral to act
<br>
pre-emptively. I am say of course it is *sometimes*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I just started reading sun tzu (a recent translation)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the art of war, and I am impressed with the clarity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his understanding of warfare. He reaches a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion; that most warfare is decided prior to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actual conflict, generally by skillful manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the situation (by a talented general) and by not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rushing foolishly into a situation where there are too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  many unknowns.
</em><br>
<p>Where heading off topic :-)  All things being equal
<br>
the clearer thinker, the better game theorist will win.
<br>
All things are not always equal. Sun Tzu also says
<br>
if a battle can't be won - don't fight it. This is not
<br>
to say surrender - it is to say choose a time and
<br>
terrain and circumstances of your chosing, or
<br>
hell why not even just negotiate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Second would you not agree that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances change when one has others under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones authority or control like a leader, a military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commander, or a president who has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to think in terms of minimising loss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life sometimes when the other is clearly intending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on taking life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; no :) I run my life like I would run an army :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is to say that my personal decisions affect all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those around me, and so, I take my actions seriously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I take pains to avoid unnecessary suffering, intentional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Not quite the same. As a military commander your would
<br>
give orders that you would know would result in the death
<br>
of some persons (your troops). They would not be partially
<br>
dead, their entire subjective universe is snuffed out. That
<br>
is a different proposition to running ones own life. That is
<br>
where hard moral decisions are needed and hard moral
<br>
judgements must be made. Because not to put ones
<br>
troops lives on the line (not to play God as it were) will
<br>
leave open in many cases the certainty of more loss of
<br>
life. We do not get to choose the all good option over
<br>
the all bad option or very rarely anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Assuming one values oneself, how can we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; otherwise than weigh up the chances as best we can?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My answer - we can't. Therefore the point becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how best we can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; learn to recognize (and avoid) abuse and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; abusive behaviors.. that includes learning not to abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others in an attempt to prevent said abuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Where this works and it often would its laudable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes though the abusive behavior cannot be avoided.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such is the human condition. Some folks will go out of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to remove the option of avoiding them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I'll agree with this statement; but they're attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  impose their presence on you despite your attempts to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid them is in and of itself  a declarative action;
</em><br>
<p>So now are you saying responding to declarative actions
<br>
is not really pre-emption. :-) What about when they don't
<br>
see the utility in telling you they are going to kill you, they
<br>
make no declaration, but go about the business of what
<br>
to you looks like taking all the necessary preparatory steps
<br>
do you then extend your notion of declarative action to
<br>
implied declarative action. I'm getting a sense of deja vu
<br>
all over again here :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I have no problem scratching an itch, preferably with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 10 pound sledgehammer.  I hate dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annoyances.
</em><br>
<p>Too silly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The irony of being free is that others are too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the person who decides to compete or predate on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one immediately reduces ones degrees of freedom. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-actor has less practical choices than the actor. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actor can compete, cooperate or ignore. The re-actor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be forced to compete (or be defeated), cooperate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not, but hardly ignore a person determined to compete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; hahaha :) I think that this is a fundamental difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between me and other people; I believe you can sedate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the things you hate; others do not.  Its come up on several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occassions.... Suffice it to say that in my case, I never ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to deal with people I don't want to deal with (law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforcement/violent  crime excepted sans prep time).
</em><br>
<p>Who said anything about hate? A lion doesn't hate a zebra,
<br>
the lion probably thinks zebras are delicious.
<br>
<p>A mugger may just want what you have and not want you to
<br>
report his face to the police - hate is not necessary.
<br>
<p>Sometimes one can disarm or passify or negotiate with an
<br>
aggressor but if you think you can do it all the time I think
<br>
you either have some remarkable strategies or you have
<br>
not really come up against a lion that thinks your a zebra.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; At this point I think its worth distinguishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; code, which may be a preconsidered framework that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one uses to help reach a particular moral judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and moral judgements per se.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; There are *no* moral codes that provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definitive answers to all the moral dilemmas that arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just as there are no maps on a scale of 1:1, therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  whenever a particular moral judgement is required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is no dodging that the subjective individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; must make it with or without the benefit of a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or less  sophisticated moral code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I see things in black and white;  I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a particularly sophisticated moral code; just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sophisticated world-view.  The rules themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are quite easy.  I might add that you can generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a complex world view from an array of black/white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; values... and if it is a matter of black and white
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; values, then my moral code does have a 1-to-1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correspondence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Then if you've codified to 1-to-1 (ie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predecided what you will do in all possible moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  dilemnas) then can the future not throw you a curly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one at all that will require you to make a new judgement?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt;  It isn't predecided; it is partitioned what is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what is bad in reference too different axis; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual selection of my own responses happens according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a simple ruleset that operates on these states.
</em><br>
<p>So you haven't codied 1-1, you use guidelines, not an
<br>
entirely proscriptive code.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Practically speaking, I am very rarely thrust into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situtations that can't be analyzed .... and yield a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfactory action.  In fact, I am fully capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generating (apparent) conflicting actions when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with seperate parties which are in reality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; united under a  general operating principle..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Generally such instances are preceded by, &quot;if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was in your shoes...&quot;  The closest I come to moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crisis is what I would term &quot;games&quot;;  generally they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are very abstract points that have not had resolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  yet based on my experiences;  they fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alter the set of possible outcomes :)
</em><br>
<p>Game theory is a rich source of inspiration for reason
<br>
based morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; For instance say that IVF technology was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  improved to the point that a given embryo was more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  likely to go through to a health birth than the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  than 70% from  memory that naturally abort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; What would be your moral position if you were a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superior court judge and a state governement wanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pass a law that all reproduction should be via IVF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as that wasted less embryos than reproduction by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural method. Would your moral code cover that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - with the consequence that all sex for pleasure must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involve careful steps to avoid reckless and risky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procreation or would you have to think anew guided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by your moral code perhaps but not being able to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a one to one look up to say point 356 of your specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; it depends; are you asking me as a person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or me as a citizen responsible for crafting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy to be inflicted (and I choose inflicted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on purpose) on others...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; if you ask me as a person; I would say present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your evidence and I *may* choose to do as u wish;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this case I am *already* planning on procreating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through IVF :)   If you ask me as a citizen crafting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy, I would say, nobody has a right to limit how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you choose to procreate, short of physical rape (e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date rape is crap IMHO).
</em><br>
<p>No these are not what I was asking you. I put you in
<br>
the position of a superior court judge and posited you
<br>
the responsibility of deciding policy that would affect
<br>
others (a whole state).
<br>
<p>I said the fact of the matter is that natural conceptions
<br>
will result in 70% loss of embryos through natural
<br>
abortion but by using a new positied form of IVF
<br>
this could be got down to below 70% and as
<br>
a consequence one state wanted to make sex by
<br>
the natural means illegal in deference to the rights
<br>
of embryos.
<br>
<p>They are the facts of the case presented to you how
<br>
will you rule as a judge what law will you make for
<br>
that state?
<br>
<p>You might resign or excuse yourself from the case
<br>
but if the case is brought up *someone* is going to
<br>
decide it, you not deciding just means someone else
<br>
will.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lets say you are not prescient, and he is mugging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; someone else (as it is apparent to you from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; vantage point), and you intervene by hitting him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; over the head... Then you're actions may or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not be immoral, on the basis that he may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the one doing the mugging, but rather, may be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; muggee.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; ...the  proper action is to act to separate them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without harming one party or the another precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because you are ill-informed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Hmm. I'm around 6 foot, weight around 90 kilo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and am a former state karate champion. Yet there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  some males that are so much stronger than me that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be able to separate them as you say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; we have a saying in egyptian; &quot;the army teaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to improvise&quot;.... can't seperate them, locate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources that will enable you to seperate them;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this may be police, threatening to run them both down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they don't stop, or calling for nearby passengers :)
</em><br>
<p>Hey hang on, it was your example above I was replying
<br>
to. You said intervening in a mugging by hitting the person
<br>
I think is the mugger over the head is morally wrong if I
<br>
mistakely identify the mugger. A hit over the head is doable
<br>
with minimal strenght as opposed to wrestling two males
<br>
apart.
<br>
<p>You point out below the army and the police may use
<br>
the resources at hand to break up a situation. By hitting
<br>
the person I think is the mugger over the head that is
<br>
exactly what I would have done.
<br>
<p>The only difference is whose judgement is used. Mine or
<br>
the police or the armies. My point is that in agreement
<br>
with your next paragraph sometime I have to decide
<br>
'cause I'm the only one there. Its not immoral to make
<br>
it mistake, it may be unfortunate and it may be illegal
<br>
(if my judgement really stinks) but you can hardly accuse
<br>
me of immorality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am a firm believer that the reason why life sucks is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that most people do not do their duty in establishing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable operating environment;  sometimes the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not available, and you have a duty in ceasing harmful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities in progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Yet as a third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; party coming onto the scene with them grappling with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other I would in all likelihood be able to render on or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other unconscious having the advantage of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element of surprise (as indeed could my youngest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sister, who is much lighter and has no special training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any martial arts, if she kept her wits about her).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Your scenario contains details for you that I didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see. Those details change the context. One must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act in real time within the context with the options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one has. If the two protagonists were school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boys then separating them might be relatively easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and involve only words. It depends.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; well I've been thrust into that situation on several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occassions :) and I've never had a problem... granted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no weapons were involved.  That also included random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strangers btw :)  The point is to stop the escalation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without being partial to either of the combatants, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you realize that you are *NOT* in full possession of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts.
</em><br>
<p>So if someone is mugging someone else and your not
<br>
sure who is who do you supervise the splitting of the
<br>
wallet's contents 50/50 :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously, we are recovering ground. The point is
<br>
we must make judgements and if they are judgements
<br>
made on best endeavours in the circumstances they
<br>
are not immoral though they could be foolish or illegal.
<br>
The point is to thine ownself we must be true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You should have a duty (under your moral code)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to negotiate in good faith, and having said that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you have an obligation to do due diligence in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attempt to (as completely as possible) understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the situation.  Properly exercised restraint is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remarkeably under-appreciated quality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Agreed. But &quot;due&quot; diligence depends on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances. Too much diligence, too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forebearance is also a risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; agreed; there is a time for action; I would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; err on the side of too much diligence than too less.
</em><br>
<p>You thinking on the personal one crisis at a time scale.
<br>
On the larger stage too much due diligence on problem
<br>
A can leave you unable to give enough due diligence to
<br>
problem B.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The weighting of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risks is a moral judgement that the individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot get away from as no code can fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipate all contingencies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I shift the preponderance of the work towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishing the environment you are in (accurately);
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so my moral code is simple and complete :) [ergo sophisiticated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world-view statement above].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can't have a good moral code if you're judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is consistently unable to judge according to that moral code..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I think I see your point. A better code, one that endorses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning rather than believing as a means to making decisions, is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better guide to moral behavior, but we can never have a code so good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the need for moral judgments disappear altogether unless there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no new challenges thrown at us, like the challenges that technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might throw up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; its more basic than that; its an age-old systems problem; if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system is theoretically perfect, but always implemented poorly (due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent errors),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can it really be considered theoretically perfect?
</em><br>
<p>You misunderstood I think. I meant (1) I see your point that a good
<br>
moral code is not good if it doesn't produce consistent judgements.
<br>
<p>The I went on to say why I thought reasoning was a better
<br>
component to include in a moral code than believing. I was trying
<br>
to get back to the particulars of the moral code I was proposing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; [snip]... But the brighter more abstract thinkers that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to rise to positions of power are more likely to be better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract thinkers and reasoners. (They may also be better rationalizers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on occassion but a rationalization is a deceit one practices on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneself). Your rationalisation won't convince me and vice versa. You or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can have a moral discussion and seek to change each others views using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason and a common language but if either of us held that we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely right to believe what we believe then there would be little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility of communication and cooperation between us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; first; I would say that abstract thinkers do not have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency to rise to positions of power anymore than anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else;
</em><br>
<p>In corporations and governments etc. They do. The ability to
<br>
manage people is the most complex managerial task. If someone
<br>
can manage people at a high level in one organisation that are
<br>
often able to manage people at a high level in another. At the
<br>
lower levels of management it knowledge of the product or
<br>
service and the means of producing these matters more. At
<br>
the higher this has been delegated. I don't know how to prove
<br>
this to you (I don't know what you know about management
<br>
and organisational behavior) but I am confident that this is so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; second; I would say it depends on whether or not the agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;thinking that they were absolutely right&quot; thought that naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implied that the search for disproof was pointless or not...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for instance, if you asked me to hold a conversation on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not 2+2 = 4 in decimal arithmetic as its currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  defined, I would probably not choose to engage in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; if you asked me if 2+2 = 4 in all cases, I would,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because their you *may* be talking about some unifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle irrespective of any particular algebra (ergo 2+2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be equal to 4 &gt; in all cases is a true (and absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct) statement,
</em><br>
<p>One could play word games with what symbols mean to
<br>
different cultures but the conversation would be short. The
<br>
core point I'd be interested in is the referents not the words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but you may be discussing a particular aspect of it that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be at a  higher level than the statement itself).
</em><br>
<p>Unless you've gone Godelian on me, I've missed your
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt;Clearly it is absurb to argue that a cancer cell or a multiples
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of them are of moral weight with a person dying of cancer. Yet this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not much of an exaggeration beyond the proposition that say all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; embryos are a form of human life when by human life what is obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meant is personhood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ... I understand the distinction between women as life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support for a fetus and a fetus as collection of foreign cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a parasitic arrangement with its hosts :)
</em><br>
<p>But your not a congressman :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; suffice it to say that in certain cases, a cancer cell may actually be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more valuable than the host it is living on... but that follows from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (reasonable) assumption that we're all going to die anyway :)
</em><br>
<p>Hang on maybe I spoke to soon you aren't on the President's Bioethics
<br>
Committee are you ;-)
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Before laws can be set that codify legally what may and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may not be done it is prudent to have a moral disucssion where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words we use do not obfuscate the reals issues at hand. Issues such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how does a civil society weight the rights or potential persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (embryos, fetus etc at different stages). When we do not decide or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; address these questions public policy continues to be made on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the basis of outdated moral and legal codes. And persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suffer needlessly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I would agree :)  ergo my suggestion for a clear, unambivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tending towards reserving the right for any person to make their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral decisions rather than a state.  If it lives, its a human being...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it dies, it is not.  If god wanted it to be considered a human being,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he would have helped it live :)
</em><br>
<p>You don't live in Salem do you ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Yes. And if we consider that each of us is a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we get to &quot;to thine ownself be true&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; well we agree on that part :)
</em><br>
<p>Then perhaps to move this along why don't you recap based on
<br>
my recap what we don't in your view agree on.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Agreed. Interestingly though legal systems do seem to put a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formal emphasis on reasoning and the processes by which conclusions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reached.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; thats incidental; legal systems generally attempt to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountable; that requires consistency,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and consistency can only come from particular formal systems (past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; draconion kill everyone statements) :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Juries work to beyond &quot;reasonable&quot; doubt standards not to mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;belief&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; but fundamentally juries decision of reasonable doubt or not is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief on their parts..
</em><br>
<p>Certain Knowlege    Probably    Improbably        No idea.
<br>
&nbsp;100%                         &gt;50%       &lt;50%                  0%
<br>
<p>The above is a scale that can have more precision added with utility.
<br>
<p>The word belief can mean anything from this is what the priest told
<br>
me and I trust him to I've checked this and its statistically significant to
<br>
9 decimal places but I'm still not sure. If an audience is hearing two
<br>
people describe their views and the above two both use the description
<br>
I believe the second person has forfeit a huge advantage in pursuading
<br>
the audience to the vastly more probable truth.
<br>
<p>Belief is too crude a word. To blunt an instrument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Its been argued that all academic disciplines are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descendants of philosophy. I am interested in philosophy not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  because it it esoteric though it can be but because it can suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions to problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; historically speaking, likely :) theoretically speaking, math is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy (IMHO, but only because I would like to be accurate) :)
</em><br>
<p>Where do you put Pythagorus, Archimedes, Euclid?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; .... I would rather talk to a person who has rederived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the philosophers works independantly, rather than someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  has adopted them based on extensive reading of said philosophers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and ergo, has not really contributed to them).
</em><br>
<p>Personally I'm looking for ideas that work.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; On the specific point I would say that my code
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would say that self delusion is immoral. Thats what I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endeavor to teach children but I'd also point out that its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural and in some circumstances moral judgements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that take in the fuller context and detail than any moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  code (that is codified) are going to be refinements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I would endeavor to teach children above all else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sure its functional; always search for an objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure to test for ur situation, and always attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to find optimal solutions that do not unnecesarily inflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needless suffering for others, nor impose needless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  limitations on urself.  And have fun :)
</em><br>
<p>So the kid asks you: what do you mean functional in terms
<br>
of rights and wrong? Why should I search for an objective
<br>
method? What is an objective method anyway? Is it needless
<br>
if my sister is being a real pest?
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Now thats the moral code. The reason for the moral code is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that usually judgements will be required in real life which one cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anticipate and the better, the more sophisticated your moral code the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better, (the more enlightened) your judgement of your own best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interests will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; again I balk at the requirement for a sophisticated moral code;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can have an incredibly simple moral code; but apply it through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use of a sophisticated world view (ergo ur judgement).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs scale (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplest) may not do something that is good for society in general but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for far more basic reasons, than a person who is reasoning at level 5.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or abstraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and nuance are likely to influence your code. I would think that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person would have a hard time having a complex moral code without having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ability to use language for instance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our leaders must make judgements that will have impacts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on lives other than their own. The more of us that are reasoners and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical thinkers and the fewer of us that are mere believers the better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the healthier) we will be as a society in my opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; In the vast majority of cases self-delusion *is* going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; harmful. In those circumstances where it is not harmful to anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; including the person who is self-deluded then I'd agree it not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immoral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; ok well then we've settled that line of logic :)
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [Brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is where I think it becomes important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to acknowledge to oneself that one can be rational and that one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by nature social. If one does not acknowledge that one is social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one is not (by my reckoning) being true to oneself and one does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not have the sort of maturity that will enable one to be on good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terms with oneself and to form real compacts that have a chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being honored with others.
