<em>&gt; This would gruesomely hilarious if our possible future lives 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hadn't been put at risk by this vile prat. 
</em><br>
<p>So Larry Johnson was employed for a couple of months as
<br>
Alcors Chief Operasting Officer, what was he doing before
<br>
hand I wonder?
<br>
<p>I do not know whether the statement that &quot;....this company 
<br>
...indulged in activities .... including capital offenses against
<br>
the laws of our society&quot; is true or not. 
<br>
<p>If it is not true, I think there is a very good chance that Larry
<br>
Johnson has libelled himself.  If he spends a cent on anything
<br>
other than what he claims he is raising the money for then their
<br>
is also the question of fraud. 
<br>
<p>There may be legal grounds to get the offending material
<br>
removed. Alcor clearly needs legal advice. 
<br>
<p>Politically, of course, things are more complex. A legal battle
<br>
would generate publicity which is apparently Johnson's intent
<br>
and might throw brear rabbit into the briar patch, if it were 
<br>
poorly handled. 
<br>
<p>It might also yet be managed to Alcor and cryonics net 
<br>
benefit depending on the facts. But the media as well as
<br>
the courts are the battleground on which this matter would
<br>
be fought out.  I don't know the facts.
