On Sat, 16 Aug 2003, Alex Future Bokov asked about how to
<br>
spread the memes without blowing &quot;belief&quot; fuses...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not particularly good memetics to use the L-word (life extension) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; front of faculty members.
</em><br>
<p>Well, citing an article in Science will have a pretty good impact
<br>
on any serious faculty member [1].  As will pointing out the number
<br>
of companies now working on aging [2].  And a serious attack
<br>
on the conditions associated with aging (such as Aubrey has
<br>
developed [3]) will tend to silence the objections of those
<br>
more educated in medicine.  Its not a question of &quot;if&quot; but &quot;when&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let alone make fun of Christianity... especially in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Texas of all places. They don't believe me.
</em><br>
<p>One way to spin this is to point out that we aren't talking about
<br>
&quot;immortality&quot; (that is what tends to blow the &quot;belief&quot; fuses I
<br>
think).  Much better to point out that we are talking about extending
<br>
healthful life (gerotologists call this making the longevity
<br>
curve &quot;rectangular&quot;).  As Damien pointed out in the Spike and Robert
<br>
Freitas pointed out at a recent Alcor conference [4] (and was obvious
<br>
to me back at Extro3 so many years ago...) you cannot beat the hazard
<br>
function (at least not as humans are currently instantiated).  Probably
<br>
the best you can do is something like 2000-7000 years unless you
<br>
really push on the hazard function by reengineering the human body
<br>
with nanotechnology and even then it is still very very difficult
<br>
to trump the hazard function.
<br>
<p>(So by preserving the meme that one &quot;will&quot; die, you don't have
<br>
to break the entire christianity/death/salvation meme-set.
<br>
One simply replaces the concept of a death that may be prolonged
<br>
and painful with the image of a much longer life -- where one gets
<br>
to enjoy ones great-great-great grandchildren and a probable end
<br>
which might be painful but will probably be quick, e.g. car accident
<br>
or something similar).
<br>
<p>Now the thousands of years concept may be a stretch.  I once did a
<br>
calculation on the best estimates I could find of loss of brain
<br>
neurons and the numbers I got were much less (hundreds of years if I recall).
<br>
So unless we get stem cell replacement of neurons on a regular basis all
<br>
bets may be off much sooner (so long as one doesn't mention &quot;uploading&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anybody have suggestions on how I could communicate the need for nuance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diplomacy, and picking one's battles to these well-meaning but slightly naive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; youngsters? Some example, some object lesson that would resonate with people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who overestimate the degree to which the 'normal' world gets the big picture?
</em><br>
<p>A very, very long time ago, I took a course as part of my &quot;enlightenment&quot;
<br>
process -- one of the things that stuck in my mind was the statement:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never destroy someone's belief system unless you are committed to replacing it&quot;.
<br>
(Or something to that effect.)  The emphasis is on your personal commitment
<br>
to *replacing* the belief system -- a very very hard thing to do -- one
<br>
must essentially reprogram a human mind which probably has years of experience.
<br>
<p>It is a very powerful concept.  People construct their lives around their
<br>
beliefs.  Why?  Because their beliefs have allowed them to survive until the
<br>
current day.  Destroy someones beliefs and you might as well have cast them
<br>
adrift in a Class 5 hurricane [5].  So it is relatively important to present
<br>
ideas in a way that is compatible with pre-existing belief systems.  As new
<br>
ideas become more commonplace (consider for example the impact the Matrix
<br>
series will have on society) then the older ideas will be discarded
<br>
(witness gay bishops being elected by the Anglican church for example).
<br>
<p>[I'm not stating that the Matrix led to the election of a gay bishop --
<br>
they are separate vectors -- I'm simply commenting on how beliefs can
<br>
and will change over time -- but it is very difficult to &quot;force&quot; the
<br>
process.]
