</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  What I am saying is not that nothing gets done but that a
<br>
lot of foreign aid is internal wealth redistribution.  I should NOT have
<br>
used the Iraq War as an example, since it's too politically charged, so
<br>
let me just used a schematic example.  Country X allegedly gives aid to
<br>
country Y.  The aid is for a specific project P.  Well connected
<br>
interests C inside X lobbied for this specific project and the aid
<br>
really amounts to the taxpayers of X pay C to do P.  Yes, Y gets P, but
<br>
the real pressure to do P did not come the citizens of X per se but from
<br>
special interests in X that saw a way to get the aid money transferred
<br>
to them.
<br>
<p>This kind of thing goes on, I bet, a good percentage of the time when it
<br>
comes to foreign aid -- and I'm not focusing on the current Bush
<br>
Administration or the US or wartime.  There seems to be a good public
<br>
choice argument for why this stuff would go on -- the incentive for C (a
<br>
tiny minority) to lobby for P is much higher than the incentive for the
<br>
rest of X (the ones who, in the end, pay for P) to monitor it or fight
<br>
against it.  After all, P might amount to thousands or more in profit
<br>
for each C while it costs each taxpayer only pennies.
<br>
<p>There's also a knowledge problem here too.  Since P is going on in a
<br>
foreign land, its even more difficult for those taxpayers to monitor.
<br>
The same difficulty applies to politicians who sign on to P in the
<br>
motherland.  (For all we know, P might not really benefit people in Y or
<br>
its benefits could be uneven, destabilizing, or even counterproductive.
<br>
An example might be food donations that bankrupt many marginal farmers
<br>
in Y.)
<br>
<p>Later!
