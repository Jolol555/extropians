<p>
A later development along these same lines came in
<br>
college.  I was studying some leaf in connection with
<br>
biology or something and suddenly realized that when I
<br>
looked at the leaf, I was only seeing the surface.  It
<br>
suddenly occurred to me to try to mentally internalize
<br>
the leaf structure and function so that when I looked
<br>
at it, my thoughts would be focused not on the visable
<br>
image, but on the actual 4-Dimensional leaf.  As I did
<br>
so, I felt as though I were somehow sinking into the
<br>
structure of the leaf, and losing something of my own
<br>
separated identity as I visualized the complete
<br>
perceptual/conceptual me/leaf system.
<br>
<p>For the next several weeks, I went around picking
<br>
stuff up and staring at it, imagining that I could
<br>
somehow see into its internal structure, hefting it
<br>
around, feeling the textures, the smell, ect., it an
<br>
effort to &quot;grok&quot; all kinds of things, not in any sense
<br>
of imagining that I COULD actually miraculously see in
<br>
the Xray range, but as a very pleasurable exercise in
<br>
extending the integration of perceptual and cognitive,
<br>
and, as experiencing myself extending beyond the
<br>
discrete boundaries of skin, into the system of
<br>
relationships that made &quot;me&quot; possible.
<br>
<p>I had never, BTW, used any kind of mind-altering drugs
<br>
up to that point - except for caffiene, nicotine,
<br>
alcohol.  My later couple of years of extensive
<br>
experimentation with mariuana and other psychodelics
<br>
was largely aimed at refining that function and
<br>
getting past all the mental screens and filters,
<br>
reworking them into something more objective than the
<br>
simple inherited memes of childhood.  I could be
<br>
wrong, but I am convinced that most people are still
<br>
stuck on &quot;surfaces.&quot;  
<br>
<p>The extrema of this come in areas like interpersonal
<br>
relationships, in which people learn how to &quot;be&quot; what
<br>
other people want, developing a persona that fits
<br>
either what some lover, parent, etc., wants to see, or
<br>
following some extreme rule-based or
<br>
rule+fashion-based program.  Such people are so
<br>
blocked in seeing what they are, in part because it
<br>
never occurs to them that there IS any alternative,
<br>
that they find real emotional interaction
<br>
incomprehensible and/or terrifying.  So they legislate
<br>
away anything that challenges their myopic
<br>
2-dimensional perspective.  And, mostly they elect the
<br>
people to power who are best at maintaining &quot;face.&quot;  
<br>
<p>(The Chinese, of course, base a whole culture on
<br>
&quot;face,&quot; i.e., lies, power, deception.  Try telling
<br>
truth to power in China.  So, there is hope for our
<br>
culture at least - altho, given the right inputs,
<br>
China, with a much worse case of the problem, might
<br>
actually be able to better isolate it and turn it
<br>
around radically.  I'm working on that one.)
<br>
<p>Realizing this, I began to program myself to take the
<br>
opposite approach.  For several years, whatever
<br>
fashion or social norms demanded, I would try to
<br>
eliminate from my behavior and mental focus.  (I
<br>
suspect that many people thought I was extremely weird
<br>
during that phase.)  
<br>
<p>I had been programmed by my neurotic religious
<br>
fundamentalist parents to avoid &quot;evil thoughts,&quot; and
<br>
this extended of course to the sin of gazing at a
<br>
woman with sexual desire.  Once, when I must have been
<br>
about 10, I was at Sunday School when this whole
<br>
little clique of girls came giggling into the room,
<br>
and, as on some pre-arranged signal, all grabbed the
<br>
bottom edges of their dresses and pulled them up to
<br>
their chins, like a Lolitan Can Can line.  Underneath,
<br>
they were all wearing shorts, for some athletic event
<br>
later, but I didn't know that.  I literally almost
<br>
fainted in shock, the room spinning around me, my
<br>
heart pounding, nausea, etc.
<br>
<p>So, I began the habit of reacting to any feeling that
<br>
I needed to avert my eyes, to doing just the opposite,
<br>
getting a lot of angry looks in the process from women
<br>
as I studied their crotches or breasts - or faces. 
<br>
(Four billion years of evolution looks awfully damned
<br>
good from here...)
<br>
<p>Philosophically, in parallel, I developed the habit of
<br>
thinking the unthinkable.  If some conclusion were
<br>
wrong, then I should be able to identify WHY, not just
<br>
slam down the mental shutters against considering it. 
<br>
Child-rape is bad?  Well, let's just assume the
<br>
negative, imagine exactly what that would be like,
<br>
whatever kinky pleasures might be involved, and then
<br>
ask, is it really bad or not?  What contradictions
<br>
emerge from that assumption?  (I leave that exercise
<br>
to the reader.)  Suicide is scary.  So, seriously
<br>
consider suicide at least once a day.
<br>
<p>The result, after quite a few years of sometimes scary
<br>
or miserable experiences, was that I developed what
<br>
seems to be an extraordinary basic confidence in
<br>
myself as a sentient being.  I don't claim to be a
<br>
genius - and what would any such relative present day
<br>
measure matter when we develop our successors, anyway,
<br>
comes the singularity? - but I can ultimately
<br>
understand any particular thing that I need to, I'm
<br>
reasonably convinced, altho not necesarilly as quickly
<br>
as I need to.  And I have NO need to refer to
<br>
authority of ANY kind as an unquestioned source of
<br>
truth.
