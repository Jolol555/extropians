<p><em>&gt;        ##Robbie, it sounds as if you have an agenda that you haven't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the house.  In addition you are making gratuitous statements 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offering either evidence or basis.
</em><br>
<p>Ever see the &quot;Buy an SUV, ride with Osama&quot; bumper sticker?
<br>
<p>If I have an agenda here it is this - that the political issues 
<br>
involved in creating &quot;better societies&quot; far outweigh the technical 
<br>
issues.  It's possible that these political issues don't need to be 
<br>
resolved in order to create a better world for a few people.  The 
<br>
question then would be whether or not that was a worthy goal?  This 
<br>
topic is being covered elsewhere.
<br>
<p>As for basis, in the sense that it's clear that the American monetary 
<br>
system commits us to a hawkish foreign policy (and that the hawkish 
<br>
foreign policy commits us to this monetary system) it equally makes us 
<br>
all severally and jointly responsible for the war-time and peace-time 
<br>
atrocities committed in the advancement of that project.
<br>
<p>I don't think this should come as a surprise to anyone - it's as nearly 
<br>
tautological as anything meta-economic could be - the largest financial 
<br>
institutions have the majority stakes in each of the major 
<br>
corporations.  Nothing new at all.
<br>
<p>I am in complete agreement with you that we SHOULDN'T buy products 
<br>
produced with slave-labor.  Where I slightly disagree with you is 
<br>
whether or not that's possible.  Given, for instance, that FMR, 
<br>
Barclays, Citigroup and a few others are the largest corporate owners 
<br>
of both GM and Nike, it means that supporting GM is supporting Nike by 
<br>
extension.
<br>
<p>I suggest a brief study of the S &amp; P 500 would give you the data you 
<br>
need to understand this problem.  If you haven't got the time to go 
<br>
through the corporate ownership pyramid, try:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt">http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt</a>
<br>
<p>Gathered from finance.yahoo.com institutional ownership records.
<br>
<p>The data is a little out of date, but if you add it up, you'll see what 
<br>
I mean, it hasn't changed that much.  The fields are:
<br>
<p>Company
<br>
Owner (Institutional Ownership only NOT mutual funds)
<br>
Percentage Owned	
<br>
Value
<br>
<p>If you add them up the same way I did, you'll see that the largest 
<br>
institutions, the usual suspects, own both the BAD companies and the 
<br>
GOOD companies.  If you widen your research, you find that they own 
<br>
them both in the US and abroad.
<br>
<p>The numbers were taken from Yahoo! Finance late last year.
<br>
<p>Now given that the FED (you know, the federal reserve system) gives 
<br>
great competetive advantage to american financial institutions (doubt 
<br>
me, check
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        ###Did I mention magic?  I suggested that you have here a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of very intelligent and knowledgeable people.  These people can spread 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the meme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of not buying the products of slave labor.  They also can keep up with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the slavemasters are.
</em><br>
<p>Good point.  What should we do about FMR, Barclays, Janus, JP Morgan, 
<br>
etc.?

<p><p><em>&gt; I am sure a phone call to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international union headquarters would get you a list that would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astounding for its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completeness.
</em><br>
<p>Unless you count corporate ownership relationships.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to your insinuation that we don't have choice I have never had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a salesclerk point a firearm at me and dictate what product choices I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you MUST take a car to work, then you MUST buy gas.  If it 
<br>
turns out that Gas is only available from a small number of very 
<br>
dangerous sources, then what choice do you have, you HAVE to go to 
<br>
work, right?  You gotta eat?  I mean you could drop out of society all 
<br>
together, but what good would that do?
<br>
<p>If you MUST eat, then you MUST buy wheat-proucts.  Who do you think 
<br>
consistently sets the price of wholesale wheat in the US?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the last thing we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need is another layer of big brother looking out for us.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, no one is proposing another layer, if I were to make a proposal 
<br>
it would be the elimination of the corporate ownership system as we 
<br>
know it today by making liability transparent - if you OWN something 
<br>
that does something evil, you should be liable for that economically 
<br>
and criminally.  BUT that would assume that I thought that something 
<br>
could really be done - on that particular issue I am agnostic - the 
<br>
proof is in the pudding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All we have to do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember we are leaders and start being leaders.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds easy.  How do you propose to start?
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
