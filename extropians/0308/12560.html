I would hazard a guess to say the unfolding of a 
<br>
natural ability.  Mind you, everyone can benefit
<br>
to some degree from previsualization; I think the
<br>
difference between normal people and hyperlexic
<br>
people who have successfully encapsulated a sensitive
<br>
propiocentric system with the equivalent of a mental
<br>
grammer is the speed in which they both acquire new
<br>
skills, and maintain old skills.  Its a biological equivalent
<br>
to a skillsoft (software acquired skills).. There is,
<br>
also as another aside, a remarkably interesting subgenera
<br>
of this type of programming, but based off of biofeedback
<br>
training.
<br>
<p>I ran across some really interesting research as it relates
<br>
to conceiving of new ideas by some Russian scientist which
<br>
sought to qualify how creative people come up with solutions
<br>
to well-known problems... I have it saved somewhere. I'm
<br>
planning on core-dumping all my research on a website @
<br>
some point.

Subject: Hyperlexia
<br>
<p><p>What Paul was saying about kinesthetic sense is very
<br>
close to my experience as well.  I &quot;feel&quot; statements
<br>
in a kind of internal universe as solid entities with
<br>
weighted connections to other objects.  I also have
<br>
substantial ability to program my muscles, altho I may
<br>
have acquired that, rather than being born with some
<br>
special ability.
<br>
<p>Around or just before 1960 I think it was that I read
<br>
Maxwell Maltz's excellent &quot;Psycho-Cybernetics.&quot;  There
<br>
were two parts that I really put to use.  
<br>
<p>Philosophically, his discussion of how our concepts
<br>
influence our reactions to perception - if you think
<br>
it's a man in a bear suit on a lonely trail at night,
<br>
you will behave very differently than if you think
<br>
it's really a bear, etc.  It tied directly into what I
<br>
was getting from Rand when I read &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; in
<br>
1960 at age 12, when she discussed how people have
<br>
difficulty even conceiving of challenging their value
<br>
systems.  Why?  Largely because they have
<br>
shortcircuited the cognitive process by accepting
<br>
their values as givens, rather than conclusions to be
<br>
verified and challenged on the basis of data and
<br>
logic.  Maltz gave another perspective to the same
<br>
line of argument, which I always find useful.
<br>
<p>(One of the most useful takes on problem solving that
<br>
I've ever come across came out of basic algebra.  If
<br>
you have n variables and m independent equations, then
<br>
the solution space has n-m dimensions, roughly
<br>
speaking (forgetting quadratics, etc., obviously).  In principle,
<br>
getting a wide variety of takes on an issue, and looking for the
<br>
commonalities and contradictions among them can often yield more precise
<br>
and unexpected answers than an exhaustive analysis following a single
<br>
thread, altho both approaches certainly have their place.  Given the
<br>
fuzziness of data so often in real world situations, additional
<br>
independent perspectives are often invaluable to getting manageable
<br>
solution spaces.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, the 2nd thing I got from Maltz was his take on visualization.  I
<br>
picked right up on that and found an immediate practical application -
<br>
knot tieing.  I was active in rural Boy Scouts and a big part of our
<br>
somewhat impoverished troup life was taken up in acquiring relatively
<br>
costless proficiencies in areas like carving or knot tieing. I learned
<br>
that if I practiced Maltz's visualization that I could learn really
<br>
complex knots and learn how to do them really, really fast, which was
<br>
important, as a big use of knot tieing was in competitions judgeing both
<br>
correctness and speed.
<br>
<p>At a summer camp, I recall learning a pair of complex
<br>
knots I had never seen before while waiting in line to
<br>
perform them in inter-troup competition.  I visualized
<br>
every little step in tieing them in complete detail as
<br>
I moved up the line, and, fifteen or so minutes later,
<br>
I matched the camp record, even though I had literally
<br>
never seen either knot in my life.  But I was just
<br>
playing back a tape in my head essentially.  
<br>
<p>The method also turned out to work rather well in judo
<br>
later in college, especially in getting out of jams,
<br>
as I could completely visualize my coming moves and
<br>
then execute them as a batch job, much faster than any
<br>
opponent could respond.  It did not work very well in
<br>
karate, however, where instantaneous response is key.
<br>
<p>So, the question is, did I learn a kind of basic
<br>
kinesthetic approach from those experiences, or was it
<br>
simply the unfolding of a natural ability?
