</em><br>
<p>I do realize that, but what you who mention only faults don't realize is
<br>
that you are indistinguishable from the chomskyite
<br>
everything-the-US-has-done-is-absolutely-evil kind of person.  When you
<br>
hear nothing but criticisms, what evidence do we have to suggest that
<br>
you have anything to say other than criticisms?
<br>
<p>Regardless, and just to clear this up, I think many of the complaints
<br>
waged against the US govt are valid.  I would most accurately be
<br>
considered a minarchist libertarian, so I obviously oppose liberal
<br>
paternalism and socialism, and conservative lack of respect for
<br>
individual freedoms.  Additionally, I oppose the war on drugs and
<br>
incarceration perpetrators of victimless crimes.  The occurrence and
<br>
presence of these things really bothers me, but so do the atrocities
<br>
that occur in other countries, which are often far far worse.  
<br>
<p>As far as free countries go, I consider most of the post-industrialized
<br>
west close enough to not really be worth troubling myself over the
<br>
differences while other egregious differences are present in the
<br>
industrial and pre-industrial countries of the world.  If I could live
<br>
anywhere I wanted, Id probably first pick Hong Kong (but would end up
<br>
moving soon as the Chinese took control again) second would be a close
<br>
runner up between the US and Australia.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That being said, I too found Damiens posting a bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;insensitive&quot; in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light of the recent developments on the list.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't find it 'insensitive' per se, just wanted to put perspective on
<br>
it relative to other world atrocities.  I found it very interesting that
<br>
the article was judging the incarceration rates of populations of the
<br>
world.  Interesting, I thought, I wonder how they got accurate data from
<br>
notoriously closed and oppressive societies?  If they were saying the US
<br>
has the highest incarceration rate in the world, surely they actually
<br>
looked at the rest of the world.  
<br>
<p>Upon further investigation, that was obviously not the case.  As noted,
<br>
Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma, East Timor, North Korea etc. for a total of 17
<br>
countries had NO data present to compare.  Yet the CS Monitor did not
<br>
find this noteworthy enough to even mention in their article.  It should
<br>
have read &quot;US has highest incarceration rate of the countries who would
<br>
tell us theirs, the notoriously worse countries incarceration rates are
<br>
unknown&quot;
