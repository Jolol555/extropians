Mitch quotes from  <a href="http://www.reason.com/links/links073003.shtml">http://www.reason.com/links/links073003.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take this howler from IBM spokeswoman, Kendra R. Collins,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not about one shore or another shore. It's about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investing around the world, including the United States,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to build capability and deliver value as defined by our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customers.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it's about working the cost side of balance sheet in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;search of profits; revenues have been flat for two years
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and show little sign of improving. This is what good
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;managers do, and there is no reason to be ashamed of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it if you truly think you are going to make the company
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stronger. 
<br>
<p>Well, that's what I would say too.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the catch is that out-sourcing is being embraced without
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much sign that it will actually make high-tech firms,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particularly software companies, more effective. Highly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collaborative, imaginative work might suffer in the hands
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of technically adept but inexperienced programmers. 
<br>
<p>Okay, the market place is smarter, MUCH smarter than all of
<br>
us.  Let it sort it out.  If this is true, then the companies
<br>
that send the work to India will on average not do so well---
<br>
so the capitalists and entrepreneurs should be encouraged to
<br>
follow their own profit seeking instincts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ron h &amp; Mitch-- two pro-capitalists, who know that corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ass-licking has worked for centuries as the easiest means to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve; but that ass-licking doesn't bake bread or micro-chips! :-D
</em><br>
<p>But it hasn't worked in the West for centuries!  What
<br>
has worked has been thousands of small time entrepreneurs
<br>
(like my boss) or the genius Rockefellers, Morgans, and
<br>
Fords.  That has been what has worked.
<br>
<p>Your mission, should you choose to undertake, is to explain
<br>
what is different now.  Government regulation?  Failing
<br>
character values among socialized pampered Americans?
<br>
As usual, the secretary will disavow any knowledge of
<br>
your mission.  Good luck Mitch.
<br>
<p>Lee
