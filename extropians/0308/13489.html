<p>Fine, if it will make you feel any better, you can have my answers:
<br>
<p>Yes
<br>
Yes
<br>
No
<br>
<p>Is knowing my opinion on this subject of any value to you?  It hardly seems
<br>
so.  Now you *might* be interested in the *book* I'd have to write to
<br>
explain myself to you.  But then there's the bandwidth thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not like I'm asking you to analyze the structure of human freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in its cultural dimension across temporal and sociological borders or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something.
</em><br>
<p>But, really, you are, because that's the only way I can explain my answers.
<br>
And such an exercise is precisely what I'm saying isn't really appropriate
<br>
here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Imagine the effort it would take
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we fail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have been refraining and intend to continue to keep refraining.  You?
</em><br>
<p>You'll agree it's quite difficult to do so when subjects like this come up,
<br>
won't you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  discussion of human augmentation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perfection is valueless without moral perfection.  I would say, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only worthwhile augmentation pursuit would be the moral one and that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OUGHT to have longevity-producing and human-improving side effects.
</em><br>
<p>Now in this we're in perfect agreement.  How we'd go about defining morality
<br>
to be perfected, aye, there's the rub.
