<br>
to traverse the terrain between here and there.
<br>
<p>Brett,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are concerned with the capital flight from the US and the 
<br>
resulting job losses in the US the answers seems fairly obvious from this 
<br>
viewpoint.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, The US government is the problem not the solution.  American 
<br>
investors have gotten tired of being subject to OEO, AFL/CIO, OSHA, EPA, IRS and 
<br>
the thousand and one other alphabet laws and regulating or taxing agencies.  
<br>
As far back as the sixties when I first began working in management American 
<br>
companies were attempting to get out from under by excaping highly regulated 
<br>
states to those that would offer some shelter.  Now we have the international 
<br>
flight as a continuation of that early effort.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish to stop American investors from fleeing this country get 
<br>
rid of the encumbrances of doing business here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Recognise that the market will eventually follow the jobs that 
<br>
follow the investment money.  This means there will be opportunities for 
<br>
intreprenuers that can tap into the supply of cheap American labor to supply 
<br>
products to the American market.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, This is really a sub section to &quot;Second.&quot;  I don't know what 
<br>
the efficiency of foreign foreign manufacturing is relative to American 
<br>
manufacturing but it seems like it couldn't be good.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know from consulting to manufacturing as an &quot;efficiency expert&quot; that 
<br>
labor constitutes a small percentage of the total manufacturing dollar.  When 
<br>
you compare that to the cost of shipping products back to the US and 
<br>
marketing them here any direct labor savings have to be slender. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand in today's environment overhead costs can easily be 
<br>
three or four times the labor costs in the total manufacturing cost.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes and regulatory costs are an important part of that overhead.  
<br>
But, that takes us back to my first point.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example.   I did a cost cutting project for Ford 
<br>
Motor Company back in the early 80s.  In the first six plants they assigned me I 
<br>
acted as a leader and found them four million dollars in labor savings.  If 
<br>
we had time to discuss all the surrounding circumstances that was no big deal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand in my retirement I have taken up the study of Tax 
<br>
Accounting.  I am learning that an expert team of tax accountants can often save 
<br>
companies much more money than I ever could.  Of course as soon as soon as 
<br>
the Congress discovers what the companies are doing they yell foul.  At that 
<br>
point hearings are held and in comes the Justice Department to close the &quot;loop 
<br>
hole&quot; by criminal prosecution if possible or by recommending to Congress a new 
<br>
law.  Then Congress gets some favorable press, they pick up a few votes, and 
<br>
overseas goes some more investment money.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those wiley tax accountants and tax attorneys have pointed out once 
<br>
again that it is cheaper overseas where you don't have to contend with the IRS, 
<br>
OEO, EPA, etc as well as the Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
<br>
