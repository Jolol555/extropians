<em>&gt;Don't open-source an AI that can potentially be corrupted and that can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accomplish more damage than uncorrupted AIs can correct.  If you're in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state where a corrupted version of your AI can do serious global damage, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then don't open-source that AI.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;One problem with this is that you probably won't have a good estimate
<br>
of the damage that could be caused by a corrupted version, so this
<br>
reasoning will lead you to keep the source secret even if that slows
<br>
down development enough that someone else produces the first AI, and/or
<br>
hinders the debugging to a degree that you end up relying on an AI that
<br>
isn't as friendly as you think it is.
<br>
&nbsp;Another problem is that if you keep it secret and claim it's powerful
<br>
enough to save the world, it would seem sensible for anyone who believes
<br>
your claims about its power to suspect that you will use it to acquire
<br>
personal power over the rest of us.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If, as I suspect, releasing the source code only enables corrupted versions
<br>
to become powerful after years of learning (i.e. much of the value is in
<br>
a database produced by the AI that takes a lot of cpu time to duplicate),
<br>
then I recommend open-sourcing the AI even though that causes some hard-to-
<br>
evaluate risks of malicious AIs being produced at some uncertain time.
<br>
&nbsp;Remember that keeping it secret can't eliminate the uncertainty - once
<br>
someone shows that AI is possible, there will be lots of people trying to
<br>
write their own AI. It's just a matter of time before they succeed.
