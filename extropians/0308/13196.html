<br>
<p>Alex,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ponder this for awhile.  There has been a Saudi Royal Prince invited 
<br>
to ride our space shuttle and to go into space as an astronaut but you haven't 
<br>
been invited and it matters not how interested in space you are nor does it 
<br>
matter how much research you have done.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also said, &quot;(shut up conservatrolls, economics is a social science 
<br>
too)&quot; I don't know if that was intended for such as me or not.  But, in any 
<br>
case please don't make that kind of comment.  I'll bet I study more economics 
<br>
than most do.  Almost every night I read myself to sleep with economics but 
<br>
occasionally with political science.  
<br>
Ron h.
<br>
<p>BTW, please do not even think of apologizing for that comment above.  You 
<br>
didn't rise to the level of being insulting.  I am not a conservative but an 
<br>
observer of realpolitik. &lt;G&gt;
