<em>&gt; Well, then I guess all joint forms of property are &quot;the antithesis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual ownership&quot;. You have heard of &quot;joint ownership&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>### The more dilute the ownership, the less it has to do with individual
<br>
freedom, so the most dilute form of ownership, the state, is therefore
<br>
farthest away from it. A jointly owned medical practice is still controlled
<br>
by its owners, a state is no longer owned - it owns you.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; disconnecting gains from work and losses from responsibility, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; diminishes you and everybody it touches.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I and my ancestors built this country. That was our work.  Our wages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are higher than in many other countries. Mexico, for example. Now you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see our gain.
</em><br>
<p>### &quot;I and my ancestors&quot;! :-)
<br>
<p>Like &quot;I did it, and they helped out, too.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's not &quot;our&quot; wages, it is John's, Dick's and Harry's wages - in the free
<br>
market, from everyone according to his ability, for everyone according to
<br>
his usefulness. What other citizens pay, for what, to whom, and what they
<br>
get, from whom, and for what, is nobody's business but their own. You don't
<br>
own them.
<br>
<p>Well, whatever work you did, you got paid. Period. None of the purchasers of
<br>
your work took on an obligation to keep you employed, even when hiring you
<br>
is no longer a profitable venture. Nobody owes you a living. No Americans,
<br>
no Mexicans. Whoever your ancestors might have been. Hired work doesn't give
<br>
you ownership rights to the factory you are working in.
<br>
<p>You want to really own a piece of America, buy real estate or stocks. This
<br>
is ownership, earned, deserved. All else is tribal spear-shaking.
<br>
<p>Saying &quot;My daddy worked here, so give me special treatment&quot; would get a job
<br>
applicant laughed out of any well-run business, and hopefully America, Inc.,
<br>
won't listen to such demands either.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In fact, you Rafal personally decided to enjoy a bit of
<br>
<em>&gt; OUR work and enjoy the gains of the country WE built, even though you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the grasshopper to our ant, correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Of course I decided to enjoy the opportunities offered by the US job
<br>
marketplace, because I personally deserve it - my services are useful to my
<br>
employer (and indirectly to you, by limiting the costs of medical care), and
<br>
I offer them in a fair exchange, without trying to pull in any favors, but
<br>
bringing in about 300 000$ in education and other growing-up expenses that
<br>
your ancestors didn't have to pay for. You know, my uncle was in the
<br>
Marines, my aunt worked here for 40 years - so what? What counts is that me,
<br>
Rafal, offers his services as a physician for sale, and will receive the
<br>
price the market will bear, which is what I deserve, for what I build (not
<br>
some nebulous &quot;WE&quot;), no more, no less.
<br>
<p>Nah, I am the ant that pulls his weight.
<br>
<p>Rafal
