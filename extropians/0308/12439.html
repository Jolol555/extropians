[Having had the benefit of your comments I thought
<br>
I take another look at this thread in light of some of
<br>
the claims Warwick makes in his book ]
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my mind Warwick's claim to be the first cyborg 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unjustified. He has done little more than implant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a small transmitter tracking device that has no real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface with or use to the body. The device would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have given exactly the same results if it were in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pocket, rather than under his skin. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, I could be forced to agree that he is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably the first human cyborg for being a cyborg's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake. I believe his next step will be to implant direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural connections and a transmitter. This is a far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater step towards Cyborgism and should yield
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some interesting data. Direct interfacing is the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go. 
</em><br>
<p>Alex, Warwick did a simpler experiment in 1998 where
<br>
all he did do was implant a small transmitter in his arm
<br>
(without connecting it any way to the median nerve) and
<br>
walk about with it, activating appliances in a computerised
<br>
house, almost, as you aptly put it, as though it was in his
<br>
pocket. Yet, in this book written in August 2002, he does
<br>
actually get an electrode array surgically implanted into 
<br>
the medial nerve of his left wrist for three months. I wonder
<br>
if it is possible that you have heard of the earlier work and
<br>
are mixing it up with the later 2002 experiment? Certainly
<br>
Warwick is claiming he achieved direct interfacing (albeit
<br>
in a limited way) with this set of 2002 experiments.
<br>
<p>&quot;A micro electrode array consisting of 100 individual 
<br>
electrodes (only 20 of which were active due to manu-
<br>
facturer delivery time constraints) was implanted in the
<br>
median nerve (lower left arm above the wrist). The radius
<br>
of each electrode tip was 1-3 mm, the active region being
<br>
50-80mm long.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The technique (provided) selective recording and
<br>
stimulation of sensory and/or motor neurons within the 
<br>
nerve fascicles.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The main difference between the 1998 implant and the
<br>
new experiment was the connection that would be made
<br>
with the nervous system, ... using the Utah array. The
<br>
main body of  the implant (was) a radio transmitter/
<br>
receiver (used) to send signals from (his) nervous system
<br>
by radio to the computer and to receive signals sent, 
<br>
again by radio, from the computer and play them on 
<br>
(his) nervous system via the median nerve in his arm.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Amongst the achievements that Warwick would claim
<br>
in the 2002 experiments would be the following:
<br>
<p>In a first set of experiments in April 2002 Warwick 
<br>
showed how signals from his brain could be used to 
<br>
control robots, operate in a limited way an articulated
<br>
robotic hand, and to manipulate the local environment
<br>
(the network in the cybernetics building). 
<br>
<p>In a second set of experiments Warwick controlled the
<br>
robot hand via moving his fingers and sending a neural 
<br>
signal to a computer then across the Atlantic, via the 
<br>
internet. He verified that he could receive a signal back
<br>
to his nervous system (a small shock to his median nerve
<br>
closing his left index finger) over the internet and 
<br>
demonstrated a sort of bat like extra sense. To do this
<br>
he wore an ultrasonic hat with sender and receiver
<br>
antenna both wired from a wearable hat into his median
<br>
nerve via the array such that he could judge the proximity
<br>
of approaching or retreating objects with his eyes closed.
<br>
<p>Warwick argues these are true cyborg powers because
<br>
sensing over the internet and having a sonar sense like
<br>
a crude form of bat sonar is above and beyond the senses
<br>
of normal humans.
<br>
<p>Warwick also managed to drive a wheelchair using the
<br>
signals sent from his median nerve when he opened and
<br>
closed his hand and managed to set up a crude sort
<br>
of Morse code whereby he and his partner (that had a
<br>
single electrode implanted) could send each other simple
<br>
messages (essentially something or nothing - so a kind
<br>
of Morse code).  This for Warwick was *the* very big
<br>
deal as he saw it as the first direct nervous system to
<br>
nervous system communication. Albeit in a simple form.
<br>
<p>[Mez writes]
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Warwick was certainly not the first human to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrodes inserted into his body.  Back in 97, years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before Warwick had an electrode stuck in his arm, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Phil Kennedy was inserting electrodes into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains of patients with ALS and giving them the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to move cursors on computer screens by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought.  More than 20 years ago, Dobelle implanted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his first patient with a cortical visual prosthesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing useful vision.  There are more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 80,000 people with cochlear implants now -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  electrodes stimulating their auditory nerve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>All good points and Warwick would agree with these
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>[Mez continues:]
<br>
<em>&gt; Warwick's experiments, by contrast, are rather tame.
</em><br>
<p>Here I think I must disagree. Whilst Warwicks successes
<br>
are mainly proof in principle they do imo achieve successes
<br>
*as* proofs in principle. That Warwick was able to get his 
<br>
experimental protocols through ethics committees and get
<br>
his finding on the record should make it substantially easier
<br>
for others to do follow up research.  Warwicks research 
<br>
shows that given a sufficiently detailed understanding of the
<br>
nervous system (which we are seriously lacking because its
<br>
so hard to get permission to do the experiments) it would be 
<br>
possible to give amputees &quot;bridges&quot; over damaged nerves 
<br>
and to get direct nervous system control over wheelchairs 
<br>
etc. He also puts on the record that the brain can quickly 
<br>
adopt and accommodate new sensory input without any
<br>
apparent side effects over a three month period.
<br>
<p>By doing what he did scientifically, in the way he did it, as
<br>
a self promoting publicity machine Warwick pushed the
<br>
peanut forward substantially in my view. He deliberately
<br>
courted the media and managed to make his relationship
<br>
with them a symbiotic one. In this I think his story, like the
<br>
story of Michael West in Merchant's of Immortality is 
<br>
a story worth aspiring extropic entrepreneurs taking on
<br>
board.
<br>
<p>[Natasha picks up Alex Blainey's point:]
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IMO even people with artificial limbs or joints rank 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; higher on the cyborg scale than Warwick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree in total.  You make an important point.  The art
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of machine/human interface is being performed by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most apt people around - those who need to upgrade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live or function, rather than fancy footwork and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superficial accessorization at this point. 
</em><br>
<p>To Warwicks credit he does not minimise the seriousness
<br>
of artificial limbs, cochlea implants etc or the utility of 
<br>
wearables. All these things are seen as good. He is however
<br>
interested in improving the functionality and range of such
<br>
artificial limbs and he is not averse, indeed he savours the
<br>
idea of not just replacing what is lost of normal human 
<br>
function but positively adding too human capabilities as 
<br>
a matter of choice.  
<br>
<p>[Charles Hixson raises the point of what is a cyborg
<br>
and cybernetics:]
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps &quot;cyborgness&quot; should be considered a graduated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon rather than a flip-flop.  This would put the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first people to wear furs to stay warm at the most primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of cyborg.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTOH, a person with a pace-maker is definitely more of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a cyborg than a guy with an implanted tracker.  (Cyborg:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cybernetic Organism. Cybernetic from the Greek steersman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ref.: Norbert Weiner.)
</em><br>
<p>From a number of standpoints the precise definition of cyborg
<br>
may be arbitrary. Warwick sees some merit in preserving the
<br>
term not for wearables (though he doesn't diminish their importance)
<br>
but for &quot;something that is part-animal, part-machine and whose
<br>
capabilities are extended *beyond* normal limits. This is much
<br>
more general than other definitions and includes creatures other 
<br>
than humans. It allows for mental upgrades as well as physical
<br>
upgrades and allows the extension to go beyond the normal
<br>
limits of either the animal or the machine.&quot; Warwick distinguishes
<br>
wearables as part of a &quot;cybernetic system&quot;.
<br>
<p>[Samantha writes:]
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, Steve Mann of continuous wearable computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fame, is much more advanced as a practical cyborg imho 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than anyone with medical prothesis of any kind currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the market.  
</em><br>
<p>Steve Mann certainly gets a favourable plug in the book. 
<br>
<p>My interest Samantha was to try and find out what sorts of
<br>
products and what the state of the art (or near state of the
<br>
art) in cyborg or cyborg-like technologies was. On the whole
<br>
I think the book gives a pretty good summary in retrospect.
<br>
<p>I agree that from a practical point of view, at least in the
<br>
short term there is a lot to be said for being able to put on
<br>
and take off  clothing having the sort of extra capabilities
<br>
that one might have as a cyborg. However what intrigued me 
<br>
about the book was the argument that eventually the forms of 
<br>
interpersonal communication people use with each other
<br>
will come to seem hopelessly inadequate in comparison
<br>
with the sort of tech enable telepathy that may become
<br>
available. I was also on the lookout for work that might
<br>
indicate to me how much is actually able to be done in
<br>
terms of cutting into the bodies of volunteers who want
<br>
to experiment in an informed way with memory enhancements
<br>
and uploads in the future. What struck me was that we
<br>
actually know so little not just about the brain but about
<br>
the nervous system generally, and that this is a logical 
<br>
consequence of our aversion to do research on living 
<br>
humans (including volunteers and ourselves).
<br>
<p>[ Samantha again:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Manfred Clynes described the need for humans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificially enhance biological functions in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive in the hostile environment of Space.
</em><br>
<p>This theme of the need to become cyborgs, to join
<br>
with the machines or be displaced by them is an 
<br>
underlying one throughout the book. Warwick like
<br>
Moravec sees humans qua humans eventually becoming
<br>
a subspecies.
<br>
---------
<br>
<p>Thanks for the thoughts folks. In hindsight I reckon the
<br>
book is a reasonably good read but as I said originally
<br>
it is like looking over the shoulder of a researcher and 
<br>
I imagine a ghost writer or several editors had to do a
<br>
lot of work to turn Warwicks notes into a readable
<br>
but not very indexed book.
<br>
