<p>Natasha has made this lexical point repeatedly of late. It reminds me of my
<br>
own irritation when most people use `sci fi' for what I and almost everyone
<br>
inside the science fiction community have always called `sf' or `SF'; or
<br>
when I hear `deconstructionism' instead of `deconstruction'. These
<br>
distinctions strike outsiders as utterly inconsequential, and insisting on
<br>
them as laughable, but I can't help myself. Still--
<br>
<p>In the case of `extropy', I find it hard to see how this recently coined
<br>
noun has any special claim to group-membership status. The usual patterns
<br>
in German (I think) suggest that the equivalent term for extropy theory in
<br>
that language would be `extropismus', akin to `extropism' in English--as
<br>
indeed it does seem to be used in Europe--and I admit that's rather ugly.
<br>
Most people here are extropians, not extropists, although some are
<br>
exhibitionists. But I suppose the point isn't the *word* as such, it's the
<br>
automatic implication of group-think that goes with any -ism. At least
<br>
nobody has yet suggest Extropianity. :)
