I have come across a fascinating website which was new to me and had numerous excellent writings.   
<br>
<p>My mother met one of the key founders, Peter Schwartz, while she attended Columbia University. This was back when dinosaurs walked the earth! lol   
<br>
<p>The following article explains why the U.S. will truly suffer if it neglects stem cell research.  And it reveals some of the myths we have used to rationalize turning away from this key biotechnology.

<p>Taken from the Global Business Network website:
<br>
<p>Global Business Network was created in 1987 around a pool table in a Berkeley, California basement by five friends. These GBN cofounders envisioned a worldwide learning community of organizations and individuals드 network, connected by the open and generous exchange of ideas, &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; scenario thinking, ruthless curiosity, and exciting new information technologies. 
<br>
<p>During the late 1980s, when GBN was founded, signs of significant change든ven discontinuity등ere emerging in the business environment, driven by a convergence of technological, social, political, economic, and environmental forces. GBN's cofounders were convinced that the business community듩ot government등as most likely to translate emerging opportunities into sustainable growth and a better future. The challenge: encouraging companies to question드nd change듮heir mental maps, to embrace uncertainty, and to stop predicting the future based on the past. 
<br>
<p>The Founders 
<br>
<p>Peter Schwartz, futurist and business strategist; author of The Art of the Long View, When Good Companies Do Bad Things, and The Long Boom; former head of scenario planning at Royal Dutch/Shell in London, and director of the Strategic Environment Center at SRI International 
<br>
<p>Jay Ogilvy, author of Living Without a Goal and China's Futures, professor of philosophy at Yale and Williams, and past head of SRI's Values and Lifestyles research 
<br>
<p>Napier Collyns, networker extraordinaire, a 30-year veteran of Royal Dutch/Shell, responsible for planning, public affairs and human resources 
<br>
<p>Stewart Brand, writer, futurist, and inventor of ideas; author of The Clock of the Long Now, How Buildings Learn, The Media Lab, and originator of The Long Now Foundation, the Whole Earth Catalog, CoEvolution Quarterly, and The WELL computer network 
<br>
<p>Lawrence Wilkinson, multi-media innovator; current vice-chair of Oxygen Media and former president of Colossal Pictures 
<br>
<p>Also instrumental in GBN's creation were several key colleagues in Europe: Kees van der Heijden and Arie de Geus, both former heads of Group Planning at Shell, and Bo Ekman, a consultant and former Volvo executive.
