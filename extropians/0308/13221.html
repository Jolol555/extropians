-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Matt Welland
<br>
<p><p>...This thread strikes an interesting cord for me. In my opinion one of
<br>
the 
<br>
unaddressed (and unintended) consequences of unbridled capitalism(*) is
<br>
that 
<br>
over time natural resources, i.e. land, slowly ends up in the hands of a
<br>
few...
<br>
<p><p>On the contrary, this consequence is intended.  This
<br>
demonstrates the beauty and power of unbridled capitalism.
<br>
Matt, when wealth is evenly spread over the population, it
<br>
is just money.  But when it is concentrated in the hands
<br>
of a few, then it becomes CAPITAL and it takes on a certain
<br>
POWER to create new wealth and make things happen.  This is 
<br>
because when money does concentrate, notice that it always 
<br>
seems to fall into the hands of those who know how to USE 
<br>
the capital to create more wealth, to the benefit of everyone, 
<br>
whether by creating jobs or by creating products to be 
<br>
purchased by the proletariat.
<br>
<p>Contrast this to unbridled communism, which destroys the
<br>
value of land, since the government cannot be trusted to
<br>
not seize the land on a whim (so why pay much for it?).
<br>
Communism destroys wealth by reducing incentive to struggle
<br>
and take risks.  Take away the rewards of competition,
<br>
and people will not compete.  If people do not compete,
<br>
they do not achieve excellence.  They eventually get to
<br>
where they achieve practically nothing, living in a dingy
<br>
gray hell, struggling for mediocrity but not getting there.  
<br>
Russia will likely not recover from the curse of communism 
<br>
before the singularity.  
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
...Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by a few
<br>
very 
<br>
rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining population...
<br>
<p><p><p>It would work that way except for the fact that land
<br>
is not a critical resource anymore.  In fact most
<br>
land is actually a liability.  Land in cities has a
<br>
great deal of value, and is increasing.  Intellectual
<br>
property carries value and is increasing.  Farmland?  Nah,
<br>
it's just dirt, and the tax structure of the U.S. is
<br>
making it harder all the time to make money from it.
