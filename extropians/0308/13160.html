<p>
Someone wrote me off list and asked about the death of the Inquiring
<br>
Skeptics of Upper New York. (I spent about four years as vice-president
<br>
of that group and one as president.)
<br>
<p>I thought part of the lessons learned would be worth sharing.
<br>
<p>I've given a lot of thought as to why skeptics groups die off and such
<br>
and might some day put something up on my website about it. What's been
<br>
holding me back is that I don't wish to waste time with a &quot;he said/ she
<br>
said/ and they were wrong and I was right&quot; sort of thing that would just
<br>
be stupid and childish. Much of what happened still makes the people
<br>
involved emotional. (including me.)
<br>
<p>However there are lessons that I think anyone involved with a local
<br>
group should consider.
<br>
<p>Part of the problem(s) I think are:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Unlike many organization (such as boy scout troops, bowling
<br>
leagues, the Elks, etc.) nobody is quite sure what a skeptics group
<br>
should do. For instance, one issue was the desire of some to explore
<br>
haunted houses and do a firewalk while others felt this was totally
<br>
innapropriate to the extent that it should actively be prevented by any
<br>
means necessary.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Since skeptics groups tend to be run by a few people who form the
<br>
group to do what it wants, and since ultimately people tend to get
<br>
burned out doing the same thing, and people who approach the group
<br>
hesitantly and then find out that it doesn't do the sorts of activities
<br>
they would like it to, tends to leave, the result is a small group of
<br>
people who drive the organization along to act along narrow lines and
<br>
then ultimately these people get burned out before they are replaced.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore if the focus of the group's activities is too narrow,
<br>
people tend to get burned out before they can be replaced.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Since skeptics, as a group, pride themselves on their ability to
<br>
think logically, they sometimes tend to be a bit sure of themselves.
<br>
After all, compared to most people, they are more likely to be factually
<br>
correct in their conclusions than many people one meets. On the other
<br>
hand, some skeptics become overconfident in their thinking abilities and
<br>
feel they are &quot;correct&quot; when others disagree with them, when often the
<br>
issues under discussion do not fall within the &quot;correct/ incorrect&quot;
<br>
paradigm. (i.e. &quot;Is it appropriate for a skeptics group newsletter to
<br>
list a planned bowling outing for its members?&quot; This is strictly a
<br>
hypothetical example, but I think many of the people who are willing to
<br>
volunteer time to make a skeptics group work also assume there is a
<br>
correct answer to this question, when of course it is not a yes or no
<br>
question. OTOH, the fact is that ultimately one has to make a yes or no
<br>
decision if such an issue is raised or suggested within a skeptics
<br>
group.) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, many but not all of the sorts of persons who volunteer to
<br>
help run a skeptics group show rigid thought patterns.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) These problems, in my opinion, were not helped by the fact that
<br>
for much of the group's history, we did not hold regular officers
<br>
meetings and instead tried to manage things by using an e-mail list.
<br>
E-mail is good for some things. Face to face communication is required
<br>
for others, especially complex fuzzy issues (i.e. to repeat the above
<br>
hypothetical bowling issue, it could easily turn into a yes/ no --
<br>
right/wrong flamewar by e-mail.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem with not holding officers' meetings is it makes it
<br>
more difficult to recruit people to get involved in helping the group
<br>
run. i.e. if you have officers meetings, it is relatively easy to say to
<br>
someone who appears quite interested in the group, &quot;How would you like
<br>
to come to an officers' meeting? There's no obligation to do anything,
<br>
but you'll get a chance to see how things are run.&quot; Often you can get
<br>
such people to do something small that way and thus set the groundwork
<br>
for many things.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one reason there were not officers meetings is that many
<br>
people assumed from the beginning that all who wished to join a skeptics
<br>
group would agree with their logic and vision, and thus there would be
<br>
little to discuss.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough said. I reserve the right to drop out of any discussions on
<br>
this issue, simply because I don't want to open too many cans of worms
<br>
and so on. Sometimes it's best to let wounded dogs fester (or something
<br>
like that.) and this can be an emotional issue for me.
