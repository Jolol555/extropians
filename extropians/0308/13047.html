----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: &quot;Greg Burch&quot; &gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm very sorry to see Lee leave the list, but I have to count it as a
</em><br>
mistake
<br>
<em>&gt; on Lee's part.  The mistake arises from what the concept of free speech
</em><br>
means
<br>
<em>&gt; in the specific context of this forum.  Everyone probably agrees that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of specific post could justify excluding someone from the list. Hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions arise when we realize we almost certainly wouldn't agree on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precise limits beyond which a single post could justify exclusion.  We
</em><br>
enter
<br>
<em>&gt; the ground of irony when we realize that even some people who disagreed
</em><br>
very
<br>
<em>&gt; strongly with Mike Lorrey don't support his exclusion (vid. Hubert Mania's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post of today.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I too saw a little irony in all this, but not the same irony: This little
<br>
incident doesn't seem to exactly confirm the hopes that technology and
<br>
spontaneous order will solve extant social problems. It is interesting the
<br>
way Greg describes the problem. We have two choices: either no list
<br>
moderation, which leads to an unacceptable degradation of list quality; or
<br>
some form of coercion is used to enforce list rules. This either/or seems to
<br>
go back to the Greeks and his proposed solution of distinguishing between
<br>
government/private suppression of speech is also a familiar idea. Will our
<br>
greater understanding of human nature and greater technological mastery not
<br>
help? What would a technical fix to the problem look like? The most common
<br>
suggestion is that if you don't like someone's posts you should put them in
<br>
your killfile. As it turns out, Mike has been in my kill file for a
<br>
longtime. Not that I find everything he says offensive or unworthwhile, it
<br>
is simply that my assessment of the signal to noise ratio doesn't make it
<br>
worth my time to read his numerous posts. (A little too much Yosemite Sam
<br>
for my taste). Clearly the kill file advice has been around for a while and
<br>
hasn't done much to avoid the present problem. (For the record: I have no
<br>
idea what Mike is alleged to have done to merit the expulsion so I have no
<br>
idea whether this (temporary) expulsion is justified or not). I am sure Mike
<br>
has no idea he is in my killfile--I've never had an acrimonious exchange
<br>
with him for instance. The reason, as I explained, is simply a cost/benefit
<br>
calculation.  I wonder if the problem is that the killfile solution doesn't
<br>
provide sufficient feedback. Imagine a public registry of killfiles:
<br>
somewhere on the Ex site you could register your killfile preferences, so I
<br>
could look up my name and see the names of those who are not &quot;buying&quot; what I
<br>
have to say. It would be even better if the list could be configured to send
<br>
only those emails that are not in my killfiles. The hypothesis of this
<br>
experiment is that people might be a little more careful in what they say,
<br>
because they will have an interest in not increasing their killfile
<br>
quotient; and that there may be fewer merely ad hominem exchanges as people
<br>
can publicly signal their disapproval by changing their killfile
<br>
preferences.  I don't think most of us would see this as curtailing free
<br>
speech, since the right to free speech does not entail that others have a
<br>
duty to listen. In any event, without some sort of feedback mechanism it
<br>
seems pretty clear that there is little hope for some sort of spontaneous
<br>
order, which means that we will be stuck with the either/or that Greg
<br>
describes.
<br>
<p>If I were a critic of transhumanism I would certainly use this as an example
<br>
of how little technology and science seem to improve age-old social
<br>
dilemmas. If my experiment is not tried I hope others will be suggested and
<br>
tried that will attempt to move us at least a little beyond this age-old
<br>
either/or.
