</em><br>
<p>I believe there was a warrant based on information previously obtained
<br>
without a warrant; and the warrant was worded very broadly -- no specific
<br>
crime mentioned. Section 203 (b)(1) authorizes sharing of information
<br>
between various federal employees or agents, including any attorney for the
<br>
U.S.; for example, information included in a federal income tax return could
<br>
be communicated from IRS to the FBI, which could then use this information
<br>
to apply for a warrant; my understanding is that the information on the tax
<br>
return could be something as innocent as an entry on Schedule B, Form 1040,
<br>
of interest received from a foreign bank account.  Section 213 of the PA
<br>
authorizes what amounts to indefinite delay of notice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Did the CPA take the warrant to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer he consulted?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Did you see it?
<br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Liberty isn't self-executing and never will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be.  If he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt it wasn't justified, how active was the CPA in challenging the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigation?
</em><br>
<p>This is one reason I find the PA so troubling: see, it wasn't the CPA's
<br>
problem, beyond the need to cover his ass if the client later complained.
<br>
And the client was not given the opportunity to challenge the investigation,
<br>
because the CPA was not allowed to inform him (prohibition of communication
<br>
from CPA to client is authorized by Section 213 of the PA).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Police forces are *always* going to bump up against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boundaries of their legal authority, even when they have only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good motives.
</em><br>
<p>Right. But if the police can act in secret, they can clean out the barn
<br>
before the farmer is even aware the door's been opened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My second point is to ask whether the specific items you mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your post are from the current law or the so-called &quot;Patriot Act II.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>They're in the Patriot Act that was signed into law in October, 2001.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And I don't see any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indication that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courts won't enforce the Constitution when push comes to shove --
</em><br>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, this is not the first time such problems
<br>
have arisen with laws passed in haste to address a crisis. There is no
<br>
reason to get hysterical. But I do think people need to be aware that
<br>
certain rights we tend to take for granted are being threatened.
