<p>Ok, this sounds like a very *interesting* challenge.
<br>
<p>Taking the standard diet that the FDA proposes:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pyramid.html">http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/Fpyr/pyramid.html</a>
<br>
just *how* inexpensive can one make a healthy diet?
<br>
<p>It is not completely necessary to consume all of the required vitamins and
<br>
minerals from dietary sources -- one can use supplements.  It would be an
<br>
extropic project to produce a set of weekly menus with some variety that
<br>
have the lowest cost and best &quot;health&quot; perspectives.  We could start with
<br>
&quot;daily&quot; menus and mix and match contributions from individuals.  One would
<br>
have to do some math based on the nutrition content of various meals and
<br>
prices from grocery receipts but it should not be *that* difficult
<br>
given information one is now normally provided with.
<br>
<p>My sample calculation: 2500 calories/day / 280 calories/meal = ~9 meals/day.
<br>
(based on calorie content of Lean Cuisine &quot;Sweedish Meatballs&quot; dish).
<br>
Nine meals per day @ $3.35/meal = ~$904/month.  And that is based on
<br>
&quot;pre-prepared&quot; meals.  (There are some huge problems with salt
<br>
content of 9 such meals per day but it provides a frame of reference.)
<br>
<p>Interestingly, if we had an &quot;ideal&quot; menu we might discover which
<br>
countries really are regulating agricultural imports in such a way
<br>
as to drive up prices and support their farm &quot;lobby&quot; at the expense
<br>
of the consumers.
<br>
