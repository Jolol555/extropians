On Sun, 3 Aug 2003, Lee Corbin (commenting on my comments) wrote:
<br>
<p>Re: copying vs. moving information...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Listen, as hard as it will be---I admit---to broadcast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, that pales in comparison to the difficulty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of moving it. You aren't making any sense, are you?
</em><br>
<p>I just don't know.  Robert Freitas has made documented
<br>
arguments on the advantages to sending probes rather
<br>
than radio signals.  [And when Robert F. talks I tend
<br>
to try and listen closely.]  I've thought about the
<br>
&quot;broadcast&quot; perspective -- you have to setup a very
<br>
large &quot;grid&quot; of parallel high power laser transmitters
<br>
then on the receiving side you need an even larger grid
<br>
of receiving telescopes.  And that is even to get some
<br>
small fraction of the information content of a system.
<br>
<p>So whether one sends information densely packed into
<br>
a &quot;probe&quot; or whether one sends information via radio
<br>
(really silly), light, or UV I don't know -- I just
<br>
strongly suspect the amount that can be sent is very
<br>
very small relative to the amount available.
<br>
<p>So my assertion would be that advanced stellar civilizations
<br>
are in effect &quot;isolated&quot;.  Its kind of like being at a
<br>
party -- you can see virtually everyone as you gaze around
<br>
the room but you can't speak with any of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, so (as we agree in the subsequent part of your email),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually the &quot;stay at homes&quot; could fall behind technologically.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you seem to be assuming that there are no technological
<br>
limits.  I've read a fair amount of literature on the physics of
<br>
computation, nanotechnology, etc. and there *are* limits.  (The
<br>
paper that Anders published in JET several years ago documents
<br>
a number of these.)
<br>
<p>It currently looks to me like any reasonably advanced technological
<br>
civilization hits the limits so quickly (hundreds to thousands of
<br>
years) that anything after that doesn't really matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Their story is old hat.  Why does anything need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrificed: what stays here stays here, and I transmit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much as possible (copying, *not* moving) of myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the least amount of matter than we have to send to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitute a receiver.
</em><br>
<p>But *why* would you create Lee II when Lee II cannot significantly
<br>
benefit Lee I and Lee II (and Lee II's offspring) could potentially
<br>
be competing against you for resources when they start getting scarce
<br>
in the universe?
<br>
<p>You have to create an &quot;enslaved&quot; Lee II that is permanently
<br>
loyal to Lee I which means that its usefullness is limited
<br>
because you have to limit its freedom to evolve.
<br>
<p>Would Great Britian or Spain have allowed the colonization of
<br>
the U.S. if they could have anticipated the creation of a nation
<br>
that would defeat them in various wars?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you have not explained why creatures more advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than we are could not be living right here.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... I thought I had.  The local environment is inhospitable
<br>
to the creation of optimal computing structures (at least of
<br>
one type that I have envisioned).  You simply *cannot* do
<br>
it &quot;here&quot; without disassembling the galaxy.  Even if that
<br>
were feasible, in the universe, as it is currently structured,
<br>
it is much cheaper to simply leave a galaxy.
<br>
<p>But I will grant completely that &quot;aliens&quot; in the form of a
<br>
distributed nanoscale intelligence could be living all around
<br>
us.  I would also likely grant other types of intelligences
<br>
living within our solar system unnoticed by us (e.g. Clarke's
<br>
obelisk, etc.).  But the only reasons I can come up with
<br>
for such efforts would be (a) entertainment value or (b)
<br>
regulation value (should we at some point present a threat
<br>
to the galactic club).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Still, *here*, there is plenty of energy going to waste!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some parts of them would be here, and using that energy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if it was not up to the speeds achievable outside the galaxy.
</em><br>
<p>Energy, at this stage of the development of the Universe, is
<br>
*not* in short supply.  One can star-lift normal stars, harvest
<br>
brown dwarfs for hydrogen, graze on molecular clouds, etc.
<br>
<p>What may be of more interest from a longer term perspective are
<br>
safety and security.  You are still thinking from a &quot;natural&quot;
<br>
evolution point of view -- i.e. &quot;I have to replicate (copy)
<br>
myself&quot;.  You have not made the transition to the &quot;directed&quot;
<br>
evolution point of view -- i.e. &quot;What is best for my long term
<br>
self-preservation and/or development?&quot;  I believe that all
<br>
advanced civilizations will make that transition.
<br>
