General comments:
<br>
<p>For me being an extropian is simple:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;More information (or complexity) is better than less&quot;.
<br>
<p>This is because in part of my process of becoming &quot;enlightened&quot;
<br>
20 or more years ago, I was taught that there are only 3 things
<br>
one can do:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;More, different or better&quot;.
<br>
<p>So the extropic process (acting to defeat entropy) acts in each
<br>
of those 3 directions.
<br>
<p>Why is this useful?  Because each of us has a greater or lesser
<br>
desire for self-preservation -- it has to be a built in &quot;axiom&quot;
<br>
for any species existing today.  (If you can't survive, you can't
<br>
reproduce and the evolutionary process fails.)  Ultimately according
<br>
to current science we are facing a dead end.  All of the stars
<br>
burn out, perhaps the protons decay, the universe may be spread
<br>
apart by the dark energy, etc.  E.g. entropic processes.  The
<br>
only thing that gets us out of the dead-end path is complexity,
<br>
particularly intelligence.  That may allow us to implement
<br>
Dyson's &quot;Time Without End&quot; scenario, or prevent the proton decay
<br>
or tunnel into some alternate part of the multiverse or even
<br>
create a universe with different laws of physics that we
<br>
transport ourselves into.
<br>
<p>Being extropic is a fundamental duty to oneself from the simple
<br>
perspective of self-preservation.  I consider the Extropian
<br>
Principles to be a reasonable set of guidelines as to how we
<br>
might get there.
<br>
<p>Now, one can choose &quot;more&quot;, because it increases our rate
<br>
of information production (e.g. more scientists).
<br>
One can choose &quot;different&quot; paths, perhaps exploring the
<br>
phase space of alternate art forms, because one may not
<br>
believe we can &quot;beat the clock&quot; or it simply makes living life
<br>
more interesting or fun (this gets into Eliezer's &quot;Fun Theory&quot;).
<br>
If one doesn't have fun then one may not get either &quot;more&quot;
<br>
or &quot;better&quot; (because people see no point to life).  Finally one
<br>
can choose &quot;better&quot; because we need to get a better handle
<br>
on theories of physics, how to engineer things, how to predict
<br>
the future, etc. if we are going to ever &quot;beat the clock&quot;.
<br>
<p>I think Rafal's recent statement about drones is about the question
<br>
of whether there people are supporting &quot;more, different, or better&quot;.
<br>
If they are not, then they are probably a drag on the path to the
<br>
singularity and indirectly a threat to &quot;beating the clock&quot;.  That
<br>
in turn is a threat to my personal survival.  The connections are
<br>
tenuous -- but they *are* there.  My statement, which some objected
<br>
to, was an attempt to explore &quot;possible paths to the future&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, depending on what day one talks to me I may question whether
<br>
*any* human being has a fundamental right to exist.  If that
<br>
existance threatens any of the &quot;universe survival&quot; scenarios
<br>
that I have outlined above then I would want to see a cost benefit
<br>
analysis.  If the universe doesn't survive and we don't find a
<br>
way out of it, then I'm a dead person.  *So*, individuals *not*
<br>
contributing to an extropic set of vectors (whether or not they
<br>
view themselves as an extropian) I would probably view as
<br>
threats to my survival.  My impression of some of the comments
<br>
that have been made is that genocide is an &quot;undesirable&quot; solution.
<br>
But that doesn't make it unconsiderable if the universe (or my
<br>
life) is at stake.  To argue otherwise is to invoke the moral
<br>
dilemma that an individual is obligated to sacrifice themselves
<br>
for others (and *yes* I'm aware of the time scale problems).
<br>
The primary problem is that it seems unlikely that genocide can
<br>
be used as a tool to predict the best possible paths to a
<br>
future that enables our collective survival [1].
<br>
<p>Individuals who do not envision (or are not fond of) things like
<br>
lifespan extension, uploading, MBrains, making copies of oneself, etc.
<br>
as &quot;reasonable&quot; possibilities may disagree with my perspective.
<br>

<br>
