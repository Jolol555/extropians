<p>Maxwell's paper &quot;On physical lines of force&quot; 1861-62, was mostly later
<br>
discarded by him, but this was where he originally made the claim.

describes his discovery. The section I think you want is:

<p>Quote:
<br>
&nbsp;The Speed of an Electromagnetic Wave
<br>
In 1861 the British Association for the Advancement of Science set up a
<br>
committee under William Thomson's chairmanship to establish a set of
<br>
electrical and magnetic standards. During the course of their work it
<br>
became clear to Maxwell and others that important insight can be
<br>
obtained by comparing results expressed in the two sets of units,
<br>
electrostatic and electromagnetic, that were being used at the time. The
<br>
electrostatic units were particularly appropriate to static electricity,
<br>
and related the force of attraction and repulsion between two charged
<br>
bodies to the quantities of electricity that they held. The
<br>
electromagnetic system of units, on the other hand, related force to
<br>
electric currents. The quantity of electricity residing on a wire at a
<br>
given time depends on the speed with which the current travels along the
<br>
wire. It can be shown that the ratio of an electromagnetic unit of
<br>
charge to an electrostatic unit of charge is the speed with which the
<br>
current passes along a wire.
<br>
<p>During the 1860s Maxwell and various colleagues carried out careful
<br>
experiments in which they compared the two units. Maxwell's own
<br>
experiments were carried out using equipment made available to him by
<br>
John Peter Gassiot (1797-1877), a wealthy wine merchant and amateur
<br>
scientist who had already done some remarkable experiments using vast
<br>
numbers of electric cells. The conclusion from the experiments comparing
<br>
the two sets of units was that the speed of an electric current was
<br>
close to 3 x 10 m/s, which is the speed of light.
<br>
<p>An alternative approach, used by Maxwell and others, was to compare the
<br>
electrical quantity now called the permittivity of a vacuum, o, with the
<br>
magnetic quantity now called the permeability, µo. Maxwell's
<br>
mathematical treatment of Faraday's lines of force led to the conclusion
<br>
that the speed v of an advancing electromagnetic field was given by
<br>
<p>v =1/(o µo)
<br>
<p>Measurements made by various physicists of µo and o also led to the
<br>
result that v obtained in this way was the speed of light. These results
<br>
convinced Maxwell and others that light is an electromagnetic wave; in
<br>
his own words, emphasized in italics in his 1861-62 papers:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium
<br>
which is the cause of electric and magnetic oscillations.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, a single electromagnetic theory is needed for light, an
<br>
electric field and a magnetic field. The field produced by an electric
<br>
current has also a magnetic component, and the field produced by a
<br>
magnet has also an electric component; light also has electric and
<br>
magnetic components.
<br>

<br>
<p>It should at least give you lots of words to google on!
