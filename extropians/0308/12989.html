</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'd have to care to read it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically - remove restrictions on currency and travel for individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FIRST.  This would be by lifting immigration laws, removing currency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions, privatizing basic social services, eliminating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities for oligarchy generally.   Then, hold members of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations personally responsible for the actions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations.  There are too many specifics to list quickly.  Maybe I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should draft some legislation.
</em><br>
<p>### OK, now I can understand more, and I agree with parts of the list,
<br>
although there is still not enough detail in some items.

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3)  Rafal's question is a valid one, &quot;Should he be prevented from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; making an arbitrary exchange with consenting persons?&quot;  The answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; is yes - if you are exchanging human lives (perhaps any of the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; which results from human lives), you should be prevented from making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; ARBITRARY exchanges of that kind.  You should be prevented by those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; morally responsible for that person's being - themselves, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; friends and family, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### You seem to be using a taboo to reject a class of tradeoffs. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; might want to read Tetlock's article we discussed in the &quot;Taboos&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thread recently. In effect you are arrogating to yourself the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to judge others, and to bend their will to your ideas of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; good for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Not nice, IMO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I said was:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;In any case, it should be the other way around - the political forces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which exist to enable you to make such exchanges should be removed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In today's world this means removing border and economic restrictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on individuals and political organizations FIRST while enforcing those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules on corporations.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Read better and snip better.  The ANTI-Competetive forces that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow you to trade in human effort need to be removed, enabling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human &quot;being traded&quot; to bargain fairly for the value of their labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These include the Limited Liability Corporation (in its various forms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the standard American C-Corp and S-Corp) as well as various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal restrictions on personal behavior (for instance the freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel and the freedom of exchange - including the freedom to use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate currencies such as Gold).
</em><br>
<p>### While I agree with the specifics you provided this time, I have to
<br>
protest that my initial objection (that you are using a taboo-tradeoff
<br>
rejection) was well-justified from reading of your initial statement. You
<br>
did say that individuals should be prevented from bargaining their lives for
<br>
money and other considerations, by some persons &quot;morally responsible&quot; for
<br>
these individuals. I very strongly reject such limitation of freedom.
<br>
<p>----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fine, it's BAD to use INHUMANELY CHEAP LABOR.  Are we now in agreement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or is there something more to your position along the lines of &quot;It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; okay WHATEVER NIKE might be doing&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>### No, I don't think it is bad to use inhumanely cheap labor. As long as
<br>
there is no breach of contract, fraud, neglect of parental duties, monopoly
<br>
ownership of resources, and no use of non-consensual violence, an action is
<br>
not immoral, according to my consequentialist ethical system. Since the
<br>
outcomes of actions which do not exhibit the features I mentioned are almost
<br>
guaranteed to improve the average well-being of humans, I consider such
<br>
actions to be good or neutral until proven otherwise.
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what sense is &quot;Slavery&quot; not MORALLY equivalent with FORCING people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work for $.01/day?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say they were the same thing, just that they were morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent.  &quot;Salva veritae&quot; in moral distinctions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If someone should be punished for enslaving someone else, they should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be punished for forcing them to work in self-perpetuating sub-poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions.
</em><br>
<p>### Well, it is exactly the point - Nike is not forcing anybody to work for
<br>
them, they come begging for work.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Also, I would like to point out to you that, as is obvious to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anybody who read my posts, I do not consider the condition of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to labor for 1 cent a day to be, as you wrote &quot;GOOD&quot;. I stated (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you jeeringly commented on it) &quot;Poverty is wrong&quot;. Please do not try
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to demonize me be ascribing to me a hatred and contempt for humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My mistake, so you're in agreement that any humane (and Extropic)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political program should include as a primary goal the lifting of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political conditions that contribute to chronic poverty and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oligarchies, disenfranchisement, state oppression and unfair business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practices are among the main causes thereof?
</em><br>
<p>### Oh, yes, by all means! You might note that I joined the thread in part
<br>
to point out that protectionism, in addition to harming Americans, harms
<br>
foreigners as well, and this is, as I wrote before &quot;rubbing me the wrong
<br>
way&quot;.
<br>
<p>This said, the term &quot;unfair business practices&quot; has been used in very vague
<br>
ways, so I would need more details before agreeing on it. For me, the only
<br>
unfair (=wrong, bad, unjust, immoral) business practices are the ones
<br>
involving breach of contract, fraud, neglect of parental duties, monopoly
<br>
ownership of resources, and use of non-consensual violence (the same list I
<br>
wrote in a paragraph above). By this definition, protectionism is an unfair
<br>
business practice, contracting for child labor is not.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The adequate words to describe the plight of those who are paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; little by global companies for their labor in e.g. Burma, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;poverty&quot;, &quot;disenfranchisement&quot;, &quot;state oppression&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;oligarchy&quot;. More global investment is the best cure for these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ailments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure what you mean by &quot;Global Investment&quot; but I'd suggest an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative for global investment as it is actually practiced today is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political elimination of the anti-competitive nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oligarchies SUCH AS the policies of the United States, China, Burma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and just about every-other state.  Otherwise your global investment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is likely just to end up in the hands of the wealthy - as it always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has.
</em><br>
<p>### If you are talking about protecting the free market from state
<br>
interference, I am all for it.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The a priori argument is simple - if Nike is allowed to continue its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current &quot;Global Investment&quot; strategy, it will use its economic power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to perpetuate its power and in particular will invest in situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will tend to keep labor cheap and profits high.  This will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include sponsoring &quot;sub-humane&quot; labor conditions in third-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations.  If they can find some military fiend to assist them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Burma, so much the better.  Similarly, the banks that own Nike will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue lending practices which empower those nation-states which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce sub-humane labor to continue that practice as long as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible and will seek to create new slave-states wherever possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and profitable.
</em><br>
<p>### No, poverty does not exist because of Nike, but despite Nike.
<br>
Businessmen invest where labor is cheap, thus causing labor to get more
<br>
expensive. Businessmen do not keep people poor. Politicians do. Businessmen
<br>
can only become a force of evil if they buy the services of politicians and
<br>
armies, which is actually a rare occurrence. In most cases, political
<br>
systems *feed* on business, not the other way around.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, if we were to call the owners of Nike to account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PERSONALLY for the actions of the corporation, for instance, by making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it illegal to be an owner of a company that utilizes child-labor or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced labor or sub-poverty labor, then we'd have something worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about.
</em><br>
<p>### Owners of Nike (I might be one too, I haven't looked at the list of
<br>
stocks in my mutual funds for a long time) should not held responsible for
<br>
their actions, beyond the value of the stock they bought, in accordance with
<br>
the law. It should not be illegal to utilize child-labor, or sub-poverty
<br>
labor (whatever this might mean), since it is not immoral for children and
<br>
poor people to contract for sale of their labor. Only the use of forced
<br>
labor is wrong, since it involves non-consensual violence.
<br>
<p>Liability of joint stock corporations for harms inflicted can easily be
<br>
handled by a compulsory, free-market liability insurance.
<br>
<p>The correct way of helping poor children is to offer education support
<br>
(perhaps in the form of a loan) and protection from abusive parents, rather
<br>
than prosecuting persons who offer gainful employment to them.
<br>
<p>The correct way of helping poor people in general is to offer attractive
<br>
employment to them (or removing the political obstacles to it, as I
<br>
definitely agree with you), perhaps more attractive than wages at Nike - and
<br>
not trying to shut down Nike by political fiat.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, prosecuting &quot;villains&quot; is a more exciting path than actually
<br>
helping others to a better life by a consensual exchange of considerations,
<br>
so the former strategy achieves undue prominence.
