</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might change their behavior in response to the signals they get about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value of their posts. Think of it as somewhat like a market. We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; producers of messages and we want as many people to &quot;buy&quot; our messages as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible. If I send out messages that have a high perceived noise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ratio many people will put me in their killfile, so I will have fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;buyers&quot;. I agree about the perennial dangers of centralized authority,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; while what I am suggesting is not immune from distortion, I also think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangers of corruption are fairly minimal. The public display of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killfiles might look like a table with everyone's name on this list (there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is what about a 1000 people on this list?) on the X and Y axis. I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up your name and see if I am in your killfile and you can look up my name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and see if I am in your killfile. One conjecture then is that if people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; signal their dislike of someone's posts by using the killfile this may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reduce the acrimonious exchanges that sometimes go on. If we are having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an exchange I might put you in my killfile and you might retaliate by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; putting me in your killfile--and so would end the exchange. Next to each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person's name would be the number of people that have entered him or her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into their killfiles. The conjecture is that people might change their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behavior so as not to be entered into too many killfiles. Take an extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example. Suppose an individual posts tons of Nazi propaganda to the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every day. I conjecture that almost all will enter this person into their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killfiles, hence the Nazi's voice will go unheard. This Nazi cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about a centralized authority squashing her voice since the killfiles are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; set by individuals. As I said, the right to free speech does not entail an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obligation on others to listen. The reason this system would be relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impervious to corruption is that each person's killfile would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; displayed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If there was an attempt to discredit someone by artificially raising their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killfile quotient this could be easily detected because each killfile is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assignable to a specific individual. If the list managers tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; artificially raise your killfile quotient they would have to assign it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some individuals, say one of them is me. When I look and see that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preferences have been tampered with I will scream bloody blue murder on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; off the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In your message you use the word killfile fifteen times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it has to to with a language barrier, but when I read the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killfile 15 times in a 35 line message I get the impression there is a war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going on in the heads of the posters. All this scoring and voting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points, making impressions, being competitive, getting adapted to the rat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race of a mental market place.. Scoring, statistics  . . . well I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don`t like it. The use of this very word &quot;killfile&quot; suggests a hostile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atmosphere, at least a competitive one with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise-to-signal-ratio-correctness, always this obsession to be efficient.
</em><br>
<p>My preference is unmoderated lists; however, the proposed moderated list
<br>
for discussion and another for chit chat is a workable approach.  On our
<br>
TLC (Thailand-Laos-Cambodia) lists one is for mission and the other for
<br>
chit chat.  It appeals to those with varying employment restrictions and
<br>
interests.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I never implemented a killfile in my whole Internet career. I want to *know*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what my opponents think. That's why I read their messages with a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care and interest. Sometimes I learn from them more than from persons I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always agree with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I too prefer not to killfile anyone, even the most (IMO) arrogant, bombastic,
<br>
and ignorant poster.  I dislike stereotyping.  Here is a quote from my
<br>
Humanistic Psychology textbook: &quot; [...] one may have a mystical experience -
<br>
een one which may change one's life.  This is not controllable: and if there
<br>
is one thing which academics are about it is control.  It doesn't matter
<br>
whether they are old nasty positivists of new shiny constructionists, they
<br>
are all about control.  Nietzsche would have laughed.&quot;

<p>&quot;We have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we 
<br>
speak.&quot;
