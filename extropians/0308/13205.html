<p>I responded with a reference to John Jeavons's book but forgot to mention my
<br>
own experience. I've found that in central Texas, a person can grow most of
<br>
the food needed by two people on 1/2 acre. This includes raising chickens
<br>
and rabbits (I've heard that guinea pigs and iguanas are also efficient meat
<br>
animals). I had to supplement what I grew with purchased grain and
<br>
occasionally some purchased beef and fish in order to get enough calories
<br>
and protein, and I've never personally seen anyone grow 100% of their food
<br>
on 1/2 acre, but I've heard people (including Jeavons) claim that it can be
<br>
done (in fact, I believe Jeavons claims it can be done on something like
<br>
1000 square feet per person). I initially had a pond stocked with perch,
<br>
bass and catfish, but we had a severe drought. The level of the pond got so
<br>
low that the great blue heron who dropped by every day for breakfast could
<br>
wade across the whole thing. If I'd had a well stocked pond or tank, I think
<br>
we probably could have gotten along without purchasing additional food.
<br>
Ponds are incredibly efficient food producers, since the entire volume is
<br>
productive, not just the surface area. However, by layering crops, you can
<br>
achieve something of the same effect on land (e.g. growing lettuce and other
<br>
somewhat shade tolerant vegetable crops under fruit trees and by training
<br>
vining plants such as squash and melon on trellises or fences).
<br>
<p>Seed crops, although they have a high calorie content per pound of grain,
<br>
are not square foot efficient (although some grain crops, such as hemp,
<br>
might be square foot efficient when you consider the fiber value as well as
<br>
the value of the seed [the medicinal or recreational value of hemp leaves is
<br>
artificially high and would be negligible in the absence of drug laws]). One
<br>
of the most square foot efficient calorie crops here is the sweet potato
<br>
(especially if the vines are trained up a trellis or fence). Irish potatoes
<br>
aren't bad either, although we have a limited growing season -- gets too hot
<br>
from May on, and you can't set them out in the spring until February,
<br>
because they're frost sensitive. Mesquite beans are also efficient if you
<br>
consider that the roots of the mesquite tree fix atmospheric nitrogen in the
<br>
soil, and the leaves produce a very light shade, so you can grow other crops
<br>
directly underneath. Of course agribusiness farmers consider mesquite trees
<br>
to be the work of the devil, because they're almost impossible to kill, and
<br>
they interfere with the heavy equipment.
