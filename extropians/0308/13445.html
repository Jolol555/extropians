</em><br>
<p>I can't answer the question exactly as asked, because I don't know what is
<br>
meant by &quot;wholesale denial of fundamental rights.&quot; But I can tell you the
<br>
aspects of the PA's that disturb me. I'll start with a specific incident
<br>
that occurred around three months ago. A certain CPA was informed by the FBI
<br>
that he must turn over all the papers he held relating to one of his
<br>
clients, and that he would be in violation of the law if he informed his
<br>
client that the papers had been taken. The CPA, shocked at being told he
<br>
could not inform his client what had happened, called his own lawyer. The
<br>
lawyer himself had never heard of any such law. I had read the PA and told
<br>
the lawyer that, yes, amazingly enough, under this law the FBI could seize a
<br>
person's papers without ever informing the owner of the papers and could
<br>
even prevent the custodian of the papers from telling the owner. The owner
<br>
of the papers bore no resemblance to a terrorist.
<br>
<p>In fact, Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra was quoted in the
<br>
Washington Post as saying &quot;We would use whatever tools are available to us
<br>
to prosecute violations of any law,&quot; in the context of discussing the PA,
<br>
and the wording of the PA is such that it could be used against just about
<br>
anyone.
<br>
<p>The 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says: &quot;The right of the people to
<br>
be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
<br>
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants
<br>
shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
<br>
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things
<br>
to be seized.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you look at British common law from the 1600's on, and at U.S. case law
<br>
since the 4th Amendment, it's clear that secret &quot;fishing expeditions&quot; of the
<br>
sort that are being conducted under the PA are exactly the sort of
<br>
government behavior the 4th Amendment was meant to protect people from.
<br>
<p>Here are some of the other provisions of the PA's that could be used to bad
<br>
ends:
<br>
<p>--People can be detained in prison without charged with a crime and without
<br>
being allowed access to a lawyer and obviously, with no trial.
<br>
<p>-- Bank accounts can be frozen without a court order.
<br>
<p>--Information can be obtained about subscribers from ISP's, libraries, and
<br>
stores.
<br>
<p>--Phone conversations can be monitored without a court order.
<br>
<p>These broad powers invite fishing expeditions and invasion of privacy. I'm
<br>
rather sensitive about this, since my own property was invaded by the
<br>
police, without a warrant, under the direction of the BATF -- because BATF
<br>
agents flying over my land in a helicopter saw a Vitex tree growing on my
<br>
land and mistook it for marijuana. A very nervous young man held me at
<br>
gunpoint and could easily have made a mistake and blown me or my daughter
<br>
away. We did not even remotely fit the profile of &quot;drug dealer&quot; or &quot;grower&quot;
<br>
or any other sort of criminal.
<br>
<p>As Lord Acton wrote in 1887, 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power
<br>
corrupts absolutely.' When there are laws on the books that give tremendous
<br>
power to one group of people over another, the power will surely be abused
<br>
in at least some cases.
<br>
<p>Whether such abuses of power will be helpful enough in preventing terrorist
<br>
attacks to be worth the price is another question. I think not, particularly
<br>
when I see how laws that existed before the PA's were not and are not used
<br>
effectively. Based on the history I've read, I would predict that the
<br>
ordinary person will still be in about the same amount of danger of
<br>
terrorist attacks as he or she was before the PA's but will now be in danger
<br>
of acts by overzealous police as well.
