<p>
The comments below prompt me to ask some more of my irritating questions,
<br>
apologies in advance.
<br>
<p>It is becoming increasingly unclear to me that what it is to be an extropian
<br>
is the same for every extropian. In fact, I think we may hold disjoint sets
<br>
of values, and disjoint definitions, in many cases. ie: We may be using the
<br>
same word, but in fact have no common ground. I am brought to this by a long
<br>
history of reading the list, and in particular by the comment below from
<br>
Rafal, and by Robert's assertion that maximising complexity is his guiding
<br>
principle in being an extropian.
<br>
<p>So my questions is this:
<br>
1 - What do you consider to be extropian, or what do you believe it is to be
<br>
an extropian?
<br>
2 - Do you consider yourself to be an extropian?
<br>
3 - If not, why not? Do you hold values which you believe are in conflict
<br>
with Extropy? Or is it purely for &quot;I'm a tough non-joiner kinda dude(tte)&quot;
<br>
reasons? Or perhaps for PR reasons?
<br>
<p>My (personal) answer to the questions above:
<br>
1 - I consider the extropian principles to embody what it is to be an
<br>
extropian. I believe that they don't have a set of more basic principles
<br>
underlying them; they stand as axiomatic. So, I don't feel that a value such
<br>
as &quot;maximise complexity&quot; fits as an extropian underpinning. (Actually, I see
<br>
&quot;maximise complexity&quot; as being a misconflation of the idea of &quot;extropy is
<br>
the opposite of the physics concept of entropy&quot; with what I see as the real
<br>
definition of extropy, which is the use of the extropian principles, and
<br>
only appeals to the physics concept for colour &amp; movement).
<br>
<p>2 - Pretty close to it, but I'm still having trouble comitting, even after
<br>
all these years. I guess I'm just a tough, non-joiner kinda dude. Also, the
<br>
label &quot;Extropian&quot; makes people immediately think it's some kind of
<br>
californian cult (which are after all quite famous around the world), and
<br>
when you say &quot;Well, it is from California, but it's not a cult, really&quot;,
<br>
people begin nodding slowly backing away, making no sudden movements, you
<br>
know the drill.
<br>
<p>I am very close to it, though. What I have found is that, largely informed
<br>
by some years of participation on this list (omg), I find I am, if anything,
<br>
a strong individualist; I believe in the supremacy of the individual over
<br>
that of the group, holding that latter only exists to support the former. I
<br>
don't think I'm a libertarian, however. I support many &quot;groupthink&quot; agenda
<br>
items, such as publicly funded medicine, education, and welfare, as support
<br>
for the individual. 
<br>
<p>My personal view is that the extropian principles are all informed by, and
<br>
can be derived from, strong Invidualism, which is why I like them. Actually,
<br>
perpetual progress is a sticking point... I'm not sure on that one. I like
<br>
it (!!), but I'm not sure why. I think I'm a techno utopian at heart; I
<br>
believe technology is what it is to be human, and that its progression
<br>
enriches us (as individuals, in aggregate).
<br>
<p>3 - Urm, see my answer to 2.
