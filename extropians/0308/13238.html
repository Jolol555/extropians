<p>Huh?  Microsoft owns a few acres over in Redmond and perhaps a few
<br>
other places -- can hardly be considered a &quot;feudal&quot; landlord.  It
<br>
probably has a large amount of cash (go look at its SEC statements)
<br>
invested in some combination of treasury bills (allowing the U.S.
<br>
to run a somewhat lesser budget deficit) and mutual funds (allowing
<br>
the U.S. to provide decreased capital costs to other companies) and
<br>
perhaps in VC funds (allowing the promotion of a greater rate of
<br>
innovation).
<br>
<p>The Microsoft Empire was built in less than 25 years.  It started,
<br>
relatively speaking, from zero property and zero means of production --
<br>
it also does relatively little for the &quot;military&quot; compared with say
<br>
Boeing or Lockheed.  The same could largely be said for Oracle.  If
<br>
you want to take the discussion out of the software realm, one might
<br>
look at 3M or even GE.
<br>
<p>The idea that the &quot;rent-collectors&quot; drive things now-a-days is absurd.
