<em>&gt; Wonder how much of this reduction in the crime rate is attributable to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large increase in legal private gun ownership in the U.S., particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally carried guns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>One researcher (can't recall the name right now) attributes, at least in
<br>
part, the lower crime rates to legalized abortion. Having children you want
<br>
to have might imply better adjusted adults later on.
<br>
<p>Makes sense to me.
<br>

<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>The question to ask is how many 18 to 25 year old people are 
<br>
unemployed.  The crime rate is directly related to the size of this 
<br>
population.  When young men are employed crime goes down.  When young men 
<br>
have no jobs crime goes up.  When the 18 to 25 year old population drops 
<br>
because of how much sex people had a few years back crime goes down.  These 
<br>
drops and rises are really not a mystery.

<br>
<p>Probably little or none at all. It's one of the Great Myths of the gun nut 
<br>
faction that your average criminal spends a lot of time worrying about 
<br>
whether his intended victim might be packing heat.
<br>
<p>Dunno if it still exists, but there used to be a famous cop bar not too far 
<br>
from LAPD main headquarters. It was run by a retired cop, it's where 
<br>
virtually all the patrons were off-duty (or even ON-duty) cops. It had a 
<br>
cop bar name, something like &quot;Code 40&quot; or whatever, it had cop car lights 
<br>
and police department patches decorating the interior. It was *really 
<br>
obviously* a COP BAR.
<br>
<p>And yet, one, two times a year, some jagoff would burst in waving a 
<br>
fearsome weapon like a 4-shot .22 pistol and yell, &quot;this is a stickup!&quot;
<br>
<p>Dave Palmer
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>There's a gun store here in town with an indoor pistol range.
<br>
<p>Let's be clear about this...it's a gun store.  The employees are armed (they
<br>
openly carry handguns in belt holsters).  They are, at any given time within
<br>
arms reach of several handguns and/or rifles and/or shotguns, plus boxes of
<br>
ammunition.  At any given time, there's an unknown--possibly as high as
<br>
10--number of customers in the store, WITH LOADED WEAPONS IN THEIR HANDS,
<br>
firing them at targets.  Some of these people are no doubt daydreaming about
<br>
plugging some burglar or gang member or something as they do so.
<br>
<p>And this place has been robbed at least twice in the last 10 years, both
<br>
times resulting in the robber being killed.
<br>
<p>I'm tempted to believe that people who try to rob cop bars or pistol ranges
<br>
during business hours have simply got to be trying to kill themselves...but
<br>
then I'm reminded how colossally dumb many criminals really are...
<br>
<p>Kevin
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>My first day in law school my civil procedure teacher, Jon Waltz, spent 
<br>
half the first lecture period in civ pro class telling us &quot;war stories&quot; of 
<br>
his times as a practicing lawyer (probably to impress us that he was &quot;cool&quot; 
<br>
or something), and  as a part of that presentation he imparted a piece of 
<br>
wisdom that has remained with me years after my legal career ended:
<br>
<p>&quot;Criminals are stupid. That's why they get caught.&quot;
<br>
<p>Len Cleavelin
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>They didn't teach that in law school, I had to learn that from experience.
<br>
<p>It is, in a way, unfortunate, but my experience of cops in law practice was 
<br>
such that were a cop to tell me right now that the sun is shining (it is, 
<br>
FWIW) I wouldn't believe him until I looked out the window and verified it. 
<br>
As you might imagine, that made life interesting when I married my second 
<br>
ex-wife and thereby picked up two cops as brothers-in-law.
