<p>
[I'm still having connectivity problems at home -- thus I'm using the BBS
<br>
interface for the first time.  I guess I'm old-fashioned; I still like the
<br>
email list format, but I'm having trouble sending email from home.]
<br>
<p>I’m very sorry to see Lee leave the list, but I have to count it as a mistake
<br>
on Lee’s part.  The mistake arises from what the concept of free speech means
<br>
in the specific context of this forum.  Everyone probably agrees that some
<br>
kind of specific post could justify excluding someone from the list. Hard
<br>
questions arise when we realize we almost certainly wouldn’t agree on the
<br>
precise limits beyond which a single post could justify exclusion.  We enter
<br>
the ground of irony when we realize that even some people who disagreed very
<br>
strongly with Mike Lorrey don’t support his exclusion (vid. Hubert Mania’s
<br>
post of today.)
<br>
<p>There will be even more disagreement about whether, rather than a single
<br>
post, an overall approach to posting justifies exclusion.  But we can’t
<br>
escape this hard question in maintaining an online forum.  Take a look at
<br>
almost-completely wide-open fora like Yahoo groups and BBSs: No “tone”
<br>
criteria at all are maintained there and that kind of forum is the lowest
<br>
form of online interaction as a result.  I doubt many of our subscribers and
<br>
web readers waste their time by reading such groups, even though one might
<br>
occasionally find something of value there.
<br>
<p>To return to the concept of free speech, I urge subscribers to consider that
<br>
ExI is not a government, and the values and rules regarding governmental
<br>
regulation of speech don’t necessarily translate into matters of private
<br>
list governance.  The metaphor of the salon discussed here some weeks back
<br>
is much more apt.  That metaphor ought to suggest that matters of tone and
<br>
style will be much more important in how the list can and should be governed
<br>
than the extreme sensitivity to any curtailment of the right to expression
<br>
that the metaphor of government regulation of publishing or media entails.
<br>
Persistent combativeness and lack of politeness can and should be a factor
<br>
– an important factor – in applying the sanction of exclusion in a private,
<br>
focused forum.  Someone whose posts are consistently personalistic and which
<br>
generate continuing personal unpleasantness can’t stay in a semi-public,
<br>
semi-private forum forever without the overall tone of the forum being
<br>
degraded.
<br>
<p>I know there is a core disagreement among some people about whether values
<br>
of politeness and personal tone should be a factor in list governance.  To
<br>
those who maintain that they should not, I urge you to consider that the
<br>
packaging of ideas IS important and that a community can be and will be judged
<br>
by the manners it tolerates.  Having begun with noting an element of irony,
<br>
I’ll end this overly-long post by pointing to another irony: The very act of
<br>
enforcing minimal standards of tone and style itself generates unpleasantness
<br>
and ill-feelings among many.  But this is also a challenge of freedom: Real
<br>
liberty is perforce accompanied by the duty to realize such values, or freedom
<br>
becomes corrosive to civilization.  The paradox is resolved by what many have
<br>
noted in the wake of Mike Lorrey’s exclusion: Ultimately he is free to post
<br>
elsewhere, create his own forum, post web pages, etc.
<br>
<p>Finally, I urge those who are unhappy to look again at Natasha’s post: New
<br>
organization for our discussions is in the works and any exclusion from this
<br>
forum is temporary.
