<p>This is actually another way of exploring the FP. The enforcement
<br>
system has to be able to stop replicators before they get out of
<br>
hand, and we can start constraining them by theory and maybe even 
<br>
start looking for them. 
<br>
<p>Imagine &quot;antibodies&quot; spread evenly in the galaxy, detecting the
<br>
signature of a replicator seed. They immediately launch a
<br>
lightspeed attack on the seed; this will work only if the seed has
<br>
not arrived at the target system, so the antibody has to be inside
<br>
the future lightcone of the launch event and the past lightcone of
<br>
the arrival event. Now, let the density is rho antibodies/ly^3,
<br>
the average distance between stars are D ly and seeds travel at v. 
<br>
The spatial volume of the lightcone intersection is a somewhat
<br>
troublesome intersection between an expanding and a contracting
<br>
sphere (there is a formula at
<br>
<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~apr/articles/pre2cut/node10.html">http://www.princeton.edu/~apr/articles/pre2cut/node10.html</a>). As a
<br>
rough approximation, the spatial volume where antibodies can act
<br>
is ~(pi/4) D^3 (1+c/v)^2 There has to be at least one antibody per
<br>
such volume. For the somewhat plausible v=0.3c and D=4.3 ly the
<br>
volume is ~1000 ly^3. So the density has to be ~1e-3/ly^3 or more,
<br>
or replicators would be able to get to other systems, disasseble
<br>
them and launch absurd amounts of replicators elsewhere,
<br>
overwhelming the antibodies. 
<br>
<p>This is likely a sizeable installation, since it should be able to
<br>
detect a small replicator seed (a nanoprobe launched with an
<br>
interplanetary railgun?), pinpoint its trajectory and launch an
<br>
attack that is effective over many lightyears. Sounds somewhat
<br>
implausible, which suggests more antibodies instead. I don't know
<br>
the effective range of lasers or similar beam weapons in
<br>
interstellar space (something for the SDI/ABM people to think of),
<br>
but it seems likely it is not that long compared to the distances
<br>
between stars.  Hence we should expect antibodies with an average
<br>
distance corresponding to the effective range of their weapon
<br>
rather than being relativistically limited - and this makes them
<br>
much more likely to be detected. In fact, it may even be
<br>
reasonable for the galactic club to make them relatively visible
<br>
to interplanetary civilisations, since that way emerging civs
<br>
might get the hint and abstain from doing something stupid. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if weapons can be powerful broadsides a la
<br>
supernovae or GRBs (like the Chenzeme of Nagata's books) then you
<br>
only need a few of them and will likely get the civilization that
<br>
launched them too. And it makes sense to put the antibodies in or
<br>
near the solar systems (and brown dwarves), since that is where
<br>
launches are likely. Hmm, my argument needs more analysis than I
<br>
have time for...
<br>
<p>Anyway, considering enforcement methods over interstellar 
<br>
distances might give us a new angle to deal with the paradox.
