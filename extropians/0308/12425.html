</em><br>

<p>Huh?  They already have more than sufficient ability to &quot;do something to 
<br>
someone&quot; and it is already used much to often and to deadly affect.   Would 
<br>
you really prefer that every infraction of every law that you are bound to 
<br>
commit just by being alive be duly recorded for the use of anyone at any time 
<br>
who wants to stop you and whatever works is yours dead in its tracks?  
<br>
<p>We live in a time when it is obvious great irralitionality is matched up with 
<br>
great power over our lives and futures.   The only chance we have if we 
<br>
cannot stem the tide of irrationality to a large enough degree and cannot 
<br>
sufficiently defuse the power is to be able to be at least partially covert 
<br>
in plans and activities.    I don't see what is particularly difficult to 
<br>
comprehend about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What exactly are we counting on to still have any room to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effect extropian change at all when everyone and anyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not only examine all our actions but all of our thoughts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just what are we afraid of?  Just what do we have to hide?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>See above.  It is not &quot;what we have to hide&quot; but what is not anyone's business 
<br>
but our own.  We do not have to justify private thoughts and private actions.  
<br>
Or are we so far down the totalitarian road that the desire to simply be left 
<br>
alone to one's own devices and voluntary assocations is now automatically 
<br>
suspicious and requiring public justification?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Are we expecting the vast majority to somehow become enlightened and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tolerant?    If not, then exactly what kind of game are we playing?   As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I see it the ability to see everything, including thought would result in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the worst kind of dystopia given the current nature of human beings and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; our institutions.   If you see some good airtight reason this would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be so then please share it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay: I am sure that the more they learn about us (or, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broader context of your question, the more that other parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world learn about the West), the better.  Openness rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Let's see.  Today government attempts to shut down all &quot;cloning&quot;.  Tomorrow 
<br>
they attempt to hamstring and make nearly illegal most types of nanotech and 
<br>
several varieties of AI.   Exactly what in the current shape of the world 
<br>
makes you believe such things are impossible or even unlikely?  With perfect 
<br>
oversight of all our activities and associations there is no way any of us 
<br>
will be able to proceed on such lines.    There is certainly no way we will 
<br>
be able to be covert long enough to successfully oppose or escape a society 
<br>
gone this mad.   End of story, very sad.
