The universe is gently fading into darkness according to three 
<br>
astronomers who have looked at 40,000 galaxies in the neighborhood of 
<br>
the Milky Way.
<br>
<p>&quot;Our analysis confirms that the age of star formation is drawing to a 
<br>
close&quot;, says Alan Heavens. &quot;The number of new stars being formed in the 
<br>
huge sample of galaxies we studied has been in decline for around 6 
<br>
billion years - roughly since the time our own Sun came into being.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Stars are formed in galaxies and there was a peak in the rate at which 
<br>
galaxies formed, and that time has passed and been and gone,&quot; Prof 
<br>
Heavens said.
<br>
<p>Professor Tony Hewish, who won the Nobel prize in 1974 for his work in 
<br>
discovering quasars at Cambridge University, said the dimming effect 
<br>
would be made worse by those bright stars that did remain being spread 
<br>
further apart as the universe expanded.
<br>
<p>&quot;We live in an accelerating universe now and so, as time goes on, the 
<br>
density of galaxies is going to thin out,&quot; he said. &quot;As far as we know 
<br>
the universe as it is now is going to expand for ever, so ultimately it 
<br>
must do something like that.&quot;
<br>
End quotes.
<br>
<p><p>So apparently there are no signs of new energy being created by alien 
<br>
civilizations in the 40,000 galaxies surveyed. It all seems to be 
<br>
gradually dying out. And they are dying out in line with the natural 
<br>
lifespan of stars - not because they are being put in a box and used as 
<br>
batteries. :)
