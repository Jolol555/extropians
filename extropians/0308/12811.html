<p>When I was in college, I did some pretty silly things in the art 
<br>
department.  I covered an entire floor of the academy and called it 
<br>
Performance Art.  Other things, I'd hardly admit to :-)
<br>
<p>When Max started ExI he was at university and in his 20s.  The journalist 
<br>
who wrote &quot;that&quot; article represented extropians as a type of intellectual, 
<br>
radical group of folks.  This was all true.  Even though I remained on the 
<br>
outskirts of extropians at that time (I was more a transhumanist and didn't 
<br>
fit into the group), I had a lot of respect for these folks.  First, 
<br>
because I had been there and done that radical thang.  Second because I was 
<br>
much older and out of school for quite some time.  Regardless, the hand 
<br>
shake, jokes, radical nature, intellectual debates and very smart ideas 
<br>
were something that attracted me to Max and extropy.
<br>
<p>I think we should just laugh it off as past. Our future will certainly make 
<br>
all that seem fun, light-hearted, and insignificant.
