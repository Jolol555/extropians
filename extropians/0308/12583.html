If we had entanglement linkages built into M-brains, then there would be 
<br>
no practical limit (foreseeable from here) to the degree of 
<br>
intelligence.  Actually, a lot of things would depend on the exact 
<br>
nature of the link.  If it had a long start-up delay, or was expensive 
<br>
to use (say, emitted a lot of heat, or had a slow bit rate), then there 
<br>
could well still be speed limits in how fast the final 
<br>
M-brain-with-quantum-link could think, but I can't see any limit on the 
<br>
size of problem that it could solve.  Merely on the speed at which it 
<br>
could be solved.  I suppose that one could say that the same is, in 
<br>
principle, true of even a simple Turing machine, but this isn't the same 
<br>
kind of limit.  The separable parts could be handled separately...
<br>
<p>If the link were fast and cheap enough it could replace everything else 
<br>
for linking components.  This is quite unlikely, but who can say.  It 
<br>
would be equivalent to seeing the universe as it exists as a computer 
<br>
that one could program.
<br>
<p>If the link were somewhat expensive, but had a fast bit-rate, then 
<br>
M-Brain modules would get, say, as large as a desk, or perhaps a shoebox 
<br>
and these modules would be linked using some development from, perhaps, 
<br>
Beowulf technology (or Globus?).  Thus each M-Brain module would have 
<br>
perhaps 1000 times the computing capacity of a human brain (or more, I'm 
<br>
being a bit conservative here) and these modules would be linked 
<br>
&quot;instantaneously&quot; to a net which could be spatially distributed 
<br>
throughout the universe.  One has to hope that there are a large number 
<br>
of &quot;frequencies&quot; available.  I find myself believing that were this to 
<br>
be possible, the first civilization to discover how to do it would 
<br>
saturate the available frequencies, and latecomers would only find a 
<br>
channel too noisy to use.  (The earlier developers would be frequencies 
<br>
so high and spread across the available spectrum that those coming later 
<br>
wouldn't find an available channel, or a readable signal.)
<br>
<p>If the link were fast and cheap, but short range (say an exponential 
<br>
decay), then everything depends on the available distance.  If it's 
<br>
across the solar system, then M-Brains could be a lot more efficient 
<br>
than we have believed.  If it's across the hall, then it wouldn't have 
<br>
much effect at all, but it might up the rate of bit transmission a bit.
<br>
<p>Simply having the possibility of a quantuum linkage doesn't tell one 
<br>
enough about the engineering trade-offs.  And since we don't yet know 
<br>
how to do it, we don't know what the constraints and limitations would 
<br>
be.  But unless we're the first it seems to range from &quot;interesting but 
<br>
not really worth the effort&quot; up to &quot;quite handy, and well worth the 
<br>
cost&quot;.  Only towards the high end of the scale do we start noticing 
<br>
significant performance changes in the M-Brains.  At the nearly top end 
<br>
(practical signalling extends out to around 8 light years with a high 
<br>
bit rate) we get a dramatic change where the universe becomes accessible 
<br>
for total conversions into a single intelligence.  (This says nothing 
<br>
about whether such a choice is wise or ethical.)
