through

the
<br>
<em>&gt; 1800s and somewhat beyond:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;... From the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, many young children in America
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked long hours in a variety of dangerous environments, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing and mining. Not only did they miss the opportunity to go to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; school and receive an education, but some even lost their health and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives. It was because of these tragedies that U.S. child labor laws came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into effect.&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.njsbf.com/njsbf/student/eagle/spring01-1.cfm">http://www.njsbf.com/njsbf/student/eagle/spring01-1.cfm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;With heavy labor came long hours and rarely did the pay increase despite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the grueling hours and often dangerous working environments. Over time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irish Americans banded together to organize unions and improve the working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions of all laborers. In 1879, Terence Powderly, a son of Irish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigrants, was elected head of the Knights of Labor, a national
</em><br>
association
<br>
<em>&gt; of labor unions. Under his stewardship, it grew to include more than
</em><br>
700,000
<br>
<em>&gt; members....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With the increase in numbers, the unions' ability to facilitate strikes
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; boycotts posed a real threat to industries. Soon negotiations were taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place and the working conditions for U.S. laborers began to improve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dramatically.&quot;:

<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The mistreatment of child workers is not just a foreign problem. Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonial times, the U.S. has counted on children to lend a helping hand in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its fields and factories. In the 1800s, children as young as 7 worked in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; textile mills for 12 hours a day. Bad behavior sent a child straight to
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; 'whipping room' for punishment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1938 a federal law was passed that set child-labor guidelines, limiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work hours for kids and requiring safe conditions.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/magazines/story/0,6277,94603,00.html">http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/magazines/story/0,6277,94603,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Throughout the 1800s, women began to enter industry in large numbers.
</em><br>
Their
<br>
<em>&gt; jobs were primarily sex-segregated with most working in textiles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing, and domestic services. These women worked in extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhealthy, dangerous conditions for wages even worse than for their male
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterparts. In this climate, it was women who bore the triple burden of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploitation by the factory owners, of having no voice in the government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and of the attacks by many male workers and sexist unions that feared the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition women represented. It was Lucy Parsons, the radical
</em><br>
multi-racial
<br>
<em>&gt; anarcho-feminist, who summed up the condition of women in the six simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words: &quot;'We are the slaves of slaves.'&quot; :

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V122/N10/col10brice.10c.html">http://www-tech.mit.edu/V122/N10/col10brice.10c.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You get the picture.  There's a *ton* of information about working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions (or working restrictions) in the USA during the 19th century.
</em><br>
Go
<br>
<em>&gt; ahead - anybody - defend them if you can.
</em><br>
<p>### Let me try my hand at defending the indefensible.
<br>
<p>Lots of people are bad. They wouldn't share a surplus even if this meant
<br>
others dying. In fact, in the absence of coercion, almost all people are bad
<br>
in this way, including you, Olga. Since, as I presume, you have not shared
<br>
all of your resources not crucial for survival with Sudanese slaves, you are
<br>
bad too. There are people dying out there, but you are not helping them.
<br>
And I am bad as well. The only non-bad person I know, is Eliezer, I think.
<br>
<p>So what's wrong with being bad, if everybody is doing it, while preaching
<br>
for others to be good? Nothing. The word, as applied above, loses its
<br>
meaning. The communal-sharing, or equality-matching relational schemata
<br>
underlying the reasoning behind the injunction to share surplus and maintain
<br>
equality, are ethically meaningless, once you start building ethical systems
<br>
using logical means, based directly on volition, rather than an
<br>
unquestioning carryover of specialized social schemata, which worked well
<br>
for survival in the EEA, but now impede progress.
<br>
<p>Progress is good. Economic progress is good, since it gives humans a better
<br>
ability to fulfill their wishes, which is the essence of doing anything at
<br>
all. Any vestigial mental quirk, such as tribalism, income-egalitarianism,
<br>
acceptance of authority,  that limits economic progress is bad, because it
<br>
destroys the coherence of our goal systems. Incoherent goal systems cannot
<br>
be satisfied. If you covet the richer human's resources, but jealously guard
<br>
your own from poorer ones, you will never move forward, and you will
<br>
interfere with the progress of others.
<br>
<p>Economic progress must be maximized, within a coherent, volitionist ethical
<br>
framework. This might mean using moral symmetry, Rawlsian reciprocity, and a
<br>
few other heuristics which have been found to aid economic progress, while
<br>
rejecting egalitarianism, tribalism, male/female chauvinism, taboos, and
<br>
everything else that interferes with economic growth.
<br>
<p>It is good to be rich. Therefore, anything that interferes with the growth
<br>
of the average sentient's income, is bad. It doesn't matter of you share
<br>
with others, or if you hoard. The only thing that matters is how much you
<br>
contribute to the average increase in wealth. Feelings of fairness, justice,
<br>
are wrong, if they interfere with the growth of average income of the
<br>
Rawlsian observer.
<br>
<p>All the emotionally rousing images you quoted, for the rational thinker, are
<br>
yet another reason to support economic growth, while maintaining individual
<br>
freedom. Henry Ford did more for American children than the nameless
<br>
bureaucrats who drafted child labor laws. Once the children's parents became
<br>
rich enough, children's labor stopped being a problem. World War II did as
<br>
much for women as feminism - once women entered the labor pool, they learned
<br>
that economic competition gives them the power that comes from financial
<br>
independence. Technical progress did more for the Irish than the Irish
<br>
themselves, and certainly more than the greedy labor unions, which later all
<br>
but destroyed  the automobile industry - now most Irish are many times
<br>
richer than the Britons who oppressed them.
<br>
<p>To point at the misery of the 19th century, and claim that it is a good
<br>
justification for laws which, as a side effect, may impede economic growth,
<br>
is wrong. It is not the laws forced by the social progressives that are
<br>
socially progressive, it was the growth of average incomes that is the
<br>
source of true progress.
<br>
<p>The working conditions of the 19th century were wrong, because most people
<br>
were then poor, and it is wrong to be poor. Concentrate on creating wealth,
<br>
not righting wrongs, and all wrongs will right themselves.
<br>
