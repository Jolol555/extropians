<p>I sent him an earlier draft of the following missive. 
<br>
Use it however you will: as is, or modified/edited, or
<br>
as a jumping off point, or not at all.
<br>
<p>(You may find the hostility toward religion
<br>
impolitic.)
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My guess is that people don't yet realize how
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;handy&quot; an indefinite lifespan will be.&quot;

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------
<br>
<p>Dear Director Hollister,  
<br>
<p>I am a member of the Cryonics Institute.  I need to be
<br>
assured that their services are available to me when
<br>
the time comes.  Your interference with their
<br>
operations is uncalled for, represents ignorance of or
<br>
indifference to the scientific basis and the
<br>
life-saving intent of the practice, violates the
<br>
fundamental right of each individual to self-defense
<br>
and to the right to choose one's own medical care, and
<br>
violates both the freedom of religion and the
<br>
separation of church and state.  On a more personal
<br>
level, setting aside the broad and egregious assault
<br>
on my human rights, it constitutes a direct threat to
<br>
my life.  
<br>
<p>The vast majority of individuals who are signed-up
<br>
with cryonics organizations are among the most
<br>
technically sophisticated people in the world.  They
<br>
see the possibilities the future holds, in stark
<br>
contrast to the rest of the population of the
<br>
&quot;civilized&quot; world, who are almost completely ignorant
<br>
of even the basics of present day science and
<br>
technology.  This is the same science and technology
<br>
which, since the time of Galileo, has struggled to
<br>
promote truth and rationality against the forces of
<br>
mysticism and prejudice. The same science and
<br>
technology and truth and rationality has given us the
<br>
very civilization we today celebrate and enjoy:
<br>
unprecedented levels of material abundance, comfort,
<br>
safety, freedom, and, to enjoy it, a healthy lifespan
<br>
two and a half times greater than the brief and
<br>
brutish span of the jungle from which science has
<br>
lifted us.  Everything we are, everything we have
<br>
built proclaims that science and rationality delivers,
<br>
mysticism and prejudice destroys.
<br>
<p>The same vast majority of people who consider cryonics
<br>
to be a sham, due so not on the basis of scientific
<br>
training, but rather on the basis of cultural
<br>
prejudices, superstition (which they call religion),
<br>
and a slavish adherence convention.  Fine for them. 
<br>
This is their protected right, founded on this
<br>
country's tradition of freedom of religion.  No matter
<br>
the foolishness, no matter the dogma, the funny hats,
<br>
or the arcane rituals, as long as it's in the name of
<br>
some &quot;sky Santa&quot; (ie god), it's politically pandered
<br>
to and protected.  Fine.  I stand resolute in defense
<br>
of their rights.  By that same standard I absolutely
<br>
require for myself the same right to personal belief
<br>
and practice.  I place my faith in science and
<br>
rationality.  I do not reject religion for any who
<br>
care to believe, but I most strongly protest when my
<br>
preference of science in favor of religion threatens
<br>
to make me a victim of those whose religious
<br>
prejudices conflict with my rationalist preferences. 
<br>
And that is precisely what you are up to, Director
<br>
Hollister, in your present assault on the Cryonics
<br>
Institute.  
<br>
<p>I do not know if your action arises out of political
<br>
pandering to the religious majority, personal
<br>
religious prejudice, a lack of technical
<br>
sophistication, or if it is simply a bureaucratic
<br>
blunder, but you need to stop it now, and return to
<br>
looking for something socially constructive to do.  I
<br>
dare say there are plenty of REAL problems out there
<br>
that could use your attention.
<br>
<p>If you need someone to help you understand what
<br>
cryonics is about--and judging from the actions you've
<br>
taken, I'd say you do, and desperately--I offer my
<br>
assistance.  But I prefer to make this &quot;offer&quot; more
<br>
forcefully.  You are, either capriciously or in an
<br>
uninformed fashion, carrying out what amounts to a
<br>
life-threatening assault on a minority whose beliefs
<br>
differ from yours and those of the social majority. 
<br>
As such, I feel entitled to require that my views be
<br>
heard in this matter.  You have already violated the
<br>
legally protected rights of others.  The proper course
<br>
of action now must be to cease and desist, and to make
<br>
yourself available to those who can provide you with
<br>
the information needed to understand why what you have
<br>
done is a violation of rights, and how in future to
<br>
adhere to the principle of protection rather than
<br>
violation of rights.
<br>
<p>I am not the only person qualified too help you in
<br>
this matter, but I believe that my depth of experience
<br>
with cryonics makes me among the most skilled
<br>
proponents of the practice.
<br>
<p>You will find my personal information below.  Please
<br>
contact me as an expert in these matters--a
<br>
&quot;cryoethicist&quot; if you will--and notify me as to any
<br>
public hearings, commissions of inquiry, and most
<br>
importantly any legal proceedings related to this
<br>
matter.
