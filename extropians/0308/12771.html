<p>Yeah, here is the lead paragraph from that: 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hollywood fantasy?  Perhaps, but job stress is a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leading cause of illness, depression and work
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place violence in America today and is increasing,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experts say.
<br>
<p>As compared to what?  As compared to when?  The 20th century
<br>
wasn't any picnic, nor was the 19th.  And if you want to
<br>
make yourself sick, read carefully about ancient times.
<br>
<p>&quot;Increasing&quot;.  Sure, maybe over the last three years as many
<br>
people learned the truth about how much money they were making
<br>
and how &quot;great&quot; everything was in the bubble.
<br>
<p>The fault I spoke of above can be evenly divided between
<br>
two groups.  The first is &quot;workers&quot; who have natural human
<br>
resentment of achievement and who in addition have fallen
<br>
for propaganda directed at management and entrepreneurs.
<br>
The second is all the Marxists and left-leaning elements
<br>
of society that teach that being a business person or 
<br>
entrepreneur is giving in to &quot;them&quot; and trying to be like
<br>
&quot;them&quot;.  Subtly or not so subtly, many working class people
<br>
grow up practically thinking themselves to be a kind of 
<br>
traitor should they think of starting their own business.
<br>
<p>Instead of starting businesses, the goal of both these
<br>
groups the last 150 years has been to &quot;organize&quot;, and
<br>
try to deprive entrepreneurs of their property:  most
<br>
crucially, why don't &quot;workers&quot; who are often in oversupply
<br>
historically, go start their own businesses?  Mostly due
<br>
to the aforesaid propaganda: it serves leftist politicians
<br>
and theoreticians to keep such ideas out of the heads of
<br>
&quot;the masses&quot; so as to increase their own relative importance.
