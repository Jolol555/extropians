Ron H.
<br>
&lt;&lt;Mitch,
<br>
       You gave us a link to IMB's last three Annual Statements.  Isn't that 
<br>
Income Statement revealing?
<br>
       The big decline in Operating Profits seems to be due to the President 
<br>
and the Sales/Marketing departments not delivering the sales that are their 
<br>
responsibility to deliver.  I don't see any numbers to indicate to me that 
<br>
IMB 
<br>
ran into problems because EDP was deficient.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Most of these Fart-500 companies are off-shoring (not to Canada, not to 
<br>
Mexico) because they are focusing on merely leaving their companies appearing 
<br>
strong (in quaterly reports) to the stockholders. Off-shoring is only concerned 
<br>
with saving money, rather than producing new goods and services Ron. This is 
<br>
merely a smoke and mirrors play to deceive the stockholders and then (the 
<br>
executives) take their golden parachutes, before the ceiling crashes in. Musical 
<br>
chairs, not due to competition, but deception. 
<br>
<p>The prez, due to his cosy feelings for these crooks, and his lack of 
<br>
response,
<br>
will likely, lose the election, now. In an enlightend capital economy, both 
<br>
boards of directors and employees should work toward mutually beneficial goals, 
<br>
at least some of the time. In the minds of the CEO's and their lackeys, 
<br>
America will stand together and everything will be all right, as new jobs are 
<br>
produced. Unfortunately this is not the way the economy is now working (post 9-11) 
<br>
and all the cuts by Greenspan have produced jack shit, except for the housing 
<br>
market. My guess is there will be new laws, limiting the off-shoring of jobs, 
<br>
limiting the importation of H1-B's and L2's.  
<br>
<p>Opinions?
