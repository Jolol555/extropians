<em>&gt; Excellent post! Right in line with my recent thoughts. This really

</em><br>
<em>&gt; has helped lead to the increasing age at which one may draw SS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits (was 62, now 65, soon to be 67). We need to take a look at
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly reduce benefits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but governments are not trying to increase the official
<br>
retirement age because of neoconservative propaganda.
<br>
<p>The problem is that the money is running out.
<br>
<p>The western European countries have a huge pensions problem looming over
<br>
them. It is so bad that even politicians who will do anything to remain
<br>
in power, are taking hugely unpopular measures like reducing pensions
<br>
and benefits and increasing the retirement age.
<br>
<p>The aging population problem (people living longer and having fewer
<br>
children) means that fewer and fewer working people are paying taxes to
<br>
support more and more 'retired' people. And it will reach crunch point
<br>
in just a few years.
<br>
<p>Many people are depending on company pensions for their retirement. But
<br>
since the stock market collapse and many companies going bust making
<br>
their shares worthless, company pension schemes are in big trouble. In
<br>
some cases the 'black hole' in their pension scheme fund is greater than 
<br>
the worth of the company. They are stopping new members to their old 
<br>
scheme and providing a much lower benefit scheme for new employees. And 
<br>
hoping that the stock market will recover enough before they have to 
<br>
meet all their pension scheme commitments.
<br>
Some people call this 'whistling in the wind'.
<br>
<p>I entirely agree that early retirement is a good thing and will mean a
<br>
longer life, as the statistics from David A. Kekich show.
<br>
<p>But, How to fund it?, is a non-trivial problem while we are still in a
<br>
resource scarce environment.
<br>
