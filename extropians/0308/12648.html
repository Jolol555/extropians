<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; There are some classes of pre-emptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action made on the basis of genuinely held, earnestly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasoned (note I am not touching *belief* here) views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that would require action in my view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; trying to justify a pre-emptive measure on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notion that is &quot;genuinely held&quot; or &quot;earnestly reasoned&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a rationalization in my opinion, generally to excuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the type of behavior you are engaging in...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;By including the word 'generally' above aren't you in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact conceding my point? I.E. in *some* specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances pre-emptive action *is* morally justified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; reread what i wrote; I clearly state it is a rationalization,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then apply generally by way of a cause.  I am simply stating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there may be other reasons to rationalize other than seeking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an excuse for preemptive action...
</em><br>
<p>Your right. I stand corrected (I moved the comma in reading).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  the limit on this line of reasoning though, is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; duration of the act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; .... for instance, say you were prescient, and saw a man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who was going to mug you (with a knife) 10 minutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from now, and hit him over a head; then you would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acting morally (given ur prescience).  Lets say you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not prescient, and you hit  him over the head on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibility that he might mug you; than you are acting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immorally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; In the real world, where our moral judgement is supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to assist us, (or at least that is my contention) we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *never* fully prescient and so there is always *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance the suspected or likely mugger may not in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mug us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; perhaps; in real life, I generally prepare for the attack,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than instigate a pre-emptive attack.
</em><br>
<p>There a couple of ramifications to this. First you leave your
<br>
opponent with more degrees of freedom and more power
<br>
than if you take the initiative. So you take on more risk.
<br>
Second would you not agree that the circumstances
<br>
change when one has others under ones authority or
<br>
control like a leader, a military commander, or a president
<br>
who has to be able to think in terms of minimising loss
<br>
of life sometimes when the other is clearly intending on
<br>
taking life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Assuming one values oneself, how can we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise than weigh up the chances as best we can?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My answer - we can't. Therefore the point becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how best we can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; learn to recognize (and avoid) abuse and abusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors..  that includes learning not to abuse others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an attempt to prevent said abuse.
</em><br>
<p>Where this works and it often would its laudable. Sometimes
<br>
though the abusive behavior cannot be avoided. Such is
<br>
the human condition. Some folks will go out of their way
<br>
to remove the option of avoiding them. The irony of
<br>
being free is that others are two and the person who
<br>
decides to compete or predate on one immediately
<br>
reduces ones degrees of freedom. The reactor has
<br>
less practical choices than the actor. The actor can
<br>
compete, cooperate or ignore. The reactor can be
<br>
forced to compete (or be defeated), cooperate or
<br>
not, but hardly ignore a person determined to compete.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; At this point I think its worth distinguishing between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a moral code, which may be a preconsidered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework that one uses to help reach a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral judgement and moral judgements per se.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; There are *no* moral codes that provide definitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers to all the moral dilemmas that arise just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are no maps on a scale of 1:1, therefore whenever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a particular moral judgement is required there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dodging that the subjective individual must make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which or without the benefit of a more or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated moral code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I see things in black and white;  I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a particularly sophisticated moral code; just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated world-view.  The rules themselves are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite easy.  I might add that you can generate a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world view from an array of black/white values... and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it is a matter of black and white values, then my moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code does have a 1-to-1 correspondence.
</em><br>
<p>Then if you've codified to 1-to-1 (ie. predecided what you
<br>
will do in all possible moral dilemnas) then can the future
<br>
not throw you a curly one at all that will require you to
<br>
make a new judgement?
<br>
<p>For instance say that IVF technology was improved to
<br>
the point that a given embryo was more likely to go
<br>
through to a health birth than the more than 70% from
<br>
memory that naturally abort.
<br>
<p>What would be your moral position if you were a
<br>
superior court judge and a state governement wanted
<br>
to pass a law that all reproduction should be via IVF
<br>
as that wasted less embryos than reproduction by the
<br>
natural method. Would your moral code cover that
<br>
- with the consequence that all sex for pleasure must
<br>
involve careful steps to avoid reckless and risky
<br>
procreation or would you have to think anew guided
<br>
by your moral code perhaps but not being able to do
<br>
a one to one look up to say point 356 of your specific
<br>
code?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lets say you are not prescient, and he is mugging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone else (as it is apparent to you from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vantage point), and you intervene by hitting him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over the head... Then you're actions may or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not be immoral, on the basis that he may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the one doing the mugging, but rather, may be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; muggee.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Actually I'd say in the circumstances you describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the person *has* acted morally, but with poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement, so poor in fact that they may be found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have acted illegally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; you would; I would not; the reason being that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper action is to act to separate them, without harming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one party or the another precisely because you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ill-informed.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. I'm around 6 foot, weight around 90 kilo and
<br>
am a former state karate champion. Yet there are some
<br>
males that are so much stronger than me that I would not
<br>
be able to separate them as you say. Yet as a third
<br>
party coming onto the scene with them grappling with
<br>
other I would in all likelihood be able to render on or
<br>
the other unconscious having the advantage of the
<br>
element of surprise (as indeed could my youngest
<br>
sister, who is much lighter and has no special training
<br>
in any martial arts, if she kept her wits about her).
<br>
<p>Your scenario contains details for you that I didn't
<br>
see. Those details change the context. One must
<br>
act in real time within the context with the options
<br>
that one has. If the two protagonists were school
<br>
boys then separating them might be relatively easy
<br>
and involve only words. It depends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You should have a duty (under your moral code)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to negotiate in good faith, and having said that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have an obligation to do due diligence in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to (as completely as possible) understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the situation.  Properly exercised restraint is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remarkeably under-appreciated quality.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. But &quot;due&quot; diligence depends on the
<br>
circumstances. Too much diligence, too much
<br>
forebearance is also a risk. The weighting of the
<br>
risks is a moral judgement that the individual
<br>
cannot get away from as no code can fully
<br>
anticipate all contingencies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The point being that you have to consider the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; granularity of the event, the knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you had as an autonomous agent, the environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you're in, and the action chosen, and the outcome of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that action...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Sure. But the &quot;you&quot; in this case is a subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual using their own judgement, when such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement may or may not be particularly good. So it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also behooves us to consider the granularity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *moral code* that is taken  by many of us into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  situations where it can guide particular  moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  judgements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; judgement and morality are entertwined, no?
</em><br>
<p>I certainly think so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you can't have a good moral code if you're judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is consistently unable to judge according to that moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code..
</em><br>
<p>I think I see your point. A better code, one that endorses
<br>
reasoning rather than believing as a means to making
<br>
decisions, is a better guide to moral behavior, but we
<br>
can never have a code so good that the need for moral
<br>
judgments disappear altogether unless there are no
<br>
new challenges thrown at us, like the challenges that
<br>
technologies might throw up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to granularity of a moral code, I think it is sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to establish a clearly understood (objective) test is in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to determine that level of granularity by which any particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral code can be applied to...
</em><br>
<p>Most people in society are probably not operating on say level
<br>
5 of Kohlbergs levels or moral reasoning.  But the brighter
<br>
more abstract thinkers that are likely to rise to positions of
<br>
power are more likely to be better abstract thinkers and
<br>
reasoners. (They may also be better rationalizers on occassion
<br>
but a rationalization is a deceit one practices on oneself).
<br>
Your rationalisation won't convince me and vice versa.
<br>
You or I can have a moral discussion and seek to change
<br>
each others views using reason and a common language but
<br>
if either of us held that we were absolutely right to believe
<br>
what we believe then there would be little possibility of
<br>
communication and cooperation between us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;If one is running around in 2003 holding that the 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commandments are all the moral code that is needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is going to come up against some particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curly challenges in interpreting how to operationalise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the directive that though shalt not kill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;Even this simple edict is subject to interpretation. Life in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2003 is known to take place on more than the organismic level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cells are alive. And human cancer cells are human life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; sure if you don't consider that human cancer cells replicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through meisos rather than fertilization. of course (and this would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be VERY interesting); what would happen if a cancer colony was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to generate say sperm.... would it be considered life...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intriguing thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;Clearly it is absurb to argue that a cancer cell or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiples of them are of moral weight with a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dying of cancer. Yet this is not much of an exaggeration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the proposition that say all embryos are a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human life when by human life what is obviously meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is personhood.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I say tear it out of the womb and see if it survives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unaided.  if it does, boom, human being.  if it doesn't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well then, at best it was an incomplete human being who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; died.  There is no inherent reason to relegate women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the equivalent of biological life carriers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before laws can be set that codify legally what may and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be done it is prudent to have a moral disucssion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the words we use do not obfuscate the reals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues at hand. Issues such as how does a civil society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight the rights or potential persons (embryos, fetus etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at different stages). When we do not decide or address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these questions public policy continues to be made on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basis of outdated moral and legal codes. And persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffer needlessly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; Oh I would agree :) regarding a code of laws being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unduly influenced by any one particular moral code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I don't think laws should attempt to legislate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.  It is up to people to do that.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. And if we consider that each of us is a person
<br>
we get to &quot;to thine ownself be true&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snipped stuff on legal code &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course you could always say (arbitrarily) that I was reacting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the best of my abilities to the best of my knowledge ergo my action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was moral by my system of morals/ethics.... But I tend to think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that as a cop-out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Really? I think the key word here is 'tend'. How could you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put a moral obligation on someone to act better than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best of their abilities and knowledge?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I don't in real life; I hold everybody to the same standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I hold myself to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Do you think there is a moral sphere separate from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal sphere? Some apparently don't. I think the legal sphere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is smaller than the morals sphere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I think the two are completely seperate systems; that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say a legal code cannot borrow from an established moral code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or vice versa in cases where moral codes are not derived from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an unchangeable word of god).
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Interestingly though legal systems do seem to put a higher
<br>
or more formal emphasis on reasoning and the processes by which
<br>
conclusions are reached. Juries work to beyond &quot;reasonable&quot; doubt
<br>
standards not to mere &quot;belief&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In relation to your secondary point (stated in this letter); I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; really don't think morality has anything necessarily to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; self-delusion, or the acknowledgement thereof. Or rather, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; no truth that states necessarily you  have to be honest, ergo an act
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of dishonesty (as it relates to self-delusion) does not violate any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; particularly great truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; First the status of morality and the rationality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethics is pretty widely regarded at least so far as I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aware in philosophical circles as being almost a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (eg. Bertrand Russell. History of Western Philosophy).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I'm sure it is; until you run into an event that requires faith
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or belief outside of rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Actually I think BR would hold the line even in the face of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But BR overlooked a few things as Godel pointed out. Maybe he abandoned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the search for a rational ethics too early.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I never read BR so I can't really comment on his particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical bent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my circuit on philosophy keeps getting delayed; I can't stand wading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats no relevant (given my stripped down operating assumptions).  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think someday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll get bored enough to get to the juicy parts [probably in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condensed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of all the philosophies].
</em><br>
<p>Its been argued that all academic disciplines are descendants of
<br>
philosophy. I am interested in philosophy not because it it esoteric
<br>
though it can be but because it can suggest solutions to problems.
<br>
<p>My interest in morality and ethics for instance pretty much goes
<br>
back to a desire to build stronger societies and more effective
<br>
cooperatives because in this way I can do more, be more and
<br>
enjoy doing it better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ergo if I'm marooned on a desert island for 60 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does it really make a damned difference if I hallucinate marilyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; monroe on the island with me in order to remain sane?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Legally no. Morally? Depends. By the code I've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing it *would* make a difference if there was some net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference in utility to you. ie. If you really *could* make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision to hallucinate to preserve your sanity (or not) then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'd argue the moral choice is the one that you *think* will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in the best  outcome for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ergo my confusion since I thought you stated that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-delusion was immoral.
</em><br>
<p>I should confess, I do think on my feet and in dialogs like
<br>
this which I greatly enjoy my arguments at the end are likely
<br>
to be sharper clearer and more nuanced becuase I've
<br>
integrated (I hope) the valid criticisms and viewpoints that
<br>
you bring up. Another positive to reasoning versers
<br>
believing. Both sides can win.
<br>
<p>On the specific point I would say that my code would
<br>
say that self delusion is immoral. Thats what I'd endeavor
<br>
to teach children but I'd also point out that its nature
<br>
and in some circumstances moral judgements that take
<br>
in the fuller context and detail than any moral code
<br>
(that is codified) are going to be refinements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and yes, you can make a decision to hallucinate...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same as you can wake up (out of the equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of a dream) when you are rescued.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps we have different concepts of what
<br>
constitutes an hallucination. I don't think
<br>
fantasy = hallucination. I think hallucination is likely to
<br>
have a medical/physiological cause and not be
<br>
volitional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether it would in fact yeild the best outcome for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you is not the point  as the  facts of the outcome are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not knowable to you at the time you decide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I would say that they are; I would say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only reason to willing self-delude yourself via fantasy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever is specifically because you have examined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the outcomes and decided that reality sucked and you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do better.
</em><br>
<p>I see. You are interchanging fantasy and self-delusion. I
<br>
tend to think of fantasy as suspension of disbelief. One
<br>
knows one is doing it and one is doing it for fun.
<br>
<p>Self-delusion on the other hand - one probably suspects
<br>
one is doing it at some level unless ones rational aspects
<br>
are completely shut down - but delusons I think of as
<br>
things we don't have for fun, but for other perhaps
<br>
more serious pyschological basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would say that you would end up having to constantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (subconsciously)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moniter reality to decide when you would come out of ur protective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Now thats the moral code. The reason for the moral code is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that usually judgements will be required in real life which one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot anticipate and the better, the more sophisticated your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral code the better, (the more enlightened) your judgement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your own best interests will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; again I balk at the requirement for a sophisticated moral code;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can have an incredibly simple moral code; but apply it through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the use of a sophisticated world view (ergo ur judgement).
</em><br>
<p>A person who is reasoning at level 1 on Kohlburgs scale (the
<br>
simplest) may not do something that is good for society in general
<br>
but for far more basic reasons, than a person who is reasoning
<br>
at level 5.
<br>
<p>But the higher up in the levels one goes the more levels or
<br>
abstraction and nuance are likely to influence your code.
<br>
I would think that a person would have a hard time having
<br>
a complex moral code without having the ability to use language
<br>
for instance.
<br>
<p>Our leaders must make judgements that will have impacts
<br>
on lives other than their own. The more of us that are reasoners
<br>
and critical thinkers and the fewer of us that are mere believers
<br>
the better (the healthier) we will be as a society in my opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; In this particular case I don't think there is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latitude for  immoral action as you really would be alone on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the desert island in the situation you stipulate. Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the situation you stipulate could not  arise. One would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never know one was going to be marooned for sixty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years AND CHOOSE to hallucinate. Hallucinations for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the most part are going to be dysfunctional even on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; .. for the most part?
</em><br>
<p>Fair catch that does look like a slippery phrase doesn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and I do dispute ur choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hallucinate;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-hypnosis?
</em><br>
<p>No. I am an open minded sceptic when it comes to
<br>
conventional hypnosis. I have never experienced it
<br>
and those that I have seen ostensibly hypnotised on
<br>
stage seemed to me to be substantially &quot;hamming&quot;
<br>
or playing it up for the attention. I think some of
<br>
us sometimes like not having to be analytical all
<br>
the time and to have others tell us what to do
<br>
and just follow alone can be pleasant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can get urself into a deep enough trance, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-hypnotic suggestions that trigger when you wake... including the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post hypnotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestion to renew itself until you are rescued.  And you can cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hallucinations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a deep enough trance btw.  And thats not even calling upon the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mystics, or people who have sufficiently advanced manipulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques...
</em><br>
<p>I don't know if I can get into a trance as you put it. I guess I
<br>
can its just not something I am very familiar with.
<br>
<p>I suppose when it comes to my mind I am a bit of a control
<br>
freak, I don't like it when the captain is not on the bridge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I tend towards a function and dysfunctional definition of sanity; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its dysfunctional, then you are not being ethical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; This seems to be confounding sanity with ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not really :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Which is problematic if the insane cannot make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound judgements in their own interests by virtue of being insane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ergo my distinction between function and dysfunctional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insanity.
</em><br>
<p>Is there a functional form of insanity? As I understand it insanity
<br>
is usually diagnosed on the basis of behavior. If is inferred rather
<br>
than experimentally verified. Insanity is apparently easy to fake.
<br>
Sanity on the other hand - now theres a challlenge :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  if its functional, you are being ethical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and since functionality is related to the environment you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; operating in, ergo my comment about self-delusion not really having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything to do with morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I definately think everyone is engaged in it to some degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (self-delusion), and to the extent that it helps you, its ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; So do I. The human condition is mortal. It would hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behoove us to dwell on it excessively and abandon hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when there was none. Perhaps the illusion of a life after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death only becomes dysfunctional when it gets in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the realisation of longer life in practice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; In the vast majority of cases self-delusion *is* going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmful. In those circumstances where it is not harmful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone including the person who is self-deluded then I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree it not immoral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ok well then we've settled that line of logic :)
</em><br>
<p>Hooray :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; I find this conclusion (Bertrand Russell's)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; powerful, dangerous and deeply unsatisfying so I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; keen to have at it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I was just telling my little sister yesterday about one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classical issues in my life (at one point during my younger years); at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what point does being too intelligent start to harm you (the classic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; form being, if you could trade intelligence for gauranteed happiness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would you do it)... most intelligent people say no; I think the really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent people though, when they consider it, say yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I think this is pure speculation. Would a less intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you be you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; does it make a difference if you are gauranteed to be happy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; If you think so there may be possibilites for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to chart a life for yourself that involves more happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and less intellect. But personally I don't think so. How do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you aim at happiness without identifying something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will make you happy. Happiness is not itself a thing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be persued.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ergo my point :) if you can't gaurantee happiness by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method of intelligence, and some mythical blue genie (whom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the best of your abilities to discern is capable of granting)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is willing to gaurantee ur happiness at the cost of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence than any sane, rational person of sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellect would not think twice.  This assumes that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to be happy[maiximized utility table]... which I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think is an unreasonable...
</em><br>
<p>I must be failing to follow what you mean by maximizing your
<br>
utility table of something because it still seems to me that
<br>
happiness cannot really be a target that one aims at it is
<br>
a consequence that arise as a desired and hoped for side
<br>
effect of something else one aims at.
<br>
<p>There is a saying &quot;man is the only animal that laughs
<br>
and weeps, because he is the only animal that sees
<br>
what is, and what might have been&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course, assumes that people intuitively seek to maximize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their utilities, and said maximization of utility defines a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state of happiness [which is, I think, reasonable]...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I don't I think its premature at best and problematic at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst. One cannot be happy without a cause. Happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; per se is not persuable. Pleasure is. Lesser levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience are. But I doubt these are what appeal to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; take a look at a little kid sometime :)
</em><br>
<p>Hey I grew up in a catholic family - I've seen the old
<br>
kid of two :-)
<br>
<p>I reckon they are very active little hypothesis testers
<br>
and experimenters. Just because we may look in from
<br>
the outside an think they are &quot;playing&quot; doesn't change
<br>
that they are playing at something. If they are happy
<br>
playing they probably declared they were going out
<br>
to play (something specific) rather than going out to
<br>
be happy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;snip happiness is a sideeffect&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any moral system you build on that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; premise is doomed to fail because it does not take into account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions by that subpopulation of people (antisocial individuals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are operating on a different ethical system).  I would state that ur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumption that there is a propensity to reason is a reasonable one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is necessary for the ability to recognize other autonomous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agents actions for what they are; expressions of their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moral/ethical systems..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Ah I think you missed my point. The potential to persuade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the sociability aspect *is* far stronger when individuals are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and my point is that the all those who are mortal are now becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *aware*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they possess a poor form of wealth and power if it can't extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and health.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; ... and these are the only people you're interested in approaching?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah only all those who are *mortal*  and have a self-interest ;-)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; There is an opportunity there to get them to revisit the social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But these cagey old survivers will not fall for bs. When arguments are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are not in their interest they will not buy into them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; its been my experience that people who are very wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  generally don't  give a shit about social compact.  They got (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  preserve) their wealth at the cost of other individuals...  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agree that you need to put it in terms that involve greed.
</em><br>
<p>Well self interest will do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; So in my view a moral argument cannot be put to a rich or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless it is couched in terms of offering *something* for them. We live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historic period. In this  period it might be possible to promote a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy of more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life for all or more life for none.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; good luck getting the rich to give a shit about the poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (past the ones  making off with their valuables)....
</em><br>
<p>No I'd aim to get the rich to care more effectively for the rich
<br>
by recognizing their relationship with the poor. My emphasis
<br>
is not be charitable to the poor my emphasis is on how would
<br>
you life be better if the poor were not so poor? If they had
<br>
more to loose. If they were able to cooperate with you to make
<br>
both you and them wealthier in absolute terms rather than
<br>
relative terms.
<br>
<p>Would you rather be healthy and active at 130 or have a
<br>
very expensive funeral and a prestigiously looking burinal
<br>
plot at 80?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The alternative may be cabals of the powerful working to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'immortalise' themselves. Such a scenario may restart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;history&quot; whose demise was greatly exaggerated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; probably :) I hope to be part of a successful cabal :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but only if quality of life is high...
</em><br>
<p>Beware the dark side Luke :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Further those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who do not know endeavour to understand themselves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what manner of creature they are, are not going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in a position to know what the most optimal compromises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for them are when compromises need to be made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; I've met several people who are extremely intuitively, but unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to verbalize (form coherent sentences) expressing their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewpoints...they just know what is right for them, and what is not...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how does your system encompass them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; They learn to reason and they learn to use language to persuade.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They learn to understand what they want. This gives them the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best chance to make their way and improve their situation as they go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does not guarantee them success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;omd&gt; and if the overall performance of this new system ends up being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse than their intuitive model? what then?
</em><br>
<p>I have no magic. If my moral code is adopted by others it will because
<br>
they see merit in it. If they see merit in it and I see merit in it I'm
<br>
prepared
<br>
to work on the assumption that their is merit in it. - That a bit simplistic
<br>
but this thread is very long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; The universe in which hard work  gurantees success is not this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one in my view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;omd&gt; work smarter, not harder has always been my motto...
</em><br>
<p>Makes sense. But leveraging your efforts with others can be a
<br>
particularly effective way of working smart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; A person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that deludes themselves that they are a different sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creature with different sets of drivers and needs than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they actually have is precluded from sitting down at table
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to negotiate for their own best interests because they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know their own best interests. A person that deludes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves willingly can hardly be a person that others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would want to engage in a moral compacts with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; according to you :) to me its fine :) In fact, i rather like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space cadets :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It not the space cadets that you have to worry about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Its the wizened old cynics and manipulators that figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that life is a bitch and that they are not going to join the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideological idiocy of submission. These guys have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power to fuck up all your plans and irronically shortchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves in their cynicism too. They are not greedy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough for life (according to this theory). There is a fatal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foolishness in their cynicism. They may be happy to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ten more years of power in the forms that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become accustomed too. They may rate their progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not against what it possible but against how big a differenc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is between them and the common man.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; that is common btw; in people from all walks of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (competition versus a neighbor) versus global competition...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems (given the broadness) that it is inherent to peoples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of views... besides the trick to manipulations is to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to do it urself.
</em><br>
<p>I think your right it comes to us naturally. But what also
<br>
comes naturally to us homo-saps is reasoning. We can
<br>
see that win wins are possible, that it is possible through
<br>
cooperation to do what we cannot do alone. We can
<br>
choose to measure ourselves against what is possible
<br>
rather than against each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The logical consequence of this line of thinking unchecked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the formation of power cabals and starker separations between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; haves and the have nots (in which ironically even the haves will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less than they may have had).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; that assumes there is no such thing as a steady accretion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the hands of a few.  there is no reason to limit it to the life of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person (or collection); you can consider your lineage for instance.
</em><br>
<p>The few will be aware of the condition of the many, and some
<br>
of the few will be uneasy in their relationships with others of
<br>
the few if those others are too harsh or cruel in the treatment
<br>
of the many. We know well enough how easy it is to go from
<br>
in-group to out-group.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Brett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is where I think it becomes important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to acknowledge to oneself that one can be rational and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that one is by nature social. If one does not acknowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that one is social one is not (by my reckoning) being true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to oneself and one does not have the sort of maturity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that will enable one to be on good terms with oneself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and to form real compacts that have a chance of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; honored with others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ooooh I don't know about that :)  You seem to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that people are by nature, social creatures.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessarily think thats the case. Or to qualify, people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are social by a matter of degree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Sure but there is a baseline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; go tell that to the unibomber.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; I would have been happy to point out to the unibomber that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was born social, so much so that he couldn't raise his head to feed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; granted :) but that doesn't really nullify the fact that he did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely antisocial afterwards...
</em><br>
<p>Granted. But there is value in knowing why and how. The value
<br>
is in the power to identify route causes that can be changed.
<br>
Lets go for the disease not the symptom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Then I'd ask him where his sociability ended. It could be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insightful conversation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; probably when he realized it was a losing game for his utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tables...
</em><br>
<p>Or he may discover that he's been shortchanging his own self interest
<br>
with a suboptimal utility table.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Some are quite capable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of going it alone while others would die if seperated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the herd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; None are capable of going it alone yet. But here is the point in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future we may re-engineer ourselves to such an extent that some may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed feel capable of going it alone. And these indivduals will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily be able to be reasoned with with the same starting premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These individuals may become meglomanical persuing as the culmination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their individuality dominance over all else. Because, if you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empathy - why the hell not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; why not indeed?
</em><br>
<p>And therein lies the danger of the future. Rugged immortal individualists
<br>
fighting for supreme godhood in the universe.
<br>
<p>By why not? Seriously. I dunno but I figure god would be bored
<br>
(and lonely) well perhaps not lonely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Only after some initial basic social assistance has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been rendered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; We're dealing with [dynamic] adults here, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You don't intend to limit your morality to only those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are currently social?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nor do I intend to convert the bad eggs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to altruism. I see it as far more useful to persuade the good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eggs that if they do not want war with the bad eggs they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better acknowledge that principle 101 for the bad egg is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely to be what is in this for me. If there is not an answer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that question then conflict will come about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Many infants get suboptimal social assistance and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outcomes are often dysfunctional people. But they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dysfunctional  by choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; but they're still dysfunctional, at least, according to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently  passes for a majority of society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yeah. And society pays the price. A more enlightened society might see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better economies in avoiding the dysfunctional early socialisation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So i question ur assumption that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is social.... Its obviously a core belief in ur system, and certes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; generally speaking, it is the case that most people are social.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Everyone is social to a degree. Am I really saying that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is reachable through their residual sociability. I doubt it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think nature throws up dysfunctional types of all forms and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some genuine sociopaths can probably only be dealt with as amoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; watch some interviews with a sociopath :)  they're really quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascinating...  anyways, there's no reason to render a sociopath a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fact, I'ld say they can be harnassed to detect flaws in current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modes.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I'm saying sociopath when I mean pyschopath.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But not all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; Not all to the same degree. But there is no person alive at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; present (to the best of my knowledge) with the power to stay alive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without cooperating with others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; but you acknowledge that it is a possibility?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; Yes. Imo that is a possibility. For me the interest in morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an interest in politics and in the means by which the possibility may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more become a probability in my life time. Hey I am social, but I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also rational, and I am in this for me :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; I suggest you pick up a microscope and a centrifuge then :)
</em><br>
<p>These works better if you leave them stably sitting on the bench. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;brett&gt; It is not necessary that social be about niceness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is better, more funcitonal, if it is about an enlightened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  understanding of frailty and the benefits of cooperation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  I would argue that tyrants that aim for the short glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  life of Archilles in 2003 are short changing themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  They are sub-optimally selfish. With a tweak of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value  systems they may be able to satisfy more of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needs and desires by  cooperating. But many of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  would have to re-learn and I'd expect few of them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  change what has worked for them if they could not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; presented with a compelling argument. If there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compelling argument that can be made to their self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interest then I would say that no real moral argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  is being put to them at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;me&gt; ....except to say that they have presumeably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; successfuly satisfied their own utility tables....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;brett&gt; No they optimised. But I'd argue they have sold themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They could and may in may cases yet achieve more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;me&gt; perhaps, but they certainly won't be listening... if they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfied,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why change the status quo?
</em><br>
<p>Because they won't stay satisfied. How can you keep up
<br>
with or look down on the Jones if they've gone and
<br>
immortalised themselves?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ----------------------------------- SNIP, wait for part 2 :) damn this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is long :) --------------
</em><br>
<p>Bail at any time or edit with more extreme prejudice. The offer was
<br>
there in the last post.
<br>
<p>Quite seriously, long rambly dialogs are probably
<br>
better offlist. I think it was worth having the discussion
<br>
but maybe not on list.
<br>
<p>Any illuson I had that others might read much of this
<br>
have long past. But the upside is that the dialectic
<br>
process does help sort out thoughts. In this thread
<br>
somewhere are a few gems. They may be distilled
<br>
at a later date maybe.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
