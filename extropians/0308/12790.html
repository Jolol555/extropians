<p><em>&gt; &gt; You get the picture.  There's a *ton* of information about working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conditions (or working restrictions) in the USA during the 19th century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go&gt; &gt; ahead - anybody - defend them if you can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Let me try my hand at defending the indefensible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lots of people are bad. They wouldn't share a surplus even if this meant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others dying. In fact, in the absence of coercion, almost all people are
</em><br>
bad
<br>
<em>&gt; in this way, including you, Olga. Since, as I presume, you have not shared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of your resources not crucial for survival with Sudanese slaves, you
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; bad too. There are people dying out there, but you are not helping them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I am bad as well. The only non-bad person I know, is Eliezer, I think.
</em><br>
<p>Irrelevant to this discussion IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what's wrong with being bad, if everybody is doing it, while preaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for others to be good? Nothing. The word, as applied above, loses its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning. The communal-sharing, or equality-matching relational schemata
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying the reasoning behind the injunction to share surplus and
</em><br>
maintain
<br>
<em>&gt; equality, are ethically meaningless, once you start building ethical
</em><br>
systems
<br>
<em>&gt; using logical means, based directly on volition, rather than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unquestioning carryover of specialized social schemata, which worked well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for survival in the EEA, but now impede progress.
</em><br>
<p>My ethical system begins with Bertrand Russell's quote:  &quot;Remember your
<br>
humanity and forget the rest.&quot;  Then we make progress from that point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Progress is good. Economic progress is good, since it gives humans a
</em><br>
better
<br>
<em>&gt; ability to fulfill their wishes, which is the essence of doing anything at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all. Any vestigial mental quirk, such as tribalism, income-egalitarianism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptance of authority,  that limits economic progress is bad, because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroys the coherence of our goal systems. Incoherent goal systems cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be satisfied. If you covet the richer human's resources, but jealously
</em><br>
guard
<br>
<em>&gt; your own from poorer ones, you will never move forward, and you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere with the progress of others.
</em><br>
<p>Any economic progress is good?  Al Capone's?  Kenneth Lay's?  Dennis
<br>
Kozlowki's?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Economic progress must be maximized, within a coherent, volitionist
</em><br>
ethical
<br>
<em>&gt; framework. This might mean using moral symmetry, Rawlsian reciprocity, and
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; few other heuristics which have been found to aid economic progress, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejecting egalitarianism, tribalism, male/female chauvinism, taboos, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else that interferes with economic growth.
</em><br>
<p>You mention Henry Ford below.  He violated almost every &quot;good&quot; point you are
<br>
making above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is good to be rich. Therefore, anything that interferes with the growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the average sentient's income, is bad. It doesn't matter if you share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with others, or if you hoard. The only thing that matters is how much you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute to the average increase in wealth. Feelings of fairness,
</em><br>
justice,
<br>
<em>&gt; are wrong, if they interfere with the growth of average income of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rawlsian observer.
</em><br>
<p>Fairness and justice are paramount.  &quot;Remember your humanity and forget the
<br>
rest.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All the emotionally rousing images you quoted, for the rational thinker,
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; yet another reason to support economic growth, while maintaining
</em><br>
individual
<br>
<em>&gt; freedom. Henry Ford did more for American children than the nameless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bureaucrats who drafted child labor laws. Once the children's parents
</em><br>
became
<br>
<em>&gt; rich enough, children's labor stopped being a problem. World War II did as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much for women as feminism - once women entered the labor pool, they
</em><br>
learned&gt; that economic competition gives them the power that comes from
<br>
financial&gt; independence.
<br>
<p>Henry Ford didn't do squat that someone else would not eventually have done
<br>
... but without being such an asshole:

<p><a href="http://lisatote.diaryland.com/ford.html">http://lisatote.diaryland.com/ford.html</a>
<br>
<p>Technical progress did more for the Irish than the Irish
<br>
<em>&gt; themselves, and certainly more than the greedy labor unions, which later
</em><br>
all
<br>
<em>&gt; but destroyed  the automobile industry - now most Irish are many times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; richer than the Britons who oppressed them.
</em><br>
<p>I am not against technical progress.  It is simplistic to call labor unions
<br>
&quot;greedy&quot; (why did labor unions start up in the first place?  were they all
<br>
were greedy?  were there any &quot;good&quot; labor unions&quot;  how were working
<br>
conditions before labor unions?).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To point at the misery of the 19th century, and claim that it is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification for laws which, as a side effect, may impede economic
</em><br>
growth,
<br>
<em>&gt; is wrong. *It is not the laws forced by the social progressives that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socially progressive, it was the growth of average incomes that is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source of true progress.* [italics mine]
</em><br>
<p>You say eether and I say eyether, You say neether and I say nyther; Eether,
<br>
eyether, neether, nyther, Let's call the whole thing off! You like potato
<br>
and I like potahto, You like tomato and I like tomahto; Potato, potahto,
<br>
tomato, tomahto!Let's call the whole thing off!
<br>
<p>But oh! If we call the whole thing off, Then we must part. And oh! If we
<br>
ever part, Then that might break my heart! [... Ira Gershwin]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The working conditions of the 19th century were wrong, because most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were then poor, and it is wrong to be poor. Concentrate on creating
</em><br>
wealth,
<br>
<em>&gt; not righting wrongs, and all wrongs will right themselves.
</em><br>
<p>If you lived in the 19th century, is this what you would be telling to half
<br>
of the population in the USA (women), to the (mainly) Chinese laborers who
<br>
built the Transcontinental Railroad, to the slaves, to the children laboring
<br>
in the factories:  &quot;Concentrate on creating wealth, not righting wrongs
<br>
...?&quot;  Is this what you would be telling them?
