On Wed Aug 27, 2003 12:45 Robert J Bradbury warned:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is just warning to list members that the SPAM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation is going to get worse before it gets better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently a distributed denial of service attack has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken out one of the major source points for lists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of systems distributing undesirable emails [1].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/communications/story/0,2000048620,20277794,00.htm">http://www.zdnet.com.au/newstech/communications/story/0,2000048620,20277794,00.htm</a>
<br>
<p>ZDNet confirms:
<br>
&quot;Osirusoft, one of the largest anti-spam black-list, has been shut down 
<br>
by its operator following a barrage of massive Distributed Denial of 
<br>
Service (DoS) attacks that have crippled the service.&quot;
<br>
<p>But there are many people who don't like 'spam blacklists' and never use 
<br>
them. I agree with the opinion that says they are more trouble than they 
<br>
are worth. They are notorious for blacklisting the wrong people. Most 
<br>
people will have had incidents of email lists going missing because they 
<br>
were wrongly blacklisted.
<br>
<p>Bayesian logic and whitelists are much better methods for controlling 
<br>
spam. Getting an industry-wide whitelist, though, is probably 
<br>
impossible. But each user can have their own whitelist to junk all the 
<br>
spam that arrives in their mailbox.
<br>
<p><p>I am not so worried about the spam nuisance as I am about the suspicion 
<br>
that organised crime is behind these virus attacks. See:
<br>
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39115886,00.htm">http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39115886,00.htm</a>

<p>Quote:
<br>
&quot;An antivirus expert claims Sobig is the work not of 'script kiddies', 
<br>
but of sophisticated criminals who want to take control of PCs
<br>
&quot;Sobig smashed all the records in terms of pure numbers, but that's not 
<br>
nearly the whole story,&quot; said Simpson. &quot;This is the sixth in a series of 
<br>
controlled experiments. This isn't about some kiddy writing viruses in 
<br>
his bedroom -- this is really a very sophisticated example of organised 
<br>
crime.&quot;
<br>
<p>Simpson explained that the purpose of getting Sobig onto the computer is 
<br>
not to cause damage or purely to drive wide and rapid spread, but to 
<br>
gain control of machine, by downloading a Trojan and gain access to 
<br>
information such as bank details for the purpose of fraud. Such tactics 
<br>
effectively hand control of the machine over to the virus writer.
<br>
<p>It will also enable unscrupulous marketers to disguise the source of 
<br>
spam by abusing victim's computers and identities.
<br>
End quote
<br>
<p><p>This means that users have to get as serious about protecting their PC 
<br>
as they are about protecting their car and their house.
<br>
Locks, anti-theft systems, alarms, gates, scanners, the whole lot has to 
<br>
be installed and kept up-to-date to keep the thieves out.
<br>
<p><p>Not a very pleasant prospect, really. :(
