</em><br>
<em>&gt; You do not consider a very soft and flexible defintion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;terror&quot; and &quot;aiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and abetting terror&quot; and the wholesale denial of fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights once the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; label is applied (without formal proof) to be a real danger?  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is it not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't consider the government granting itself the power to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our homes with far fewer constraints than ever before and without our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge to be dangerous and against the intent of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution?   You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't consider the possibility of being accused of terror for whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons, stripped of all assets (even including citizenship), detained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indefinitely, without trial or legal counsel to be a real danger?   Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what, pray tell, would you consider dangerous?
</em><br>
<p>I've seen people object to throwing &quot;credential&quot; authority around on the
<br>
list before, but I'm going to play lawyer here -- like I do in a courtroom.
<br>
When someone says a law says something, I (and the judges I practice before)
<br>
demand that I cite to specific language to support that assertion.  Here
<br>
you've made two specific assertions:
<br>
<p>1) applying the label of &quot;terror&quot; and &quot;aiding and abbetting terror&quot; results
<br>
in a &quot;wholesale denial of fundamantal rights&quot; under PA and PAII.  What,
<br>
specifically counts as a &quot;wholesale denial of fundamental rights&quot; under the
<br>
cited statutes?  I'm particularly interested in ways in which *citizens* are
<br>
subject to such a result upon mere application of the cited labels.
<br>
<p>2) Even more seriously, in the last list of horrors you provide, you say
<br>
that someone can be stripped of their citizenship without counsel or trial.
<br>
Again, I'd like to see how the laws you cite work that way.
<br>
<p>Thanks.
