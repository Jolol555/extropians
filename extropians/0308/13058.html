----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Charles Hixson&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We are all still humans.  Espousing TransHumanism doesn't make one a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trans-human.  So don't be surprised that normal human politics it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual reaction pattern even among those who promote other patterns as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferable.  And when the rules are vague and subjective, then those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the decisions will be greatly influenced by their own emotions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will be, not may be.  In that situation there *is* not alternative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I certainly have sympathy with this line of response: there will not be any
<br>
significant improvement until we change our natures. However, transhumanists
<br>
sometimes suggest that even in the absence of changing our nature the
<br>
application of science and technology to our (human) lives will emcipate us
<br>
from at least some extant social ills. I guess to such transhumanists you
<br>
would say: 'not likely'. In any event, what I suggest is an experiment: I
<br>
take it you will bet on the null hypothesis here: the application of
<br>
technology and information about our social natures will do little to change
<br>
the normal course of human politics. You may be right, running the
<br>
experiment would be one way to decide the issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't trust any centralized authority run by people, because over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over again people have proven untrustworthy.  But I do trust traffic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals.  They only play the favorites that they are designed to play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g., emergency vehicles, or timed signals).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTOH, I don't trust voting machines.  Consider the reasons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) how they work is hidden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) there have already been instances where they were appearantly
</em><br>
corrupted.
<br>
<em>&gt; 3) reputable authorities have stated publically that they don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good safeguards against being corrupted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Influencing the vote so that your client wins has a tremendously high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payoff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But do you really think that the prior elections were without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corruption?  Even after the last one, where several different modes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrupting the vote became public knowledge?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Centralized authority is an inherrent weakness when the authority can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit from misusing it's power.  It's an evolutionary process, and if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't consider the likely mutations, you can't predict the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result, but it won't be what you wanted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I understand the relevance of the voting discussion. I'm not
<br>
suggesting that we vote people off the list, I'm suggesting that people
<br>
might change their behavior in response to the signals they get about the
<br>
value of their posts. Think of it as somewhat like a market. We are
<br>
producers of messages and we want as many people to &quot;buy&quot; our messages as
<br>
possible. If I send out messages that have a high perceived noise to signal
<br>
ratio many people will put me in their killfile, so I will have fewer
<br>
&quot;buyers&quot;. I agree about the perennial dangers of centralized authority, and
<br>
while what I am suggesting is not immune from distortion, I also think the
<br>
dangers of corruption are fairly minimal. The public display of the
<br>
killfiles might look like a table with everyone's name on this list (there
<br>
is what about a 1000 people on this list?) on the X and Y axis. I could look
<br>
up your name and see if I am in your killfile and you can look up my name
<br>
and see if I am in your killfile. One conjecture then is that if people can
<br>
signal their dislike of someone's posts by using the killfile this may
<br>
reduce the acrimonious exchanges that sometimes go on. If we are having such
<br>
an exchange I might put you in my killfile and you might retaliate by
<br>
putting me in your killfile--and so would end the exchange. Next to each
<br>
person's name would be the number of people that have entered him or her
<br>
into their killfiles. The conjecture is that people might change their
<br>
behavior so as not to be entered into too many killfiles. Take an extreme
<br>
example. Suppose an individual posts tons of Nazi propaganda to the list
<br>
every day. I conjecture that almost all will enter this person into their
<br>
killfiles, hence the Nazi's voice will go unheard. This Nazi cannot complain
<br>
about a centralized authority squashing her voice since the killfiles are
<br>
set by individuals. As I said, the right to free speech does not entail an
<br>
obligation on others to listen. The reason this system would be relatively
<br>
impervious to corruption is that each person's killfile would be displayed.
<br>
If there was an attempt to discredit someone by artificially raising their
<br>
killfile quotient this could be easily detected because each killfile is
<br>
assignable to a specific individual. If the list managers tried to
<br>
artificially raise your killfile quotient they would have to assign it to
<br>
some individuals, say one of them is me. When I look and see that my
<br>
preferences have been tampered with I will scream bloody blue murder on and
<br>
off the list.
<br>

<br>
