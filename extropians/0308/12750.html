<p><em>&gt; I hope that others are coming around to seeing our nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a jointly owned property around an unwritten contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists. The parties to this contract are the citizens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this nation.  Non citizens are NOT parties to this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular contract.
</em><br>
<p>I have no problem with that, since it's in alignment with
<br>
my instincts, and I can explain my instincts as evolutionarily
<br>
derived and foster the relative success of my group, and
<br>
(for the cultural component thereof) ditto.  In other words, 
<br>
groups which have people in them like us---everything else
<br>
being equal---survive better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In part, the contract holds that the citizens must compete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with each other for whatever benefits are to be had from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizenship.  Non citizens may not compete for the benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of citizenship, unless they &quot;buy in&quot; in a sufficient amount.
</em><br>
<p>Or unless it is deemed safe from a cultural point of view
<br>
to allow them to immigrate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If our hired men (our politicians) subvert this contract, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow others to subvert it, thereby defrauding/robbing/embezzling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the citizens, they should face stiff penalties.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.  Your and my only differences appear to be about
<br>
the actual mechanisms involved, and what the results will be
<br>
of allowing the free market to work.  On the plus side, it's
<br>
a  rule with very few exceptions that everyone is better off 
<br>
when total freedom (up to the usual limits) exists, and that
<br>
definitely includes economic freedom.
<br>
<p>But the &quot;economic freedom&quot; to allow a lot of third-world
<br>
types into your country (e.g., the present Moslem takeover
<br>
of Europe) should not include destroying the culture that
<br>
built your country.  On the other hand, imposing trade
<br>
barriers just because Japanese, say, can build something
<br>
cheaper is a loser in the long run.  You keep up that kind
<br>
of thinking, and the rest of the world eventually leaves
<br>
you in the dust.
<br>
