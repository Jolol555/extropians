<p>
Pardon me for interrupting into what seems to me to be a family squabble.
<br>
As a mortgage broker, I rarely have anything useful to contribute to this
<br>
list. I follow that same interests as many of you, but I can only devote a
<br>
minimal amount of time to the things that I find intersting and wonderful
<br>
about humanity while many of you are experts in your fields.
<br>
I think that I may be in a unique position to contribute this time. This is
<br>
because I don't know anyone on this list. Although I  haven't been around
<br>
long, I read each and every post.
<br>
<p>One thing that I think nearly everyone here will agree with is that
<br>
diversity is a good thing. Both in terms of living organisms, and in human
<br>
society. Without this diversity, things would move forward much slower.
<br>
<p>The largest appeal that this list has to me is the wide range of opinions on
<br>
a wild array of subjects. There are many nrilliant minds here. There are
<br>
people from all walks of life. Somepeople are sensitive, others are harsh.
<br>
Overall, the blend is excellent.
<br>
<p>Some of you have pointed out that the list has rules and that these rules
<br>
need to be followed. Others trump the value of unimpeded free speech. I am
<br>
certain that the best road to follow is somewhere in the middle.
<br>
<p>The expulsion of Mike Lorrey has caused quite a ruckus. It seems to be
<br>
having a cascading affect on the list. As people withdraw, more seem to be
<br>
coming closer to doing so. Many may have already left without the farewell
<br>
letter that Lee Corbin provided. This could very well drastically reduce the
<br>
diversity on this list.
<br>
<p>At the same time, there are people who seem to have a justifiable grudge
<br>
against Mike.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the problem here is how best to protect everyone's
<br>
interest and at the same time, allow for differing opinions.
<br>
<p>The expulsion of Mike Lorrey seems to have been too harsh. What I would
<br>
suggest is a different response to Mike's apparent rude comments. I suggest
<br>
a system of governing rules that provide a few steps between a warning and
<br>
expulsion. It would work like this:
<br>
1.) written warning
<br>
2.) short suspension (2 weeks)
<br>
3.) long suspension (1 month)
<br>
4.) Expulsion (with ability to make amends and ask for a vote to be brought
<br>
back to the list)
<br>
5.) Permanent expulsion
<br>
<p>This would allow for the occasional venting if someone deemed it necessary.
<br>
We would all have to consider the cost-benefit of what we say on this list
<br>
without fearing removal from the list. It would also prevent people from
<br>
engaging in continuous personal attacks.
<br>
<p>Finally, with the ability to appeal the first expulsion decision, it allows
<br>
a person who engages in thistype pf activity to work out their differences
<br>
with the offended party before coming back, and would only allow them back
<br>
if the majority of people felt that this person added value to the list.
<br>
<p>I know this seems simple. I'm not fortunate to have a doctorate or work in
<br>
research. Some ofyou may see my post and assume that I am a &quot;stupid&quot;. But I
<br>
couldn't just sit back and watch such a brilliant group of people act so
<br>
foolishly any longer.
<br>
<p>Let me know what you think. Maybe we can petition for this type of change
<br>
and get some of these people back.
<br>

<em>&gt; <a href="mailto:gregburch@gregburch.net?Subject=Re:%20Lee%20Corbin's%20Goodbye">gregburch@gregburch.net</a> writes: To return to the concept of free speech, I
</em><br>
urge subscribers
<br>
<em>&gt; to consider that ExI is not a government, and the values and rules
</em><br>
regarding
<br>
<em>&gt; governmental regulation of speech donâ€™t necessarily translate into matters
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; private list governance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greg,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I think you have just put your finger on the problem and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowingly shown that you do not understand what is going on.  Let me
</em><br>
attempt to
<br>
<em>&gt; explain it to you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        In accounting and I suppose in law there is a concept of ownership.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you pointed out this list has owners -- no one to my knowledge disputes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        In addition there is the concept of a Stakeholder.  If we think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this as a grocery store there are not only the owners but also
</em><br>
stakeholders such
<br>
<em>&gt; as regular customers, suppliers, etc.  These people have an interest in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; store also.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        We seem to be having a battle between the owners of this list and
</em><br>
some
<br>
<em>&gt; of the stakeholders.  Right now a large group of them seem to be voting
</em><br>
with
<br>
<em>&gt; their feet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Frankly, Mike seems to have been singled out for his specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political opinions.  If you don't agree I suggest you go back and read the
</em><br>
chortling
<br>
<em>&gt; that took place on this list when it was announced he was banned.  Only
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; time read the specifics of what was written
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        On the other hand we have a blessed few on this list from the
</em><br>
idiotic
<br>
<em>&gt; wing of the left wing that are still as welcome as the flowers in spring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Last, if you read the comments Natasha included in email it seems
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; imply that Mike was only the first.  Who wants to live under that kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat?
