<p>Interestingly (as an afterword to the short story version in his collection
<br>
MAPS IN A MIRROR reveals), writing that novel (not story) *preceded* the
<br>
novel ENDER'S GAME. In its development, he came to understand that he
<br>
needed to extend the original tale into a novel that would provide an
<br>
appropriate backstory to SPEAKER. However, he does come close to admitting
<br>
that his moves at the end of the revision/extension were a storytelling
<br>
mistake (because for Card, as a Mormon propagandist writer, the reader is
<br>
always right):
<br>
<p>`..few readers could understand why there were still so many pages left
<br>
when the story was clearly over. Even this flaw didn't bother me. I had a
<br>
Master's degree in English by now, so I knew how to excuse it in literary
<br>
terms. I was making the reader go through the same kind of revision of the
<br>
meaning of the story's past that Ender went through. Ah, how the tools of
<br>
criticism allow us to justify the lapses of our art!' (668).
<br>
<p>I believe that it was *not* a lapse, but an instance of the form of sf
<br>
storytelling known as `cognitive breakthrough' (which encyclopeadist Peter
<br>
Nicholls places near the core of the mode), and I believe that Card himself
<br>
must secretly agree since his current revisionist extension of the Ender
<br>
sequence--which follows Bean and other uber-children--does just this,
<br>
repeatedly (and, alas, rather mechanically if virtuosically by now).
