</em><br>
<p>Nah Robbie, if it makes sense to put horrifying on any sort of
<br>
sliding scale I think there have been some acts in wars that 
<br>
were more completely horrifying than those of the second 
<br>
gulf war and of Afghanistan. The concentration camps in 
<br>
WWII were more horrifying, and more depraved imo. I think 
<br>
it is important to keep our sense of proportion.  
<br>
<p>Bush does not have Hilter's political and media savvy, not by
<br>
a long shot. I very much doubt he has Hitler's degree of single
<br>
minded ruthlessness either. But Hitler came to power in a set
<br>
of circumstances and using a background of propaganda and
<br>
fear that some astute political observers of modern American
<br>
might find provocative. Bush is a bungler, that he has done 
<br>
great harm is because he has great power and poor judgement
<br>
not because he has great malice.
<br>
<p>Imo Bush intended and expected to get UN support for a 
<br>
second resolution. He expected to unearth WMD's. He did not
<br>
have the savvy to differentiate two key issues at the diplomatic
<br>
level and as a consequence he put many in the world offside
<br>
that might have been onside and the UN was wrecked at a time
<br>
when a brighter President might have re-invigorated it. 
<br>
<p>The problem of Iraq and the UN (after resolution 1441 was
<br>
unanimously agreed too) was two problems not one. 
<br>
<p>The second problem was the specific problem of Iraq, the 
<br>
great mistake made was in seeing that as the first problem.
<br>
<p>The first was that the Security Council was the only body 
<br>
with the authority to authorise a go to war decision under
<br>
the special circumstances that prevailed. Yet the Security
<br>
Councils permanent members had no standard in place by
<br>
which any criteria to go to war in the interests of international
<br>
peace and security could be made.  It still has none. Chirac
<br>
was going about saying we will never, never go to war. Such
<br>
a statement made in the context of being specifically asked
<br>
as a permanent security council member for a practical 
<br>
standard would have been patently untenable in the court of 
<br>
world public opinion. And Bush would have been right to 
<br>
threaten to revoke the UN Charter on that basis and to
<br>
actually do it if it came to that. 
<br>
<p>A murder trial even in France must balance the risks between
<br>
sentencing an innocent man and letting a guilty one go free.
<br>
Jury decisions acknowledge this when they are asked to 
<br>
decide guilty or not guilty of murder against a standard, in
<br>
this case against the standard of &quot;beyond reasonable doubt&quot;.
<br>
<p>The UN Security Council including France was obliged 
<br>
under the terms of the Charter to make a judgement in the
<br>
interests of international peace and security and yet Chirac
<br>
of France was able to not decide because Bush did not
<br>
challenge him to come up with a standard of proof for
<br>
any go to war don't go to war to apply both to Iraq and
<br>
for the UN in the future. Had Bush pushed for such a 
<br>
standard and Chirac not come up with one Bush could 
<br>
have argued legitimately that the UN could not function 
<br>
in its current configuration because one of the permanent 
<br>
security council members, France would not agree on a 
<br>
practical standard that balanced the risks in the new world
<br>
that includes terrorist organisations and actions of the scale
<br>
and sophistication of September 11. Bush had the move 
<br>
(if he had the sense to play it to isolate Chirac but he did 
<br>
not play it). 
<br>
<p>Pushed to come up with a standard for UN go to war, 
<br>
no go to war decision Chirac would have had to come up
<br>
with a standard. A practical standard for a practical 
<br>
problem. The standard could have been fair and it could 
<br>
have been rational but in its absence the security council
<br>
cannot perform its task of maintaining international peace
<br>
and security.
<br>
<p>Say the standard that Chirac had come up with was &quot;on 
<br>
the balance of probably risk&quot;. Then the various countries
<br>
could have applied that standard, the risk of a go to war 
<br>
against Iraq, verses the risk of not going on the basis of 
<br>
information available and factoring for urgency. Information
<br>
which could have been provided in camera.  
<br>
<p>Chances are, in hindsight, with such a standard, that the 
<br>
US would not have been able to make its case for a quick
<br>
invasion as it didn't have evidence of weapons of mass 
<br>
destruction. But had there been such evidence then the case
<br>
should have been able to be quickly. And the UN would
<br>
have had a working standard for dealing with Iran and 
<br>
North Korea and other rogue states.
<br>
<p>Imo history provided a moment to a US President to put 
<br>
real teeth in international law, and to give the UN, in the 
<br>
interests of the US as well, real power. But through poor
<br>
diplomacy Bush blue it. He missed the shot. No other 
<br>
national leader was in a position to call for a standard
<br>
because Bush was controlling the clock, he had the military
<br>
in place and he was setting the timetable. He got the UN
<br>
to resolution 1441 and that is too his credit.
<br>
<p>Only Bush could make the UN better, or if need be break
<br>
it in good faith in front of all the world because the French
<br>
or some other permanent member were being hopelessly 
<br>
intractable in refusing to even come up with a standard. 
<br>
<p>Of all the options Bush could have chosen he chose the
<br>
absolute worst. He chose to keep the UN but breach 
<br>
the charter. And international law has been in a state of 
<br>
conspicuous farce ever since. Bush has the US in the
<br>
situation where it appears to respect international law only
<br>
when it suits it. And the world knows this. America 
<br>
historically has been better than that.  The world looks at
<br>
the mighty US military and thinks potential or actual
<br>
&quot;protection racket&quot;. 
<br>
<p>The reason that Iraq was not worth the price was that
<br>
the price was America's word in international law and
<br>
the final reduction of the UN to a farce by one man. 
<br>
President G. W. Bush. America still needs the UN but it
<br>
cannot imbue that body now with legitimacy as President 
<br>
Bush through diplomatic incompetence (not malice imo -
<br>
he did too many other things that make malice or deep 
<br>
planning a plausible explanation) took the principle role
<br>
in destroying it. It continues to exist now as a facade, that
<br>
few will dare to speak of burying but the logic of its charter,
<br>
the trust that nations especially permanent security council
<br>
members will abide by the Charter has been rent.
