<p>
This post will sound harsh but fair; I think it's the best way to show you
<br>
all my appreciation.
<br>
<p>I think this community can be percieved negatively because of that &quot;having
<br>
visions that are shocking to the social consensus&quot; thing; these visions
<br>
being at the fringe of conjectures and actual trends, it can be frustrating
<br>
for people who don't want to miss on the evolutionary advantages this tribe
<br>
might have yet don't want to bet on duds.
<br>
This situation saddens me because I find myself &quot;shot by both sides&quot; :
<br>
extropianism and the majority of people are either at best lacking the
<br>
historical culture to know these ideas are old hat or at worst voluntarly
<br>
omitting this knowledge by sheer vanity.
<br>
<p>The visions and methodology of Extropianism hardly makes it a new
<br>
philosophy.
<br>
<p>Charles Fourier, great historian of the future, philosopher of glorious
<br>
musical tomorrows of harmonious bodies, way after civilizations, when the
<br>
flesh will be invested of ideal qualities , who was appreciated by Marx and
<br>
Engels, was proposing an harmonian revolution.
<br>
Here's some traduction of passages from Oeuvre complètes tome VIII and
<br>
Bulletin de Lyon, 1804:
<br>
&quot;humanity will wake itself to the materialist ameliorations it's body is
<br>
suceptible to.&quot;
<br>
He was forecasting living on other planets since at this point the earth
<br>
would be too small.
<br>
&quot;New and useful properties gained by earthlings living in these new celestal
<br>
countries: amphiby, night vision, perpetual growth of hairs and teeths,
<br>
indolorism , whitening to the sun etc&quot;
<br>
Forecasting genetic manipulations:
<br>
&quot;from their torso a new appendice would grow: used either as a powerful
<br>
weapon, to prevent falls, a superb ornament with infinite force and
<br>
dexterity. Habitants of suns, lactées and ringed planets like saturn are
<br>
amphibious, by the effect of an ouverture in the casing of their heart, and
<br>
have a fifth member common to both sex: the archiarm who can kill an animal
<br>
in one shot, be used as a whirling parachute, a motor for fake wings, a rope
<br>
ladder, a swim-aid that gives man the velocity of a fish and thousand ohter
<br>
possibilities either on earth or in the seas. The archiarm triples
<br>
productivity of the industry and bring the body at it's ultimate degree of
<br>
biological perfection.&quot;
<br>
<p>(He too, as I said in another post, could be a promoter of impossible
<br>
bodies, but that's another story...)
<br>
<p>That ought to be enough for the vision part. A bit frivolous and funny but
<br>
not much more than saying that in the future our children will be few and
<br>
immensely valued, huanity will have to deal with hypermaturity  etc.
<br>
<p>On the methodological front, I present you Condorcet who concludes his
<br>
_Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain_  by
<br>
predicting the end of stupidity, hypocrisy and the emergence of a new body
<br>
made possible by technological, scientific and medical progress.
<br>
Sounds cutting edge? It was written in 1795.
<br>
&nbsp;Death is percieved as a hypothesis to be reserved to exceptional cases like
<br>
accidents or rare probabilities. The lenght of life, considerably augmented
<br>
&quot;get close to for ever (...) an unlimited lenght&quot;.
<br>
So it is : a body who escaped the laws of nature and entropy ...
<br>
<p>Genuine ignorance or vanity, it doesn't matter to me: as a group,
<br>
extropians/transhumanists are a bit too eager to misread their predecesor in
<br>
order to make room for themselves...
<br>
Also, using the structure of an &quot;institute&quot; / &quot;school of philosophy&quot; is a
<br>
massive philosophical regression, sad, a system of terror, with the
<br>
pretention of making something new but is a king-sized povrety.
<br>
&nbsp;I think we have great dreams but extropians don't go at it the right way.
<br>
Don't even think of calling Fourier and Condorcet  proto extropians, please,
<br>
that would be disingenious for the other way around woud be more logical
<br>
since they are already accepted in the academic network, humanity's common
<br>
cultural heritage and they had more historical influence than their current
<br>
poor unsuccessful incarnation: extropianism is just a materialism and
<br>
realizing it by droping the usless brand name would be the mature thing to
<br>
do for it would help in getting credibility and real life traction to our
<br>
common dreams.
<br>
Rejoice! You are not an extropian, you are a materialist ! :-)
<br>
You are part of a tradition and your ideas are accepted more easily.
<br>
Do I think this post will change anything to the established order?  I know
<br>
people who are branded extropians or transhumanists won't budge, I wrote
<br>
this for people  who will get interested in these problems of our time, so
<br>
they won't needlessly cripple their game.
<br>
May our dreams be reality!
<br>
