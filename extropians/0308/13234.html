I would suggest that a smaller lever is sufficient if you don't buy that you  
<br>
have to move great masses of humans to support your cause in order for it to  
<br>
happen.  A smaller lever might require for a fulcrum being able to work       
<br>
outside what the masses of humanity understand, know about or have            
<br>
sanctioned.                                                                   
<br>
<p>I agree, and this is how science often is done nowadays. However, this is
<br>
not foolproof-- as the stem cell story, the banning of human cloning, the
<br>
crippling limitations on animal use in research, and the recent demise of the
<br>
DARPA futures market demonstrate.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Another worthy fulcrum is escape from heavy taxation and deep government     
<br>
monitoring of gathering capital and resources.                                
<br>
<p><p>I'm always on the lookout for ways to do this. Although, truth be told,
<br>
research in many fields is very, very expensive... so expensive as to put
<br>
funding out of reach of most individuals and into the realm of corporations
<br>
and governments. Even the few individuals rich enough to personally fund a
<br>
typical program project grant are not themselves scientists-- to get that
<br>
rich, they have to have specialized in making money from the beginning. As for
<br>
corporations, they are under constant pressure to deliver short-term profits,
<br>
and this is a disincentive to blue-sky research with high/unknown risks and
<br>
high/unknown payoffs. Furthermore, corporations face a free-rider problem from
<br>
competitors if they publicize the results of their research, yet without open
<br>
publication there is massive duplication of effort and the overall rate of
<br>
progress slows down. This may change as the lifespan and wisdom of investors
<br>
increases... but for the time being, what we're left with is government as the
<br>
main patron for many types of basic research.
<br>
<p>I regard this as a major problem Libertarians have yet to offer a solution to
<br>
other than assurances that it simply won't happen once government gets off
<br>
everybody's back. Sort of a Friendly Market argument.
<br>
<p>I do have some thoughts on how to maximize political leverage given the
<br>
short-term inevitability of government dependence, but am thinking about how
<br>
to phrase it so that it doesn't get used against us should people from the
<br>
list start taking this approach (remember, every single thing you say here is
<br>
placed in a publicly accessible archive on extropy.org). Private queries from
<br>
individuals interested in discussing this in the meantime are welcome.
