<p>This reminds me of a question posed by maternal grandfather
<br>
(not for the first time I'm sure) and despite being a theist so far
<br>
as I could tell.
<br>
<p>If God can do anything can God make a rock so heavy he
<br>
cannot lift it.
<br>
<p>A bit glib in a way but it gets at the essential contingent nature
<br>
of the world as we experience it. What is light without dark.
<br>
Pleasure without pain. Victory without struggle. Heroism and
<br>
nobility without the freedom to fall short of such.
<br>
<p>One could refrase as Damien S does, that indeed if google can
<br>
be broken, google is (by most notions) not god.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aha, so google is a Meta-God.  Given how &quot;broken&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current  reality is (people starving, global warming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oil spills, yada, yada, yada) clearly it is not perfect.
</em><br>
<p>Not so Robert. Not if we are to engage sportfully in the the weaving
<br>
of economical plausible myth, a passtime that I'd hold has been
<br>
a rationalising function since time immemorium.
<br>
<p>The theist does not need to posit many worlds merely two. On in
<br>
which all that appears nasty and petty in this one (merely half of the
<br>
whole) stands as a challenge to heroism and nobility of character
<br>
in its participants. It is not, so far as can see that suffering and
<br>
hardship cannot be part of a best of all possible world it is only that
<br>
these things cannot be mitigated. Simply posit as some religions do
<br>
that there is an acounting at the end of ones life and that justistice is
<br>
metered out before one is usured into the alternate half of the universe
<br>
with appropriate karmic adjustments for good and bad performance
<br>
and you have a system (it seems to me) where all suffering and struggle
<br>
can be a means of elevating and promoting that which is good and
<br>
noble within us. This world alone cannot be the best of all possible
<br>
worlds, but this world plus just one other, not multiple others would
<br>
seem to permit a situatiuon where karma can carry across the two
<br>
worlds and real heroism and nobility can exist perhaps precisely
<br>
because we cannot know that justice is done in the one necessary
<br>
other world. Yet justice *could* be done in that one other world.
<br>
<p>Just a simple playful musing, from an amateur mixer and melder of
<br>
myths. But one in which all things including evil things in part of a
<br>
world could be seen as good to god if they stimulated complexity and
<br>
if all pain is mitigated in this world is mitigated or justified in that
<br>
other
<br>
world and is part of the necessary challenges of this one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And all that stuff  about the apple and falling from grace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- that is just a rationalization from when we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely clueless as to what might really be going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So clearly its an experiment to discover the one perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  future (just like Trance says in Andromeda).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, GOOGLE, is not a god -- *YET*.  But anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows the contents of 3,307,998,701 web pages is pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darn close in my book.
</em><br>
<p>Ah Robert, I think, you give too much credit too easily :-).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder if the tipping point is when Google becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more perfect  than reality?
</em><br>
<p>Now theres some terms &quot;perfect&quot; and &quot;reality&quot; begging some
<br>
definintion :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if anyone saw the Tonight show rerun last night with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jay Leno  interviewing two young people regarding some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably common facts (that they were clueless about)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tipping point is far far closer than most people on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  list would suspect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forrest didn't have it quite right.  Instead of &quot;Stupid is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid does&quot;, it should instead be &quot;Stupid is as stupid is&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't see the show so ya lost me in the last bit about the
<br>
&quot;tipping point&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;Stupid is as stupid is&quot; *is* pretty hard to argue with ;-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
