<p>I agree with this general theory. I also wonder if it does not affect

poor maternal diet is why.

<em>&gt;In a study that shows more than ever you are what you eat, scientists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said on Friday they had changed the coat colors of baby mice simply by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altering their mothers' diets. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Basically what they show is that by giving vitamins the expression of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the agouit gene is turned down. Maternal diet also affects other gene 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expression, which is interesting. I may have mentioned earlier that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maternal choline appears to improve spatial memory in mice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This opens up an interesting issue (and a rhetorical &quot;trick&quot;): is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceptable for mothers to tailor their diets to help or affect their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;child? Many of the standard anti-genetic arguments seem to say no, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would imply that mothers should not be allowed to deliberately eat food
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rich in (say) choline, which makes for a good rhetorical reductio ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;absurdum. But if we accept that mothers may eat chocolate (rich in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lecithine, which turns into choline) to improve their children but not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any genetic interventions, what is the fundamental difference? Is it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just gene expression changes that are OK? Again, it seems nature is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obliging us with any other answer than that a lot of effects during 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early development can affect the child profoundly; what we do with them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and how we handle them ethically is up to us. There are no ready-made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boundaries.
