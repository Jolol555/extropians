The following is a straight excerpt from Robert Ettinger
<br>
on the cryonics list.
<br>
<p>The bottom paragraph on how to help seems worth the
<br>
repost.

Subject: Michigan issues
<br>
<p>The Cryonics Institute is surprised and disappointed by the
<br>
orders issued by the Michigan Department of Consumer
<br>
and Industry Services, which it believes are completely
<br>
unjustified.Since we have had the orders for only 24 hours,
<br>
we are still considering the precise courses of action that 
<br>
we will take, including whether to proceed with litigation. 
<br>
However, the Department's orders, which prohibit certain
<br>
activities pending resolution of the licensing issues raised
<br>
by the Department, do not in any way affect the care of
<br>
our current patients. Moreover, while we strongly disagree
<br>
with the Department's actions, we note that the Department
<br>
has stated that it does not wish to prohibit our activities, but
<br>
desires that they continue under the Department's licensing 
<br>
process.While resolution of these issues  proceeds, CI will
<br>
continue to protect the interests of its members. We will
<br>
promptly keep you apprised  as to further developments. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In the event of litigation, we would welcome support in the
<br>
form of affidavits from cryonicists with academic credentials
<br>
as well as any CI members. Please contact David Ettinger
