<p>I'm not so sure.  Dole doesn't buy land in Nebraska because one generally
<br>
cannot grow pinapples there.  The land they own in Hawaii may be enough
<br>
simply due to constraints on how many pinapples one can market.  Refer back
<br>
to the conversation with comments by Damien and others regarding tariffs on
<br>
agricultural products.  Even if you owned the land in a lower cost producing
<br>
&quot;state&quot; one might not be able to sell the products (so it makes no sense to
<br>
own the land).  If this argument held together people would be snapping up land
<br>
in northern Canada and Russia and using genetic engineering to produce crops
<br>
that would grow there.  Or one would see massive efforts to build desalination
<br>
plants and pipelines to supply the U.S. southweast with fresh water.  And
<br>
of course there is North Africa and the Mid-east.  Yet one doesn't see
<br>
efforts of that nature.
<br>
<p>Instead one sees a greater concentration of &quot;wealth&quot; in the hands of those
<br>
who own the &quot;Intellectual Property&quot; and &quot;human resources&quot;, e.g. IBM, Intel,
<br>
etc.  But one only owns the IP for 20 years and the human resources are
<br>
generally free to move about.
<br>
<p>The &quot;land&quot; is ultimately important if we get into a massive population
<br>
growth situation (say a world population of 20-100 billion).  But there
<br>
are solutions to this -- from more efficient agricultural methods (see
<br>
Mark Walker's recent post) to solar power satellites.
<br>
<p>It is relatively accepted by economic theorists that as &quot;natural resources&quot;
<br>
are exhausted that substitutions occur.  I have not looked at the web site, but
<br>
if it does not examine (in detail) substitution phenomena, then it doesn't
<br>
have a grasp of the &quot;big picture&quot;.
