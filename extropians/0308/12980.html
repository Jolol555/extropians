<p>UCF brain cell research spawns hope for longer life
<br>
<p>University of Central Florida researchers find that
<br>
nanomaterials developed for industry triple or
<br>
quadruple life of brain cells
<br>
ORLANDO, Aug. 13, 2003 -- A molecular biologist and a
<br>
nanoscientist at the University of Central Florida
<br>
have found that nanomaterials developed for industry
<br>
have an unexpected and potentially revolutionary side
<br>
effect: They can triple or quadruple the life of brain
<br>
cells. 
<br>
The result is people could live longer and with fewer
<br>
age-related health problems. 
<br>
<p>Beverly Rzigalinski, assistant professor in the
<br>
Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology and
<br>
at the Biomolecular Sciences Center, and Sudipta Seal,
<br>
associate engineering professor at the Advanced
<br>
Materials Processing and Analysis Center and the
<br>
Department of Mechanical, Materials and Aerospace
<br>
Engineering, will receive $1.4 million from the
<br>
National Institutes of Health, National Institute on
<br>
Aging to study the reasons behind the reaction and
<br>
possible future applications. 
<br>
<p>Rzigalinski has spent the bulk of her career on
<br>
NIH-funded research from the National Institute of
<br>
Neurological Disorders and Stroke studying how brain
<br>
cells &quot;talk&quot; to each other, most recently focusing on
<br>
microglia -- a specialized cell that responds to brain
<br>
injury and initiates the response to either repair or
<br>
destroy the damaged neuron. Seal creates nanostructure
<br>
materials and recently developed a process for
<br>
engineering particles on a nanoscale -- so they might
<br>
have more efficient industrial applications. 
<br>
<p>Because of the current flurry of publicity that
<br>
anti-oxidants have received for their potential
<br>
anti-aging properties, Rzigalinski decided to explore
<br>
introducing the miniaturized particles to the brain
<br>
cells of rats. 
<br>
<p>&quot;In culture, rat brain cells usually live about three
<br>
weeks,&quot; Rzigalinski said. &quot;The cells exposed to the
<br>
engineered nanoparticles lived three to four times
<br>
longer.&quot; 
<br>
<p>To confirm the results, Rzigalinski, the grant's
<br>
principal investigator, repeated the process multiple
<br>
times and found that cells exposed to a single dose of
<br>
engineered nano-oxide particles routinely outlived the
<br>
untreated cells by three- to four-fold, with the
<br>
longest living cell lasting 123 days. 
<br>
<p>Rzigalinski then explored the quality of the aged
<br>
neurons and found they were signaling or &quot;talking&quot; to
<br>
each other in the same manner as their youthful
<br>
counterparts. &quot;This shows there is a potential not
<br>
just to extend the life span but to preserve
<br>
function,&quot; she said. 
<br>
<p>Seal has worked on developing oxide particles for high
<br>
temperature production since his undergraduate days in
<br>
the late 1980s. In 2000, as he took over the
<br>
coordination of UCF's nanotechnology initiative, he
<br>
and a student developed ultrafine nano-sized powders
<br>
and solutions. The particles, less than 10 nanometers
<br>
(about 30 atoms) in size, not only offered a more
<br>
efficient coating for use in machines but also opened
<br>
the door for biological studies in collaboration with
<br>
Rzigalinski. 
<br>
<p>When a university research administrator aware of the
<br>
work of each scientist introduced the two, the
<br>
possibilities immediately began forming. &quot;This type of
<br>
cross-disciplinary partnership is what we dream
<br>
about,&quot; said Pallavoor Vaidyanathan, assistant vice
<br>
president for research. It is also critical to forging
<br>
frontiers in nanoscience. 
<br>
<p>Research in the medical profession suggests that a
<br>
major component of aging is free radical damage to
<br>
cells. Free radical scavengers, often taken in the
<br>
form of vitamins, can counter the damage to a very
<br>
limited degree. A regenerative nanoparticle, such as
<br>
the one developed by Rzigalinski and Seal, offers
<br>
promise of negating those problems and could be
<br>
helpful in treatment of certain age-related disorders
<br>
-- such as Alzheimer's disease -- as well as arthritis
<br>
and other joint-related problems, Rzigalinski says. 
<br>
<p>Most recently, the Rzigalinski lab has found that the
<br>
nanoparticles have potent anti-inflammatory
<br>
properties. The investigators plan to explore the
<br>
possibility of creating a coating from the particles
<br>
that could be used for vascular and orthopedic
<br>
implants, stents and other devices that are prone to
<br>
inflammatory reactions. 
<br>
<p>Initial tests show that the nanoparticle anti-oxidants
<br>
regenerate once they penetrate the cell -- meaning one
<br>
dose could conceivably continue its therapeutic
<br>
effects indefinitely. 
<br>
<p>Rzigalinski introduced the collaboration to her
<br>
colleagues at the NATURE biotechnology symposium in
<br>
Miami earlier this year. She has also submitted an
<br>
abstract on the project to the National and
<br>
International Neurotrauma Symposium, and Society for
<br>
Neuroscience. 
<br>
<p>Nanotechnology is considered the new frontier of
<br>
science, and it could revolutionize modern medicine in
<br>
the future. The potential for creating new materials
<br>
at a size capable of being absorbed by human cells
<br>
calls for a new type of scientist -- one who can
<br>
collaborate across seemingly unrelated disciplines.
<br>
Combining the fields of biomolecular science with
<br>
engineering offers a significant step in that
<br>
direction. 
<br>
<p>Pappachan Kolattukudy, director of UCF's Biomolecular
<br>
Science Center and a consultant on the project, said
<br>
the collaboration is part of a strategy that UCF is
<br>
going to be using increasingly in building its
<br>
presence in the biomolecular sciences. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We are concentrating on building interfaces between
<br>
areas in which we have strengths,&quot; Kolattukudy said. 
<br>
<p>Vimal Desai, director of AMPAC, said that
<br>
nanomaterials are currently considered highly
<br>
strategic for important applications ranging from
<br>
homeland security to just plain good health. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It is so good to be able to build bridges for an
<br>
interdisciplinary effort through competent and dynamic
<br>
researchers at UCF,&quot; Desai said. 
<br>
<p>###
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
