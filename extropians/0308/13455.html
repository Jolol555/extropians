<p>
Barbara, I have a lot of respect for your opinion, but I'd like to raise a
<br>
few points in response.
<br>
<p>In connection with the first case, two comments.  First, presumably there
<br>
*was* a warrant issued by a court.  Did the CPA take the warrant to the
<br>
lawyer he consulted?  Did you see it? The second comment takes a little
<br>
explaining, but I can best illustrate it with a crack a federal judge made
<br>
in one of my cases.  One party was complaining about the actions of the
<br>
equivalent of FBI agents in the country of which my client was a native in
<br>
questioning some of my opponent's witnesses about an unrelated matter
<br>
(claiming, with no evidence, that acts of the state security police had been
<br>
instigated by my client).  Rejecting this, the judge said &quot;That's what
<br>
police do -- they're always sticking their noses into places they don't
<br>
belong.&quot;  My point?  Liberty isn't self-executing and never will be.  If he
<br>
felt it wasn't justified, how active was the CPA in challenging the
<br>
investigation?  Police forces are *always* going to bump up against the
<br>
boundaries of their legal authority, even when they have only good motives.
<br>
It takes some push back *in individual cases* to keep them in line.  No
<br>
amount of legislation can make up for that -- although doctrines like
<br>
Miranda and &quot;fruit of the forbidden tree&quot; can help.
<br>
<p>My second point is to ask whether the specific items you mention at the end
<br>
of your post are from the current law or the so-called &quot;Patriot Act II.&quot;
<br>
The latter is a dead letter politically, as far as I'm concerned.  It'll
<br>
never get out of committee.
<br>
<p>Finally, as I've said before and as you well know, Barbara, the machinery of
<br>
the legal system runs at its own pace, and people can become impatient while
<br>
that machinery does its work.  Challenges to actions under the enacted
<br>
Patriot Act are working their way up through the courts (I note that the
<br>
ACLU only filed their first, tentative challenge to core elements of it this
<br>
summer, nearly two years after it was passed).  But that's how law works --
<br>
it is only related to but isn't the same as politics, which works on a much
<br>
shorter time scale.  It takes time.  And I don't see any indication that the
<br>
courts won't enforce the Constitution when push comes to shove -- just look
<br>
at the recent shenanigans in Alabama (Nehemiah Scudder to the contrary,
<br>
Damien :-)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  What,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically counts as a &quot;wholesale denial of fundamental rights&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cited statutes?  I'm particularly interested in ways in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *citizens* are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subject to such a result upon mere application of the cited labels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't answer the question exactly as asked, because I don't know what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant by &quot;wholesale denial of fundamental rights.&quot; But I can tell you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of the PA's that disturb me. I'll start with a specific incident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that occurred around three months ago. A certain CPA was informed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the FBI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he must turn over all the papers he held relating to one of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clients, and that he would be in violation of the law if he informed his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; client that the papers had been taken. The CPA, shocked at being told he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not inform his client what had happened, called his own lawyer. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawyer himself had never heard of any such law. I had read the PA and told
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lawyer that, yes, amazingly enough, under this law the FBI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could seize a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's papers without ever informing the owner of the papers and could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even prevent the custodian of the papers from telling the owner. The owner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the papers bore no resemblance to a terrorist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra was quoted in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington Post as saying &quot;We would use whatever tools are available to us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prosecute violations of any law,&quot; in the context of discussing the PA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the wording of the PA is such that it could be used against just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says: &quot;The right of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affirmation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be seized.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you look at British common law from the 1600's on, and at U.S. case law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the 4th Amendment, it's clear that secret &quot;fishing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expeditions&quot; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort that are being conducted under the PA are exactly the sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government behavior the 4th Amendment was meant to protect people from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are some of the other provisions of the PA's that could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ends:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --People can be detained in prison without charged with a crime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being allowed access to a lawyer and obviously, with no trial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Bank accounts can be frozen without a court order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Information can be obtained about subscribers from ISP's, libraries, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stores.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Phone conversations can be monitored without a court order.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These broad powers invite fishing expeditions and invasion of privacy. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather sensitive about this, since my own property was invaded by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police, without a warrant, under the direction of the BATF -- because BATF
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents flying over my land in a helicopter saw a Vitex tree growing on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land and mistook it for marijuana. A very nervous young man held me at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gunpoint and could easily have made a mistake and blown me or my daughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away. We did not even remotely fit the profile of &quot;drug dealer&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or &quot;grower&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or any other sort of criminal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Lord Acton wrote in 1887, 'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrupts absolutely.' When there are laws on the books that give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tremendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power to one group of people over another, the power will surely be abused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in at least some cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether such abuses of power will be helpful enough in preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks to be worth the price is another question. I think not,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I see how laws that existed before the PA's were not and are not used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively. Based on the history I've read, I would predict that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary person will still be in about the same amount of danger of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorist attacks as he or she was before the PA's but will now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in danger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of acts by overzealous police as well.
