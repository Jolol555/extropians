Cryofan quoted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;What happened to the Extropians, those space-bound,
<br>
cryogenics-obsessed children of Ayn Rand and the WELL, after the WIRED
<br>
Long Boom came crashing down? Well, they've swallowed their
<br>
anti-statist convictions and mutated into Strangelovian
<br>
*****neo-conservative think-tanks*****, which have the ear of the
<br>
President and were behind things such as the aborted terrorism futures
<br>
market. Or so Andrew &quot;blogs are killing Google&quot; Orlowski says anyway&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I am guessing, my dear Cryofan, that the Neocons have the prez's ear to a 
<br>
point. Where does that end? Saudi Arabia and its rulling family and the Wahabbi 
<br>
sect. To be fair to the prez, this has been a condition for decades. In other 
<br>
words, Buba Clinton and the US state dept would have the identical policy. Just 
<br>
like Billy Clinton, we have no energy policy; same non-policy, different 
<br>
administration. Its mideast oil or nothing, even if its Iraqi oil, which ain't 
<br>
exactly flowing like milk and superfluid honey.
<br>
<p>Neocons are, in my opinion, essential pragmatists who like aspects of the 
<br>
status quo. I am guessing that this would also include former prez, buba Clinton; 
<br>
who enjoyed his joggings and visits to McDonalds, and daliances with your 
<br>
occasional bimbettes (or is that bub-ettes?) When the &quot;future&quot; doesn't happen 
<br>
(space flights to mars, nanotech saving the world by 2001), naturally, there is a 
<br>
drop-off in interest in such phenomena. Such  technical developments may 
<br>
indeed occur but ain't gonna happen for decades, centuries, or milenia. Hey, if we 
<br>
&nbsp;ain't having a Jetsons future; theres always those Trek-ventions. :-D
