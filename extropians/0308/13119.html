<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, how would you approach this topic when speaking to a

</em><br>
<p>Well, first one has to acknowledge that &quot;living forever&quot; may not
<br>
*the* most important thing.  Particularly if it turns out we cannot
<br>
get out of, or shift, the laws of this universe and protons &amp; neutrons
<br>
do indeed decay.  Then all bets are off.
<br>
<p>So one seeks a life perhaps of &quot;relative values&quot;.  I would say that
<br>
one might consider three possible motivations:
<br>
<p>a) Reproduction.  This is the one most species terrestrial or alien
<br>
are probably programmed with.  It is essential for a non-directed
<br>
evolution and complexification of the universe (see (c)).
<br>
<p>b) Fun.  This gets into Eliezer's &quot;Fun Theory&quot;.  How do you maximize
<br>
the amount of fun you can have in life for however long you are alive?
<br>
[For me this seems to require that I reinvent myself from time to time.]
<br>
<p>c) Complexification.  This is in line with the Extropy Institute's
<br>
principles and the desirability of defeating entroy to the greatest
<br>
degree that one can.  It is perhaps an &quot;artistic&quot; creation (or expression)
<br>
of advanced technological civilizations.  Conscious (directed) evolution
<br>
may be able to trump natural (undirected) evolution [e.g. (a)].
<br>
<p>I don't know about others, but if I knew the Universe were going to
<br>
ultimately trump me -- I'd be placing a very high emphasis on (b) and
<br>
(c) just to be able to say &quot;neener, neener, neener&quot; to the Universe.
<br>
<p>The reason that life extension is good is that it would seem
<br>
to provide for greater opportunities for (a/b/c) [with some limits
<br>
perhaps on (a)].
<br>
<p>Others might provide additional interesting perspectives -- I would
<br>
doubt that my list is complete.  For example, &quot;curiosity&quot; might be
<br>
added to the list.  I know that things that motivate me include
<br>
what the 4 probes heading for Mars will discover?, what will Cassini
<br>
discover?, what *really* are the defects that cause aging?, whether
<br>
we will really one day construct a space elevator?, whether we can
<br>
construct an inside-out MBrain that finally figures out the &quot;meaning
<br>
of life&quot; as it hurls itself into a Black Hole?, etc.  Or one could
<br>
simplify things, e.g. Why would one *not* want learn to play every
<br>
musical instrument?  Why would one *not* want to master every known
<br>
sport? etc.
<br>
<p>I'll close with citing the very first quote (by Heinlein) from my
<br>
quote collection [1].
