I wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I will have to give it some thought as to whether the &quot;complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; openness&quot; principle that I was speaking in favor of should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this inclusive.  What do you think, (perhaps in a few years I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; need not ask!)
</em><br>
<p>and Rafal responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ### Thought transparency - yes. Involuntary thought control, whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surreptitious or open - no.
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps the only reason (there is at least one) to 
<br>
oppose complete transparency---including that one's thoughts
<br>
are public---is courtesy and politeness.  These evolved
<br>
refinements are so far *crucial* for people getting along
<br>
(e.g., the slow realization on this list that Crocker's Rules
<br>
don't work out very well).  Complete transparency might be
<br>
extremely problematic.
<br>
<p>But Samantha does not like the whole idea AT ALL:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I cannot believe what I am reading here.  Does anyone remember that the vast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of human beings on this planet do not think at all like we do and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would consider many of our thoughts, much less acting on any of them, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely and even pathologically dangerous?
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so what do I care if they think our thoughts are dangerous
<br>
and pathological?  They can already sip at this list and get a
<br>
taste.  So what.  Remember: it's the ability to *do* something
<br>
to someone else that is dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What exactly are we counting on to still have any room to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect extropian change at all when everyone and anyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only examine all our actions but all of our thoughts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well?  
</em><br>
<p>Just what are we afraid of?  Just what do we have to hide?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are we expecting the vast majority to somehow become enlightened and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerant?    If not, then exactly what kind of game are we playing?   As I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see it the ability to see everything, including thought would result in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst kind of dystopia given the current nature of human beings and our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions.   If you see some good airtight reason this would not be so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then please share it.
</em><br>
<p>Okay: I am sure that the more they learn about us (or, in the
<br>
broader context of your question, the more that other parts of
<br>
the world learn about the West), the better.  Openness rules.
<br>
