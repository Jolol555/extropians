Responding to Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Genocide sucks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the sort of dumb phrase that does *not* advance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.  Worse, had you not just written a clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and eloquent (even if overstated in a couple of places)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational analysis, then one would conclude from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound bite that perhaps such rational analysis was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ready to hand, or perhaps not even possible.
</em><br>
<p>My point was that the idea is so useless that we really need not consider
<br>
it, or at least can put it right down near the bottom of a prioritised list
<br>
of things to ponder. I also think that football sucks and is useless, and
<br>
relegate it to the same scrap heap of dumb ideas that I don't need.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We have the whole space of wonderful, complex extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ideas to play in; can we drop this moronic crap?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I simply do not understand is how threatened you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sound and feel.  We *do* have convincing and thoughtful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments rejecting a great many bad things, and we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not feel put upon to demonstrate from time to time.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some doubter may ask over and over why evolution works,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it would be a big mistake to say that enunciating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reasons was a waste of time.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes it takes a bit of heat under the collar to motivate writing a post
<br>
like that one. Maybe I'm just human after all. Emotions will creep in at all
<br>
kinds of inconvenient times, the pesky things.
<br>
<p>I was pretty angry at the time. I have this hazy idea that genocide is at
<br>
the extreme edge of a package of very nasty memes that are gaining currency
<br>
nowadays in western geopolitics, a package that includes xenophobia,
<br>
intolerance and self righteousness. Fear of the unknown, and ignorant petty
<br>
selfishness, qualities which seem to be encouraged more strongly as time
<br>
wears on, really will bring down the dreams of all transhumanists.
