<p>It is not at all true that only large companies are able to off-shore some of 
<br>
their work.  I work for a company of &lt; 100 people who uses some off-shore 
<br>
labor on a contract basis occassionally.  The off-shore labor is cheaper for 
<br>
the tasks needed (in this case, much of the manual portion of QA testing).  
<br>
The skill basis of off-shore workers is rising faster than their 
<br>
compensation.  So any company looking to remain competitive must consider 
<br>
such options.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; A kind of protectionism, that would make Smoot-Hartley blush is on its way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this will be a limit on off-shoring of jobs, not manufactured goods. On
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It is amusing when supposed capitalist argue that it is greedy and 
<br>
shortsighted to find the lowest costs for materials and labor that one can to 
<br>
produce the products and services.   It is even more ironically amusing when 
<br>
pro-globalization folks decry competition in labor and goods from other 
<br>
countries.   It looks as if some folks are only fair-weather friends of open 
<br>
markets, capitalism and globalization.    
<br>
<p>There is nothing that does or should guarantee you or I a job at or near the 
<br>
same rate as we have today or had two years ago for the same or nearly the 
<br>
same work.  This is inherent in a period of accelerated change and rapidly 
<br>
advancing technology.   We can discuss whether there should be more 
<br>
guarantees and safety nets but it is hypocritical as hell to decry these 
<br>
outcomes for ourselves while expecting other people around the world to grin 
<br>
an bear it for their own good.   Who are we trying to kid?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Have you ever noticed that those who &quot;run&quot; corporations have never

<p>Sigh.  This is really juvenile.
