<br>
<p><em>&gt; Slashdot discussion on this:

<p>but Randy also quoted Damien's perception that this is
<br>
only a *hoax*:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I see that this poorly written and somewhat Sokal-like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; piece of fluff is attributed to a PR agent:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:Brooke.Jones@australia.edu?Subject=RE:%20Ground-breaking%20work%20in%20understanding%20of%20time">Brooke.Jones@australia.edu</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    Independent Communications Consultant 
</em><br>
<p>and Damien quotes what may prove to be the most damaging
<br>
or to cynics and skeptics the most self-evident BS:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Naturally the parameter and boundary of their respective position and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; magnitude are naturally determinable up to the limits of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; measurement as stated by the general quantum hypothesis and Heisenberg's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uncertainty principle, but this indeterminacy in precise value is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consequence of quantum uncertainty. What this illustrates is that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relation to indeterminacy in precise physical magnitude, the micro and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; macroscopic are inextricably linked, both being a part of the same parcel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than just a case of the former underlying and contributing to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; latter.&quot; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Naturally. Yeep.
</em><br>
<p>Guilio adds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When this was announced a few days ago I was curious, so I downloaded both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers of Lynds are read them. Perhaps I did not understand anything of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he is trying to say,
</em><br>
<p>Well, I will suggest that Damien is right and that there
<br>
is a VERY GOOD REASON that you did not understand anything.
<br>
It is a joke.  And a poster to slashdot didn't get it either.
<br>
<p>Moreover, it demonstrates again just how dependent all of
<br>
us really are on the scientific community. It would be easy
<br>
to collect a stack of the most impressive looking books and
<br>
documents, all of which would defy any of the contributors
<br>
to this list in the sense that (unless we depended on the
<br>
scientific community as a whole) we would have no way of
<br>
refuting, but which, nonetheless would have been written
<br>
by crackpots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I was not impressed.
</em><br>
<p>Good for you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that he is assuming from the very beginning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what he wants to prove, and that he is not explaining why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the standard view of these things (that we learn in first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year calculus) is wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Well, who can blame most of us for being taken in?  One reads
<br>
so many incredible things, say by Hawking or David Deutsch,
<br>
which, though eminently respectable in the long run, produce
<br>
the same feelings at first of incomprehension.
<br>
<p>(It's also important not to overreact in the other direction,
<br>
and to assume that any new theory seemingly at odds with what
<br>
we know must automatically be wrong, of course.)
