Alcor News Report:  8/13/03
<br>
<p>=============================================================
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewed Ted Williams Controversy: An Interim Response
<br>
<p><p>Earlier this year Alcor News reported that we hired Larry
<br>
Johnson, a nationally certified paramedic, to manage our
<br>
standby/transport work and emergency response capability.
<br>
Larry came to us with excellent references and was actively
<br>
helpful in implementing a major revision of our meds kits. He
<br>
participated in our March training sessions and also helped
<br>
to train paramedics in Phoenix and Florida. Larry became an
<br>
Alcor member and made no secret of this. He told a CBS TV
<br>
news team from Los Angeles that he had always wanted to see
<br>
the future, and he seemed to feel that cryonics would help
<br>
him to get there.
<br>
<p>In two cases, Larry made a decisive difference by giving
<br>
emergency guidance over the phone. He helped to minimize
<br>
ischemic damage and made a radical difference to the
<br>
condition of the cryopatients in these cases. We were
<br>
impressed by his assistance generally, and were glad to have
<br>
him at Alcor.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately Larry seemed to feel unhappy with some aspects
<br>
of Alcor. He had come to us from a very large, well-funded
<br>
paramedic facility where he had been better compensated.
<br>
Apparently he nursed a grudge to such an extent that he
<br>
provided a reporter at Sports Illustrated with confidential
<br>
information which seemed calculated to damage Alcor as much
<br>
as possible. The news item was picked up by The Associated
<br>
Press and triggered reports from sources such as The New
<br>
York Times and The Arizona Republic.
<br>
<p>We were astonished and dismayed that a nationally certified
<br>
paramedic would behave in such a way, without any significant
<br>
provocation that we are aware of. We had done everything we
<br>
could to get to know Larry and verify that he was an ethical
<br>
person whom we could trust.
<br>
<p>Fortunately Alcor has accumulated some redundancy among its
<br>
field team members during the past year. We can still respond
<br>
well in an emergency. In the meantime, in reply to some of
<br>
Larry Johnson's allegations, we are providing the news media
<br>
with information explaining that our procedures are
<br>
formulated to minimize damage, not create it.
<br>
<p>In particular, the damage caused by fracturing when a
<br>
vitrified cryopatient is cooled to liquid-nitrogen
<br>
temperature is small compared with the cellular damage that
<br>
used to occur using glycerol as a cryoprotectant. While we
<br>
won't be entirely happy until the day when we achieve zero-
<br>
damage cryopreservation, we are absolutely convinced that
<br>
repair of simple fractures will be easy compared with the
<br>
reconstruction of cellular debris that used to be caused by
<br>
ice formation.
<br>
<p>Also, when we use a perforator (a standard medical tool) in
<br>
our operating room to create two small burr holes in the
<br>
skull, this is a precaution enabling us to inspect the
<br>
surface of the brain during cryoprotective perfusion.
<br>
Observation of the brain is a safety measure to reduce the
<br>
risk of edema. Here again, we tolerate a small amount of
<br>
damage in the interests of avoiding much greater damage. (A
<br>
burr hole can be repaired even with today's medicine.)
<br>
<p>Finally we must emphasize, contrary to news reports, that
<br>
Alcor has never collected &quot;DNA samples&quot; from its
<br>
cryopatients. Obviously Alcor has no need to collect &quot;DNA
<br>
samples,&quot; since a neuropatient already contains billions of
<br>
DNA molecules. We may collect venous effluent samples during
<br>
the perfusion of a cryopatient, but the purpose of these
<br>
samples is to evaluate blood chemistry via standard lab
<br>
tests.
<br>
<p>So far as we can tell, Larry Johnson took some of Alcor's
<br>
property away with him when he disappeared without warning at
<br>
the end of the weekend of August 9th and 10th. During the
<br>
preceding weeks he recorded conversations with Alcor
<br>
employees without notifying them or seeking their permission,
<br>
and he probably viewed confidential documents. We will be
<br>
taking appropriate action. Alcor must make a clear statement
<br>
that it will not be intimidated by the threat of bad press
<br>
and will not tolerate gross violations of its standard
<br>
nondisclosure agreement by employees or ex-employees.
<br>
<p>We will provide additional updates when we have any
<br>
significant news to report. Currently we have been unable to
<br>
reach Larry Johnson via phone or email, despite repeated
<br>
attempts. If he has any statement to make regarding our
<br>
description of what we believe he did, we invite his
<br>
response.
