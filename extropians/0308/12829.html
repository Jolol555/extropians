Not they haven't done anything, but perhaps they've done less than the 
<br>
dollar figures indicate.  It's rather like MS giving away software.  
<br>
Yes, they've given a word processor.  And that has value.  But they kept 
<br>
the money.  They decided what you would buy with their &quot;gift&quot;, and it 
<br>
was something they made.  And they took the tax writeoff as full sale 
<br>
value.  But if what you needed was a bed, it's not as satisfying as 
<br>
getting the money.   (Actually, for me it wouldn't be as satisfying 
<br>
anyway.  I'm perfectly satisfied with the MSOffice97 that I bought.  And 
<br>
I'm replacing it with OpenOffice.org.  So I'm not even going to bother 
<br>
filling out the paperwork.  (Some lawsuit verdict!)
<br>
<p>It doesn't only happen in foreign aid.  It's endemic throughout the 
<br>
system.  And I am much less than grateful to be the recipient of the 
<br>
right to some MS software as payment for *their* misdeeds.  They should 
<br>
pay me to take it.  (Only it would have to be without their EULAs and 
<br>
renewal requirements, or I wouldn't even then.)
