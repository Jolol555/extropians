</em><br>
<p>*Possibly* not, but again, I don't think this kind of terrorism is a big

threat, personal-riskwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you think you have a 2nd Amendment right? Because it is to

</em><br>
<p>I actually don't have a 2nd amendment right since I don't live in the
<br>
USA, and I'm sure this argument has happened a million times in gun
<br>
circles that I don't frequent, but I'll say it anyway: last ditch is too
<br>
late.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can defend yourself against these threats, but only if you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually willing to do so. Many people lack the frame of mind necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to self defense, especially against abstract threats. The bad guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't need to be shooting at you to have already initiated force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against you.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly my point. After 9/11, civil liberties were cut down. Did
<br>
you use force against that? When the threat is abstract, how can you
<br>
tell whether or not to use force? If the government doubled income tax,
<br>
would you shoot anyone? If you believe in a slippery slope towards
<br>
totalitarianism, at what point on that slope do you stop lobbying and
<br>
start firing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the opposition outlaws your existence, they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loosed the dogs of war, for they have authorized the use of the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; police apparatus to use force against you. The only rational response
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to such an initiation of force is to respond with force.
</em><br>
<p>I'm still thinking &quot;too late&quot;. Are you seriously talking about having a
<br>
shootout with the police/army?
