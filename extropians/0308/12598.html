<p>Spin interactions are electromagnetic, so you get the usual 1/r^2 drop

<p>Not really, and you are essentially (ignoring the spin coupling part 
<br>
which is likely tricky hardware) scaling up an ordinary cluster 
<br>
architecture. Some problems with long latencies, but nothing unusual. I 
<br>
would likely go with optic communications instead, although having 
<br>
reversible communication (Robin has an old paper about it, very 
<br>
creative!) would be neat.

<p>Use it for porn first. Seriously. Maybe computer games too. While

<br>
an engineering mindset), to get something built soon and creatively it
<br>
better give people what they want. The www was a success thanks to 
<br>
showing pictures rather than being a clever solution. Once people have 
<br>
funded the start of the M-brain to process their porn, spam, games and 
<br>
backup mindstates, then we can build the useful stuff on top of it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Storage would have to be standard, I'm only proposing a communication

</em><br>
<p>Such laws only work up to physical limits (although they nicely enough 
<br>
do sneak around them quite often). There are problems with long-range 
<br>
communications. Here is the relevant part of my paper (in LaTeX 
<br>
notation):
<br>
<p>\subsection{Bandwidth}
<br>
<p>\begin{quote}
<br>
There is an old network saying: Bandwidth problems can be cured with
<br>
money.  Latency problems are harder because the speed of light is
<br>
fixed.  You can't bribe God.  -- David Clark
<br>
\end{quote}
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the amount of information that can be sent over an
<br>
information channel is limited. According to the Nyquist theorem, the
<br>
highest signal rate that can be carried over a channel with bandwidth
<br>
$W$ Hz is $C = 2W$ bits/second.  By using multilevel signaling $C = 2W
<br>
\log_2 M$, where $M$ is the number of discrete signal levels, but the
<br>
more levels in the signal, the more noise-sensitive it
<br>
becomes. Furthermore, forcing a physical quantity into one of $2^k$
<br>
possible ranges seems to be $2^k$ as hard as forcing it into one of
<br>
two ranges, rather than just $k$ times as hard \cite{Bennett94}. In
<br>
the following we will assume binary signals through the channel.
<br>
<p>Using higher and higher frequencies of the electromagnetic
<br>
spectrum extremely high signal rates can be sent in a directional
<br>
manner, for example using lasers. Unfortunately there are some
<br>
problems involved with extremely high frequencies due to pair
<br>
production: in the presence of another particle or a field, the
<br>
gamma-ray photon may split up into pairs of electrons and
<br>
positrons. This occurs at a frequency of
<br>
<p>\begin{equation}\nu = {2 m_e c^2 \over h}\end{equation}
<br>
<p>at a bandwidth of $2 \nu \approx 4.9\cdot 10^{20}$ bit/s.  Although
<br>
this does not necessarily imply a limit on the bandwidth, it implies a
<br>
growing source of noise.  And since the energies of individual quanta
<br>
become higher, the number of quanta per Watt signal-strength decreases,
<br>
leading to increasing noise (see below).
<br>
<p>Also, there is an upper limit to the rate of information that can be
<br>
sent using electromagnetic radiation for a given average energy
<br>
\cite{Caves94, Lachmann99}:
<br>
\begin{equation}
<br>
C=\left(\frac{512\pi^4}{1215h^3c^2}\frac{A_tA_r}{d^2}E^3\right)^{1/4}
<br>
\end{equation}
<br>
where $A_t$ and $A_r$ are the areas of the the transmitter and
<br>
receiver respectively, $d$ their distance and $E$ the power of the
<br>
transmitter. For a transmitter and receiver one square meter each one
<br>
meter apart and with a 1 J/s energy budget the information rate is
<br>
$1.61\cdot 10^{21}$ bits per second. The rate scales as $E^{3/4}$. The
<br>
optimal spectrum turns out to correspond to blackbody radiation, but
<br>
if the receiver can only detect the energy and timing of arriving
<br>
photons the spectrum instead corresponds to the spectrum of black
<br>
bodies in a one-dimensional world and the information rate becomes
<br>
\begin{equation}
<br>
C=\left(\frac{4\pi^2}{3h}E\right)^{1/2}
<br>
\end{equation}
<br>
which is independent of transmitter and receiver area and
<br>
distance. For an 1 J/s energy budget the maximum information rate
<br>
becomes $2.03\cdot 10^{17}$.
<br>
<p>One obvious way to circumvent this problem is to send information
<br>
encoded in small pieces of matter at high speed. The energy
<br>
requirements are much larger when lightspeed is approached, so the
<br>
energy efficiency
<br>
\begin{equation}
<br>
\eta = {C \over P} = \frac{km}{(\gamma -1) mc^2}
<br>
= \frac{k}{c^2} {\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2} \over {1-\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}}
<br>
\end{equation}
<br>
(where $P$ is the energy used to accelerate the matter, $k$ is the
<br>
number of bits per kilogram and $v$ is the final speed) decreases
<br>
towards zero. On the other hand, the efficiency for very low speeds is
<br>
high, but is balanced by the longer delays.
<br>
<p>As always, Bekenstein's bound introduces a constraint on information
<br>
flow. The message channel can be viewed as a chain of regions of size
<br>
$R$ containing energy $E$, in which information flows from one to the
<br>
next in time $R/c$ (assuming light-speed transmission). This gives a
<br>
bandwidth limitation of
<br>
\begin{equation}
<br>
C \leq \left ({2 \pi c \over \hbar \ln 2} \right) {R E \over (R /c)} = 
<br>
\left ({\
<br>
2 \pi \over \hbar \ln 2} \right) E
<br>
\end{equation}
<br>
or around $9\cdot10^{34}$ bit/(s J).
<br>
<p>Regardless of the amount of energy used in transmitting information,
<br>
an additional limit is the Planck bandwidth
<br>
\begin{equation}W = 2 \sqrt{c^5/hG} = 2\cdot 10^{43} {\rm 
<br>
bit/s}\end{equation}
<br>
At this bandwidth, quantum gravity becomes important and the
<br>
wavelength of individual quanta becomes less than their
<br>
Schwartzchild-radius.
<br>
<p>It should be noted that the above limits apply to single channels; by
<br>
using several noninteracting channels the information transmission
<br>
can be increased further.
<br>
<p>\subsection{Noise}
<br>
\label{sec:noise}
<br>
In reality, the channel capacity is somewhat lower due to noise.
<br>
Shannon demonstrated that the maximal channel capacity (also
<br>
called the error-free capacity) in the presence of noise is
<br>
<p>\begin{equation}C= W \log_2 (1+ {S \over N})\end{equation}
<br>
<p>where $S$ is the signal power and $N$ the noise power. Shannon also
<br>
proved that if the information rate is lower than the error-free
<br>
capacity, then it is possible to use a suitable coding to completely
<br>
avoid errors.  If energy dissipation is no problem, then noise can be
<br>
ignored. Otherwise, the bandwidth will at least grow as the logarithm
<br>
of the power used.
<br>
<p>Noise leads to the problem that energy has to be expended in
<br>
sending the information. In a noiseless channel information can be
<br>
sent without dissipation \cite{Landauer94}, but the minimum energy per
<br>
unit of information required to transmit information over a channel
<br>
with effective noise temperature $T$ satisfies the inequality
<br>
\begin{equation}\frac{E}{I}\geq kT \label{eq:levitin}\end{equation}
<br>
as shown by \cite{Levitin98}. The dissipation will be $E(T)$ J, where
<br>
$E(T)$ is the minimum possible energy for the system with a given
<br>
entropy; not all energy used in the information channel will be lost.
<br>
<p>For extremely dense and high-bandwith systems energy dissipation from
<br>
communication will likely play an important role, a role that cannot
<br>
easily be circumvented with reversible computing. The exact amount of
<br>
communications used is however very architecture dependent, ranging
<br>
from nearly none in passive repositories of information to $R^6$ in
<br>
3D-structures where every node communicates with every other node.
