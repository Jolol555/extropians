<p><em>&gt;This post will sound harsh but fair; I think it's the best way to show you

<em>&gt;I think this community can be percieved negatively because of that &quot;having

</em><br>
<p>Tribe is not a term that transhumanists use.  The only group of futurists I 
<br>
know who believe they are a &quot;tribe&quot; is a group who are into the singularity 
<br>
(not Eli).
<br>
<p>So, please don't use &quot;tribe&quot; because the connotations are inappropriate here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This situation saddens me because I find myself &quot;shot by both sides&quot; :
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropianism and the majority of people are either at best lacking the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;historical culture to know these ideas are old hat or at worst voluntarly
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Another false assumption on your part.  First, drop the &quot;ism&quot; from extropy 
<br>
and we can much better communicate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The visions and methodology of Extropianism hardly makes it a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Charles Fourier, great historian of the future, philosopher of glorious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;musical tomorrows of harmonious bodies, way after civilizations, when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flesh will be invested of ideal qualities , who was appreciated by Marx and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Engels, was proposing an harmonian revolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's some traduction of passages from Oeuvre complètes tome VIII and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bulletin de Lyon, 1804:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;humanity will wake itself to the materialist ameliorations it's body is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suceptible to.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He was forecasting living on other planets since at this point the earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be too small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;New and useful properties gained by earthlings living in these new celestal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries: amphiby, night vision, perpetual growth of hairs and teeths,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indolorism , whitening to the sun etc&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Forecasting genetic manipulations:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;from their torso a new appendice would grow: used either as a powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weapon, to prevent falls, a superb ornament with infinite force and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dexterity. Habitants of suns, lactées and ringed planets like saturn are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amphibious, by the effect of an ouverture in the casing of their heart, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a fifth member common to both sex: the archiarm who can kill an animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in one shot, be used as a whirling parachute, a motor for fake wings, a rope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ladder, a swim-aid that gives man the velocity of a fish and thousand ohter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibilities either on earth or in the seas. The archiarm triples
</em><br>
<em>&gt;productivity of the industry and bring the body at it's ultimate degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological perfection.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(He too, as I said in another post, could be a promoter of impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bodies, but that's another story...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That ought to be enough for the vision part. A bit frivolous and funny but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not much more than saying that in the future our children will be few and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immensely valued, huanity will have to deal with hypermaturity  etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the methodological front, I present you Condorcet who concludes his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de l'esprit humain_  by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predicting the end of stupidity, hypocrisy and the emergence of a new body
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made possible by technological, scientific and medical progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sounds cutting edge? It was written in 1795.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Death is percieved as a hypothesis to be reserved to exceptional cases like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accidents or rare probabilities. The lenght of life, considerably augmented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;get close to for ever (...) an unlimited lenght&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So it is : a body who escaped the laws of nature and entropy ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Genuine ignorance or vanity, it doesn't matter to me: as a group,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extropians/transhumanists are a bit too eager to misread their predecesor in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order to make room for themselves...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, using the structure of an &quot;institute&quot; / &quot;school of philosophy&quot; is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;massive philosophical regression, sad, a system of terror, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretention of making something new but is a king-sized povrety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think we have great dreams but extropians don't go at it the right way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Don't even think of calling Fourier and Condorcet  proto extropians, please,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that would be disingenious for the other way around woud be more logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since they are already accepted in the academic network, humanity's common
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cultural heritage and they had more historical influence than their current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;poor unsuccessful incarnation: extropianism is just a materialism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realizing it by droping the usless brand name would be the mature thing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do for it would help in getting credibility and real life traction to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;common dreams.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rejoice! You are not an extropian, you are a materialist ! :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are part of a tradition and your ideas are accepted more easily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do I think this post will change anything to the established order?  I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people who are branded extropians or transhumanists won't budge, I wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this for people  who will get interested in these problems of our time, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they won't needlessly cripple their game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;May our dreams be reality!
</em><br>
<p><p>No, because you use a hotmail account rather than communicate in a more 
<br>
open fashion and you try to pad your comments  with flowers and lace and 
<br>
all sorts of exclamations?
