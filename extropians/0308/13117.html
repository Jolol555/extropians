<p>John,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the blind side of Samantha, etal.  I have had two leading 
<br>
members of the hierarchy address me on the subject of Mike Lorry's departure.  In 
<br>
both cases I commented on the chortling and personal comments made this list 
<br>
after he was gone.  One member attempted to draw an equivalency between 
<br>
comments made about a man that could not respond and comments made while he was here. 
<br>
&nbsp;The other claimed no comments had been made.  Unbelievable.  Those comments 
<br>
exposed a one sided-ness I haven't seen in years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been two people on this list that have demonstrated to me 
<br>
they are even handed.  The first is Hal (I don't know his last name) and the 
<br>
other is Lee Corbin.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All others have show a one sided blindness and in some cases a 
<br>
partisanship.
