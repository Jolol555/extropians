Lee, we had some quarrels. And I had some violent exchanges with Mike
<br>
Lorrey, too.
<br>
<p>It has always been my point of view to really express what I feel about the
<br>
view of other posters. There are times when you have to forget your
<br>
politeness. I guess from what you write today that it might have been better
<br>
to really have said what you thought - sometimes.
<br>
<p>I understand that it's not everyone's business to endure name calling or
<br>
these ominous &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks, but . . . hell . . . what the fuck . . .
<br>
you say dirty words, some people are not amused, others know it's only too
<br>
human. Having expressed my indignation about your or Mike Lorrey's opinions,
<br>
I think I would for example gladly  join you and Mike for a weekend picknick
<br>
anyway, because I know you both are decent guys and we could learn from each
<br>
other  simply *because* we think differently.
<br>
<p>I think it was wrong to expell Mike Lorrey from the list. My first reaction
<br>
was to propose an exchange deal: they let Mike Lorrey come back and I leave
<br>
the forum till the new list is established in September. But now, after
<br>
second thoughts, I suggest it:
<br>
<p>Let Mike come back, I leave till September.
<br>
It would be a great loss if you left the list, Lee.
<br>
<p>Please stay with us and start &quot;taking back all my fine words, renouncing
<br>
my praise&quot;. This should be interesting and a step forward to hear the truth
<br>
behind all the politeness.
<br>
<p>Hubert

Subject: Lee Corbin's Goodbye
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; About a week ago, a contributor of long standing was suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and summarily expelled from this list, an act that seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me capricious and perhaps arbitrary, and for several days after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, I didn't feel like posting anything.  During that time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that I was just annoyed, and that it would pass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But my feelings on the matter did not change in the days
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following, and I finally figured out why.  It was due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the large number of posts I'd written and threads that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had started in the past two years extolling to the skies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list and the people who ran it; the theme of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many, many posts was that through thick and thin, freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of speech had always won out in the end on the Extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I now feel like a fool.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I could live with that---after all, one does many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolish things in life and one gets over it after a while.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there is something far worse than looking or being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will not be a hypocrite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My only choices are to either leave this list, or begin a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of posts taking back all my fine words, renouncing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my praise, and admitting that my perceptions had been wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or else pleading that actions like this never recur, or, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.---moves sure to foment controversy and ugly discord (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would probably result in my own expulsion anyway).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any lessons learned?  So far, only one: be temperate in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; praise of others, else you will come to feel responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their actions.  I hadn't known that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So anyway, in a single sentence there is no way for me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate the appreciation I have of what I have learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, the information I've gleaned, the friendships I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made, the laughs I've had, or the stimulating, productive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and entertaining discourse I've been privileged to be a part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of.  It's been fun.  Good-bye, and good luck to everyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
