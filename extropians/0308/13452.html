The following excerpt from an article in Science magazine
<br>
of 29th August suggests there could be opportunities for 
<br>
some novel suggestions on which genomes could be most
<br>
usefully sequenced next.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
Sequencers Examine Priorities
<br>
Jennifer Couzin
<br>
<p>&quot;Now that genomes can be decoded quickly, researchers are
<br>
debating how to choose which organisms to sequence next&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;...with all the &quot;obvious&quot; organisms--including the human, the 
<br>
mouse, and the rat--now sequenced, or nearly so, the genetics
<br>
community and NHGRI, its principal funder, are weighing how
<br>
to proceed. The country's three massive sequencing centers,
<br>
fearful of becoming mere factories churning out base after base,
<br>
are lobbying to preserve influence in choosing which organisms
<br>
to sequence and analyzing the genetic data they produce.
<br>
Scientists who mobilized around beloved animals, from the 
<br>
honeybee to the chicken, and won them a spot in the sequencing
<br>
queue are now wondering what they will target next.
<br>
<p>The 30 to 40 prominent researchers who attended the meeting,
<br>
many of whom commented with surprise on its collegiality, 
<br>
agreed that sequencing should now be driven by biological 
<br>
unknowns rather than popularity contests. &quot;We should turn
<br>
to using sequencing capacity to answer scientific questions 
<br>
that are of seminal importance,&quot; wrote Princeton University
<br>
President Shirley Tilghman in an e-mail message. And if that
<br>
means sequencing an organism &quot;that by biologists' standard is 
<br>
obscure,&quot; she added, &quot;so be it.&quot;
<br>
<p>....
<br>
<p>&quot;Implicit in the choice of which genomes to sequence lies a 
<br>
greater uncertainty: If genomes should be selected based on 
<br>
the biological mysteries they could help solve, which mysteries
<br>
top the list? That was something last month's collegial meeting
<br>
steered clear of. &quot;It delayed the hard issues,&quot; such as whether
<br>
to award one vertebrate at the expense of 40 Drosophila, with
<br>
their much smaller genomes, says Green. Which ones win out,
<br>
at least in the short term, will be a topic for another day.&quot;
<br>
-------
<br>
<p>I used to have the view that sequencing whales and elephants,
<br>
animals with large numbers of cells, as cells are roughly the
<br>
same size in all organisms, and big beasts have more of them,
<br>
might tell us something useful about aging, dna repair and 
<br>
cancer avoidance. I seem to recall that Aubrey de Grey was
<br>
not convinced that this would shed all that much light. 
<br>
<p>I wonder what folks interested in the aging process like Robert
<br>
and Aubrey would choose if they could get the genomes they
<br>
wanted sequenced soonest?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
