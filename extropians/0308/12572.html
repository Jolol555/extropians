<p>There are strong indications that microbial life is
<br>
widespread at depth in the crust of the Earth, just as
<br>
such life has been identified in numerous ocean vents.
<br>
This life is not dependent on solar energy and
<br>
photosynthesis for its primary energy supply, and it
<br>
is essentially independent of the surface
<br>
circumstances. Its energy supply comes from chemical
<br>
sources,...
<br>
<p>and 
<br>
<p>Subsurface life may be widespread among the planetary
<br>
bodies of our solar system, since many of them have
<br>
equally suitable conditions below, while having
<br>
totally inhospitable surfaces. One may even speculate
<br>
that such life may be widely disseminated in the
<br>
universe, since planetary type bodies with similar
<br>
sub-surface conditions may be common as solitary
<br>
objects in space, as well as in other solar-type
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>...the &quot;ocean vents&quot;, found first in some small
<br>
regions of the ocean floor, but now found to be
<br>
widespread (2), proved to have an energy supply for
<br>
its life that was totally independent of sunlight and
<br>
all surface energy sources. There the energy for life
<br>
was derived from chemical processes,...  
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>It may be that we shall find a simple general rule to
<br>
apply: that microbial life exists in all the locations
<br>
where microbes can survive; that would mean all the
<br>
locations that have a chemical energy supply and that
<br>
are at a temperature below the maximum one to which
<br>
microbes can adapt. 
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>The other planetary bodies in our solar system do not
<br>
have favorable circumstances for **surface** life. 
<br>
<p>but
<br>
<p>Many planetary bodies will have temperature and
<br>
pressure regimes in their interiors that would allow
<br>
liquid water to exist.
<br>
<p>and 
<br>
<p>The surface life on the Earth, based on photosynthesis
<br>
for its overall energy supply, may be just one strange
<br>
branch of life, an adaptation specific to a planet
<br>
that happened to have such favorable circumstances on
<br>
its surface as would occur only very rarely...
<br>
<p>The deep, chemically supplied life, however, may be
<br>
very common in the universe.

<p>Read the entire piece for the full story.  Great fun.

<p>&quot;When I am working on a problem I never think about
<br>
beauty. I only think about how to solve the problem.
<br>
But when I have finished, if the solution is not
<br>
beautiful, I know it is wrong.&quot;
