Emlyn:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Decent electric cars would do the job. Then we could use any generation
<br>
method that we could dream up.

<p>&quot;We can't make our cars run on dreams. After more then 100 years, we have no
<br>
all-electric vehicles that can compare in utility, and performance, then
<br>
vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine. Comming up wih &quot;decent
<br>
electric
<br>
cars&quot; is like saying 'if we can come up with a decent fusion reaction
<br>
system..&quot;  Making an all-electric vehicle, and setting up fast re-charing
<br>
stations, is
<br>
more difficult then it seems. I realize that it is 'anti-intuitive' that
<br>
this
<br>
should be so, but it is how the world is. (sigh!) &quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>I'm inclined to think that your analogy here is a bit strained: for one
<br>
thing partially electric cars could solve some of the problems whereas it is
<br>
a little difficult to doing anything with a partial decent fusion reaction
<br>
system. For example, estimates from
<br>
<a href="http://www.e2i.org/docs/Plug-in_Hybrid.pdf">http://www.e2i.org/docs/Plug-in_Hybrid.pdf</a> suggest that a &quot;plug-in&quot; hybrid
<br>
vehicle would help reduce dependence on oil. The idea is that the batteries
<br>
would get you about 40 miles before they need to be recharged, so if you
<br>
need to go further than 40 miles the gasoline engine kicks in. Otherwise you
<br>
plug the car in and recharge the batteries. Most people take short trips
<br>
most of the time. Of course you still need to generate electricity somehow,
<br>
but the point is that it could be done by any number of generating
<br>
techniques, as Emlyn rightly points out. (Some European countries are now up
<br>
in the 20% range of electricity generated from wind.) I'm no engineer (as I
<br>
am about to prove) but I'm not sure why you couldn't make an electric
<br>
vehicle where at least some of the batteries pop out and are replaced by
<br>
charged batteries. Suppose for example when you bought your car you leased
<br>
your batteries from some company, say Exxon. (Gotta have something for the
<br>
poor multinational to do). A decent electric vehicle will get about 100
<br>
miles on a charge. Suppose on those occasions where you need to travel more
<br>
than 100 miles you could pull into an Exxon station and a little robot would
<br>
pull out your spent batteries and replace them with charged ones. Even if
<br>
only half the batteries could be pulled out in this manner this would still
<br>
give you an additional 50 miles. Since you are leasing the batteries from
<br>
Exxon they will be pleased to switch out the batteries and recharge them for
<br>
the next customer. Of course they will charge you extra for this service.
<br>
Obviously this would be inconvenient for long road trips--stopping every 50
<br>
miles for a battery change. In this case I suppose one would rent a trailer
<br>
that runs on fossil fuels and turns an electric generator to power the car.
<br>
In these rare times that I travel more than 100 miles in one shot this would
<br>
definitely not be as convenient. But this is at most maybe 6 times a year.
<br>
As it is now, I've got to make a weekly stop at the gas station, so this
<br>
setup would definitely be more convenient. I'd love to come home and simply
<br>
plug-in.
