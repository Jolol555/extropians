<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">Spudboy100@aol.com</a> writes: Actually, this is the new hatred of a pampered class-driven bunch 
<br>
of people who, appear to have NO entrpenuerial accumen. They achieved their 
<br>
places in corporations, by knowing the right people. Its not as if businessmen 
<br>
and women who have started suuccessful companies, themselves have achieved 
<br>
their place on the boards of directors, and are now guiding companies. Rather, 
<br>
they are suck-ups, who, with no sense of responsibility to their stockholders, 
<br>
let alone, society at large, are guiding their corporations, right onto the 
<br>
iceberg.
<br>
<p>Mitch, according to my understanding of capitalist theory this is good.  I 
<br>
believe it was Marx that complained that a capitalist society was in a constant 
<br>
stage of change.  Marx was right but he didn't understand that is what makes 
<br>
us strong.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to have beneficial change this group, that are as you 
<br>
describe them, has to go.  Right now they seem to have the idea they can survive and 
<br>
thrive by seeking out sources of cheap labor.  Being thugs at heart they are 
<br>
also finding dictatorships (communist and other) that will sell them labor at 
<br>
slave labor prices.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these thugs will not prosper.  As I see it they will be replaced 
<br>
here and elsewhere by better smarter managers.  I see those managers coming 
<br>
from people such as you find on this list.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also see you (plural) operating in two ways, first as entreprenuers 
<br>
and investors, second in politics to demand reform.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what you intend to do.  I am retired but I hope to 
<br>
generate sufficient income to return to investing -- investing in companies that are 
<br>
led by good managers.
<br>
