<p>Quotes:
<br>
The number of people with Alzheimer's could treble by 2050, say US 
<br>
researchers, as the population surges and existing patients live longer.
<br>
Scientists project that some 13.2 million older Americans will have 
<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) by 2050 unless new ways are found to prevent or 
<br>
treat the disease.
<br>
<p>The US team, from Rush Institute on Healthy Aging, claimed that the huge 
<br>
rise could effectively bankrupt the country's medicare system, and 
<br>
called for more funding for research into treatments.
<br>
<p>The primary cause of the rise is the fact that many more people are 
<br>
expected to live into their 80s and 90s in the future.
<br>
<p>Beyond 80, as many as one in five people has some form of dementia.
<br>
Many require highly expensive health and social care, and it is possible 
<br>
that the disease will not greatly alter their lifespan.
<br>
<p>End quotes.
<br>
<p><p>The authorities seem to be depending on the hope that research will find 
<br>
a cure before these projections become reality.
<br>
<p>Referring back to the previous thread about early retirement, it seems 
<br>
that not only will the working population have to pay for more and more 
<br>
pensions for people that are living longer, but they will also have to 
<br>
pay for more and more medical and social care costs as well.
<br>
<p>Better retire soon, while you still can!
