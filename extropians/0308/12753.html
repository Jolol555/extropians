<em>&gt; &gt; and take work at whatever the market prices dictate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        This is partially a case of outsourcing by top management
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a cheaper source of labor but it is also a case of operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people not entering into the competition for the jobs they have.
</em><br>
<p>Yes---that's my point, right?  I'm learning from this thread
<br>
already, mostly due to me, however.  Okay, so what about this:
<br>
nobody moves their operations to India or wherever if there
<br>
are people around here who will do the work at the market
<br>
rate.  Now if the alternative were starvation (it never is
<br>
in Socialist America) the marketplace would smoothly determine
<br>
the (lower) wage for something about to be outsourced, and it
<br>
would stay right here.  Only if Americans could make *more*
<br>
money, ideally, doing something else, should the jobs move.
<br>
<p>If the latter is ever the case, namely that there really
<br>
are literally too few people here for some tasks, then by
<br>
God it is good that foreigners will trade with us and do
<br>
the work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        I have been in a company, the Electromotive Division of (General 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Motors??) where the entire company was slowly moving to Canada.  Way too many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers were concerned only with early getting retirement when the company finally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected them for unemployment.  I saw labor utilization that was so wrong it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was insane with operating management doing nothing to improve the situation.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I felt like Alice in Wonderland.
</em><br>
<p>Could you explain more how this happened?  There has to be
<br>
a reason why GM would find itself moving from Socialist
<br>
America to even more Socialist Canada.  So far as I can see,
<br>
you have not explained the underlying reasons (or I didn't 
<br>
get it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Lee, you also said, &quot;I urge everyone to carefully attend to Rafal's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *economic* arguments.  So far in perusing this thread, he appears to be the only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one up on free-market economics, who understands thoroughly why protectionism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always hurts everyone in the long run.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I can't for the life of me understand why having one side of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transaction practice free market economics while the other party to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transaction practices protectionism to beggar the first party can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described as a free market economy or beneficial to all concerned.
</em><br>
<p>Those who do protectionism only hurt *themselves*.  Yes!  It is so.
<br>
<p>Say the J in country J won't buy our beef and pay more to have
<br>
it produced locally.  Who is hurt?  Us a little, and them a lot!
<br>
More J people end up working to make expensive and poor quality
<br>
beef when they could---if they would just be smart and let the
<br>
marketplace tell them what to do---be more productively employed
<br>
making radios or VCRs or whatever they do best.
<br>
<p>Does what I am saying make sense?
<br>
<p>Lee
