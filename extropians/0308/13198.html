<p>Earlier this century? You mean, like, in 2001? :-)
<br>
<p>I think life in the U.S. is better now than it was, say, in 1950, for people
<br>
who are smart and mentally flexible, or who are able to learn a skill that
<br>
can't be economically replaced by machines. For the not-so-smart or the
<br>
inflexible or the unskilled, life is probably a bit worse now than it was
<br>
for such people in the 1950's, and unless our culture changes dramatically,
<br>
it will probably get even worse in the future.
<br>
<p>For the employer of highly skilled individuals, there is a significant cost
<br>
associated with each additional employee, including the cost of training; it
<br>
is cheaper to have one employee who works 60 hours per week than to have two
<br>
employees doing the same work. This is so, even though efficiency drops off
<br>
when a person works too many hours without a break. So even skilled workers
<br>
have a significant risk of being unemployed at any given time, unless they
<br>
can quickly learn a new skill when the need arises.
<br>
<p>Just my own observation, no hard statistics -- looks to me as though people
<br>
are being sorted out, by various market and political forces, into two major
<br>
groups -- the smart and flexible; and the rest. The smart and flexible group
<br>
would be comprised not only of honest, productive people but also of crafty
<br>
con artists who can and often do acheive their goals by using {the rest} in
<br>
nefarious ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   WHy is it that women get so upset when the plumbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts up...some kind of evolutionary thing?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. It's mechanically more difficult for women to discretely take a leak
<br>
into an empty milk jug.
<br>
