Samantha correctly observes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As long as people, individually or in political groups, have the desire and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power to control and force others to their idea of &quot;what is right&quot;, full 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency will be equivalent to full oversight and control.
</em><br>
<p>How would you outline the progress you anticipate (that is, 
<br>
if you're simply not full of despondency over our prospects)?
<br>
<p>How does our &quot;desire&quot; ever diminish to the point that groups
<br>
and individuals *never* initiate the use of force (except in
<br>
the defense of private property)?  On first reading, one might
<br>
think that you were calling for a spontaneous change in human
<br>
nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, &quot;full&quot; is not so full as long as there is no real way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to force the powers that be into such transparency.  All
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government groups to date do not agree that their operations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and proceedings should be transparent.  Again, full oversight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and control of the citizens by the government becomes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price of transparency.  Again, No, thank you.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand.  Why would you be unwilling to pay
<br>
this price?  I think that we should indeed aim for government
<br>
to be *fully* transparent first.
<br>
<p>The two may have to go hand in hand.  The western
<br>
governments will (rightly) refuse to be transparent
<br>
so long as formidable enemy societies have huge
<br>
nuclear arsenals aimed at them, or so long as 
<br>
terrorists and criminals can strike fear into the
<br>
hearts of millions.  (The U.S. appears to have made
<br>
great progress on the issue of the former.)
<br>
<p>When the U.S. is just a bit more powerful, perhaps
<br>
it can be persuaded to become completely open at the
<br>
same moment that universal surveillance is possible.
<br>
So, yes, Ashcroft is watching all of us to see who
<br>
is building basement nukes, but we are all watching
<br>
him to make sure that there are no non-public midnight
<br>
arrests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you really like your Mother, Boss or neighbours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be able to watch while you improve your prostate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; health (as described in a recent post) ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have overcome, at great cost and difficulty, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notion that I am or would be especially interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for people to observe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such trivial irrelevancies in the face of potentially creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a complete Big Brother situation are utterly amazing to me.
</em><br>
<p>Oh for God's sake.  You always surrender to some internal urge
<br>
to harp about something.  One of the issues (recall Natasha's
<br>
input) has always been---in this thread---how one would *feel*
<br>
about complete transparency.
<br>
<p>Lee
