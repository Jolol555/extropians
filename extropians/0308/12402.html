<em>&gt; So in what way are we misreading predecessors? You do not give any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;examples, just suggestive quotes that they &quot;had the same ideas&quot; (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather, have ideas similar to the ones we develop in the light of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current knowledge and ideas).
</em><br>
<p>That's it: since these ideas have been around I think it's not productive to
<br>
go through the motion of selling them again as &quot;new&quot; by grouping them under
<br>
a new brand; doing so sounds like a sleazy marketing move. Even if the only
<br>
contribution of extropianism to these ideas would have been an update in the
<br>
light of current knowledge, I'd say might as well also pick-up the old name
<br>
to do it and to improve on it. It is the honest thing to do and it is
<br>
usually the way philosophical views are thoroughly included into the
<br>
academic culture network, wich would be the best thing to do since they
<br>
would be diffused at least as much as other philosohers who addressed the
<br>
question of technology like Ellul, Heidegger, Latour, Marcuse, Dewey,
<br>
Ortega, Mumford etc and shine to their full potential.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; extropianism is just a materialism and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realizing it by droping the usless brand name would be the mature thing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do for it would help in getting credibility and real life traction to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common dreams.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rejoice! You are not an extropian, you are a materialist ! :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But what kind of materialist? Marxist materialist? Epicurean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;materialist? Reductive or eliminative materialist? That I am a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;materialist does not tell much about my ethics, my ideas of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constitutes the good life, my ideas of how knowledge can be acquired and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applied. Saying extropianism is just materialism is like saying it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just optimism - it takes a part (which is not even essential, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are Christian extropians who presumably are not materialists) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;says it is all.
</em><br>
<p>Making-up a word like &quot;extropian&quot; doesn't tell anything to anyone: it's much
<br>
worse! :-)
<br>
So our intellectual contribution should go to specifying what we mean by
<br>
materialism, I don't see the need to make it a &quot;double-whammy&quot; but for those
<br>
who do, I suggest immortalist materialist (would it be presumptuous of me to
<br>
suggest my own interest, hedonist materialist wich is also an immortalism?
<br>
Probably since this list is PG-13 isn'it? :-). I'll go further (out of my
<br>
league): one who understands matter is very likely to be an immortalist so
<br>
simply claiming to be a materialist is enough to tell about one's ethics etc
<br>
Anders, I'll get 'round the rest of your interesting answer later.
