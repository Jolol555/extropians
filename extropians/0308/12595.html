<em>&gt;&gt; Wouldn't it be possible to create a quantum computer based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; spin-coupling as a communication &quot;backplane&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, you could propose such a computer.  But Robert will jump
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all over your butt for proposing &quot;magic physics&quot; on the ExI list.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, something specific without doing any actual engineering.
<br>
<p>The idea would be to use standard (fast, good, reliable, future...) 
<br>
computers to store and house and process data and use spin-coupling as 
<br>
a networking technique for messaging across the 
<br>
ultra-wide-area-network.  This ASSUMING that spin-coupling can be made 
<br>
reliable as a communication medium.
<br>
<p>It strikes me there are a few &quot;hard&quot; problems as with all 
<br>
networking-related problems 1)  interference and 2) medium 4) 
<br>
bandwidth.  I expect that interference can be overcome as a problem 
<br>
with redundancy and error-checking and such.  I expect that if you were 
<br>
to build a truly distributed machine, the nodes could be connected by 
<br>
some kind of medium at relatively short distances (say two every 100k  
<br>
Kilometers) making propagation pretty simple.  What kind of medium 
<br>
would support the interference-less communication of spin-spin 
<br>
coupled-pairs over long distances will have to be left to better 
<br>
physicists than me.  Perhaps someone who gets a free pass could jump in?
<br>
<p>Then on the client nodes you'd use something like pre-executed 
<br>
instructions (assuming that the computers you build would be faster 
<br>
than the communication medium) where you execute all the possible (or 
<br>
likely) scenarios &quot;virtually&quot; until you know which scenario is the 
<br>
actual one, commit once confirmation is received and move on.  This 
<br>
would allow relatively efficient communication method - only send the 
<br>
confirmed instruction set's signature rather than sending the whole 
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>I don't see this particular problem as technically less tractable than 
<br>
actually creating a replica of a personality in any computer AT ALL.
<br>
<p>I do see that it's likely to be very expensive and organizationally 
<br>
getting enough people together to agree that it's a good enough idea 
<br>
that they could dedicate three or four generations worth of lives to 
<br>
building such a thing sounds like the a genuinely intractable problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (The primary objection at least in my mind currently is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for QC to be useful you are going to have to propose a method
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for generating and maintaining kilo, mega, and giga amounts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of qubits.
</em><br>
<p>Storage would have to be standard, I'm only proposing a communication 
<br>
mechanism.  The problem is how to keep the nodes in sync.     If there 
<br>
is a moore's law of networking speed, then we can expect with Gigabit 
<br>
wireless over sattelite TODAY, we can expect multi-terrabyte wireless 
<br>
over stellar distances within the next 100 years or so.
