<p><em>&gt; Isn't there a difference between believing [in death]
</em><br>
<p>This sounds like the &quot;Leon Kass&quot; position -- i.e. people *should* die.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the awareness of it?
</em><br>
<p>This sounds like the everyone else who has had someone close to them die.
<br>
(Death, currently, is part of reality.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wouldn't the absence of an awareness of death seem like immortality?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, but it is hard to maintain that lack of awareness at this time
<br>
unless you are very very young.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why can't we construct a better matter transmutation?
</em><br>
<p>If I understand this statement properly, I have toyed with this idea.
<br>
It would be the ability to leave behind and make available to others
<br>
all of ones knowledge, experiences and history separately from ones spirit,
<br>
consciousness or free will.  It is kind of like bequeathing &quot;What you
<br>
are&quot; but not &quot;Who you are&quot;.  I would tend to view this as a reasonably
<br>
extropic action, particularly if the technology were available to allow
<br>
anyone to pick up the information base.  But I think that requires individuals
<br>
in an uploaded form and we don't know yet if that is really possible.
