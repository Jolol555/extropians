Damien Broderick hilariously opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;You could start with the sick and the old, kill the lot, it's cheaper and
<br>
neater and they deserve it. Retards should clearly go. Anyone in jail
<br>
should die, what have they done except leeched on the useful. Drones who
<br>
used to work before their jobs were exported should die, as Rafal remarks.
<br>
Most university staff are a dead loss with their fancy self-serving
<br>
bullshit and star-gazing. I have a little list, they never will be missed.
<br>
<p>Damien Broderick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>How come these corporate crooks who have mis-managed and cheated, are never 
<br>
considered drone-bait? Why shouldn't the US merely have Indians or Tanzanian 
<br>
bosses to lie, cheat, and mis-manage? They would do it for tens of billions less 
<br>
on their salaries and perks. :-)   Somehow the suits are always valued for 
<br>
their business-knowledge, but proggies, network engineers, office workers, and 
<br>
the like, are dregs?
<br>
<p>And, 99% of the members of the board, are merely biz school grads whose 
<br>
careers have been specialized in &quot;management&quot; or marketing, or even nowadays, Human 
<br>
Resources. The vast majority, can never claim to have started business from 
<br>
the ground up; because they are always joiners of already thriving companies. 
<br>
Enjoy the class war (low-class?) comrades, because you will be drafted to one 
<br>
side or the other, whatever your beliefs.
