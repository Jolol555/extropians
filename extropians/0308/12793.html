<p>
At the annual SIGGRAPH conference, there used to be a
<br>
large, robust SIG KIDS section, featuring actual live
<br>
kids who had done something interesting in digital
<br>
media.  As press, I spent some time interviewing these
<br>
kids and writing about what they had created.  
<br>
<p>Then, one year the SIG KIDS area, which had been open,
<br>
like all the rest of SIGGRAPH, to the general
<br>
attendees, suddenly had a literal fence around it,
<br>
with guards.  When I asked how I could enter the area
<br>
to collect material for my article, I was told simply,
<br>
&quot;you can't.  Under no circumstances will you or anyone
<br>
else be allowed to enter the area or speak with any of
<br>
the kids.&quot;
<br>
<p>It turned out, on examination, that the decision to
<br>
seal off the SIG KIDS are had been made because of
<br>
concerns that some child molestor might take advantage
<br>
of the situation - this being shortly after that
<br>
little girl was molested and killed in the bathroom in
<br>
Las Vegas.  I asked if there had been any incidents to
<br>
date at SIGGRAPH that would suggest reason for
<br>
concern, and was told, no.
<br>
<p>SIGGRAPH is a professional conference that attracts
<br>
tens of thousands of attendees from all over the
<br>
globe.  You don't get into the conference unless you
<br>
are a professional with ID, and, unless you are press
<br>
or a lecturer, etc., you pay substantial bucks as
<br>
well.  
<br>
<p>Not to say that some child molestor might not be
<br>
tempted, but there are much softer targets, I'm
<br>
certain, than SIGGRAPH, where there was constant close
<br>
adult supervision well before the fence was erected. 
<br>
The kids participating did not generally come from
<br>
some cloistered high-security paradise, either.  Prior
<br>
to and after SIGGRAPH, I'm sure that they walked
<br>
unsupervised around their neighborhoods and the local
<br>
malls, etc., where there would be long periods of time
<br>
when NO adult who knew them would be around.  
<br>
<p>These were not generally stupid kids, either, so there
<br>
was less vulnerability in that respect, and, in fact,
<br>
we know that most molestation happens at home and by
<br>
parents, relatives or people known and trusted by the
<br>
parents.  The Las Vegas incident was the bolt of
<br>
lightning out of a clear blue sky, a very rare
<br>
occurence.
<br>
<p>When I presented this to an otherwise sane friend of
<br>
mine, however, who was somewhat involved with SIGGRAPH
<br>
decision making, her response was to immediately
<br>
question my motives.  Even though she knew that I had
<br>
had years of experience working with kids in schools
<br>
and home schooling settings, and that the focus of
<br>
many of my articles was on the integration of
<br>
computers with education, the fact that I would
<br>
question these security arrangements convinced her
<br>
that I must be secretly planning some dastardly deed. 
<br>
<p>I asked her how she could possibly justify the
<br>
security arrangements, in terms of cost/benefit.  Her
<br>
response was to fly into a rage, ~&quot;I'm not going to
<br>
watch MY GRAND DAUGHTER raped and murdered in some
<br>
bathroom.  The security at SIGGRAPH even now is
<br>
minimal at best and should be increased!  EVERY person
<br>
who has anything at all to do with any child anywhere
<br>
should have a complete background check first.  (And
<br>
if you disagree, then you must be a secret molestor.)&quot;
<br>
<p>I wondered if the clerk at the local 7/11 who saw kids
<br>
on a daily basis buying snacks after school had a
<br>
complete background check first, or the paper delivery
<br>
man, or the gardener.  Maybe we should all be locked
<br>
up, given that meeting children at the library, the
<br>
mall, the theater, etc., is inevitable, until every
<br>
adult has had a thorough background check. Or, as in
<br>
the SIGGRAPH model, maybe we should just lock up all
<br>
the kids...
<br>
<p>I tried to point out that perfect safety would
<br>
literally be infinitely expensive, and putting every
<br>
cent into that kind of security would mean nothing for
<br>
medicine, medical research, safer cars.  I.e., the
<br>
cost of such draconian policies in practice would be
<br>
MORE deaths of children - a LOT more, but any question
<br>
of balance was again invariably met with a question of
<br>
motive.
<br>
<p>On a related note, a huge number of day care centers
<br>
reportedly went out of business as a consequence of
<br>
drastic increased in insurance rates after the
<br>
McMartin Preschool incident, and most people today
<br>
believe that the McMartin's were convicted.  In fact,
<br>
they were all acquited, and the ultimate resolution of
<br>
the case pointed unequivocably to the planting of
<br>
suggestions and false memories by the state
<br>
psychologist.  None of the underground tunnels in
<br>
which Satanic rituals had allegedly been conducted
<br>
were ever discovered, even though the school grounds
<br>
were thoroughly excavated, etc.  Nonetheless, the
<br>
general perception and the hysteria that followed
<br>
resulted in huge insurance hikes and also the
<br>
prosecutions of dozens of innocent people in similar
<br>
cases all over the U.S.
<br>
<p>The next year that SIGGRAPH was in L.A., there was no
<br>
SIG KIDS section.  And no raped, murdered children
<br>
there either, to be fair.  How many of the kids who
<br>
might have been there and missed out on the experience
<br>
and the development of useful life skills that kept
<br>
them alive later on in life has not been evaluated, of
<br>
course.

<p>.... Something 
<br>
is sacred when it is absolute and involable, and the
<br>
mere thought of 
<br>
trading it off for some secular value is abhorrent.
<br>
Different 
<br>
societies have different sacredness, but all societies
<br>
have it. In 
<br>
practice we always have to do trade-offs between
<br>
values. As an 
<br>
example, how much do we want to pay for road safety?
<br>
If human lives 
<br>
were infinitely valuable to us, we would gladly pay
<br>
all money we 
<br>
could for safer roads. But we actually chose (or have
<br>
someone chose 
<br>
for us) a finite amount. But actually being tempted or
<br>
forced to 
<br>
make these compromises makes us uncomfortable, and
<br>
various escape 
<br>
and coping mechanisms (such as 'moral cleansing' where
<br>
people do 
<br>
something they consider moral to balance the trade -
<br>
we feel 
<br>
contaminated by trading in the sacred). These taboo
<br>
tradeoffs cause 
<br>
strong moral outrage, especially among observers. It
<br>
is seen as 
<br>
unacceptable to trade something sacred for secular, or
<br>
even to 
<br>
consider it.
