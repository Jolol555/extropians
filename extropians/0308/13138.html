-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: matus
<br>
<p>...Jeff Davis, as I have all ready elaborated, said the 'good guys' won
<br>
in Vietnam...
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
<br>
<p><p><p>Michael, make sure you understood what (I think) Jeff was
<br>
getting at.  The west contained communism long enough for
<br>
it to collapse under its own weight.  In that sense, the
<br>
good guys did win in Vietnam, setting the stage for the
<br>
eventual victory of WW3, which petered out around 1990.
<br>
<p>Sure there are some communist nations left, no-count
<br>
basket cases like Cuba and North Korea, and of course
<br>
the die-hard biggie China, but its only a matter of 
<br>
time before these collapse too.  Few who have access 
<br>
to information on this planet still think Marx was right.
<br>
China cannot keep the internet out forever.  
<br>
<p>In the end, every life lost in Vietnam on both sides
<br>
demonstrated to the communists that they would 
<br>
have to fight for every step to world dominion.  This 
<br>
they could not do, but the damage they did in the 
<br>
attempt was appalling.  In the end, one could
<br>
argue the good guys did eventually win WW3, with
<br>
the battle of Vietnam being one stop along the way.
<br>
<p>Had not the U.S. demonstrated to the world that we
<br>
would fight in Korea and Vietnam, most nations would 
<br>
not have attempted to resist the red tide.  Our 
<br>
entire planet today would be cold, hungry, gray,
<br>
driving Trabis or worse, choking in smog, listless,
<br>
everyone EQUALLY poor and dispirited, infrastructure
<br>
crumbling and no one caring since there would be no 
<br>
profit in actually doing anything, going thru our 
<br>
phony workdays like zombies, waiting for the 4 oclock
<br>
whistle so we could go home and drown our sorrows
<br>
in cheap vodka.  It would be a planet of Albania.
<br>
<p>Indeed, the good guys did win in Vietnam, eventually.
