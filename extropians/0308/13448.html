<em>&gt; If a permanent member of the security council commits

</em><br>
<em>&gt; military response, and the appropriate protocol is 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; there any way for the UN to get around the veto power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the offending member? 
</em><br>
<p>There is *no* charter-authorised military response against
<br>
a veto holding permanent security council member *unless*
<br>
that country does not exercise its veto in its own defence. 
<br>
<p>It would be effectively impossible under the UN charter 
<br>
to invade any of the big 5 as they would veto it. Any
<br>
invasion even legitimate (morally) would break the charter.
<br>
(Please note I am not saying that there are no circumstances
<br>
where the Charter should not be revoked. Indeed I think
<br>
any country could (with morality and honor) unilaterally 
<br>
withdraw from the Charter if they stated that in their view 
<br>
the UN was unable to achieve its purpose under article 1
<br>
which is to maintain international peace and security.
<br>
- but that is a personal opinion based on logic and philosophy
<br>
not law.) There is no higher international law than the UN 
<br>
charter where it has jurisdiction (which is *not* everywhere,
<br>
eg. it does not have jurisdiction in domestic matters -such 
<br>
as stonings), the signatories to the charter itself agreed to
<br>
this in the charter.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Or to put it another way, does the law not apply (as in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;above the law&quot;) to permanent members of the UNSC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; council?
</em><br>
<p>Not in the conventional sense. The UNSC is the highest
<br>
authority in UN. It is the force behind the UN and behind 
<br>
the UN World Court. There is no action that can be taken
<br>
against a UNSC member veto and still be a legitimate UN
<br>
action. Period. That is the strength and perhaps the 
<br>
weakness of the UN as it is currently configured by its 
<br>
present Charter.
<br>
<p>Its a strength because its disperses the power of the UN
<br>
across 5 strong countries rather than just say one or two.
<br>
If China, Russia, the UK, the US, and France are in agreement
<br>
that's not a bad indication that something is geneuinely widely
<br>
supported in the world community and that was the case
<br>
with resolution 1441 relating to Iraq.
<br>
<p>Its a weakness because when any of these 5 are themselves
<br>
playing up or violating the charter there is no mechanism
<br>
within the charter to expell them (because they can veto
<br>
their expulsion) and there is no force that can be legally
<br>
assembled to oppose them (as they would of course
<br>
veto the formulation of such a force). Much of the 
<br>
historic disastisfaction with the UN and its preceived
<br>
inconsistencies go back to that much misunderstood 
<br>
veto power of the big 5. The 5 victors of WW11.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One possible work-around that comes to mind is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any act of such nature as to justify military 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;correction&quot; by the UN would likely also be a charter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violation, and as such 'nullify' a state's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; membership/voting privileges.  
</em><br>
<p>Not clear what you mean here. Under article 51 any
<br>
country can defend itself against aggression until such
<br>
time as the UN gets involved. On this basis the pursuit
<br>
of the September 11 terrorists into Afghanistan would 
<br>
have been lawful in my opinion though a bit of a stretch.
<br>
<p>And the UN may not get involved if one of the UNSC
<br>
members vetos involvement.
<br>
<p>What made 1441 special was the US a permanent member
<br>
got the UN involved with Iraq and thereby waived any 
<br>
right it might have to attack Iraq on exactly the same 
<br>
grounds as the UN was considering action against Iraq.
<br>
The US, in my opinion, tried to do the right thing and
<br>
breath life into the UNSC and act lawfully. But in doing
<br>
so they went where they had never been before. They
<br>
put themselves, and their sovereignty in respect to one
<br>
particular domain under the UNSC voluntarily. Then they
<br>
stepped out when they didn't like the outcome. The stepping
<br>
out was unprecedented. A fabric of legal nonsense was
<br>
erected to try and avoid the perception that the stepping
<br>
out and acting without UNSC approval was not a breach.
<br>
It was a breach. But the breach ironically would not have
<br>
been a breach (or at least not a breach of such serious and
<br>
unprecedented consequences - a charter breaker if you will)
<br>
had the US not at some point been genuinely trying in good
<br>
faith to breath life into the UN. There is some tragedy there
<br>
(and for the US as well). The diplomatic failure was avoidable. 
<br>
Simple, but serious human error, (Bush's), at the highest level,
<br>
not malice in my view, brought about the current dispensation
<br>
where all international law is farce. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
