<em>&gt; &gt; There is more than a little material out there that his administration
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; in

<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; works.    But in any case his administration has actively suppressed full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impartial investigation into much of 9/11.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a matter of hindsight being 20/20. The government cannot protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone from a single nut or a bunch of fruitcakes that decide to murder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. Any belief otherwise is simply a false sense of security. Freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a double-edged sword. They may have made mistakes, but they are human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and do make them occasionally. We all do. I think this would be a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem in any admistration, not just Bush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The case is a lot stronger than hindsight being 20/20.  Why exactly would his 
<br>
administration purposefully thwart a full public investigation of 9/11?   
<br>
This doesn't make a lot of sense to me unless there is something highly 
<br>
untoward or embarrassing.   The &quot;national security&quot; dodge doesn't cut it as 
<br>
it isn't that difficult to do a satisfactory public report that does not 
<br>
expose critical information about our intelligence and counter-terrorism 
<br>
abilities.  
<br>
<p>Bush and company not only made mistakes but are working diligently to not let 
<br>
them come to light.  So much so they are eviscerating normal review process, 
<br>
FOIA, and other checks.    This is out of order for any American 
<br>
administration and must stop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can hardly say we are spent into oblivion. We are here. The 1980s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showed that we can function quite fine with deficits and debt. But yes, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do agree with your point that it has had little affect and as such hasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been a smart thing to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, I wish to hell we had only as much national debt and only as large 
<br>
deficits as we had in the 80s!   It was pretty damn obvious going in that 
<br>
Iraq did not make a lot of sense.  Afghanistan could &quot;almost&quot; be excused as 
<br>
reaction.   But there is no sign we have really learned at the official 
<br>
level.  What very expensive stupidity will it be next that we do that we 
<br>
later excuse as &quot;just being human&quot; and making mistakes?  Of course Iraq never 
<br>
was about WMD and certainly was never about freeing the Iraqi people from 
<br>
Saddam.   The most rational explanation (I am not fully sure this 
<br>
administration deserves that much benefit of the doubt) is that we greatly 
<br>
fear the coming blow-up of Saudi Arabia and what it will do to utterly 
<br>
devastate our economy.  So we needed a reason to grab some fall back reserves 
<br>
and to set up a strong military presence next door.    It would be nice if 
<br>
they just said so next time instead of causing so many people to turn 
<br>
themselves into intellectual pretzels attempting to buy or deny the official 
<br>
story at face value.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not a big fan of Bush, especially the way he invokes &quot;God&quot; at every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; opportunity, but I think that this &quot;resume&quot; is rather juvenile and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; serves to polarize those that already dislike him. The President only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; what he thinks he needs to do to get re-elected. That's the way the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; was set up. To fix our problems, we need to change the way the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; think, not sit around and complain about our leaders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually it is not at all 'juvenile'.  What is juvenile at best is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refusing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wake up and smell the coffeee.  It goes far beyond &quot;dislike&quot;.  The man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and his administration have objectively done much that lead to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable conclusion of that they are a tremendous menace to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; country, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and to all our fondest extropic goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree. I don't see them as a tremendous menace. More like a thorn in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my side. They are pretty much like the others before them. 
</em><br>
<p>Then watch and learn.  I hope you learn quickly enough to make a bit of a 
<br>
difference.   This administration is cashin in on a lot that has gone before 
<br>
plus 9/11 in order to take the gloves off and do publicly much that would 
<br>
never have been tolerated eariler.  The menace is both what they have already 
<br>
done, overtly and covertly AND what the next group in power will do starting 
<br>
from that base.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; menaces, an educatinal system that fails to educate and a religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority. Until these are fixed, our leaders will continue to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions that hurt us. And they won;t &quot;fix&quot; these because that is where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their power comes from. It has to come from us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree very much that those in power want and need unthinking and religious 
<br>
excuses for unthinking.   But we need to expose what they want to use these 
<br>
blank checks for in order to stop them.  Until we do we will not be able to 
<br>
turn the unthinking ignorance around.   It takes time to train minds, time to 
<br>
eschew the poor programming we ourselves have suffered and reprogram.   I 
<br>
doubt we have enough time for this effort alone to be sufficient.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; How do you &quot;fix how people think&quot; without putting out viewpoints such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one you just called &quot;juvenile&quot;.  It was intended to get people to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK. If that was the intention, I'll grant that. It just seemed to me to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of a superficial attack rather than an informative piece. It doesn;t
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get into the details very much.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think it was meant as a summation.  Most people do not have that long of an 
<br>
attention span.  They forget parts of the pattern and how and when many 
<br>
things became as they are today.   They hear the current soundbites and do 
<br>
the predicatable reactions as planned to those soundbites.
