<em>&gt; &gt; I have generally tended to agree with Lee's previous statement that we

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But there is another alternative that I don't remember anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mentioning. Look around you. Old folk with a good pension or a pile of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assets don't do much. Sitting on your porch in a rocking chair seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like a good deal to them. It is the young who haven't made their pile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who rush around 'doing' things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's most likely there are &quot;old folk&quot; out there who's activities are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inscrutable and invisible to us, but rather than existing sedately I expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're experiencing life at a level of complexity and meaning beyond our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current comprehension.
</em><br>
<p>And just why aren't they using the energy available in our solar system?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly it amazes me when people talk about vastly extending their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities and longevity but then imagine that they would then pursue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their current hedonistic goals (or maybe just one copy to this).
</em><br>
<p>All things can be concurrently achieved once you give up having to
<br>
be in only one place at a time. (Yes, some of my current hedonistic
<br>
activities I'd replace with more refined means of gratification.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even the idea of boundless physical expansion, while possessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a certain mathematical symmetry, I think is based on our evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive for procreation and won't match posthuman values.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, perhaps there is some sort of instinct to &quot;breed abundantly
<br>
in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth&quot; that
<br>
evolved. But why should that be inimical to our posthuman values?
<br>
<p>For one thing, is not appealing to bring life to the outer reaches
<br>
of the universe?  Why should matter not be rescued from its currently
<br>
dead state almost everywhere?
<br>
<p>But an even stronger argument is this: it takes only *one* posthuman
<br>
civilization---or perhaps only one sufficiently advanced posthuman---
<br>
to colonize the rest of the universe.  Why is it so alluring to so
<br>
many people to imagine that somehow all posthuman value systems will
<br>
universally turn up their noses at this?  Especially when the ends
<br>
are so noble?
