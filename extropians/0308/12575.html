<p><p>Bush Impeached? Wanna Bet?
<br>
<p>By Leander Kahney
<br>
<p>02:00 AM Aug. 04, 2003 PT
<br>
<p>Though there was an outcry over the Pentagon's terrorism futures market, a
<br>
similar online exchange is in the works to predict what the U.S. government
<br>
is up to.
<br>
<p>The American Action Market will offer various Washington &quot;futures&quot; that can
<br>
be bet upon and traded. Examples include:
<br>
<p><p>* Which country will the White House threaten next?
<br>
<p>* Who will be the next foreign leader to move off the CIA payroll and
<br>
onto the White House's &quot;most wanted&quot; list?
<br>
<p>* Which corporation with close ties to the White House will be the next
<br>
cloaked in scandal?
<br>
<p>The AAM will begin registering traders in September and plans to open for
<br>
business Oct. 1 -- the same launch date proposed for the Pentagon's
<br>
terrorism market, until it was shelved.
<br>
<p>Like the Pentagon's scrapped Policy Analysis Market, the AAM lets traders
<br>
&quot;bet&quot; on future events by buying and selling futures as though they were
<br>
stocks. The higher the price, the more likely the market believes the event
<br>
will occur. But instead of predicting terrorist strikes, the AAM will
<br>
predict things like the next White House staffer to quit.
<br>
<p>&quot;The idea is to answer some of the most pressing questions in the world:
<br>
What will the White House do next?&quot; said one of the founders, Andrew Geiger,
<br>
an American programmer living in Paris.
<br>
<p>The AAM market is the brainchild of a half-dozen academics from various
<br>
colleges, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale
<br>
University, New York University and the University of Montreal. Most,
<br>
however, are keeping their identities quiet until they get an institutional
<br>
go-ahead.
<br>
<p>The market was organized on Nettime, a politics and culture mailing list.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's quite amazing, the Pentagon and the White House are very fertile
<br>
imaginative fields these days,&quot; Geiger said. &quot;(The AAM project) sounds
<br>
humorous, but that just shows how far things have gone. We've entered the
<br>
realm of fiction. Things really are Dr. Strangelove.&quot;
<br>
<p>The AAM project complements another academic project, the Government
<br>
Information Awareness project. The GIA was built in response to the Defense
<br>
Advanced Research Projects Agency's Terrorism Information Awareness program.
<br>
<p>Its organizers hope the market will attract academics, politicians, civil
<br>
servants and other insiders to provide accurate predictions of White House
<br>
behavior. Geiger said even those who read the newspapers are qualified to be
<br>
traders.
<br>
<p>&quot;Our goal is to have people with insight into how the White House works,&quot;
<br>
said Geiger. &quot;There are a lot of people who spend a lot of time thinking
<br>
about what's going on in the world these days. A lot of that thought could
<br>
be transferred into the system, giving you trading data that will tell you
<br>
what's really going on.&quot;
<br>
<p>Geiger added, &quot;Who knows whether it will reveal stuff? Anyway, it will be
<br>
engaging.&quot;
<br>
<p>The public, he noted, will be able to follow trades on the market's website.
<br>
<p>David Pennock, a senior research scientist at Overture Services, said
<br>
futures markets have proven to be very good predictors of many different
<br>
kinds of events, from the weather to election outcomes.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's one of the best, if not the best, way to predict the future,&quot; he said.
<br>
&quot;It's a good, well-known method for getting information that's distributed
<br>
around the world.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bob Forsythe, a University of Iowa professor who helped organize the Iowa
<br>
Electronic Markets, which speculate on election results, agreed that futures
<br>
are reliable indicators of what's going to happen next -- if the traders are
<br>
knowledgeable.
<br>
<p>&quot;You have to have informed traders or they don't work very well,&quot; he said.
<br>
&quot;Who are the informed traders in an assassination market, for example? The
<br>
same's true for predicting the White House.&quot;
<br>
