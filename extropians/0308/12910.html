<em>&gt; &gt; How about if you and I and several other business partners develop a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; product, then you turn around and sell the trade secrets relating to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the product to a competitor. You make out big time and I lose out big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time. Oh wait, I forgot-- because the competitor did not have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spend the money and time to develop the product (just the money he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gave you), he can sell the product more cheaply than our company
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have.  Less development expenses, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And now, you say, in reply, I (and the other partners) can buy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; product more cheaply than before. If I can make enough at Walmart to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; buy the product, of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gee, business partner, please don't do me any more &quot;favors.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, not to put too fine a point (guess I do have to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that...), as an analogy, we Americans and our ancestors built this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; country into a place with tremendous competitive advantages: we as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; voters control and have exclusive labor market access to the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consumer market ever.  That means that we can charge far more when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sell our labor here in the USA to labor buyers who want to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; products to this enormous consumer market.  Compare to third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worlders, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### So where is the analogy? You are one of the Founders? You built this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country? You hammered the nails in the Transcontinental Railway?
</em><br>
<p>I and my ancestors helped build and defend this country.  All citizens 
<br>
are &quot;owners.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nah, the analogy goes like this - you are a junior partner, who wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take over the firm built by generations, stop hiring workers who are cheaper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maybe better than him, and wants to get paid by seniority instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real work.
</em><br>
<p><p>Some animals are more equal than others, huh? Sorry, bud. This is America. 
<br>
All American CITIZENS are equal with respect to the constitution.  Maybe you 
<br>
want to move to a country where Investors and Entrepreneurs are elevated as 
<br>
demigods above the hoi polloi. Oops, that's right--neoconservative propaganda 
<br>
is already well on its way to making America into just that.
