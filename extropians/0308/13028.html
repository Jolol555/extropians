Alex Bokov:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Thanks for your advice, but I think I was misunderstood.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to convert the non life-extensionists... our relationship with
<br>
them here is a low-key, productive detente.
<br>
<p>I'm trying to keep the life-extensionist guys from blowing the roof off and
<br>
exposing us all to unwanted scrutiny prematurely.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Say: &quot;Not everyone will see it your way, in fact most of the people you meet, 
<br>
will not; because of cultural brain-washing, or misplaced skepticism.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is true. I would also suggest appealing to their ego, Alex. Why? Because 
<br>
usually, of the persons you are referring to are either inexperienced 
<br>
socially, or are running on 110% ego, or both. So perhaps tell them; &quot;Not everyone is 
<br>
as insightful and gifted as you are, they cannot see beyond tomorrow night, 
<br>
but you can!&quot;  In other words appeal to their ego, in order to placate them. 
<br>
Their views are validated, and maybe they are persuaded to clam up for a while 
<br>
:-D ......Maybe.  
<br>
<p>Add: &quot;Yes, we have our work cut out for us, but as of now, we can only 
<br>
persuade one person at a time, so we have to be cautious!&quot;
<br>
<p>On the other hand, Alex, some people are just schmucks who have all the charm 
<br>
of a warthog in heat, so maybe ditching them is the answer...Muah hah hah 
<br>
hah! Suggest that they go join the Wiccans, because man, its Babe-City!  A brainy 
<br>
guy like you will get laid, every night like a carpet! Woo Hoo!&quot; Make it 
<br>
think its their idea. 
<br>
<p>Machiavelli, is there no end to His teachings? (blink-blink)
