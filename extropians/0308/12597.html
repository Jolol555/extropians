</em><br>
<p>There is no known such information transmission effect. But I hope we 
<br>
can squeeze something out of quantum gravity (if spacetime on the Planck 
<br>
scale is filled with wormholes, there ought to exist shortcuts for 
<br>
communication - but I fear there might be probabilistic laws showing 
<br>
that you cannot on average send information faster than light). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If you were discussing using them as q-bits,  ... well, I 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication links.   The estimates that I've seen as to how capable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would be make me rank them as &quot;Don't try to think past this until 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering contraints are more obvious.&quot;  32-qbits would be, O, 32 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms (plus, of course, a whole lot of support equipment, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refridgerators, etc.).  And large classes of problems would disolve into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;trivially solved&quot;.    Large classes.  And this change could come *quickly*.
</em><br>
<p>We are already moving towards larger and larger quantum computing
<br>
systems. In general N qubits are worth 2^N ordinary bits, *but it
<br>
depends on the problem class*. I don't think large classes of problems
<br>
will trivially fold; we have had quantum computer theory for several
<br>
years now, and Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search algorithm
<br>
still seem to be the most useful ones found. I doubt one could do (say)
<br>
a chess algorithm this way. But we don't need large classes of 
<br>
algorithms to be speeded up, just some essential classes we can build 
<br>
computers on top of. Imagine a quantum algorithm that can act as a 
<br>
general but fast Turing machine - that would be revolutionary!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Yes, but this is based on FTL communication, not entanglement. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we can make small wormholes this might work. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does one get the negative energy density to stabilize them?
</em><br>
<p>Beats me, but I would take a look at the Casimir effect. It is IMHO the 
<br>
only macroscopic negative energy effect I know. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel realtively confident that wormhole 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicaitons will always be expensive.  But it might have a very fast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit rate.  (Would a high speed laser link cause problems with keeping up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the needed negative engery gradient?  I don't know the rules here.)
</em><br>
<p>If you pass too much mass/energy across, you get problems. My 
<br>
calculations (<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume5/Brains2.pdf">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume5/Brains2.pdf</a>)  said 
<br>
that a one meter diameter wormhole has a max capacity of 1.56e87 bits/s, 
<br>
and a nanometer wormhole 1.56e69 bits/s. Quite a good bandwidth. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many people understand a lot more about it than I do.  I'm basically a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmer.  And, I must admit, cryptography doesn't interest me.   My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding is more at the level of Scientific American and Science 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; News.  So I know the general outlines of current beliefs on, say, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entanglement, but not the details or the certainty.  I do, however, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember the absolute confidence that I heard given to sentences like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We'll never be able to see a single atom.  Quantuum theory forbids 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.&quot;  Which is sort of true...but not really, as quantuum dots and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scanning Electron Microscope showed.  The math was solid, but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translation into physical models was flawed.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. A lot of stuff gets said with absolute certainty that shouldn't be 
<br>
said that way. On the other hand, much is said in a doubtful way when it 
<br>
should be said certainly.
<br>
<p>My personal rule is to avoid assuming stuff that would be better than 
<br>
current physics allows, or when you do it clearly mark it as wishful 
<br>
thinking.
