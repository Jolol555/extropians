Carried to its inevitable consequence all the land is owned by a few very     
<br>
rich people who literally can deny life to the remaining population. For an   
<br>
in-depth exploration of one way to solve this pop over to www.henrygeorge.org 
<br>
and do some reading.

<p><p>Wow! Never thought I'd see tax scheme I don't find completely abhorrent. This
<br>
actually offers a handy way out for a number of dilemmas. Something to keep
<br>
in mind for a community living in an artificial environment-- a space station
<br>
or human-made island for example. In that case, whoever built the place is
<br>
really is the landlord and the government, and just charges everyone rent
<br>
directly. What tennants do on their rental property is then completely their
<br>
business, modulo a few common-sense rules embedded in their lease intended
<br>
to prevent violence/exploitation/coercion of fellow tennants and damage to
<br>
the space they are renting. To guard against abuse of power, the owner entity
<br>
could be organized as a cooperative where every tennant buys into an equal
<br>
number of shares upon moving in.
<br>
<p>It's also interesting to think about what would happen if it was applied to
<br>
Anarchitect's contract-based plan for bootstrapping a Libertarian non-state
<br>
from within a non-Libertarian state. That plan seemed to keep struggling with
<br>
how to guarantee inalienable rights despite there being no collective property
<br>
or public employees whatsoever... if one were to add the observation that
<br>
land is qualitatively different from all other types of property, that might
<br>
simplify the whole thing and make the elaborate Free Zones unnecessary.
<br>
<p>The Libertarian state plan I'm referring to above used to be on
<br>
<a href="http://www31.brinkster.com/anarchitect/">http://www31.brinkster.com/anarchitect/</a> but it's gone now, and my
<br>
repost of it to this list has also vanished (it used to be here--

<br>
If you have a mirror or an archived copy of that posting, I hope you repost
<br>
it.
