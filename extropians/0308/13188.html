<p>His position is that the hawkish US foreign policy along with 
<br>
oligarchical political and economic rules since the turn of the century 
<br>
have been leading to continual degradation in the quality of living for 
<br>
actual Americans as well as contributing to terror, despotism and 
<br>
mayhem worldwide.  I take it for the most part these observations are 
<br>
undisputed.  Now two family members must work to support a family of 
<br>
four.  Then only 1. Then, you could pay for a piece of land capable of 
<br>
sustaining your own family within 7 years by working.  NOW you're lucky 
<br>
to be able to afford a house within 30 years and THEN can expect to 
<br>
still have to work to pay for food and water.
<br>
<p>As for despotic regimes sponsored by the US, the list of them is 
<br>
readily available, but the big names that come to mind are the obvious 
<br>
ones from your list - the Taliban, the Ayatolah, Saddam, Pol Pot, etc.
<br>
<p>That's not &quot;everything the US has done is absolutely evil&quot; BUT it sure 
<br>
has done a lot of bad stuff.
<br>
<p>Simply recognizing this along with the good makes a &quot;fair and balanced&quot; 
<br>
judgement of the moral stature of the US as a nation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear nothing but criticisms, what evidence do we have to suggest that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have anything to say other than criticisms?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I for one absolutely love In-N-Out (despite their obvious 
<br>
anti-extropian offerings - like french fries).  Family owned and 
<br>
operated, good business, fair prices, pay people pretty well, allow 
<br>
advancement from within, etc.  They don't buy &quot;near-slave&quot; labor from 
<br>
other countries and, I'm told, are nice people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I could live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere I wanted, Id probably first pick Hong Kong (but would end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving soon as the Chinese took control again) second would be a close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runner up between the US and Australia.
</em><br>
<p>But this is really a veiled &quot;Love it or leave it&quot; argument, isn't it?  
<br>
The implication is &quot;The US is better than every other country on earth 
<br>
so stop complaining.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  As noted,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma, East Timor, North Korea etc. for a total of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 17
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries had NO data present to compare.  Yet the CS Monitor did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find this noteworthy enough to even mention in their article.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have read &quot;US has highest incarceration rate of the countries who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell us theirs, the notoriously worse countries incarceration rates are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknown&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You're right, the most despotic regimes are not listed there but is 
<br>
that supposed to make us feel better that we Jail people at a higher 
<br>
rate than all the rest of the &quot;civilized&quot; world?
<br>
