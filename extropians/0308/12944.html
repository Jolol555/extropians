Hi all,
<br>
<p>I received the following request to sign a petition aimed at 
<br>
preventing the stoning of a Nigerian woman for adultery. 
<br>
Apparently a similar petition has been successful before. 
<br>
<p>I have signed it but I am not going to forward it as it 
<br>
requests to people in my address book because I 
<br>
don't know that to do so would not be exposing them to
<br>
an email spamming scam.
<br>
<p>Here's the quandry. 
<br>
<p>(1) This seems like a very worth while petition to sign if 
<br>
something so easy to do can have such a positive outcome
<br>
and the technique could be used elesewhere.
<br>
<p>But.
<br>
<p>(2) Can someone with the tech knowledge please advise
<br>
on the safety of forwarding it? It asks for an email address
<br>
at the point of signing. Possibly that is the real danger point
<br>
where people would be exposing themselves to spammers
<br>
when trying to do something humane.
<br>
<p>Its annoying, but it seems to me that it would be easy for
<br>
scammers (who'd be spammers) to use just such a tool.

<p><em>&gt;Hearing on AMINA LAWAL SET TO BE STONED ON
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - 27 AUGUST 2003
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;  The Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the death
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;sentence for Amina Lawal, condemned for the crime of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;adultery on August 19th 2002, to be buried up to her
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;neck and stoned to death. Her death was postponed so
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;that she could continue to nurse her baby. Hearing on
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;her Execution is now set for 27 AUGUST 2003.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;If you haven't been following this case, you might
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;like to know that Amina's baby is regarded as the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;'evidence' of her adultery.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Amina's case is being handled by the Spanish branch of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Amnesty International, which is attempting to put
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;together enough signatures to make the Nigerian
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;government rescind the death sentence. A similar
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;campaign saved another Nigerian woman, Safiya,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;condemned in similar circumstances. By March 4th the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;petition had amassed over 2,600,000 signatures. It
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;will only take you a few seconds to sign Amnesty's
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;online petition. Please sign the petition now, then
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;copy this message into a new email and send it to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;everyone in your address book.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Go to the web page
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;      <a href="http://www.amnesty.org.au/e-card/petition.asp">http://www.amnesty.org.au/e-card/petition.asp</a>
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;Thanks for reading this. Please take the time to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;sign the petition...
