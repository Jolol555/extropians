Ok, I'm going to see if I can take this thread in a slightly different
<br>
direction.

<p>Sounds like this prevents one from lobbying to repeal the PA or parts thereof.
<br>
<p>Now *that* is a pretty slick piece of legislation -- who the hell drafted
<br>
this thing -- Ashcroft &amp; Co.?  If so they are bad/evil people.  It goes
<br>
against the fundamental principles the country was built upon -- the Minutemen,
<br>
Paul Revere's efforts (one if by land, two if by sea), Freedom of Speech, etc.
<br>
I'm sure Greg could comment on what components of Jefferson's or Franklin's
<br>
perspectives this violates (at length).  It would seem to allow taking every
<br>
demonstrator who demonstrated against the WTO a couple of years ago in Seattle
<br>
and hauling them off to jail.  They *clearly* were &quot;conspiring&quot; to
<br>
disobey &quot;laws&quot; of the U.S. (though I'm not clear if that phrase would
<br>
or would not include state laws).
<br>
<p>Also, to put a transhumanist spin on this, it would seem to make it illegal
<br>
for American citizens to lobby for independent enclaves within the
<br>
U.S. or promoting the formation external enclaves (e.g. nanotech island based)
<br>
that might threaten the economic interests of the U.S. -- [if government officials
<br>
can't get paid its a bit difficult for them to &quot;execute their duty&quot;.]
<br>
<p>What a mess.
<br>
<p>R.
