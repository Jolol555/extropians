</em><br>
<p>As far as we know, every new thing humans do has never happened before
<br>
in the history of the universe.  More below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any civilization is a product of its past history. An immortal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Z-strategy post-singularity civilization will be master of its local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment and using intelligence beyond our understanding to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a long history of seeking very low reproductive rates before it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gained access to very large (possibly unlimited) resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The r-strategy populations that maximise reproduction in our world are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all natural evolution cases where suddenly an abundance of food becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available. The post-singularity civilization is consciously controlling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its own evolution. Big difference!
</em><br>
<p>I think the problem is that we've been discussing &quot;a civilization&quot; as
<br>
if that term meant a thing, more-or-less indivisible, like a person.
<br>
<p>I don't think it's meaningful to talk about actions or motives of
<br>
groups, but it's convenient shorthand for &quot;most members of&quot;.  Of course,
<br>
using that shorthand leads to an evitable argument between those who
<br>
just use it as shorthand, and those who've internalized a concept of
<br>
group-as-thing.
<br>
<p>Basically, I think you're begging the question when you assume that
<br>
a &quot;post-singularity civilization [...] consciously controlling&quot; itself
<br>
is possible without that &quot;civilization&quot; being a single person.
<br>
<p>So let me qualify this to say that any civilization which is not 
<br>
actually
<br>
a single person cannot control its own change.  So if we're discussing
<br>
groups which have an internal governance that is so absolutely 
<br>
totalitarian
<br>
that they can, for a time, control rate and direction of change, I would
<br>
say that I don't expect groups like that to last long.  My guess is that
<br>
dystopias of control like this have a lifetime which is loosely 
<br>
inversely
<br>
correlated to how complete the control is.
<br>
<p><p>There's a whole 'nother problem with your statement, in my opinion.  Let
<br>
me repeat part of that statement here so that I don't go off-track:
<br>
<em>&gt; An immortal Z-strategy post-singularity civilization will be master of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its local environment and using intelligence beyond our understanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control its own evolution.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution, I submit, is meaningless in the context of a single entity.  
<br>
In
<br>
that case, change is merely change.  Evolution is something that happens
<br>
with competing entities.  (Seems trivial, I know).  Applying that to our
<br>
discussion, when I talk about evolution of civilizations, I don't mean
<br>
change within a civilization.  I've mentioned why I don't expect there
<br>
to be only one civilization, above, so the only remaining objection is
<br>
if there is some universal reason why propagation or expansion results 
<br>
in
<br>
*less* of the entity or group expanding.
<br>
<p>This may not be as verbose as it could be.  If it doesn't seem to make
<br>
sense, let me know and I'll try to unpack it.
