<p><p>The Big Ideas of Robin Hanson
<br>
<p>In the background of the Pentagon's controversial-and now defunct-plan
<br>
to create a futures market to predict terrorist strikes is a
<br>
little-known George Mason University economist named Robin Hanson.
<br>
Little known, that is, among those who view economists as little more
<br>
than number crunchers whose main job it is to provide those usually
<br>
dodgy estimates of what the economy's growth or unemployment rate is
<br>
likely to be in some future quarter. 
<br>
<p>But for those who have an interest in what life might be like if we
<br>
lived in a Matrix-like computer simulation or how superintelligent
<br>
computers could someday affect economic growth, Hanson is as hot as they
<br>
come. His work on information markets-markets where &quot;investors&quot; make
<br>
bets on the likelihood of certain future events-was critical to the
<br>
development of the terrorism futures market, formally called the Policy
<br>
Analysis Market, which was funded by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced
<br>
Research Projects Agency. 
<br>
<p>Although Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz described the effort as
<br>
&quot;too imaginative,&quot; it really pales by comparison to some of the other
<br>
creative thoughts bouncing around Hanson's noggin-which shouldn't be
<br>
surprising for a guy who says he'd &quot;love to specialize in the economics
<br>
of science fiction.&quot; Among the treats on his home page are his &quot;14 Wild
<br>
Ideas.&quot; Hanson says up to a third of them may actually be true-though,
<br>
maddeningly, he doesn't specify which ones. Here are a few:
<br>
<p>By 2100, the vast majority of &quot;people&quot; will be immortal computers
<br>
running brain simulations. &quot;Simulated brains are potentially immortal,
<br>
just as all computer data is. And the ability to cheaply simulate brains
<br>
will revolutionize labor economics; wages should fall to near the cost
<br>
of making brain simulators. The population of such 'uploads' should
<br>
expand very rapidly, allowing huge increases in both economic growth
<br>
rates and inequality.&quot;
<br>
<p>If medicine were taxed so much that people only bought half as much,
<br>
they would be just as healthy. &quot;In the 1970s, the Rand Health Insurance
<br>
Experiment randomly assigned 5,000 adults to free or full-price
<br>
healthcare over 3-5 years. Free-care folks got more eyeglasses and teeth
<br>
filled, and spent about 30 percent more, but were otherwise no
<br>
healthier. . . . I'm willing to extrapolate from this 30 percent change
<br>
to a 50 percent cut.&quot;
<br>
<p>There's a chance that Hanson himself lives in a &quot;future&quot; computer
<br>
simulation. &quot;Some uploads [people who have uploaded their brains into
<br>
computers] could have robot bodies, while others could live in simulated
<br>
computer worlds. Our descendants may place some of them in historical
<br>
simulations, with simulated people who do not realize that they are
<br>
simulated. How sure can I be now that I do not live in a future
<br>
historical simulation?&quot;
<br>
<p>Visitors to Hanson's Web site will find plenty of academic papers
<br>
supporting these and other notions, including his belief that all major
<br>
government policies should be determined by betting markets such as the
<br>
Policy Analysis Market.
<br>
<p>Now given Hanson's areas of interest, I thought he would be the perfect
<br>
guy to comment on a prediction that's been crawling around the Web in
<br>
recent days. Marshall Brain, the founder of HowStuffWorks, recently
<br>
published an essay in which he predicts that advances in artificial
<br>
intelligence and robotics will result in smart machines taking half the
<br>
jobs in the United States by 2050. Hanson's take on the forecast?
<br>
<p>&quot;His predictions about future progress in robotic technology are not
<br>
crazy, even if they are not assured. He ignores the software
<br>
problem-even if robots have more computing power than the brain, it may
<br>
take a while for software to be good enough. But it is not crazy to
<br>
think the software problem might be solved within a decade or two of
<br>
when we have enough hardware. His social predictions are more of a mixed
<br>
bag. . . . For example, he doesn't consider that people who leave some
<br>
jobs might find others. Automation has taken away most farming jobs, but
<br>
that hasn't made most people unemployed; people now do other things that
<br>
they do better than machines. . . . However, a closer examination does,
<br>
I think, suggest that eventually machines will become mostly substitutes
<br>
for, rather than complements of, human labor.&quot;
<br>
<p>As Hanson continues to creatively cogitate, I'll let you know what he
<br>
comes up with.
