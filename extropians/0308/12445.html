</em><br>
<p>Frankly, a little objective research changes lots of minds from your
<br>
side of the pond.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, I agree that the actions of our domestic governments under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the banner of fighting terrorism pose more of a threat than does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism itself. Although I'm sure they have must have secret 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise, how could they sleep at night?
</em><br>
<p>That was not my conclusion. My conclusion was that the very REAL
<br>
threats and risks of terrorism (and the damage it does, counting in the
<br>
thousands of lives and many hundreds of billions of dollars) are a
<br>
better insurance for the ruling parties to retain leadership than the
<br>
Soviet Union ever was. Who wants to risk voting in some unknown freaky
<br>
third party candidate when we have a 'war' to run?
<br>
<p>So there is a vested interest in maintaining the sort of conditions
<br>
that give rise to anti-US organizations of militant or non-militant
<br>
bent, just as the anti-Catholic groups in northern Ireland have a
<br>
vested interest in maintaining repression of Catholics that help
<br>
recruiting for the IRA, the anti-nuke groups have a vested interest in
<br>
fighting against resolution of the nuclear waste issue via either
<br>
breeder reactors or long term storage facilities, etc.
<br>
<p>Similarly, many other nations ruling parties have a vested interest in
<br>
using an anti-US position and anti-US propaganda to maintain their own
<br>
grips on power.
<br>
<p>Zero-sum games are not yet obsolete, despite the claims of many on this
<br>
list. While they don't work well in economics, they are quite fine in
<br>
politics, where you can't quantify things so well, so it's much easier
<br>
to smoke over an issue with lies and deflection.
