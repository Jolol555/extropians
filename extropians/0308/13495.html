<p>I'll pipe in with a point (c) on this, which is that, even though, in my
<br>
view
<br>
this list does have a good spread of subject matter experts or aficionados,
<br>
its an international list and sometimes it takes 24 hours for a subject to
<br>
coincide
<br>
with the waking/reading cycles of those who have the time and know-how to
<br>
contribute. I know I've sometimes seen and wanted to post further on
<br>
threads that were of  clear interest to others but one does not always get
<br>
the
<br>
time to address them properly on all occasions. Because of the international
<br>
time cycle, sleep cycle thing, and with weekends not aligning exactly,
<br>
topics
<br>
once posted can sit on the list tantalisingly drawing quick heated responses
<br>
that can be fired off much faster than the more enlightened ones take to
<br>
prepare. To some extent just plain old list dynamics work per se work
<br>
against us. This is no excuse just something that I think that supports the
<br>
contention of trying to be courteous and following the few rules that we
<br>
have.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
