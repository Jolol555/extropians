In a message dated 8/11/2003 5:43:52 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:robblin@thetip.org?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20[forteana]%20Health%20Care:%20USA,%20Iraq%20&amp;%20Canada">robblin@thetip.org</a> writes: As for basis, in the sense that it's clear that the American 
<br>
monetary system commits us to a hawkish foreign policy (and that the hawkish 
<br>
foreign policy commits us to this monetary system) it equally makes us all 
<br>
severally and jointly responsible for the war-time and peace-time atrocities committed 
<br>
in the advancement of that project.
<br>
<p>Robbie,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I read that as a sweeping policy statement for a political 
<br>
philosophy of some party that you have not identified then it sounds great.  But 
<br>
you are not preaching to the converted and frankly you haven't proven anything 
<br>
you claim.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thread starts with a presumption that we are approaching the 
<br>
Singularity or failing that a new Renaissance.  Like any Renaissance we are talking 
<br>
about massive upheaval.  If it is the Singularity then there will be greater 
<br>
upset.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken the view that just as the last Renaissance resulted in 
<br>
the overthrow of one entire social class and the rise of a new one the years 
<br>
ahead of us will result in the same.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already in this Renaissance people are predicting what amounts to the 
<br>
overthrow of the American Consumer at king.  The jobs are moving off shore and 
<br>
the American will no longer have money to consume as he once did.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition just as the merchant and scholar once replaced the knight 
<br>
others have predicted that we are seeing the coming of the GT class and the 
<br>
over throw of the old money class -- the old money as a class doesn't have the 
<br>
brains to operate the businesses they own.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robbie, you made a great show of the interlocking of business 
<br>
interests in the companies that own each others stock.  That is old news.  One of the 
<br>
beauties of the modern capitalist economy is that anyone can buy stock on the 
<br>
open market.  People very often do spread their money out and invest in a 
<br>
great number of profitable businesses.  It is called diversification.  In addition 
<br>
when folks have a large enough sum invested they often gain representation on 
<br>
the board of directors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You closed by asking me, &quot;Sounds easy.  How do you propose to start?&quot;  
<br>
Well, I would start by recognising that you belong to a class of people that 
<br>
is replacing all the people that have been running corporations.  If you 
<br>
follow that train of thought for a while you will probably come to questions like 
<br>
where am I going to get the money and expertise to buy into the game?  I am 68 
<br>
but I know what I personally am going to do.  I have no doubt you can find 
<br>
your answers also.
<br>
Ron h.
