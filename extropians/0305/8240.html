<p><em>&gt; Several questions came up at the post nanoschmooze
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering gathering...
</em><br>
<p>More questions:
<br>
<p>Will Dr. Ramano will show up this year at
<br>
Burning Man?  Will they need to call it
<br>
Burning Surgeon?  Will he stop off at Reno
<br>
to play the one-armed bandits?
<br>
<p>If we changed Marilyn's name, would there
<br>
be any end to the wordplay?  {Marilyn
<br>
vos Savant, but then she took zee druks,
<br>
and after zat, she vos wery schtoopid...}
<br>
<p>Is there something deeply wrong with Michael
<br>
Crichton, that he gets some kind of perverse
<br>
pleasure from causing suffering and grief to
<br>
fictitious characters?  {Damn that guy.}
<br>
<p>What is the etymology of the term &quot;squicked&quot;?
<br>
<p>If lightning never strikes in the same place
<br>
twice, and your lightning rod gets a hit, should
<br>
you throw it away?  Do you need to get a new one
<br>
to replace it?  How do the later lightning
<br>
bolts know which places are already taken?
<br>
<p>What is the origin of the term etymology?
<br>
<p>What was the first game ever invented?  What
<br>
did people play before that?
<br>
<p>If a watched pot never boils, and mass-energy
<br>
is a conserved quantity, into what form does the
<br>
energy of the fire under a watched pot go?  Could
<br>
you use a pair of fake eyes to fool the pot into
<br>
thinking it is being watched?
<br>
<p>In a society that gets all squicked and starts
<br>
passing laws forbidding teens from their tongues
<br>
surgically split, why do we routinely whack off the
<br>
tip of the newborn's penis?  Presumably against
<br>
the infant's will?
