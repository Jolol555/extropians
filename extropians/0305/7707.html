</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Harvey, which study are you referring to? There were two, and I directly 
<br>
reported the key findings of the European one, which as far as I can 
<br>
tell did not as you claim specifically study high grain diets only. This 
<br>
is not the only example recently of you misreading, for whatever reason, 
<br>
what either I write or what a URL wrote.
<br>
<p>Go read the key findings page again:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm">http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm</a>
<br>
<p>The first key finding is specifically regarding fruits and vegetables. 
<br>
Now perhaps they simply left out grains by accident. Who knows. What 
<br>
matters is that their key findings mesh perfectly with the paleo diet. 
<br>
Or to put it another way: if you eat what the paleo diet says to eat, 
<br>
you are doing all three things this study says will reduce your cancer 
<br>
risks. Do you want to dispute that? If not, why don't you retract your 
<br>
claim that this study does not support the paleo diet. Who exactly is 
<br>
doing the misrepresenting here? It seems like both you and Bill K. read 
<br>
the first sentence of the BH story without looking carefully at BOTH 
<br>
studies, and instantly jumped to your own conclusions.
