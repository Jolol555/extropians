<p>&lt;&lt;Many Americans Follow War on BBC
<br>
<p>LONDON - Frustrated by the failure of U.S.-based broadcast networks to 
<br>
provide a realistic account of the political machinations that led to 
<br>
the Iraq war and the war itself, millions of Americans tuned in British 
<br>
news reports - which were picked up on public broadcasting and community 
<br>
radio and television stations.
<br>
<p>Already high American audience figures for BBC World News bulletins 
<br>
spiked by 28 percent in the first weeks of the war, and BBC officials 
<br>
delighted in e-mails like the one from a New York viewer who wrote, &quot;The 
<br>
BBC seems to be the only decent source of news on this conflict. 
<br>
American networks are appalling.&quot;
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>So embarrassing was the U.S. coverage of the war - and so conscious was 
<br>
the rest of the world of collapse of basic journalistic standards - that 
<br>
BBC director general Greg Dyke found it necessary to promise that, &quot;In 
<br>
the area of impartiality, as in many other areas, we must ensure that we 
<br>
don't become Americanized.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dyke, who is generally seen as an ally of Blair, admitted that he was 
<br>
&quot;shocked while in the United States by how unquestioning the broadcast 
<br>
news media was during the war.&quot; He added that, while in the U.S., he was 
<br>
&quot;amazed by how many people just came up to me and said they were 
<br>
following the war on the BBC because they no longer trusted the American 
<br>
electronic news media.&quot; &gt;&gt;
