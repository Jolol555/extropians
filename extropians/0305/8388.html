<em>&gt; where our friends appear to be debating it, although Wei Dai
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflects what I read in game theory papers these days:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hofstadter was wrong about superrationality.  Once, in 1985
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or so, I wrote him about it, and we exchanged a few letters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (he was always incredibly good that way).  What I would like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do now---though I won't because it would be &quot;rubbing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in&quot;---would be to write him and ask whether he would Cooperate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Defect against the 1983 version of himself if he could go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back in a time machine.  *OBVIOUSLY* Doug 2003 should Defect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since he knows that the 1983 version is going to cooperate.
</em><br>
<p>Not if Doug-2003 is also an altruist.  There's more than one possible 
<br>
reason to cooperate, after all.  From my viewpoint, the only good reason 
<br>
to *defect* is a Tit-for-Tat retaliation to maintain social order. 
<br>
Otherwise the calculation is very simple; maximum benefit to all sentients 
<br>
is optimized by taking C.  For a true altruist, the game theory that would 
<br>
ever lead to choosing D is as surprising and counterintuitive as the game 
<br>
theory that can lead a selfish agent to choose C.
<br>
<p>For that matter, Doug-1983 anticipates being Doug-2003, so it's in his 
<br>
best selfish interest to cooperate even if he thinks Doug-2003 will 
<br>
defect.  This, of course, makes it harder to threaten subjunctive 
<br>
defection, which is what you want to do to maintain mutual cooperation, 
<br>
which maximizes the return to both temporal slices of yourself.
<br>
<p>Mixing time travel and the Prisoner's Dilemna sure does make for some 
<br>
interesting situations.  It can be resolved to mutual cooperation using 
<br>
the Golden Law, but only if Doug-1983 can accurately simulate a future 
<br>
self who knows his past self's decision.  The time-travel oneshot PD can 
<br>
also be resolved much more straightforwardly by making a binding promise 
<br>
to yourself, using self-modification or a pre-existing emotion of honor.
