Harvey, Brian pointed out that only one author on that website is worth
<br>
reading, and I agree.
<br>
<p>It is clear that the site itself has a dubious agenda, and that the
<br>
webmaster did not select his or her articles very intelligently, but there
<br>
are many authors published there. Don't make the mistake of throwing the
<br>
baby out with the bathwater.
<br>
<p>The author of the article cited by Brian is right, imo, to question what she
<br>
terms &quot;Politically Correct Nutrition.&quot; It was &quot;Politically Correct
<br>
Nutrition&quot; which ultimately brought us the high-carb grain-based USDA food
<br>
pyramid, which in turn has led to a number of health problems. 
<br>
<p>We are right now in middle of a national health crisis in type II diabetes
<br>
and obesity, certainly due in part to our poor national diet so rich in
<br>
carbohydrate. The pro-carb movement in the middle of the last century was a
<br>
reaction to the lipid hypothesis, an hypothesis which the author rightly
<br>
criticizes.

<em>&gt; &gt; I absolutely knew you were going to do that when I posted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the message. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's why I specifically asked for comments on that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular page 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instead of your opinion on the other pages (which I note 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are written 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by many other authors).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a waste of my time to refute every crackpot webpage 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gets posted for review.  When a site obviously is full 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of misinformation and pseudoscience, it is inefficient to go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through and &quot;prove&quot; each item is wrong.  More than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient, it is dangerous.  If I fail to prove something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, I end up believing some of the pseudoscience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Please only respond further to this sub-thread if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you are willing to actually discuss the page in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question and its references.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who deanimated and made you boss?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should I stand by quietly while people get duped into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to a pseudoscience website?  Why shouldn't I point out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this site is full of misinformation and people should be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful before they start trusting this site as a source of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutritional advice?  Nutrition is dangerous enough without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people taking their information from sites like these.
