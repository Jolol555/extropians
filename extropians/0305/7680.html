<p>And I am glad to know I'm not the only one here who sees the virtue of a
<br>
natural paleolithic diet!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have not always practiced it myself, but I am getting better.
</em><br>
<p>I understand. It is always a struggle to resist the temptation to stray into
<br>
non-paleo territory. High-carb and high-saturated fat foods are everywhere.
<br>
Processed foods full of transfats and other undesirable ingredients are
<br>
everywhere. The supermarket is an obstacle course for the American consumer,
<br>
and sometimes I stumble just as you do. I try to do my shopping around the
<br>
perimeter, where the paleo foods can be found. The fresh produce, fresh fish
<br>
and meats sections are where the best foods are located. 
<br>
<p>I notice that I have become even more diligent about adhering strictly to my
<br>
diet since I started participating in these diet threads. I hate to say one
<br>
thing while doing another. :) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Five servings of fruits and veggies on Atkins] is quite possible, so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long as you avoid the starchy veggies like corn, potatoes, carrots, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peas, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose it can be done by a very careful Atkins dieter who knows his plant
<br>
foods.
<br>
<p>Speaking of knowing one's plant foods, corn is not properly considered a
<br>
vegetable in the first place, except perhaps by the loosest definition. Corn
<br>
is a grain in the same category with wheat, rye, rice, etc. All grains are
<br>
extremely non-paleolithic. 
<br>
<p>It's notable that farmers fatten their cattle on high-carb, high-omega-6,
<br>
non-paleo corn. 
<br>
<p>Also potatoes and other starchy tubers including carrots were not an
<br>
important part of the paleodiet. Potatoes in particular are very
<br>
non-paleolithic; they cannot be digested well in their raw state. 
<br>
<p>Peas are legumes; also not part of a strict paleodiet.
<br>
<p>So then what you're really saying above is that Atkins dieters can eat five
<br>
servings of fruits and vegetables each day provided that they avoid
<br>
non-paleolithic &quot;quasi-vegetables&quot; like corn, potatoes, carrots and peas. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will generally eat lettuce, celery, onions, mushrooms in a salad. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will also eat lots of broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, and other leafy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greens.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent, very paleo. Spinach, broccoli and onions are my favorites. I make
<br>
my salads with raw chilled baby spinach leaves and top them with chopped
<br>
broccoli crowns, and usually include chopped onions along with other
<br>
vegetables. Broccoli is such a great vegetable that I sometimes also take
<br>
broccoli sprout extract as a supplement. Among other things, broccoli
<br>
sprouts are rich in a substance called sulphorophane, known to help protect
<br>
against some forms of cancer. Onions are also thought to be beneficial
<br>
against cancer, though the evidence for onions is not so conclusive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't analyzed beets...
</em><br>
<p>Beets make the cut.
