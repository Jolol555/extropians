</em><br>
<p>I must disagree.  HIV doesn't show any symptoms at first, often not for many
<br>
years.  Most of the early symptoms are random because the immune system
<br>
failure allows various diseases to affect the host, and it is these diseases
<br>
that manifest.  It also took a long time to identify the antibodies, develop
<br>
the test, and identify the specific causative virus, and even that was
<br>
disputed.  We simply didn't recognize the disease or have ways of testing
<br>
people in the early years.  I don't think the corrective measures you
<br>
propose could have been implemented in the beginning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, the precedent set by the gay community in opposing HIV
</em><br>
<em>&gt; containment remedies in favor of individual rights has caused a massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resurgence in other communicable diseases like TB, Syphillis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gonorrhea, etc and hampered the ability of health care workers to nip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epidemics in the bud. The ability of the US health care system to deal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with bioterror attacks is similarly compromised as a result.
</em><br>
<p>You say that the gays acted badly, and now everyone else is too.  Or in
<br>
other words, the gays acted no different than any other group that has also
<br>
faced similar situations.  I think this has to do more with human nature
<br>
than gay politics.
