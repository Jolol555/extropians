<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; I think that the majority of Americans (people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less interested in the rigor of intellect and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logic of a group like this as well as less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inclined or able to analyze the details and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structure of arguments being presented to them)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are consistently tricked, duped, programmed - by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a language that denies or regretfully forgets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the major discoveries made by physicists in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1920's and anthropologists ever since.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that was prior to 1933 when we all got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightened out.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, what a man he was (sarcasm). The first mad visionary to bring 
<br>
human eugenics to such a massive and structured level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Namely, that there are multiple interpretations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of every situation, i.e. light seem like a wave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if we test it like this and a particle if we do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it like this.  I.e. peace loving hippies or dirty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; jobless, commies i.e. &quot;Jimmy Carter takes a cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shot at president Bush!&quot; or &quot;Jimmy Carter, Tellin'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it like it is.&quot; etc . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Curious how until 1933 humanity had not been yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favored by evolution to adopt appropriate and sane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech patterns.  One might have thought that given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several hundred thousand years, nineteen civilizations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innumerable tribes and nations and societies competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with each other, better techniques of thinking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning were not stumbled upon.  So the burden of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation must now lie with those who claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ways humans think now and have been thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since 1610 are unfit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sarcasm again? I'm not sure. Just in case, to clarify,
<br>
i don't think that humanity has not developed &quot;appropriately.&quot;
<br>
Rather i think that in the case of relativity and the Copenhagen 
<br>
Interpretation as with much of  scientific history it takes
<br>
a while for new discoveries to reach popular culture. More, i will 
<br>
enjoy the emergence of the type of thinking i think come about from 
<br>
the integration of quantum thinking. (This seems inevitable and is 
<br>
already happening due to the proliferation of quantum technology 
<br>
such as computers).
<br>
<p>Language being what it is, and shaping the way 
<br>
people and cultures think, in the way s that it does
<br>
leads me to be hopefully curious as to how the addition of 
<br>
quantum language or even more simply language patterns 
<br>
like e-prime will affect  human behavior.
<br>
E-prime has already been hailed by many a semanticist 
<br>
as a useful tool in getting out of the bias of Aristotelian &quot;IS&quot; logic 
<br>
and making accessible the experience and understanding 
<br>
of neurological relativity.
<br>
<p>In anycase, i personally am not going to try and prove that 
<br>
&quot;the ways humans think now and have been thinking since 
<br>
1610 are unfit.&quot; If you want the refernces to the research on 
<br>
how language affects culture and behavior let me know and i'll
<br>
get it to you when i return from vacation - next tuesday.
<br>
<p>In general, i hold the position that - hopefully without getting too
<br>
pedantic or zen about this - things are as they are. Life is. And, based
<br>
on the outcomes desired i take in the most accurate information i can 
<br>
and make my decisions based on those as to how to think about the 
<br>
world better (i.e. in a more and more logical and well-formed manner)
<br>
and act with the ability to most easily get the results i want.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In this case, i think that the idea and philosophy behind e-prime 
<br>
is a wonderful tool for well-formed thinking.
<br>
<p>Furthermore i'm less excited about trying to show something 
<br>
i don't believe - i.e. the world was&quot;unfit,&quot; and more interested in 
<br>
experimenting and demonstrating what *is* possible. (I'm currently in 
<br>
the process of this so we'll have to wait a few years before we get 
<br>
any worthwhile results. I'll happily share the details with anyone 
<br>
interested.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; (It is well to keep in mind that those societies which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce the highest viable birth ratios, e.g. Europe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before 1910 and the United States before about the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, are the most fit.  Today European biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fitness has reached in some places the incredible 1.1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---unsurviveability to an extreme degree.)
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't understand what this means: &quot;Today European biological
<br>
fitness has reached in some places the incredible 1.1
<br>
---unsurviveability to an extreme degree.)&quot;
<br>
<p>Could you please explain?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Maybe general semantics and a course of logic should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be included in journalism schools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is indeed sad to see even young reporters who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lapse immediately upon graduation to the two-valued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevalent aristotelian orientations, adopt bad s.r,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g., fail to adopt *structural* and multi-ordinal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semanitic relations, employ elementalistic terminology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intensional definitions, employ undue generalization,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unanalyzed linguistic habits., to such a degree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's probably too late to re-educate the younger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation with null-A non-habitual s.r, remove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semantic blockages,.
</em><br>
<p>what is s.r?
<br>
also, what is null-A- habitual s.r.?
<br>
<p>Thanks Lee.
<br>
<p>Best,
