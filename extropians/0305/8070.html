<p><em>&gt; True, but the &quot;low fat&quot; obsession is orthogonal to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in both the vegetarian and carnivorous realms.  
</em><br>
<p>What does a high-fat vegetarian diet look like? I suppose a vegetarian would
<br>
need to completely drench his vegetables in butter and oils to make his diet
<br>
high-fat. Of course there is also cheese and eggs, which might be consumed
<br>
depending on the denomination of the vegetarian church to which one belongs.
<br>
:)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then we seem to be mostly agreed on nutrients and what should 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, our general preferred ratios of macronutrients are probably similar,
<br>
but as I've noted there are many potentially nutritious/deleterious
<br>
substances that distinguish an omnivorous paleo diet from a vegetarian diet.
<br>
As you must have gathered by now, I am most concerned with the unhealthy
<br>
substances found in grains and legumes in the typical vegetarian diet, e.g.,
<br>
lectins. 
<br>
<p>Dairy products contain small amounts of lectins also but I think they are
<br>
relatively harmless in comparison to grains and legumes (do you consume
<br>
dairy? I don't remember). Still dairy products tend to rank very low on a
<br>
nutrients/calorie scale. I was looking at the composition of cheddar cheese
<br>
the other day, as an example. Cheddar cheese is tasty but it is
<br>
approximately 70% of calories from fat, mostly saturated. Aside from some
<br>
protein and calcium it has virtually no redeeming nutritional qualities. As
<br>
I think you'll agree, it would be wiser to spend one's calories on a huge
<br>
garden salad than on a small chunk of cheese.
