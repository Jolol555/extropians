I think this is excellent advice from Amara, though I would personally avoid
<br>
grains altogether for reasons I've made clear in other threads.
<br>
<p>A few weeks ago, on another health-related discussion list, a subscriber
<br>
related her success with a detoxification diet similar to the one described
<br>
by Amara. The diet she tried is called _The Fat Flush Plan_. On the surface
<br>
the diet appears to have all the trappings of a typical fat diet, but I was
<br>
impressed by her story because she was successful with the diet even after
<br>
having already lost a lot of weight on the Atkins diet. Also upon closer
<br>
inspection the diet very closely matches my own general theories about
<br>
proper paleolithic diet.
<br>
<p>She was frustrated that she seemed unable to lose the last stubborn 10-15
<br>
pounds that she wanted to lose. The Atkins diet was not helping her lose the
<br>
remaining weight. She shifted to the Fat Flush diet, which is essentially a
<br>
modified low-carb Atkins-style diet with an emphasis on detoxification and
<br>
healthy fats. Along with some fairly conventional recommendations (modest
<br>
portions of lean meat and eggs and lots of fruits and vegetables) the diet
<br>
prescribes a tablespoon of flaxseed oil each day to return the omega 6/3
<br>
balance to more natural levels, and includes drinking some kind of diluted
<br>
cranberry juice drink three times daily for purposes of detoxification. I
<br>
don't know the exact recipe for the cranberry juice drink. Apparently the
<br>
creator of the diet believes it is an essential element of the diet. It
<br>
certainly couldn't hurt; cranberry is an excellent source of antioxidants
<br>
and seems to have anti-microbial properties. The woman on the discussion
<br>
list related that in a matter of a few weeks she dropped the extra stubborn
<br>
pounds that would not go away on Atkins.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before your diet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a suggestion for those embarking on diets. You might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to condition your mind and household at the same time as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditioning your body with a body fruit-and-vegetable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughput for one week.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During the seven days you give your body a break from refined 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flour, sugar and caffeine, and you drink an unlimited amount 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of herbal teas, juices, and you eat an unlimited amount of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruits and vegetables. &lt;snip&gt;
