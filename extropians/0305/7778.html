<p>
The Phoenix Exultant is now available in stores, the sequel to John
<br>
C. Wright's groundbreaking first novel, The Golden Age (which is now
<br>
out in paperback).  I'll give a brief review here, mostly spoiler-free,
<br>
followed by some philosophical speculations triggered by the nvoel.
<br>
<p>The bad news is that the rumors were true, this turns out to be the
<br>
second book in a trilogy, and we will have to wait for the third book,
<br>
The Golden Transcendence, for the end of the story.  I don't know when
<br>
that will be published.
<br>
<p>I was a little disappointed by this book.  The storyline was built around
<br>
frustrated desires.  Phaethon spends most of the book stuck on a barge in
<br>
the harbor.  There's not as much technology shown, and what there is we
<br>
have largely seen before.  I guess I'm kind of jaded after reading the
<br>
first book, I want more! and new! and better! techno-thrills.  It's not
<br>
until the last two chapters that things get going again, suggesting that
<br>
the third book will be more to my liking.
<br>
<p>On the positive side, we do learn more about the history of the future,
<br>
details about the war between the Bellipotent Composition and the warlocks
<br>
at the close of the Fourth Mental Structure for example.  There is an
<br>
informative soliloquy between Rhadamanthus and Eveningstar, two of the
<br>
main sophotechs, about their views towards humanity and the relations
<br>
between the superintelligent AIs and human beings.  And there is more
<br>
humor in this volume; conversations between Phaethon and his wife often
<br>
made me laugh.  I enjoy Wright's style, and found quotable passages in
<br>
almost every chapter.  The book was a quick read; I got through it in
<br>
a couple of days, but as I said I felt that the story dragged.
<br>
<p>One thing that is still unclear to me is why and how Wright's society
<br>
adopted its libertarian foundations.  There seem to be three main
<br>
forces in the world for enforcing these policies: the Curia, which is
<br>
the traditional government; the Hortators, who enforce moral policies via
<br>
widely-observed voluntary boycotts; and the sophotechs, who have the power
<br>
to do anything, but who restrain themselves, and who protect the humans
<br>
from each other.  We don't see that much about how these forces interact.
<br>
<p>Who are the Curia?  We've only seen the judiciary and the military
<br>
(apparently just one man, Atkins, aided by the Warmind sophotech).
<br>
Are there elections?  Who sets the laws?  Can they be changed?  Or is
<br>
it possible that the sophotechs have adopted libertarianism as the best
<br>
morality, and they enforce it on the humans?  I'll quote part of the talk
<br>
between Eveningstar and Rhadamanthus which may shed some light on this.
<br>
They are explaining the &quot;ultimate purpose&quot; of sophotechnology, which is
<br>
in part the formation of a Universal Mind, the collection or sum of all
<br>
minds in the universe.  Wright assumes that modern physical theories are
<br>
broadly correct, that after the era of stars, the universe will continue
<br>
to expand and die a heat death.
<br>
<p>&quot;Eveningstar said, 'It will be a Mind of the Cosmic Night.   Over
<br>
ninety-nine percent of its existence will extend through that period of
<br>
universal evolution that takes place after the extinction of all stars.
<br>
The Universal Mind will be embodied in and powered by the disintegration
<br>
of dark matter, Hawking radiations from singularity decay, and gravitic
<br>
tidal disturbances caused by the slowing of the expansion of the universe.
<br>
After final proton decay has reduced all baryonic particles below
<br>
threshold limits, the Universal Mind can exist only on the consumption
<br>
of stored energies, which, in effect, will require the sacrifice of
<br>
some parts of itself to other parts.  Such an entity will primarily be
<br>
concerned with the questions of how to die with stoic grace, cherishing,
<br>
even while it dies, the finite universe and finite time available.'
<br>
<p>&quot;'Consequently, it would not forgive the use of force or strength
<br>
merely to preserve life.  Mere life, life at any cost, cannot be its
<br>
highest value.  As we expect to be a part of this higher being, perhaps
<br>
a core part, we must share that higher value.  You must realize what is
<br>
at stake here: If the Universal Mind consists of entities willing to
<br>
use force against innocents in order to survive, then the last period
<br>
of the universe, which embraces the vast majority of universal time,
<br>
will be a period of cannibalistic and unimaginable war, rather than
<br>
a time of gentle contemplation filled, despite all melancholy, with
<br>
unregretful joy.  No entity willing to initiate the use of force against
<br>
another can be permitted to join or to influence the Universal Mind or
<br>
the lesser entities, such as the Earthmind, who may one day form the
<br>
core constituencies.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, it's not a very Extropian goal!  Sitting around and contemplating
<br>
our memories as we wait to die isn't how I was hoping to spend 99% of the
<br>
life of the universe.  However I suppose that if that's the hand Nature
<br>
has dealt us, then this is a classy way to play it out.  And it is a
<br>
rather amusing justification for libertarianism.  Note the magic phrase,
<br>
&quot;initiate the use of force,&quot; which is a defining criterion for modern
<br>
libertarian philosophy.
<br>
<p>So my thinking is, maybe the sophotechs have decided on this basis to
<br>
support libertarianism, presenting it to humans as a fait accompli,
<br>
and human society then has to adapt to it, from which we more or less
<br>
automatically get the twin bodies of the Curia, which enforces the limited
<br>
laws, and the Hortators, built around voluntary persuasion.  I can't
<br>
help thinking of Eliezer's old justification for building a super AI,
<br>
that it would figure out what Absolute Morality was, and then enforce it.
<br>
Wright's world may be an example of how this could work out.
