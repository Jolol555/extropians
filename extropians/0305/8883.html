<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not one that sits around hanging on the biography of RR.  But I 
<br>
seem to remember that he was attending meeting when he came to realize that 
<br>
some of the speech and conduct constituted a non sequiter because he was not 
<br>
around when the real discussion and decisions were made.  As I recall he asked 
<br>
someone what was going on and he asked a really angry non communist.  They 
<br>
invited him to a get together of the non communist group within the organization. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We forget today that the International Communist movement was very 
<br>
active in this country by 1930 or 1931.  The Communist Party had long since 
<br>
infiltrated the actors groups by the end of WW2.  When RR got active it was more a 
<br>
matter of the non communists infiltrating than the other way round.
<br>
