<em>&gt; I would bet that the facts would show that the embedded reporter filed

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Strange, but I have the opposite interpretation.  The embedded journalists
<br>
usually were kept out of combat and out of harm's way.  They filed live
<br>
reports from the aircraft carriers hundreds of miles away from the real
<br>
action.  Whereas those reporters on the balconies of the hotels were often
<br>
in the very buildings being bombed.  They seemed to have a better view of
<br>
the battleground than the embedded reporters most of the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonembeds were of two sorts. They were either in bed with the enemy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from non-coalition countries and cooperated with the Baath regime, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were of the old school cocktail set that thought covering a war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant spending more time around a hotel pool than anywhere else. Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the embeds, in my opinion, deserve the title Journalist.
</em><br>
<p>Wow!  Do you realize how close to endorsing a government-controlled media
<br>
this is?  Only those reporters sponsored, approved and fed information from
<br>
the military government are real journalists, while independents, unapproved
<br>
journalists are automatically suspect and maybe even enemy sympathizers if
<br>
their stories don't match the official government releases.  Without even
<br>
arguing the accuracy of this, even the theory of what you are proposing
<br>
seems about as anti-liberty as one can get.  Since when did the free press
<br>
become the enemy of liberty and pro-government-controlled-media become the
<br>
politically correct position?  Who are you and what have you done with Mike
<br>
Lorrey?  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The classic example was Greg Kelly of FOX reporting from the front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steps of Saddam's new palace in Bagdad at the same time that Bagdad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bob, aka Comical Ali, was claiming a few blocks away to international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporters that there were no Americans in Bagdad. Nobody today will now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim to have been present at Bagdad Bob's news conferences and taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his pronouncements as fact, though many did so at the time.
</em><br>
<p>True, but there are similar cases in reverse.  The famous image of Saddam's
<br>
statue being pulled down by Iraqi citizens are now known to have been staged
<br>
by the military using ex-Iraqis that we shipped in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please, Harvey, document any actual instance where an embedded reporter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was ordered to report facts not in evidence.
</em><br>
<p>You will probably object that these examples don't prove the reporters were
<br>
&quot;ordered&quot; to lie, but they certainly were fed information which later turned
<br>
out to be false.
<br>
<p>Read &quot;The Military's Media&quot; by Robert Jensen
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.progressive.org/may03/jen0503.html">http://www.progressive.org/may03/jen0503.html</a>&gt;.  The first paragraph claims
<br>
that reporters were given specific orders on what to say and not say in
<br>
their news broadcasts.  He even quotes one reporter saying &quot;we have been
<br>
given orders&quot; and changing it to &quot;the soldier have been given orders&quot; later.
<br>
<p>The toppling of Saddam's statue was a staged event reported exactly as the
<br>
military told the reporters to report it.
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2842.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2842.htm</a>&gt;  Wider pictures
<br>
show the obviously staged small event in a cordained off area.  It is hard
<br>
to imagine that anybody involved thought this was a real event being
<br>
reported.  They reporters and camera crews all helped stage the events,
<br>
crop, edit the pictures to make it appear like a large crowded event, and
<br>
then presented the desired result as independent, objective news and not a
<br>
military PR event.
<br>
<p>Looting in Bagdad was often encouraged (or at least not discouraged) by U.S.
<br>
soldiers and then fed to the reporters as evidence of the populace rising up
<br>
against Saddam.
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3311.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3311.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>This report lists a number of instances where independent reporters were int
<br>
imidated by the U.S. military trying to block their stories when they
<br>
disputed the official military version.
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0401-10.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0401-10.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>The rescue of Jessica Lynch seems to have been highly fictional according to
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/64568.html">http://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/64568.html</a>&gt;.  It describes the embedded
<br>
reporters as being hand-picked by the military and too dependent on reports
<br>
fed to them from their military handlers.  It also lists a whole bunch of
<br>
other stories that turned out to be inaccurate.  All of these seem to have
<br>
been fed to the reporters who dutifully reported them, and then later turned
<br>
out to have no basis in fact or no supporting evidence besides the military
<br>
press release.  One particularly obvious story is the article written by
<br>
Times reporter Judith Miller, who later admitted that she was not allowed to
<br>
see any of the evidence or interview the people.  She just repeated what the
<br>
military handlers told her to say.  This probably has the longest list of
<br>
specific examples.
