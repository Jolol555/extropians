<p><em>&gt; I am still not seeing how or why you hold Michael Fumento morally

</em><br>
<em>&gt; but reading comments on it I think you misjudged its content. 
</em><br>
<p>I began his book but could not finish it quite some years ago.  I 
<br>
have read additional excerpts from it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please explain your line of reasoning that holds Fumento direclty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally culpable for any deaths in Africa from AIDS.  Was he over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there plunging used needles into people, and forcing idiots with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIDS to rape virgins?  
</em><br>
<p>No.  He was busy insisting that AIDS was a non-heterosexual problem 
<br>
and thus lending sanction to those who chose to ignore it as a &quot;gay 
<br>
problem&quot; and even &quot;the wrath of God&quot; instead of doing very much about 
<br>
it.  The result, of course not limited to him, was many millions of 
<br>
needless deaths and seriously compromised health of millions more.  
<br>
He wrote what he wrote despite the evidence that AIDS does not only 
<br>
pick on gay men or only visit those who engage in certain forms of 
<br>
sex and those who use needles.  In short he did highly slanted and 
<br>
inflammatory reporting of a hot topic like many others.  I hold 
<br>
supposed intellectuals who twist the truth responsible for the 
<br>
consequences of being believed.  He is certainly not the only one.  
<br>
But it will take a lot for me to trust him and his arguments about 
<br>
anything now.  He has an image as the naysayer who bucks the tide to 
<br>
support.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Shall we blame him, and not the people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually committ these heinous acts, or the corrupt tyrannical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments and warring fanctions that keep the people in africa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant, poor, unhealthy, and superstitious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I did not say the blame was his alone.  But the blame is most 
<br>
certainly partially his.    And the problem is not restricted to 
<br>
Africa or to regimes we abhor or to those who commit any sort of 
<br>
heinous act at all or their victims.   AIDS is a disease, not a moral 
<br>
reproach.
