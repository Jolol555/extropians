LVAD has entered the building...  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;05.29.03

<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;Can some heart failure patients recover without a heart transplant? As this 
<br>
ScienCentral News video reports, researchers at Duke University say a heart 
<br>
assist device now used as a bridge to a transplant could be a bridge to 
<br>
recovery. 
<br>
<p>Heart Break
<br>
<p>Thousands of Americans would benefit from a life-saving heart transplant each 
<br>
year. To keep heart failure patients alive while they wait for a new heart, 
<br>
doctors sometimes use a device called the Left Ventricular Assist Device, or 
<br>
LVAD (pronounced “el-vad”). The left ventricle is the chamber in the heart that 
<br>
pumps blood throughout the body (except the lungs). It’s the ventricle that 
<br>
needs help in heart failure, which is where the LVAD comes in, essentially “
<br>
becoming” the left ventricle for the patient until a new heart becomes available.
<br>
<p>For a patient with a failing heart, the LVAD provides a welcome break. “The 
<br>
assist device actually provides a semi-vacation of sorts to the heart,” says 
<br>
Burns Blaxall, postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Experimental Surgery at &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.mc.duke.edu/index3.htm">http://www.mc.duke.edu/index3.htm</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>
Duke University Medical Center&lt;/A&gt;. “And that is also most likely why the heart 
<br>
recovers, because it’s been given this vacation to kind of relax and recover.”
<br>
<p>The LVAD can even lead to structural improvements in heart muscle, which is 
<br>
called remodeling. “The reason that these [devices] are so important is because 
<br>
fewer than 3,000 transplant hearts are available per year, and obviously 
<br>
there are many more people who require them. So these devices are used and 
<br>
approved as a bridge to transplant.” 
<br>
<p>Now researchers are finding that some patients can use this “bridge to 
<br>
transplant” as an actual bridge to recovery, and avoid transplant surgery entirely. 
<br>
Blaxall and his team, who published their report in the April 2, 2003 issue of 
<br>
the <A HREF="http://www.acc.org/media/media_journals.htm">Journal of the American College of Cardiology</A>, used high-tech gene chips 
<br>
to analyze samples of patients' heart tissue that were taken when the LVAD was 
<br>
implanted, and then when it was removed. Also known as DNA micro arrays, gene 
<br>
chips tell researchers which genes are switched on or off within a cell. “The 
<br>
micro array has representation of several thousand known human genes,” 
<br>
explains Blaxall. “We extract information from the tissue by incubating it with 
<br>
these micro arrays. Then they can help us determine the changes in gene expression 
<br>
that have occurred during the heart’s vacation, while it’s been supported 
<br>
with the ventricular assist device.” 
<br>
<p>The researchers found that the LVAD changes the activity of genes in the heart
<br>
’s cells, and those changes have a specific pattern in patients whose hearts 
<br>
were strengthened with the device. Specifically, some genes were either more 
<br>
or less active after the implant surgery. This provided the scientists with 
<br>
kind of an overview of the genetics of remodeling. Scientists now need to 
<br>
determine which genes are associated with remodeling.
<br>
<p>The study is preliminary, but it represents a first step toward predicting 
<br>
how heart failure patients will respond when supported by a LVAD. “Our hope is 
<br>
that we may be able to determine beforehand whether a patient will respond 
<br>
favorably to ventricular assist device support or whether indeed they may require 
<br>
a transplant,” says Blaxall.&gt;&gt;
