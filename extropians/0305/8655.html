<p><em>&gt; So while agriculture was a mistake that did in fact create powerful

</em><br>
<p>Exactly. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Causally the answer may be yes; the mistake may be

</em><br>
<p>Yes. 
<br>
<p>Diamond emphasizes that this worst mistake in the history of the human race
<br>
was the result of *choice*: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Forced to choose between limiting population or trying to increase food
<br>
production, we chose the latter and ended up with starvation, warfare, and
<br>
tyranny.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course the decision to domesticate plants and animals was not made
<br>
consciously by some World Committee of HG Overseers. It was a choice made
<br>
gradually in small steps by many people over several thousand years. 
<br>
<p>But let us say for the sake of argument that such a World Committee of HG
<br>
Overseers did exist, and that it was comprised of intelligent, worldly
<br>
people (they were the prehistoric ancestors of extropians :) Let us say
<br>
further that the committee was given access to a crystal ball to see into
<br>
the future, and that despite the ability to peer into the future, the future
<br>
nevertheless remained undecided. How might they have deliberated? 
<br>
<p>I suppose the argument against the agriculture decision might look something
<br>
like this: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Why, fellow Overseers, should we choose to expand the world population of
<br>
humans unless doing so will in some way benefit all humanity? We can see
<br>
here in our crystal ball that agriculture will allow for a greatly increased
<br>
population, but what good is an increased population in and of itself? The
<br>
population explosion will come at the expense of even more hunger, poverty
<br>
and tyranny. Would it not be better instead to control the population now so
<br>
that we have no need for these cheap sources of calories that make such poor
<br>
substitutes for the wild plants and animals upon which we thrive? Look there
<br>
into the future -- our 20th century our progeny will invent convenient birth
<br>
control methods. Perhaps we should be trying to develop birth control
<br>
methods now when it is most needed, rather than then when it will be all but
<br>
too late to make a difference. We could then still work to develop other
<br>
technologies that might benefit our species.&quot;
<br>
<p>Diamond mentions that infanticide was a choice made by HG'ers to keep the
<br>
population low before the advent of agriculture. An HG woman would have
<br>
needed to wait until a child was about four and no longer in need of
<br>
carrying before she could rear another child, so Diamond supposes that
<br>
HG'ers must have killed those born during the years between. 
<br>
<p>However as moderns we are not forced to kill newborns. We have birth
<br>
control, and we have a choice to avoid the poor quality foods that come from
<br>
agriculture and animal husbandry. 
<br>
<p>We moderns have the ability to learn from our mistakes, in this case even
<br>
the worst mistake in the history of the human race.
