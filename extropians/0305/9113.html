<p><em>&gt; I also read that article and yes I noticed the kid made a passing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference to God but I don't know upon what level of intensity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read that.  Is he extremely religious or has he picked up an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expression without thinking what it even means?  
</em><br>
<p>Hell, even though an extremely devout atheist myself, I use
<br>
the term as an expression all the time!  I can hardly believe
<br>
it when some people (who know I am an atheist) wonder about
<br>
my usage of the term.  Jesus Christ.  Give me a break  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I noticed that everyone has walked right by the reporters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand wringing over this kid allegedly being so bright.  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the others, by your silence, agree that there is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply wrong with having an IQ that high?
</em><br>
<p>It would be a miracle if anyone on this list really thought that
<br>
a high IQ could be something bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If so you might excuse him on that basis.  If you think a boy that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent can and is perfectly healthy then you might also excuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his belief in God on that basis.
</em><br>
<p>There are arbitrarily intelligent people who believe in God.
<br>
Just being extraordinarily intelligent is no guarantee 
<br>
against being wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case given that the universe is somewhere 10 and 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion years old (I have seen no agreement on the age);
</em><br>
<p>Recently they seem to have pegged it at 14.7 billion years
<br>
(see the recent Tegmark article).  I guess the old dilemma
<br>
between the star-clusters and whatever-the-other-argument
<br>
was has been resolved.  14.7 billion years it is, then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under all those circumstances isn't it a little dogmatic to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make vast sweeping statements about God?
</em><br>
<p>I am just as dogmatic about God as I am about flying saucers
<br>
and Santa Claus.  At least I can be dogmatic about it until
<br>
some Bayesian altruist tells me he's had a vision, or has been
<br>
abducted by a flying saucer, and then, of course, I will 
<br>
concede that I have been wrong, and that flying saucers or
<br>
God exists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my opinion we have to all be somewhat agnostic whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we mainly believe in God or believe there is no God.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to reserve a possibility that we are mistaken.
</em><br>
<p>Nah, that's for sissies.  By God, I am not afraid to go out
<br>
on a limb!
