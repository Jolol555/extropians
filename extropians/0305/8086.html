<em>&gt;&gt; I got a good chuckle about a week ago during the opening comedy

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; comedy talk-show that comes on late at night after Jay Leno).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Conan said something like:

<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;I hear China is starting its first 24 hour cable news network. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will of course be illegal for the network to voice opinions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; oppose the ruling party. They're going to call it Fox News.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hehehe.  But wouldn't CNN be a more straightforward acronym?
</em><br>
<p>CNN can hardly be accused of toeing the ruling party line. In fact many
<br>
folks here think CNN is guilty of the opposite crime.
<br>
<p>Personally I agree with those who think CNN is biased to the left, but I
<br>
think it is not nearly as biased as FOX is biased to the right. In my
<br>
opinion FOX has been accused rightly of becoming the unofficial &quot;Mouthpiece
<br>
for the White House.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I note also from the long discussion we had here about six or eight weeks
<br>
ago that bias in the news media is very much in the eye of the beholder.
<br>
People tend not to notice bias in the news when the bias agrees with their
<br>
political world-view.
<br>
<p>Cable news networks are not obliged by law to serve the public interest,
<br>
which is one reason we see extreme advocacy journalism on cable like that
<br>
which comes from FOX.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It will be interesting to watch FOX News if a Dem gets elected next time
<br>
around. The network will have two options if it wants to keep market share: 
<br>
<p>1) FOX will launch a &quot;Let's all hate the liberals in the White House&quot;
<br>
platform similar to that of Rush Limbaugh during the Clinton administration,
<br>
<p><p>or 
<br>
<p>2) FOX will fire 3/4 of its staff, struggle to find new guests, and try
<br>
desperately to transform itself into a moderate or liberal news channel.
<br>
<p>I think option 1) is most likely. FOX will not want to risk losing its
<br>
existing market share. FOX serves an important market niche. Speaking as a
<br>
capitalist, I think it should do everything in its power to hold on to it.
<br>
<p>I have a theory about why the non-cable news media tends to be biased to the
<br>
left: the majority of American news consumers are biased to the left, and
<br>
the news media is merely a product designed to meet consumer demand. Notice
<br>
that I did not say the majority of American *voters*.
