</em><br>
<p>Yes and no. In the real world outside of the laboratory, compliance is a
<br>
serious matter whether it be about diets or about the taking of medications.
<br>
These researchers attempted wisely, I think, to create a real world
<br>
environment for testing. They deliberately avoided the temptation to hassle
<br>
the test subjects unduly about compliance. They were testing not only the
<br>
theoretical efficacy of Atkins, but also its real world efficacy. After all,
<br>
if no person can stay on the greatest possible diet then obviously that diet
<br>
has value in the real world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can we accept these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results after a year when we don't even know what diet these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people were on?
</em><br>
<p>They did report in periodically, so there was some accountability. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aren't you concerned that they found no correlation between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ketosis and weight loss? 
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm not surprised. As you may recall I do not believe ketosis is
<br>
necessary for weight loss. This is one area in which I depart from Atkins.
<br>
In fact I believe ketosis is unhealthy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, they concluded that the macronutrient ratio 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of calories had no effect.  Doesn't this refute the entire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premise of the Atkins diet?
</em><br>
<p>I think their own data refutes that sentence. Atkins was found to be
<br>
significantly superior for weight loss after 3 months, after 6 months, and
<br>
almost significantly superior after one year. So then 2 out of 3 statistical
<br>
tests showed Atkins to be superior to the conventional diet. It's a shame
<br>
they didn't continue the testing into the second year.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, all of the measurements seemed to converge and get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more similar toward the end of the year.  I think this was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to people not following the diets.  
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. But the Atkins dieters still lost about twice as much
<br>
weight on average after one year than the conventional dieters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Longer durations would probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the diets even more indistinguishable.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; That said, I think Atkins is only a half-step in the right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; direction. I applaud the late Dr. Atkins for eliminating agricultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; products but I wish he had taken the next step: the elimination of dairy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I applaud him for suggesting high protein and low carbs.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just wish he would have taken the next step:  the elimination 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of high levels of saturated fats.
</em><br>
<p>And where do think most of the calories from non-paleolithic dairy products
<br>
come from? :)
