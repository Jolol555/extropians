<em>&gt; No matter who it comes from. Harvey, you are more guilty, because as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see in your discussion with Brian, you are treating an article on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; betterhumans website as if it is a scientific study
</em><br>
<p>I gave no such credit to the article.  What you are quoting was Brian's
<br>
guess about what could have caused the confusion.  He correctly guessed that
<br>
he and I were probably reading different papers.  He guessed that I was
<br>
reading this article and not the study he quoted.  Actually, I was reading
<br>
the other study quoted in this article, and not the article itself.  But the
<br>
outcome was the same.  Brian and I were not talking about the same study
<br>
when we discussed it.  That is why our comments did not agree about what the
<br>
study said.  I agree with Brian's interpretation of the study he described,
<br>
and I have no dispute with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; yet you are claiming that Brian is baiting and switching
</em><br>
<p>I made no such accusation.  I do not suspect Brian of any wrongdoing, nor
<br>
did I think he was deliberately causing the confusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you are continuing to claim your original reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which was based on Brians reference) is the proper interpretation.
</em><br>
<p>I made no such claim.  My reference was not based on Brian's reference.
<br>
Brian and I each looked at separate studies that were both quoted in the
<br>
original news report.  As such, neither of us has the &quot;proper&quot;
<br>
interpretation.  I believe we both accurately represented different studies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Talk about dogmatic orthodoxy. All hail the vegan religion...
</em><br>
<p>? I'm not sure what this means.  Vegetarianism didn't enter into the
<br>
discussion Brian and I had.  I would be interested if you think any of my
<br>
claims were pushing my diet or based on some religious belief.  I am
<br>
certainly not aware of anything like that occurring.  (The reason this
<br>
comment confuses me, is that I will be the first to admit that there is no
<br>
compelling reason why anybody else should become vegetarian.  This is a
<br>
personal choice I have made, but I do not believe it is correct for
<br>
everybody.  Therefore, I find it difficult to believe that I was pushing an
<br>
agenda that I do not personally hold.)
