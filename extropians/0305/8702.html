<p><em>&gt; GTS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        As I understand the theory of humor, a joke results at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point where reality intersects with what the comedian is saying.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words the comedian has to say something that intersects the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known world.  I see all sorts of humor where the only intersection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with reality is the name or image the comedian attaches to the joke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        For example, I could take Clinton's image or name and attach a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally unrelated joke to that image or name.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm no expert on the &quot;the theory of humor,&quot; but I do know what makes
<br>
me laugh. 
<br>
<p>Leno still manages to squeeze a laugh out of me from the occasional Lewinsky
<br>
joke. Such jokes are certainly not as you say a matter only of humor &quot;where
<br>
the only intersection with reality is the name or image the comedian
<br>
attaches to the joke.&quot; Lewinsky jokes don't make much sense with Bush's name
<br>
inserted, for example.
<br>
<p>Similarly, when Leno makes a joke about Bill O'Reilly thinking he's God,
<br>
that's funny to me because it strikes a chord with my view of reality.
<br>
Evidently it is likely to strike a similar chord with a lot of other people,
<br>
as evidenced by the huge popular success of Jay Leno.
<br>
<p>But the same joke would not be funny if it was about, say, Pee Wee Herman.
<br>
Of course there are a lot of jokes about Pee Wee Herman that would make me
<br>
laugh, but jokes about him thinking he's God would not be among them.
