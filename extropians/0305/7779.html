<p>### I doubt that there would be a substantial acreage devoted to MJ and

coca, since the demand (on a kilogram per thousand citizens) is quite low,

much lower than the demand for e.g. grain. At the same time, drug-induced

bliss and strokes (from cocaine) would reduce the activity of many humans

who otherwise interfere with deer by driving around and proliferating.
<br>
Predicting the exact balance of outcomes seems to be beyond our little

discussion here.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep. In response to the hunters' claim that their hunting (which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have always done anyway) is the only &quot;rational wildlife management&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can prevent overpopulation &amp; starvation of wild animals. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of an alternative (which some have implemented, not me, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not officially that I know of) disproves their point.
</em><br>
<p>### To quote a previous statement of yours, (Fri May 02 2003 - 14:17:19
<br>
MDT):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't propose policy, because I am in no position to create public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy or even affect it by any significant amount. I suspect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same is true of you
</em><br>
&lt;my answer is quoted above&gt;
<br>
<p>It appears to me that you made this statement not to disprove the hunters'
<br>
claim (it is nowhere to be found quoted in your post), but rather as a
<br>
general remark. And as a general remark it is quite hard to accept. In fact,
<br>
I doubt that there is a single Extropian who would be willing to believe,
<br>
based on your stated convictions, that you would not vote or lobby for legal
<br>
restrictions on hunting.
<br>
----------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ### What kind of evidence would you like to offer in support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; What evidence would you expect? I have a cousin who is a hunter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I've never heard him exclaim, &quot;Wow, I caught a really scrawny,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; young, lame one today! Me big hunter!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Hearsay!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you are telling me all hunters deliberately try to catch the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inferior animals?
</em><br>
<p>### As Mike noted, what hunters try is one thing, and what they get is
<br>
something else altogether.
<br>
<p>What they boast about is even farther away from the truth :-)
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### If enough people are really concerned about the welfare of deer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and truly want to help them by sterilization, you will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; gather enough funds. Of course, it's easier to ask the local
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; congressman to do pay for it with other people's money, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I might be digressing here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People don't know what they want. Hunters know they want to hunt, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the political system is designed to match their intentions. Animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lovers are too disorganized, politically naive or unconnected, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no political system (machine) in place. What people *want*, and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of them want it, is of only partial relevance to what happens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People don't want smog in their cities, either, but there it is.
</em><br>
<p>### You've been roundly castigated for this &quot;People don't know...&quot; remark,
<br>
so I won't add much here, aside from noting that restrictions on hunting are
<br>
being quite widely adopted, as a result of the relentless pressure from
<br>
greenish organizations.
<br>
<p>No, freedom haters are neither disorganized, naive, nor unconnected.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### If you were to say that hunters actually are *not* like child
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; molesters, I could retract my assessment of your beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have to retract something I didn't say :) I said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *remunerating* hunters for not being able to hunt would be like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remunerating child molesters for not being able to molest children. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect hunters would be rather above being bribed anyway - they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hunt - no amount of money would satisfy them to give up hunting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And there is an analogy to that for child molesters, too. And to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position - I would not accept any payment from hunters to compensate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their devastation, because that would be utterly irrelevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Wow, we are getting here into industrial-strength hair-splitting!
<br>
<p>I would bet that the majority of the readers of your initial statement:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; more than I would feel the need to remunerate child molestors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; depriving them of the ability to molest children.
</em><br>
<p>would see it as putting hunters into the same class as child molesters, an
<br>
expression of scorn, and possibly a psychological manipulation, well beyond
<br>
the tame interpretation you advanced above.
<br>
<p>Just admit it - you hate hunters! :-)
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; ### As in: &quot;We just voted that you can't hunt, here or everywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It makes us quite happy to vote, you know.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I noted before that your ethics is incommensurate with mine, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think the difference lies not in the superficialities of money but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the value of freedom - this is the bedrock of my ethics, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yours. It leads to happiness, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMHO freedom is a means to an end, not an end. Freedom not exercised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, thoughtfully, beneficially, with other goals in mind, is just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blank check of power. It can be abused, lost, sold to the highest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bidder.
</em><br>
<p>### But what is the end to which we have freedom? Happiness? Thoughtfulness?
<br>
Beneficence?
<br>
<p>Why bother being happy?
<br>
<p>Life, freedom and truth, for their own sake, are what I want, all else is a
<br>
bonus.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Blowing a hole in the brain isn't painful. Being shot in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chest with a large caliber hunting rifle for a human is hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; painful at all in the beginning (there are descriptions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; survivors), so animals couldn't feel much pain, either. Much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than the pain of being eaten alive by a wildcat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any pain caused by humans is pain the humans are responsible for, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if unnecessary, it is their fault, and its meaning and significance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well known to humans, and cannot be blamed on instinctive nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as wildcats). I would remind you that not all hunted animals are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed with a single shot to the head (pace hunters' intentions), or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed in a single instant. It's my understanding that many hunters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually enjoy trailing the wounded animal. Also, it is illogical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue that any wild animal not shot by a hunter would immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then otherwise be eaten alive by a wildcat. There is such a thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living a longer life, having more enjoyable experiences, that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insignificant to the animal and should not be insignificant to us.
</em><br>
<p>### You are anthropomorphizing deer. They do not attach significance to a
<br>
longer life, since they do not have the concept of a time-invariant self.
<br>
Therefore killing them is ethically neutral, and if it results on average in
<br>
reduced suffering (freedom from wildcats, diseases of old age, accidents,
<br>
etc), like a shot to the heart, it is clearly ethically superior.
<br>
<p>Attaching ethical significance to longer life of deer is like attaching
<br>
significance to the wishes of inanimate objects, so common in animists.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### You can have fun doing the rational thing, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Only Puritans though anything that feels good must be bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh no, I am sure feeding and sterilizing wild animals is quite fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I bet it also makes a person feel good inside, proud of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves and their compassionate relationship with the animals.
</em><br>
<p>### How many deer have you sterilized? Was it fun?
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### But deer are fungible automatons, not irreplaceable individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or sentimentally important works of art.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is the proof of the incommensurability of our philosophies. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement is the exact opposite of what I believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### Deer are &quot;individuals&quot;? How do you know? How many have you talked to?
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ### The developers have only as much money as their clients are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; willing to pay. If clients become rich enough to dream about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unspoiled nature, they will build it, too. It's all a question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; demand and supply. If human happiness demands the last inch to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; built up, or every inch to be turned into a forest, the market will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; provide. Really.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The market will provide&quot; has almost a religious ring to it. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market will not provide me or anyone else Tasmanian wolves or woolly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammoths, no matter how much I would be willing to pay for them (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe me, there are people in this world who would and could pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast fortunes for them).
</em><br>
<p>### Just wait a few decades and even this will be possible, thanks to the
<br>
market-driven and government-supported progress of science. All you need is
<br>
to clone the DNA, assemble it into a genome, and voila, you have your
<br>
mammoth steak, and T.Rex-safari.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some stupid mistakes are irrevocable. And wiser folks cannot always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere and rich enough to buy off fools.
</em><br>
<p>### Yep, this is right.
