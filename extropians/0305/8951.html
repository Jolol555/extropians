<p>Depends on what you mean. According to Mohandas Gandhi, armed revolt was a 
<br>
possibility he kept firmly in mind. That he wound up emphasizing 
<br>
nonviolence doesn't mean it wasn't also on the Viceroy's mind.
<br>
<p>Then, as I mentioned recently, there's Iran. Perhaps it happened because 
<br>
the Pahlavi government wasn't sufficiently oppressive. You can always make 
<br>
that claim about any successfl revolution.
<br>
<p>And of course Cuba, if you buy the Guevaran/Castroan party line regarding 
<br>
Batista. And the Soviet Union. And Mao against the warlords and Kuomintang. 
<br>
Hey, if it works for Commies, why not for non-Commies?
<br>
<p>And what about the Roundheads?
<br>
<p>Does it count if any troops wind up siding with the revolutionaries, or do 
<br>
they have to do it all by themselves with kitchen chemicals and farm 
<br>
implements?

<p><em>&gt; While I support the 2nd ammendment, my feeling is that pragmatically it 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Feelings are good. I feel you are wrong, and that there is a certain 
<br>
general orneriness (deterrence) effect in some of the extant USA 
<br>
subpopulations until or unless the polity comes to accept a degree of 
<br>
savagery on the part of the authorities that makes the matter moot. There 
<br>
was a town in Tennessee shortly after WWII, I seem to recall, where armed 
<br>
citizens forced a corrupt local government to stop throwing an election.
<br>
<p>An analogy: the aggregate odds on resuscitation via CPR are given as about 
<br>
25%. Does that mean that no sensible person would ever administer it?
