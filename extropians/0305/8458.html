</em><br>
<p>To which Samantha responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;It was precisely that and I did root for its end.  So what?  I had no 
<br>
great effect on what happened after we pulled out.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then let us at this point clarify a point of contention. In your view, did 
<br>
you have any effect on what happened BEFORE we pulled out?
<br>
<p>&quot;Nothing I or others like me said was likely to have made a lot of difference 
<br>
<p>except where US involvment actually made the problem much worse in 
<br>
the region as in our support of the Khmer Rouge.&quot;
<br>
<p>Our &quot;support&quot; of the Khmer Rouge made things worse? As opposed to the 
<br>
continued interference in Cambodia by the Communist Vietnamese government, 
<br>
which violated the neutrality of that country in 1965 and then in 1979 
<br>
proceeded to invade and occupy it, replacing a system of horrific mass murder 
<br>
and repression with one of less mass murder but similar levels of repression? 
<br>
Bravo, Le Duan. And more to the point, our support in Cambodia was for all of 
<br>
the factions aligned against the Vietnamese occupying forces, not simply the 
<br>
Khmer Rouge. This was a position, I might add, held by over 110 member states 
<br>
of the sacrosanct United Nations.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now clearly, by your own criteria, promoting something that leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the death of people means you must bare some of the blame for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Nope, that is a poor characterization.  Unlike Mr. Fumento I did not 
<br>
promote myself as any sort of expert.   One who promotes themselves 
<br>
as an expert and adviser on a problem does have greater 
<br>
responsibility.&quot;
<br>
<p>So you would suggest that while say, you, apparently have no culpability, 
<br>
someone such as Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Ramsey Clark, or Noam Chomsky might?
<br>
<p>&quot;I will grant however that it was wrong of me to 
<br>
personally hold him responsible for millions of deaths.&quot;
<br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p>&quot;Instead I simply hold him as an undependable, irresponsible and amoral 
<br>
opportunist posturing as an expert.  Such people do cause great harm.&quot;
<br>
<p>As they did in Indochina, and continue to do there by pretending a positive 
<br>
outcome occured.
<br>
<p><p><p>I
<br>
<em>&gt; I certainly take issue with the accuracy of your summation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fumento's points, so perhaps you take issue with the accuracy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of my points, thus clearing you of any blame for the millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of deaths in Indochina.  I would like to know which points you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I won't wate my time on such.  That war is over and done with and I 
<br>
have *much* better things to do than rehash it with you.&quot;
<br>
<p>The military campaign has been concluded for some time, yes. Just as in the 
<br>
case of Iraq, but you wish to &quot;rehash&quot; that conflict. People, such as 
<br>
yourself, can and have successfully argued that it is too early to tell if in 
<br>
the long term our effort in Iraq will be a complete success. It is not too 
<br>
early, however, to state unequivocally that the efforts of the Communists in 
<br>
Indochina were a complete and utter failure that brought death and misery to 
<br>
millions of people. &quot;The war&quot; for those people is not over, because they are 
<br>
still ruled by despotic and barbaric thugs. Do you criticize the US 
<br>
government's trade agreement with Vietnam signed by President Clinton, or do 
<br>
you support economic relations with mass murderering petty tyrants so long as 
<br>
they aren't named Saddam Hussein? You continue to criticize vehemently the 
<br>
Bush administration's efforts in Iraq, and yet, it is more likely than not 
<br>
that a democratic election will be held in that country long before one is 
<br>
ever held in Vietnam or Laos.
<br>
