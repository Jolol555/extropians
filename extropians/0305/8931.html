<p>Yes, this is a constant irritation for me. Here in Sweden I'm a liberal, 
<br>
on the list I'm a libertarian. Of course, by Swedish standards the 
<br>
american socialists are at most right-wing social democrats. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He also appears to have a long chapter on the socialist component

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to say, I do note that except for the Nazis, none of the usual

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the propriety of placing the Nazis entirely on the right wing may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be questioned.  Admittedly, in their nationalism, elitism, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their version of eugenics, the Nazis were right-wing; but in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their collectivism and theory of government, they were clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left-wing.
</em><br>
<p>It becomes confusing when mapped onto a one-dimensional left-right
<br>
scale, but think of the Nolan chart, and it becomes rather trivial:
<br>
nazism and fascism are simply the result of moving from the &quot;little
<br>
economic freedom/social freedom&quot; part of socialism to the authoritarian
<br>
corner of no freedom in either direction (also, 30's socialism was
<br>
rather low from the start on social freedoms). It should not be any
<br>
surprise that both Hitler and Mussolini had a past within left wing
<br>
political parties. Also, the move to authoritarianism worked politically
<br>
because it could draw on similarities with pre-existing political
<br>
sentiments within conservative and authoritarian movements, getting 
<br>
almost everybody to feel that there was at least some good ideas in that 
<br>
mess.
<br>
<p>This might be relevant for doing preventative memetic gardening of one's 
<br>
own civil society. I personally think you Americans should take a 
<br>
serious look at the neo-con program, just as we Europeans better guard 
<br>
against &quot;national social democracy&quot; and &quot;national liberalism&quot;.
