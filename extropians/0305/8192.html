<br>
communists and even Nazis were probably more misguided then deliberately 
<br>
dishonest.  Humans usually tend to believe in what they are doing, no matter 
<br>
how obviously wrong it seems to others.  Where disagreements arise, it is 
<br>
human nature to assume the other side is deliberately being dishonest.

stupidity.&quot;

<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, you have a very good point.  Even on this list I find people 
<br>
making fundamental errors because they don't understand how our system works 
<br>
even when it is operating legally and properly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even here people report the raw vote of our last Presidential election 
<br>
as if it were the total popular vote -- it was not.  We count votes until the 
<br>
results cannot be changed by the remaining vote that is uncounted.  The 
<br>
remaining uncounted vote is thrown away.  In our last Presidential election 
<br>
it is reliably reported that millions of votes were never counted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My best guess is that Gore would have retained the popular lead if we 
<br>
had counted every last vote.  I can't prove that.  The political apparatus 
<br>
working in the polls said, &quot;That is enough&quot; when not enough votes remained in 
<br>
a jurisdiction to give Gore the victory in that jurisdiction.
