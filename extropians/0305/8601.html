<p><em>&gt; The very fact that we have scarcity is crazy. Why isn't our environment

</em><br>
<p>It's possible that such an &quot;easy&quot; universe would not have been suitable
<br>
for the emergence of intelligent life.
<br>
<p>With so much power and flexibility, the universe might even be too
<br>
chaotic and random to allow life itself to form.  Even if life could
<br>
begin, it would quickly evolve to exploit the &quot;magical&quot; potentialities
<br>
of the universe if they could be so easily accessed.  It could fill in
<br>
the niches so well that there would be little evolutionary pressure for
<br>
complexity and ultimately intelligence.
<br>
<p>It might well be that the ideal universe is not too different from what we
<br>
see: one that allows life to form and evolve, but with enough difficulty
<br>
that a huge number of different strategies and structures are explored;
<br>
one that rewards intelligence with incredible powers, but sets the bar
<br>
so high that unintelligent life cannot manipulate these potentialities;
<br>
and one that leaves the universe mostly empty, so that once intelligent
<br>
life does form and develop the potential to spread, it has vast rewards
<br>
for doing so.
<br>
<p>One of the ideas I have played with is that the universe is likely not
<br>
lawful.  It would be expected to approximate physical laws but to have
<br>
rare exceptions.  The reasoning is that universes with simple physical
<br>
laws are likely to be more probable than those with complex ones; but
<br>
that the number of different universes with complex laws is greater,
<br>
approximately cancelling this effect.
<br>
<p>To get life and evolution, you need relatively simple laws, so that
<br>
the universe is predictable and structured.  But there would also be
<br>
universes with basically simple laws that also have complex exceptions -
<br>
so called &quot;white rabbit&quot; universes, as the concept has been discussed
<br>
on Wei's Everything list - universes where magic exists.  The total
<br>
collection of white rabbit universes of all forms is roughly equal in
<br>
size to the simple ones.  So we could be living in such a universe.
<br>
<p>Along the lines above, access to the magic cannot be too easy, or
<br>
intelligent life cannot evolve.  So the anthropic principle rules out
<br>
those universes.  That leaves those for which magic is possible, but
<br>
only with the aid of intelligence.  We might live in such a universe.
<br>
<p>Going forward, then, I would not be surprised if our efforts to
<br>
create a Theory of Everything are thwarted by the discovery of rare
<br>
exceptions.  And it's possible that we could exploit these loopholes
<br>
through technology.  Or it could be that the conditions to trigger
<br>
exceptional behavior are so rare that we never find them - the key to
<br>
Magic forever unobtainable.  Maybe our descendants will spend some of
<br>
their vast resources constantly probing the fundamental laws, looking
<br>
to see if there is a flaw, like a hacker searching for back doors into
<br>
his target system.
