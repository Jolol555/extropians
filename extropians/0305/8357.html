<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the Lancet data is that it's heavily skewed towards the

pneumonia, and second it all comes from a single source. Had they done the

EU cases.  Obviously the SARS death rate is heavily dependent on the quality

of hospital care.  The 20% fatality rate of SARS is 20% *in Hong Kong*.  Any
<br>
idea what the fatality rate is for post industrialized west nations with

decent health care systems?  Answer, 0%  See -

<p>Regards,

<p>Michael Dickey
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.fumento.com/advise.html">http://www.fumento.com/advise.html</a> (posted today)
<br>
<p>The spread of SARS continues to slow and at less than 7,739 cases and 611
<br>
cases it's still just a bit shy of the 1918-1919 flu pandemic (with 40
<br>
million deaths) to which the media is wont to compare this new disease. So
<br>
it wasn't surprising that they jumped all over a new study published in The
<br>
Lancet online indicating that the fatality rate for SARS might be much
<br>
higher than would seem by simply dividing deaths by cases. Indeed, said the
<br>
study, the death rate could be as high as 20 percent. But there are just a
<br>
few minor problems here. First, the subjects in the study were
<br>
disproportionately among the elderly. SARS, like all pathogens that kill
<br>
primarily through pneumonia, picks on old people. Indeed, The Lancet study
<br>
found &quot;The estimated case fatality rate for patients younger than 60 years
<br>
was 13.2% and 43.3% for patients aged 60 years and older.&quot; Second, not only
<br>
did all of these patients come from a single city, a huge percentage came
<br>
from a single place in that city - the now-infamous Amoy Gardens apartment
<br>
complex. Third, as the study also was careful to note, it could only look at
<br>
hospitalized persons. How many times have you had the flu? How many times
<br>
have you sought a doctor's care for it? Right. Surely it's the same with
<br>
SARS. As with flu, probably the vast majority of people who contract it
<br>
never get any medical attention; they simply recover on their own. Taking
<br>
that into account, even looking at worldwide cases versus deaths probably
<br>
grossly overstates the SARS death rate.
<br>
<p>Finally, if the study had instead chosen as its subjects all persons in the
<br>
U.S., Europe, and Australia with SARS it would have found 109 cases as of
<br>
May 15 with no deaths. For the mathematically challenged, that's a zero
<br>
percent death rate. Obviously, the quality of medical care dramatically
<br>
impacts the death rate. In any case, it makes no more sense to extrapolate
<br>
from a portion of Hong Kong cases to the world as it does to extrapolate
<br>
from all U.S., European, and Australian cases to the world. That would be
<br>
like basing your odds of contracting malaria in Zaire based on malaria cases
<br>
in New York or vice-versa. So the best data remain those WHO posts daily on
<br>
its website. Not that the media or public health officials care anything
<br>
about all this. They've got sales and budget increases to worry about.
