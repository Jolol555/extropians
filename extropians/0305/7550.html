<p>Good idea.  Perhaps however there is a point where
<br>
efficiency is irrelevant.  Robert points out that
<br>
vegetarianism is the most efficient means of getting
<br>
ATP into the human brain, however there are those
<br>
who may argue that in this context, efficiency is
<br>
not the quantity to be maximized.  In a like manner
<br>
suppose an AI is trying to maximize *something* but
<br>
it isn't clear exactly what is to be maximized.
<br>
<p>We once discussed here a map of all the possible
<br>
singularity futures.  This is another entry for
<br>
the list or matrix or singularity state space:
<br>
<p>An intelligent species (ours or one like ours) evolves
<br>
to the point where individuals network and combine
<br>
their intelligence ever more effectively, create
<br>
an AI which forms a Jbrain.  For reasons that we
<br>
do not (or perhaps cannot) understand, the Jbrain
<br>
decides it is unethical to devour every planet in
<br>
the galaxy.  It decides instead to play with us.
<br>
It wants to maximize *fun*.
<br>
<p>It plays god, by seeking out strange new civilizations,
<br>
reading the intelligences found there and simulating
<br>
their thought processes.  It then runs ahead of the
<br>
remaining meat-brains, anticipates their every want
<br>
and need, causing them to have wonderful and comfortable
<br>
lives.  Its payback is to sit back and laugh at the
<br>
wonderful silliness of a species such as mankind.
<br>
<p>The simulated and anticipated species come to
<br>
believe in god, such that the species drops its progress
<br>
towards its own (possibly competing) Jbrain.
