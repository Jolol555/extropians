Considerable attention has been focused on Wigner's famous essay
<br>
&quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html</a>
<br>
<p>It seems to me that we should look at this from a different point of
<br>
view, namely, instead of being about mathematics, it's more a statement
<br>
about ourselves.  In other words, how little different could our
<br>
universe be so that no one like Wigner would make such an observation?
<br>
<p>Perhaps St. Thomas Aquinas, had he lived longer or was slightly
<br>
less devout, might have written an essay on &quot;The Unreasonable
<br>
Ineffectiveness of Prayer&quot;.
<br>
<p>Surely when Wigner and others are astounded by the relevance of 
<br>
mathematics to our investigations, it simply means that we would
<br>
be less surprised if math was less relevant, so let's assume for
<br>
a moment that we lived in such a world (and in the multiverse,
<br>
surely somewhere we do, although with perhaps low measure).  In
<br>
other words, the last six or seven centuries since St. Thomas
<br>
would have unfolded in less astonishing ways, and precisely as
<br>
many people would be amazed by the ineffectiveness of
<br>
mathematics as would be amazed by its effectiveness.
<br>
<p>Perhaps all this means nothing more than that the forces which
<br>
shaped us evolutionarily weren't very mathematical?
