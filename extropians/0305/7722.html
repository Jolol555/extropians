<em>&gt; I was referring to the original URL being discussed:

<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-05-02-2">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-05-02-2</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was not referring to the URL you posted in response to the previous URL:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm">http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are applying my response to the wrong posting!
</em><br>
<p>The original URL was not a &quot;study&quot;. It was a piece of reporting. It had 
<br>
quotes from scientists who as far as I can tell did not even work on the 
<br>
two studies. At any rate, my comments were not about the reporting, but 
<br>
rather the underlying studies, most specifically the second one 
<br>
mentioned. So again I ask, which study were you referring to with your 
<br>
comments?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Go read the key findings page again:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm">http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That study has nothing to do with any of my comments.  I have neither read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor responded to that study.  Looking at it now, I don't see anything there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I would dispute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am obviously missing something... I don't understand. You replied to 
<br>
Mike and claimed that I was reinterpreting the &quot;studies&quot; (i.e. plural) 
<br>
to say the opposite of their results. What exactly were you talking 
<br>
about? Did you mean to say that I was reinterpreting what the news 
<br>
article said?
<br>
<p>I clearly stated in my original post to Bill K that I was discussing the 
<br>
underlying studies, not the BH article. I even mentioned going to the 
<br>
web pages of them. So I am still not understanding your complaints 
<br>
regarding my post.
