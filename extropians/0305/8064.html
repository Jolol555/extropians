As We See It
<br>
&quot;Eating Food Cooked At High Temperature Accelerates Aging&quot;
<br>
by William Faloon
<br>
<p>&nbsp;new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1
<br>
reveals that eating foods cooked at high temperature may increase the rate
<br>
at which we age. According to this study, the ingestion of high temperature
<br>
cooked foods causes chronic inflammation and the formation of advanced
<br>
glycation end products.
<br>
<p>Life Extension members have been frequently warned about the dangers of
<br>
chronic inflammation and glycation. For the benefit of new members, I will
<br>
succinctly explain these two lethal processes.
<br>
<p><p>As humans age, there is a systemic increase in inflammatory cytokines
<br>
(destructive cell-signaling chemicals) that contribute to many degenerative
<br>
diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis is a classic disorder where excess levels of
<br>
cytokines cause or contribute to the destructive inflammatory syndrome.
<br>
While inflammatory cytokines can cause agonizing pain, they also disrupt the
<br>
linings of our arteries, mutate DNA and degrade brain cells. Chronic
<br>
inflammation is directly involved in diseases as diverse as cancer,
<br>
atherosclerosis, diabetes, aortic valve stenosis, congestive heart failure,
<br>
Alzheimer's disease and kidney impairment.
<br>
<p>In aging people with multiple degenerative diseases, we often find elevated
<br>
blood levels of C-reactive protein, indicating the presence of an
<br>
inflammatory disorder. When a cytokine blood profile is conducted in these
<br>
individuals, we usually discover excess levels of one or more of the
<br>
pro-inflammatory cytokines. The most common pro-inflammatory cytokines are
<br>
tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1(b) and/or
<br>
interleukin-8.
<br>
<p>Chronic inflammation inflicts devastating effects, especially as humans grow
<br>
older. The lethal consequences of inflammation are clearly established in
<br>
the medical literature.2-14 The good news is that many of the nutrients,
<br>
hormones and drugs being taken by Life Extension members suppress the
<br>
production of these deadly inflammatory cytokines. As you will soon read,
<br>
avoiding foods cooked at very high temperatures can also reduce production
<br>
of inflammatory cytokines.
<br>
<p>Age-accelerating effects of glycation
<br>
<p>The other pathological aging mechanism exacerbated by eating high
<br>
temperature cooked food is the formation of advanced glycation end products
<br>
(A.G.E.'s). Glycation can be described as the binding of a protein molecule
<br>
to a glucose molecule resulting in the formation of damaged protein
<br>
structures. Many age-related diseases such as arterial stiffening, cataract
<br>
and neurological impairment are at least partially attributable to
<br>
glycation. These destructive glycation reactions render proteins in the body
<br>
crosslinked and barely functional. As these degraded proteins accumulate,
<br>
they cause cells to emit signals that induce the production of inflammatory
<br>
cytokines.
<br>
<p>The glycation process is presently irreversible, though a recent study
<br>
indicates a drug in clinical trials may be partially effective. Life
<br>
Extension members take supplements to help protect against glycation.
<br>
According to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study,
<br>
consuming foods cooked at high temperature accelerates the glycation
<br>
process, and the subsequent formation of A.G.E.'s.
<br>
<p>A more succinct descriptive term for &quot;advanced glycation end products&quot; is
<br>
&quot;glycotoxin&quot;, since &quot;advanced glycation end products&quot; are toxic to the body.
<br>
We will use the word &quot;glycotoxin&quot; from here on to describe the term
<br>
&quot;advanced glycation end products&quot;.
<br>
<p>Cooking and aging have similar biological properties
<br>
<p>Cooking foods at high temperatures results in a &quot;browning&quot; effect, where
<br>
sugars and certain oxidized fats react with proteins to form glycotoxins in
<br>
the food. Normal aging can also be regarded as a slow cooking process, since
<br>
these same glycotoxins form in the skin, arteries, eye lenses, joints,
<br>
cartilage, etc. of our body.
<br>
<p><p>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study shows that
<br>
consuming foods high in glycotoxins might be responsible for the induction
<br>
of a low-grade, but chronic state of inflammation. In addition, the
<br>
glycotoxins in food cooked at high temperatures also promote the formation
<br>
of glycotoxins in our living tissues. The implication of these findings is
<br>
profound.
<br>
<p>Feeding foods rich in glycotoxins to diabetics
<br>
<p>The presence of glycotoxins in the blood of individuals with diabetes has
<br>
been known for quite some time.15 To ascertain reasons for this, a group of
<br>
diabetics were studied to assess the difference between consuming a diet
<br>
high in glycotoxins compared to diet low in glycotoxins. The high glycotoxin
<br>
diet was induced by heating food for a longer period at higher temperatures
<br>
compared to the lower glycotoxin diet. Using a variety of foods, the
<br>
scientists were able to increase the glycotoxin content five-fold by cooking
<br>
the food at high temperatures.
<br>
<p>After only two weeks, diabetics on the high glycotoxin diet showed a 50% to
<br>
100% increase of glycotoxins in their blood and urine compared to the group
<br>
consuming the low glycotoxin diet. The group eating the high glycotoxin food
<br>
also showed increased levels of inflammatory blood markers such C-reactive
<br>
protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha.
<br>
In order to determine whether these significant changes were merely an acute
<br>
response to an altered diet, the scientists carried out a second study that
<br>
lasted for six weeks. Again, those consuming a diet high in glycotoxins had
<br>
higher concentrations of glycotoxins in their bodies, along with increased
<br>
inflammatory cytokines in their blood.
<br>
<p>The researchers also found that eating diets low in glycotoxins reduced the
<br>
level of other potentially harmful substances in the blood, including LDL
<br>
cholesterol (&quot;bad cholesterol&quot;). During the two-week, low-glycotoxin diet,
<br>
diabetics had lower LDL levels than those on a high-glycotoxin diet. A
<br>
six-week, low-glycotoxin diet caused a 33% reduction of LDL, while a
<br>
high-glycotoxin diet increased LDL by 32%.
<br>
<p>Aging control and weight loss
<br>
<p>This study on human diabetics raises intriguing possibilities of preventing
<br>
disease and slowing aging via proper food preparation. First of all,
<br>
previous studies have shown that caloric restriction prolongs life span in
<br>
rodents while simultaneously decreasing glycotoxin formation in body
<br>
tissues.16 There is now considerable evidence that the same glycotoxin
<br>
formation that occurs during cooking also occurs inside the body during
<br>
normal aging17 and at an accelerated rate in diabetics.18 For example,
<br>
glycotoxins accumulate faster in the skin collagen of diabetics compared to
<br>
non-diabetics.19 We also know that glycotoxins engage cell receptors in such
<br>
as way as to promote tumor growth and metastasis (via mechanisms that
<br>
stimulate cell migration, tumor cell growth factors and enzymes that digest
<br>
the extracellular matrix).20
<br>
<p>While this study on human diabetics is preliminary and needs confirmatory
<br>
results in healthy populations, there were other benefits associated with
<br>
consuming a low glycotoxin diet. Not only did the diabetics consuming the
<br>
low glycotoxin diet lose weight, but their blood glucose levels also
<br>
dropped. In the group eating the high glycotoxin diet, blood glucose levels
<br>
increased. Elevated glucose levels can trigger production of deadly
<br>
inflammatory cytokines.
<br>
It should be noted that the number of calories, carbohydrates, proteins and
<br>
fat was the same in both the high and low glycotoxin diets. The diabetics
<br>
consuming the low glycotoxin diet, however, lost weight. It is well known
<br>
that reducing excess weight and glucose levels confers longer life.
<br>
<p>Reversing glycation
<br>
<p>In the August 2001 issue of this magazine, an article reported on a compound
<br>
called ALT-711 that has been shown to partially reverse glycation.
<br>
Regrettably, the company (Alteon, Inc.) trying to get ALT-711 through the
<br>
FDA's approval process is woefully under funded, and clinical studies have
<br>
progressed at a snail's pace.
<br>
<p>On January 21, 2003, some encouraging results were announced from a
<br>
preliminary analysis of a Phase II clinical trial evaluating the activity of
<br>
ALT-711 in treating diastolic heart failure. The significance of these
<br>
results is that diastolic heart failure (DHF) is one of the most common
<br>
types of heart failure in the elderly. DHF is a poorly treated medical
<br>
condition that is characterized by the inability of the heart to relax
<br>
properly and fill with blood, due to stiffening (glycation) of the heart and
<br>
subsequent impaired relaxation of the left ventricle. Diastolic dysfunction
<br>
is estimated to account for 30% to 50% of all heart failure cases, which
<br>
total nearly five million cases in the U.S. alone.
<br>
<p>In this Phase II clinical trial, DHF patients who received ALT-711 for 16
<br>
weeks experienced a statistically significant reduction in left ventricular
<br>
mass. The patients also had a marked improvement in left ventricular
<br>
diastolic filling. Additionally, the drug had a positive effect on patients'
<br>
quality of life, as measured by a well-established heart failure/quality of
<br>
life questionnaire. This Phase II trial is ongoing, and additional analyses
<br>
of the data are being conducted. Here is a quote about the significance of
<br>
this study:
<br>
<p>&quot;ALT-711 offers promise as a novel therapy for diastolic heart failure
<br>
because currently available therapies do not specifically target the
<br>
stiffening heart and vessel walls caused by pathological glucose-protein
<br>
matrixes called Advanced Glycosylation End-product (A.G.E.) Crosslinks. The
<br>
formation of A.G.E. Crosslinks is a natural part of the aging process that
<br>
can lead to stiffening and loss of function in tissues, organs and vessels
<br>
including the heart and large arteries. In previous human clinical testing,
<br>
ALT-711 has shown the ability to restore elasticity to blood vessel walls by
<br>
cleaving A.G.E. Crosslinks.* Additionally, in several preclinical studies
<br>
ALT-711 has been shown to normalize the thickening of the left ventricle and
<br>
remodel the heart.&quot;**
<br>
<p>(Please note that these researchers use the term Advanced Glycosylation
<br>
End-product (A.G.E.), which is another way of stating advanced glycation end
<br>
products or &quot;glycotoxins&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Life Extension has long argued that the high cost of gaining FDA-approval
<br>
denies Americans access to life-saving compounds such as ALT-711.*** It can
<br>
take so long for a new compound to become an approved &quot;drug&quot;, that many
<br>
companies run out of capital before they are able to comply with the FDA's
<br>
Byzantine regulatory procedures. The result is that Americans die even
<br>
though potentially effective therapies sit in the FDA's waiting room.
<br>
<p>Since we cannot yet reverse the pathological effects of glycation, it
<br>
becomes critical for those seeking to prevent premature aging to at least
<br>
slow this lethal process. Avoiding foods cooked at high temperature and
<br>
supplementing with 1000 mg a day of carnosine are the best ways of
<br>
mitigating the glycation process.

<br>
<p><p>What you should do
<br>
<p>Most Life Extension members follow a healthy lifestyle that helps prevent
<br>
glycation and chronic inflammation.
<br>
<p><p>Inflammatory cytokine production can be suppressed with the proper
<br>
supplementation of fish oil, DHEA, vitamin K and nettle leaf extract. If
<br>
blood tests reveal persistently high levels of inflammatory cytokines, then
<br>
400 mg twice a day of a low-cost drug called pentoxiphylline may bring
<br>
inflammatory cytokine levels down to safe ranges.
<br>
<p>What one eats plays a major role in chronic inflammatory processes.
<br>
Consuming low glycemic foods reduces the insulin surge that contributes to
<br>
chronic inflammatory processes. It is also important to avoid over
<br>
consumption of foods high in arachidonic acid (beef, egg yolk, dairy, etc.).
<br>
<p>We now know that eating too much over cooked food causes an increase in
<br>
inflammatory cytokines. Since most &quot;junk&quot; foods are cooked at extremely high
<br>
temperatures, it makes sense to avoid french fries, hamburgers, potato
<br>
chips, fried food and other snacks. These foods not only contain lots of
<br>
glycotoxins, but they also create other metabolic disorders that can induce
<br>
degenerative disease.
<br>
<p>Consuming at least 1000 mg a day of carnosine, and/or 300 mg of the European
<br>
drug aminoguanidine can inhibit pathological glycation reactions in the
<br>
body. Avoiding foods cooked at high temperature not only reduces
<br>
pathological glycation processes, but also prevents the formation of
<br>
numerous gene-mutating toxins that are known carcinogens.
<br>
<p>When food is cooked at high temperatures, deadly gene-mutating toxins are
<br>
created that increase human cancer risk. This warning has been communicated
<br>
to readers of this publication for many years. Now that overheated food is
<br>
associated with accelerated aging, health conscious individuals have an even
<br>
greater incentive to pay attention to their diet.
<br>
As a member of the Life Extension Foundation, you learn about documented
<br>
methods of reducing disease risk years before the general public.
<br>
<p>Those concerned that they are already suffering from the effects of a
<br>
chronic inflammatory disorder should turn to the next page to learn how they
<br>
can measure and suppress lethal pro-inflammatory cytokines.
