<a href="mailto:mwiik@messagenet.com?Subject=Re:%20[IRAQ]:%20Wheat%20from%20chaff">mwiik@messagenet.com</a> writes: Now on to the trotskyist references: Letâ€™s start 
<br>
with the neocons. As I discussed with someone the other day, the Neocons are 
<br>
far more attacking, far more militant, and thus far more obsessed with what 
<br>
everyone else is doing much more so than the Left ever was. And as Bush's 
<br>
regime proves, they are a much greater threat to liberty than those on the 
<br>
Left. [!!!-mwiik] I'll be documenting this in an upcoming column.
<br>
<p>Is this anti-Semitism although in a disguised form?  I see a fair sampling of 
<br>
conservative material and I have rarely heard anyone refer to themselves as 
<br>
neo-con.  I am certain I have never heard of Trotsky among those people.  I 
<br>
know the people pointed to by this writer are alleged to be Jewish.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However a normal person doesn't concern themselves with Jewishness (as 
<br>
a pejorative that is a nonstarter), the religious background of people, 
<br>
Trotsky is only an obscure historical reference important only to the 
<br>
socialist/communist movement and frankly the whole reference is to something 
<br>
unimportant, obscure and mostly unknowable.  With those qualities Mike can 
<br>
engineer up any set of statements he wishes without fear of being challenged. 
<br>
&nbsp;But what is his intent in doing so?
