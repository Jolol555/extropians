</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, since I don't recall this conversation, I must assume that it
<br>
took place after I had left Spike's for Seattle -- which is fine
<br>
though it is unfortunate since we didn't get a chance to interact head to
<br>
head on this.
<br>
<p>My general comment on &quot;allowing the sun to stay on&quot; is that I completely
<br>
agree -- it is a stupid waste of resources and suns should be turned off.
<br>
The problem is that it requires a huge amount of energy and a relatively
<br>
long time (millions of years at least) to turn it &quot;off&quot; (with some
<br>
possible exceptions that I cast shadows on in a reply to Spikes message
<br>
but I'm not willing to discuss in public until I can convince myself that
<br>
the numbers really work).
<br>
<p>So *yes* I strongly agree that the sun (or any star powering an advanced
<br>
civilization) should be turned off and the energy resources diverted to
<br>
a consumption process that maximizes energy production and utilization
<br>
efficiency.  (Now the best ways to do this involves some very complex
<br>
discussions.)  I believe I do have some mention in some of the MBrain
<br>
papers regarding the need to adapt a system architecture to precisely
<br>
*what* the system wants to &quot;think&quot; about.)  I believe that architectures
<br>
would vary from a dismantled star (consuming its energy in fusion reactors
<br>
very slowly), to a common solar system (using a stellar gravity well
<br>
to drive fusion processes), to an &quot;existentialist&quot; system where through
<br>
some means the energy production/consumption process is so accelerated
<br>
that neither the star nor the system (perhaps an MBrain around the star)
<br>
could survive.  The last alternative might be called destructive
<br>
computing (since the information it might generate would involve its
<br>
own self-destruction).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if you catch 100% of the Sun's power output,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Sun itself is generating many bits of entropy that are not being used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to write reversible computation outputs to memory, since the Sun is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing device.
</em><br>
<p>Yes of course.  And while I would clearly like to see the resources
<br>
go into reversible computational devices and perhaps the greater
<br>
production of extropic vs. entropic information -- I *do* not know
<br>
what the net-present-value of extropic vs. entropic information is.
<br>
<p>Classical economic theories would suggest that a penny of extropic
<br>
information now may be worth much more than a pound of entropic
<br>
information later.
<br>
<p>In case this isn't clear -- pls use the &quot;destructive computing&quot;
<br>
situation I have outlined above and detail &quot;approximately&quot;
<br>
how many star systems you would be willing to sacrifice to
<br>
generate a stable/productive/friendly AI within this star system?
<br>
<p>(The point of the question is to generate an evaluation of relative
<br>
levels of extropic and entropic activities in the universe and ways
<br>
they might be influenced and is not directed at positions of EY or
<br>
the SI in any way.  [I agree with many, though not all, positions
<br>
of EY and the SI as I currently understand them.])
<br>
<p>So my questions are more of an inquisitive nature and not a
<br>
disputive nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We must thus conclude that a sun plus an MBrain is massively inefficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a computer,
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely -- the question you have not resolved is whether an
<br>
MBrain in a million or a billion years can define a computer
<br>
architecture using &quot;physics which works&quot; which is significantly
<br>
faster/better/(whatever criteria you want to apply that we don't
<br>
currently know how to measure) such that 10 minutes of thinking
<br>
in a 2nd, or 3rd, or 4th Gen MBrain is equal to 1 million years
<br>
of thinking in a 1st Gen MBrain.  If that happens to be the case
<br>
then one should be burning up stars left and right to get to the
<br>
4th Gen Mbrain -- because it is going to really really really
<br>
kick butt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; since the total physical process generates many more bits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entropy than it performs useful irreversible computations.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, you have little disagreement from me on this point.  Generally
<br>
speaking we should *not* be using stars as primary energy sources
<br>
(though I don't think this is really proven yet but I'm willing
<br>
to accept it as a working hypothesis) and we *should* be using
<br>
reversible computations.
<br>
<p>The question I would ask is how one might know that the
<br>
total (extropic) information content of any web arena is
<br>
greater this saturday than next saturday.  If one cannot
<br>
know that then everthing from allocating ones time to
<br>
pricing tickets seems up for grabs.
