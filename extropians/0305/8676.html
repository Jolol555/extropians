Anders says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your version of libertarians/authoritarians seems to mirror
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Postrel's stasists and dynamists well too.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. It was partly her book that got me thinking about the kind of new
<br>
issues and divisions that are emerging in politics.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Real political views are far more complex than can be expressed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few dimensions; we are essentially projecting down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-dimensional space (that might even have a weird metric) into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2D or 3D. Different projections reveal different properties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make them separable, a good projection shows the most salient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences clearly (similar to a principal component
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decomposition).
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. Constructing a model of political beliefs is inherently
<br>
problematic, not least because the &quot;defining issues&quot; change over time. Can't
<br>
be avoided though if we are to make sense of political divisions. A slightly
<br>
different way of coming at this is to construct a model that sorts people
<br>
out not on the basis of beliefs but of what style of argument they find
<br>
persuasive, so making overt content less important than rhetoric. It's the
<br>
tropes used in argument that then become important.
