<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20(IRAQ)%20RE:%20Name%20calling%20vs.%20Ad%20Hominem">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes: I never said this either.  Are you sure you 
<br>
sure you don't have me confused with someone else?  You are attacking bizarre 
<br>
positions that I have not seen presented on this list, and certainly not 
<br>
presented by me.  Any evidence to the contrary would certainly be 
<br>
appreciated.
<br>
<p>No Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am referring in my entirety to the bizarre position you took in the 
<br>
off the wall post to which I referred.  Here is what you said: &quot;What are you 
<br>
talking about?  The US News media allowed their reporters to be embedded in 
<br>
the army and allowed their reports to be controlled, censored and dictated by 
<br>
the army.  As far as I can tell, the news media was totally controlled by the 
<br>
army's propaganda and disinformation service.  They reported exactly what 
<br>
they were told to report, whether it was true or not. I try to ignore 
<br>
political rants, because they are always biased, but this is so obviously 
<br>
180-degrees opposed to reality that I can't even imagine what you are talking 
<br>
about.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see how an informed person could possibly make that series of 
<br>
statements and expect to be considered serious and responsible.  I lampooned 
<br>
you to an extent and perhaps you feel I was excessive -- in that case I can 
<br>
only plead provocation.
