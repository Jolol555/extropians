<p><em>&gt; I don't know why humans have a tendency to reduce everything

</em><br>
<p>It was thinking about this in relation to some recent posts where the
<br>
word &quot;evil&quot; was being used. 
<br>
<p>Maybe us &quot;homo saps&quot; with our language and reasoning would have 
<br>
sometimes gotten ourselves into a sort of  evolutionary &quot;paralysis by
<br>
analysis&quot; if we'd always stopped to consider is this person or creature
<br>
threatening me actually genuinely &quot;evil&quot;? 
<br>
<p>Genuine &quot;evil&quot; seems, from the comfort of safety to be pretty rare, hard
<br>
to explain intellectually and perhaps even absurd. We are all, after all 
<br>
&quot;animals&quot; (in part) locked into contingencies that involve resource
<br>
competition at times. Adopting the &quot;beyond good and evil&quot; perspectives
<br>
might provide useful insights for solving problems sometimes but more 
<br>
often for most of us such a detached view could merely added more to
<br>
the chances of  ending up as food. &quot;Evil&quot; is simple and easy and clearly
<br>
to be avoided. Seeing predators (human or otherwise) as &quot;evil&quot; may 
<br>
historically haved save us enough time to stop us from becoming prey.
