</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and you forget that is how RR found out what was going on --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or was it later?  He was at a meeting or party and realised something was
</em><br>
awry.
<br>
<p>I didn't forget.  It was 1944 when he joined that he was told that some
<br>
communists were trying to infiltrate the organization.  Reagan instituted
<br>
loyalty oaths and secret blackball lists to try to keep communists from
<br>
joining the organization or being employed in Hollywood.    This is why I
<br>
chose Reagan as such a perfect example that not everybody associated with
<br>
that organization was a communist.
