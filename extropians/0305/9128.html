phrase
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;get over yourself&quot; comes to mind ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Er... leaving aside the question of why someone else's attitude should
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sealed rationalist, who walks out the sole survivor of a train crash that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; strange is going on.
</em><br>
<p>People are entitled to their attitudes - and I'm not angry at their
<br>
attitudes as long as those attitudes don't hurt anyone.  (But when zombie
<br>
god warriors fly planes into skyscrapers; when a mother in Texas stones 2
<br>
out of three of her sons to death on God's orders; when stem cell research -
<br>
and other kinds of scientific research - is held back so as not to offend
<br>
the sacred You-Know-Who ... well, all right, I can get a tad bent - but sad,
<br>
mostly).
<br>
<p>If you are a naive statistician, it requires no
<br>
<em>&gt; great bias toward self-importance - it is only natural - to look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoking wreckage and say to yourself:  &quot;What the heck?&quot;  I see no reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the same train of thought should not honestly occur to a 13-year-old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who finds himself graduating college.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly, I can understand why a 13-year-old would think that (most
<br>
teenagers are prone to narcissism, anyway - it's probably even an important
<br>
developmental step).  I was just saying that that's an arrogant statement
<br>
(and I still think it is, even though understandable as in the case of Greg
<br>
Smith).  Years ago Carl Sagan wrote an article (it's reprinted in one of his
<br>
books, I don't remember which one offhand) for Parade Magazine with the
<br>
title:  &quot;We Are Nothing Special.&quot;  He got it right.
