<p>To some extent this is the same method as in scenario planning - find 
<br>
the &quot;driving forces&quot;, and look at the different combinations. 
<br>
<p>However, I think one could usefully (for our discussions) add a
<br>
third axis: technological coercion. Some people want to determine
<br>
what and how technology is used and developed, others want to leave
<br>
this free and legislate when actual problems develop. So there is
<br>
an issue of technological freedom, or freedom to tinker. 
<br>
<p>So we get the following cube (I won't try to ascii it), with + 
<br>
representing freedom:
<br>
<p>Tech   Social  Economic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-      -       -      Anti tech authoritarians (reactionaries)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-      -       +      Anti tech conservatives (Kass, Fukyama)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-      +       -      Anti tech liberals (Rifkin)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-      +       +      Anti tech libertarians (small is good?)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+      -       -      Pro tech authoritarians (high tech fascism, prometheans)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+      -       +      Pro tech conservatives (good for business)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+      +       -      Pro tech liberals (left transhumanism?)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;+      +       +      Pro tech libertarian (&quot;classical&quot; extropianism)
<br>
<p>Some of these combinations are less common than others. People
<br>
accepting social and economic freedom but not technological 
<br>
freedom seem to be rare, but I think I have encountered a few. 
<br>
Most seem to want a free &quot;small is good&quot; society with no roaring 
<br>
singularities. 
<br>
<p>The content provider fraction is strongly against technological 
<br>
freedom (at least for others) but does not have much political 
<br>
ideology; I would guess they are pro economic freedom (at least 
<br>
for them), so they would be somewhere in the 
<br>
authoritarian-conservative-centrist region.
