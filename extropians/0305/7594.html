<p>Thanks
<br>
<p>I cut out the top part of your reply, but I would like to point out that 
<br>
right at the beginning of the Lipid Hypothesis section, it makes clear 
<br>
that the hypothesis is regarding a specific kind of fat- saturated fat. 
<br>
You seem in some of your comments below to not understand this/complain 
<br>
that they aren't providing evidence regarding separate kinds of fats. 
<br>
Clearly the author of the paper did not set out to attack total fat 
<br>
consumption, but rather certain kinds of fats and the converse idea that 
<br>
saturated fat is to blame for many diseases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The discussion of Pritikin doesn't really give any facts or evidence against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  Pritikin was originally just low fat, and then later added vegetable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oils, so it contained unsaturated fats but not saturated fats.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation why this diet was bad.
</em><br>
<p>Actually there is a reference (#1) that claims various health issues 
<br>
caused by the very low fat diet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The paper implies that the addition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetable oils proved the low fat diet wrong, but instead it merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clarified that saturated fats are bad and unsaturated fats are good.  No
</em><br>
<p>This is clearly your own viewpoint, correct? I think the point being 
<br>
made is simply that he was forced to add some kind of fat. We can agree 
<br>
on that I think, and that is all the author of this paper is attempting 
<br>
to show at this point in the paper. The fact that the Dr. (who already 
<br>
had made one poor decision on behalf of his patients- the idea of the 
<br>
extremely low fat diet) deciding to make the added fats unsaturated ones 
<br>
does not prove that saturated fats are bad. It may be just another bad 
<br>
decision he made based on his dogma.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The section on &quot;evidence&quot; gives a history of the rise of heart disease, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't really given any evidence of what causes it.  It claims that butter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption reduced during this time, but doesn't really address the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question whether fat consumption when up or down.  It assumes total fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption went down in the American diet proportional with butter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption, and that the modern American diet is less fatty than 60 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous.  This is both unproven and unlikely.  This is not very strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for the decline of fat in the diet, nor is there any evidence of a
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the assumptions you refer to... and clearly to me it is not 
<br>
even attempting to lump all fats together or show overall fat 
<br>
consumption went up or down. What it seems to plainly state is that over 
<br>
that period of time, animal/saturated fat declined as a percentage of 
<br>
dietary intake, while vegetable oils and sugar etc. increased. Do you 
<br>
really dispute this? I think there is clear historical evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; cause and effect in any case.  Furthermore, most of the studies being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;refuted&quot; in this article are from the 1950's.
</em><br>
<p>This is because of the central role a lot of this research had on the 
<br>
formation of the lipid hypothesis. Once the hypothesis formed and gained 
<br>
traction, 99% of the research after that seems to be directed at 
<br>
attempting to prove it, and any results that don't match up get either 
<br>
put under the rug or sometimes blatantly mis-characterized.
<br>
<p>It is hard to provide direct evidence to prove an anti-hypothesis (i.e. 
<br>
that cholesterol/saturated fat does not cause heart disease) when no one 
<br>
has even really done many studies to get data for that. What you are 
<br>
left with is what you see here... attempting to go back to supposedly 
<br>
pro-hypothesis work and show flaws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The representation of the Framingham Heart Study does not match what I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Framingham Heart Study webpage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/</a>&gt;.  The study did not divide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people into high-fat and low-fat groups, it had a single large group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  It did not focus primarily on diet or fat, but measured all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different factors in a person's life.  High fat versus low fat is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned in the list of study findings at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/timeline.htm">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/timeline.htm</a>&gt;.  Cigarette
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoking, serum cholesterol, physical activity, blood pressure, menopause,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychosocial factors, enlarged ventricles, and other factors are reported,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I don't see anything about diet.  This was not primarily a diet study,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nor did it compare high-fat with low-fat groups.  I don't see how this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relates to the &quot;lipid hypothesis&quot;, how it was supposedly refuted in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article, and what difference it would make if it were.
</em><br>
<p>Harvey the quote provided in the article is directly from the director 
<br>
of the study himself in 1992. I don't think it is disputable unless it 
<br>
is somehow out of context.
<br>
<p>On their research milestones page, they claim &quot;Major report issued on 
<br>
relationship of diet and heart disease&quot;. Clearly they have studied it.
<br>
<p>As to how it relates to the hypothesis, the study clearly claims to be 
<br>
designed to find the causes of CVD. Many people use it as &quot;evidence&quot;:
<br>
<p>&quot;Started over a half century ago, the Framingham Heart Study has 
<br>
provided much of what science knows today about the risks associated 
<br>
with heart disease. Today, the survey also uses high-tech imaging 
<br>
procedures such as MRI to obtain a non-invasive look at the heart and 
<br>
blood vessels. In the segment &quot;How's Your Heart?&quot;, you saw how this 
<br>
technique can uncover the buildup of deadly plaque within the aorta. One 
<br>
of the primary causes of heart disease is a high-fat diet. How well do 
<br>
you eat? Do your meals follow the guidelines for healthy diets suggested 
<br>
by the American Heart Association? There's one way to find out.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/saf/1104/teaching/teaching3.htm">http://www.pbs.org/saf/1104/teaching/teaching3.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Clearly the _interpretations_ of the results of this study are very 
<br>
important to shaping many beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't really evaluate most of the studies cited, because it doesn't give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any details about them or their methodology.  However, all the studies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones that were supposed to prove the low-fat hypothesis and failed to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There were no studies that actually showed that saturated fats were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required.  This seems scant evidence that all studies showing unsaturated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fat to be superior to saturated fats were all flawed.  It also provides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely no evidence that saturated fats are required in the diet.
</em><br>
<p>The goal in this section of the paper is to attack the hypothesis. There 
<br>
are no studies regarding potentially positive effects of saturated fats, 
<br>
because as I pointed out above there really is very little scientific 
<br>
work that has been done in this area since the &quot;sat fats bad&quot; meme took 
<br>
off in the 50s and beyond.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The dates of these studies also bothers me.  They were 1983, 1983, 1982,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1983, 1984, 1985.  We no a lot more about fats today than we did 20 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago.  These studies may have been flawed since they reduced all fats and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't distinguish between different types.  But a lack of proof from
</em><br>
<p>According to reference #5, that study specified between sat fats and 
<br>
unsaturated oils.
<br>
<p>Ref #7 says that a low sat fat was used... the effects of sat fat were 
<br>
not even tested.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; studies 20 years ago does not refute modern studies performed today.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think modern studies clearly do show some fats to be better or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different than other fats.  A lack of proof of this fact from 20 years ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not conclusive or convincing
</em><br>
<p>Again keep in mind the purpose of this article. It is attempting to 
<br>
attack the hypothesis, and it is using the &quot;pillars of support&quot; that 
<br>
supposedly are the superstrong scientific evidence proving the 
<br>
hypothesis. What this article is _not_ doing is attempting to thoroughly 
<br>
debunk all known anti-sat-fat studies. If you have some superstrong 
<br>
evidence then post it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The studies that refute the lipid hypothesis were similarly old and flawed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They measured &quot;cholesterol&quot; without distinguishing between good (HDL)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol and bad (LDL) cholesterol.  Cholesterol is not a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictor of heart attack anyway.  Even if these studies are flawed, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't address the question of saturated fats in the diet.  All of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studies discussed by this article seem to be a little off base.  None of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them directly study saturated fat versus unsaturated fat.  These studies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also &quot;failed&quot; to prove cholesterol caused heart attacks, or that dietary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol causes serum cholesterol.  But these don't directly address the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of whether dietary saturated fats are required or not.
</em><br>
<p>First off remember that cholesterol and its purported effects are part 
<br>
of the hypothesis being attacked. So it must also take some hits. But I 
<br>
will point out:
<br>
<p>ref #11 says that a single change between eating butter and margarine 
<br>
made a big difference in CVD risk- study from 1991.
<br>
<p>ref #12 points out that sat fats and cholesterol are essential for 
<br>
children/growing brains. And ref #13 from 1994 links lowfat diets for 
<br>
children with &quot;failure to thrive&quot;.
<br>
<p>ref #14 points out in a study of Jews living in different environments 
<br>
that one of the major differences was between animal fats and vegetable 
<br>
oils.
<br>
<p>then multiple studies and facts pointing out many examples of people who 
<br>
eat very high saturated fat diets and yet have no heart disease (or at 
<br>
least nothing like how much people on Western diets have). This also I 
<br>
believe is a good attack on the hypothesis... if sat fat causes health 
<br>
problems, these people should all have many problems!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although none of the studies seemed to distinguish between different types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fats,
</em><br>
<p>While I do not have the studies to look at, clearly some of them as I 
<br>
mention above are focusing on different kinds of fats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problems with too much polyunsaturated oils seem like they would apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any oil.  Excessive consumption of these fats causes obesity-related
</em><br>
<p>Go back up and read in the section about short-chain FAs.. ref #27 from 
<br>
1998 points out that these are apparently less likely to make you gain 
<br>
weight. Of course all of these are saturated fats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; symptoms such as cancer, heart disease, immune system depression, liver
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage, etc.  It also discusses how oils can become oxidized and oxidized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oils are bad for you.  However, it does not show that other oils don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exact same problems.  The paper then discusses the imbalance of too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omega-6 and too little omega-3, but fails to show how saturated fats would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help this balance.
</em><br>
<p>ref #30 purports to say polunsaturated fats should only be 4% of 
<br>
calories. I don't know what this is based on though.. apparently paleo 
<br>
diet theory?
<br>
<p>ref #32 purports to say polyunsatured fat intake was the one linked to 
<br>
heart disease and cancer.
<br>
<p>In the previous section discussing the types of fats, it is stated that 
<br>
saturated fats are more chemically stable and less likely to become 
<br>
oxidized when heated or over time. Do you disagree?
<br>
<p>Clearly by dramatically reducing use of vegetable oils high in O-6, we 
<br>
can significantly help reduce the extreme overabundance of O-6 in 
<br>
Western diets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The section that actually gets into the benefits of saturated fats is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short compared to the other rambling rants that don't get to the point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This section seems to only describe the benefits of saturated fatty acids in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the body.  Most of these uses inside the body provide no clue as to whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saturated fat needs to be incorporated in the diet, or if the body is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incapable of manufacturing its own saturated fat.  The second point does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assert that 50% of dietary fat should be saturated, but it is unclear why.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They study cited is about the effects of vitamin E on bone health, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details about why this dietary need is given.  Besides this minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; references, all of the points are about the need for saturated fat in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tissues, which is not disputed.  Even vegetarian animals such as cows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce a lot of saturated fat.  This paper certainly provides no evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that humans have lost the ability to produce their own saturated fat like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other animals such that it needs to be incorporated into the diet.
</em><br>
<p>It does also claim that O-3 is better retained when diet is rich in 
<br>
saturated fats (#42). Also, the title of the #41 study sounds like it is 
<br>
talking about dietary sat fat, but it's hard to tell.
<br>
<p>Although the paper does mention one specific case of clear changes in 
<br>
human cells (incorporating polyunsaturated fats into cell walls and then 
<br>
causing cholesterol to be incorporated as a reinforcing agent) when fed 
<br>
too much polyunsaturated fat, the main point again of the paper is not 
<br>
so much to argue that saturated fats are perfect, but rather that what 
<br>
we have replaced them with in our diets is causing us many problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The section on cholesterol is similar.  It shows all the vital roles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol plays internally.  it does not show that cholesterol is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required nutrient which cannot be created by our bodies.
</em><br>
<p>You must have missed ref #49.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In summary:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. This paper refutes a &quot;low-fat&quot; diet without distinguishing between good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and bad fats.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. Clearly the paper attempts to point out problems with things 
<br>
like  polyunsaturated vegetable oils. In fact it identifies them along 
<br>
with hydrogentated fats as a likely cause of heart disease and cancer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. This paper uses mostly very old references and few modern sources.
</em><br>
<p>The anti-saturated fat dogma is also based on similar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. This paper shows a few studies that failed to prove high fat was bad, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acted like this was evidence for the reverse.
</em><br>
<p>I would say it showed more than a few, and several were very high 
<br>
profile studies. It also provided specific examples of dangers of 
<br>
low-fat diets. What I got out of this paper was not so much that I am 
<br>
convinced I should eat a lot of saturated fat, but that at least the 
<br>
case against it and cholesterol does not seem very solid.
<br>
<p>And I DO think it is relevant to keep in mind who has funded many of 
<br>
these anti-animal foods studies, and who also has spent quite a lot of 
<br>
money lobbying various government organizations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4. This paper showed no studies that high fat was good.
</em><br>
<p>I think there were a few things in there, but yes I wish there were more 
<br>
studies performed on this subject, especially high saturated fat. It 
<br>
seems severely underfunded compared to the massive amounts of effort 
<br>
pointed at trying to find problems with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5. This paper showed saturated fats were required internally, and then just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed that they must be required in the diet if they are found in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body.
</em><br>
<p>You're right it did a poor job at this. It did present plenty of 
<br>
anecdotal and other evidence though that many of the fats we have 
<br>
replaced it with are not doing us any good, and also that in some cases 
<br>
the body uses them in not necessarily good ways rather than reforming 
<br>
them into saturated fats. And it mentioned in passing that saturated 
<br>
fats in the diet may help our immune system in various ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7. This paper showed bad effects of too much or oxidized unsaturated fats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but failed to show that saturated fats did not suffer from these same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative effects.
</em><br>
<p>It clearly stated they are less likely to become oxidized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 8. The paper showed no evidence of good effects from eating saturated fats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no comparison studies that measured saturated fat in the diet at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9. The section on benefits of saturated fat only addressed fatty acids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10. The paper frequently got off on unrelated tangents, like proving dietary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol might not cause cholesterol, or meat contains more B-vitamins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than vegetables, all of which are orthogonal to the discussion of saturated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fats.
</em><br>
<p>The paper is pushing animal fats and animal-derived fats since these 
<br>
were the major sources of saturated fats that were originally attacked 
<br>
back in the 50s or whenever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 11. The paper cited a decline in butter use and assumed that this indicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a decline in total fat intake.
</em><br>
<p>Not by my reading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 12. The paper had a lot of logical fallacies.  It combined dissimilar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categories of items and used evidence about one to apply to another.  It had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sections labeled with one topic which then proceeded to discuss a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.  It took a lack of evidence of one theory to indicate support for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another.  It made unsupported assertions laced with references supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor unrelated points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was little to refute in this paper.  Most of its logic was flawed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its evidence orthogonal to what it was presenting.  It mostly boiled down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the argument that its theory hasn't been proven wrong and therefore must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right.  I saw only a few minor implied statements that eating saturated fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At best, this paper might be a hold-over from an earlier period when all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fats were lumped together and all cholesterol was thought to be bad.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper does a poor job of asserting the correct position that not all fats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are bad and not all cholesterol is bad.  It does not address diet as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal chemistry.  It also appears to me that the chemistry section
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing different types of fats was tacked on to an earlier paper that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't make this distinction.  Although all the right definitions were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included in one section, these distinctions were ignored in the discussion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence and persuasive sections.  By mixing good fats with bad fats, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good cholesterol with bad cholesterol, this paper neither supports nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refutes the question of whether &quot;fats&quot; are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I will give you some of that. To me, it simply is an interesting puff 
<br>
piece regarding some potentially health-increasing hypotheses. It has 
<br>
enough points to get me to consider the idea that the saturated fat 
<br>
dogma may be incorrect, but it certainly doesn't prove anything for certain.
