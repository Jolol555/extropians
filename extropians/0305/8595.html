<p>Your version of libertarians/authoritarians seems to mirror

Postrel's stasists and dynamists well too. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anders' model is better because by separating out the attitude to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise pose problems such as fascists.
</em><br>
<p>Real political views are far more complex than can be expressed in 
<br>
a few dimensions; we are essentially projecting down a 
<br>
high-dimensional space (that might even have a weird metric) into 
<br>
2D or 3D. Different projections reveal different properties and 
<br>
make them separable, a good projection shows the most salient 
<br>
differences clearly (similar to a principal component 
<br>
decomposition).

<em>&gt; Anders, this is a really good explaination, and something which

<em>&gt; together in flyer form for the Escape to New Hampshire conference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next month? Adding a technology axis maps us into the liberty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere really well.
</em><br>
<p>I'll see if I can make a flyer or webpage based on it, with some 
<br>
commentary. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we need a new Worlds Shortest  Political Quiz?
</em><br>
<p>Natasha:
<br>
<em>&gt; It's David Nolan's &quot;Worlds Smallest Political Quiz&quot; (1969).  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't work well because its 10 questions require quantifying by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who take the test.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I saw that the original quiz contained issues that have since
<br>
then changed party valence, like abortion and gun control. And even
<br>
then, judging attitudes is always messy. I think the benefit of the
<br>
quiz is that it shows the difference between different approaches,
<br>
and that is often a good wake up call for people. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At ExI, we are working on a &quot;Worlds Smallest Futurist Quiz, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm working on a version for my talk at the TransVision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conference.  For this, I was planning on solicitating Ander's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keen mind :-)
</em><br>
<p>I would be delighted! After all, there are different kinds of
<br>
futures and futurists too. However, that sounds somewhat different
<br>
from the inherently political quiz I suggested in this thread. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure just how to does this for a futurists' quiz, but at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least I've got the first 2 questions.  The night before last, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mother, Max and I tossed around a few ideas and this was provoking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because of the differences between an 85 year old and baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt;boomers.  We focused on biotechnological questions and my mother
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proved to be extropic in her thinking here.  But not everywhere! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that to design a balanced quiz, it would require either a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person who is very sharp or a team of people from diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;backgrounds to test the questions. 
</em><br>
<p>I think we need to think about what the quiz should reveal or be 
<br>
used for. One approach is to show the assumptions about the 
<br>
speed/size of future changes and one's valence to it (e.g. Bill Joy 
<br>
is close to our idea of the size and speed, but not that it is a 
<br>
good thing, while many conservative thinkers are negative but do 
<br>
not believe any real change is on the horizon). Another approach is 
<br>
to look at how radical changes are conceivable within different 
<br>
areas, and how well these can be integrated into coherent world 
<br>
models of the future. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm just a beginner with this sort of thing, so I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough experience to know right now. With a futurist quiz, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;design issue would be to help people rate their own ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accept change and to adjust to change. Its pretty obvious that not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone is futurist thinking in all areas. Politics and religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are probably the most backward areas for futurism.
</em><br>
<p>This seems like a third approach: to see how people react to change 
<br>
individually rather than how they perceive it. One could factor it 
<br>
along how much change people expect and how they expect to cope 
<br>
with it, which would likely reveal the distinction between 
<br>
optimists/pessimists and future-aimed and past-aimed people. 
<br>
<p><p>In many ways I think quizes are less revealing than the chart 
<br>
itself.
