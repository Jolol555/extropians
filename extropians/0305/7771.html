</em><br>
<p>Historically one of the most important ways that human rights spread was
<br>
for states not respecting human rights to be militarily defeated by states
<br>
that did. The defeated states adopted human rights either because they
<br>
were conquered and taken over, or as a side effect of economic and
<br>
political reforms that allowed them to better defend themselves in the
<br>
future. There's a great book about the historical interactions between
<br>
war, military strategy, international law, and constitutional law. It's
<br>
titled The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History by
<br>
Philip Bobbitt. I recommend this book highly and it is very relevant to
<br>
the current discussion.
<br>
<p>What makes the UN's version of human rights farcical is not the lack of
<br>
world peace and security but the notion that human rights can be achieved
<br>
through an organization based on the principle of &quot;one government, one
<br>
vote&quot; with no qualification for what constitutes a legitimate government. 
<br>
What would prevent Libya from heading the human rights commission even if 
<br>
we had world peace today?
<br>
<p>Roosevelt clearly made a big mistake with the U.N. The security council
<br>
represents the alliance that defeated Germany and Japan in WW2, and the
<br>
general assembly allows any government to have a vote. But what made him
<br>
think that the alliance could be permanent? Or that the general assembly
<br>
wouldn't be taken over by a coalition of repressive and corrupt
<br>
governments? I'd really like to know what he was thinking at the time so 
<br>
we can avoid making the same mistakes again.
<br>
<p>Of course one way to avoid those mistakes is to simply not have a U.N. 3.
<br>
For the forseeable future, the United States seems capable of achieving
<br>
what it wants through ad hoc &quot;coalitions of the willing&quot;. What does it 
<br>
have to gain from creating a U.N. 3?
<br>
<p>Brett seems to favor a U.N. not for itself, but as a step to something
<br>
better in the future. But what? Where do you want this &quot;bootstrap process&quot;
<br>
to take us?
