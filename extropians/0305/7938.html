</em><br>
<p>Greg, I strongly object that this statement is extremely unbalanced.
<br>
Crops which have had the BT gene added actually require *less* pesticide
<br>
administration than normal crops.  With respect to herbicides, for
<br>
example adding enzymes to crops, e.g. soybeans, that allow them to
<br>
be tolerant of herbicides such as round-up -- humans do not have
<br>
the enzymes that the plants have that the herbicides inhibit.  So
<br>
there is no toxic effect of increased levels of increased herbicide
<br>
(glyphosate) on humans.
<br>
<p>You are spouting the (green) party line and on this list that isn't
<br>
going to get you far unless you back it up with some really hard science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That and using extremely dangerous diseases for markers.
</em><br>
<p>Citations *please*?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What a mess... If GM had been more responsible or regulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (waves down indignation), organic food certification probably wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had to exclude GM foods.
</em><br>
<p>Organic food certification is simply a way to allow small-farm and/or
<br>
government subsidized farms (in Europe) farmers to compete against large
<br>
farms that have mass production advantages.  Its health benefits
<br>
are marginal if any.
<br>
<p>For example -- go find some statistics that state that &quot;organic&quot; peanuts
<br>
have less aflatoxin than &quot;non-organic&quot; peanuts.  Aflatoxin is a known
<br>
carcinogen produced by fungi that grow on peanuts -- it is known to cause
<br>
mutations in the p53 gene that lead to cancer.  The amount one ingests
<br>
is regulated by food safety regulations -- but clearly less would be better.
<br>
The amount one ingests has little or nothing to do with how the peanuts
<br>
are grown and a lot to do with how they are stored.
<br>
<p>That isn't a GM/organic debate -- its a food processing (cost) debate.
<br>
<p>Robert
