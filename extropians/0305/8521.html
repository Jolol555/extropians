<br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying that in a heavily Democrat County
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every county nevertheless elected a county sheriff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was Republican?
</em><br>
<p>No, not every county sheriff is a republican.  That is why I said &quot;sheriffs
<br>
and republicans.&quot;  However, our governor is a republican and so was the
<br>
supervisor of elections.  They set up many of the election procedures and
<br>
policing guidelines.  The locals police forces did not refuse to follow
<br>
orders from Tallahassee.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to individual policemen acting this way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they are Republican those policemen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to answer to their Sergeants,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lieutenants, etc., and in addition are scrutinized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by poll watchers &amp; election judges half of which
</em><br>
are Democrats.
<br>
<p>They did.  There were quite a few arrests and lawsuits over various issues
<br>
all over the state.  But all of this was after the fact, and did not restore
<br>
the votes to those illegally turned away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        There were five to seven cases in court, not counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their Supreme Court, all in front of judges that were known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be Democrat.  Yet the Republicans won every court case.
</em><br>
<p>Here are five to seven counter-examples where Republicans lost their court
<br>
cases:
<br>
<p>In the case of Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, the judge refused
<br>
to order the inclusion of undated unpostmarked ballots from overseas
<br>
military personnel as Bush had requested.
<br>
<p>In the case of Gore vs. Harris, the Florida Supreme court overturned the
<br>
lower court.  Gore won the right to reject the certified votes provided by
<br>
Katherine Harris and the right to resume the manual recount of the votes.
<br>
<p>In the case of Bush v. Bay County Canvassing Board et al, the judge
<br>
expressed so much skepticism toward the Republican arguments that they
<br>
voluntarily withdrew the case.
<br>
<p>In the case of Palm Beach County Canvassing Board v. Harris, the court
<br>
barred Harris from certifying the results and ruled that hand recounts had
<br>
to be performed under Florida election law.
<br>
<p>In the case of Harris v. Circuit Judges of the 11th, 15th &amp; 17th Judicial
<br>
Circuits of Florida, the judges refused the request to stop the manual
<br>
recounts.  They also refused the request to consolidate all the election
<br>
lawsuits into a single suit.
<br>
<p>In the case of Florida Democratic Party v. Palm Beach Canvassing Board, the
<br>
judge rejected the request to summarily discard ballots with so-called
<br>
dimpled chads.
