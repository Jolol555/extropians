<p>I wonder how obvious agriculture really is. Diamond makes a good
<br>
case that it is not likely to start outside certain very special
<br>
regions due to the presence of useful species (suggesting that had
<br>
the climate or geography been a bit different we might still be
<br>
stuck in the caves), and even there it took plenty of time to
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>Let's imagine a forest dwelling HG tribe that have invented
<br>
writing; they use specially prepared banana leaves and a plant
<br>
based ink. What use is this writing? HG tribes are small and
<br>
everybody is more or less in constant touch, so there is no need
<br>
for internal memos. The shaman might benefit by noting down the
<br>
sacred stories to give to his successor, but is that benefit
<br>
larger than the effort to prepare the leaves and ink? And would
<br>
the tribe benefit much from it in competition with other tribes?
<br>
It does not seem like a cruicial thing in this kind of simple
<br>
society. A genius could invent mathematics, but without
<br>
significant trade, cattle herds or other applications it would
<br>
just be a neat pastime easily forgotten the next lean time. 
<br>
<p>To me it seems that there are certain technologies that are
<br>
possible to invent (and may actually be invented from time to
<br>
time) but given the current socioecological situation they will
<br>
not be selected for (writing in a HG society, steam engines in
<br>
classical times). Other technologies have strong selection effects
<br>
(using flint for tools, agriculture) and will open up new
<br>
possibilities. These possibilities are sometimes taken, and create
<br>
new socioecological situations where technologies that previously
<br>
were of little use become far more useful.
