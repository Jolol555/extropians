</em><br>
<p>One of the problems I have with Michael Huemer's points---although
<br>
agreeing that this paper is very good and on the whole makes
<br>
valuable points---is when he writes
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one psychological study, subjects were exposed to evidence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning the deterrent effect of capital punishment.  One
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;study had concluded that capital punishment has a deterrent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect; another had concluded that it does not. All experimental
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subjects were provided with summaries of both studies, and then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asked to assess which conclusion the evidence they had just
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked at most supported, overall. The result was that those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who initially supported capital punishment claimed that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence they’d been shown, overall, supported that capital
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;punishment has a deterrent effect. Those who initially opposed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capital punishment thought, instead, that this same evidence,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overall, supported that capital punishment had no deterrent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect.  In each case, partisans came up with reasons (or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rationalizations) for why the study whose conclusion they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed with was methodologically superior to the other study.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This points up one reason why people tend to become polarized
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(sc., to adopt very strong beliefs on a particular side) about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political issues: we tend to evaluate mixed evidence as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supporting whichever belief we already incline towards—--
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereupon we increase our degree of belief.
<br>
<p>I agree that everything he has said here is true; I simply don't
<br>
think that evolution erred to make us this way.  But first of all,
<br>
a point about PCR (Pat-Critical Rationalism).
<br>
<p>It must be held in mind that mixed evidence DOES NOT knock down a
<br>
belief!  Mixed evidence does not refute anything, and a conjecture
<br>
subjected to only &quot;mixed evidence&quot; survives the criticism, perhaps
<br>
unscathed.  So therefore it is in the nature of how our learning
<br>
take place---through conjecture and refutation---that this tendency
<br>
within us arises.  And so far as we know (considering the absence
<br>
of other beings who think a lot different from us), this is a good
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>He also wrote about the very same subject,
<br>
<p><p>b.  Selective attention and energy:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us spend more time thinking about arguments supporting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our beliefs than we spend thinking about arguments supporting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative beliefs.  A natural result is that the arguments
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supporting our beliefs have more psychological impact on us,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we are less likely to be aware of reasons for doubting our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beliefs.  I think that most of us, when we hear an argument for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a conclusion we disbelieve, immediately set about finding &quot;what’s
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong with the argument&quot;.  But when we hear an argument for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion we believe, we are much more likely to accept the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argument at face value, thereby further solidifying our belief,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than to look for things that might be wrong with it.
<br>
<p>Well, for some reason this strikes me as only natural.  Suppose
<br>
that you were assessing the impact of a flock of birds in the
<br>
distance; it's a little bit disconfirming of your belief that
<br>
the best hunting ground lies in the other direction.  This ought
<br>
to give you a little pause, and to perhaps cause a bit of
<br>
re-thinking---but you'll probably just try to fit it in with
<br>
your pre-existing beliefs.  Sounds perfectly fine to me.  But
<br>
suppose that you see the flock in the direction which you
<br>
already to believe to lie the best hunting; as he says, you'll
<br>
experience some reinforcing gratification.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is illustrated by the capital punishment study mentioned
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above (section 5, d): subjects scrutinized the study whose
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusion they disagreed with closely, seeking methodological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flaws, but accepted at face value the study with whose conclusion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they agreed. Almost all studies have some sort of epistemological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imperfections, so this technique almost always enables one to hold
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the factual beliefs about society that one wants.
<br>
<p>Well, as the skeptics say, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary
<br>
evidence!  If someone presents me with what appears to be an airtight
<br>
argument that people are not affected by incentives, and that (say)
<br>
redistribution of income won't affect total production, then I'm going
<br>
to apply much stronger filters to that argument than I would its simple
<br>
converse.  This too is only natural, isn't it?
<br>
<p>Finally, along these lines, a good task for all those who find our
<br>
methods of reasoning---including the very well-documented ways in
<br>
which we err on probability problems (see the studies by Kahneman,
<br>
Slovic, and Tversky)---is to explain how it is that we evolved to
<br>
be predictably less than perfect reasoners, even given more than
<br>
ample enough time to have had it corrected.
