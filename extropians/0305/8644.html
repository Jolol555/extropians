</em><br>
<p>Actually, I've heard about every single method you
<br>
listed.  And I've built systems that guard against
<br>
'em.
<br>
(CGI scripts that *don't* validate input?  My sysadmin
<br>
would have my job if I let one of those onto our
<br>
system, regardless of whether or not anyone's
<br>
exploited
<br>
it yet.  And he checks.)
<br>
<p>I will grant, those vulnerabilities exist in far more
<br>
places than most people realize.  The problem is, the
<br>
vulnerabilities almost always turn up in trivial
<br>
systems: *unclassified* military systems (like a
<br>
public
<br>
Web server), *small* ecommerce systems (that haven't
<br>
processed more than a few $millions yet, and often
<br>
tend
<br>
to get exploited and their owners sued out of
<br>
existence before they grow large if their owners don't
<br>
take security seriously), et cetera and so forth. 
<br>
This
<br>
is a function of the fact that, if it's on the public
<br>
'Net, it will be found and attacked eventually.  Those
<br>
systems that survive are the ones that were and remain
<br>
secure.  Natural selection in action.  (That there are
<br>
still vulnerabilites stems in part from the perceived
<br>
lack of benefit for paying for proper security, among
<br>
the corporate managers who would have to budget for
<br>
it.)
<br>
<p>To counter the meme that all systems are vulnerable,
<br>
how about this test: there is an Excel spreadsheet on
<br>
the desktop of the Windows computer I am typing this
<br>
email at.  Try to break in and tell me what the
<br>
spreadsheet describes before Monday, 5/26/2003,
<br>
without
<br>
gaining physical access to the machine.  Of course I
<br>
have a firewall and so on; the real kicker is that I
<br>
intend to leave my computer powered down this weekend
<br>
while I attend some real world functions.
<br>
<p>Unfair?  No, that's reality: anything that truly
<br>
matters tends to be secure.  If you want a &quot;fair&quot;
<br>
challenge, go ahead and deface one of my Web sites
<br>
(<a href="http://www.wingedcat.org/">http://www.wingedcat.org/</a>)...and note how little that
<br>
really affects me.  This is about the extent of the
<br>
damage that most cyberattacks really do.  (Granted,
<br>
some - like those that steal CC numbers - actually do
<br>
a
<br>
modest amount of financial damage.  But not that
<br>
much.)
<br>
<p>To date, of the systems that I have personally
<br>
secured,
<br>
only one is known to have been compromised - by
<br>
myself,
<br>
at the request of those I built the system for when
<br>
they lost the admin password.  (Fortunately, they only
<br>
wanted network security, not physical security, and I
<br>
had physical access when recovering the password.)
