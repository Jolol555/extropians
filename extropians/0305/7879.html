<p>If you are trying to be rational, it's something of a danger sign if
<br>
your opinions are unchanged by facts.  It could be an indication that
<br>
your beliefs are being controlled by an ideology.  In order to protect
<br>
themselves and remain stable, ideologies control your perceptions and
<br>
make it hard to change your mind about things.
<br>
<p>Given all the surprises and unexpected developments of the circumstances
<br>
surrounding the Iraq war, I think it would be quite unusual for a rational
<br>
person to be able to look back and say, if I knew then what I know now,
<br>
my degree of support for the war would be unchanged.  I think the odds
<br>
are that most rational people would find that their opinions had changed
<br>
to at least some degree.
<br>
<p>The only exceptions would be (A) if everything happened exactly as they
<br>
predicted; or (B) if the good and bad news basically cancelled each
<br>
other out, as John Clark says explicitly in his case.
<br>
<p>(A) seems unlikely - if anyone did predict the details, they would
<br>
certainly deserve a great deal of credit.  And even (B) is a rather
<br>
suspicious coincidence.  Even with an intelligent person, an ideology
<br>
can take hold and fool you into believing that you are weighing all the
<br>
evidence, and that the result comes out the same as before.
<br>
<p>However, I don't think this is the situation in John Clark's case, because
<br>
most ideologies would not accept a 50-50 level of support for a cause.
<br>
Grounds for suspicion only arise if your before-and-after position was
<br>
the one supported by your ideology.
<br>
<p>In order to avoid having the list fall back into the endless, pointless,
<br>
vicious ideological debate about the pros and cons of the war, I would
<br>
encourage people to emphasize the *change* in their position, rather than
<br>
how stable their views have been.  Even if you still support or oppose the
<br>
action, has your degree of support changed?  Embrace your flexibility!
<br>
There is no shame in changing your mind.  Indeed, I continue to believe
<br>
that proudly announcing that your position hasn't been swayed by the facts
<br>
is one of the worst signs of closed-mindedness and irrational thinking.
<br>
