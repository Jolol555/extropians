</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; this perfect understanding is almost never the case.
</em><br>
<p>While Robin says that they would agree &quot;immediately&quot;, his result describes
<br>
a process where the agents would exchange information about their beliefs,
<br>
update their beliefs based on what they hear, and exchange information
<br>
about the updated beliefs.  They do come to agreement pretty soon, and the
<br>
only information that has to be exchanged is the other person's opinion.
<br>
I think that's what he means by &quot;immediately&quot;.
<br>
<p>I wrote up a long description of a simple example which shows how this
<br>
might work, at:
<br>
<a href="http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::CXYQFktI-RH4a-Wgki-YXwg-PRttPgVTJBtH">http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::CXYQFktI-RH4a-Wgki-YXwg-PRttPgVTJBtH</a>.
<br>
<p>Another counter-intuitive aspect of this result is that the &quot;path&quot;
<br>
to agreement is random.  Intuitively, we might become convinced that
<br>
disputants will come to agreement eventually just by knowledge of each
<br>
other's opinions, where one will gradually come to accept that the other's
<br>
stubbornness is a sign that he must have good grounds for his beliefs.
<br>
So we would expect that each side would cling to his own position,
<br>
until finally one or the other capitulates.
<br>
<p>This is not at all what Robin's paper predicts!  Instead, for a typical
<br>
dispute, say one with just two possible positions, each participant has
<br>
a 50-50 chance of changing his mind on every round.  Here is a typical
<br>
dialog among rational disagreers:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMY                                        BOB
<br>
<p>I don't think capital punishment             I believe capital punishment
<br>
reduces crime.                               does reduce crime.
<br>
<p><p>Oh, really?  Then I now think that           You don't say!  In that case I
<br>
capital punishment does reduce               now believe that capital punishment
<br>
crime.                                       does not reduce crime.
<br>
<p><p>Well!  Therefore I have now gone back        Oh? Then I now believe again that
<br>
to my original position, that capital        capital punishment does reduce
<br>
punishment does not reduce crime.            crime.
<br>
<p><p>Hmmm...  Even so, I will stay with my        Wow.  In that case I will now accept
<br>
previous position that capital punishment    your original statement, that capital
<br>
does not reduce crime.                       punishment does not reduce crime.
<br>
<p><p>Then we agree!                               Then we agree!
<br>
<p><p>This should be read as though the two parties are saying their lines
<br>
simultaneously, Alice and Bob reacting to the statements by the other
<br>
party that are on the line above.  They don't hear what the other person
<br>
says on the same line until after they finish saying it.
<br>
<p>As you will see, each side changed sides several times, until one
<br>
side did not change sides while the other did, and then they agreed.
<br>
Believe it or not, this is the predicted path to agreement among people
<br>
who are mutually rational.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, this is a highly unusual dialog.  I would venture to
<br>
suggest that virtually no one in the history of the human race has
<br>
ever engaged in an argument about a contested issue which followed
<br>
this pattern.
<br>
<p>Now, I think one reason is that this is the discussion which will occur
<br>
if people are constrained to only describe their opinions.  And in that
<br>
case, there is a problem.  While we can guarantee that people will come to
<br>
agreement, there is no guarantee that the agreement is correct.  In fact,
<br>
the agreement reached by this method may not be the agreement which would
<br>
have been reached if each had access to all of the information held by
<br>
the other.  The latter agreement is more informed, and therefore more
<br>
useful for survival.
<br>
<p>So our conventional pattern, which is to exchange the reasons for our
<br>
beliefs, is actually superior in terms of providing information useful
<br>
for survival.  Nevertheless, I suspect that upon an exchange like this,
<br>
where each party says &quot;I believe X for reason Y&quot;, it would be appropriate
<br>
for the participants to adjust their beliefs along the lines above.
<br>
They might continue to discuss and give their reasons, but their
<br>
beliefs about which side is likely to be right should switch back and
<br>
forth randomly.  It might even be that once they reach agreement, they
<br>
would want to continue to exchange information about the pros and cons
<br>
of their position, and this might cause them to fall out of agreement
<br>
at some point, which can't happen with the simple model above.  But by
<br>
adopting this more complex process, more information is exchanged and
<br>
people make better decisions.
