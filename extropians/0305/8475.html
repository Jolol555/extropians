<em>&gt; This brings me to the Ragged-Trousered Philosopher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal">http://www.fullmoon.nu/articles/art.php?id=tal</a>), and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation with God (the God, not some poor poser):
</em><br>
<p>Hey fun story. Thanks for posting. When I was about 19 and
<br>
an atheist I had a similar sort of dream. Difference was that it was the
<br>
Devil I didn't believe in not God that I found myself confronted
<br>
with. He was some sort of 30 something business suit clad collossus
<br>
standing waist deep in the middle of shallow bay addressing me on
<br>
the beach. He'd dispensed with a few &quot;unverbalised&quot; questions with
<br>
some blaize displays of supernatural rock blasting but he was really
<br>
more interested in rational discourse and argument. I think it was
<br>
mostly about the absurdity of ethics and morality but can't remember
<br>
the details except that I though he made a very strong case.
<br>
<p>In the Ragged-Trousered Philosopher I found it interesting that God 
<br>
too was an atheist. Apparently he didn't see the *need* to believe in 
<br>
hinself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think the dangers of genetic warfare are serious, imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovering a secret thought or program, accessible to any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent individual, which, if abused, will eliminate your species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantly. If your progress  continues as is, then you can expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover that particular self-destruct mechanism in less than 10,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years. Your species has got to grow up considerably before you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can afford to make that discovery. And if you don't make it, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never leave your Solar System and join the rest of the sapient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species on level two.'
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Well-worth reading.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. But I didn't see why the species boundary was such a binding 
<br>
force. Why was species survivial the point? Don't species natually 
<br>
split? Seems we've just been through another interation of how 
<br>
easy it is for people to draw arbitrary lines around certain groups
<br>
of people redefining in-crowds and out-crowds as the circumstances
<br>
suit.
<br>
<p>Also the emphasis on the need to develop fusion power as a liberating
<br>
energy source. I probably mistook that as a reference to cold fusion
<br>
when cheap fusion was meant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's hope his worries are unfounded, and we'll find ways of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advancing to the next stage in development, without the fear of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deadly attacks during the  next Extro.
</em><br>
<p>I reckon the next Extro is safe. Perhaps in no small part because
<br>
the next Extro is unlikely to be seen as a serious threat to anyone.
<br>
<p>I think I accept the theses that in order for an intelligent desperate 
<br>
person to cause havoc (terrorists, or perhaps a better example 
<br>
Timothy McVeigh) all the is necessary is that they be willing to give
<br>
up their lives as a sacrifice. Fortunately probably more people are
<br>
capable of acquiring the destructive knowledge base but far fewer
<br>
will adopt the perspective that their own lives are so worth the price
<br>
of making their point.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oklahoma bombings&quot; as incidents are one thing, are we going to see
<br>
them as a sort of syndrome? What if anything is the defence?
<br>
