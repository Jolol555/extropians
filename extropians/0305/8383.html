<em>&gt;        It is strange that you bring my name up.  I'll bet that if you check 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the archives you will find I rarely start a political discussion -- perhaps 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I specifically did not wish to bring your name up. I just replied to
<br>
your post because it was the latest one that used the terms Left and
<br>
Right as if they were some reified Thing. I'm absolutely not against
<br>
political discussion: like I said, I think it can be relevant to us, but
<br>
getting emotionally involved with your &quot;side&quot;, be that &quot;Left&quot; or &quot;Right&quot;
<br>
is almost a guarantee that no opinions will be changed, no resolutions
<br>
will be made, and polarisation will render the discussion quite
<br>
meaningless to onlookers.
<br>
<p>Lee makes an interesting point as to whether this kind of entrenchment
<br>
is inevitable. He suspects yes, and I have to agree that human nature
<br>
makes it likely. An &quot;Us versus Them&quot; attitude seems evolutionarily
<br>
advantageous. The genes that built the human body and brain cared not
<br>
for cooperation, only for conflict with competing genes. Cooperation
<br>
clearly evolved at some point, memetically or genetically, but the
<br>
animal instinct to split the world into two simple groups still prevails
<br>
occasionally. Maybe even most of the time. I consider &quot;Me vs. Him&quot;, &quot;Us
<br>
vs. Them&quot;, &quot;This tribe vs. That tribe&quot;, &quot;This nation vs. That nation&quot;,
<br>
&quot;This ideology vs. That ideology&quot; to be manifestations of the same
<br>
thing. Whatever the cause is, I believe it is a quirk of natural
<br>
selection that should, at least in principle, yield to superrationality.

</em><br>
<p>I think that would require nothing less than a complete explanation of
<br>
the human mind :)
<br>
<p>Incidentally Lee, I hadn't seen the Nolan chart before. Thanks for the
<br>
pointer. I still think it's just the two dimensional analogue of the
<br>
left/right fallacy, but less fallacious. To increase the accuracy,
<br>
should we add more dimensions? Again, a perfectly accurate chart would
<br>
be the universe itself, with all its unanalysable nonlinearity.
<br>
<p>This remind me of the Myers-Briggs personality types. That partions
<br>
personality into 16 groups, rather than 2. The granularity is increased,
<br>
and with it the accuracy, but it's still not perfect. Refining the
<br>
dissection would cover more edge cases, but increase the complexity,
<br>
which such models are designed to reduce.
<br>
<p>I believe the underlying question is about simple, linear models of
<br>
complex nonlinear phenomenons. At what level of complexity does the
<br>
model cease to be sufficiently useful? At what level of simplicity does
<br>
the model cease to be sufficiently accurate?
<br>
<p>I won't pretend to have thought hard enough about this to offer an
<br>
answer, but I know the Left/Right model is so innacurate that it's
<br>
invariably used as a weapon rather than a useful simplification.
