There are quite rarely only two choices.  E.g., &quot;Yes, No, Wait a bit 
<br>
longer to decide&quot; is a simple rephrasal of the answers &quot;Should we 
<br>
invade?&quot;.  A real consideration would have a variety of different 
<br>
options.  (My preference is still a bounty posted on not only Saddam, 
<br>
but also on the heads of his government departments, and all supervisors 
<br>
and higher in his tax collection agency.  It's bad, but you would injure 
<br>
fewer innocents than a war would.  And they *were* supporting an evil 
<br>
tyrant.)  If it's &quot;Should we have invaded?&quot; (which is going to involve 
<br>
second-guessing) then Yes or No could be extended to include &quot;We should 
<br>
have done it differently&quot;, and &quot;We should have done something else&quot; (I'm 
<br>
interpreting No as meaning &quot;We shouldn't have gotten involved&quot;, but 
<br>
there are clearly lots of other possible meanings.)

One doesn't exactly adopt an agenda to back one's decision.  One makes 
<br>
one's decision in conformance with one's agenda, and reflecting one's 
<br>
knowledge of the situation.  This moves one to a new place which is 
<br>
likely to alter the agenda, so the decision, if remade, is likely to be 
<br>
different.  Part of this is different information being present, and 
<br>
part of it is that the new position provides different opportunities for 
<br>
action.
