<p><em>&gt; I have a few comments:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 - Can you post a [DISCUSS] in response to an [FYI]? If not, a [COMMENT] is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required in between, which seems unnecessarily limiting.
</em><br>
<p>That's true. But ideally, we'd only COMMENT about things we know about. 
<br>
Since DISCUSSions are totally open, this would allow us to post anything 
<br>
whatsoever.
<br>
<p>{henceforth I'll just Uppercase the initial letter of the options).
<br>
<p>For example, an Fyi comes in about some medical biochemical process 
<br>
perhaps too complex for the layman to comprehend. Inviting immediate 
<br>
Discussion means anyone can pick up the word 'medical' and launch into a 
<br>
provocative defense of govt funded health care. This will be responded 
<br>
to easily by any crank with a reply button. The extra effort required 
<br>
make a Comment before (someone else) can initiate a Discussion may serve 
<br>
as a filter.
<br>
<p>I sorta do this myself: I get extropy daily digest (but don't open it), 
<br>
read the BBS forum, and reply in email. I have to compose each message, 
<br>
cutting and pasting subject, quotes, person who I'm quoting, to address, 
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Of course two or more listmembers could collaborate on defeating the system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2 - It'd never work on the extropians list; this list is a free-for-all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (both its greatest strength &amp; weakness). You'd need to set up a new list to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce the rules on, likely including human or automated moderation to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the job.
</em><br>
<p>True. I would really recommend that we all get blogs and start blogging. 
<br>
Blog your posts to extropians. (I'm waiting for TypePad, personally.) 
<br>
Until then anyone could start using this system (or any other system) 
<br>
unless the listowners really insist on stuff like [WAR] and [IRAQ]. In 
<br>
this way conformance to the system is voluntary, and you might get a 
<br>
better s/r ratio by filtering out emails not in compliance with the system.
<br>
<p>It'd be interesting to build a range of systems, code it in XML and XSL, 
<br>
and sort of let them evolve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3 - It's a bit cumbersome, given that you can't just hit &quot;REPLY&quot;. It'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice if the moderation automation did the following: [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You should be able to guess the correct format for most posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are incorrectly formatted, and reformat them appropriately, otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bounce them.
</em><br>
<p>Automation is always good.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
