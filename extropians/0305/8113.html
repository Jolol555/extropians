<p>I am still not seeing how or why you hold Michael Fumento morally culpable

for all those deaths?  Did you read this book?  I havent, but reading

comments on it I think you misjudged its content.  Please explain your line

of reasoning that holds Fumento direclty morally culpable for any deaths in

Africa from AIDS.  Was he over there plunging used needles into people, and
<br>
forcing idiots with AIDS to rape virgins?  Shall we blame him, and not the
<br>
people who actually committ these heinous acts, or the corrupt tyrannical
<br>
governments and warring fanctions that keep the people in africa ignorant,

poor, unhealthy, and superstitious?

<br>
<p>Reviewer: Stephen M. St. Onge (see more about me) from Minneapolis, MN
<br>
In the early days of the epidemic, it was rational to worry that AIDS might
<br>
'explode through the general population.' Once the HIV virus was isolated,
<br>
and a little known about how it spread, it became obvious that it just
<br>
wasn't possible.
<br>
<p>Back in 1987, Michael Fumento wrote an article in Commentary which told why
<br>
the general heterosexual population was not at signifigant risk for AIDS. He
<br>
thought everyone would be glad to know that tens of millions of USAmericans
<br>
would NOT die of an incurable disease associated with incredible suffering.
<br>
<p>Wrong.
<br>
<p>Lots of people wanted everyone at risk, or, at least, wanted everyone to
<br>
believe that everyone was at risk, regardless of whether or not it was true.
<br>
Fumento was denounced, harassed, and, lied about for stating that most AIDS
<br>
victims would continue to be male homosexuals, IV drug users, women in a
<br>
long term relationship with men in the first two groups, and children of
<br>
women with HIV.
<br>
<p>The terrible thing is, that, by saying &quot;Everyone is equally at risk,&quot; those
<br>
at high risk didn't get the information they needed to protect themselves.
<br>
Thousands died in the U.S. because they were deliberately misinformed about
<br>
AIDS by those with political agendas to push -- agendas they weren't willing
<br>
to argue for honestly.
<br>
<p>Thirteen years later, the story continues. Very few cases of AIDS are
<br>
contracted heterosexually, except for the women sleeping regularly with
<br>
bisexuals and drug users, and Fumento continues to be denounced. Even people
<br>
whom came to agree with him, such as Gabriel Rotello, felt it necessary to
<br>
say nasty things about him -- things that weren't true, by the way. And
<br>
those whom WANT heterosexuals to be at high risk for AIDS continue to claim
<br>
Fumento was wrong, as you can see by looking at some other reviews on this
<br>
page.
<br>
<p>The one thing you won't see is facts to back up their assertions, for the
<br>
simple reason that there are none.
<br>
<p>Read this book if you want a fascinating account of how the truth about a
<br>
terrible disease was surpressed. And check out Fumento.com to find out the
<br>
latest lies being spread about AIDS -- but only if you value the truth above
<br>
political correctness.
<br>
<p>Next review -
<br>
<p>Book Review for: The Myth of Heterosexual Aids, Michael Fumento, 1990, 1993
<br>
<p>AIDS - The Truth Shall Educate You
<br>
<p>The Author: Every now and then a person comes along who lives a passion for
<br>
finding and sharing truth. He is not satisfied with merely being well-fed
<br>
and lying as needed to optimize his professional stature. He takes the
<br>
risks, endures the persecution and keeps on fighting. Such is Michael
<br>
Fumento.
<br>
<p>The Book: It would take no less than Fumento's 463 pages (with 47 pages of
<br>
references and notes) to unravel over a decade of lies emanating from the
<br>
practitioners of AIDS-transmitting behaviors, the media, and the most
<br>
visible public health professionals. I can see that there is still a need
<br>
for this message today when I talk with misled others, when I see misleading
<br>
public transit AIDS ads and when I hear the news.
<br>
<p>Values: If I went into this book looking for a gay-bashing tirade I would
<br>
not find it. If I approached it with the attitude of (some) Christians that
<br>
homosexuals deserve to die because of their behavior, I would not find any
<br>
support from Fumento. If I went into this book feeling 100% not responsible
<br>
for the spread of this disease I would encounter explanation that we are all
<br>
responsible at least indirectly because of our ignorance, gullibility and
<br>
tolerance of titillating and shabby news-reporting. What is this guy's
<br>
agenda, anyway? Fumento could just as easily have chosen issues other than
<br>
AIDS (and he has done this in other articles and books) to further his
<br>
agenda, which seems to be to expose the misdeeds of alarmists, the media and
<br>
health professionals who have abused perfectly good science as they
<br>
furthered their own careers at the expense of victims of disease and
<br>
ignorance.
<br>
<p>Educational Value: I recommend this book for enhancing one's practical and
<br>
logical understanding of: AIDS transmission physiology and psychology;
<br>
AIDS-enabling co-morbidity; epidemiology; statistics; public health systems;
<br>
the media; and news analysis. Also, one can learn numerous well-documented,
<br>
less-promoted facts about AIDS. And by studying the behaviors of some public
<br>
health officials one might identify morality conflicts for some of his own
<br>
potential career choices.
<br>
<p>Reading Level and Data: Sometimes I had to re-read paragraphs because some
<br>
of the logic and statistical thinking was new to me. But, a thorough grasp
<br>
of statistics in epidemiology is not essential. After all, how much
<br>
sophistication does it take to understand Fumento's copiously explained
<br>
statements (abbreviated here): that receptive anal intercourse (for men or
<br>
women) is by far the most AIDS-risky sexual behavior; or that early
<br>
homosexual AIDS victims each averaged almost 1100 lifetime partners (1
<br>
survey); or that among heterosexuals it is overwhelmingly the partners of
<br>
intravenous drug abusers (IVDA) who are at highest risk; or that
<br>
blood-transfusion-infected heterosexuals often required years, with regular
<br>
intercourse, to infect their wives; or that female prostitutes in the United
<br>
States do little to spread AIDS, but do sometimes acquire it from pimps or
<br>
boyfriends; or that there is increased risk in vaginal intercourse if women
<br>
are menstruating, have an infection or have another STD; or that in
<br>
heterosexual lifestyles it is the character of, not the number of sexual
<br>
partners that determines a woman's AIDS risk; or that about ten times as
<br>
many native-born American males are diagnosed with breast cancer each year
<br>
as are diagnosed with AIDS from heterosexual intercourse; or that there are
<br>
also major differences in AIDS transmission rates depending on gender,
<br>
race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status and inner-city vs. suburban living, or
<br>
that in 1993 AIDS was continuing to receive about 20 times as much per death
<br>
as cancer in federal research and education dollars?
<br>
<p>Why Read About AIDS? I believe that, there is a learning obligation for the
<br>
lucky ones who do not get AIDS. For example, if everyone whose relative or
<br>
loved one got AIDS were to broadly self-educate about AIDS, there would be a
<br>
great reduction of suffering in the land - because victims would be better
<br>
understood, because solutions could more likely be found, and because it
<br>
would create &quot;public supervision&quot; of public health officials, activists,
<br>
authors and the media. While Fumento does not dwell on the horrors of the
<br>
AIDS illness, he does explain how those horrors have been imparted to
<br>
(probably) thousands of excess persons in this country because funds had
<br>
been diverted from categories of persons who were known to be at highest
<br>
risk, and had been invested instead on those known to be at extremely low
<br>
risk. But this was after huge waste in paying for professional salaries and
<br>
media campaigns.
<br>
<p>What about Africa? Anyone who doubts any significant heterosexual AIDS
<br>
prevalence in the USA (aside from that of partners of IVDA) is asked why we
<br>
hear of a large heterosexual AIDS prevalence in Africa. Fumento explains: 1)
<br>
Part of the African AIDS prevalence actually is from lied-about male
<br>
homosexual behaviors. 2) There are rampant malaria, STD's and other diseases
<br>
which have already weakened immune systems, increasing AIDS vulnerability.
<br>
3) There is severe limitation on the availability of health care and
<br>
medications. 4) During earlier phases of the epidemic there was no money to
<br>
pay for the testing of donated blood or for eliminating re-use of needles in
<br>
hospitals. 5) Prostitutes with STD's can't get medical treatment. 6) Africa
<br>
has a few high-prevalence AIDS regions just as the USA does - but the media
<br>
has tended to report a high prevalence over broad regions of Africa.
<br>
<p>Hate crimes: At least in the 1980's and early 1990's, homosexual activists,
<br>
some public health professionals and the media vigorously promoted
<br>
exaggerations of AIDS prevalence and predictions, with some even
<br>
&quot;foreseeing&quot; the demise of the civilization. Given that some of the public
<br>
actually believed these exaggerations and also saw through the lies of the
<br>
media which denied the predominance of homosexual behavior and intravenous
<br>
drug abuse in AIDS causation, it is surprising there was not more violence.
<br>
<p>Since this important book has nearly always been unavailable from libraries
<br>
and bookstores readers can increase awareness by carrying it with them as a
<br>
conversation starter, or by
<br>
seeking advice from everyone they meet about how to obtain a copy, or by
<br>
referring everyone to on-line book reviews. It is interesting to show and
<br>
discuss the book with bookstore salespeople. - Bill Norwood
