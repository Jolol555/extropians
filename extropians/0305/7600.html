<p>I didn't feel that one was necessary because it so bloody obvious. Note
<br>
that it wasn't *I* who defined you as an idiot.
<br>
<p>For the thought impaired: feeding wild animals expands their food
<br>
supply beyond what the natural environment provides. This is generally
<br>
done by well meaning fools who have a naive and selfish need to be able
<br>
to view wildlife out their livingroom or kitchen window in order to
<br>
prove to themselves:
<br>
<p>a) they love and care for animals so much
<br>
b) they live in a clean and pure environment
<br>
c) they have acheived their goal of living in harmony with nature, or
<br>
some other such insipid tree-hugger bambi-lover blather.
<br>
<p>Like self-absorbed pet owners who think it is quite alright to send a
<br>
pet to the animal shelter when their own lives get too busy to properly
<br>
care for the pet they thought was so cute and cuddly when it was young,
<br>
the above sort of individuals never consider that:
<br>
<p>a) there is nobody feeding their 'pet' wildlife when they are out of
<br>
town
<br>
b) there will be nobody feeding their 'pet' wildlife when they cash out
<br>
on the appreciated value of their McMansion and move to Palm Springs.
<br>
c) feeding wildlife creates a dependency and causes wildlife to forget
<br>
the ability to forage for natural food sources
<br>
d) an increased artificial food source will cause wildlife populations
<br>
to exceed the local environments natural ability to support.
<br>
e) concentrating wildlife in a settled area makes them a target for
<br>
dogs and cats. When deer, for example, are chased by loose dogs in the
<br>
dead of winter, their energy reserves are quickly exhausted and they
<br>
die nasty deaths.
<br>
f) concentrating wildlife near settled areas makes them more likely to
<br>
be victimized by traffic accidents as they cross roads more often to
<br>
seek out human provided food.
<br>
g) when you get too busy with your life, or you go on vacation, or you
<br>
move away, those animals are going to go without the food you provided
<br>
and suffer accordingly. Being dependent on your munificense, they are
<br>
no longer able to forage for themselves and are far more likely to
<br>
become prey to weather and loose dogs.
<br>
<p>Unlike bambi-lovers, I demonstrate my love of deer by shooting loose
<br>
dogs in the winter time. I don't feed the deer, and I hunt them in
<br>
areas where their numbers are excessive for the environment. 
<br>
<p>Those who claim they love animals but are ignorant of wildlife
<br>
managment principles tend to come into this state from the city, buy up
<br>
tracts of wilderness, then post them as off limits to hunting. This
<br>
always results in large numbers of deer-car traffic accidents on roads
<br>
bordering these properties, as the deer population is unregulated and
<br>
explodes, forcing them to cross the roads to seek out food sources.
<br>
<p>These fools don't realize they cause more suffering than they prevent.
