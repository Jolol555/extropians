<p>I believe Mike was referencing other studies mentioned in addition to the
<br>
one Brian mentioned.
<br>
<p>In any case please read our words again, Harvey. Brian was pointing out that
<br>
the authors gave no reason to believe fiber from grains is superior to any
<br>
other kind of plant fiber. I was merely agreeing with Brian. Neither of us
<br>
were reinterpreting the study to &quot;say the opposite of what the original
<br>
authors said.&quot; Brian and I were merely recognizing that the study helps to
<br>
confirm the paleodiet principle that one should eat a diet rich in plant
<br>
fiber.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The original studies advocated a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of grains in the diet. 
</em><br>
<p>No, here it is you who are reinterpreting the study. The authors are not
<br>
recommending a &quot;high-grain&quot; diet, per se. They are recommending a
<br>
*high-fiber* diet rich in plant fiber from three known sources: grains,
<br>
fruits and vegetables. They make no distinction between the three sources of
<br>
fiber, nor should they.
<br>
<p>And as I stated in my follow-up message to Brian, other studies show that
<br>
diets rich in fiber from nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables (not from
<br>
grain) give protection against cancer and heart disease. This suggests
<br>
further that there is nothing unique about grain fiber vs. fiber from
<br>
fruits/veggies. One might just as well obtain all of one's fiber from
<br>
nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables rather than from high-calorie,
<br>
high-carb, low-nutrient-density grain products.
