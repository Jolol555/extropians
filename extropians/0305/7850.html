<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If the name-calling occurs in the context even of a valid argument, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;still, imo, appropriate to consider it ad hominem because of the additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*implied* argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I were making a documentary about the Holocaust it is not inconceivable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the word &quot;monster&quot; would creep in regarding my description of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazis, perhaps the word &quot;evil&quot; too. If you object to this then it proves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that political correctness is not the exclusive domain of the far left.
</em><br>
<p>I'd have no *objection* to the usage of this word &quot;creeping in&quot;
<br>
as you say.  I agree with gts, though, but more so:  the degree
<br>
to which your presentation *depends* on such language, the weaker
<br>
it is.
<br>
<p>I consider the use of such phrases, e.g. &quot;Communist tyranny&quot;, &quot;monstrous
<br>
evil&quot;, &quot;Nazi madman&quot; to be reality challenges to the reader: do you or
<br>
do you not also agree emotionally?
<br>
<p>Therefore, (and we've all seen it), an unending barrage of such
<br>
defamatory terms isn't to the point, because what's the use of
<br>
repeatedly making the same challenge in a single work?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ...then also call you an idiot for believing in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Easter Bunny, my name-calling can be seen as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; additional implied ad hominem argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implied argument is that the person has displayed such profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupidity that it would be a waste of time to pay attention to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds he may make with his mouth, a perfectly valid bit of advice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my opinion.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that after a while, you can write some people off, at
<br>
least as regards some issues.  But this is seldom &quot;profound
<br>
stupidity&quot;.  More often it's ideological blindness, or (what
<br>
may amount to the same thing) repeated misperception of human
<br>
nature (or the nature of some particular humans).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you really disagree, do you really think the person was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an idiot? The word has a meaning, there must be times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it is appropriate to use it and if not then when?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or perhaps you think the word &quot;idiot&quot; should be expunged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the English Language.
</em><br>
<p>This is an extremely interesting point.  I don't really grok
<br>
Damien's &quot;assessment&quot; analysis or its relevance, but I do
<br>
think that he's right to question the *role* that the
<br>
terms are playing here.  I liken the use of &quot;idiot&quot; to that
<br>
of &quot;shit!&quot;.  It seems to be like an expletive, having little
<br>
or no objective meaning, but instead useful as indicating the
<br>
speaker's judgment (or assessment), or emotional disposition.
<br>
<p>And again, there are at least several ways that conveying the
<br>
emotional or judgmental take of the speaker is useful:  one,
<br>
as said, is that it offers a challenge to the listener, 
<br>
implying the possibility that the listener could or should
<br>
review his semantic links, e.g. &quot;Saddam's monstrous tyranny&quot;.
<br>
Another, as said, is the implied claim that the target's views
<br>
are unreliable, at least on one issue.  Lastly, it can be 
<br>
useful to know the result of the speaker's own emotional 
<br>
calculations, not only for whatever value that would generate
<br>
itself, but as a guide to the speaker's further actions and words.
<br>
