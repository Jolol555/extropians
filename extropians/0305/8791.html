<em>&gt; Major spoilers below.  I analyze the movie in detail.  I make
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; |
</em><br>
I'm gonna spoil some of Mez' spoilers, cause there is a lot I disagree
<br>
with. I just got home from seeing the movie, and here is what I
<br>
think...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; |
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |
</em><br>
<em>&gt; |
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, I saw this a second time.  Here's what I think is going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First of all, I reject the idea of a matrix within the matrix.  Zion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in base reality.  I believe this for reasons Brian Atkins has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already posted and also for the following meta-reasons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Such a plot resolution would not be satisfying to most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matrix's audience.
</em><br>
<p>Satsifying the Matrix's audience is not important. &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a
<br>
luddite memetic program to root for the Zionist cause, and therefore to
<br>
prepare them to support luddism and the luddite agenda of preventing a
<br>
technological singularity.... As this becomes more clear, the movies
<br>
depend more on special effects to numb the minds of the audience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the real them of Reloaded and of the resolution of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Revolutions is symbiosis between man and machine.  At the end of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Revolutions the humans and some machines will both be alive and on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their way to co-existing in some positive-sum way.
</em><br>
<p>This may be the ultimate result, and if it is, I take back my previous
<br>
statement. The problem with this is the background philosophy of
<br>
control prevalent in the movie. &quot;Choice is an illusion created between
<br>
the powerful and the powerless.&quot; This machiavellian outlook is an
<br>
essential component of socialist dialectic and revolutionary theory.
<br>
<p>It appears that the Architect and the Oracle have different agendas.
<br>
The Oracle may believe in a coexistence solution. The only coexistence
<br>
solution the Architect believes in is one in which humans are
<br>
subservient. The Oracle knows this, which is why she uses Neo AND the
<br>
Architect to her own ends. The Architect thinks he knows the Oracle,
<br>
and thinks he is using her to his ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are a couple important conversations in Reloaded about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbiosis:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) The Oracle says &quot;I care about the future.  And the only way to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is *together*.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) The councilor talks to Neo about the codependence of the humans in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zion and their machines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, that's the resolution the plot is heading for.  Now, here are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some details of what I think is going on with Neo, the past Ones, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Architect, etc..
</em><br>
<p>If this is the resolution of the plot, then the Wachowskis are intent
<br>
on taking what they see as an essentially luddite/humanist audience and
<br>
hauling them halfway to acceptance of the Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Neo is indeed the 6th entity called &quot;the One&quot; in the Matrix,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though he is also different from the past entities.  Evidence:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1a) Smith says &quot;it's happening just as before&quot; when he sees Neo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kick the butts of the three agents at the beginning.  Then Smith #2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows up and says &quot;well, not quite&quot;.  This indicates to me that Smith
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been around in past versions of the Matrix.  But in past versions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Matrix, Smith has never broken free and gained the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicate himself.  This is also consistent with Smith telling Neo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;you did something I thought wasn't possible, you destroyed me&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That had never happened to Smith in his battles with previous Ones. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They'd beaten him, but never as deeply.  Smith has now gone rogue in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Matrix.  He says &quot;I knew the rules, I knew what I was supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do, but I didn't.  I stayed.&quot;  
</em><br>
<p>Smith is an anti-virus program that failed in his core function, became
<br>
perveted by the virus called Neo, and now runs amok in the Matrix,
<br>
assimilating other individuals and programs and replicating himself in
<br>
them. What changed in him was that in seeing that Neo can break the
<br>
rules of the Matrix, he can too. His new subconcious goal is no
<br>
different from his original goal, he is simply freed from restrictions
<br>
in achieving it. He therefore has concluded that the only way to
<br>
protect everyone from the luddites (Neo in particular) is to assimilate
<br>
everybody they come into contact with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1b) The Merovingian tells Neo &quot;I survived your predecessors&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which indicates past One's.  But he also says &quot;your predecessors had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more respect&quot;, which indicates a difference between Neo and previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ones.
</em><br>
<p>This is naturally the result of Neo being a different 'remainder
<br>
function' than past One's because the equations of this Matrix are
<br>
different than past Matrices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1c) The Architect of course tells Neo that there have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous Ones, but he also at one points says &quot;interesting.  you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figured that out faster than the others&quot; which indicates again that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neo is different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1d) Also, if the Architect gave past Ones a choice similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neo's, and we believe what the Architect is saying, the past Ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *must* have chosen to return to the source, pick a few people from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zion, and re-create it. Otherwise humanity would now be extinct.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neo chose differently, again pointing out a difference between him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and past Ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Neo has his powers in the Matrix because the compromise in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of the Matrix is that humans must be able to at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subconsciously choose whether or not to accept the Matrix.  Neo is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the very rare individuals who can partially accept it and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reject it, allowing him to bend its rules of physics.  The existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of such individuals is an unfortunate but inevitable side effect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving people a subconscious choice.  And giving people a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice is, as the Architect tells us, the only technique found so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gets such a large number of humans to accept the Matrix. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, most people, given a choice, will choose the choice they have been
<br>
memetically programmed to choose. Those that do not are cast out,
<br>
either killed off by Agent Smith and his colleagues, or else rescued by
<br>
the Zionists.
<br>
<p>Neo was engineered to fulfill the position of the remainder function.
<br>
Because it is a remainder, he posesses more than the single integer
<br>
capabilities of a standard human.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is basically straight out of the Architect's speech, but makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sense in the second viewing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) The Architect believes that the warping effect on the Matrix of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either Neo ignoring so many physical laws or perhaps side effects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will result in the complete violation of the Matrix's rules and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a crash of the entire simulation.  That is why the Architect tells 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neo that if he goes back into the Matrix without first going to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and having his code disseminated, he will cause a crash in the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will kill everyone human plugged into the Matrix.  This is again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straight out of the Architect's speech, but makes more sense in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context of why Neo has his powers (see #2, above).
</em><br>
<p>Keep in mind that the Architect serves his own ends. What he tells Neo
<br>
may or may not be the truth, or even the whole truth, just as the
<br>
Oracle, in Matrix I, tells Neo only what he needed to know to become
<br>
The One (i.e. that he wasn't it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) The Architect will be found to be wrong.  Neo is more special than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the previous Ones, and either his greater power or greater control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his powers or something else special about him will allow him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that total crash.  Instead he will liberate the humans plugged into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Matrix without causing all their deaths. 
</em><br>
<p>The architect is wrong only because he doesn't realize that Neo will
<br>
deduce the fact of 'reality' outside the Matrix, that it is, itself, a
<br>
simulation, as evidenced by the fact that people killed inside the
<br>
Matrix die in reality outside of it. This should not be so. They should
<br>
only die in reality if that reality is itself a simulation, a sort of
<br>
buffer area intent on catching up individuals who escape &quot;The Matrix&quot;.
<br>
It is a 'honey pot', not the real root reality.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) It seems plausible to me that Persephone really is the &quot;intuitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program created to investigate human emotions&quot; that the Architect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talks about.  The Oracle is definitely not it based on his reaction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the whole &quot;Mother of the Matrix&quot; thing is a bit over hyped.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The intuitive program just basically made the realization that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans plugged into the Matrix had a subconscious choice about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participation, more of them would accept the illusion.  The Architect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still the one who built the Matrix and put that attribute into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure. At this point, it seems to me that the Oracle is indeed
<br>
the Mother. How exactly Persephone fits in is not entirely clear,
<br>
though her exploration of Neo's kissing skills does hint at this
<br>
possibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6) Smith is very simple.  He is a program that has served as an Agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for several versions now.  In that role he (and the other agents) had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited access to information.  They were not omnipotent over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matrix as a whole, clearly.  In any case, once some of Neo's code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imprinted on him, Smith has gained the ability to replicate.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use that ability to completely take over the Matrix, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually use that to take over the AIs computing power as well. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replication ability is something that has not been seen in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous version of the Matrix, and so he represents another wildcard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Architect has not previously dealt with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7) Neo was able to stop the robots at the end because he's touched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the source and is somehow still connected to it.  Exactly how isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe all the humans have wireless hardware.  Maybe some friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program like the Oracle had the wireless hardware implanted in Neo's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain while he was still in the Matrix.  Maybe Neo is a genetic freak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose brain serves as a transmitter and receiver.  Don't know.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything is consistent with him using his connection to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software world to force the robots themselves to self-destruct.  
</em><br>
<p>Notice that he says &quot;Wait, something is different.&quot; This is the same
<br>
line he uses in the first movie when they are in the building and were
<br>
betrayed by Mr. Reagan to Agent Smith, when Neo notices the cat going
<br>
by twice... He notices that reality has been looped after the
<br>
Nebuchadnezzar has been bombed and they are fleeing the Sentinels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So next movie it will be revealed that both Neo and Smith are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unique phenomena not seen in past versions of the Matrix.  Neo will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defeat Smith (possibly incorporating some of his code) and will go on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to liberate the humans plugged into the Matrix, avoid a complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crash of the Matrix, and catalyze a positive symbiosis between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans and some computers (perhaps by going into the Source and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kicking ass).
</em><br>
<p>I think that Smith is now an outlaw program intent on assimilating and
<br>
running copies of himself on all humans as a means of fulfilling his
<br>
prime function (subconciously of course).
