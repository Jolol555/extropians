<p><p>Food Fight
<br>
<p>When the Food Workers Union stages an impromptu walkout
<br>
at the U.N., the diplomats start looting for lunch and booze  
<br>
<p>By STEWART STOGEL/U.N. 
<br>
<p>Saturday, May. 03, 2003
<br>
<p>Hunger pains can apparently turn even the
<br>
most upstanding diplomat into a looter. At
<br>
noon on Friday, food workers at the U.N.
<br>
headquarters walked off their jobs, calling a
<br>
wildcat strike. The result: none of the U.N.'s
<br>
five restaurants and bars was staffed. The
<br>
walkout left thousands of U.N. employees
<br>
scrounging for lunch — eventually, the
<br>
masses stripped the cafeterias of everything,
<br>
including the silverware. 
<br>
<p>The food workers staged a one-day show of muscle after they learned that
<br>
they would not be reimbursed for vacation pay due to a contract shift
<br>
that took place in March. For the past 17 years the U.N. has been under
<br>
contract to Restaurant Associates Inc. (RA). In March, RA lost the
<br>
contract to Aramark Corporation, the largest U.S. food services company.
<br>
According to Aramark executives who spoke to TIME, RA informed the food
<br>
workers on Friday morning that it would only cover vacation pay that was
<br>
issued before May 2nd, the last day of RA's U.N. contract. Any vacation
<br>
pay due after May 2nd              would need to be paid by Aramark. 
<br>
<p>But Aramark informed the Union it would only pay for time worked for
<br>
their company and nothing previous with RA. Aramark told the union that
<br>
whether or not vacation paychecks were to be issued before or after May
<br>
2nd the work in question was performed when RA held the U.N. contract. 
<br>
<p>That was enough to set the food workers walking during the height of
<br>
Friday's lunch hour. After that, what ensued was nothing short of
<br>
Baghdad style chaos. 
<br>
<p>Kofi Annan, who had a private lunch previously scheduled with the
<br>
members of the Security Council in the Delegates Dining Room, found they
<br>
were only served the main course. After that, they were on their own —
<br>
no desserts, no cleanup, no coffee for Kofi. And the service was no
<br>
better for anyone else at the U.N. But as tensions grew and stomachs
<br>
growled, a high-ranking U.N. official boldly ordered that all the
<br>
cafeterias open their doors for business even
<br>
without staff. The restaurants had been locked shut by security until
<br>
about 1:00 pm when the doors flung open. 
<br>
<p>The decision to make the cafeterias into &quot;no pay zones&quot; spread through
<br>
the 40-acre complex like wildfire. Soon, the hungry patrons came
<br>
running. &quot;It was chaos, wild, something out of a war scene,&quot; said one
<br>
Aramark executive who was present. &quot;They took everything, even the
<br>
silverware,&quot; she said. Another witness from U.N. security said the
<br>
cafeteria was &quot;stripped bare.&quot; And another told TIME that the cafeteria
<br>
raid was &quot;unbelievable, crowds of people just         taking everything
<br>
in sight; they stripped the place bare.&quot; And yet another astonished
<br>
witness said that &quot;chickens, turkeys, souffles, casseroles all went out
<br>
the door (unpaid).&quot; 
<br>
<p>The mob then moved on to the Viennese Café, a popular snack bar in the
<br>
U.N.'s conference room facility. It was also stripped bare. The takers
<br>
included some well-known diplomats who finished off the raid with free
<br>
drinks at the lounge for delegates. When asked how much liquor was
<br>
lifted from the U.N. bar, one U.S. diplomat responded: &quot;I stopped
<br>
counting the bottles.&quot; He then excused himself and headed towards the
<br>
men's room. 
<br>
<p>An Aramark executive estimated the food &quot;removed&quot; from the U.N.'s main
<br>
cafeteria at between $7,000 and $9,000 not including the staff
<br>
restaurant, the Viennese Café or the Delegate's Bar. The value of the
<br>
missing silverware has yet to be estimated. 
<br>
<p>Come Monday, the workers should be back at their stations. The dispute
<br>
has been temporarily resolved with the Union agreeing that the vacation
<br>
pay remains RA's responsibility. The Union also wasn't willing to risk
<br>
Aramark's only option of replacing all the workers. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I hope we have large crowds rushing to come to lunch on Monday,&quot; an
<br>
Aramark executive said. &quot;But this time we expect them to pay for what
<br>
they take.&quot;
