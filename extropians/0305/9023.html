<p><p>Super cell discovery raises hopes 
<br>
Scientists have identified a molecule that allows special cells from embryos, 
<br>
called stem cells, to multiply without limit. The UK researchers have dubbed 
<br>
the molecule Nanog, after the mythological Celtic land of the ever young. 
<br>
<p>Stem cells found in embryos are special because they can turn into almost any 
<br>
type of cell in the body, whether it is a heart cell, skin cell or brain 
<br>
cell. 
<br>
<p>Research into these cells is expected to lead to revolutionary new treatments 
<br>
for a range of conditions from Parkinson's Disease to heart failure and 
<br>
diabetes. 
<br>
<p>But the work is controversial because it involves using cells taken from 
<br>
embryos. 
<br>
<p>Key discovery 
<br>
<p>This discovery by a team at the Institute for Stem Cell Research at Edinburgh 
<br>
University could help to overcome that problem. 
<br>
<p>Their finding could ultimately enable scientists to transform stem cells from 
<br>
adults into cells that have all the characteristics of those taken from 
<br>
embryos. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Nanog seems to be a master gene 
<br>
Dr Ian Chambers 
<br>
Dr Ian Chambers, who isolated the molecule, said: &quot;Nanog seems to be a master 
<br>
molecule that makes embryonic stem cells grow in the laboratory. &quot;In effect, 
<br>
this makes stem cells immortal. Being Scottish, I therefore chose the name 
<br>
after the Tir na nOg legend.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Professor Austin Smith, who heads the Edinburgh research team, described the 
<br>
finding as exciting. 
<br>
<p>He said the discovery unlocked the secrets of embryonic stem cells. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This new molecule that we call Nanog, or forever young, is expressed only in 
<br>
these embryonic stem cells. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This molecule alone is powerful enough to define these cells as embryonic 
<br>
stem cells. It is the master molecule.&quot; 
<br>
<p>He said the discovery could help scientists to develop treatments for a 
<br>
variety of conditions. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If Nanog has the same effect in humans as we have found in mice, this will 
<br>
be a key step in developing embryonic stem cells for medical treatments.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The findings were published in the journal Cell, alongside another paper by 
<br>
researchers from the Nara Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. 
<br>
<p>The two groups realised they discovered the same molecule last year and have 
<br>
since collaborated to bring this work to completion.
