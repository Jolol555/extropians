<p>Yes, sterilization is so effective it has to be done very carefully to
<br>
avoid eliminating the population entirely. Not all herds have only one
<br>
breeding male. And there is of course usually more than one herd. I am not
<br>
an expert, but I think sterilization mainly focuses on females. They are
<br>
the real hinge point for reproductive numbers. I don't know what other
<br>
animal social systems might be affected by sterilization. Hunting results
<br>
in the loss of often random herd members - with obvious effects on the
<br>
animal social life. Human predation is also not the same as predation by
<br>
the natural predators. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to mention that being shot by a human hunter is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less &quot;violent&quot; than natural predation.
</em><br>
<p>If the hunter is a good shot, and is trying to shoot right, and
<br>
has a good opportunity. None of which is universally the case, obviously.
