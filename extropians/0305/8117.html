This is the abstract of the research article that Brian mentioned in the
<br>
thread called &quot;eating glycotoxins.&quot; This research is strong evidence that
<br>
humans are not yet adapted to the glycoproteins (AGE's) that are formed when
<br>
meat is cooked. 
<br>
<p>It is also good indirect evidence that humans are not yet adapted to
<br>
non-paleolithic foods in general: if we are not yet adapted to AGE's from
<br>
cooked meats even after ~50 to ~100 thousand years of camp barbecues then
<br>
it's difficult to see how we could be adapted to eating foods that appeared
<br>
in the diet only ~12,000 years ago.
<br>
<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
Inflammatory mediators are induced by dietary glycotoxins, a major risk
<br>
factor for diabetic angiopathy

<br>
<p>Diet is a major environmental source of proinflammatory AGEs (heat-generated
<br>
advanced glycation end products); its impact in humans remains unclear. We
<br>
explored the effects of two equivalent diets, one regular (high AGE, H-AGE)
<br>
and the other with 5-fold lower AGE (L-AGE) content on inflammatory
<br>
mediators of 24 diabetic subjects: 11 in a 2-week crossover and 13 in a
<br>
6-week study. After 2 weeks on H-AGE, serum AGEs increased by 64.5% (P =
<br>
0.02) and on L-AGE decreased by 30% (P = 0.02). The mononuclear cell tumor
<br>
necrosis factor-/-actin mRNA ratio was 1.4 ± 0.5 on H-AGE and 0.9 ± 0.5 on
<br>
L-AGE (P = 0.05), whereas serum vascular adhesion molecule-1 was 1,108 ± 429
<br>
and 698 ± 347 ng/ml (P = 0.01) on L- and H-AGE, respectively. After 6 weeks,
<br>
peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor necrosis factor- rose by 86.3% (P =
<br>
0.006) and declined by 20% (P, not significant) on H- or L-AGE diet,
<br>
respectively; C-reactive protein increased by 35% on H-AGE and decreased by
<br>
20% on L-AGE (P = 0.014), and vascular adhesion molecule-1 declined by 20%
<br>
on L-AGE (P &lt; 0.01) and increased by 4% on H-AGE. Serum AGEs were increased
<br>
by 28.2% on H-AGE (P = 0.06) and reduced by 40% on L-AGE (P = 0.02), whereas
<br>
AGE low density lipoprotein was increased by 32% on H-AGE and reduced by 33%
<br>
on L-AGE diet (P &lt; 0.05). Thus in diabetes, environmental (dietary) AGEs
<br>
promote inflammatory mediators, leading to tissue injury. Restriction of
<br>
dietary AGEs suppresses these effects.
