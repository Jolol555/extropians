</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brett,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You have gotten to the crux of the your misunderstanding.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary American in overwhelming numbers does care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law. They have long been devoted to the love of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law.
</em><br>
<p>Do you really think this is true Ron? Seems to me that international law
<br>
is not an easy thing to love or even to understand, not just for ordinary
<br>
American's but for ordinary natonals of any persuasion. For most of us,
<br>
most of the time its just esoterics. It is damn hard work to try and get
<br>
a real handle on things like the UN Charter or the Geneva Conventions
<br>
if one is an ordinary citizen. Most of us have or choose to do other things
<br>
with our time it seems (and most of the time I'd include myself in that).
<br>
But in the end if international law is to emerge as more that &quot;international
<br>
blaw&quot; as John Clarke put it, then it must have champions. Civilizations
<br>
do not build themselves. And we live and die in the civilizations and
<br>
societies that we build for ourselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        But that same American does not see his country receiving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law.
</em><br>
<p>The key thing about international law I think is that it must be based on
<br>
agreements that if not honoured by one party will be enforced by other
<br>
parties. If as you say Americans don't see themselves *receiving*
<br>
international law at present, they are in probably in pretty much the same
<br>
situation as everyone else. There is no free lunch. Unenforced laws are
<br>
not worth anything. That point has been made on this list by others before
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>I see law and international law, in theory, as essentially simple.
<br>
Agreements
<br>
should be made that are in the interests of all those that make them. If
<br>
they
<br>
are broken it is not the paper form of the agreement but the community
<br>
determined to live in a world of order rather than disorder that should step
<br>
up to enforce those agreements. Unfortunately that requires a pretty active
<br>
and enlightened community, a community that can see things in more than
<br>
black and white.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        When you state lofty ... positions attempting to &quot;reason&quot; with us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do not hear you as reasonable.  We hear only a person that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing one thing strictly for his advantage and trying to talk us into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harming ourselves  for his advantage.
</em><br>
<p>I admit I am talking to you and to others for my advantage. I see
<br>
international law, well founded, realistically based, as being to my
<br>
advantage. I see cooperation where it is possible as preferable. I don't see
<br>
the establishment of a real system of international law as harmful to you.
<br>
Quite to the contrary. But I do see that many will see any particular
<br>
implementation of international law as harmful to them even if it is not in
<br>
practice and that is a problem. The problem with enlightened self
<br>
interest is achieving the necessary enlightened part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  As I said before, &quot;Phony baloney.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Not phoney. Possibly mistaken. Possibly pointless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think it is long since time for Americans to take up the European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy of looking out for their own good, not that of others.
</em><br>
<p>So, on the matter of international law what do you now think is in your
<br>
own good?
<br>
<p>Do you think it is in your own good to elect leaders that are in favor of
<br>
stepping away from the UN as a failed institution? Or do you think it is
<br>
your own good to elect leaders that will try and reform it?
<br>
<p>With respect to international law what policy do you see as being in
<br>
your own good? Is your own good the same or substantially similar
<br>
as the &quot;own good&quot; of all Americans? Seems the trade off in terms of
<br>
short and long term benefits might vary from person to person. An
<br>
older person might be able to adopt an attitude of fortress America
<br>
and never live long enough to see any damage done. The same person
<br>
at much younger age might do the same sort of calculation differently
<br>
don't you think?
