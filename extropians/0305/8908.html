<em>&gt; &gt; Since when does it take an &quot;expert&quot; to accomplish anything?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; History is full of discoveries and advances made by dilletantes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and &quot;fans&quot;. Indeed, &quot;experts&quot; in a field tend to have blinders that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prevent them from seeing solutions that are outside of their training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed, definitely!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However you define an &quot;expert&quot;, my question still stands:  When it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes to future technologies, how many of us are actually involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these fields such that our unique viewpoint really could influence a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design decision, trigger a new avenue of research, or invent/discover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some new solution?  And how many of us work &quot;regular&quot; non-futuristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs and just talk about this stuff over beers in our spare time?
</em><br>
<p>I know from personal experience its possible for non-experts to
<br>
influence political policy at the national level (at least here in
<br>
Australia) I
<br>
don't see why it would be different in similar democratic countries.
<br>
<p>When it comes to legislating around areas that have a high technological
<br>
and ethical component politicians are not experts either but they do
<br>
nonetheless cast the votes that make the laws. Of necessity they get their
<br>
&quot;information&quot; and &quot;expert advice&quot; from somewhere.
<br>
<p>Not being experts in technology like stem cells, and gene therapy, for
<br>
instance it is hard for politicians to &quot;lead&quot; public opinion. Few pollies
<br>
have
<br>
the scientific or subject matter savvy. Therefore they, for the most part
<br>
tend to &quot;follow&quot; public opinion, as it appears to them.
<br>
<p>There are plenty of ways for individuals of the type that frequent lists
<br>
like this to influence public policy in directions that most extropians and
<br>
transhumanists would prefer public policy to go. But it seems one has to
<br>
recognize that before one is willing to try it. And there are of course
<br>
smarter and more effective ways of lobbying than others but so far as
<br>
I can see there is absolutely no magic in it.
