Build It and It Will Work
<br>
The Bush administration's missile defense fantasy.
<br>
By Fred Kaplan
<br>
Posted Thursday, May 22, 2003, at 1:48 PM PT
<br>
<p>The Bush administration seems to be no longer even pretending that its 
<br>
missile defense system will work. More than that, it no longer seems to 
<br>
care. The administration still displays extraordinary support for the 
<br>
program. Its military budget, now before Congress, authorizes $9.1 billion 
<br>
for missile defense next year, with plans for hefty increases each year for 
<br>
long after. The first stages of a system—10 anti-missile interceptors and 
<br>
their launch gear—are scheduled to be deployed in Alaska and California by 
<br>
October 2004.
<br>
<p>But look at the Bush's new National Security Presidential Directive, 
<br>
&quot;National Policy on Ballistic Missile Defense,&quot; an unclassified version of 
<br>
which was released by the White House on May 20. Buried within the 
<br>
five-page statement—the usual litany of prospective threats and strategic 
<br>
rationales—are these two sentences:
<br>
<p>The United States will not have a final, fixed missile defense 
<br>
architecture. Rather, we will deploy an initial set of capabilities that 
<br>
will evolve to meet the changing threat and to take advantage of 
<br>
technological developments.
<br>
<p>&quot;Architecture,&quot; in this context, means pretty much what it means in its 
<br>
colloquial sense: a detailed blueprint with measurements, an underlying 
<br>
design, a notion of how a structure's materials fit together, all rooted in 
<br>
basic principles of physics and engineering.
<br>
<p>For the administration to start deploying a missile defense system before 
<br>
devising an architecture is no different from a construction firm starting 
<br>
to hammer nails, put up joists, and lay out a roof before knowing the style 
<br>
or size of a house.
<br>
<p>Another sign of unreality is the news—revealed this week by Sen. Carl Levin 
<br>
of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services 
<br>
Committee—that the Pentagon has, without explanation, canceled nine of the 
<br>
20 missile defense tests it had planned to conduct between now and 2009. 
<br>
One of the canceled tests—which was to have taken place between April and 
<br>
June 2004 (that is, before deployment begins the following October)—might 
<br>
have marked a major step toward realism-in-testing. For the first time, an 
<br>
interceptor was to have been fired at a missile along the same flight path 
<br>
as that of a missile launched from North Korea. Incidentally, it's not as 
<br>
if the program's test record has been so smashing that its managers can 
<br>
afford to relax their standards—five hits out of eight tries, none of them 
<br>
involving multiple targets, decoys, or realistic trajectories.
<br>
<p>A May 19 article on Bloomberg.com—one of the very few pieces about the 
<br>
canceled tests (alas, the piece is no longer online except to the service's 
<br>
subscribers)—quoted Maj. Gen. Peter Franklin, the Pentagon missile defense 
<br>
agency's deputy director, as justifying the cancellations. &quot;To focus just 
<br>
on the interceptor test alone,&quot; he said, &quot;does not take into consideration 
<br>
everything else that has been built up to get to the point where we 
<br>
are—numerous ground tests, simulations, and war games.&quot;
<br>
<p>Franklin surely knows better. Any American officer who has advanced to the 
<br>
rank of general must have learned, at some point in his career, that ground 
<br>
tests, simulators, and war games are unreliable predictors of what will 
<br>
happen in a flight test of real hardware.
<br>
<p>Sen. Levin, who is oddly the only Democrat who has made a serious go at 
<br>
challenging Bush's rush to deploy this thing, put the matter in better 
<br>
perspective: &quot;The decision to field an as-yet-unproven system has been 
<br>
accompanied by a decision to eliminate or delay the very testing that must 
<br>
be conducted to show whether the system is effective.&quot;
