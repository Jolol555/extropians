Copper Chelation Is A Promising New Therapy For Clogged Arteries
<br>
<p>Researchers at the Maine Medical Center Research Institute (MMCRI) in
<br>
Scarborough, Maine, announce their discovery that the renarrowing of
<br>
arteries following balloon angioplasty can be halted by copper chelation
<br>
therapy. Preventing the function of copper in the body stops arteries
<br>
from reclogging following the mechanical stress of removing arterial
<br>
obstructions through angioplasty. The therapy works by limiting the
<br>
cellular export of growth factors and cytokines involved in this process.
<br>
&quot;This represents a major contribution to medical science,&quot; said Kenneth
<br>
A. Ault, M.D., Director of MMCRI. &quot;This finding could be ready for
<br>
widespread clinical use in humans in a very few years.&quot; Thomas Maciag,
<br>
Ph.D. and his team of scientists at MMCRI's Center for Molecular Medicine
<br>
led a team of investigators from the Netherlands and Bulgaria, including
<br>
scientists from Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. They discovered that
<br>
the function of copper is necessary for restenosis, and that after
<br>
angioplasty or stent surgery is performed, the presence of copper in
<br>
cells of the artery enables the regrowth of cells from within the injured
<br>
vessel. This process recloses the artery in about 30% of cases, requiring
<br>
more surgery with its inherent expense and risk to the patient. &quot;Maciag
<br>
and colleagues appear to have solved a long-lingering paradox in the
<br>
field of growth factor biology,&quot; commented Dr. Elazer R. Edelman,
<br>
Director of Harvard-MIT Biomedical Engineering Center in Cambridge,
<br>
Massachusetts. &quot;Their imaginative work may provide novel treatment
<br>
modalities for a range of critical diseases.&quot;
<br>
<p>This work was published in a preeminent journal, Proceedings of the
<br>
National Academy of Sciences, May 27, 2003, in the paper &quot;Copper
<br>
Chelation Represses the Vascular Response to Injury.&quot;
<br>
The scientists at MMCRI found that the commonly available reagent TTM
<br>
(tetrathiomolybdate), which is a specific copper chelator, stopped
<br>
inflammation and growth of the unwanted new tissue responsible for
<br>
narrowing of the arteries. TTM was able to inhibit the intracellular
<br>
function of key regulators of cell growth which normally enable cells to
<br>
respond to stress. Essentially, chelating copper makes the cells stress
<br>
resistant. Understanding the biochemical pathways of cellular response to
<br>
stress or injury may lead to an alternative and inexpensive treatment to
<br>
efficiently manage restenosis in humans. The discovery is the result of
<br>
approximately fifteen years of basic scientific research. The researchers
<br>
found that an easily obtained chemical reagent made a direct and simple
<br>
clinical application suddenly available. The drug TTM is already in use
<br>
for the treatment of another human disease and, interestingly, has very
<br>
few and readily reversible side effects.
