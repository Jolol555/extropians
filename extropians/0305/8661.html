I would like to see more emphasis on the psychological, especially the 
<br>
notion of 'props', things which hold us up psychologically. For 
<br>
instance, I'm overweight and plain looking, but also (modestly speaking) 
<br>
supposedly possessed of genius-level IQ, so my pride in my own 
<br>
intelligence is (to me), a 'prop' which lets me believe I'm superior to 
<br>
most people. (It wasn't till I started working with computers that I had 
<br>
people around me who I didn't think were friggin' idiots).
<br>
<p>Picture Joe Sixpack though, working in some factory somewhere, and he 
<br>
has to call his boss 'sir'. On TV he sees reporters asking the president 
<br>
questions, and the reporters are far from deferential. Sometimes (though 
<br>
not much of late) they seem downright hostile.
<br>
<p>For example, a reporter might say 'Isn't this tax cut a blatant gift to 
<br>
the wealthiest Americans?' instead of something like 'Oh! Dear 
<br>
President, we of limited insight and intelligence fail to grasp the 
<br>
extraordinary genius of your tax cut plan. If you could, might you 
<br>
explain the job-creation aspects again in terms comprehensible to our 
<br>
shallow, limited minds?'.
<br>
<p>Joe Sixpack sees this and thinks the reporters are some sort of weird 
<br>
offshoot of humanity. Sure 'nuff, they're _liberals_. Well, by God, this 
<br>
president is one guy I can stand behind, and if he says Osama bin 
<br>
Hussein of Iraq has WMD ready to launch any minute now against the US 
<br>
then it must be true.
