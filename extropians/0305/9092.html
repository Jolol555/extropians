This is synaptogenesis. We don't make many new neurons after childhood

neurons and the number of receptors for neuro and other chemicals.

Specific genes are activated to achieve LTP (long term potentiation). 
<br>
LTP is involved in several kinds of memory formation.

<p><em>&gt; Genes don't *directly* make anything

</em><br>

Spot on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Already memor*ized* information is unlikely to require the same sort

</em><br>

</em><br>
Every time you recall a memory, you have to produce certain proteins in 
<br>
order to keep it in long term storage afterwards. If I inject you with a 
<br>
glutamate blocker right after you finish reading this, you won't be able 
<br>
to remember this email. If you go out somewhere new, you'll have 
<br>
difficulty navigating the same route tomorrow because you won't remember it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though, there is some level of maintenance activity required for us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;retain the connections (memories) that are in place as the protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical constructs would certainly degrade over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Only if the synapses decrease in number. This can only happen if they're 
<br>
not used, (you might say, 'charged' regularly, or if they're interfered 
<br>
with by, for example, glutamate blockers. The lifespan of a long term 
<br>
memory is dependent on its synaptic connections. The number of these we 
<br>
make depends on the weighting of the sensory input by emotion and 
<br>
imagination.) But any memory is updated and changed according to your 
<br>
current beliefs, ideas and motivations every time you recall and resave 
<br>
it (You cannot recall without a resave).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps accessing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a memory is stimulation enough to cause some sort of minor maintenance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or reinforcement construction to be done with expressed proteins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yes it is. Both a pre- and a post-synaptic cell must be firing to be 
<br>
'important' enough to make a long term memory. There's lots more, but 
<br>
I'll leave it at that for risk of getting boring.
