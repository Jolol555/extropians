Technology Review: TextAloud MP3
<br>
Rachel Quist
<br>
If you are like me, you have a long list of unread journal articles and despite
<br>
the best of intentions the list is not getting any smaller. So, when I read
<br>
about a new program, TextAloud MP3, that will transform written text into an MP3
<br>
spoken word file, I was intrigued and envisioned myself listening to a “journal
<br>
article on CD” during my commute. I gave it a try and here are the results.
<br>
TextAloud MP3 is small computer program available to Microsoft Windows users
<br>
that transforms text into spoken words. A document must be in the form of text
<br>
file (*.txt) or a small document can be copied and pasted into the program
<br>
itself.
<br>
The document can be listened to immediately or saved as a MP3 or WAV file.
<br>
TextAloud MP3 cannot convert MP3 files to an audio file readable by a typical
<br>
CD player but other readily available programs, such as Musicmatch Jukebox
<br>
(musicmatch.com), contain that capability.
<br>
In my experience, one of the most difficult tasks was obtaining a journal
<br>
article in a text format. There are plenty of articles available in an Adobe
<br>
Acrobat format (*.pdf) but it is a cumbersome process to convert those files
<br>
into text files, especially if photographs and extensive formatting exist.
<br>
Once that issue is solved then it only takes a few minutes to convert several
<br>
pages of text into an audio file. TextAloud MP3 uses the Microsoft computer
<br>
voices- Sam is the male voice and Mary is the female voice. An upgrade to more
<br>
natural sounding voices is also available for an extra charge. Overall,
<br>
TextAloud MP3 worked well and exactly as it was intended to. Some minor issues
<br>
I encountered included difficulty with acronyms and the lack of appropriate
<br>
pauses. TextAloud MP3 will only properly speak an acronym if it is in the
<br>
format “U P A C” rather than “UPAC” or “U.P.A.C.” Running a simple find and
<br>
replace function prior to running the text to speak program can easily solve
<br>
this problem. TextAloud MP3 also had difficulty pausing at appropriate
<br>
intervals. This problem can be solved by placing several empty lines of text
<br>
where appropriate pauses should exist, such as after the title or at the end
<br>
of a chapter. In summary, this technology is promising but the program did not
<br>
work as well as I had hoped for my intended purpose. Larger documents required
<br>
preliminary preparation and the lack of human voice inflections became somewhat
<br>
tedious. However, the program worked exactly as advertised by NextUp.com and
<br>
it was easy to download, install, and use. Best of all, I did not experience
<br>
any software conflicts or system crashes.
