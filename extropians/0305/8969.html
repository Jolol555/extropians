<p>My sarcasm was insufficently pointed. Very well. Substitute &quot;Where did 
<br>
*they* get it?&lt;see PS&gt;&quot; and the point remains. The &quot;strong culture&quot; of 
<br>
Ba'ath oppression was well in place in 1991. They were the ones with the 
<br>
guns, and the torture chambers, and they methodically took apart resistance 
<br>
for many years. After decades of oppression, and an effective purge of the 
<br>
&quot;tall poppies&quot; in 1991, you seem to be surprised that the populus of Iraq 
<br>
didn't turn on a dime this Spring.
<br>
<p>Could it just be that they thought it was too risky, and were biding their 
<br>
time, waiting for the dust to settle? Is this somehow remarkable?
<br>
<p>I notice you didn't respond to any other part of my post. *Shrug*. Our 
<br>
mutual loss.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p>PS: most of the press that I've seen that uses that expression has an axe 
<br>
to grind in a stereotypical direction: anti-&quot;cold dead hands&quot;, anti-Heston, 
<br>
etc. -- in effect, &quot;pro-nobody-needs-guns-and-people-who-talk-as-if-they- 
<br>
did-are-scary&quot;.
<br>
<p>Have you considered the possbility that the expression betrays a bias? It 
<br>
seems like code to me.
