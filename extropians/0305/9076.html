<p><em>&gt; &gt; ### But isn't it the same as the totalist position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The totalist position says it is better to copy than to move.
</em><br>
<p>Whereas I think that maybe we discussed this before, I still
<br>
cannot understand why you would rather move than copy.  In
<br>
order to perhaps gain some insight, let me formulate a thought
<br>
experiment to find out your feelings on the matter.
<br>
<p>Suppose that on one bright and cheery morning, Eliezer is having
<br>
an extremely good time.  This is mainly (let us say) due to
<br>
a commendable excess of serotonin operating in his CNS, but
<br>
may also be due to having had a number of good breaks lately.
<br>
Let us further suppose that there are two delightful problems
<br>
to work on, A and B, both of which promise nice advances in
<br>
the theory of AI friendliness.
<br>
<p>Now Eliezer finds that A is slightly more fun and perhaps 
<br>
slightly more promising than B, but so delightful and promising
<br>
are both choices that he hesitates in choosing.  Now to work
<br>
on A, however, involves going to another office in another 
<br>
building.
<br>
<p>Are we to assume that you would copy---instead of move---but
<br>
do so only because you are making a sacrifice for the sake of
<br>
humanity?  Namely, by getting to work on both A and B, you 
<br>
of course advance the cause of the Singularity (thus alleviating
<br>
much pain and suffering in the world), but at some cost to 
<br>
yourself.  The cost to yourself---if I have understood you
<br>
correctly---is that it would be better for you to have moved
<br>
rather than copied.
<br>
<p>To place myself in a parallel situation, suppose that Lee has
<br>
two hours free at some particular time T in which to watch a
<br>
great movie.  Even better, there are two movies A and B that
<br>
would be almost equally pleasurable to watch.  Well, what I
<br>
would do, of course, (being a totalist) is make a copy of 
<br>
myself for the interval of time (T, T+2hrs) and watch both
<br>
movies.  (We are not talking about any events subsequent to
<br>
T+2hrs, and I hope that no one is distracted by such considerations.)
<br>
Why shouldn't I get to watch both movies, and enjoy both, and
<br>
why isn't this the best course of action for one?
<br>
<p>Lee
