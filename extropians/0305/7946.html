<p>Faster Than the Speed of Light:
<br>
The Story of a Scientific Speculation

George Ellis
<br>
<p>João Magueijo is one of many who hope to see the epitaph 'Einstein
<br>
was wrong, I was right' on their gravestone. He is a cosmologist
<br>
who, one rainy morning in Cambridge, suddenly saw the possibility of
<br>
a varying speed of light (VSL) as an alternative to the
<br>
inflationary-theory paradigm that dominates present-day theoretical
<br>
cosmology. He knew from the start that it represented a fundamental
<br>
challenge to physics orthodoxy (it violates the foundations of
<br>
Einstein's special theory of relativity) and would not easily be
<br>
accepted, but he worked enthusiastically to develop the idea. He
<br>
found a collaborator who wavered but eventually completed a joint
<br>
paper with him on the topic. This was rejected by major journals but
<br>
was eventually accepted for publication after a long battle. He then
<br>
discovered that the idea had already been proposed, in a slightly
<br>
different form, by John Moffat. He found new collaborators and with
<br>
them developed variants of his theory.
<br>
<p>Faster Than the Speed of Light is a lively book that captures the
<br>
excitement and frustrations of doing real-world science. Magueijo
<br>
relates interestingly how his VSL proposal might possibly be a way
<br>
out of some major puzzles facing cosmology, which he explains well.
<br>
There are irritating passages, however, where he makes extended use
<br>
of a metaphor involving farmers and cows in explaining relativity
<br>
theory. Magueijo states that this is based on a dream that Einstein
<br>
had as a boy - a fictional invention that displays such a cavalier
<br>
attitude to historical truth as to call into question his other
<br>
historical claims (and for the record, it was Richard Tolman, not
<br>
Yakov Zeldovich, who first investigated the thermodynamics of
<br>
bouncing universes). And at times Magueijo descends to an altogether
<br>
different space characterized by hostile ranting (&quot;seem to fancy
<br>
themselves as scientific pimps&quot;) and crude language. In these
<br>
passages he expresses his profound dissatisfaction with how he has
<br>
been treated by the scientific world despite the recognition and
<br>
generous support he has received (he was awarded a Cambridge
<br>
fellowship and a Royal Society research fellowship, and is a reader
<br>
at Imperial College, London).
<br>
<p>His papers on VSL have now been widely read and referred to. Why,
<br>
then, his major discontent? He has had no more difficulty than many
<br>
others who have presented challenges to orthodoxy. All major new
<br>
ideas have been resisted in their time: the expanding Universe,
<br>
continental drift, special relativity and quantum theory, for
<br>
example. Science is inherently conservative - it has to be so, given
<br>
the flood of speculative writing. It also has to be open, allowing
<br>
dissemination of unorthodox views, which does occur. It is resistive
<br>
but not impermeable, as is shown in his own case. There is a valid
<br>
complaint, nevertheless: the current use of refereeing as a defence
<br>
of the inflationary-theory orthodoxy in cosmology is indeed
<br>
regrettable.
<br>
<p>Magueijo's dissatisfaction is wider than that, however. He
<br>
criticizes all university administration as parasitic and
<br>
unnecessary, throwing in gratuitous insults as he does so. He is
<br>
breathtakingly arrogant as regards funding - he seems to assume it
<br>
is his right to be funded for the work he is doing with no questions
<br>
asked. He gives no attention to the methods by which one can decide
<br>
how public funding should be dispensed in science, nor to why the
<br>
public should pay any money at all to people like him. Yes, there
<br>
are problems in university organization and the funding system;
<br>
constructive criticism is justifiable and indeed needed. But his
<br>
remarks are purely destructive.
<br>
<p>What of the VSL theory itself? Is it the panacea he hopes for? No,
<br>
it is not. Einstein reflected deeply on the foundations of physics,
<br>
and that was the basis of his success. Magueijo has not gone back to
<br>
the foundations and sorted them out. Any theory of this kind needs,
<br>
first, a viable proposal for measuring both time and distance, as
<br>
velocity is based on this; second, a physical model that embodies
<br>
the results of these measurements in some well-defined mathematical
<br>
structure; and third, a theory of electromagnetism that predicts the
<br>
speed of light in relation to these measurement processes. He has
<br>
none of these, and without them he does not have the basis to put
<br>
his theory on a solid foundation.
<br>
<p>Standard relativity theory deals with all these issues in depth. The
<br>
key point is that current ways of measuring distance precisely
<br>
incorporate the speed of light in their foundations. On large
<br>
scales, radar (with its variants such as the Global Positioning
<br>
System) is the only viable method. It is then not possible for the
<br>
speed of light to vary, because it is the very basis of measuring
<br>
distance; as emphasized by J. L. Synge, the natural units for
<br>
distance are light seconds or light years, rather than metres or
<br>
miles. Furthermore, this is then built into the foundations of the
<br>
theory through the space-time metric tensor and its interpretation
<br>
as determining proper time (time measured by an ideal clock along
<br>
its worldline), proper distance (measured by radar), and the null
<br>
cone (characterizing the path of light through space-time). Because
<br>
Magueijo and Moffat ignore this physical interpretation of the
<br>
metric, their so-called 'phase transition in the speed of light' is
<br>
just a jump in arbitrary units for time, unrelated to measurement
<br>
procedures. It is not a physical prediction.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the variation principles proposed as underlying the
<br>
physics involve the metric tensor in raising and lowering indices to
<br>
create scalars - and hence build into the foundations of the theory
<br>
the invariance of the speed of light (the metric determines the
<br>
speed of wave propagation). We are given no reason why any broken
<br>
symmetries associated with special solutions of the resulting
<br>
equations will give a causal explanation for a varying speed of
<br>
light - but this variation is the arbitrary postulate of VSL theory.
<br>
And apart from the part of the action determining variation of the
<br>
speed of light (independently of Maxwell's equations), the explicit
<br>
occurrence of the speed of light in the VSL variational principle
<br>
proposed is only in a ratio with the gravitational constant G- so
<br>
this is just a varying-Gtheory in disguise.
<br>
<p>Developments that could make VSL viable, such as further
<br>
investigation of the time variation of the fine-structure constant,
<br>
of two-metric theories, of an altered version of the symmetry group
<br>
underlying relativity theory, or through a string-theory motivation
<br>
for varying 'constants', need to provide a clear relation to space
<br>
and time measurement, as well as a physical reason (based in some
<br>
version of Maxwell's equations) for the speed of light to vary. It
<br>
is a pity that Magueijo does not mention progress made in these
<br>
directions by workers other than himself and his own collaborators.
