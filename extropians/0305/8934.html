<em>&gt; The online version of Wired from May (Issue 11.05) has

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Speak for yourself!  Several of my space activist friends and I have
<br>
been following the Chinese and Indian space programs closely -- as
<br>
closely as we can when the former is quite tight-lipped.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand maybe that isn't so bad.  E.g. Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to be *really* annoyed if the flag at Tranquillity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Base gets folded up -- perhaps that would provoke us into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting serious about going into space).
</em><br>
<p>This has actually been the conclusion of several friends and me.  While
<br>
I'm against all government supported anything, it's good to see a little
<br>
competition.  I'd rather, all other things being equal, see more nations
<br>
in space than less -- though I'd much prefer all the efforts to be
<br>
privatized.  (This has worked well in the American satelite launch
<br>
industry.)
<br>
<p>Of course, it remains to be seen if both China and India, despite all
<br>
their talk, can deliver.  China is slated to launch a man into space
<br>
later this year.  India is not yet at the stage where it can support
<br>
manned spaceflight.  However, this is all old tech -- 1960s -- but
<br>
having the skills, both organizational and technological, is not easy.
<br>
<p>Later!
<br>
<p>Dan
