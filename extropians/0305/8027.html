proportion to anything I have ever done or said or believed.
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what you wrote clearly was disappointed that the media 
<br>
allegedly (by you) was totally under the thumb of the Army and had not 
<br>
reported the war honestly.  To conclude that you were not on the side of the 
<br>
American Army was not unreasonable.  However you have said since that you 
<br>
were not disappointed that the Army did not suffer some tragedy.  Your word 
<br>
is good enough.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, how you can conclude that the Army as an organization 
<br>
dominated the media is beyond me.  We have evidence from the testimony of the 
<br>
direct media involved that some of them were shilling for Sadaam.  If we 
<br>
watched the nightly news casts we know the media repeatedly forecast doom and 
<br>
gloom.  We also know that the forecasts didn't even come close to reality.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know from the reports that such glowing reports on our Army as 
<br>
existed -- and there were some -- resulted from the attitude of the embedded 
<br>
reporters toward the men and women they served among.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, surprise, surprise.  We have known that is a natural reaction 
<br>
for generations.  After Vietnam it was reported that the Army wanted to know 
<br>
what motivated men to go through the hell of combat instead of running like 
<br>
crazy.  They hired some very powerful psychologists to find the answer.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that when men serve together they become friends.  The 
<br>
ages and ages of human evolution have hard wired men so they will risk death 
<br>
rather than see their friends killed.  Those reporters were human and they 
<br>
responded to the same process.
<br>
