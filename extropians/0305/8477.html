<em>&gt; &gt; It was a rhetorical question, Karen, to illustrate what I expect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become a new insanity defense. Since sociopaths are already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recognised as not regarding their victims as people, this treads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on well established areas of insanity defense case law. Whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is any distiction between your three different analyses, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and which one is accurate, apparently will be put to various 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; juries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ^^^^^^^^^ Usually I find people who answer rhetorical questions to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annoying. In spite of that, I thought real discussion of the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this question might be interesting.  Your question caught my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention mainly because I did not know what you meant by a &quot;new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of insanity defense&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, while many suicides and murders have been blamed by their
<br>
perpetrators and families of victims on certain rock music, I am not
<br>
aware of any violent crimes blamed on a particular movie.
<br>
<p>The Matrix, with its extremely amazing special effects in a virtual
<br>
reality, lends the suggestible to belief in the basic idea behind the
<br>
movie: that we live in a simulation. Other movies have examined this
<br>
thesis as well: Existenz and The 13th Floor, among others. They have
<br>
also treated, to one extent or another, the question of whether
<br>
violence in a simulation is really violence, whether murdering a
<br>
character in a simulation is really murder. 
<br>
<p>As our technology advances more and more, virtual realities will
<br>
achieve ever greater levels of reality. Being able to distinguish
<br>
between reality and virtuality will become a significant social
<br>
problem, with the most extreme example being violent crime perpetrated
<br>
by individuals who sincerely beleive they are acting within a
<br>
simulation and not within reality. I would call this Virtuality
<br>
Syndrome: the belief that one is living within a simulated universe,
<br>
accompanied by dissociative disorders like sociopathy and
<br>
schizophrenia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am only a law student, and criminal law will definitely not be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area I enter into; however, neither the news article nor your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question seem to add anything new to formulations of the insanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense to criminal prosecution. I gather from your posts that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while you are very interested in some areas of law, you are not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attorney.  I also sense from this post that you are disturbed by a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived trend in criminal law to expand the insanity defense. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also sense that you find people who answer rhetorical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions to be annoying. (So if you didn't really want an answer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel free to ignore my response!) ;)
</em><br>
<p>Always interested in your response, Karen. You are consistently an
<br>
intelligent poster. No, I'm not a lawyer, though I have taken a number
<br>
of law classes and study it informally in my interest in 2nd amendment
<br>
issues. I have never stayed at a Holiday Inn Express, though... ;)
<br>
<p>What concerns me is whether this will be accepted as an excuse or not,
<br>
and what the results will be. For example, if Virtuality Syndrome
<br>
becomes as serious a problem as I think it will, there may be
<br>
significant legislative efforts to prevent AIs from existing within
<br>
simulated realities, to restrict the amount of intelligence that can be
<br>
programmed into simulation characters, and also to make combat or
<br>
street crime simulation games illegal or restricted to adult use only,
<br>
including restrictions on anyone taking drugs for mental disorders from
<br>
using them.
<br>
<p>If we do, in fact, live within a simulation, as some like Nick Bostrom
<br>
have posited, then we must also form a moral imperative to respect the
<br>
rights of intelligent life in other simulated realities.
