</em><br>
<p>I meant the next Extro as a *particular* conference/meeting place
<br>
not as the set of memes that extropes and transhumanists propagate.
<br>
<p>I think a physical attack on an ExI meet from people holding
<br>
conflicting views is anticipating a level of political relevance (and
<br>
targetability) that is a problem most transhumanist organisations are
<br>
still working towards.
<br>
<p>Unfortuately (imo) the &quot;entropic vectors&quot; as opposed to the extropic
<br>
ones seem to have gained political impetus in the last year or so. I
<br>
think the tech progress is still happening (fortunately) but on the
<br>
political front it seems to me some substantial hits have been taken.
<br>
(ie. in stem cells, in gene therapy, extended FDA jurisdiction, the
<br>
emergence of a niche of what for lack of a better phrase I'll call the
<br>
dying-with-grace-to-make-room-for-the-next-generation-movement,
<br>
&quot;bioethicists&quot; and social commentators with little to say but peddling
<br>
the easy message of fear, uncertainty and doubt seem to be becoming
<br>
a new industry. Cryonics seems to have had a bad year PR wise). This
<br>
*could* be all just be a personal view and distorted (others located
<br>
elsewhere may be seeing things differently). Meanwhile international law
<br>
(for whatever its was worth and I know that there are a variety of views
<br>
of that on this list) and law *isn't* morality, seems to have taken a pretty
<br>
straight hit this year too. Unfortunately 2002/2003 looks to me
<br>
somewhat more like a win for the &quot;forces of entropy&quot; than &quot;extropy&quot;.
<br>
<p>I am sure that some parts of the human pool (including some Iraqi
<br>
citizens do see things quite differently.).
<br>
<p>(Anyone) please insert counter arguments (wins for extropy over
<br>
entropy here) where they will be read with real appreciation and
<br>
relish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think I accept the theses that in order for an intelligent desperate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person to cause havoc (terrorists, or perhaps a better example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Timothy McVeigh) all the is necessary is that they be willing to give
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No!  That is one of the key points to understand about technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming smaller, cheaper and more available.
</em><br>
<p>Your right. I was off point (or making another point). Technology
<br>
does changes the risk calculation in that for some particular knowledge
<br>
enabled individuals they may well be able to launch attacks remotely
<br>
and with relatively (compared to McVeigh) less chance of being caught
<br>
or of having to die for &quot;their cause&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;.. One of the important things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to recognize about bioterrorism is that one can personally have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long since departed the scene when people start dropping like flies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Fortunately probably more people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capable of acquiring the destructive knowledge base but far fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will adopt the perspective that their own lives are so worth the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of making their point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One should remember that soviet workers in the bioarms industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were generally vaccinated against the weapons they were working on.
</em><br>
<p>I think the soviets in the cold war area had some political
<br>
sophistications that terrorists organisations like al quida don't need to
<br>
bother with. Vaccination programs still require some sort of scale
<br>
(though I can see that this will be reduced). They also presuppose a
<br>
value being placed on the &quot;deliverymen&quot; that I think many modern
<br>
terror groups might not need to bother with.
<br>
<p>If I was to try and wage a terror war on the US I wouldn't worry too
<br>
much about the biotech deliverymen. I reckon US foreign policy is
<br>
making these a commodity resource. (Though I did read today that
<br>
actual deaths from &quot;terrorist attacks&quot; are down this year compared to
<br>
last&quot;).
<br>
<p>It makes sense to decouple delivery from manufacture. Its logistically
<br>
neater. I reckon the bin ladens are more than willing to sacrifice a few
<br>
&quot;pawns&quot;. The &quot;pawns&quot; are so numerous and have so little to loose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Oklahoma bombings&quot; as incidents are one thing, are we going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see them as a sort of syndrome? What if anything is the defence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know -- there seem to be two very different hazards.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The first is where an individual wants to make a statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about their hatred or political philosophy (the suicide bombings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Mid-East) come to mind.
</em><br>
<p>It is about hatred on one level but I'd try and see it as political
<br>
philosophy because that's how I imagine they'd see it. Calling it hatred
<br>
just whacks a crude label on the problem and doesn't come to grips
<br>
with it or facilitate the search for solutions. Not that these solutions are
<br>
likely to be easy to find.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The second is where an individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to simply eliminate persons, a group, a nationality, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second group would have to do nothing more than infect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conference room the night before an Extro Conf. or get a job
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparing the food for a Conf. diner, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. But again I reckon the likely targets are President Bush,
<br>
and Prime Ministers Blair and Howard with these sorts of attacks.
<br>
I imagine the Rumsfelds and co have given some sort of increased
<br>
attention to the possibility of bio-attacks but the technology and
<br>
the availability to produce new bioweapons probably means they'd
<br>
be vulnerable around now.
<br>
<p>I reckon were going to see a further development of the IRA cell
<br>
style form of terrorist with decoupled weapons (including bioweapons
<br>
manufacturing and delivery systems (martyrs) so that the US supremacy
<br>
in military force is mitigated and the premium on smart and expensive
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; will go up. Sadly this is not likely to auger well for civil
<br>
libs, or ultimately I suspect commerce.
