Researchers discover common cause for aging and age-related disease
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-05/uoc--rdc051303.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-05/uoc--rdc051303.php</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Why do serious diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and Huntington's mainly
<br>
hit us in middle age or later? The links between aging and age-related
<br>
diseases have proved elusive.
<br>
<p>In studies of the powerfully informative roundworm, C. elegans, UCSF
<br>
scientists have discovered that a class of molecules found in the worms and
<br>
in people can both prolong life in the worm and prevent the harmful
<br>
accumulation of abnormal proteins that cause a debilitating
<br>
Huntington's-like disease. The finding appears to be the first evidence in
<br>
an animal of a link between aging and age-related disease.
<br>
<p>The molecules, called &quot;small heat-shock proteins,&quot; are known to assemble
<br>
into complexes that bind to damaged or unfolded cellular proteins and
<br>
prevent them from forming into harmful aggregations. &quot;
<br>
<p>etc..
<br>
<p>.......

<p>Regulation of Aging and Age-Related Disease by DAF-16 and Heat-Shock Factor
<br>
Ao-Lin Hsu, Coleen T. Murphy, Cynthia Kenyon*
<br>
<p>The Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor HSF-1, which regulates the
<br>
heat-shock response, also influences aging. Reducing hsf-1 activity
<br>
accelerates tissue aging and shortens life-span, and we show that hsf-1
<br>
overexpression extends lifespan. We find that HSF-1, like the transcription
<br>
factor DAF-16, is required for daf-2-insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutations to
<br>
extend life-span. Our findings suggest this is because HSF-1 and DAF-16
<br>
together activate expression of specific genes, including genes encoding
<br>
small heat-shock proteins, which in turn promote longevity. The small
<br>
heat-shock proteins also delay the onset of polyglutamine-expansion protein
<br>
aggregation, suggesting that these proteins couple the normal aging process
<br>
to this type of age-related disease.
