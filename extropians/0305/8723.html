<em>&gt; I hereby declare Global Warming to be a dead issue. See the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/climate-03q.html">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/climate-03q.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this is a mixed bag.  They actually confirmed global warming and
<br>
conceded that it was probably caused by humans, and then calculated that it
<br>
was occurring at a slower rate than previously thought.  Pro-global-warmists
<br>
will hype this as confirmation of their theory, while anti-global-warmists
<br>
will hype this as refutation of their theory.  In reality, it is a mixture
<br>
of both, with the truth somewhere in-between.
<br>
<p>They estimated a &quot;95%&quot; confidence in satellite data.  I am sure more studies
<br>
will be done to increase that confidence.  The also gave the rate of
<br>
increase per century as a single number as if it were linear.  I would like
<br>
to see graphs to see if it is steady of if it is increasing.  The actual
<br>
rate turns out to be one and a quarter degrees Fahrenheit each century.  But
<br>
since the satellites only measured two decades, it is still hard to predict
<br>
whether this trend will continue into future centuries.  I don't think the
<br>
question of global warming in the future is settled yet, but the immediate
<br>
emergency seems to have been substantially delayed.
<br>
<p>I actually hope that global warming is caused by humans, because that puts
<br>
it under our control.  If the cause is &quot;probably caused by humans&quot; as this
<br>
study says, it might increase as technology and population increases.  Or it
<br>
might go away as we miniaturize technology and become more energy efficient.
<br>
Or it might be solved by technology with air scrubbers or energy pumps that
<br>
get energy by taking heat out of the atmosphere
<br>
<p>The actual data trend graph and interactive global map of temperatures over
<br>
time as recorded by these satellites can be viewed at
