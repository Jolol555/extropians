<p>Who is afraid of admitting that we don't know everything? Who are you

talking about?

<p><em>&gt; SARS is new.  We don't know if it will spread or die out.  We

</em><br>
<p>Maybe the evidence is not yet conclusive, but there is plenty of evidence.
<br>
It's clear at this point that a moderately well developed public health
<br>
system like Canada's or Vietnam's can contain SARS with a pretty good
<br>
margin of safety. On the other hand we also know that it can be
<br>
transmitted easily when public health measures are lacking and will kill
<br>
15-20% of people that it infects.
<br>
<p>Those of us who are directly or indirectly affected by SARS (I personally
<br>
have relatives in Beijing) have to make decisions based on how serious we
<br>
think it is. Unlike you, we can't just say &quot;I don't know what's going to
<br>
happen, there's no evidence either way.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Worse, each side attacks the other as being fear-mongerers or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth-suppressors.  Why the vitriol? 
</em><br>
<p>What vitriol? What are you talking about?
