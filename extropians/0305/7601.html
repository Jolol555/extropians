<em>&gt; I will give you some of that. To me, it simply is an interesting puff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece regarding some potentially health-increasing hypotheses. It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough points to get me to consider the idea that the saturated fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogma may be incorrect, but it certainly doesn't prove anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for certain.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for this much of an admission.  Maybe I expected this to be more
<br>
rigorous than it really was.  In my own research (years ago), I focused on
<br>
experimental results only.  I would directly seen the experiments, the
<br>
controls, and the results.  I could draw my own conclusions, or see where a
<br>
later discovered fallacy was present.  In these kinds of papers, there is
<br>
not enough direct evidence or clear step-by-step logic to prove anything.
<br>
This paper doesn't convince me, but I can't prove it is wrong either.
<br>
<p>Despite my being unconvinced that eating a lot of saturated fat is either
<br>
good for me or actually required for my health, these discussions have
<br>
definitely been an eye-opener for me.  I had no idea that people were
<br>
actually advocating this type of thing.
<br>
<p>It very well could be that we discover that saturated fats aren't as bad for
<br>
us as we think.  I know it was an obvious conclusion to discover cholesterol
<br>
in arterial plaques, and assume that we should limit that stuff as much as
<br>
possible.  Then we discovered that the body made its own cholesterol, and
<br>
dietary cholesterol was not a big contributor.  Then we discovered that
<br>
cholesterol buildup did not occur randomly in the presence of cholesterol,
<br>
but needed arterial inflammation to build on.  Now, we are not sure how
<br>
important cholesterol lowering is, but are focused more on preventing
<br>
inflammation and plaques.  Our nutritional knowledge certainly grows as we
<br>
learn more.  It may very well be possible that saturated fats are OK.
<br>
<p>But there still seems to be a lot of evidence that high-saturated-fat diets
<br>
causes heart disease in animals.  Maybe the truth is more complicated than
<br>
that, but I certainly don't feel comfortable recommending that people eat
<br>
more saturated fat.  At this point, a quick search of medical references and
<br>
experimental studies still seems to show that the consensus is that
<br>
saturated fats are not required and seem to cause negative side-effects.
<br>
Unsaturated fats are required and seem to cause good side-effects.  So for
<br>
now, I think the evidence still leans toward the monosaturated fats &gt;
<br>
polyunsaturated fats &gt; saturated fats &gt; hydrogenated fats in order of
<br>
preference.
