</em><br>
<em>&gt;Me too! There's clearly an interest in/demand for this but it doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happen. I think the problem in part is the lack of a vocabulary or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discourse for discussion of such matters. The only kind of language that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems to be widely used now is the apocalyptic one, according to which the

<p>Time for a memetic tune-up!

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; At ExI, we are working on a &quot;Worlds Smallest Futurist Quiz, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm working on a version for my talk at the TransVision
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Conference.  For this, I was planning on solicitating Ander's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; keen mind :-)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I would be delighted! After all, there are different kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;futures and futurists too. However, that sounds somewhat different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;from the inherently political quiz I suggested in this thread.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Maybe that's a misleading distinction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;I'm not sure just how to does this for a futurists' quiz, but at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;least I've got the first 2 questions.  The night before last, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;mother, Max and I tossed around a few ideas and this was provoking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;because of the differences between an 85 year old and baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;boomers.  We focused on biotechnological questions and my mother
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;proved to be extropic in her thinking here.  But not everywhere!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;I think that to design a balanced quiz, it would require either a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;person who is very sharp or a team of people from diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;backgrounds to test the questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I think we need to think about what the quiz should reveal or be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;used for. One approach is to show the assumptions about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;speed/size of future changes and one's valence to it (e.g. Bill Joy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is close to our idea of the size and speed, but not that it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;good thing, while many conservative thinkers are negative but do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not believe any real change is on the horizon). Another approach is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to look at how radical changes are conceivable within different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;areas, and how well these can be integrated into coherent world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;models of the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I think this is very important. It's amazing how little work has actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;been done on how people generally conceive of change, the future, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;their place in it.
</em><br>
<p>I hope you can help us out Steve.
<br>
<p>Best,
