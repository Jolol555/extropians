<p>Yep.  Also, most of these rocks would be hit/pushed where it makes the
<br>
biggest impact: at apohelion (for the ones with noncircular orbits,
<br>
which means all of them, IIRC:).
<br>
<p>The big problem is not so much getting the right amount of energy to the
<br>
right spot -- a nuke would do fine in most cases -- but being able to
<br>
finely control the outcome.  This requires more knowledge of asteroid
<br>
composition, shape, and structure.  For example, if the asteroid in
<br>
question is more like a floating dirt pile, then it might harder to
<br>
manuever since it might break up under manipulation with most of the
<br>
fragments still heading where you don't want them -- even worse, the
<br>
fragments might be distributed over a larger range of impact sites.  It
<br>
won't be like in that asteroid movie -- two chunks, but many thousands
<br>
of chunks, many of which might survive atmospheric entry or sweep Near
<br>
Earth Space of all spacecraft.
<br>
<p>To learn about asteroid composition and structure, perhaps the current
<br>
best way is to do more flybys, orbits, and landings -- many more, since
<br>
asteroids probably vary a lot.  (Earthbound observations have certainly
<br>
led to a range of classifications that indicate differences in
<br>
composition and perhaps structure.)  Such missions need not be high
<br>
cost, especially if we can get the SpaceWatch crowd to join efforts with
<br>
the would be asteroid mining people.  They seem like natural allies, yet
<br>
I don't see them even talking to each other.  (Sadly, inside space
<br>
activism circles, this sort of isolation between groups is typical.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
