Mike Lorrey:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, the precedent set by the gay community in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposing HIV containment remedies in favor of individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights has caused a massive resurgence in other communicable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diseases like TB, Syphillis, Gonorrhea, etc and hampered the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability of health care workers to nip epidemics in the bud. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ability of the US health care system to deal with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bioterror attacks is similarly compromised as a result.
</em><br>
<p>Opposing government interference in favor of individual rights is just
<br>
as legitimate for homosexuals as it is for libertarians. A quarantine
<br>
doesn't just happen. It takes guns, and the threat of using them.    
<br>
<p>A relevant bit from <a href="http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm">http://cartome.org/reverse-panopticon.htm</a>. I expect
<br>
many homosexuals were quite familiar with the issues quoted below, as
<br>
Foucault himself was an outspoken homosexual.

<p>Keith
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>In a seminal and controversial work of the late 1970’s “Discipline &amp;
<br>
Punish: The Birth of the Prison”, the late French philosopher Michel
<br>
Foucault tracks the origins of modern institutions of discipline and
<br>
social control, like the prison, and in a much-debated chapter titled
<br>
“Panopticism” Foucault points out that by the late 17th century, efforts
<br>
to combat recurring outbreaks of the Plague --such as had savaged San
<br>
Gimignano and Europe in years following 1348 -- would eventually lead to
<br>
urban protocols and management technologies that unexpectedly provided a
<br>
structural and administrative prototype associated with the modern
<br>
surveillance state. Ironically, epidemiological controls would provide
<br>
the blueprint of what Foucault called: &quot;the utopia of the perfectly
<br>
governed city&quot;.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarize Foucault’s fascinating description of disciplinary
<br>
mechanisms applied to towns under threat of Plague pandemic --
<br>
quarantines that, it turns out, would eventually follow very precise
<br>
urbanistic, administrative and bureaucratic designs: 
<br>
<p>Documents of the era describe quarantined towns being divided into
<br>
distinct quarters, each quarter governed by a so-called intendant, each
<br>
infected street placed under the authority of a syndic, who would keep
<br>
it under constant surveillance. Each house would be locked from the
<br>
outside by the syndic, who then submitted house-keys to the intendant of
<br>
the quarter. Keys would be returned to owners only after the quarantine
<br>
was lifted. Only intendants, syndics and guards were permitted to move
<br>
about the streets and between infected houses, or from one corpse to
<br>
another. All inhabitants were obliged to appear at their windows daily
<br>
to be individually inspected and scrutinized in regard to their state of
<br>
health. Each individual’s status was documented by written registration
<br>
submitted by syndics to intendants, and then remitted to the central
<br>
authority, the magistrate. 
<br>
<p>Thus, Foucault describes how under threat of pandemic Death, we find
<br>
disciplinary machinery in which &quot;social space is observed at every
<br>
point... the slightest movement of individuals is supervised and
<br>
recorded...written documentation links the omnipresent and omniscient
<br>
hierarchic center with the quarantined periphery&quot;. To paraphrase
<br>
Foucault: during quarantines, the late 17th century inhabitant became
<br>
&quot;immobilized in a frozen kind of space... an environment in which
<br>
inspection functioned ceaselessly... and the authoritarian gaze was
<br>
alert everywhere&quot;. This, says Foucault, was the “political dream of the
<br>
plague”. This was “the utopia of the perfectly governed city”.
