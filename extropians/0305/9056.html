<p>Why grow whole organs?  Injecting a few stem cells into the offending organ
<br>
will start replacing non-functional organ cells with correctly functioning
<br>
ones.  Systems fail when too many of the cells in that system function
<br>
improperly due to entropy or genetic disorders.  Damage due to entropy could
<br>
be combatted by pure strands of a stem cell and localized injecitons.
<br>
Damage from genetic disorders could be reversed with geneticially modified
<br>
stem cells from the patients own genome.  Organs are collections of cells,
<br>
and organs function improperly when too many of the cells in that system
<br>
function improperly.  We can combat the tendance for cellular functions to
<br>
alter with stem cells.

<p>Cloned Stem Cells cure Parkinsons in rat model -
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/05/020510074808.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/05/020510074808.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Paul Carvey, PhD, chairman of pharmacology at Rush, used his team's
<br>
discovery to clone several generations of stem cells that, when grafted into
<br>
the brains of rats with a Parkinson's like disease, developed into healthy
<br>
dopamine neurons. This effectively cured the animals' severe Parkinsonian
<br>
symptoms&quot;
<br>
<p>Stem Cells reduce brain damage -
<br>
<a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/11.21/01-stem.html">http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/11.21/01-stem.html</a>
<br>
&quot;Snyder was surprised to see that stem cells not only replaced missing brain
<br>
tissue, but provided protection for cells disabled by age and diseases like
<br>
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. &quot;It's not unreasonable to think that in humans
<br>
the early implantation of stem cells - because of partnerships they form
<br>
with host cells - might forestall or even pre-empt degenerative diseases
<br>
such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,&quot; Snyder says.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;These demonstrations of neural stem cells' capacity to repair and protect a
<br>
brain leads Snyder to speculate that other types of stem cells could perform
<br>
the same functions in other organs, such as the heart, muscles, lungs, and
<br>
liver. &quot;Stem cells, in the broadest sense, are responsible for putting
<br>
organs together in the womb,&quot; he notes. &quot;They are a normal part of
<br>
development, so maybe we can find ways of fooling the injured or
<br>
dysfunctional body into believing that development is still going on.&quot;&quot;

<p>Transplant can cure diabetes -
<br>
<a href="http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/living/columnists/karen_garloch/46462">http://www.charlotte.com/mld/charlotte/living/columnists/karen_garloch/46462</a>

<br>
<p>Jody DeMarco came to Charlotte recently to give hope to those with juvenile
<br>
diabetes.
<br>
The 46-year-old Philadelphian is one of 140 people in the world whose
<br>
diabetes has been cured by a transplant of islet cells.Islet cells -- short
<br>
for islets of Langerhans -- are clusters of cells in the pancreas. They
<br>
contain beta cells, which secrete insulin needed to regulate the metabolism
<br>
of sugar. A malfunction of that process causes diabetes.  Two years ago,
<br>
Canadian researchers reported the first successful human transplants of
<br>
islet cells from donor cadavers. Today, eight centers in the United States,
<br>
Canada and Europe perform such transplants with funding from the JDRF&quot;
<br>
<p>[Here we see properly functioning cells, this time from a donor, injected
<br>
into a organ with cells that do not function properly, and the system they
<br>
support, in this case the generation of insulin, remains functional.  These
<br>
donor cells were taken from cadavers.  A better scenerio would be to use the
<br>
patients own stem cells.  Indeed the article later notes..]
<br>
<p>&quot;Therapeutic cloning of a person's own stem cells could produce sufficient
<br>
islet cells in the future, Gores said. By then, researchers may have figured
<br>
out how to stop the autoimmune problem that destroyed the person's islet
<br>
cells in the first place&quot;

repairs heart damage -

<br>
&quot;Heart. Several groups have been working on animal models in which
<br>
pluripotent stem cells are grafted into damaged hearts. The stem cells were
<br>
shown to incorporate into the heart and form gap junctions and beat with the
<br>
surrounding cells&quot;

<p>Turning Stem cells into Liver cells -
<br>
<a href="http://www.healthandage.org/Home/gm=20!gid1=3658">http://www.healthandage.org/Home/gm=20!gid1=3658</a>
<br>
&quot;The animals were injected with adult stem cells and the researchers found
<br>
that these could, indeed, become liver cells. But what was occurring was
<br>
cell fusion rather than cell transformation. A stem cell fused with a liver
<br>
cell, to make a new liver cell with extra numbers of chromosomes.&quot;
<br>
<p>etc. etc. etc....
