<em>&gt; Article excerpt:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Do dietary lectins cause disease?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The evidence is suggestive and raises interesting possibilities for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1988 a hospital launched a &quot;healthy eating day&quot; in its staff 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; canteen at lunchtime. One dish contained red kidney beans, and 31
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portions were served.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At 3 pm one of the customers, a surgical registrar, vomited in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theatre. Over the next four hours 10 more customers suffered profuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vomiting, some with diarrhoea.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a very misleading article. I thought everyone knew that kidney
<br>
beans need careful cooking. Somebody in this canteen made a big mistake.
<br>
<p>See <a href="http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/safereating/hiddendangers/">http://www.foodstandards.gov.uk/safereating/hiddendangers/</a>
<br>
<p>Quote:
<br>
Red kidney beans: Dried red kidney beans contain natural toxicants
<br>
called lectins, which can cause stomach-aches and vomiting. These are
<br>
completely destroyed if you soak the dried beans for at least 12 hours
<br>
and them boil them vigorously for least 10 minutes in fresh water.
<br>
Tinned kidney beans have already had this process applied and so can be
<br>
used without further treatment.
<br>
End quote.
<br>
<p>I do agree that this cooking might be a bit tricky for a caveman, but
<br>
we're not cavemen.
<br>
<p>Paleo people did have to worry about other food dangers mentioned on
<br>
this page, i.e.
<br>
<p>Apples
<br>
Mouldy or damaged apples may contain a mycotoxin called patulin,
<br>
particularly around the bruised or damaged part of the fruit.
<br>
<p>Shellfish
<br>
Toxicants formed by algae in the sea and fresh water are called algal
<br>
toxins and shellfish such as mussels, scallops and oysters are more
<br>
prone than other fish to algal contamination.
<br>
Any toxins in the algae ingested by the fish can accumulate in their
<br>
flesh and can reach levels that are dangerous to humans.
<br>
<p>Liver and Vitamin A
<br>
Vitamin A is essential in everyone's diet but if you're pregnant and you
<br>
consume excessive amounts, your developing foetus may be harmed.
<br>
<p>and, of course, meat that has 'gone off'. Did they have curry powder? :)
