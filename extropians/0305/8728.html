<p>It is one-sided for this one parameter. That is all I'm saying. As I wrote
<br>
in my last message, the parameters are debatable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember that over 40% of the participants were confirmed to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; following their diets. 
</em><br>
<p>That is indirect evidence for rather than against the statistical
<br>
differences found between the groups. The net effect of the cheaters in both
<br>
groups would have been a wash on the means of the parameters, but their
<br>
measurements would have increased the variances of the measurements, making
<br>
the differences seem less significant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As such, I believe the end-of-year measurements are not as reliable as the

earlier 
<br>

<em>&gt; 					Atkins:	Conventional Diet:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6 month triglycerides:	+15.0%	-7.6%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3 month LDL(bad) cholesterol:+5.4%	-7.4%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3 month total cholesterol:	 +1.7%	-5.4%
</em><br>
<p>The first comparison above is not statistically significant with p = .13
<br>
The second comparison above is not statistically significant with = .38
<br>
<p>The third comparison above is statistically significant at 3 months but
<br>
becomes insignificant at 6 and 12 months.

</em><br>
