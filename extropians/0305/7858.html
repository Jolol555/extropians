<p>Or he may be taking as already socially established the opinion about the 
<br>
moral undesirability of spitting on sidewalks, then drawing a conclusion 
<br>
about your personal character.  Or he may be using your spitting on the 
<br>
sidewalk, a voluntary behavior often viewed as a D play, as an indicator 
<br>
of your reputation.
<br>
<p>Perhaps, of course, you feel that the undesirability of spitting on 
<br>
sidewalks has not been established to your liking.  But it may have been 
<br>
established to his, and the audience's, liking.  After all you did not 
<br>
publish your argument for the social desirability of spitting on 
<br>
sidewalks; you actually spit on the sidewalk.
