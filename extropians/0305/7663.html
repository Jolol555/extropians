<em>&gt; I think this is one example of what Lee and Eliezer are pointing out. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colorectal cancer tends to be one of the diseases of old age and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet that helps to prevent it did not exist in paleolithic times. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paleo-diet is for young, very active humans, with no consideration for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the over 30s, because pretty much nobody lived over 30 then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if you aim to live life to the max and go out in a blaze of glory in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your 20s, then go for the paleo-diet. You know it makes sense - that's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they did for over a million years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think many people are at the Foresight thing, but I will give my take: 
<br>
these studies appear to confirm, rather than disconfirm the paleo diet. 
<br>
At least one of them also seems to rule out vegetarianism as an ideal diet.
<br>
<p>First, I looked at the actual web pages of the studies, and found no 
<br>
reference to the idea that they found fiber from grains/cereals to be 
<br>
superior to other types. Since they released so little data and findings 
<br>
publicly so far, they may indeed have drawbacks. In general, all I saw 
<br>
was that fiber in general from any source is what reduced the cancer 
<br>
risk, and it actually wasn't a huge amount of it either... quite a bit 
<br>
less I think than the paleo diet recommends.
<br>
<p>Secondly, one of the key findings of the second study is that eating 
<br>
high nutritional quality meat _lowers_ your risk of cancer further. 
<br>
Specifically they found no link to cancer from red meat consumption (and 
<br>
remember, this is likely low quality meat, not the type recommended by 
<br>
the paleo diet), and reduced cancer risk from eating poultry and even 
<br>
more significantly from eating fish. The only meats shown to increase 
<br>
cancer risks are apparently highly processed meats, which again if you 
<br>
were eating the paleo way you wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm">http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From these results, you have lowest risks for these cancers if you:
<br>
<p>1. Eat a decent amount of fiber from any source, although they generally 
<br>
are talking about fruits/veggies from what I see, not grains.
<br>
<p>2. Don't drink or smoke.
<br>
<p>3. Eat plenty of non-processed meat, especially fish. (my guess though 
<br>
again is that if it were possible to do a study of grain fed vs. grass 
<br>
fed meats there would be even further reduced cancer risks for the grass 
<br>
fed/natural fed meats).
<br>
<p>I hope these and other studies eventually make their raw data publicly 
<br>
available... I bet there are other interesting finds lurking in there.
