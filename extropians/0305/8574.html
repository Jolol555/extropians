<p>
&nbsp;Carnosine is a dipeptide composed of the amino acids histidine and
<br>
beta-alanine that has been sold as a 'life extension' supplement. Studies
<br>
have recently shown that it reduces the problems associated with autism
<br>
in children:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12585724&amp;dopt=Abstract">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12585724&amp;dopt=Abstract</a><br>
&nbsp;There have also been a few scattered reports of it helping adults who
<br>
have autistic tendencies: <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=autism+carnosine">http://groups.google.com/groups?q=autism+carnosine</a>
<br>
&nbsp;Since my personality has features that seem somewhat autistic, I've tried
<br>
Carnosine, and noticed that within a few days it seemed a bit easier for me
<br>
to start conversations with strangers. I haven't noticed any other effects.
<br>
Others have noticed more effects.
<br>
&nbsp;Mike Darwin has mentioned some other cognitive enhancements that he thinks
<br>
may be due to Carnosine (<a href="http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=19975">http://www.cryonet.org/cgi-bin/dsp.cgi?msg=19975</a>).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Here's a strange theory which might explain why people with atypical
<br>
personalities might have atypical amino acid needs (among the many things
<br>
it tries to explain) - a few of our ancestors are Neanderthals:
<br>
<a href="http://www.rdos.net/eng/asperger.htm">http://www.rdos.net/eng/asperger.htm</a> (The Neanderthal theory of autism,
<br>
Asperger and ADHD).
<br>
&nbsp;Some of the arguments in that essay are pretty suspicious, and the author
<br>
is clearly expressing more certainty in places than is reasonable. There's
<br>
some recent mitochondrial dna evidence that seems to rule out the theory
<br>
that Neanderthal females contributed mitochondrial dna to our gene pool:
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3023685.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3023685.stm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;But it may be that human females with larger pelvises than Neanderthals
<br>
were able to interbreed with Neanderthal males, without Neanderthal females
<br>
being able to bear children resulting from interbreeding with humans.
<br>
&nbsp;Can anyone here come up with a stronger criticism of this theory?
