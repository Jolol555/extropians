<p><em>&gt; Personally I agree with those who think CNN is biased to the left,
</em><br>
<p>not to mention ABC, CBS, and several others
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I think it is not nearly as biased as FOX is biased to the right. In my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion FOX has been accused rightly of becoming the unofficial &quot;Mouthpiece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the White House.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I note also from the long discussion we had here about six or eight weeks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago that bias in the news media is very much in the eye of the beholder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People tend not to notice bias in the news when the bias agrees with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political world-view.
</em><br>
<p>I'm unsure what proportion of people on this list suffer that affliction.
<br>
That it is widespread, there can be no doubt, and this really baffles me.
<br>
When I was twelve, my little liberal friend and I had absolutely no 
<br>
difficulty identifying which of our (American) teachers were left, and
<br>
which were right.  Except one.  We waited until the last day of 9th
<br>
grade, just before leaving that junior high school forever, to ask
<br>
Mr. Price if he was liberal or conservative.  Even though there were
<br>
a few telling phrases, we had never been able to pin it down.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am a liberal Republican,&quot; he said with a big grin.  He could probably
<br>
see how amused we were by that response.
<br>
<p>Look, the question is very simple.  Anyone who has the slightest interest
<br>
in politics can tell before too many sentences are spoken just what the
<br>
political leanings of the speaker are.  Therefore, for thirty years or 
<br>
more, what caused American media (both print and television) to so manifestly
<br>
lean leftward?
<br>
<p>You see, speaking in an unbiased manner isn't hard at all.  I'm even
<br>
better at it than Mr. Price when I'm lecturing to children, and there
<br>
is just no way they can determine my politics.  But that's because I'm
<br>
not on a MISSION like some people.  The acid test is simple: after 
<br>
listening to Peter Jennings or Dan Rather for a few weeks, can you or
<br>
can you not tell how they'd vote?  (Hint:  google for &quot;Dan Rather necklaced&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Two things are refreshing about Fox News (and at least one or two
<br>
newscasters on MSNBC):  they're not only providing balance to ABC,
<br>
CBS, NBC, and CNN, but they're quite open about it.  What I hate is
<br>
people pretending they're objective, when they're not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cable news networks are not obliged by law to serve the public interest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is one reason we see extreme advocacy journalism on cable like that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which comes from FOX.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we know how to fix that, don't we?  How about a &quot;Fairness
<br>
Doctrine&quot; which would require stations to carry as much left-biased
<br>
reporting as right-biased (but, of course, not necessarily the
<br>
converse).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a theory about why the non-cable news media tends to be biased to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left: the majority of American news consumers are biased to the left...
</em><br>
<p>No, there are two basic factors:  (1) journalism schools indoctrinate
<br>
their students like nobody's business---conservative students are made
<br>
to feel quite out of it and uncomfortable, and perhaps don't even make
<br>
it through unless they're careful  (2) the kind of people who go into
<br>
journalism often do so to &quot;change the world&quot; with the kind of typical
<br>
idealism so manifest among the young.  Conservatives tend to follow
<br>
other paths.
