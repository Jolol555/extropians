<p><em>&gt; Abstract: [Michael Huemer] look for explanations for the phenomenon of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widespread, strong, and persistent disagreements about political issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best explanation is provided by the hypothesis that most people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational about politics and not, for example, that political issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are particularly difficult or that we lack sufficient evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolving them. I discuss how this irrationality works and why people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are especially irrational about politics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the full essay, see <a href="http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/irrationality.htm">http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/irrationality.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeedy.  I will agree that it is quite a good essay, well-written
<br>
and easy to read, and well-informed on most points.  However, the author
<br>
in my opinion makes several errors.  One is that he fails to appreciate
<br>
how Pan Critical Rationalism explains learning and the retention of 
<br>
hypothesis (which is to say, he fails to acknowledge how conjectures
<br>
really die).  Two, he doesn't address some cases where it seems to me
<br>
obvious that values determine some political stances, and doesn't
<br>
find the simplest explanation for some of his examples, like, duh, look
<br>
to the ambiguity of certain words.  Three, as Harvey hinted at, he has
<br>
a pretty expansive definition of &quot;irrational&quot;---but then, perhaps so
<br>
does Robin Hanson and others (I haven't finished with their papers).
<br>
Finally, he doesn't seem to deal too well with those interesting cases
<br>
where it's &quot;rational to be irrational&quot;.
<br>
<p>Firstly, he writes
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Divergent Fundamental Values theory [which I, Lee, embrace]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we should expect prevalent political belief clusters to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correspond to different basic  moral theories.  Thus there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be some core moral claim that unites all or most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'liberal' political beliefs, and a different moral claim
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that unites all or most 'conservative' political beliefs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What underlying thesis supports the views that (a) capitalism
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is unjust, (b) abortion is permissible, (c) capital punishment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is bad, and (d) affirmative action is just?  Here I need only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claim that these beliefs are *correlated*...
<br>
<p>Well, I can think of two (2) value differences that explain these
<br>
political differences!  One is that liberals rate inequality as
<br>
much more damaging and unfair than do conservatives, and secondly
<br>
many libertarians and conservatives (though not I, incidentally)
<br>
consider it morally *unjust* for rich people's money or hard-
<br>
working people's money to be taken from them by force for the sake
<br>
of the poor.  (I myself happen merely to think that it doesn't work
<br>
out at all well to do so, even though I am a libertarian-conservative.)
<br>
<p>Therefore, the author has not refuted the conjecture that differing
<br>
values are quite important in determining some political differences.
<br>
<p>Now consider his flawed treatment of the capital punishment question.
<br>
He thinks that it comes down to a factual dispute, and that the
<br>
various partisan proponents disagree over the facts about capital
<br>
punishment:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who support capital punishment are much more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely to believe that it has a deterrent effect,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that few innocent people have been executed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who oppose capital punishment tend to believe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it does not have a deterrent effect, and that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many innocent people have been executed.  Those are 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factual [sic] questions, and my moral values should
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not have any effect on what I think about those 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factual questions.
<br>
<p>But those are not EASILY RESOLVED factual questions!  Even more
<br>
importantly, consider the term &quot;many innocent people&quot;.  IMO it
<br>
is very likely that proponents of CP and opponents of CP might
<br>
agree on the numbers, yet still consider it to be, respectively
<br>
&quot;not too many&quot; and &quot;too many&quot;!  Duh.  Why, they'll even disagree
<br>
about whether the particular adage, &quot;better that a thousand guilty
<br>
men go free than one innocent man executed&quot; is wise or not, despite
<br>
it employing a very concrete number!
<br>
<p>I think I'll discuss his idea of &quot;non-epistemic belief preferences&quot;,
<br>
his overly small (IMO) idea of &quot;rationality&quot;, and his failure to
<br>
appreciate PCR in another post.
<br>
