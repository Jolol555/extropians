Emlyn stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;In my more pessimistic moments I always feel that this universe is worth
<br>
being angry about.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The human condition is worth being angry about, if only to motivate us to 
<br>
change it.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Look at the fate of those who went before us; ignominious, really. 
<br>
Implicitly, we assume that we wont share that fate, but that's not at all 
<br>
certain.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>What do ya mean &quot;we&quot; ? :-D 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The very fact that we have scarcity is crazy. Why isn't our environment
<br>
directly manipulable; eg: why is there matter? Humans are having to go to
<br>
absolutely extreme lengths to make matter behave like software (not there
<br>
yet), when it could have been that way from the beginning.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It could also have been harder, I suppose. You are comparing the real world 
<br>
against the happy world of scifi.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Existence just seems so bloody banal.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Wait! Banal is good. Banal can mean security and freedom. Banal is boring, 
<br>
maybe, but don't trade it in for an exciting life in the Central African 
<br>
Republic.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;It's a bad hollywood script that originating from what was once someone's 
<br>
good idea; you can still sense the spark of brilliance in there somewhere, 
<br>
but the implementation of reality seems hopelessly unimaginative and shitty. 
<br>
It's been thought up by the kinds of people that think we'll have traffic 
<br>
jams of flying cars in extreme urban future cities. Stupid.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Look, almost any schmuck can dream up fantasy futures, or fantasy pasts like 
<br>
in LOTR. Putting one's imagination in a compelling plot line with good 
<br>
characters is quite another. Inventing or innovating a new product, a new 
<br>
technology is quite another. The image that what engineers and scientists do 
<br>
comes easy, is the most fictional aspect of all. Its all sizzle and no steak, 
<br>
because the nature of the universe is that complex technical achivements 
<br>
frequently require tremendous work and huge amounts of time. Time is the key, 
<br>
and what is most irritating, isn't it? 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Not to say that these aren't interesting times, and that we can't add a few
<br>
layers of implementation to create a much more satisfactory virtual universe
<br>
running in the real one. But standing back, it really does look like we are
<br>
making the best of an appalling job.
<br>
Emlyn&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Technology is opportunistic; or as Lenin said: &quot;Probe with a bayonet. If you 
<br>
find steel, withdraw, if you find mush, dig in!&quot; The bayonet of technology 
<br>
has found mush in the field of computers, computer electronics, telcom, 
<br>
computer photonics, software design. Future areas or runner-ups seem to be 
<br>
biology, medicine, biotechnology, bioengineering, tissue engineering, and the 
<br>
like. I am not sure where nanotech, MEM's, molecular technology are heading. 
<br>
Materials science seems quite active, and energy and space transportation now 
<br>
seems to be a distant 4th, 5th, or 6th.
<br>
<p>The Zen of this list should be: Grumpiness awakens, when the sojourner 
<br>
realizes that the sci-fi novels, cinema, and futurist documentaries are found 
<br>
to be too optimistic, too soon! 
<br>
