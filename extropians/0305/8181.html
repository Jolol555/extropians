<p>John, this would be consistent with standard &quot;anti-venom&quot; or &quot;anti-toxin&quot;
<br>
therapies.  Patients who have &quot;recovered&quot; are likely to carry a high
<br>
titre of antibodies against the SARS virus -- these antibodies would
<br>
allow the immune system to more quickly and easily engulf and absorb
<br>
SARS virus particles reducing the spread of the infection.  However
<br>
injecting antibodies across species or even between individuals in
<br>
the same species may be relatively problematic.  While the protein
<br>
sequence and 3-D structure of the &quot;common&quot; part of antibodies is
<br>
relatively highly conserved (in contrast to the part of antibodies
<br>
that is designed to &quot;vary&quot; to match the infectious agent) I suspect
<br>
that efficacy may vary across species and individuals.
<br>
<p>Rafal might be better able to comment on this -- it is a &quot;reasonable&quot;
<br>
strategy but one whose &quot;success&quot; may vary from case to case and be
<br>
very difficult to generalize.  It may come down to a question of the
<br>
similarity between the immune systems of the donor and recipient
<br>
(similar to the issues involved in organ transplants).  And we have
<br>
a long history of knowing how sometimes the transplants are successful
<br>
and sometimes they are not.
