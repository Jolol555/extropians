<p>Here's another clue:
<br>
<p>Chlamydia pneumoniae a risk factor for stroke
<br>
<a href="http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/22fc5e.htm">http://www.pslgroup.com/dg/22fc5e.htm</a>
<br>
<p>I believe it also has already been linked to heart disease.
<br>
<p>Is this the next Heliobacter pylori story? It apparently even survives 
<br>
inside macrophages.
<br>
<a href="http://www.immuno-sci-lab.com/html/chlamydia_pneumoniae.html">http://www.immuno-sci-lab.com/html/chlamydia_pneumoniae.html</a>
<br>
<p>Furthermore, could changes in diet increase or decrease the risk? For 
<br>
starters it has been shown that poor teeth/gum health is a risk factor, 
<br>
perhaps by allowing infection by organisms like C. P. What do the 
<br>
bacteria in your mouth generally live on? Carbs. Remember, Eskimos and 
<br>
other low carb eaters have little to no teeth problems.
<br>
<p>Perhaps more interesting is the fact that many short to medium chain 
<br>
fatty acids have antimicrobial/antiviral properties... especially their 
<br>
monoglyceride versions. These particular kinds of fats also are the only 
<br>
ones AFAIK which make their way directly into the bloodstream unmodified 
<br>
when eaten as natural saturated fats. Does the body naturally make and 
<br>
release into the blood its own supply of these, or would eating them be 
<br>
possibly beneficial?
