<em>&gt; This is IMO, but: the full potential of

<p>I humbly disagree.  My career is based on breaking into computer systems and
<br>
revealing how I did it.  I can assure you that I wouldn't get paid my high
<br>
rates if I couldn't break in most of the time.  People would get tired of
<br>
paying me and not getting any surprises back.
<br>
<p>Most systems are deceptively easy to break into.  The reason people don't do
<br>
this is not because systems are secure.  It is because there are so many
<br>
records in the Internet, at the ISP, at the phone company, etc., that it is
<br>
very hard to get away with the crime.  I am almost always successful in
<br>
breaking into computer system.  The secret is that I tell them when I break
<br>
in, and they verify the evidence immediately afterwards, which leaves them
<br>
amazed.  They don't realize that I probably couldn't have gotten away with
<br>
it for very long.
<br>
<p>Some public examples which you probably have heard about:
<br>
- Spammers putting backdoor relays into other people's computers to spread
<br>
spam
<br>
- Microsoft's hotmail letting anyone reset anyone else's password to what
<br>
they want
<br>
- Viruses are obviously common and easy to spread and get inside companies
<br>
- Denial of service attacks are trivial to do and hard to combat
<br>
- Forgeries are constantly done by spammers and rarely traced back to the
<br>
origin
<br>
- Microsoft Outlook is full of product hooks that let executable commands
<br>
get executed
<br>
- Internet Explorer is also full of undocumented hooks to execute commands
<br>
<p>I have seen high level systems, military systems, on-line banking systems,
<br>
and other highly secure systems with trivial security flaws that went
<br>
unnoticed.  Sometimes it is as trivial as editing your local cookie to
<br>
change your userID after the system has already let you in under your own
<br>
ID.  Sometimes it is simply sniffing packets as they go by with cleartext
<br>
passwords that are still used by most mail and web system, and remote logins
<br>
(telnet).  Sometimes it is just a matter of replaying captured packets back
<br>
to a server, even if you don't understand what they are doing, and see if it
<br>
responds.
<br>
<p>Web interfaces are increasingly popular and trivial to break or exploit.
<br>
Almost all websites have buffer overflow problems.  Just type millions of
<br>
characters into a field where the script only expects a few characters.
<br>
Unless the program checks the length, it dutifully copies the entire thing
<br>
into memory, overflowing the program, and overwriting the computer memory.
<br>
At best, this just crashes the computer when it gets its memory filled with
<br>
garbage.  At worse, a good hacker can control what they type in and fill the
<br>
computer memory with their own executable binary code.
<br>
<p>Forms are easy to break.  Take a simple website that asks for a name and
<br>
repeats it back to you.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  &quot;Harvey&quot;  &quot;Hello, Harvey!&quot;  If they
<br>
don't carefully filter out dangerous characters from my input, nothing stops
<br>
me from inserting text into their executing script.  Instead of saying my
<br>
name is &quot;Harvey&quot; and having them &quot;print Hello, Harvey!&quot;, I say my name is
<br>
&quot;Harvey ; delete *.*&quot; and have them execute &quot;print Hello, Harvey&quot; and
<br>
&quot;delete *.*&quot;!  This is trivial stuff that affects most sites.
<br>
<p>Many commerce sites are too stupid to check for unexpected values.  I can
<br>
order negative numbers of items on some sites, and they dutifully will
<br>
deduct the negative prices from my total bill.
<br>
<p>There are whole databases of &quot;known vulnerabilities&quot; that document all these
<br>
known problems in specific versions of software.  Your mail headers tell me
<br>
what version of mail you are running.  Your website identifies itself and
<br>
version number in the header of web sessions (not usually displayed by the
<br>
browser, but available if you know how to access the data).  Servers always
<br>
identify themselves and their version number when you connect, even if you
<br>
don't have a valid login.  All you have to do is look up these products to
<br>
see what known vulnerabilities exist, and just follow the directions.
<br>
<p>Even brute-force methods are viable.  Many online banking systems only have
<br>
four-digit PIN numbers, which yield 9999 passwords.  Many of these don't
<br>
lock out users after failed attempts, because too many people lock
<br>
themselves out.  So, how long does it take to send 9999 packets to a website
<br>
to see if one of them gets in?  On an extremely slow modem sending only 10
<br>
packets per second, it would take about 1000 seconds or 17 minutes.
<br>
<p>Worse, you don't even have to do any technical hacking.  Most banks, credit
<br>
cards, stores and other accounts will let you register on-line to get into
<br>
your account.  They &quot;verify&quot; you by asking your social-security number or
<br>
mother's maiden name or telephone number or street address.  These are all
<br>
matters of public record.   I can get into these accounts for most people
<br>
just by looking up the required information.  No &quot;hacking&quot; required.  This
<br>
should give you a hint how lax security is.  People don't even try that hard
<br>
to achieve security.  They just throw something together with little
<br>
thought.
<br>
<p>The worst example of a lack of thought was the revelation that most
<br>
real-money gambling sites allowed people to just push the &quot;back&quot; button on
<br>
their browser to replay the last turn again.  It seems obvious after the
<br>
fact, but many companies never considered it before hand.  Companies are so
<br>
focused on low-cost, high-production, fast-paced delivery, that security is
<br>
almost always left out or applied as an afterthought.
<br>
<p>Really, these methods are trivial to anybody who wants to learn them.  Only
<br>
people unfamiliar with this stuff doubt it exists.  It is easy to
<br>
demonstrate, easy to learn, and easy to exploit.  And it happens a lot more
<br>
than people think.  Most companies do not publicize when incidents have
<br>
occurred.  I have been hired by many companies to respond to incidents that
<br>
never made the press.
