<em>&gt;&gt; It's a bit premature to proclaim that there were no WMDs.
</em><br>
<p>How are other countries news explaining away the sanitized mobile
<br>
bio-lab being shown on the US news?
<br>
<p>Are there any alternate uses for such a vehicle?

<p>This is true.  However, it is not too soon to declare that U.S.
<br>
intelligence was flawed.  We have already searched hundreds of sites
<br>
where we were &quot;sure&quot; we would find bioweapons manufacturing.  None of
<br>
them turned out to be what the U.S. claimed.  Even if we do eventually
<br>
find something somewhere, it is clear that U.S. intelligence was just
<br>
plain wrong on almost everything.  It may be that they were lying as an
<br>
excuse to attack Iraq.  It may be that they were so interested in
<br>
finding an excuse that the selectively interpreted intelligence reports
<br>
in a way to say what they hoped they would say.  But the bottom line is
<br>
that other countries won't put up with our claim that we have secret
<br>
evidence that will be presented later.  From now on, I expect the U.S.
<br>
will be distrusted unless it shows clear evidence up front.
<br>
<p>(This applies to &quot;enemy combatants&quot; as well, now that dozens of the
<br>
prisoners have been released from Guantanamo with no connection to any
<br>
crimes or war activity.  Secret evidence and hidden tribunals always
<br>
fail to be fair, and this round has been no different.  The world won't
<br>
put up with their citizens being detained without notification, without
<br>
lawyers, without evidence, and without a chance to defend themselves.)
