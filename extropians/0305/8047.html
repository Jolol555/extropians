<em>&gt; OPEC as a tool of advancing muslim international agendas is over unless

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLACK GOLD -- AGAIN
<br>
<p>The Siljan Ring and T. Gold are back in the news again. A few
<br>
years ago, at Gold's instigation, private investors and the
<br>
Swedish govenment put up money to drill for oil and gas at
<br>
the Siljan Ring, some 200 kilometers northwest of
<br>
Stockholm. This granitic region is a meteor-created,
<br>
shattered scar on the earth's crust. It is in just such a spot
<br>
that Gold expects to find abiogenic petroleum and methane
<br>
seeping upward from deep inside the earth, where they have
<br>
resided since the earth was formed. Con-ventional
<br>
petroleum geologists have roundly ridiculed the Siljan Ring
<br>
project; after all, everyone knows that oil and gas derive
<br>
from buried organic matter. 
<br>
<p>Three years ago, at a depth of 6.7 kilometers, the
<br>
&quot;misguided&quot; Swedish drillers pumped 12 tons of oily sludge
<br>
from the granite rock. &quot;Just drilling fluids and diesel-oil
<br>
pumped down from the surface,&quot; laughed the experts. This
<br>
autumn (1991), more oil was struck in a new hole only 2.8
<br>
kilometers deep. This time, only water was used to lubricate
<br>
the drill. How are the skeptics going to explain this? Well,
<br>
about 20 kilometers away, there are sedimentary rocks;
<br>
perhaps the oil seeped into the granite from there.
<br>
Rejecting this interpretation, the drillers are going deeper
<br>
in hopes of finding primordial methane. (Aldhous, Peter;
<br>
&quot;Black Gold Causes a Stir,&quot; Nature, 353:593, 199l.
<br>
Anonymous; &quot;Black Gold,&quot; The Economist, p. 101, October 19,
<br>
1991. Cr. T. Brown) 
<br>
<p>Reference. T. Gold's iconoclastic ideas are the origin of oil
<br>
and methane are reviewed in ESC13 and ESC16 in our
<br>
catalog: Anomalies in Geology. To order, visit: here.
