'Oldest sculpture' found in Morocco
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
By Paul Rincon 
<br>
BBC Science 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p>A 400,000-year-old stone object unearthed in Morocco could be the world's 
<br>
oldest attempt at sculpture. The figurine was found 15 metres below ground
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
That is the claim of a prehistoric art specialist who says the ancient rock 
<br>
bears clear signs of modification by humans. 
<br>
<p>The object, which is around six centimetres in length, is shaped like a human 
<br>
figure, with grooves that suggest a neck, arms and legs. On its surface are 
<br>
flakes of a red substance that could be remnants of paint. 
<br>
<p>The object was found 15 metres below the eroded surface of a terrace on the 
<br>
north bank of the river Draa near the town of Tan-Tan. It was reportedly lying 
<br>
just a few centimetres away from stone handaxes in ground layers dating to the 
<br>
Middle Acheulian period, which lasted from 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. 
<br>
<p>Cultural controversy 
<br>
<p>The find is likely to further fuel a vociferous debate over the timing of 
<br>
humanity's discovery of symbolism. Hominids such as Homo heidelbergensis and Homo 
<br>
erectus, that were alive during the Acheulian period, are not thought to have 
<br>
been capable of the symbolic thought needed to create art. 
<br>
<p>Writing in the journal Current Anthropology, Robert Bednarik, president of 
<br>
the International Federation of Rock Art Organisations (IFRAO), suggests that 
<br>
the overall shape of the Tan-Tan object was fashioned by natural processes. 
<br>
<p>But he argues that conspicuous grooves on the surface of the stone, which 
<br>
appear to emphasise its humanlike appearance, are partially man-made. Mr Bednarik 
<br>
claims that some of these grooves were made by repeated battering with a 
<br>
stone tool to connect up natural depressions in the rock. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;What we've got is a piece of stone that is largely naturally shaped. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It has some modifications, but they are more than modifications,&quot; Mr 
<br>
Bednarik told BBC News Online. 
<br>
<p>Mr Bednarik tried to replicate the markings on a similar piece of rock by 
<br>
hitting a stone flake with a &quot;hammerstone&quot; in the manner of a punch. He then 
<br>
compared the microscopic structure of the fractures with those of the Tan-Tan 
<br>
object. 
<br>
<p>Sceptic's view 
<br>
<p>However, Professor Stanley Ambrose of the University of Illinois, 
<br>
Urbana-Champaign said he saw no evidence for tool marks and that, although the figure was 
<br>
evocative, it was most likely the result of &quot;fortuitous natural weathering&quot;. 
<br>
<p>&quot;He [Mr Bednarik] has effectively presented all the information necessary to 
<br>
show this is a naturally weathered rock,&quot; Professor Ambrose told BBC News 
<br>
Online. 
<br>
<p>Professor Ambrose points to Mr Bednarik's observation that some rocks in the 
<br>
vicinity of the figure were weathered and even rounded from transport by 
<br>
water. Professor Ambrose believes that rocks and artifacts found at the site could 
<br>
have been disturbed by flowing water in the past. 
<br>
<p>Mr Bednarik also observes that flecks of a greasy substance containing iron 
<br>
and manganese on the surface of the stone could be red ochre, a substance used 
<br>
as paint by later humans. 
<br>
<p>&quot;They [the specks] do not resemble corroded natural iron deposits, nor has 
<br>
any trace of this pigment been detected on any of the other objects I have 
<br>
examined from Tan-Tan,&quot; writes Mr Bednarik in the paper. 
<br>
<p>A 200,000-300,000-year-old stone object found at Berekhat Ram in Israel in 
<br>
1986 has also been the subject of claims that it is a figurine. However, several 
<br>
other researchers later presented evidence that it was shaped by geological 
<br>
processes. 
<br>
<p>The Tan-Tan object was discovered in 1999, during a dig directed by Lutz 
<br>
Fiedler, the state archaeologist of Hesse in Germany.
