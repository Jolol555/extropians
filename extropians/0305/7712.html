<p>Maybe so.  But you seemed to imply that these studies supported the Paleo
<br>
Diet, and then he quotes your thread when he said he was &quot;glad to see some
<br>
studies....&quot;  I was just making sure that he was not being mislead by your
<br>
statements in the exact way I thought they seemed misleading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case please read our words again, Harvey. Brian was pointing out
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; the authors gave no reason to believe fiber from grains is superior to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other kind of plant fiber. I was merely agreeing with Brian. Neither of us

</em><br>
<p>There is a big difference between &quot;gave no reason to believe...&quot; and saying
<br>
the study supports your position.  The Paleo Diet that you are pushing
<br>
forbids eating grains.  This study was about eating a diet including grains.
<br>
To say that it supports the Paleo Diet seems misleading when the diet in
<br>
supports directly violates the anti-grain provision of the Paleo Diet.  You
<br>
are interpreting that the same high-fiber effects of that diet can be
<br>
achieved with the Paleo Diet, and would hopefully give similar results, but
<br>
this is your belief (even if right) and does not derive from this study in
<br>
any way.
