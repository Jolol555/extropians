</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nick Bostrom:  &quot;Fifteen percent.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer Yudkowsky:  &quot;Mine is twenty percent.&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer Yudkowsky:  &quot;I'll keep the twenty.  Here's eight dollars and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifty-seven cents.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that's how it works.
</em><br>
<p>I'm surprised that your two estimates were so low.  At the time of your
<br>
conversation, you said that you both knew that the other didn't think it
<br>
was their $20 bill, and you had both spent some effort to verify this,
<br>
counting the money in your wallets and such.  It's strange that you
<br>
each thought that there was an 80 to 85 percent chance that the other
<br>
person had made a mistake about how much money he had paid, even after he
<br>
had gone through the same careful verification procedure that you had.
<br>
I would have expected that the kind of objective, symmetrical reasoning
<br>
required by meta-rationality would lead you to place a greater credibility
<br>
on the statements of the other person.
<br>
<p>I also wonder how you might have each adjusted your probabilities upon
<br>
hearing the estimates of the other.  Given that the two probabilities
<br>
have to sum to 1, what you basically have is an estimate by Nick of 85%
<br>
that the bill was Elizer's, and an estimate by Eliezer of 20% for the
<br>
same fact.  I believe Robin's result is that upon hearing these estimates,
<br>
each of you would adjust his own estimate, and would now expect that the
<br>
other's adjusted estimate would be about the same as you's.  At least,
<br>
you would not be able to predict whether the other person's estimate
<br>
was now greater or less than your updated value.
<br>
<p>It might have made sense for you to have exchanged a few more estimates.
<br>
Chances are you would have converged quickly and been able to split the
<br>
money on that basis.
<br>
