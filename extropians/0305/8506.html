</em><br>
<em>&gt; The polls, police department and all city - county offices

</em><br>
<em>&gt; voting when they needed every possible vote to carry the state?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Frankly, I am puzzled.
</em><br>
<p>Living in Florida, I can assure you that this is not an urban legend.  It
<br>
really happened.  The police used were county sheriffs and republicans.  The
<br>
rules for elections were dictated by Katherine Harris who supervisor of
<br>
elections while also being on Bush's campaign team.  The Tallahassee
<br>
computers the knocked blacks off the rolls were programmed by Jeb Bush and a
<br>
company from Texas.  The democrats didn't do any of this stuff.  It was all
<br>
done by the Republicans.
<br>
<p>The reason it was seen as a racial issue is that blacks tend to be poorer,
<br>
less likely to not have multiple forms of ID, and more likely to be scared
<br>
of police or have warrants of other issues that made them afraid to vote.
<br>
(Basically, by running criminal checks, they made it so nobody with legal
<br>
problems, even minor ones, could vote.  This unofficially prevented people
<br>
with speeding tickets, unpaid child support, etc., unable to get past the
<br>
police to get into the voting booth.)
<br>
<p>Also, the company hired by Jeb Bush accidentally removed all people with
<br>
criminal records from the rolls, not just people with felonies.  This
<br>
eliminated thousands of people (mostly blacks) who had minor arrest records
<br>
from voting, even though they legally should have been able to vote.
