The truth about SARS is that this image should never have been on Time's
cover, nor that of Newsweek and U.S News &amp; World Report.
Last week's covers of U.S. News &amp; World Report, Time, and Newsweek were
virtually identical: A terrified person wearing a medical mask emblazoned
&quot;SARS.&quot; The April 29 New Zealand Herald headlined: &quot;SARS Surge Could Stretch
NZ Says Annette King.&quot; Total confirmed New Zealand cases: one. &quot;SARS could
eventually kill millions,&quot; blared the New Scientist wire service, with no
hint as to how this might happen. SARS &quot;now threatens to plunge the world
economy into freefall,&quot; declared the London Observer. The New York Times has
printed over 330 articles mentioning the disease in the last 30 days, while
even the staid Wall Street Journal published ten SARS articles on a single
day.
University of Toronto Medical historian Edward Shorter calls SARS reaction
&quot;A media-fanned wave of mass hysteria,&quot; and &quot;mass psychosis.&quot; But is he
overstating the case?
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) as of May 6, 6727 cases of
SARS have been reported since mid-November with 478 deaths. In what at a
glance seems one of the few slight concessions to reality Slate reported:
&quot;SARS is not quite as contagious as the flu.&quot; But that's a slight
understatement. Flu causes between &quot;three and five million cases of severe
illness and between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths&quot; per year, according to the
WHO – far more serious illness and death in a single day than SARS has
caused in 21 weeks. Far more Americans die of influenza each year during flu
season (about 36,000) than have yet been killed by SARS globally. Yet few
Americans would die of flu if only they were worried enough to roll up their
sleeves for a $15 (or often free) vaccination
SARS is repeatedly referred to as &quot;killer pneumonia,&quot; as if pneumonia
normally causes just hiccups. Yet 62,000 Americans died of pneumonia in
2001. The media are fascinated by the possibility that this virus came to us
from animals, displaying incredible ignorance that so does the flu. SARS
stories often invoke the great flu pandemic of 1918-1919, which probably
killed 40 million people according to WHO estimates. That's more than ten
times as many people daily – among a global population a third of today's –
as SARS has yet killed.
Even today, malaria and tuberculosis – which like SARS are both essentially
localized and yet global – kill perhaps 15,000 people daily.
A far better name for the disease would be &quot;The China Syndrome.&quot; Ninety
percent of all SARS cases are concentrated in China (including Hong Kong),
up from 82 percent on April 1. Of the 153 new cases reported May 6, only six
were outside China. Only about 15 percent of the world's nations have
reported even one SARS case.
Why China? Hong Kong's medical care system has gone to pieces since the
communists took over, and China's hygiene is as bad as its health care. The
last time my wife and I went to Shanghai for a week we got our shots and
avoided the water, yet as soon as we got back we had three emergency room
trips between us.
Between them, malaria and TB kill more people in an hour than the world has
lost thus far to SARS.
Is Asia in general a SARS hotbed?
The April 26 Los Angeles Times reported, &quot;SARS continued to spread across
Asia on Friday,&quot; and a Bangkok-based paper reported on April 19, &quot;The SARS
virus has now hit nearly every country in Asia, spreading fear, panic, and
economic chaos in its wake.&quot; Yet more than half of East Asian and Southeast
Asian nations report no SARS cases.
Japan was last reported with two cases and no deaths, while India is listed
as having one case and no deaths.
How contagious is the disease in countries with good hygiene and health
care?
On April 1, Europe had 21 SARS cases; on May 6 it had 36. Only one of these
was transmitted locally, with the other patients infected in Asia. Indeed,
of the 29 countries outside of China reporting SARS cases, merely four have
reported local transmission. Moreover, the WHO now says that aside from
China the worldwide infection rate is decreasing. For example, Vietnam has a
relatively high number of cases, 63, but hasn't reported a new one since
April 14.
How lethal is SARS?
Globally, it's about seven percent, in the same league as other forms of
pneumonia. This is notwithstanding the May 1 Washington Post reporting that
WHO official Mark Salter said it was 10 percent. A CNN.com article that day
was titled: &quot;SARS Death Rate Rising,&quot; but it had Salter saying it &quot;could
likely reach 10 percent.&quot; &quot;Could&quot; and &quot;is&quot; are not the same.
CNN paraphrased Salter's explanation that &quot;the disease is still in its early
stages&quot; and &quot;it was normal for death rates to increase in such
circumstances.&quot; But the opposite is true. With relatively unknown illnesses,
death rates tend to drop as hospitals become more adept at treating
symptoms. Is it coincidence that while the death rate is about seven percent
in China, there have been no fatalities from 101 cases in Europe and the
U.S? Not that this stopped the Post from reporting, &quot;Surprisingly, the
highest death rates appear to be occurring in the most advanced parts of the
world.&quot; Surprising, indeed!
Canada is admittedly a strange exception to the rule, yet there as
everywhere the disease is gnat on an elephant's butt compared to flu, and
Canada has reported only six new cases in the past ten days. This may also
rightly put the last nail in the coffin of the idea that Canada has a
wonderful health care system that the U.S. should emulate.
Could the virus mutate to become more lethal? Usually it's the other way
around, as natural selection favors strains that are less lethal and thus
likelier to survive indefinitely in the host.
Even in Asia, most countries have reported no SARS cases.
Yet much of the talk of economic gloom and doom may well be true, if only
because perception prevails over reality. Airline industries around the
world have been struck yet another powerful blow, as has the entire travel
and tourism industry and the Asian manufacturing sector.
The World Bank revised its East Asian growth downward by almost ten percent,
in part due to the SARS impact on tourism and other face-to-face sectors
such as business travel, transportation and retail. Stock markets are being
slammed, with Hong Kong plummeting to their lowest levels in four years. The
SARS outbreak could cost Canada's economy up to $2.1 billion in lost growth
this year, according to a major Toronto bank forecast.
Nor is it just markets; human beings are feeling the impact right now.
Persons of Chinese origin are being discriminated against in various
countries, with Chinatowns becoming ghost towns. &quot;The impact could be
devastating&quot; for Asian migrant workers, according to a top U.N. demographer.
A foreign tourist was held in involuntary quarantine in New York City for
virtually his ten-day vacation because he had a fever and ubiquitous
&quot;flu-like symptoms,&quot; while U.C. Berkeley has barred summer session students
from China and other regions of Asia with relatively high numbers of SARS
cases. Would they do so for the far-more-contagious and equally lethal flu?
A bit of fear can be useful in controlling an epidemic. But that applies to
rational fear, not hysteria. Did people's refusal to sit near AIDS patients
slow that epidemic? Will refusing to sit next to a Canadian of Asian descent
slow the spread of SARS?
This global hysteria has no upside. As Shorter says, even as it appears in
most places the disease is being contained, &quot;What hasn't been contained is
the mass psychosis surrounding it. It's entirely the working of the media;
this need never have happened.&quot; In fairness though, public health officials
have also contributed.
Roosevelt's assertion in 1933 &quot;that the only thing we have to fear is fear
itself&quot; was certainly an overgeneralization; but it has never been more
applicable than during the SARS hysteria.
