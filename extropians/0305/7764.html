gummint.

<p>I'd be more concerned by the likely increase in demand for corn chips

brought about by legalization, with so much more of the population

getting the munchies more frequently... ;)
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exercise in imagination and rhetoric, never to be the basis of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your voting or lobbying?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Somehow I can hardly believe it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep. In response to the hunters' claim that their hunting (which they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have always done anyway) is the only &quot;rational wildlife management&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can prevent overpopulation &amp; starvation of wild animals. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of an alternative (which some have implemented, not me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not officially that I know of) disproves their point. 
</em><br>
<p>That you are full of it disproves your point. Outside of a few islands
<br>
denuded of vegetation by deer or sheep, there is noplace where
<br>
sterilization has been practiced, and it only worked there because it
<br>
was so easy to trap the animals. Imagine the torture these animals went
<br>
through getting trapped. In fact, a significant percentage died from
<br>
fear induced heart attacks, overdosed anesthetics, or infections from
<br>
sterilization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ### What kind of evidence would you like to offer in support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What evidence would you expect? I have a cousin who is a hunter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and I've never heard him exclaim, &quot;Wow, I caught a really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; scrawny, young, lame one today! Me big hunter!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Hearsay!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you are telling me all hunters deliberately try to catch the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inferior animals?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we try to catch the dumbest animals. Intelligence matters far more
<br>
than size in a successful hunt. Most hunters never get to pick and
<br>
choose their game, they generally shoot the first legal animal that is
<br>
dumb enough to get in their crosshairs. Only the most skilled and
<br>
patient hunters will intentionally overlook such game in search of
<br>
trophy animals. Trophies are not always guaged by weight. Most tropies
<br>
are guaged by the score of the antlers, which generally has little
<br>
relationship to the size of the animal and instead reflects the animals
<br>
maturity and hormone levels, except in the case of atypical antlers
<br>
(the type that squirly all over the place wildly) which are thought to
<br>
be caused by a virus or parasite, or possibly mineral deposits in the
<br>
animals habitat.
<br>
<p>Most bucks that are shot have rather inferior antlers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### If enough people are really concerned about the welfare of deer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and truly want to help them by sterilization, you will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gather enough funds. Of course, it's easier to ask the local 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; congressman to do pay for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with other people's money, but I think I might be digressing here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People don't know what they want. 
</em><br>
<p>Ah, yes, the old liberal &quot;The uncultured masses need we educated and
<br>
enlightened elites to tell them what to think and do...&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Hunters know they want to hunt, and the political system is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to match their intentions. Animal lovers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too disorganized, politically naive or unconnected, have no political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system (machine) in place. What people *want*, and how many of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want it, is of only partial relevance to what happens. People don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want smog in their cities, either, but there it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Me an agitator for the Endloesung of Earth's living problems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That couldn't be true!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are the super villains - Gnostic types dedicated to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extermination of everything in order to end all suffering - all human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, animal life, and even inanimate matter. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### If you were to say that hunters actually are *not* like child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; molesters, I could retract my assessment of your beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have to retract something I didn't say. I said *remunerating*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters for not being able to hunt would be like remunerating child
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molesters for not being able to molest children. I suspect hunters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be rather above being bribed anyway - they want to hunt - no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of money would satisfy them to give up hunting. And there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an analogy to that for child molesters, too. And to my position - I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not accept any payment from hunters to compensate for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devastation, because that would be utterly irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>One more example of how it is impossible for lefties to be guilty of ad
<br>
hominem, since their cause is so just and right and good, and their
<br>
opponents so wrong and evil and stupid and perverted, that making any
<br>
sort of comparison, no matter how libelous, is entirely appropriate.
<br>
<p>Yet they howl like banshees when the tables are turned...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### As in: &quot;We just voted that you can't hunt, here or everywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It makes us quite happy to vote, you know.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I noted before that your ethics is incommensurate with mine, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think the difference lies not in the superficialities of money but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the value of freedom - this is the bedrock of my ethics, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not yours. It leads to happiness, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMHO freedom is a means to an end, not an end. Freedom not exercised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughtfully, beneficially, with other goals in mind, is just a blank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; check of power. It can be abused, lost, sold to the highest bidder. 
</em><br>
<p>i.e. If the ignorant masses don't use their freedoms in only prescribed
<br>
ways, prescribed by we, the educated enlightened illuminated elites of
<br>
the loony left, then what you have is fascism...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Blowing a hole in the brain isn't painful. Being shot in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chest with a large caliber hunting rifle for a human is hardly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; painful at all in the beginning (there are descriptions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; survivors), so animals couldn't feel much pain, either. Much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less than the pain of being eaten alive by a wildcat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any pain caused by humans is pain the humans are responsible for, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if unnecessary, it is their fault, and its meaning and significance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is well known to humans, and cannot be blamed on instinctive nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (such as wildcats).
</em><br>
<p>Momentary pain is always less bad than an hour of torture or years of
<br>
age induced pain and disease. Whether a wildcat can be blamed or not is
<br>
entirely irrelevant to the deer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would remind you that not all hunted animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are killed with a single shot to the head (pace hunters' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentions), or killed in a single instant. It's my understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that many hunters actually enjoy trailing the wounded animal. 
</em><br>
<p>One more instance demonstrating your ignorance. Beyond the actual care
<br>
hunters have for the pain of their prey, trailing a wounded animal is a
<br>
royal pain in the buttocks, especially if it extends beyond nightfall.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is illogical to argue that any wild animal not shot by a hunter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would immediately then otherwise be eaten alive by a wildcat. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is such a thing as living a longer life, having more enjoyable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences, that are not insignificant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the animal and should not be insignificant to us. 
</em><br>
<p>Longer life as a wild animal only means more pain, more suffering.
<br>
Freezing winters, rain, parasites gnawing at your guts, your brains,
<br>
and your hooves, sucking your blood, as well as falling prey to
<br>
predators, getting chased to exhaustion by the idiot dogs of idiot
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### You can have fun doing the rational thing, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Only Puritans though anything that feels good must be bad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh no, I am sure feeding and sterilizing wild animals is quite fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I bet it also makes a person feel good inside, proud of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves and their compassionate relationship with the animals.
</em><br>
<p>So, this is something you've never done, have absolutely no experience
<br>
in, and are just blowing smoke out your rear end.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### But deer are fungible automatons, not irreplaceable individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or sentimentally important works of art.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is the proof of the incommensurability of our philosophies. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement is the exact opposite of what I believe.
</em><br>
<p>Proof only that you are a fruitcake.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### The developers have only as much money as their clients are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; willing to pay. If clients become rich enough to dream about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unspoiled nature, they will build it, too. It's all a question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demand and supply. If human happiness demands the last inch to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; built up, or every inch to be turned into a forest, the market 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will provide. Really.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The market will provide&quot; has almost a religious ring to it. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market will not provide me or anyone else Tasmanian wolves or woolly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammoths, no matter how much I would be willing to pay for them (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe me, there are people in this world who would and could pay 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast fortunes for them). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some stupid mistakes are irrevocable. And wiser folks cannot always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be everywhere and rich enough to buy off fools.
</em><br>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that you are nothing but a luddite troll
<br>
surveilling this list who couldn't take it any more and had to butt in
<br>
with your fruitcakery.
