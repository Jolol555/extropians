<em>&gt;&gt;<a href="http://www.ravnskov.nu/cholesterol.htm">http://www.ravnskov.nu/cholesterol.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 1 starts out true.  But then he says there is no such thing as good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol or bad cholesterol.  He talks as if there is only one type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol.  He ignores the differences between HDL and LDLs.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, he goes on and spends the majority of the page discussing HDL 
<br>
and LDL.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 2 is not a logical argument.  Just because &quot;many&quot; people with normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blood cholesterol still become atherosclerotic, does not contradict the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement that most people with high blood cholesterol do become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atherosclerotic.
</em><br>
<p>Yes it is badly worded on the homepage, but the subpage goes into plenty 
<br>
of details.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 3 is a non-sequitur.  Just because dietary cholesterol does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly control serum cholesterol does not imply that other dietary factors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also useless in controlling serum cholesterol.  His statement that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body produces its own cholesterol far beyond the amount you eat is a clue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it must be created out of some substance other than dietary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol.
</em><br>
<p>Again, the subpage does a better job if you read it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 4 is just plain false.  Hundreds if not thousands of studies have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been performed that show a statistical link between animal fat and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol consumption and atherosclerosis or heart attacks.  Just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twenty of them failed to show this is hardly a refutation of all the rest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (It is perfectly possible that these studies were all wrong or flawed, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to claim there is no evidence is misleading.  There is evidence, and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs to refute it if he can.)
</em><br>
<p>Dr. Ravnskov loves to get emails. Drop him a line and prove him wrong. I 
<br>
want to also see this evidence. He makes a claim at the bottom of that 
<br>
subpage:
<br>
<p>&quot;The crucial test is the controlled, randomised trial. Eight such trials 
<br>
using diet as the only treatment has been performed (76), but neither 
<br>
the number of fatal or non-fatal heart attacks was reduced significantly 
<br>
in any of these trials, not even if the results were added in a 
<br>
meta-analysis. A recent, small trial, which included the addition of 
<br>
alfa-linolenic acid to the diet, was succesful (77), but in that trial 
<br>
the serum cholesterol concentration was unaltered by the diet leaving us 
<br>
with more questions than answers.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 5 is unproven.  It is not clear that the only way to lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol is with drugs.  I think diet, exercise and nutrients can help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too.  It is hard to prove a negative, this statement seems to ignore a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of evidence.  He especially ignores exercise as a possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol-lowering activity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes I am confused here because the title of the subpage is &quot;5. 
<br>
Cholesterol-lowering may shorten your life&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 6 seems to contradict number 5.  He stated in 5 that no drugs improve
</em><br>
<p>Read more carefully.. he says no drugs which are cholesterol-lowering 
<br>
ONLY. At the bottom of the #5 subpage he mentions statins.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; mortality, but then he concedes that new statin drugs to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cardio-vascular disease.  He also points out that these cause cancer in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rodents, but this is a non-sequitur pot-shot.  He is trying to talk people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of using these drugs, but this is tangential to whether they help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent heart problems.
</em><br>
<p>I think if you read carefully, he is attacking the idea that cholesterol 
<br>
(LDL or otherwise) is the &quot;important thing to watch for&quot; when it comes 
<br>
to heart disease. And that because of this erroneous status it is now 
<br>
used as an excuse to place many people on these drugs (which DO have 
<br>
serious side effects... one of them was already pulled off the market in 
<br>
2001 for 100+ deaths) who actually might not need to be medicated if 
<br>
other factors such as their homocystein levels were tested, and if the 
<br>
medical establishment would come around to the idea that cholesterol may 
<br>
only be a symptom at most, not a cause.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 7 is just conspiracy rambling.  He adds no more information, but says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is all a conspiracy to keep the truth hidden.
</em><br>
<p>I think if you really study the history of this scientific area, there 
<br>
are indeed many (sadly typical) examples of politics getting in the way 
<br>
of the science. The guy that first discovered the homocystein link back 
<br>
in the 70s lost his job because of politics (he claims). The government 
<br>
and associated scientists pushed the prudent diet/food pyramid and 
<br>
associated &quot;healthy&quot;/&quot;unhealthy&quot; cholesterol levels onto the public with 
<br>
extremely poor backing evidence. See the articles from Gary Taubes for 
<br>
instance: <a href="http://nasw.org/mem-maint/awards/The%20soft%20science.pdf">http://nasw.org/mem-maint/awards/The%20soft%20science.pdf</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Number 8 is more conspiracy theory with no added facts.
</em><br>
<p>Did you read the subpage? It appears to have facts. He even published a 
<br>
paper on it in Journal of Clinical Epidemiology 1995;48:713-719.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But none of these directly discuss cholesterol or saturated fats in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet.  He gives no statement that cholesterol or saturated fats are good for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to eat.  All his stuff seems to be against the idea that dietary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol causes serum cholesterol or heat attacks.  This is true.  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were older theories that were replaced with the newer idea that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different kinds of fats and cholesterol, and some are good while others are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad, and raising/lowering total fat or cholesterol is inconclusive.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other words, I don't see any of these theories being much related to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of whether saturated fat is good or required.  I agree with these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories, but disagree with the latter question.
</em><br>
<p>This work of his is clearly aimed at demolishing the lipid hypothesis, 
<br>
including the updated versions of it. It is not aimed at proving a new 
<br>
hypothesis that eating saturated fat is the best thing to eat, or 
<br>
anything else. I hope he does however progress on to helping to figure 
<br>
out what the true causes of CVD are and how to reduce your chances of 
<br>
being afflicted.
