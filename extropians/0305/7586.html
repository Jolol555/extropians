<p>Number 1 starts out true.  But then he says there is no such thing as good
<br>
cholesterol or bad cholesterol.  He talks as if there is only one type of
<br>
cholesterol.  He ignores the differences between HDL and LDLs.
<br>
<p>Number 2 is not a logical argument.  Just because &quot;many&quot; people with normal
<br>
blood cholesterol still become atherosclerotic, does not contradict the
<br>
statement that most people with high blood cholesterol do become
<br>
atherosclerotic.
<br>
<p>Number 3 is a non-sequitur.  Just because dietary cholesterol does not
<br>
directly control serum cholesterol does not imply that other dietary factors
<br>
are also useless in controlling serum cholesterol.  His statement that the
<br>
body produces its own cholesterol far beyond the amount you eat is a clue
<br>
that it must be created out of some substance other than dietary
<br>
cholesterol.
<br>
<p>Number 4 is just plain false.  Hundreds if not thousands of studies have
<br>
been performed that show a statistical link between animal fat and
<br>
cholesterol consumption and atherosclerosis or heart attacks.  Just because
<br>
twenty of them failed to show this is hardly a refutation of all the rest.
<br>
(It is perfectly possible that these studies were all wrong or flawed, but
<br>
to claim there is no evidence is misleading.  There is evidence, and he
<br>
needs to refute it if he can.)
<br>
<p>Number 5 is unproven.  It is not clear that the only way to lower
<br>
cholesterol is with drugs.  I think diet, exercise and nutrients can help
<br>
too.  It is hard to prove a negative, this statement seems to ignore a lot
<br>
of evidence.  He especially ignores exercise as a possible
<br>
cholesterol-lowering activity.
<br>
<p>Number 6 seems to contradict number 5.  He stated in 5 that no drugs improve
<br>
mortality, but then he concedes that new statin drugs to prevent
<br>
cardio-vascular disease.  He also points out that these cause cancer in
<br>
rodents, but this is a non-sequitur pot-shot.  He is trying to talk people
<br>
out of using these drugs, but this is tangential to whether they help
<br>
prevent heart problems.
<br>
<p>Number 7 is just conspiracy rambling.  He adds no more information, but says
<br>
it is all a conspiracy to keep the truth hidden.
<br>
<p>Number 8 is more conspiracy theory with no added facts.
<br>
<p>But none of these directly discuss cholesterol or saturated fats in the
<br>
diet.  He gives no statement that cholesterol or saturated fats are good for
<br>
you to eat.  All his stuff seems to be against the idea that dietary
<br>
cholesterol causes serum cholesterol or heat attacks.  This is true.  These
<br>
were older theories that were replaced with the newer idea that there are
<br>
different kinds of fats and cholesterol, and some are good while others are
<br>
bad, and raising/lowering total fat or cholesterol is inconclusive.  In
<br>
other words, I don't see any of these theories being much related to the
<br>
question of whether saturated fat is good or required.  I agree with these
<br>
theories, but disagree with the latter question.
