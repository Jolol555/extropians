<em>&gt; Certainly, I can understand why a 13-year-old would think that (most

</em><br>
<p>Also remember that this boy is still in the formative stages gathering
<br>
input.  He just finished his degree.  He has been learning everything given
<br>
to him.  I have no doubt that he excelled in his learning of the Bible and
<br>
church studies as well.  He has not yet gotten to the stage where he is
<br>
questioning what he has learned or started producing new ideas to replace
<br>
the old ideas yet.  That comes with experience.
<br>
<p>All in all, I think he sounds very well adjusted and successful considering
<br>
the burden of going to college while underage.  (I know!)
<br>
<p>In this case, it is WE who are being arrogant thinking we are in some sort
<br>
of position to judge this stranger on the basis of a few news clippings.
