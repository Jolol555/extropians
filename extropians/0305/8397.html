<br>
<p>&quot;Evidence, please? I don't recall gay activists
<br>
arguing for the right to infect innocent people or try
<br>
to kill them. Remember that I lived through 
<br>
this movement you are recalling. It would be like me
<br>
telling a Viet Nam vet what really happened in the
<br>
fox-holes. Do you really believe that gay 
<br>
rights advocates demanded the right to infect people
<br>
or kill people? This seems preposterous on the face of
<br>
it. I am certain that this story has been 
<br>
&quot;interpreted&quot; from a conservative commentator. I would
<br>
sure love to see references and examine the original
<br>
source for this.&quot;
<br>
<p>One of the local papers a few years ago interviewed
<br>
local bar patrons - non-gay bars - about whether they
<br>
would tell a sexual partner if they were HIV positive.
<br>
&nbsp;Most said &quot;No.&quot;  Anecdotally, I knew a young
<br>
Vietnamese guy who came to the U.S. in the early
<br>
'90's, apparently related to a GI.  He had been more
<br>
or less living on the streets in Vietnam for some time
<br>
and picked up some bad habits.  Once here, he
<br>
immediately got involved with the gangs, drug selling,
<br>
selling stolen phone card numbers, wrecked a whole
<br>
string of cars, knocked up a 17 yr. old Vietnamese
<br>
girl and then, after marrying her, immediately started
<br>
creating a string of girlfriends on the side, all of
<br>
which he considered normal behavior.  
<br>
<p>When the subject of AIDS and disclosure came up, his
<br>
response: ~&quot;Hey! I know plenty people got AIDS don't
<br>
tell nobody, just have sex like everybody.  No big
<br>
deal.&quot;  From his defensive emotional attitude at the
<br>
time, I give a high probability to his in fact being
<br>
HIV positive himself, which might help explain why his
<br>
brother in law nearly beat him to death shortly
<br>
thereafter.
<br>
<p>The key element here is not race, ethnicity (altho
<br>
ethnic attitudes can certainly play a major role), or
<br>
sexual preference (altho certain kinds of sex are
<br>
demonstrably a lot safer than others in terms of
<br>
disease transmission).  It is the combination of
<br>
irresponsibility and promiscouity.
