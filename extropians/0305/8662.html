<p>Actually there is a third possibility which is that the body naturally 
<br>
adjusts and from then on it only produces enough ketones to meet needs, 
<br>
so no &quot;extras&quot; get excreted.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I think the important thing that has been shown by this study 
<br>
and the previous studies (there have indeed been previous studies of low 
<br>
carb diets) is that for some reason, people on these diets tend to 
<br>
naturally consume fewer calories. If further studies of low(er) carb 
<br>
diets continue to show no real negative effects on health, then it would 
<br>
seem that these kinds of diets should be suggested to obese/overweight 
<br>
individuals who need to lose weight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They seem to refute that macronutrient ratios had any effect.  The weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loss in the beginning of the Atkins diet was due to the consumption of less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total calories.  They concluded that &quot;When the energy content of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy-deficit diet is stable, macronutrient composition does not influence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight loss.&quot;  It appears that equal calories produce equal weight loss no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter what the macronutrient combination is.  This seems to refute the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that different calories contribute to weight gain differently.  It supports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea that reducing total calories is equally effective for weight loss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on high-carb, low-carb, high-fat, low-fat, high-protein, or low-protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diets.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but the &quot;bigger picture&quot; is that low-carb seems to reduce 
<br>
appetite. If so, this IS an effect of the macronutrient ratios.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For LDL (bad) cholesterol, the conventional diet dropped it while the Atkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet increased it.  The difference between the groups lessened toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end of the year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For HDL (good cholesterol), both diets increased it, while the Atkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased it at a higher rate.
</em><br>
<p>Of these two, it is my understanding that HDL is much more important in 
<br>
terms of CVD risk. Also, did they report on other things like Lp(a)? I 
<br>
have also heard that low carb diets tend to lower this.
<br>
<p>Finally, did they report on the breakdown of LDL size? If not, why do 
<br>
these studies continue to use measurements of CVD risk that appear to be 
<br>
from the 1980s? Today, we know there is a much wider array of things to 
<br>
look for that are more important than simple &quot;total cholesterol&quot; 
<br>
measurements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For triglycerides, both diets decreased it.  For some reason, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conventional diet reversed direction and went back up toward the end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They even mentioned that &quot;These data do not demonstrate an effect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; macronutrient composition, independent of weight loss, on insulin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensitivity in obese subjects without diabetes.&quot;  This even implies that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-carb diets are not worse for insulin sensitivity and causing diabetes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the equivalent number of protein or fat calories!  (This had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disclaimer about the study's unreliability, small size, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't lower HDL &amp; higher triglycerides 
<br>
associated risk factors for developing diabetes? It seems to me that if 
<br>
I had to pick one of these diets to help prevent it, I would pick the 
<br>
one that showed the most weight loss, best HDL increase, and lowest 
<br>
triglycerides after one year of testing: low carb.
