</em><br>
<p>Yes I think they would respond that way. However I think Hannity is not
<br>
balanced by Colmes. Unlike Colmes, Hannity is nice-looking, articulate,
<br>
fast-taking and photogenic. Looks to me like Colmes is a punching bag for
<br>
Hannity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if so, who balances O'Reilly?
</em><br>
<p>No one does. And if his guests try to put him in place then he cuts them
<br>
off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unless someone can name another show on Fox hosted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by someone as left- leaning as O'Reilly is right, then I must agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with you. 
</em><br>
<p>We'll be waiting a long time on that one. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't really know what they mean by &quot;News without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spin&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>Mike tells me that I am mistaken about this; that only O'Reilly talks about
<br>
no-spin, but if so then my memory is failing me. I could swear that I've
<br>
seen Hannity and others make similar claims many times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have you seen me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this discussion, or do you expect to see me in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion, take pot shots at the left?
</em><br>
<p>No. Not sure why you ask. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, I don't swallow a bit of this.  There was no way, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, that CBS could have gotten rid of Cronkite and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge network of left-biased reporters around him. 
</em><br>
<p>They would have dumped Cronkite in a heart-beat if the ratings had dropped.
<br>
But the people *loved* Cronkite. 
<br>
<p>Your conspiracy theory is what is hard to swallow. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do you think these apathetic people liberal?  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to be almost completely non-ideological.
</em><br>
<p>Speaking generally, it is a basic fact of society that economically
<br>
challenged people tend to be liberal-minded even if many of them are too
<br>
apathetic to get out and vote. This in fact is the strong suit of the
<br>
democratic party: the key to the party's success is getting those large
<br>
masses of people to vote. Clinton did a fine job of it, and now he even has
<br>
an office in Harlem as a sort of gesture of gratitude to the people got out
<br>
and voted for him. Unfortunately for the Dems, for every under-privileged
<br>
person who votes for a Bill Clinton there are probably a dozen more who
<br>
don't bother. 
<br>
<p>However many of those folks *do* watch the evening news. And Neilson calls
<br>
them on the phone at night to find out what they're watching, and why. (I
<br>
know, because I once long ago had a job making those telephone calls). If
<br>
the people tell Neilson that they like liberal reporters like Walter
<br>
Cronkite then the networks keep giving them liberal reporters like Walter
<br>
Cronkite. Good Neilson ratings sell more advertising which makes more money
<br>
for the network, and it is money that makes the world go 'round.
