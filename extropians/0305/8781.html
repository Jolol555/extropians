<p>Reasonable -- I'd particularly like a reflective surface that

I believe I was a bit more scientific and used a magnifying

</em><br>
<p>I think you are in Eliezer's camp with this comment spike,
<br>
but I still remain less convinced.
<br>
<p>See my reasoning, esp. points 1-5 at the end of this msg.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::XScpV30s-aRg1-DzBC-XCo9-OS9yOBcPd3lO">http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::XScpV30s-aRg1-DzBC-XCo9-OS9yOBcPd3lO</a>
<br>
<p>To make a strong assertion that our galaxy is &quot;dead&quot; you
<br>
have to make a number of other strong assertions.
<br>
<p>E.g.
<br>
a) that stars are the best sources for resources (energy &amp; matter);
<br>
b) that advanced civilizations see any point into &quot;expanding/colonization&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(when anybody with half a computer science education [such as myself] knows
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the speed-of-light limitations dictate that one wants to grow smaller
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*not* larger and so even a really primitive AI would recognize that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interstellar colonization is a stupid idea);
<br>
c) that there aren't ways out of this universe into better universes in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiverse;
<br>
etc., etc.
<br>
<p>And I'm going to state fairly strongly that I don't think
<br>
either you or Eliezer have come close to making these cases
<br>
as far as I'm concerned.  As such -- you cannot assert that
<br>
we are the &quot;first emergent sentience here in this galaxy&quot; (IMO).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there were other intelligences in this galaxy, I am at a loss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to explain why they aren't here by now, as well as everywhere else.
</em><br>
<p>Thats an extremely anthropocentric perspective.  If I were an
<br>
advanced civilization I might go to where I could grow the most
<br>
or I might go to where I could think most productively or
<br>
I might go to where I could survive the longest.
<br>
<p>Just because humans tend to colonize doesn't mean more advanced
<br>
rational species find this an interesting activity.  The argument
<br>
is always made: &quot;well if even one species does it they would
<br>
be all over the galaxy&quot;.  DUH... if a species is capable of
<br>
interstellar travel it is capable of constructing a *LOT*
<br>
of very big telescopes and so it is going to know precisely
<br>
what is &quot;out there&quot; within the limits of speed-of-light
<br>
limitations.  I suspect humans would think several times
<br>
about whether to go colonize a star system 50 light years
<br>
if they discovered even a primitive species 500 light years
<br>
away.  How do you know how they might develop or where
<br>
they may be technologically or how they might have expanded
<br>
into their physical environment in the 500 years (assuming
<br>
0.1c travel speed) it is going to take you to get to the
<br>
system you want to colonize.
<br>
<p>An interstellar colonization mission presumably isn't
<br>
something one undertakes lightly and one is going to
<br>
want to believe fairly strongly that it *will* be successful.
<br>
<p>Do your associates at Lockheed simply throw up a satellite
<br>
with an attitude of &quot;Lets go for it -- maybe it will work
<br>
out...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we do not yet recognize ETI because we do not know what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks like.
</em><br>
<p>This I agree with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do let us mercifully spare the next emergent ETI this puzzle by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting to its star and being there waiting for it to emerge.
</em><br>
<p>You are assuming that stars are the destinations of choice
<br>
and I think that is open to significant discussion.
<br>
