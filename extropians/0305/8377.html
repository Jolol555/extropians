Damien writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I remember reading of a study a few years ago trying to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regression on political positions, and finding that a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chunk, maybe a majority, of the variance could be explained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a single dimension, giving some support to the traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I would have been astonished (and not a little skeptical)
<br>
if the study had concluded differently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OTOH, it wasn't an overwhelming majority -- 60%, maybe? --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving a lot of room for fuzziness and error.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OTGrippingH, there is at least one psych experiment where a group of people is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; split up randomly with each person being assigned one of two labels; the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly artificial and baseless tribes then start exhibiting distressingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribal behavior.  To me this suggest that just because we see humans cluster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needn't mean there's a coherent reason for the clustering.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, but in the case of political differences, the clustering
<br>
we see is real (as per your previous point).  The only tragedy would
<br>
be if people did *not* think independently about new issues.  As you
<br>
go on to write,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And so we find things like war on drugs cutting across the spectrum, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defectors from both of the main sides, as I've said.  And both sides get their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; litmus issues, and look oddly at someone who tries to hang out but disagrees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with something, like gun control.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'm sure that we've all experienced that.  Years ago
<br>
I was the only libertarian I knew who favored a military
<br>
draft (I had not yet understood that the U.S. isn't really
<br>
a nation).  And as early as 1970, neither my father nor I
<br>
had the slightest clue as to why most all the other 
<br>
conservatives were getting excited by abortion.
<br>
<p>So, so long as the clustering is not showing the unfortunate symptoms
<br>
claimed in that psych experiment (which I'm also a little skeptical
<br>
of), then no harm is done.  Worse by far is polarization, which
<br>
manifests conservatives being quiet about certain outrages because
<br>
they can count on the liberals to be outraged, and vice versa.
