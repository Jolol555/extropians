Subject: Moving vs. Copying (was Status of Superrationality)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Eliezer writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ### But isn't it the same as the totalist position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The totalist position says it is better to copy than to move.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whereas I think that maybe we discussed this before, I still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot understand why you would rather move than copy.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to perhaps gain some insight, let me formulate a thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment to find out your feelings on the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that on one bright and cheery morning, Eliezer is having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extremely good time.  This is mainly (let us say) due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a commendable excess of serotonin operating in his CNS, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may also be due to having had a number of good breaks lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let us further suppose that there are two delightful problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work on, A and B, both of which promise nice advances in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the theory of AI friendliness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now Eliezer finds that A is slightly more fun and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly more promising than B, but so delightful and promising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are both choices that he hesitates in choosing.  Now to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on A, however, involves going to another office in another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are we to assume that you would copy---instead of move---but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so only because you are making a sacrifice for the sake of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity?  Namely, by getting to work on both A and B, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course advance the cause of the Singularity (thus alleviating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much pain and suffering in the world), but at some cost to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself.  The cost to yourself---if I have understood you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly---is that it would be better for you to have moved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than copied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To place myself in a parallel situation, suppose that Lee has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two hours free at some particular time T in which to watch a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great movie.  Even better, there are two movies A and B that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be almost equally pleasurable to watch.  Well, what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would do, of course, (being a totalist) is make a copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself for the interval of time (T, T+2hrs) and watch both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movies.  (We are not talking about any events subsequent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; T+2hrs, and I hope that no one is distracted by such considerations.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why shouldn't I get to watch both movies, and enjoy both, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why isn't this the best course of action for one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### You are pointing to a very important feature of human motivation
<br>
system - non-linearity.
<br>
<p>Both the averagist and totalist positions are crude approximations of our
<br>
largely inborn motivational hardware. In real life we have a very strong
<br>
negative response to a set of evolutionarily specified stimuli, or a certain
<br>
level of resources available to us - insufficient nutrition, physical pain,
<br>
and other signals of near-term danger are weighted much more heavily in our
<br>
decisions than time-discounted signals of danger, or, on the other hand,
<br>
signals of available opportunity. Our avoidance system is *not* the same as
<br>
our pursuit system (neurologically exemplified by, but not limited to, the
<br>
amygdala vs. nucleus accumbens). This is why most of us will not leave our
<br>
copy in Hell (averagism), but would consider leaving a copy in a second-rate
<br>
heaven (totalism), especially if the copy still has the chance to improve
<br>
its lot. Since there are interindividual variations in empathy, and
<br>
time-discounting of rewards, there will be many versions of ethics, such as
<br>
the threaded ethics, and hardly any pure totalists or pure averagists.
<br>
<p>I am a non-linear totalist-volitionist, BTW.
