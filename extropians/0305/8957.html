Regarding the question of whether different altruists could have differnet
<br>
goals, Wei wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the totalist and the averagist do not have the same goals. One wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to maximize total happiness, and the other wants to maximize average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness.
</em><br>
<p>A couple of comments on this.  First, I think it was Wei himself who
<br>
pointed out to me a few years ago that the &quot;averagist&quot; philosophy is
<br>
internally inconsistent.  This is the view that we should maximize
<br>
the average happiness of human beings, i.e. the sum of all happiness
<br>
divided by the number of people.  The problem is that half the people
<br>
are of below average happiness, hence they are dragging down the curve.
<br>
By killing off the less happy half of the human race, we can greatly
<br>
increase average happiness, hence this is an acceptable goal for the
<br>
averagist.  However it does not stop there, for having done so, the
<br>
remaining half can once again be divided in to the more and less happy,
<br>
and we can justify killing off the less happy half of the remainder.
<br>
This is repeated until only one person is left, the single happiest
<br>
individual of the entire human race, who probably has something wrong
<br>
with him.
<br>
<p>I think that totalism is also flawed, as there is no absolute scale on
<br>
which to measure happiness.  Decision theory shows that utility scales
<br>
are arbitrary up to (at least) a linear transformation.  That means
<br>
that we can't tell whether a person has a net positive or a net negative
<br>
happiness.  If we measure happiness on a scale from 1-10 then it's always
<br>
positive.  If we measure it from -10 to 10 it might be negative.  I would
<br>
argue that there is no meaningful answer to the question of whether a
<br>
given person's net happiness contributes positively or negatively to
<br>
the total for the whole human race.  And of course this leaves aside
<br>
the whole problem of inter-personal comparisons of utility.
<br>
<p>Now, these are rather simplistic analyses.  In practice, altruists
<br>
probably have different degrees of weighting which they would apply to
<br>
the happiness of people and the total number of people.  I believe that
<br>
virtually all altruists will have a degree of uncertainty about whether
<br>
a given increment in the number of people is balanced by a decrement in
<br>
average happiness, or vice versa.
<br>
<p>Based on this uncertainty, I still think it is possible that altruists
<br>
actually do agree on their goals, but disagree on how to get there.
<br>
The issues of how to balance different people's levels of happiness,
<br>
as well as how to weight the total number of people, are questions of
<br>
tactics and not fundamental goals.  The goal is to maximize the happiness
<br>
of the human race.  Philosophical, scientific and pragmatic uncertainty
<br>
makes it hard to know how best to achieve that goal.  From these areas
<br>
of uncertainty arise the disagreements among altruists about the best
<br>
course of action.
<br>
<p>I'll send another message discussing the &quot;inability to disagree&quot; results.
<br>
