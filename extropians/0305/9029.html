<p>Yep, there's an article in today's issue of Science (paid link unfortunately
<br>
but I'll dig out the pdfs if anyone wants them) that says
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;...more equine clones are in the works. Katrin Hinrichs of Texas
<br>
A&amp;M University in College station says &quot;We're hoping to have the first
<br>
horse.&quot; Her group have a mare almost halfway through the gestation
<br>
period with a clone. But the Italians may win this horserace. Cesare
<br>
Galli of the Laboratory of Reproductive Technology in Cremona says
<br>
his group has a cloned foal due in May.
<br>
<p>&quot;But don't expect to see a clone of Funny Cide, the gelding that is
<br>
bidding to become a Triple Crown winner. The Thoroughbreds'
<br>
Jockey Club doesn't even allow artificial insemination much less
<br>
cloning.&quot;
<br>
<p>That said, technically, the &quot;know-how&quot; to produce a clone of a horse
<br>
(gelding or otherwise) would now be there as the method for
<br>
producing a mule (an equine) has been worked out.
<br>
<p>I think a cloned gelding would be likely to disappoint though. Clones
<br>
are *not* identical - environment counts. And being gelded is likely
<br>
to be a significant &quot;environmental factor&quot;. In fact don't they
<br>
specifically geld some horses to settle them for racing?
