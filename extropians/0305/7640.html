Harvey pointed out a distinction between name-calling and ad hominem:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;John K Clark wrote,
<br>
<em>  &gt; I demonstrate to the best of my ability that topic A is
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; untrue, I sincerely believe that it is idiotic to believe
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; topic A, Mr.X nevertheless believes in topic A, I call
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; Mr. X an idiot. I have addressed the topic and I don't
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; see where the fraud and deception is, after all,
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; believing in idiotic things is what idiots do.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ad hominem in your example.  You are merely name-calling.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ad hominem would have been if you DIDN'T demonstrate that topic A is untrue.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If, instead, you merely asserted that because Mr. X is an idiot, we know his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;claim about topic A is untrue, that would have been ad hominem.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;See the difference?  Name-calling is not the same as ad hominem.  Ad hominem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is name-calling instead of refuting the evidence.  If you refute the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence correctly and then call the person names, that is not ad hominem.
<br>
<p>But there is an interesting discussion of what &quot;ad hominem&quot; is evolving
<br>
into at <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ad%20hominem">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ad%20hominem</a>
<br>
<p>Is it really useful to attempt anymore to distinguish between 
<br>
name-calling and ad hominem?
<br>
<p>As dictionary.com wrote:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase now chiefly describes an argument based on the failings
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of an adversary rather than on the merits of the case: Ad hominem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attacks on one's opponent are a tried-and-true strategy for people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who have a case that is weak.  Ninety percent of the Panel finds
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this sentence acceptable.
<br>
<p>;-) One wonders if &quot;the Panel&quot; also agreed with this sentence!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression now also has a looser use in referring to any personal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attack, whether or not it is part of an argument, as in &quot;It isn't in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the best interests of the nation for the press to attack him in this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal, ad hominem way.&quot;  This use is acceptable to 65 percent of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Panel.
<br>
<p>In any case, it certainly strikes me that people resort to saying
<br>
that their adversaries don't reason well, or are stupid, or uneducated,
<br>
or mean-spirited when their arguments are weak.
<br>
<p>Vastly more complicated is whether or not to call someone a fascist,
<br>
or unpatriotic, or anti-American, or a communist, or a jingoist, an
<br>
imperialist, etc., because those are not empty of meaning.
<br>
<p>My working hypothesis:  if the target would not agree that the term
<br>
describes him or her, then usage of the term *MUST* be accompanied
<br>
by analytical argument attempting to make the case.
