[...in flies at least. Motor neuron degeneration is known to limit maximum
<br>
fly longevity. By comparison cancer is the main limiting factor in
<br>
rodents, but not in humans. (Only 4% of human centenarians die of
<br>
cancer.) In humans atherosclerosis is the main limiting factor, with
<br>
declines in immunity playing a secondary role. These two factors may be
<br>
connected... There may exist no general theory of aging at all. Instead
<br>
the nature of &quot;aging&quot; may vary for different species.)]

<p>Effects of overexpression of Cu-Zn and Mn superoxide dismutases, catalase
<br>
and thioredoxin reductase genes on longevity in Drosophila melanogaster.
<br>
<p>The overexpression of antioxidative enzymes such as Cu-Zn superoxide
<br>
dismutase (SOD), Mn SOD and catalase has previously been reported to
<br>
extend life span in transgenic flies (Drosophila melanogaster). The
<br>
purpose of the present study was to determine whether life-extending
<br>
effects persist if the recipient control strains of flies are relatively
<br>
long-lived. Accordingly, the life spans of large numbers of replicate
<br>
control and overexpressor lines were determined in two long-lived genetic
<br>
backgrounds, involving a combined total of more than 90 000 flies.
<br>
Significant increases in the activities of both Cu-Zn SOD and catalase had
<br>
no beneficial effect on survivorship in relatively long-lived y w mutant
<br>
flies, and were associated with slightly decreased life spans in wild
<br>
type flies of the Oregon-R strain. The introduction of additional
<br>
transgenes encoding Mn SOD or thioredoxin reductase in the same genetic
<br>
background also failed to cause life span extension. In conjunction with
<br>
data from earlier studies, the results show that increasing the
<br>
activities of these major antioxidative enzymes above wild type levels
<br>
does not decrease the rate of aging in long-lived strains of Drosophila,
<br>
although there may be some effect in relatively short-lived strains.
