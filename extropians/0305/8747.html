<p><p>MIT, Army open nanotech center. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology
<br>
and the U.S. Army formally unveiled the Institute for Soldier
<br>
Nanotechnologies, which is geared toward creating battlefield armor for the
<br>
21st century. MIT on Thursday cut the ribbon on the nanotechnology
<br>
institute, which was funded by a $50 million grant from the Army in 2002.
<br>
Corporations including Dow Corning, DuPont, Raytheon and Carbon
<br>
Nanotechnologies are participating in the center's development. In all,
<br>
private companies have invested $40 million in the center. The center's
<br>
research can largely be characterized as chemistry in action. During a
<br>
ceremony held at the university on Thursday, researchers showed off a
<br>
technique for applying new types of coatings to fabrics to make them more
<br>
resistant to water or capable of killing bacteria.
<br>
Other projects involve developing fabrics that will contract or expand like
<br>
an accordion when exposed to electricity; these materials could potentially
<br>
be used for in-field medical devices such as tourniquets. (CNet 5/23/03)

<p>Nanotech funding shifts to policy arena. The nascent nanotechnology industry
<br>
needs to start playing by the same public-policy rules as other
<br>
government-funded technology programs, the former chairman of the House
<br>
Science Committee told the Nanobusiness 2003 conference here on Tuesday (May
<br>
13). Former congressman Robert Walker, now a Washington lobbyist, reminded
<br>
conferees that federal funding for nanotechnology research is close to final
<br>
approval in Congress. &quot;You are real, the House just passed the
<br>
nanotechnology funding bill,&quot; Walker told about 150 executives. &quot;Now you
<br>
need to play in the public policy arena.&quot; (EETimes 5/13/03)

<br>
<p>Souped-up Superconductivity. For materials that carry electricity without
<br>
resistance, a little nanotechnology turns a major turnoff into a turn-on,
<br>
says a team of researchers. Ordinarily, a magnetic field quashes the
<br>
currents flowing freely through a superconductor. But when decked out in
<br>
tiny magnetic dots, a superconductor may behave just the opposite way and
<br>
carry electricity freely only when exposed to a magnetic field, the team
<br>
reports in the 16 May PRL. Their technique might someday boost the
<br>
current-carrying capacity of superconducting wires, or set the bits in
<br>
quantum computers.

<p>Nanotube Network to Simulate Brain Structures. NASA researchers have
<br>
developed a way to grow miniscule networks of carbon nanotubes that are
<br>
similar to brain synapses, in the hope of building smarter and more reliable
<br>
computers. The lead scientist for the project, Deepak Srivastava, used
<br>
computer simulation to build a network of carbon nanotubes that look and
<br>
behave like the small spaces between nerve cells called synapses through
<br>
which nerve impulses travel.

<p>Gallium nitride makes for a new kind of nanotube. To the growing list of
<br>
nanosized objects created in a laboratory you can now add nanotubes
<br>
synthesized from the prized semiconductor gallium nitride. A team of
<br>
Berkeley Lab scientists has created gallium nitride nanotubes with diameters
<br>
ranging between 30 to 200 nanometers. By comparison, a human hair has a
<br>
diameter of about 100,000 nanometers. &quot;These gallium nitride nanotubes are
<br>
electronically and optically active and, because they're made from single
<br>
crystals, exceptionally durable and uniform in their properties,&quot; says
<br>
Peidong Yang, a chemist with Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division and
<br>
a professor with UC Berkeley's Chemistry Department who led this research.
<br>
&quot;They offer a wide range of opportunities for technological applications.&quot;

<p>When is a metal not a metal? The May 23 issue of the journal Science answers
<br>
that question with an account of the surprising behavior exhibited by
<br>
nanometer-scale clusters of the metal niobium. When the clusters are cooled
<br>
to below 20 degrees Kelvin, electrical charges in them suddenly shift,
<br>
creating structures known as dipoles. (EurekAlert 5/22/03)

<p>Turning Bubbles into Microscopic Syringes. Turning bubbles into microscopic
<br>
syringes through the use of sound has been experimentally shown by
<br>
researchers in the Netherlands (Claus-Dieter Ohl, University of Twente,
<br>
011-31-53-489-5604), demonstrating a potential method for injecting drugs
<br>
and genes into specific regions of a patient's body. Taking high-speed
<br>
microscopic photographs, the researchers revealed that even bubbles much
<br>
smaller than the thickness of a human hair could transform into a
<br>
needle-like tube, delivering a billionth of a millionth of a gallon of
<br>
liquid. While this sub-nanofluidic volume seems very small, it is more than
<br>
enough to transfer large molecules (such as DNA and most drugs) into desired
<br>
cells for medical therapy. (Physics News Update 5/14/03)

<p>Physicists Measure Individual Electrons In Real Time. Ultracold Experiment
<br>
Opens Door for Basic Studies in Quantum Computing. Physicists at Rice
<br>
University have completed the first real-time measurement of individual

electrons, creating an experimental method that for the first time allows
<br>
scientists to probe the dynamic interactions between the smallest atomic
<br>
particles. The research, which appears in the May 22 issue of the journal

revolutionary type of computer that is orders of magnitude more powerful
<br>
than any computer ever built.

<p>Berkeley Lab scientists determine electrical properties of carbon-60
<br>
molecular layer. Using some of the world's most advanced photoelectron
<br>
spectroscopy and computing techniques, Berkeley Lab scientists gained a more
<br>
precise understanding of the electrical properties of fullerenes, those
<br>
famous soccer-ball-shaped molecules comprised of 60 carbon atoms. The team,
<br>
which also includes researchers from Stanford University and Europe,
<br>
obtained the first experimental measurement of the range of energies
<br>
possessed by electrons, as a function of their momenta, in a single layer of
<br>
carbon-60 molecules doped with additional electrons, a step that transforms
<br>
the molecule into one of the best known superconductors, meaning it conducts
<br>
electricity without resistance below a certain critical temperature.

electron emission current density of at least 15 Amps/cm2 using a gated
<br>
carbon nanotube electron source. These high current density levels were

<p>Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe develops nano-structured material for hydrogen
<br>
storage. The car of the future will use a fuel cell and will be refuelled
<br>
with hydrogen. Unfortunately, such a refuelling process lasts more than one
<br>
hour with most of today's technology. But now researchers of the
<br>
Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (research centre Karlsruhe, Germany) have made
<br>
an important step on the way to a better hydrogen storage system. With
<br>
custom-made nano-particles, researchers reckon they could reduce the
<br>
refuelling time to a few minutes. To improve the storage process, the
<br>
research team used nano-technology. With custom-made catalysts made from so
<br>
called titanium nano-clusters, the researchers at the Institute for
<br>
nano-technology shortened the refuelling times of today's hydrogen tank
<br>
material to 7-8 minutes. (Fuel Cell Today 5/23/03)

<p>Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe Discovers Nanostructured Material that Directly
<br>
Converts Electric into Mechanical Energy. Muscles of metal for miniaturized
<br>
robots or small prostheses - this is one of the visions that may become true
<br>
by a discovery made by the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe. Scientists have
<br>
developed a novel nanoporous metal that expands reversibly when an electric
<br>
voltage is applied. In this way, electric energy can be converted directly
<br>
into mechanical energy. For the first time worldwide, macroscopically
<br>
measurable length changes have thus been induced in a metal by application
<br>
of low electric voltages. This breakthrough allows various
<br>
microtechnological components to be conceived, the industrial property
<br>
rights of which have been applied for in the meantime: Switches and
<br>
controls, direct voltage indicators or other sensors, actuators, and - by
<br>
making use of the reverse effect - motion transducers. (Forschungszentrum
