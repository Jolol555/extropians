Claims of the anti-war Left+ Euro leaders + Islamists in the last 120 days:
<br>
<p>1) 200-300 Thousand Iraqi civilian deaths incurred from a US invasion, from a 
<br>
UN paper, as quoted by such foreign policy geniuses like Jeanine Garafalo and 
<br>
Susan Sarandon.
<br>
<p>2) Massive US military casualties from Iraqi gas and bio attacks.
<br>
<p>3) Massive violent attacks by the &quot;Arab street&quot; globally, as a result of the 
<br>
US going in.
<br>
<p>4) Massive resistance by fanatical Special Rep Guards, another Vietnam, 
<br>
America hopelessly bogged-down.
<br>
<p>5) The American economy ruined by a phryic victory
<br>
<p>6) The linning up of the entire world against the US, forming an Islamic 
<br>
coalition, etc.
<br>
<p>7) The ransacking of &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of ancient archeological 
<br>
treasures by crazed mobs, And this too turned out to be a gross exaggeration 
<br>
spun out by the world press.
<br>
<p>So far, the Prez's opponents are 0 for 7. We'll see if the purported anthrax 
<br>
and sarin turn up anywhere. Right now there is interesting evidence of 
<br>
Saddam's complicity with Al Qeida, that has turned up as well as accusations 
<br>
in the London Telegraph of a Labor politician on the take from Saddam. Let's 
<br>
see what the ensuing lawsuit proves. Similar to WW2, the first monster to 
<br>
fall was not the worst, Mussolini. We have take out the Mussolini of Islamist 
<br>
Terror. The Tojo of terror, Osama, is still on the run, and the various 
<br>
Hitlers will still need to be dug out. Interestingly enough, in this war, 
<br>
Stalin will remain allied with his sometime pal Hitler, similar to 1940 with 
<br>
the Nazi-Soviet pact. WW1 was the war the undermined European nationalist 
<br>
empires. WW2 was war between fascism and everyone else. WW3 was the Cold War. 
<br>
Now WW4 is the conflict between those engaged in Islamist warfare (and those 
<br>
allied with em) to crush the US.  The struggle continues.
