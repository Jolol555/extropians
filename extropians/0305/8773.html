<p>There is a *lot* of mass, particularly H2 (or ionized forms),
<br>
still left around in gas/dust clouds.  [These clouds can easily
<br>
run to hundreds of stellar masses.]  Clouds recently generated
<br>
via a supernova would be particularly rich in the heavier elements
<br>
one needs for computronium (unless one wants to go to the trouble
<br>
of breeding these elements which might be very time/energy consuming).
<br>
<p>The density of the clouds is low however.  I'm under the impression
<br>
its a few particles per cubic meter (Amara might know better).
<br>
So I personally could never think of an efficient way to
<br>
concentrate the material but that doesn't mean one doesn't exist.
<br>
I've never studied the physics of Bussard collectors (Star
<br>
Trek deflectors?) or whether recent progress in space
<br>
technologies (e.g. R.M. Winglee's magnetospheric plasma
<br>
propulsion) might be applied creatively to allow the
<br>
matter to be efficiently collected/densified.
<br>
<p>If it turns out that harvesting material that is in &quot;free&quot; space
<br>
is cheaper than lifting it out of stellar gravity wells then that
<br>
does seem like a *much* better evolutionary strategy (Spike &amp; Damien --
<br>
there are some opportunities here for some really creative thinking --
<br>
just *how* big of a collector could one create?  Does it have
<br>
to be physical, magnetic, etc.?  What would a civilization or
<br>
computational architecture built around this look like?)
<br>
<p>The fact that a fully evolved star based MBrain (one that uses
<br>
an &quot;unmanaged&quot; star as a power source) may be up to several
<br>
light years in size does begin to raise the question of
<br>
whether or not we have been thinking about this incorrectly
<br>
because the scales we typically think in are meters instead
<br>
of AU?  Just as we never understood what nanotech allowed
<br>
(until Feynman/Drexler looked closely at it) because we
<br>
didn't think about things in terms of nm scales -- might we
<br>
perhaps be missing the boat in terms what advanced civilizations
<br>
look like, the Fermi Paradox, etc. because we aren't
<br>
thinking *big* enough?
<br>
<p>If these thoughts are correct, and galactic gas cloud material
<br>
harvesting is much &quot;cheaper&quot; than star-lifting (or other methods
<br>
to get resources out of stellar gravity wells), then the stars will
<br>
stay &quot;on&quot; until all such clouds have been depleted.
<br>
<p>So the explanation for the Fermi Paradox then becomes what
<br>
&quot;SI&quot; in their right mind would possibly want to use a star as
<br>
a source for resources (unless it happened to live in a very
<br>
impoverished part of the galaxy from the perspective of
<br>
atomic/molecular clouds)?  Then the entire W. I. Newman &amp;
<br>
C. Sagan ideas about &quot;interstellar diffusion&quot; become
<br>
entirely based on an extremely anthropocentric perspective.
<br>
As civilizations evolve, they *don't* migrate to the stars,
<br>
they *do* migrate to the clouds.
<br>
<p>We could take this a little bit further.  As has been discussed
<br>
on the list (and written about by Seth Lloyd and probably others),
<br>
black holes make great power sources.  So the &quot;advanced civilization&quot;
<br>
bias on where to travel might be (1) A black hole with lots of
<br>
matter to throw into it; (2) Large easily harvested matter clouds
<br>
(preferably those enriched with heavier elements); (3) Someplace
<br>
rich in brown dwarfs (because they have more matter in minimal
<br>
gravity wells); (4) Someplace where one or more stars is about
<br>
to go supernova (because if one can solve the radiation damage
<br>
problem to ones nanotech [which is probably possible because
<br>
its a redundancy issue] then such locations aren't bad because
<br>
they are solving the &quot;removal of the material from the gravity well&quot;
<br>
problem without having to construct any of the star-lifting
<br>
equipment; (5) Lastly, typical star systems where one has to
<br>
ultimately do all of the back-breaking work of doing the
<br>
star-lifting to reduce the damn thing to something that
<br>
will last a trillion or more years (or as Eliezer would
<br>
probably prefer to stop unmanaged fusion processes entirely
<br>
so less of the potential energy is wasted).
