Ron h. inquired:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Spudboy,
<br>
       Could someone help me with this.  In the real late 50s and the 60s the 
<br>
engineering magazines used to run many stories about developmental and 
<br>
exploratory work being done to develop deep sea mining.  According to the 
<br>
magazines there was ready access to metals on the ocean floor but we had to 
<br>
develop the techniques for harvesting the metals.
<br>
       One day I noticed that interest had dried up.  I asked around and was 
<br>
told that it was the UN Treaty that had killed the interest.  If companies 
<br>
had to divvy up with the UN and all the nations of the world they weren't 
<br>
interested -- there wasn't enough profit to share with everyone.
<br>
       Does anyone know the full story?
<br>
Ron h.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My take is that if there was a profit to be justified, no UN treaty would 
<br>
stand in the way of the hunger for profit. I believe that back in the 60's 
<br>
and 70's there was the expectation that manganese nodules and such were going 
<br>
to be in great demand, for the later 20th century. In truth, other sources 
<br>
for raw materials have been found, demand has shifted to plastic parts for 
<br>
auto bodies, especially. The hunt for oil and perhaps natural gas and gas 
<br>
hydrates is the motivator that drives this interest today, not metals. Oil 
<br>
and natural gas is the mantra we need to be chanting to comprehend this 
<br>
phase.
