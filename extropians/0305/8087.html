<p><em>&gt; Plus, it's odd to think of us spreading democracy abroad while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil liberties are eroded at home and people want to make the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving people too much protection against government snooping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is happening on the home front in the US is *much* more 
<br>
dangerous than terrorism ever was.   We must get and keep oversight 
<br>
of our supposed &quot;public servants&quot;.   We must make our fundamental 
<br>
civil liberties truly fundamental and not subject to government 
<br>
forfeiture.   We must end the false notion that Constitutional 
<br>
guarantees are automatically suspended during &quot;a time of war&quot;, 
<br>
especially when it is not Constitutionally such a time at all.  It is 
<br>
not Constitutional to suspend the Bill of Rights in any circumstances 
<br>
short of a declared full national emergency and declaring that is not 
<br>
a casual process for damn good reasons.    We must as a people stop 
<br>
putting the noose the government hands us around our necks whenever 
<br>
the government waves its hands and mumbles &quot;national security&quot;.   
<br>
<p>If we want to retain enough freedom to build an extropian future at 
<br>
all we must take these things very seriously.   If we are determined 
<br>
to build/reach a much more extropian future we must limit the power 
<br>
of the State to control technological investigation and development. 
<br>
Failing that we must make and keep room to act contrary to State 
<br>
decisions when necessary.    The alternative is relinqushment of the 
<br>
future to whatever &quot;the people&quot; decide.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So, it's still possible that the net effect of the war could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive. There's still room for a royal fuckup too.  And I'm still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voting Democratic in 2004.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If the net is positive it will be sheer dumb luck and I will eat my 
<br>
hat.  The net effect of the increasingly all-powerful State 
<br>
domestically and increased secrecy and removal of oversight of said 
<br>
State cannot be other than a very dangerous loss of freedom.   
<br>
<p>I don't know how I will vote.  The Democrats have not stood up once 
<br>
for freedom and liberty agains the Bush administration's domestic 
<br>
policies.   I don't know what has them that cowed but I have no 
<br>
reason to expect they will bring us back to some sanity.    I had to 
<br>
vote just to defeat an existing evil by picking a perhaps slightly 
<br>
less evil one.
