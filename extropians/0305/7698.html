This study looks at the effects on colon and rectal cancer of fruits,
<br>
vegetables and grains. The researchers suggest that, in women, the
<br>
consumption of grains actually blocks some of the cancer-protective effects
<br>
of fruits and vegetables.

<p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
Plant foods and differences between colon and rectal cancers.

<br>
A case-control study on plant food intake and its role in the risk of colon
<br>
and rectal cancers was carried out in Montevideo, Uruguay. Four hundred and
<br>
eighty-four (484) cases of colorectal cancer and 1452 controls were
<br>
frequency matched on age, sex, residence and urban/rural status. Among
<br>
cases, 260 patients had colon cancer whereas 224 had rectal tumours.
<br>
Controls had non-neoplastic conditions. Both cases and controls were
<br>
interviewed in the four major hospitals in Montevideo shortly after
<br>
admittance for diagnosis or treatment. The questionnaire included a section
<br>
on frequency of foods, which included 64 items, in particular, queries on 18
<br>
vegetables, 10 fruits and 6 cereal dishes were included. Thus, the amount of
<br>
plant foods consumed was complete and included the main plant foods in the
<br>
Uruguayan diet. The analysis showed that rectal cancer displayed inverse
<br>
associations with total plant foods, total vegetables, cooked vegetables,
<br>
potatoes and legumes. When data were stratified by tumour site and sex, only
<br>
men showed a protective effect of plant foods (odds ratio (OR) of rectal
<br>
cancer for men 0.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.7). In contrast,
<br>
women with rectal carcinoma were not associated with plant food intake. It
<br>
can be concluded that plant foods are protective factors for men afflicted
<br>
with colorectal cancer but that plant food intake is not associated with
<br>
risk in women. This is, at least in part, due to the high risk associated
<br>
with bread intake in this gender.
