<p><em>&gt; &gt; To place myself in a parallel situation, suppose that Lee has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; two hours free at some particular time T in which to watch a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; great movie.  Even better, there are two movies A and B that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be almost equally pleasurable to watch.  Well, what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would do, of course, (being a totalist) is make a copy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; myself for the interval of time (T, T+2hrs) and watch both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; movies.  (We are not talking about any events subsequent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; T+2hrs, and I hope that no one is distracted by such considerations.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why shouldn't I get to watch both movies, and enjoy both, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why isn't this the best course of action for one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You are pointing to a very important feature of human motivation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system - non-linearity.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by the term &quot;non-linear&quot;, although
<br>
I do give a guess below.  Correct me if it's wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Both the averagist and totalist positions are crude approximations of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely inborn motivational hardware. In real life we have a very strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative response to a set of evolutionarily specified stimuli, or a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of resources available to us - insufficient nutrition, physical pain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other signals of near-term danger are weighted much more heavily in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions than time-discounted signals of danger, or, on the other hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals of available opportunity.
</em><br>
<p>All right.  So this is what you mean by &quot;non-linearity&quot;:  Intuitively,
<br>
a small change in the stimulus results in an unexpectedly large change
<br>
in the response---unexpected, that is, because as we've been plotting
<br>
or following the result, and we in our extrapolations are surprised by
<br>
the intensity of the response.  That is what you mean, isn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our avoidance system is *not* the same as our pursuit system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (neurologically exemplified by, but not limited to, the amygdala
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. nucleus accumbens).
</em><br>
<p>That makes sense and seems reasonable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is why most of us will not leave our copy in Hell (averagism),
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but of course, totalists won't either (not that you 
<br>
have said they would in so many words).  We totalists
<br>
would look upon the copy in hell as pulling the total
<br>
happiness, satisfaction, joy, contentment, etc., down.
<br>
<p>And the averagists, in this case, come to the same
<br>
conclusion.
<br>
<p>Now a devout totalist, like myself, will assign a few
<br>
copies to hell provided that an even greater number get
<br>
to go to heaven.  I can do this because logically I can
<br>
force myself to suppose that the benefits of the heaven
<br>
are so unimaginably great that they can more than out-
<br>
weigh the easily imagined torments of hell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but would consider leaving a copy in a second-rate heaven (totalism),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if the copy still has the chance to improve its lot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since there are interindividual variations in empathy, and time-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discounting of rewards, there will be many versions of ethics, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the threaded ethics, and hardly any pure totalists or pure averagists.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think that there are few &quot;pure totalists&quot;.  How do
<br>
I know if I qualify?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am a non-linear totalist-volitionist, BTW.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you would define that a little more clearly (perhaps I
<br>
missed some threads), then perhaps we would agree for once  ;-)
