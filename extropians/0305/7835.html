I can't really say whether it's diet or other environmental features, 
<br>
but chickens that I buy at the store not only have more fat, but have 
<br>
fat which is a much brighter yellow than the chickens that we raised 
<br>
when I lived on a farm.  The chicken fat that I remember was a pale 
<br>
yellow, not a bright almost orange.  What the significance is?  It could 
<br>
be just that the chickens don't have a chance to exercise, or it could 
<br>
be diet, but *something* has changed them within the past 30 years.  (We 
<br>
kept the chickens mainly for eggs, so it could also just be age.)  
<br>
Whatever the cause, modern chickens are different from 30 years ago, 
<br>
much less paleolithic (there's been genetic selection for more eggs 
<br>
during that period, too).
<br>
<p>And the modern cow isn't an aurochs, much less a gazelle or antelope.  
<br>
If you don't know what you're selecting for, it can be quite difficult 
<br>
to head for it.  So what you need is some independant way of measuring 
<br>
your distance from your goal.  If you are in favor of the &quot;paleolithic&quot; 
<br>
diet because it's healthy, then measure health as you alter your diet in 
<br>
theoretically reasonable ways... but just altering your diet on the 
<br>
basis of theory is of dubious value.  There are too many variables.
