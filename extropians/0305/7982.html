<p><em>&gt; -----Original Message-----

<em>&gt; [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20Hunting">owner-extropians@extropy.org</a>] On Behalf Of Mike Lorrey
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a rather inane and meaningless question. First off 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are these rather unsupported assumptions that hunters:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) are able to objectively determine which are 'the strongest deer'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) are so blessed with deer encounters that they can pick and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose which one to shoot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) gain some benefit from shooting 'the strongest deer', 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among others...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since it seems I am the only actual deer hunter who is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participating in this discussion, and likely know far more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other deer hunters than all others on this list combined, 
</em><br>
<p>The former is likely true, but I can probably stand as the example that
<br>
at least challenges the latter :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll tell you what motivates deer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) there is a deer to shoot at. Many hunters go for years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without spotting even one deer. With 'bucks only' hunting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seasons, the odds are that most deer a hunter encounters are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not legal targets, since they tend to breed more does than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bucks. While deer populations are generally higher due to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wildlife management than even during colonial times, deer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have evolved, due to hunting pressures, to be far smarter and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sensitive than their ancestors.
</em><br>
<p>This comes from an East Coast woods-hunter.  In Texas, it's a LOT
<br>
different.  We've got basically two huge, rich habitats for deer hunting
<br>
(that cover well over 3/4 of the state) and both are so utterly infested
<br>
with deer that even the least talented hunters get to be -- and most
<br>
definitely ARE -- &quot;choosy.&quot;  The simple fact of the matter is that
<br>
hunters don't kill nearly enough deer in Texas and they are more or less
<br>
pests in the state from an ecological perspective.  As a result of this
<br>
and the breeding pressure that such a large population entails (pun
<br>
intended, for the cognoscenti), there's a significant culture of
<br>
&quot;trophy&quot; hunting among Texas deer hunters.  People seek out either fine
<br>
specimens from an aesthetic or sporting standpoint, a good source of
<br>
meat (i.e. BIG) or both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) the hunter is able to get a shot at a deer. Deer, being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agile, camouflaged, and many times more sensitive than humans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (they can hear you walking through dry leaves from several 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred yards away, can spot the blue dyes in most clothing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like neon signs, and can smell human body and technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odors from dozens of yards or more away), a hunter rarely has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a few seconds to get a shot off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I have said before, few hunters are so skilled and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talented that they are regularly able to pick and choose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their targets. The sort of hunts you see on the Outdoors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Channel are typically on enclosed game preserves and are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typical of hunting in open wilderness, and the hunters 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depicted are typically the most talented around. The odds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meeting a hunter like this are approximately that of getting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a World Cup soccer player at a pickup game at your local 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; park, perhaps even worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only time I know of that regular hunters have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity to be choosy is if the area they hunt in has a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the hunting season open to shooting does. In such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations, the hunter would seek to shoot the largest doe, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doe which has generally already bred for several seasons and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has therefore already spread whatever positive genetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics she may posess.
</em><br>
<p>The latter is true to an extent, but most hunters in Texas will get a
<br>
buck of some kind if that's what they're after, simply because deer are
<br>
so numerous.  The regulation of the ratio of bucks to does is part of
<br>
the state game management plan, and a subject of constant discussion
<br>
among hunters -- who have an interest in a vital, healthy deer
<br>
population.
<br>
<p>Beyond this there is the significant factor of planned deer breeding
<br>
that is now a major activity in Texas.  Dozens and dozens of programs
<br>
(all that I know of being private) across the state are engaged in
<br>
long-term programs to improve the stock of game animals.  As a result,
<br>
the size and health of the deer taken even by the average hunter in
<br>
Texas has gone up steadily in my lifetime.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This brings my to my last objection to Mr Jordan's rants. Any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deer which he might consider to be a 'trophy' animal is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully mature animal, generally about 5 years old. Such an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal has already reproduced for several seasons and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore whatever beneficial genetic characteristics it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posesses have been spread to the herd already. Thus, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that hunting trophy animals specifically somehow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dilutes the genetic properties of the herd is patently absurd.
</em><br>
<p>BINGO!  This fundamental truism is based on the confluence of
<br>
game-animal breeding behavior and hunter psychology, plus the more
<br>
recent programs of intentional herd management.  There are thousands of
<br>
pages written about this every year in the hunting press, with lots of
<br>
fine gradations of opinion, but the core dynamic is well understood.  By
<br>
the time an animal has become &quot;trophy-class,&quot; he's spread his genes
<br>
around a LOT.  Harvesting him at that point actually then adds to the
<br>
genetic diversity of the overall herd pool.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Because it is so opportunistic, evolution causes the stupid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals to be preyed, thus creating selective pressure for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>No question about that.  I'm a far better hunter now than I was 20 years
<br>
ago, but the deer are DEFINITELY smarter, bigger and faster!
