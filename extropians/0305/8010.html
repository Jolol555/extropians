<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - A Menlo Park man accused of barking at a police
<br>
canine...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faces a misdemeanor charge that he willfully and maliciously interfered
<br>
with a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palo Alto police officer's duty by teasing and agitating the officer's
<br>
dog.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dillon, who could face up to a year in county jail and a $1,000 fine if
<br>
convicted,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleaded innocent in a Palo Alto courtroom Tuesday.
<br>
<p>and Harvey says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see the problem.  The guy was an idiot for teasing a police dog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right in front of the policemen.  What did he expect to happen?
</em><br>
<p>The guy's good judgment may or may not be the issue.  Yes, I suppose
<br>
these days everyone should be careful of even glancing at police
<br>
officers---that's right, keep your eyes straight, act as if they
<br>
weren't there.  Because: we are more and more reaching the point,
<br>
via a vast profusion of laws and extremely liberal interpretations
<br>
of those laws, that the cop can hassle and detain you to almost no
<br>
end on any number of pretexts, and there is nothing you can do about
<br>
it.  He knows it, and you know it.
<br>
<p>The defendant's version goes like this (continuing from the URL):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident occurred March 5, on Mardi Gras night, when Dillon,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bartender, and a co-worker were walking in downtown Palo Alto
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and passed a group of officers standing by their patrol cars.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Dillon's attorney, Donald Tasto, the police dog in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the cars was already agitated and barking at other passers-by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when Dillon returned a single &quot;friendly bark&quot;.  Police cited then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released him.
<br>
<p>Of course, if this is true, then this was a *flagrant* abuse of
<br>
authority.  But even if it weren't, and the men began &quot;offending&quot;
<br>
the dog, why didn't the cop or cops go over, stand between them
<br>
and the dog, and yell, &quot;Knock it off!&quot;?   The reason, simply, is
<br>
fear.  This latter approach would fail to inspire fear in citizens
<br>
when dealing with the police.  It's the kind of outdated response
<br>
a police officer might have made in 1903, not 2003.
<br>
<p>Karen writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with you, Harvey. This guy was distracting an officer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (dog officer) away from his duties.  He should be slapped on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wrist.  It is the equivalent of waving a box of donuts under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the officer's (human officer) nose while he is on duty and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letting him bite one.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed.  &quot;Taunting a police officer with a box of donuts&quot; doesn't
<br>
need to be on the statutes for it to be a crime.  For this too
<br>
could be a case of &quot;willfully and maliciously interfering with a
<br>
Palo Alto police officer's duty&quot; and might merit &quot;up to a year in
<br>
county jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted&quot;.

<p>I draw your attention to this excerpt from that superb article:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A free society minimizes the number of bows and curtsies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that a person must perform in daily life... A free society
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has no legal caste system -- no officialdom with its pretexts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to bring everyone else to their knees.&quot;
<br>
<p>There were many other points made by the article that are all too
<br>
relevant today, but this one was especially germane.
