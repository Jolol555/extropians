<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20More%20enthusiasm%20than%20news%20in%20Fox's%20coverage%20of%20war">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes: Because the Justice Department was not acting in the 
<br>
partisan manner that most people would have expected.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or because Ken Starr to that time was not known as a tough lawyer.  Or 
<br>
was he put in there to have someone to gripe about?  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thought was that he was put in as a whipping boy -- it was known 
<br>
that he would play fair.  A man that would remain silent while those 42 lawyers 
<br>
in the White House trashed his good name is not an ogre but he is exactly what 
<br>
was needed.
