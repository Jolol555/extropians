<p><em>&gt; I don't see this at all. I can't imagine a group more pessimistic

</em><br>
<p>This is true *now* but historically was not. In the past most
<br>
socialists/social democrats are big believers in the power of reason and
<br>
science, coupled with political power/planning, to create a perfect or at
<br>
least much better world. See for example J D Bernal, J B S Haldane, Lenin,
<br>
Trotsky, the 'mature' Marx. The current anti-science/technology trend among
<br>
such types has really got going since the 1970s (obviously there are
<br>
precursors such as William Morris). I think it reflects the failure of
<br>
socialism/communism which has enormously disillusioned many people and made
<br>
them shift (in my scenario) from &quot;optimism&quot; to &quot;pessimism&quot;. Hence the
<br>
growing alliance IMO between so called 'rightists' and 'leftists' over such
<br>
things as globalisation, free trade and modern science.
