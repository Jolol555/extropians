Neoconservatives
<br>
<p>PARIS The trouble with American conservatism during most of the 20th 
<br>
century was that it was not particularly intelligent. The Republican 
<br>
Party was and is a business party, anti-intellectual and to a 
<br>
considerable degree xenophobic.
<br>
<p>The radical neoconservatives, who appeared in the 1960s, are the first 
<br>
seriously intelligent movement on the American right since the 19th 
<br>
century. They want to remake the international order under effective 
<br>
U.S. hegemony, destroy America's enemies and cripple or eliminate the 
<br>
United Nations and other institutions making a claim to international 
<br>
jurisdiction.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p><p>The main intellectual influence on the neoconservatives has been the 
<br>
philosopher Leo Strauss, who left Germany in 1938 and taught for many 
<br>
years at the University of Chicago. Several of the neoconservatives 
<br>
studied under him. Wolfowitz and Shulsky took doctorates under him.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>He [Leo Strauss] also argued that Platonic truth is too hard for people 
<br>
to bear, and that the classical appeal to &quot;virtue&quot; as the object of 
<br>
human endeavor is unattainable. Hence it has been necessary to tell lies 
<br>
to people about the nature of political reality. ***An elite recognizes 
<br>
the truth, however, and keeps it to itself. This gives it insight, and 
<br>
implicitly power that others do not possess. This obviously is an 
<br>
important element in Strauss's appeal to America's neoconservatives.***
<br>
<p>[emphasis added -- mwiik]
<br>
<p>The ostensibly hidden truth is that expediency works; there is no 
<br>
certain God to punish wrongdoing; and virtue is unattainable by most 
<br>
people. Machiavelli was right. There is a natural hierarchy of humans, 
<br>
and rulers must restrict free inquiry and exploit the mediocrity and 
<br>
vice of ordinary people so as to keep society in order.
<br>
<p>This is obviously a bleak and anti-utopian philosophy that goes against 
<br>
practically everything Americans want to believe. It contradicts the 
<br>
conventional wisdom of modern democratic society. It also contradicts 
<br>
the neoconservatives' own declared policy ambitions to make the Muslim 
<br>
world democratic and establish a new U.S.-led international order, which 
<br>
are blatantly utopian.&gt;&gt;
