<p>Robert, Eli, I recall the conversation, down to where I was sitting 
<br>
and who else was in the room.  I can assure you Robert, we did
<br>
cover this while you were there.  Melanie Swan was there,
<br>
and several others.  Just after that, I pointed out that
<br>
you are mentioned in the afterword of Damien's book Transcension
<br>
along with Eliezer and some other extropians.  We may have 
<br>
covered the topic in more detail later when you were not there, 
<br>
when I argued that we might have a long period (millions of years 
<br>
perhaps) of sun-burning after we build a first-generation MBrain 
<br>
and before we manage to actually stop the nuclear fusion in the sun.
<br>
<p>The more I think about it however, the more doubts I have
<br>
about my own argument on that.  Eliezer's notion has 
<br>
considerable power: any logical growing AI will naturally
<br>
calculate its theoretical upper bounds, then scramble like hell
<br>
to achieve that level.  This would mean stopping the
<br>
absurd waste of energy pouring out into cold dead space
<br>
from the stars.
