<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I did some more checking on this subject of &quot;fraud.&quot; I'm sure Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; will correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that Wayne LaPierre of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; NRA has no basis for accusing CNN of misrepresenting the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; so-called assault weapons unless he can show that the CNN reporter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; John Zarrella used more powerful ammunition in the banned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; semi-automatic assault weapons than he did in the non-automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; weapons during his comparison of the two classes of weapons in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; original controversial broadcast.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are wrong. Zarella used different TARGETS in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstration, made of different materials, which respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; differently to the same ballistic energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, well, that's basically the same idea as using different ammo --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the charge is that CNN did not make a fair comparison of the kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage the two classes of guns can do. However I thought they used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bulletproof vest in both tests.
</em><br>
<p>They used a wall of concrete blocks for one, and a bulletproof vest in
<br>
the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; THis is the crux of the fraud. There are plenty of rifles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which can carry just as much ammo firing the exact same type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of ammo which are not on the banned list, and which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; semiautomatic just as those on the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm. However that is not necessarily fraud on CNN's part. It could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely be an artifact of poorly written legislation; it looks like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the '94 ban did not cover all the rifles that the authors would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have intended (in fact I'd guess the original legislation was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diluted by politicians responding to pressure from the NRA).
</em><br>
<p>No, the original legislation merely specified a list of features, like
<br>
collapsible stocks, pistol grips, bayonet lugs, detachable magazines,
<br>
and said &quot;You can have any two&quot;. Any firearm which has more than that
<br>
is an 'assault weapon'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also part of the fraud. Zarella implied that the banned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rifles were automatic, i.e. machine guns. There was not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; single machine gun on the list, and in fact, you can still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; buy machine guns legally in most states in the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Implied&quot; is a pretty tough thing to prove in court if it's the basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a fraud allegation. Neither you nor LaPierre actually believe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that CNN stated that the banned weapons are machine guns, so there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't much point in accusing CNN of saying something it didn't say.
</em><br>
<p>Zarella's piece claimed that banned weapons have a higher rate of fire
<br>
(they don't) than non-banned rifles, called them 'automatic weapons',
<br>
and claimed that they only have military uses. All of these claims are
<br>
false and are therefore fraudulent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Being 'banned' is purely a matter of cosmetics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being banned is also a matter of having larger magazines and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semi-automatic firing capacity relative to *some* other weapons
</em><br>
<p>Not true. I can go out and buy legally high capacity magazines for many
<br>
non-banned rifles today, capable of carrying as many as 30 rounds. The
<br>
only non-semi-automatic rifles on the market are bolt action rifles. I
<br>
have two semi-automatics in my own collection, and semi-automatic
<br>
rifles make up the majority of legally owned firearms in the US today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (though if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you're telling me is true, not relative to *all* other weapons).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree that the cosmetics issues are absurd but those are not the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues. If they extend the ban then I would expect them to also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase the list of banned semi-automatic weapons to include those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other weapons that skirted past the '94 ban.
</em><br>
<p>But what would be the new criteria? The criteria that Feinstein is
<br>
using is exclusively an aesthetic judgement that a firearm 'looks
<br>
military'. 
<br>
<p>In the renewal bill, Feinstein is adding some of Henry Waxman's &quot;Sniper
<br>
Weapon&quot; proposals, which will give statute-making authority to the ATF
<br>
to decide what calibers are capable of being used as sniper rounds
<br>
(essentially ANY ammunition that is any good for hunting would
<br>
qualify).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I am not taking sides here. In fact in general I'm on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side. I'm just trying to get the facts straight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think you are backwards here. The ban ends in 04, not 94,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the NRA is not at all upset that the ban is ending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I wrote that confusing paragraph very late at night and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct it in another post. Obviously the NRA does not want the ban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended. The NRA is upset because the GOP might nevertheless extend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the White House has stated that Bush is in favor of extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it and might cave into pressure to do so.
</em><br>
<p>While Bill Frist's Senate probably will, the House has no chance of
<br>
doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Machine guns have NOT been banned since 1934. I own one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somehow it doesn't surprise me to learn that you own a machine gun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However fully automatic weapons do require a special permit, yes?
</em><br>
<p>No. You fill out some tax paperwork and send it in to the ATF with a
<br>
$200 purchase tax. They do a background check. While from a theoretical
<br>
standpoint, it is treated as a permit, it is not from a strictly legal
<br>
sense, since the law is in the tax code, not in the criminal or other
<br>
legal codes. If it is a permit, applying for it is asking permission to
<br>
pay a tax. How logical is that?
