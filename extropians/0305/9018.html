<em>&gt; &gt;Spike just for idle ignoramuses like myself what is the basis

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'm merely curious. Are there applications for this sort of thing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Why Spike, Why?  Brett Paatsch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The topic came up on the Mersenne Search chat group: Guys,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the hell are we doing this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; My notion is that a long list of Mersenne primes could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be used as a gentle deterrence or a weapon of peace for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any extraterrestrial civilizations we might contact.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we reveal our many resources, ET might be tempted to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come here and devour same.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if we transmit a long list of Mersenne primes, (the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same in any base, in any corner of the universe) we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate that not only are we a clever species, we have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer resources to simply waste on foolishness.  This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be easily extrapolated into our having a veritable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firehose of technology.  One would be ill advised to give 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity a reason to turn that firehose upon one. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (nice doggie, niiiice doggie, while backing away slowly.)
</em><br>
<p>Ah the classic &quot;we speak softly but carry a long list of 
<br>
Mersenne primes&quot; deterrent.  Very cunning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gregory Stock made a pitch at Extro4 about the effect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cash prizes on research.  We now have a perfect study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case.  The EFF prize turned out to have little impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I can tell.  The introduction of the Pentium 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had a large impact however.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is interesting to have a quantity that continues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to double in size every 11 seconds for years.  The size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the record largest prime doubles every 11 seconds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on average for long stretches of time (~1 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decimal digit prime discovered on 27 Jan 1997, 2+ million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digit prime discovered 1 June 1999, 4+ million digit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prime discovered 14 November 2001. 
</em><br>
<p>Someone could nearly build a clock on the basis of such
<br>
a consistent phenomenon!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The doubling time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is actually getting shorter, as more people join GIMPS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and CPUs get dramatically faster.  Since we are currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; searching near the 6 million digit mark, the doubling time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is now under 10 seconds.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, never mind, we still have atomic clocks to fall back on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; GIMPS reduces waste.  If your background computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycles are not being used by something, your computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is sitting there 99.9% of the time saying&quot; whatdoIdo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatdoIdo, whatdoIdo... over and over.  If you buy a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newer machine, it asks whatdoIdo much faster.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be WORKING those idle CPUs.    
</em><br>
<p>Damn straight!  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It pleases me to know my idle CPU cycles are being used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to advance science, even if in a kind of trivial way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But not really *that* trivial.  We are making a map of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature here, a universal map.  
</em><br>
<p>And it's ok if our locale is denoted. We've deterred 'em.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't know *for absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure* that the abundance of primes continues to follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logarithm rule for abundance.  How would we know if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysteriously began to thin out once one is way out in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the kilothousand digit primes, beyond our ability to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primeness?
</em><br>
<p>Shudder! 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, the Mersenne primes have that wonderful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shortcut to determine primeness, the Lucas Lehmer algorithm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which allows a primality test to be done millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orders of magnitude more quickly than without it.  In what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other area do you know of that you can even logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use the phrase &quot;millions of orders of magnitude&quot; without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any exaggeration at all? 
</em><br>
<p>Kinda makes one's reproductive potential seem small doesn't it. 
<br>
. 
<br>
<em>&gt; Heres the final thought.  My friend Scott Kurowski 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteered his company's services (irony: it is called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Entropia.com) to organize GIMPS.  One would have to know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scott.  He is the kind of guy who has money magnetism.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If he walks thru a room, currency seems to chase him, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggling to get into his pocket.  A generous person is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he: at the last Mersenne party, he showed up and picked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up the bill.  There were 14 of us present.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One wonders why Scott, the ultimate businessman, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend money in this way.  Then it occurred to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GIMPS has generated a database of enormous value. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computers dont make mistakes often, but they do make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakes, and the designs have bugs, such as the famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pentium bug.  GIMPS has been quietly collecting data for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several years now on every kind of processor and every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of operating system that is in the world today.  When 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your processor makes a bad checksum, the result is logged. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scott can tell you what processor is best, Intel, AMD or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Motorola.  He can tell you if any particular operating system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlates with more checksum errors.  He can tell you which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combinations of processor and operating system works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best.  
</em><br>
<p>Very cool !
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much do you think this data is worth?  To Intel?  AMD?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Motorola?  How about HP, Dell, Micron and Gateway?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, dunno. But is Scott savvy to the notion of franchising? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ive been meaning to ask Scott if he planned all along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to gather this database, or if it was just a fortunate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accident, an unintended byproduct.  What do you think? 
</em><br>
<p>Sorry that opinion is now commerial in confidence :-)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course, if I win the 100 kiloclams, that would surpass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the book thing as the biggest reward, but still the cite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is way cool.
</em><br>
<p>Well I just *knew* there *had* to be a rational explanation,
<br>
(or several). 
<br>
<p>As Sir Edmund Hillary was wont to say &quot;we choose to go to
<br>
the top of Everest, and, do the other things, not because they
<br>
are easy but because they are hard&quot; or something not at all
<br>
like that. 
<br>

<br>
Go Spike.
