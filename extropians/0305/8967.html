</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average happiness of human beings, i.e. the sum of all happiness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided by the number of people.  The problem is that half the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are of below average happiness, hence they are dragging down the curve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By killing off the less happy half of the human race, we can greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase average happiness, hence this is an acceptable goal for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; averagist.  However it does not stop there, for having done so, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remaining half can once again be divided in to the more and less happy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we can justify killing off the less happy half of the remainder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is repeated until only one person is left, the single happiest

</em><br>
<p>The main reason for being an averagist is that you live in an infinite 
<br>
universe and hence cannot be a totalist.  If so, then observer-instants 
<br>
are not things that either exist or do not exist; the question is where 
<br>
they predominantly exist.  What you want to do is arrange for as many 
<br>
observer-instants as possible to lead to the happiest possible future 
<br>
instants with the strongest possible probabilities.  To have any influence 
<br>
on this, you need to instantiate people.  Killing people just makes death 
<br>
the most likely future of their past observer-instants, which is unhelpful 
<br>
(it makes the universe a sadder place).  You didn't actually make any 
<br>
observer instants stop existing; you just established that a bunch of past 
<br>
observer instants would have subjective conditional probabilities that 
<br>
lead very strongly to death.  10^10^something meters away would be a 
<br>
person just like the one you killed, a very rare survivor, somewhere you 
<br>
couldn't reach.  To help an observer-instant, to thread it into a happy 
<br>
future, you must first instantiate it.  Once a person exists, killing them 
<br>
just gives the observer-instants in their past history a sad future.
<br>
<p>This is different enough from the &quot;averagist&quot; viewpoint that it deserves a 
<br>
different name.  Call it the &quot;threaded&quot; viewpoint.  You want 
<br>
observer-instants to have happy futures.  You can't make a given 
<br>
observer-instant &quot;exist&quot; or &quot;not exist&quot;; *any* observer-instant will exist 
<br>
*somewhere*.  But once a person lives *here*, you can try and keep the 
<br>
thread of their future from falling into a Death instant and terminating; 
<br>
you can try and make as many observer-instants as possible have strong 
<br>
conditional probabilities of leading to happy future observer-instants.
