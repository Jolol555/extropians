</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;inferior animals?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If hunters spend 5% more effort on catching the strongest deer, and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weak deer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mathematically speaking, only if the hunter and deer are not too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unevenly matched.  However, if the hunter has a vastly superior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, vastly superior technology, and vastly superior firepower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no contest between the two.  The hunter's 5% easily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcomes a deer's 30%.
</em><br>
<p>This is a rather inane and meaningless question. First off are these
<br>
rather unsupported assumptions that hunters:
<br>
a) are able to objectively determine which are 'the strongest deer'
<br>
b) are so blessed with deer encounters that they can pick and choose
<br>
which one to shoot
<br>
c) gain some benefit from shooting 'the strongest deer', 
<br>
<p>among others...
<br>
<p>Since it seems I am the only actual deer hunter who is participating in
<br>
this discussion, and likely know far more other deer hunters than all
<br>
others on this list combined, I'll tell you what motivates deer
<br>
hunters:
<br>
<p>a) there is a deer to shoot at. Many hunters go for years without
<br>
spotting even one deer. With 'bucks only' hunting seasons, the odds are
<br>
that most deer a hunter encounters are not legal targets, since they
<br>
tend to breed more does than bucks. While deer populations are
<br>
generally higher due to wildlife management than even during colonial
<br>
times, deer have evolved, due to hunting pressures, to be far smarter
<br>
and more sensitive than their ancestors.
<br>
b) the hunter is able to get a shot at a deer. Deer, being agile,
<br>
camouflaged, and many times more sensitive than humans (they can hear
<br>
you walking through dry leaves from several hundred yards away, can
<br>
spot the blue dyes in most clothing like neon signs, and can smell
<br>
human body and technology odors from dozens of yards or more away), a
<br>
hunter rarely has more than a few seconds to get a shot off.
<br>
<p>As I have said before, few hunters are so skilled and talented that
<br>
they are regularly able to pick and choose their targets. The sort of
<br>
hunts you see on the Outdoors Channel are typically on enclosed game
<br>
preserves and are not typical of hunting in open wilderness, and the
<br>
hunters depicted are typically the most talented around. The odds of
<br>
meeting a hunter like this are approximately that of getting a World
<br>
Cup soccer player at a pickup game at your local park, perhaps even
<br>
worse.
<br>
<p>The only time I know of that regular hunters have the opportunity to be
<br>
choosy is if the area they hunt in has a part of the hunting season
<br>
open to shooting does. In such situations, the hunter would seek to
<br>
shoot the largest doe, a doe which has generally already bred for
<br>
several seasons and has therefore already spread whatever positive
<br>
genetic characteristics she may posess.
<br>
<p>This brings my to my last objection to Mr Jordan's rants. Any deer
<br>
which he might consider to be a 'trophy' animal is a fully mature
<br>
animal, generally about 5 years old. Such an animal has already
<br>
reproduced for several seasons and therefore whatever beneficial
<br>
genetic characteristics it posesses have been spread to the herd
<br>
already. Thus, the claim that hunting trophy animals specifically
<br>
somehow dilutes the genetic properties of the herd is patently absurd.
<br>
<p>The mere act of predation is the primary mechanism by which evolution
<br>
produces more capable, more competetive species. The fossil record
<br>
demonstrates this repeatedly, where scientists have measured brain size
<br>
of animals over time. Every time a smarter predator appeared in a
<br>
habitat and displaced dumber predators, the result for prey species was
<br>
that they evolved to be smarter as well. This has been especially true
<br>
for prey species exposed to human predation.
<br>
<p>Predation is essentially a behavior of opportunity. It is essentially
<br>
different from the herbivore behavior pattern of picking food off a
<br>
tree or bush or from the ground due to bountiful supply. Because it is
<br>
a behavior of opportunity, the predator, even the human predator, does
<br>
not generally get the chance to pick and choose their prey, at least
<br>
when animals are not herded up into groups.
<br>
<p>Because it is so opportunistic, evolution causes the stupid animals to
<br>
be preyed, thus creating selective pressure for greater intelligence.
<br>
<p>Given this, I think that it could realistically be said that our own
<br>
high intelligence is a result of an evolutionary arms race with other
<br>
predatory hominids. Homo Erectus, for example, is known to have preyed
<br>
on early homo sapiens.
