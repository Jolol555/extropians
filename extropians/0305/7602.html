<em>&gt; ### From an economic point of view, hunting is obviously superior to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sterilization - it is cheaper, provides its practitioners with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasant experiences, and tasty meats. 
</em><br>
<p>Its more than that, it is highly profitable. ALL of the wildlife
<br>
habitat preservation spending in the US is paid for by hunting and
<br>
fishing license fees, so much so that during the Clinton
<br>
Administration, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit attempted to hijack the
<br>
federal license revinues for funding anti-gun and animal-rights
<br>
lobbying. Furthermore, the economic synergies created by hunting lies
<br>
in the tens of billions of dollars each year in the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a result of the Supreme Court decision of 1896 (that was the year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think), most wild animals in the US are owned by the state, opening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their management to the political process and ideological warfare, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with deleterious effects for all creatures involved (including 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals, forests, landowners, and car drivers).
</em><br>
<p>The Court ruled that the States can claim the wild herd if they choose
<br>
to. This is not universal. Texas, for example, provides far more
<br>
property rights to land owners with control over wildlife on their
<br>
property.
<br>
<p>Nor are state's claims absolute. Landowners cannot be compelled to buy
<br>
a hunting license to hunt on their own property, and furthermore,
<br>
nuisance wildlife can be legally hunted on the owners land beyond
<br>
seasonal and bag limit regulations. I've shot a number of deer out of
<br>
season on apple orchards for the orchard owners, perfectly legally.
<br>
If you strike an animal with your vehicle, you are generally afforded
<br>
the right to claim the carcass.
<br>
<p>Some law agencies will try to refuse this, claiming that the herd
<br>
belongs to the state. The easiest way to respond to this is to say that
<br>
since the state's animal was negligently on a state road in the middle
<br>
of the foggy night without the DOT and DMV mandated reflectors, lights,
<br>
blinkers, flaggers, hand signals, or signage attached or deployed, and
<br>
was not using a designated crosswalk, the state owes you money for
<br>
repairs or replacement of your damaged or wrecked vehicle.
<br>
<p>I've seen this argument used in court. A freind of mine got a new
<br>
pickup truck from the state of NH specifically because the cops
<br>
wouldn't let him keep the moose he hit and totalled his truck on. It
<br>
was the funniest thing I've ever seen in court... NOTE: A moose can
<br>
have 500-1000 lbs of high quality, lowfat, meat, so this is a
<br>
significant financial issue for your average redneck. Improves his
<br>
standard of living by 10-20% or more for a year or more. Might
<br>
determine whether his kids are malnourished or not.
