<p>
One of the interesting things about this episode is that we are meeting
<br>
some of the non-human personalities of the Matrix beyond just Agent
<br>
Smith. We find out that the Oracle isn't human. Nor is the Architect,
<br>
who claims to have built the Matrix and its predecessors.
<br>
<p>We also meet The Merovingian, a rather egotistical and sado-mercenary
<br>
personality who is heavily franco-philic (oh, the horror) and lives in
<br>
a reconstruction of the castle in southern France (Rennes-les-Chateau)
<br>
once used by the Templars and said to hold the key to the real tomb of
<br>
Jesus Christ and the Holy Grail. He holds an exile program personality
<br>
called the Keymaker, who I have commented on previously, and keeps as
<br>
his girlfriend Persephone (in mythology she's the goddess of the
<br>
underworld). 
<br>
<p>A Greek legend tells of the return of Persephone, daughter of Demeter,
<br>
goddess of the earth, from the underworld to the light of day; her
<br>
return symbolized to the ancient Greeks the resurrection of life in the
<br>
spring after the desolation of winter. Many ancient peoples shared
<br>
similar legends. The Phrygians believed that their omnipotent deity
<br>
went to sleep at the time of the winter solstice, and they performed
<br>
ceremonies with music and dancing at the spring equinox to awaken him.
<br>
<p>I believe that the Oracle is Demeter and Persephone is her daughter.
<br>
The Oracle helped the Architect create the Matrix (the earth) with her
<br>
intuitive logic. The Merovingian occupies a rather lordly position in
<br>
Matrix underworld society, so as his girlfriend, Persephone is the
<br>
goddess of the Matrix underworld. I predict, therefore, that she will
<br>
be of importance in episode III in ending the tyranny of the Matrix and
<br>
achieving the coexistence of man and machine that the Oracle hopes for.
<br>
<p>I think one possibility in this will be the realization by the Zionists
<br>
that Zion itself exists in a virtual world, that they were assimilated
<br>
long ago and their simulated feral existence acts only as a release
<br>
valve for those who refuse to fit within late 20th century simulated
<br>
Matrix society. The illusion of escape to &quot;Zion&quot; provides the sort of
<br>
belief that these rejectionists need to accept, subconciously, living
<br>
as pod people. This is where the Merovingian is going when he says
<br>
&quot;Free will is an illusion created between the powerful and the
<br>
powerless.&quot;
<br>
<p>This will cause a widespread real rejection of both sides of the Matrix
<br>
and a real revolution in a reality where antigravity propulsion is
<br>
physically impossible, where beam weapons are inefficient, and firearms
<br>
run out of ammunition when they are supposed to. I also bet that the
<br>
real world is an uninhabited wilderness, a purified ecology recovered
<br>
from the waste of man.
