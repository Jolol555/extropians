<p>Thanks. But even the stars need their cheerleaders. And I think the
<br>
everyhuman has much to contribute - many of the most useful technologies
<br>
are not truly about technology but social interactions and institutions,
<br>
something everybody can contribute mindpower to. A proposed institution 
<br>
needs to be criticised from a variety of angles. People need to be able 
<br>
to suggest how it can be abused, or what they would rather have instead. 
<br>
Leaving it all to experts is dangerous.
<br>
<p>Then again, I think the goal of everybody who truly belongs here on the 
<br>
list should be to turn oneself into an expert or generalist. Why settle 
<br>
for being normally educated when there is so much more to know? A hour 
<br>
of playful reading and thinking each day will turn anybody into an 
<br>
expert or generalist within a few months to years, and it is less heavy 
<br>
lifting than bodybuilding and far easier than caloric restriction :-)
