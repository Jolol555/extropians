<p>Not that one again.  You are worrying about an obsolete disaster. The
<br>
idea of a &quot;population bomb&quot; was very popular in the middle 20th century,
<br>
based on the observed exponential growth of populations. But that is
<br>
just the first knee of the demographic transition (caused by decreases
<br>
in mortality); as societies get wealthier they slow down reproduction.
<br>
This occured first in the West and is now occuring worldwide. The latest
<br>
UN demographic prognosis suggests a levelling off at 8-10 billion people
<br>
in mid century, and later revisions all seem to lower the numbers. Other
<br>
studies point in the same direction, and we are already seeing serious
<br>
problems with beginning population decrease in affluent parts of the
<br>
world (not to mention the disasters of Africa).
<br>
<p>Today you will not find overpopulation on the agenda in international
<br>
aid but rather poverty. It is the real issue: when people are poor they
<br>
cannot buy food and hence will have to rely on low-tech, inefficient
<br>
food production methods they cannot improve. Similarly for health and
<br>
many other issues. 8-10 billion people is nothing to sneeze at, and will
<br>
cause some tricky problems. But these problems are surmountable since
<br>
people themselves are the ultimate resource (as Julian Simon pointed
<br>
out): they have brainpower, they can work, they are interested in making
<br>
the world better for them and their kin and hence act as a huge
<br>
transforming force.  If we need more resources we can make better use of
<br>
those we have or find new ones. When I was a kid someone told me that
<br>
the Chinese would never be able to build a phone system because of the
<br>
immense amount of copper needed, but by replacing copper telephone lines
<br>
with fiber optics and wireless they are doing fine. But this process
<br>
requires that people have enough economic leeway/freedom to develop new
<br>
technologies, act as entrepreneurs and choose between alternatives.
