<p>You forgot to mention how many humans die in collisions with 
<br>
deer each winter!
<br>
<p>And how many million of dollars in property damage is caused 
<br>
by such collisions!
<br>
<p>I know two people who hit deer just last winter.

<p><em>&gt; please. And since you gave no reason to oppose feeding, I assume there

<p><em>&gt; was no reason...
</em><br>
<p>I didn't feel that one was necessary because it so bloody obvious. Note
<br>
that it wasn't *I* who defined you as an idiot.
<br>
<p>For the thought impaired: feeding wild animals expands their food supply
<br>
beyond what the natural environment provides. This is generally done by
<br>
well meaning fools who have a naive and selfish need to be able to view
<br>
wildlife out their livingroom or kitchen window in order to prove to
<br>
themselves:
<br>
<p>a) they love and care for animals so much
<br>
b) they live in a clean and pure environment
<br>
c) they have acheived their goal of living in harmony with nature, or
<br>
some other such insipid tree-hugger bambi-lover blather.
<br>
<p>Like self-absorbed pet owners who think it is quite alright to send a
<br>
pet to the animal shelter when their own lives get too busy to properly
<br>
care for the pet they thought was so cute and cuddly when it was young,
<br>
the above sort of individuals never consider that:
<br>
<p>a) there is nobody feeding their 'pet' wildlife when they are out of
<br>
town
<br>
b) there will be nobody feeding their 'pet' wildlife when they cash out
<br>
on the appreciated value of their McMansion and move to Palm Springs.
<br>
c) feeding wildlife creates a dependency and causes wildlife to forget
<br>
the ability to forage for natural food sources
<br>
d) an increased artificial food source will cause wildlife populations
<br>
to exceed the local environments natural ability to support.
<br>
e) concentrating wildlife in a settled area makes them a target for dogs
<br>
and cats. When deer, for example, are chased by loose dogs in the dead
<br>
of winter, their energy reserves are quickly exhausted and they die
<br>
nasty deaths.
<br>
f) concentrating wildlife near settled areas makes them more likely to
<br>
be victimized by traffic accidents as they cross roads more often to
<br>
seek out human provided food.
<br>
g) when you get too busy with your life, or you go on vacation, or you
<br>
move away, those animals are going to go without the food you provided
<br>
and suffer accordingly. Being dependent on your munificense, they are no
<br>
longer able to forage for themselves and are far more likely to become
<br>
prey to weather and loose dogs.
<br>
<p>Unlike bambi-lovers, I demonstrate my love of deer by shooting loose
<br>
dogs in the winter time. I don't feed the deer, and I hunt them in areas
<br>
where their numbers are excessive for the environment. 
<br>
<p>Those who claim they love animals but are ignorant of wildlife managment
<br>
principles tend to come into this state from the city, buy up tracts of
<br>
wilderness, then post them as off limits to hunting. This always results
<br>
in large numbers of deer-car traffic accidents on roads bordering these
<br>
properties, as the deer population is unregulated and explodes, forcing
<br>
them to cross the roads to seek out food sources.
<br>
<p>These fools don't realize they cause more suffering than they prevent.
