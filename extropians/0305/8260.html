<em>&gt; Odd, in most circles - Mensa, science fiction fandom,

</em><br>
<p>Well, I like to think that Extropians hold a higher standard than most
<br>
groups.  I also don't think you tend to ramble as much non-stop in person as
<br>
e-mail allows, or bash so many groups simultaneously in a crowd.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Facts are facts, however.  The &quot;hippies&quot; caused their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own wave of resistant bacteria.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt hippies had access to a lot of antibiotics or visited doctors more
<br>
often than non-hippies, or outnumbered non-hippies in the population.  Even
<br>
if they were statistically more likely to breed resistant bacteria, they
<br>
would have been far outnumbered by mainstream America taking their sick
<br>
children to doctors regularly, or by patients in hospitals routinely getting
<br>
antibiotics.  The above statement is toned down, but your earlier statement
<br>
singled out hippies (earlier) and gays (later) as if they were the only
<br>
cause of resistant bacteria.  Doctors caused this by overusing antibiotics.
<br>
It is silly to blame the patients, especially in minority groups that
<br>
wouldn't have had a statistical impact on the total numbers.
<br>
<p>How many people are gay, do you think?  9% or less of the population?  Even
<br>
if gays were ten times as likely to get sick, overuse antibiotics, and breed
<br>
resistant bacteria than straights, their numbers still are less than the
<br>
number of straights who did so.  And remember that AIDS was identified in
<br>
the gay community because it was there first in America.  Resistant bacteria
<br>
has not been identified as being statistically more prevalent in gays.  The
<br>
source of such bacteria seem to be richer hospitals in upscale communities.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The gays who engaged in the then-common promiscuous,
<br>
<em>&gt; multiple partner sex were flying against all medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common sense at the time.
</em><br>
<p>This was before bacteria resistance and AIDS were known to be permanent
<br>
problems.  You seem so down on free love.  Sex doesn't cause disease.  Also
<br>
remember that most disease resistant bacteria are not in the sexually
<br>
transmitted group.  They are in the hospital staff infection group.  You are
<br>
stretching the point to blame sex for these diseases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everything I stated is such common knowledge in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical community, as well as the educated community
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at large, that I can't imagine trying to come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detailed references.
</em><br>
<p>If you can't or won't provide proof, then back off.  This is a common claim
<br>
among such unfounded political rants.  I am somewhat familiar with the
<br>
medical and educated communities.  It is not &quot;common knowledge&quot; that gays
<br>
and hippies are to blame for resistant germs.  Try talking to a real doctors
<br>
and scientists instead of your Mensa, sci-fi and libertarian politicos.  You
<br>
will find some real facts instead of political dogma.  Your combination of
<br>
gay-bashing, hippie-bashing, Hispanic-bashing, poor-bashing and
<br>
liberal-bashing was obviously from a political source and not a scientific
<br>
one.
