There has been discussion recently about Nutritional Scientists' failure in
<br>
developing the Four Food Groups and The Food Pyramid.  I have been too busy
<br>
to dig this up, but here is a summary of a successful lawsuit from last year
<br>
that proved that the meat and dairy industry manipulated these
<br>
recommendations and that they were not scientifically based.
<br>
<p>Dietary Guidelines for Americans
<br>
from &lt;<a href="http://www.apma.net/legal-lawsuits.htm">http://www.apma.net/legal-lawsuits.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>AAHF joined a successful lawsuit by the Physicians Committee for Responsible
<br>
Medicine which was designed to persuade the US Department of Health and
<br>
Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture to revise the Dietary
<br>
Guidelines for Americans. PCRM worked to push these federal departments to
<br>
acknowledge the prevalence of lactase nonpersistence in African Americans,
<br>
Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans and therefore make
<br>
dairy products optional, rather that required, in the Guidelines and in
<br>
federal food programs. The Committee also believed that the Guidelines need
<br>
to recognize the disproportionate toll prostate cancer, diabetes, and
<br>
hypertension exact among people of color and to encourage the healthiest
<br>
possible diets to help reduce this toll. The Committee successfully
<br>
recommended that soy-based beverages with added calcium be included in what
<br>
had been called the &quot;dairy group;&quot; and recommended that the Guidelines be
<br>
revised to include a fully-developed section promoting vegetarian and vegan
<br>
diets. The Committee also asked that meat and dairy products be listed as
<br>
optional food sources, rather than recommended or required. The Dietary
<br>
Guidelines 2000 Committee did declare that plant foods - vegetables, fruits,
<br>
grains and legumes-are the foundation of a healthy diet, but did not make
<br>
particular reference to vegetarian or vegan eating patterns, and failed to
<br>
acknowledge the benefits thereof in preventing chronic diseases. The
<br>
Guideline Committee's report and recommendations can be found at
<br>
www.ars.usda.gov/dgac. Click here to link to the Physicians Committee for
<br>
Responsible Medicine' web site and press release on this subject.

<p>This last link gives some legal information about how the dairy and meat
<br>
industries secretly financed these studies and how the USDA unlawfully hid
<br>
their involvement.

<br>
Court Rules Against USDA's Secrecy and Failure to Disclose Conflict of
<br>
Interest in Setting Nutrition Policies
<br>
<p>Washington, D.C.—The U.S. Department of Agriculture violated federal law by
<br>
keeping secret certain documents used in setting federal nutrition policies
<br>
and by hiding financial conflicts of interest among members of a diet
<br>
advisory committee, U.S. District Judge James Robertson said in a ruling
<br>
made public today.
<br>
<p>The ruling is a major victory for the Physicians Committee for Responsible
<br>
Medicine (PCRM), a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that
<br>
had lodged the lawsuit in Federal District Court for the District of
<br>
Columbia on December 15, 1999.
<br>
<p>PCRM had argued that at least six of the 11 members of the Dietary
<br>
Guidelines Advisory Committee, which formulates the Dietary Guidelines for
<br>
Americans, had financial ties to the meat, dairy, or egg industries that may
<br>
have made it more likely that unhealthy foods would remain in the
<br>
government's diet plan. PCRM's suit also charged that the government had
<br>
undercut the public's ability to participate in and understand the
<br>
Committee's activities. The Dietary Guidelines provide nutrition advice for
<br>
all Americans and form the basis for all federal food programs, including
<br>
the School Lunch Program.
<br>
<p>While USDA had provided information showing financial conflicts of interest
<br>
for six committee members, Judge Robertson faulted the Department for
<br>
refusing to provide details on an additional conflict of interest involving
<br>
a payment of more than $10,000 for one member. This additional conflict has
<br>
not yet been revealed, but PCRM anticipates its disclosure within a matter
<br>
of days.
<br>
<p>&quot;Having advisors tied to the meat or dairy industries is as inappropriate as
<br>
letting tobacco companies decide our standards for air quality,&quot; said PCRM
<br>
president Neal D. Barnard, M.D.
<br>
<p>Mindy Kursban, PCRM's attorney, said, &quot;We hope that this Court's strong
<br>
ruling against the government will make the USDA think twice before
<br>
appointing Committee members with inappropriate industry ties.&quot;
<br>
<p>Prior to initiating the lawsuit, PCRM's efforts to change federal diet
<br>
guidelines had won the support of the NAACP, former Surgeon General Joycelyn
<br>
Elders, Martin Luther King, III, Muhammad Ali, and many others who objected
<br>
to the overpromotion of meat and dairy products given the prevalence of
<br>
lactose intolerance and diet-related diseases, such as heart disease,
<br>
diabetes, and hypertension, among racial minorities.
<br>
<p>The doctors' group scored a partial victory in February, when the advisory
<br>
committee accepted non-dairy foods, such as soymilk, as acceptable
<br>
alternatives to dairy products.
