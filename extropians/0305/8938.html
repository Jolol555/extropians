<p>Research trials looking at how a group of drivers behave when their 
<br>
speeds are controlled will begin in Leeds next week.
<br>
<p>The research, piloted by the University of Leeds and a motor industry 
<br>
research panel have modified 20 cars to examine how driving changes when 
<br>
they use vehicles which detect and adhere to speed limits.
<br>
<p>The trials will consider driver behaviour both with, and without, the 
<br>
speed limiters in vehicles using global positioning technology which 
<br>
tells the car where it is, and what the speed limit is.
<br>
<p>Each time the limit on the road changes, the driver will be altered to 
<br>
that change. The accelerator pedal then vibrates when the limit is 
<br>
reached and the car cannot exceed the limit - unless the driver opts out 
<br>
of the system by braking, stopping or accelerating.
<br>
<p>Driver opt-outs are allowed by using buttons on the steering wheel or 
<br>
using an over-ride kick down on the accelerator pedal.
<br>
<p>Earlier research suggested that vehicles using an &quot;intelligent speed 
<br>
limiter&quot; with a driver-select function could reduce fatal accidents by 
<br>
19% and injury accidents by 10%.
<br>
<p>20 cars have been equipped with the technology, each having a volunteer 
<br>
driver for six months. There will be four sets of trials, involving 80 
<br>
drivers in all.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p>One commentator suggested that drivers might welcome this system if it 
<br>
meant that they never had to pay another speeding fine or get speeding 
<br>
offences on their record.
<br>
<p>Government representatives are assuring everyone that there is no 
<br>
intention to make this technology compulsory. What they might do is make 
<br>
it compulsory for all government vehicles. Then all the government 
<br>
vehicles would get in the way of ordinary vehicles and thus force them 
<br>
to slow down also.
<br>
<p>I found it interesting that the following story appeared on the very 
<br>
same day.

<p>Speeders caught in hundreds
<br>
<p>More than 1,100 drivers have been caught speeding on one of Scotland's 
<br>
most dangerous roads in just five days. Mobile camera patrols caught 
<br>
drivers exceeding the speed limit on the A77 between Glasgow and 
<br>
Ayrshire. Most of those caught now face penalty points and a £60 fine.
<br>
<p>However, Strathclyde Police said that in some cases reports will be 
<br>
submitted to the procurator fiscal.
<br>
<p>The drivers were detected during operations by the Strathclyde Safety 
<br>
Camera Partnership which consists of Strathclyde Police, all 12 councils 
<br>
within the division and the Scottish Executive. It identifies areas with 
<br>
bad accident statistics and installs safety cameras to make the areas safer.
<br>
<p>Chief Inspector David McConnell, of Strathclyde Police, said: &quot;These are 
<br>
very serious statistics indeed from the A77.
<br>
&quot;The message has got to get out to drivers using the A77 that if you 
<br>
speed you will get caught. This recklessness will not be tolerated.
<br>
<p>&quot;The attitude of a significant number of drivers is clearly unacceptable 
<br>
and it is evident that they are willing not only to risk their own 
<br>
safety but the safety of others by what borders on dangerous driving 
<br>
standards.&quot;
