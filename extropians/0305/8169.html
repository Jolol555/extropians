</em><br>
<p>We agree on this. To me, this is one of the most important portions of this
<br>
discussion.
<br>
Subjective experience masquerading as objective &quot;reality.&quot;
<br>
<p>As other threads on this list indicate, information is
<br>
obviously passed through the filters of the network and/or the network
<br>
representative and
<br>
as such take on those entities particular biases
<br>
.
<br>
It seems much more respectful to viewers to have something like E-prime*
<br>
used in
<br>
reporting news- although i think this would be a little too combersome
<br>
especially with the
<br>
attention span that i assume of most network viewers.
<br>
<p>In any case, i think it would behoove our intelligence as a culture if
<br>
reporters and talk show hosts
<br>
would say things like, &quot;in my opinion&quot; etc . . . and consistently remind the
<br>
viewer that this is the
<br>
subjective experience of the reporter (where appropriate) and would cite
<br>
sources when it is
<br>
not their opinion but the &quot;facts&quot; as interpreted or reported by someone
<br>
else.
<br>
<p>I find it unfortunate that relativistic and quantum logic has not reached
<br>
the vernacular yet.
<br>
It seems to me that the endless treatment of &quot;reality&quot; as some block-like,
<br>
objective entity
<br>
as opposed to what seems to me the more accurate description of &quot;reality&quot; as
<br>
a subective
<br>
and verb-like experience causes more stupidity and &quot;bad-thinking&quot; than
<br>
almost any other
<br>
form of brainwashing out there.
<br>
<p>I think that the majority of Americans (people less interested in the rigor
<br>
of intellect and logic
<br>
of a group like this as well as less inclined or able to analyze the details
<br>
and structure of
<br>
arguments being presented to them) are consistently tricked, duped,
<br>
programmed - by a
<br>
language that denies or regretfully forgets the major discoveries made by
<br>
physicists in the 1920's
<br>
and anthropologists ever since.  Namely, that there are multiple
<br>
interpretations of every situation,
<br>
i.e. light seem like a wave if we test it like this and a particle if we do
<br>
it like this.
<br>
i.e. peace loving hippies or dirty, jobless, commies
<br>
i.e. &quot;Jimmy Carter takes a cheap shot at president Bush!&quot; or &quot;Jimmy Carter,
<br>
Tellin' it like it is.&quot;
<br>
etc . . .
<br>
<p>Though i don't expect O'Reilly to discuss the implications of Schroedinger's
<br>
Cat or Godel's Proof
<br>
with his guests, i think a little respect by all of the talk show hosts and
<br>
news reporters for the intelligence
<br>
(latent as it may be in some cases) of the people would do us all a lot of
<br>
good.
<br>
Maybe general semantics and a course of logic should be included in
<br>
journalism schools.
<br>
<p>Seems to me that a little relativity and self-reflexivity could go a long
<br>
way in making people more aware and in
<br>
stopping the stupidity inherent in the presupposition that there is a
<br>
&quot;right&quot; opinion as opposed to a more or less
<br>
accurate or pragmatic opinion.
<br>
