</em><br>
<p>If you say so; here in the Bay Area, it's too hard to tell!  ;-)
<br>
But even so, isn't it still true that there is a strong correlation
<br>
between being conservative and being in favor of drug laws?

<em>&gt; &gt; Yes.  Liberals favor freedom on this one too (in general, liberals

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Except for some twisted but vocal offshoots of feminism.  Or the Soviet Union,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; break things up onto multiple axes (is socialist-left the same as Green-left?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.)
</em><br>
<p>Of course, the very existence of the words themselves (e.g. left vs.
<br>
liberal) has always been a sign.  Guilty of an urge to reify even 
<br>
when I was in junior high school, I supposed that leftists were to
<br>
the left of liberals, and rightists to the right of conservatives.
<br>
I am also pretty certain, however, that there is a huge correlation
<br>
between &quot;socialist-left&quot; and &quot;green-left&quot;, even though (especially
<br>
on a list like this) there are bound to be plenty of exceptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A crude divider might be &quot;liberal is about individual freedom, plus these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days some governmental monetary policy and safety nets, which arguably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase real freedom by increasing stable growth&quot; vs. &quot;left is a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealisms variously about increasing some idea of fairness or justice, usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free of ethnic or traditional bigotry, but often willing to sacrifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual choice and freedom&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds pretty good for me, especially as characterizations---
<br>
and not (heaven forbid) definitions!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd be happy to grant, nay encourage, a distinction between 'conservative' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'right-wing', although I'm not sure what it'd be.  &quot;Conservatism is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small government and individual freedom while right-wing is a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealisms variously about religious rules or ethnic bigotry&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>That's about as good as your previous characterization, IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that certain definitions of 'conservative' and 'liberal'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back into each other is something I've observed for years, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might actually make sense if you think of a tree of politics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverging from Revolutionary times.
</em><br>
<p>Quite interesting; after all, a certain &quot;liberal&quot; direction on
<br>
the political compass certainly became predominate in 1783 in
<br>
the newly formed U.S.  All of &quot;conservative&quot; Europe at the time
<br>
looked quite askance at what was happening here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; go for social freedoms, except for freedom of association, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; freedom to discriminate).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second one is affirmative action and bans on workplace racial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination, is the first anything else?
</em><br>
<p>I had in mind associating with whom you want at your privately
<br>
owned golf club, or renting rooms to those that pleased you
<br>
(and if you didn't like Irish, or gays, then that was just too
<br>
bad for them (and you)).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 7.  Environmental Laws:  new restrictions based on the idea that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment is being changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hmm?  But liberals *like* the laws to prevent environmental change, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; keep the status quo.  Conservatives are much more in favor of economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development (i.e., change).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The root of environmentalism isn't about preventing change, although I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's around too now, but about preventing damage.  Or conserving ecological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital, in economic terms.
</em><br>
<p>I'm either not following you or I disagree.  As for preventing
<br>
change, I've known nature lovers who would hate a desert area
<br>
to become forested &quot;because all the desert life would die&quot;,
<br>
(showing that the increase in total life didn't appeal that
<br>
much to them).  What is &quot;ecological capital&quot;, in economic terms?
<br>
Sure---you can characterize it in terms of &quot;damage&quot; --- but then
<br>
ancient conservatives were all about preventing social &quot;damage&quot;
<br>
by allowing too many people to vote, or express opinions, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; be forced to be civilized  by a petulant and irascible U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Here, it's the conservatives who are all for change!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neo-cons, I think.  US conservatism has tended to isolationism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than anything else.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't think so.  Ever since the 1940's, isolationism has
<br>
been a fringe movement among conservatives.  One could go back
<br>
and read Barry Goldwater's books of the early sixties (&quot;Why not
<br>
Victory?&quot;, and &quot;The Conscience of a Conservative&quot;) to find almost
<br>
the *definition* of late 20th century political conservatism.
