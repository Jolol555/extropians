</em><br>
<p>Well, I'd like to say that.  Back when I was more libertarian I tend to think
<br>
of myself as &quot;classical liberal&quot;, thanks to Friedman and Hayek and to
<br>
'libertarian' being too f-ing long.  And we've got the wave of
<br>
decriminalization going on, yay.  But most elected politicians called
<br>
&quot;liberal&quot; wouldn't say they were for legalization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5.  Pornography:  new modes of sexuality besides the heterosexual missionary

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Liberals favor freedom on this one too (in general, liberals
</em><br>
<p>Except for some twisted but vocal offshoots of feminism.  Or the Soviet Union,
<br>
for that matter, for whatever that might be worth.  I really do think
<br>
'liberal' and 'left' can be usefully disassociated, even before we properly
<br>
break things up onto multiple axes (is socialist-left the same as Green-left?
<br>
No.)  A crude divider might be &quot;liberal is about individual freedom, plus these
<br>
days some governmental monetary policy and safety nets, which arguably
<br>
increase real freedom by increasing stable growth&quot; vs. &quot;left is a bunch of
<br>
idealisms variously about increasing some idea of fairness or justice, usually
<br>
free of ethnic or traditional bigotry, but often willing to sacrifice
<br>
individual choice and freedom&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'd be happy to grant, nay encourage, a distinction between 'conservative' and
<br>
'right-wing', although I'm not sure what it'd be.  &quot;Conservatism is about
<br>
small government and individual freedom while right-wing is a bunch of
<br>
idealisms variously about religious rules or ethinic bigotry&quot;?  The fact that
<br>
certain definitions of 'conservative' and 'liberal' back into each other is
<br>
something I've observed for years, and might actually make sense if you think
<br>
of a tree of politics diverging from Revolutionary times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; go for social freedoms, except for freedom of association, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom to discriminate).
</em><br>
<p>The second one is affirmative action and bans on workplace racial
<br>
discrimination, is the first anything else?
<br>
<p>There's also &quot;gun control&quot;, a limitation on individual choice currently
<br>
considered liberal, although I have a book called _The Liberal Case for
<br>
Handguns_ or (maybe _against Gun Control_) with a bunch of essays by
<br>
self-claimed liberals opposing gun control, some of them claiming to be civil
<br>
rights workers who wouldn't be alive had they lacked guns to scare violent
<br>
Southerners off with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7.  Environmental Laws:  new restrictions based on the idea that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment is being changed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm?  But liberals *like* the laws to prevent environmental change, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep the status quo.  Conservatives are much more in favor of economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development (i.e., change).
</em><br>
<p>The root of environmentalism isn't about preventing change, although I'm sure
<br>
that's around too now, but about preventing damage.  Or conserving ecological
<br>
capital, in economic terms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; be forced to be civilized  by a petulant and irascible U.S.  Here, it's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservatives who are all for change!
</em><br>
<p>Neo-cons, I think.  US conservatism has tended to isolationism more than
<br>
anything else.
