Excellent comments, Lee!  I look forward to hearing more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the whole I agree, except for the last sentence.  There really is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth to most political matters (this perhaps is or is not what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant), e.g., either the CIA and the United Fruit Company overthrew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy in Honduras or they didn't, and the North Vietnamese either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did or did not kill more civilians than did the Americans.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there is a truth to factual questions, I agree.  What I meant or
<br>
questions about goals, motives and &quot;goodness&quot;.  As you pointed out, some
<br>
people would let a thousand criminals go free rather than execute one
<br>
innocent.  Other people rather kill a few innocents to get more criminals.
<br>
These are goal-based decisions.  I am not sure either one can be argued as
<br>
&quot;right&quot; or proven logically.  I think not killing innocents is an obviously
<br>
good goal, but I can envision others arguing a greater utility for allowing
<br>
a few innocents to die.  These are the &quot;truths&quot; that don't exist.  We can
<br>
agree on all the facts, and still disagree on what to do about it.  Whenever
<br>
the question of what &quot;should&quot; happen, we are in subjective land.
<br>
<p>(This reminds me of the copy and kill question.  We can agree on every
<br>
single atom in a thought experiment and still disagree on how to label or
<br>
evaluate what was described.)
