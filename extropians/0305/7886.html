</em><br>
<p>It would be interesting if someone could suggest a reason for
<br>
me to change my reasons (a) - (f), except (a).  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are trying to be rational, it's something of a danger sign if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your opinions are unchanged by facts.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, it can be even more than that; it can be a sign
<br>
of insanity.  Yet it can also be simply the way the human
<br>
mind, thankfully, works.  Suppose that in an argument
<br>
you were having with someone about Newton's gravitation
<br>
formula, your adversary says, &quot;Look, I'll simply demonstrate
<br>
that it's flawed&quot;, and then levitates a few feet.  Would your
<br>
opinion of Newton's law be affected by this fact?
<br>
<p>The reason, of course, is that it takes a lot of energy and
<br>
time to reorganize your entire world view.  So instead of
<br>
cheerfully saying, &quot;Gee, I guess you are right, and that
<br>
Newton was wrong&quot;, you'd probably scowl and say, &quot;There's
<br>
gotta be another explanation!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It could be an indication that your beliefs are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled by an ideology.  In order to protect themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and remain stable, ideologies control your perceptions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it hard to change your mind about things.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  But ideologies aren't all bad.  They can reflect
<br>
an accumulated wisdom over many decades.  So whether it's in
<br>
your eagerness to dismiss flying saucer reports, or reports
<br>
that 5000 Iraqi children were starving to death each month,
<br>
one's ideology can actually be helpful.
<br>
<p>But no one more than I has blasted those who nonetheless
<br>
refuse to admit that they are ideological, and that they
<br>
*can* be blinded by ideology.  It's just part of a wider
<br>
phenomenon; for example, older scientists were blinded
<br>
by their allegiance to the classical world, and simply
<br>
could not &quot;see&quot; the truths of relativity.  IMO, there are
<br>
no general rules to get us out of this basic fact of life.
<br>
You sound as though someone could take Hal Finney's &quot;Ten
<br>
Weeks to Complete Rationality&quot; course and all would be well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given all the surprises and unexpected developments of the circumstances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounding the Iraq war, I think it would be quite unusual for a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person to be able to look back and say, if I knew then what I know now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my degree of support for the war would be unchanged.
</em><br>
<p>To draw the line between those who obviously subscribe to an
<br>
ideology and the class of &quot;rational persons&quot; is a big mistake.
<br>
I have never claimed my own ideological opponents to be
<br>
irrational---and those who go around announcing that a lot
<br>
of other people are &quot;irrational&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, &quot;not thinking
<br>
clearly&quot;, etc., are, IMO, quite incorrect.
<br>
<p>And as for making bad predictions, I cannot prove that I ever
<br>
said the following (as I did prove what my reasons had been
<br>
and are for going to war).  But I thought that the war would
<br>
take less than two months, and admitted to friends that if it
<br>
went longer than that &quot;it would be a long war&quot;.  I did write
<br>
on this list somewhere that fewer than 1000 U.S. casualties
<br>
would be incurred.  But I also predicted that the battle for
<br>
Baghdad would be severe, and that some parts of the city would
<br>
have to be taken street-by-street.  I am only too happy to 
<br>
admit that I was wrong, and would appreciate anyone pointing
<br>
out where else I was wrong.
<br>
<p>A big mystery also remains about the WMD.  Where did they go?
<br>
Or were the reports of their existence as far back as 1996
<br>
completely mistaken?  I freely admitted in my last post as
<br>
to perhaps being wrong about reason (a) of my list (a)-(e).
