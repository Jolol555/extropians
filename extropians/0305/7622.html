Here is evidence that changing to a low-fat diet will tend to have adverse
<br>
effects on mood. 
<br>
<p>This finding is independent of numerous studies which show low serum
<br>
cholesterol is also associated with bad mood, including clinical depression
<br>
and suicide. In this study decreased fat intake adversely affected mood but
<br>
without changing serum cholesterol.
<br>
<p>On a more positive note regarding fats and mood, other studies show that
<br>
increased intake of omega 3 is associated with better mental health. The
<br>
modern diet is very deficient in omega 3 relative to prehistoric levels. In
<br>
fact the link between low serum cholesterol and depression may not be
<br>
causal; at least one study I've seen suggests that low serum cholesterol is
<br>
associated with low omega-3, suggesting that omega 3 is the most important
<br>
causal factor with respect to fats and mental health. -gts

<p><p>ABSTRACT:
<br>
Alterations in mood after changing to a low-fat diet.

<br>
The effects on mood of reducing dietary fat while keeping the energy
<br>
constant were examined in ten male and ten female healthy volunteers aged
<br>
between 20 and 37 years. Each volunteer consumed a diet containing 41%
<br>
energy as fat for 1 month. For the second month half of the subjects changed
<br>
to a low-fat diet (25% energy from fat) and the remainder continued to eat
<br>
the diet containing 41% energy from fat. Changes in mood and blood lipid
<br>
concentrations were assessed before, during and at the end of the study.
<br>
Profile of mood states (POMS) ratings of anger-hostility significantly
<br>
increased in the intervention group after 1 month on the low-fat diet, while
<br>
during the same period there was a slight decline in anger-hostility in the
<br>
control subjects (group F 6.72; df 1.14; P = 0.021). Tension-anxiety ratings
<br>
declined in the control group consuming the higher fat diet but did not
<br>
change in the group consuming the low-fat diet (group F 6.34; df 1.14; P =
<br>
0.025). There was a decline in fasting concentrations of HDL-cholesterol
<br>
after the low-fat diet and a small increase in subjects consuming the
<br>
medium-fat diet (group F 4.96; df 1.12; P = 0.046), but no significant
<br>
changes in concentrations of total serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or
<br>
triacylglycerol were observed. The results suggest that a change in dietary
<br>
fat content from 41 to 25% energy may have adverse effects on mood. The
<br>
alterations in mood appear to be unrelated to changes in fasting plasma
<br>
cholesterol concentrations.
