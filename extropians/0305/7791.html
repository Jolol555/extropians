<em>&gt; 2) vegetable and tofu stir fries (easy to calculate calories by the bowl)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) vegetable fried rice (again with tofu)
</em><br>
<p>Besides tofu, I also use wheat gluten, sometimes called wheat meat or
<br>
seitan.  It has an even higher protein/calorie ratio than tofu.  The brand I
<br>
get has a box of &quot;stir fry strips&quot; yielding 55 grams of protein in only 250
<br>
calories.  This is a whole plate of fake veggie meat.  For a while I was
<br>
eating two of these a day, but decided I didn't need 110 grams of protein,
<br>
even though it was only 500 calories.
<br>
<p>Either way left over a thousand calories for trying to get veggies and
<br>
nutrients in.  Being a high-protein meat-like dish made if filling and
<br>
satisfying.  The only problem is making it taste different every time.  I
<br>
used dozens of various sauces, steak sauce, worcestershire, pepper sauce,
<br>
etc.  I also sauteed onions, garlic, tomatoes, veggies, mushrooms, and other
<br>
combinations of stir fries.  They made great fajitas, but the wrapper had
<br>
more calories than the filling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't get hungry or fatigued on this diet, and can eat a modest amount 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times a day within the 1500kcal limit. It also allows a lot variety within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the form. I would get hungry if I substituted 1 burger into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mix for the equivalent amount of rice, I suspect.
</em><br>
<p>I also never got hungry or fatigued when I was under 1500 calories/day.  I
<br>
have heard of these side-effects, plus mental fuzziness and lack of sex
<br>
drive, but never experienced these unless I went below 1000 calories/day.  I
<br>
don't think I could stick to any diet that had side-effects like that.  I
<br>
also wonder if one is doing damage to one's body if there are major
<br>
side-effects.  It was easy for me to believe I was on a healthy diet while I
<br>
felt good and full of energy.  I can't imagine feeling poorly or losing
<br>
mental and physical abilities, and still claiming that I was getting optimum
<br>
nutrition.
<br>
<p>I personally found it easier to skip breakfast or eat a very small breakfast
<br>
(like 80-calorie diet yogurt), and have two slightly larger meals.  I also
<br>
shaved 100 calories off each day to allow me to eat an extra 700 calories
<br>
when I wanted to splurge.  About once a week I would suddenly get caught in
<br>
a social situation where I needed to eat out, and I would use the extra
<br>
calories to add to my meal at that time.  I also kept meticulous logs of
<br>
everything I ate (protein and calories especially), and kept my average
<br>
where I wanted it.  If I ate extra one day, I would skimp the next day to
<br>
make it come up even.  If I was short protein one day, I made sure to make
<br>
it up the next day.  Conversely, if I had to work through lunch, I would
<br>
allow myself a double-sized meal.
<br>
<p>Lots of water is important.  I made a lot of lemonade (with Splenda) or
<br>
unsweetened herbal teas.  When I felt like soda, I would drink Diet Rite
<br>
(with Splenda, because NutriSweet tastes awful to me).  I also used various
<br>
citrus-flavored Seltzer waters.  All of these drinks had zero calories, but
<br>
could be used to give me some flavor so I wasn't drinking only water all the
<br>
time.
