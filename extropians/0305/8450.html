</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are wrong. Zarella used different TARGETS in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstration, made of different materials, which respond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently to the same ballistic energy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, well, that's basically the same idea as using different ammo -- the
<br>
charge is that CNN did not make a fair comparison of the kinds of damage the
<br>
two classes of guns can do. However I thought they used a bulletproof vest
<br>
in both tests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; THis is the crux of the fraud. There are plenty of rifles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can carry just as much ammo firing the exact same type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ammo which are not on the banned list, and which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semiautomatic just as those on the list.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. However that is not necessarily fraud on CNN's part. It could merely be
<br>
an artifact of poorly written legislation; it looks like the '94 ban did not
<br>
cover all the rifles that the authors would have intended (in fact I'd guess
<br>
the original legislation was diluted by politicians responding to pressure
<br>
from the NRA).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also part of the fraud. Zarella implied that the banned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rifles were automatic, i.e. machine guns. There was not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single machine gun on the list, and in fact, you can still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy machine guns legally in most states in the US.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Implied&quot; is a pretty tough thing to prove in court if it's the basis of a
<br>
fraud allegation. Neither you nor LaPierre actually believe that CNN stated
<br>
that the banned weapons are machine guns, so there isn't much point in
<br>
accusing CNN of saying something it didn't say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Being 'banned' is purely a matter of cosmetics.
</em><br>
<p>Being banned is also a matter of having larger magazines and having
<br>
semi-automatic firing capacity relative to *some* other weapons (though if
<br>
what you're telling me is true, not relative to *all* other weapons). I
<br>
agree that the cosmetics issues are absurd but those are not the only
<br>
issues. If they extend the ban then I would expect them to also increase the
<br>
list of banned semi-automatic weapons to include those other weapons that
<br>
skirted past the '94 ban.
<br>
<p>Note that I am not taking sides here. In fact in general I'm on your side.
<br>
I'm just trying to get the facts straight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think you are backwards here. The ban ends in 04, not 94,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the NRA is not at all upset that the ban is ending
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I wrote that confusing paragraph very late at night and then tried to
<br>
correct it in another post. Obviously the NRA does not want the ban
<br>
extended. The NRA is upset because the GOP might nevertheless extend the ban
<br>
because the White House has stated that Bush is in favor of extending it and
<br>
might cave into pressure to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Machine guns have NOT been banned since 1934. I own one
</em><br>
<p>Somehow it doesn't surprise me to learn that you own a machine gun. :)
<br>
However fully automatic weapons do require a special permit, yes?
