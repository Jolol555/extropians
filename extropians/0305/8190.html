Basically, I feel that it's still true.  But when one comes up against a 
<br>
binary decision that it framed in the traditional forms, some will be 
<br>
coerced into one side, and some to the other.  Once people adopt a 
<br>
position, they tend to feel obligated to defend it, and usually the only 
<br>
way to defend one of these artificial bifurcations is by adopting the 
<br>
mindset that created it in the first place (or at least a close analog).
<br>
<p>An example of this was the recent invasion of Ira?.  (I can never keep 
<br>
those two straight.)  Before the decision was framed as a binary choice 
<br>
there were many views.  After it was framed, the viewpoints tended to 
<br>
reduce, eventually those with viewpoints other than Passifist/Militarist 
<br>
began to be ridiculed.  Naturally those with the militarist view were 
<br>
more agressive in their comments, so they came to dominate the 
<br>
discussion.  (Samantha is noteable for not being stifled despite being a 
<br>
minority voice.)  Many just tuned out of what had become a collection of 
<br>
rantings.  Some started campaigning that all notes on the topic should 
<br>
include a notice in their header, so the threads could easily be 
<br>
filtered out.  Thus those who refused to fit into the 
<br>
passifist/militarist dichotomy left the discussion.  (So did most of the 
<br>
passifists, as being outshouted isn't a pleasant experience...and if you 
<br>
don't really enjoy shouting back, it isn't worth the effort...nobody is 
<br>
listening to what you say anyway.)  And it turned into a bunch of 
<br>
militarists arguing over details of why the whole thing was right and 
<br>
proper.  Nobody had changed their opinion, but the loudest voices had 
<br>
clearly dominated the thread, and that proved that their views were correct.
<br>
<p>This is normal primate politics, and one shouldn't expect anything 
<br>
different.  The improvement is that this discussion didn't physically 
<br>
injure anyone.
<br>
<p>If you really want to get away from this, you need to insist that 
<br>
choices not be phrased in a binary fashion.  There's nothing 
<br>
intrinsically wrong with binary choices, but people seem to have certain 
<br>
mechanisms that get turned on when they appear.  If there aren't at 
<br>
least four major choices (meaning ALL views are in a substantial 
<br>
minority), then you need to expect the &quot;dominant group&quot; mentality to 
<br>
emerge...which tends to put an end to rational argument on any of the 
<br>
features which are dogma to the dominant group.  A nice thing about 
<br>
mailing lists is that one has an easy chance to observe this in a 
<br>
non-costly environment.
