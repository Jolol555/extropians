<p><p>US is seeking new riches with claims to ocean floor
<br>
<p><p><p>By Beth Daley, Globe Staff, 5/11/2003
<br>
<p>he United States is rushing to stake a claim that could be worth billions of 
<br>
dollars in mineral and biological treasures in the last wild place left on 
<br>
earth: the deep seabed. 
<br>
<p>A little-known provision in a decades-old international treaty allows 
<br>
countries to extend their jurisdiction over ocean floor resources beyond the 
<br>
current 200-mile limit if they can prove that the underwater portion of their 
<br>
lands stretches farther out to sea. Many countries' coastlines give way to an 
<br>
underwater plain that slopes down for miles before hitting the true ocean 
<br>
floor.
<br>
<p>With $3.2 million from Congress, a team at the University of New Hampshire is 
<br>
leading a massive mapping effort to pinpoint exactly where these boundaries 
<br>
may be, especially off the coasts of Alaska and the Northeast, two of the 
<br>
most promising regions.
<br>
<p>By one estimation, the United States could reap up to $1.3 trillion in oil, 
<br>
gas, and mineral reserves, and unknown biological resources, such as deep-sea 
<br>
corals that hold hope for pharmaceutical products.
<br>
<p>''We don't really know exactly what is down there,'' says Larry Mayer, 
<br>
director of the University of New Hampshire's Center for Coastal and Ocean 
<br>
Mapping. ''We are confident we can expand the [US jurisdictional] limits.''
<br>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has contracted with two 
<br>
private research vessels equipped with sophisticated sonar devices to give 
<br>
more detail about the shape of the sea floor and where the United States is 
<br>
entitled to stake a claim.
<br>
<p>So far, only Russia has submitted a claim to the United Nations agency for 
<br>
the submerged land rights, but more than a dozen other countries are 
<br>
preparing scientific reports to make their claims before a 2009 deadline. If 
<br>
Russia's submission is any indication, however, the proposed boundaries are 
<br>
likely to translate into nasty international disputes.
<br>
<p>Already, that country's claim to more than 600,000 square miles around the 
<br>
Arctic is being disputed by the United States and four other countries that 
<br>
say Russia's scientific work has ''major flaws.''
<br>
<p>Environmentalists are taking a wait and see attitude on interest in exploring 
<br>
the sea floor. Some hope international oversight could limit the damage from 
<br>
activities such as oil drilling; others fear the treaty encourages greater 
<br>
exploitation.
<br>
<p>''I certainly would be concerned about any proposal or any encouragement 
<br>
about ocean mining until we have a full and clear understanding of the values 
<br>
of the ocean floor,'' said Dave Allison, a campaign director for Oceana, an 
<br>
international oceans advocacy group.
<br>
<p>For years, countries all but ignored this submerged region outside their 
<br>
200-mile jurisdictions, stymied by a lack of technology to drill for oil in 
<br>
thousands of feet of water and a lack of knowledge of exactly what they would 
<br>
find on the seabed. Now, with better maps and drilling tools, Brazil is 
<br>
drilling for oil in 6,000 feet of water -- a depth unheard of 15 years ago. 
<br>
And some believe countries will one day be able to tap into vast amounts of 
<br>
energy reserves of frozen methane in seabed sediment.
<br>
<p>The key legal document in the seabed rush is from a 1982 UN convention that 
<br>
gave more than 150 coastal nations jurisdiction over the resources from the 
<br>
ocean floor to the sea's surface 200 nautical miles from their shore. A 
<br>
provision in this Law of the Sea Treaty also gives these countries 
<br>
jurisdiction over resources on and under the seabed up to 350 miles from 
<br>
shore if they can prove that their continental shelves extend there. The 
<br>
extended area does not include fish or anything else in the water, although 
<br>
it may include some bottom-reliant species such as scallops.
<br>
<p>Existing sonar mapping has given scientists a good general idea of the 
<br>
topography, but the UNH team is relying on a technique called multibeam sonar 
<br>
that can cover the sea floor more completely, giving a better picture of its 
<br>
structure.
<br>
<p>In addition to Alaska and an area beyond Georges Bank off New England, claims 
<br>
might be made near the Blake Plateau off Florida. The UN has a complex 
<br>
formula for staking a claim to the seabed, requiring details such as sediment 
<br>
depths and other indicators of where the continental slope hits into the true 
<br>
sea floor.
<br>
<p>Already, however, existing data the UNH team has painstakingly reviewed are 
<br>
revealing unexpected secrets of the sea floor even off New England, one of 
<br>
the most studied areas on Earth.
<br>
<p>''There are constant surprises,'' says Mayer. ''People always had this idea 
<br>
of the sea floor as flat and boring, but it's not at all. There are all sorts 
<br>
of geological features we're seeing, submarine landslides for instance.''
<br>
<p>Coastal countries have rights over about 20 percent of the world's ocean in 
<br>
their 200-mile zones. According to one analysis, about 54 countries may be 
<br>
able to claim extensions of their continental shelves, accounting for an 
<br>
additional 5 percent of the world's oceans, making the total area claimed 
<br>
equal to more than half of the Earth's land surface.
<br>
<p>Questions still exist, however. It's unclear what legal standing US claims 
<br>
will have because it has not yet ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty, although 
<br>
it abides by its rules.
<br>
<p>According to the treaty, countries have 10 years from the time they ratify to 
<br>
submit their claim. Countries that ratified the treaty more than a decade ago 
<br>
have been given an extension until 2009. Observers say the United States no 
<br>
longer has significant objections to the treaty and could ratify it in the 
<br>
next few years.
<br>
<p>Also certain to be debated is exactly what can be taken from the seabed. 
<br>
While nonliving items such as oil, gas, and minerals are clearly covered, the 
<br>
law states that living ''sedentary'' species can also be taken, although the 
<br>
definition can get fuzzy. For example, Icelandic scallops are considered 
<br>
sedentary by the UN because they can attach themselves to the sea floor, but 
<br>
Atlantic scallops, which can swim, are not, even though they are essentially 
<br>
the same shellfish.
<br>
<p>Once the UN approves countries' claims, it's up to the nations to settle any 
<br>
overlapping border disputes. Once the claims are settled, the areas more than 
<br>
350 miles out to sea may be the next to be debated.
<br>
<p>While scientists are beginning to peer into these abyssal sea regions, some 
<br>
companies are already looking for valuable bacteria and minerals in places 
<br>
such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents that spew hot water from the Earth's 
<br>
crust and undersea mountains. A French cosmetic company is already 
<br>
advertising it is using heat-seeking bacteria from the vents to develop a 
<br>
sunblock lotion that gives more protection, according to news reports.
<br>
<p>''The hope about ocean development is peculiar, subject to myth wedded with 
<br>
greed,'' says Jack Archer, a retired professor of environmental sciences at 
<br>
the University of Massachusetts at Boston and a specialist in ocean policy. 
<br>
''But it's still a great unknown. We don't really know what is out there.''
