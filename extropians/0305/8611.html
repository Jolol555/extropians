&quot;The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race&quot; 
<br>
<a href="http://www.agron.iastate.edu/courses/agron342/diamondmistake.html">http://www.agron.iastate.edu/courses/agron342/diamondmistake.html</a>
<br>
<p>This is an excellent article by Jared Diamond that appeared in Discovery
<br>
Magazine in 5/87. According to Diamond, agriculture is the worst mistake in
<br>
the history of the human race.
<br>
<p>Someone here (Damien S., I think) wrote in a related thread that Diamond
<br>
disagrees with my view that it was for nutritional reasons that agriculture
<br>
led to poor health; that Diamond believes instead that the poor health of
<br>
early farmers was a result of increased infectious disease caused by
<br>
over-crowding and by living with animals. However from this article it would
<br>
appear that such is not Diamond's view. 
<br>
<p>Diamond acknowledges that the pre-agricultural diet was a healthier diet,
<br>
and lists variations on this theme as the first and second of three reasons
<br>
for the poor health of early farmers. The third of his three reasons is
<br>
indeed increased disease from over-crowding, but he adds parenthetically
<br>
that arguments of archeologists who claim this as the only reason are really
<br>
just chicken-and-egg arguments, because &quot;crowding encourages agriculture and
<br>
vice versa.&quot;
<br>
<p>Excerpt from the article:
<br>
&quot;There are at least three sets of reasons to explain the findings that
<br>
agriculture was bad for health. First, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a varied
<br>
diet, while early farmers obtained most of their food from one or a few
<br>
starchy crops. The farmers gained cheap calories at the cost of poor
<br>
nutrition. (today just three high-carbohydrate plants-wheat, rice, and
<br>
corn-provide the bulk of the calories consumed by the human species, yet
<br>
each one is deficient in certain vitamins or amino acids essential to life.)
<br>
Second, because of dependence on a limited number of crops, farmers ran the
<br>
risk of starvation if one crop failed. Finally, the mere fact that
<br>
agriculture encouraged people to clump together in crowded societies, many
<br>
of which then carried on trade with other crowded societies, led to the
<br>
spread of parasites and infectious disease. (Some archaeologists think it
<br>
was the crowding, rather than agriculture, that promoted disease, but this
<br>
is a chicken-and-egg argument, because crowding encourages agriculture and
<br>
vice versa.) Epidemics couldn't take hold when populations were scattered in
<br>
small bands that constantly shifted camp. Tuberculosis and diarrheal disease
<br>
had to await the rise of farming, measles and bubonic plague the appearance
<br>
of large cities.&quot;
