<p>Harvey, there have to be thousands, if not millions of molecules that
<br>
are naturally produced that can go through gloves, masks, skin, etc.

You have to make a stronger case that (a) bionanomaterials will not
<br>
be degradable; and (b) that bionanomaterials are &quot;likely&quot; to be harmful.
<br>
<p>Note, this topic is addressed in great detail in Nanomedicine VIIA
<br>
which is soon to be published -- while there is a lot that that
<br>
is currently unknown -- enough is known that handwaving with respect
<br>
to &quot;extremely dangerous biohazards&quot; seems unjustified.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; RAFI published a report on it, which despite its luddite aims, had

<p>Anders -- for *shame* -- I've finally gotten through reading
<br>
&quot;The Big Down&quot; (<a href="http://www.etcgroup.org/documents/TheBigDown.pdf">http://www.etcgroup.org/documents/TheBigDown.pdf</a>).
<br>
Really really boring.  I have to disagree with Anders with respect
<br>
to &quot;plenty of good information&quot; unless he is talking about some
<br>
other report.  There is little &quot;value added&quot; in The Big Down
<br>
that would not be known by anyone following the ExI/THT or other
<br>
similar lists.  There *are* however various &quot;assertions&quot; of
<br>
positions without any evidence cited to back up those positions.
<br>
[Classic &quot;position claimed without facts in evidence&quot; -- a classic
<br>
luddite ploy.]
<br>
<p>It is worth observing that the ETCGroup may be giving some kind
<br>
of seminar before/with the European Parliament on June 11th.

<br>
<p>I'm giving some strong consideration to attending just so I can stand
<br>
up and disrupt the presentations when they make claims similar
<br>
to those found in &quot;The Big Down&quot;.
