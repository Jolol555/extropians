&lt;&lt;Spudboy,     
<br>
       Yes, that fits what I remember.  I had been in Mechanical Engineering 
<br>
until an elective course in statistics diverted me into Industrial 
<br>
Engineering -- that was like being lost and suddenly turning a corner and 
<br>
recognizing you were home.  I didn't know I had been unhappy until suddenly I 
<br>
<p>found something that was always fun.
<br>
       But the point is I basically quit keeping up with that whole corner of 
<br>
<p>engineering in 1964.  I probably didn't think about it again until the 80s or 
<br>
<p>90s. I couldn't figure out how a 1982 treaty killed an idea that I was 
<br>
reading about back in the 60s -- now all is much more clear.
<br>
Ron h&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, we need not blame the UN (this time) for money chasing lucretive 
<br>
prospects in Silicon Valley, or Malaysia. Rather, the dynamics of a global 
<br>
economy, that was not so dependent on strategic metals as one thought has 
<br>
been the rule. Both Russia and South Africa and Latin America have been 
<br>
replete with abundant resources, for global industry, as well as the US 
<br>
military needs for speciality metals. This doesn't mean that we all should be 
<br>
smug, but that things were never as dire as depicted by news orgs, and that 
<br>
this is predominantly, the case. The development of oil extraction from  the 
<br>
ocean floor, might easily forestall the Hubbert curve for 40 years.
