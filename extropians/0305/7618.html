<p>
Further refining my meta-rule:
<br>
<p>The weights assigned to each of the variables in the numerator could be
<br>
calculated in terms of their relative weights given the RDA's for all
<br>
nutrients. I do not particularly care for the government's calculation of
<br>
vitamin requirements but it does give us a standard from which to work. 
<br>
<p>For example if the Vitamins and Minerals variables are to be single
<br>
variables in the numerator (rather than as in a more precise but more
<br>
complicated formula in which each vitamin and mineral and type of fat and
<br>
amino acid has its own variable) then we could calculate the factors by
<br>
looking at the ratios of the RDA total gram weights of each variable and
<br>
comparing them to the total gram weights of other nutrients in the formula.
<br>
Doing so for all variables would give us relative weightings for all
<br>
variables in the numerator. Where the government has nothing to say (as with
<br>
many phytonutrients thought to be beneficial) we could derive our base from
<br>
recommendations from other sources. 
<br>
<p>Other rules could also be inserted into our computerized diet planner,
<br>
depending on how meticulous want wants to be.
<br>
<p>For example the final rule might look something like this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Optimize the diet such that it contains diverse foods totaling at least x
<br>
in number from the list of all foods above the median on the N/C scale and
<br>
such that the total grams of protein per day equals at least y% but not more
<br>
than z% of [user's] bodyweight and such that the scale of omega 6 to omega 3
<br>
fats is &lt; 3 and such that [etc, etc].&quot;
<br>
<p>The USDA Nutrient Database for many thousands of common foods is
<br>
downloadable in various formats for use in any spreadsheet or database app,
<br>
so serious dieteers can get as creative as they please. Also there are some
<br>
commercial diet planning apps on the market that already do much of the
<br>
above.
<br>
<p>The most important aspect of this proposed extropic diet meta-rule is that
<br>
by limiting foods only to those with high N/C ratios, one will automatically
<br>
avoid most low-quality sources of calories, starting with seemingly innocent
<br>
but low N/C (and non-paleo) foods like bread and cheese and then moving down
<br>
the N/C list to more obvious garbage like ice cream and pizza.
