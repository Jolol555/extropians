</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### This is interesting - what did they propose?
</em><br>
<p>More of the Swedish model, the right wing side was in favor of allowing
<br>
more private treatments, the left was more in favor of doing more
<br>
through tax-funded health insurance. Essentially the &quot;Marxist&quot; and the
<br>
&quot;Liberal&quot; (in the european sense) were social democrats.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It appears to me that the terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; mainly describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor differences in the flavors of statists of all sorts, since as
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Exactly. Non-statists and non-stasists are a relatively small part of
<br>
the political debate in the West. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The insidious questions from the transhumanist posse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bounced away from them - morphological freedom was simply not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinkable issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yes, freedom, and the use of non-violent methods is not a thinkable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue, once you become bound to the left or to the right.
</em><br>
<p>No, the real problem is the assumption that the current system is given. 
<br>
Both of the speakers wanted freedom (but they meant different things),
<br>
none were in favor of violence (both thought rational people would want
<br>
to pay the taxes voluntarily) but they could not imagine a situation
<br>
where the current system is challenged by alternative institutions, new
<br>
lifestyles, new people or running a deliberate political program to
<br>
change the system (and the leftist speaker was supposed to be a
<br>
*leninist*!). So the big issue was the size of the taxes, how much to
<br>
redistribute to which poor and what treatments to subsidize. 
<br>
<p>Transhumanism falls outside the conceivable spectrum because it 
<br>
leads to radical changes of society. Had it only been about increasing 
<br>
lifespan 4 years or producing cheaper goods, then it would have been 
<br>
completely acceptable.
