</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the other hand he says:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;[arrogantly] I believe I was given a special gift from God, and
</em><br>
[humbly]
<br>
<em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't know why&quot; ... and [as Miss America candidates are inclined to say]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to use this gift to help all mankind and bring lasting world
</em><br>
peace.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [my italics]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Being that I am constantly naive on this subject, it is astouding to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people say they were given a special gift from god (female singers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially likely to say this).  But what I don't understand is how a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (as in the boy genius story) that makes mathematical and scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; connections doesn't make the observation that we just crawled out of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ocean not all that long ago ... and that there is no Monkey King.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Is he a believer or just smart at playing monkey games?
</em><br>
<p>All right, we can cut him some slack.  The kid is only 13 and is dependent
<br>
on his grownups (or, sounds like, they may be dependent on him?).
<br>
<p>As to being clever at playing monkey games, it depends what you mean by
<br>
&quot;smart.&quot;  If a nontheist CEO or politician pretends to be a supernaturalist
<br>
(because by admitting his or her nontheism would jeopardize being in or
<br>
rising in one's chosen profession), then being deceitful would be the thing
<br>
to do.  Sadly, years ago gay people had to pretend/lie they were not
<br>
homosexual or else face ostracism - the way nontheists seem to face
<br>
ostracism today, at least in the U.S.A.  But the question remains - is being
<br>
deceitful &quot;smart&quot; in these instances?  (And the other question begs - who's
<br>
keeping score here?)
<br>
<p>Put another way, is being deceitful ever smart?  IMO yes.  If a religious
<br>
nut with a gun to my temple asked me whether I believed in god, I would lie
<br>
and say &quot;yes.&quot;  Question:  Who's keeping score here?  Answer:  The religious
<br>
nut with the gun to my temple (at least, temporarily).  To save my life (and
<br>
this incident could be extrapolated to include saving other people's lives
<br>
if I were ever in a position to do so) I would lie.  And if I survived the
<br>
scoreboard would at least be back in my hands once again.
<br>
<p>As for myself, I think keeping score *yourself* is &quot;smart&quot; in most
<br>
instances, even if that means *not* getting (so-called) ahead in a world
<br>
where you may have to learn to play golf (:&lt;) or be deceitful in various
<br>
other ways for the sake of your &quot;career.&quot;
<br>
<p>To sum up, in my book being &quot;smart&quot; and being &quot;successful&quot; would be:
<br>
keeping score yourself, and (unless your life, which is *not* the same thing
<br>
as your &quot;lifestyle,&quot; is under threat) being neither ethically nor
<br>
intellectually compromising.
