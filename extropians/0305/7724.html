Summary:  It's good to eat a lot of low calorie vegetables and
<br>
a wide variety of low calorie vegetables.  Anyone disagree?
<br>
<p><p>I am continuing my nutritional studies (when not distracted
<br>
by other stuff).  Lots of questions and not so many answers
<br>
so far but I do see two nutritional improvement that it seems
<br>
to me, almost no one disagrees with.
<br>
<p>First is to eat a wide variety of whatever food types are included
<br>
in one's idea of a healthy diet.  Variety will make it more likely that 
<br>
you get some of everything you need.  Variety will make it less likely 
<br>
that you will get a lot of any given toxin.  Variety makes it more
<br>
likely that the nutritional information you have for foods is correct
<br>
because any given data error will have less of an impact and 
<br>
unbiased errors will tend to cancel.
<br>
<p>On the other side I could argue that if there is anything really
<br>
nasty in the food supply you will be more likely to expose yourself
<br>
to it, if you eat a wide variety of foods.  Variety may make your
<br>
system work harder to deal with so many food components
<br>
and toxins.  Variety may add unnesseacry complications to your
<br>
life.  I am bringing up these other ideas but I have not heard
<br>
experts argue against variety.
<br>
<p>The second recommendation is to eat a lot of low calorie 
<br>
vegetables.  Vegetables have lots of vitamins.  Vegetables
<br>
seem to have many protective substances.  Vegetables are
<br>
filling and low calorie so you can eat a lot of them and not
<br>
gain weight.  There are lots of studies correlating vegetable
<br>
consumption to health.
<br>
<p>Can one get to much vegitable fiber?  (I know it's possible
<br>
to not get enough other foods and I'm not suggesting eatting
<br>
only low calorie vegitables but is it likely a normal person
<br>
will ever eat to many vegitables without forceing themselves).
<br>
Are vegetables especially full of natural or added toxins so
<br>
that one ought to moderate vegitable consumption to avoid
<br>
getting to many toxins?  Is it bad for the human digestive
<br>
system to process so much food?  Can one wear out a
<br>
digestive system the way one can wear out knees by running
<br>
to much?  Even if the system is self repairing might so much
<br>
activity speed up aging?
<br>
<p>I would guess lots of low calorie vegetables are good.  I suspect 
<br>
all of the good stuff in vegetables outweighs the toxins.
<br>
I would guess the ease of weight management and positive
<br>
effects on the digestive system would outweigh wear and tear
<br>
problems (assuming a gradual change in diet and a healthy
<br>
system to start with).  I would guess it is possible to overdo
<br>
vegitables but that lots is a good idea.  I imagine that if one
<br>
eats low calorie vegitables when hungry or bored and does
<br>
not force them down that the net effect would be good.
<br>
Certainly better than any other food.  My biggest concern
<br>
would be toxins so I would favor vegetables with lower
<br>
levels of know toxins.
<br>
<p>I am still studying nutrition but I am planning to buy a chest
<br>
freezer so I can keep lots of frozen vegitables on hand and
<br>
add some regular trips to farmers markets for fresh vegitables.
<br>
I'll also keep canned vegetables on hand if they add variety,
<br>
to eat when traveling, and for use in possible disasters.  I 
<br>
already eat about five servings of vegetables a day but
<br>
I think I will start eatting more like a dozen servings daily.
<br>
I don't need to do this to loose weight or avoid hunger.  I
<br>
just think it sounds enjoyable and healthy. 
<br>
<p>My idea would be to choose vegetables at the start of my
<br>
meals as often as I can comfortably do so and eat vegetables
<br>
in preferance to other foods.  I'll of course add anything else
<br>
I think important for a healthy diet.  Basically eat vegetables
<br>
till almost full and add other foods only to meet needs or
<br>
satisfy desires (in moderation).  If I start loosing weight to
<br>
quickly (more than a few pounds a week or some negative
<br>
effect) I will add more higher calorie foods.
<br>
<p>Does anyone think lots of low calorie vegetables or eatting
<br>
a variety of healthy food types is a bad idea?  Any suggestion
<br>
for improvements?
