Tornado Spin
<br>
Global-warming sneaks back into the weather report.
<br>
By Patrick J. Michaels  
<br>
No doubt about it, it's been a good month for tornadoes even by the &quot;spinny&quot; 
<br>
standards of May, when most twisters occur. Even more predictable than the 
<br>
development of severe storms in spring, however, is the phenomenon of people 
<br>
trying to tie such bad weather to global warming. Witness Tom Toles's cartoon 
<br>
in the May 7 Washington Post, which intoned, &quot;These super powerful tornadoes 
<br>
are the kind of storm we're likely to see more of with global climate 
<br>
change.&quot; Who'd he get that from, Al Gore? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
It has become standard operating procedure in climate-change hype to never 
<br>
bother with inconvenient facts. Tons of tornado data are only a few 
<br>
mouse-clicks away. And they show that Toles was dead wrong in his implication 
<br>
that the recent storms show any link to the slight warming of the atmosphere 
<br>
that has occurred in recent decades. In fact, just the opposite may be 
<br>
occurring despite a perception of increased storminess. 
<br>
<p>Two interesting facts: The number or reported tornadoes has increased for 
<br>
decades while the number of deaths has dropped.
<br>
<p>What's going on is called &quot;radar.&quot; Thanks to an awful 1953 tornado in 
<br>
Worcester, Massachusetts (far from the Oklahoma and Texas &quot;tornado alley&quot;), 
<br>
the Weather Bureau (today's National Weather Service) went on a crash program 
<br>
to develop a national network of weather radar. Spearheaded by David Atlas 
<br>
and Ted Fujita (whose &quot;F-scale&quot; rates tornado severity on a 1-5 basis, as is 
<br>
done for hurricanes), meteorologists soon learned that when the radar paints 
<br>
a thunderstorm that looks more like a comma than a blob, there's often a 
<br>
tornado buried in the curliest point.
<br>
<p>...Any reporter (or cartoonist) doing his homework might have asked if indeed 
<br>
the number of big storms (categories 3-5 on the Fujita scale) is increasing. 
<br>
The fact is that the vast majority of tornadoes are in the &quot;weenier&quot; classes. 
<br>
Only about 5 percent reach category 3 or higher. (The severity data is <A HREF="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/">here</A>. 
<br>
Click on, graph it up, and you'll see that the number of severe tornadoes is 
<br>
dropping.)  &gt;&gt;
