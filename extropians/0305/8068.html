<p>
Thanks for the detailed response.  You have convinced me that there was no
<br>
major concerted effort to spread disinformation via embedded reporters.  I
<br>
believe there were a few staged events, a few exaggerations, and a lot of
<br>
over-exuberance in extrapolating local successes to cover whole towns or
<br>
across other areas that had not been controlled yet.  But these are
<br>
reasonable and expected in the &quot;fog of war&quot; as you describe it.
<br>
<p>I retract my claim that embedded reporters were totally controlled by the
<br>
military.
<br>
<p>I believe most of the examples I could find are easily explainable by other
<br>
means.  I also learned a lot more about the disinformation campaign.  It was
<br>
mostly directed inside Iraq  over Iraqi TV and radio.  It appears that the
<br>
military may have deliberately targeted news agencies inside Iraq to keep
<br>
them from broadcasting conflicting stories.  These and other factors have
<br>
convinced me that there was a definite disinformation campaign by the
<br>
military, but that the embedded reporters were not part of this operation.
<br>
<p>I also appreciate your even tone in discussing this with me, even where we
<br>
held radically opposing viewpoints.  This was refreshing compared to some
<br>
other extreme accusations thrown at me recently.
