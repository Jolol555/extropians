<p>I think I'm still agnostically opposed.  I know I argued against it on the
<br>
list, but I've got a contrarian streak where when I'm not sure I'll tend to
<br>
oppose whatever position is being advocated at the moment.  With vehemently
<br>
anti-war friends and family I'd suggest reasons for the war.  
<br>
<p>For me it was &quot;get rid of evil dictator&quot; vs &quot;we're pissing everyone off and
<br>
lying and I don't trust our leaders and what's the long term plan?&quot;  So, we
<br>
got rid of the evil dictator, yay.  Without much loss of life, but that didn't
<br>
surprise -- I figured if you applied Moore's Law to the Gulf War you were
<br>
going to see some improvement.  As you and Keith say, those who thought the US
<br>
was lying about hard evidence of WMDs seem vindicated -- nyah nyah!  Not that
<br>
I'm shocked, since I believed Paul Krugman when he was calling Bush a
<br>
shameless liar before he was even elected.
<br>
<p>There's still concern about what's going to happen next.  A la
<br>
<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0508/p01s02-wosc.html">http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0508/p01s02-wosc.html</a>
<br>
about the Taliban maybe coming back in Afghanistan.  A big concern of anti-war
<br>
people was that we'd kick over the anthill then wander away, and if enough
<br>
chaos got caused we could actually make life worse for the proverbial average
<br>
Iraqi.  Still too early to tell on that front.  There's still gunfire every
<br>
night in Iraq, the WHO doesn't feel secure in helping out to stop cholera
<br>
(disease around wars has usually killed more people than the actual fighting),
<br>
families are afraid to send their kids to school, and this in Baghdad itself.

<p>Plus, it's odd to think of us spreading democracy abroad while civil liberties
<br>
are eroded at home and people want to make the Patriot act permanent early and
<br>
we're criticizing the Canadians for giving people too much protection against
<br>
government snooping.
<br>
<p>So, it's still possible that the net effect of the war could be positive.
<br>
There's still room for a royal fuckup too.  And I'm still voting Democratic in
<br>
2004.
