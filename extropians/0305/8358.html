Yes, now that this story is 24 hours old, denials from (Ret) Major Daniel 
<br>
Hunt, on FoxNews, have disputed the BBC story as being full of holes. One 
<br>
story had US Forces firing blanks, which is untrue. The second claim that the 
<br>
hospital was unguarded is also untrue, since the hospital was guarded by 25 
<br>
armed Fedayeen. 
<br>
<p>The BBC reported the massacre of thousands of Arab civilians, in Jenin, in 
<br>
April 2002 on the West Bank, unverified and given to the BBC by the PA. A 
<br>
later UN examination of Jenin listed 57 verified fatalities, not thousands. 
<br>
Most all of the killed were combatants. BBC misreporting was also apparent in 
<br>
the American attacks against the Chetnik regime in Bosnia, but thats another 
<br>
story, in a long line of stories, not honest reporting, performed by the 
<br>
Leftist BBC. I am convinced that all news orgs lie; but I as a reader, must 
<br>
try to discern, which one is lying the least, so that I can know what is 
<br>
true. I suggest that all list members keep this in mind, and not swallow 
<br>
published statements so whole heartedly.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I didn't comment on the Blanks, whereas I should have. In the live report 
<br>
from the hospital that was broadcast. During the interviews with 
<br>
Doctors/Patients, they showed numerous bullet holes in the walls of the 
<br>
hospital ward where Jessica was kept. Allegedly fired by the Special Op's 
<br>
during the rescue.  They also showed what was described as 'grenades' that 
<br>
were used in the raid. These appeared to be standard flashbangs or smokes.
<br>
As I remember, there was no mention of the armed Fedayeen.
<br>
<p><p>I missed the reports of the Jenin Massacre, So I can't comment. The over 
<br>
exaggeration doesn't surprise me at all. Although in general the News from 
<br>
the BBC is usually very factual, it sometime omits information and portrays 
<br>
things with a leftist slant. This is much more pronounced with any news 
<br>
regarding a National interest story, for obvious reasons and particularly 
<br>
with wars. 
<br>
In time of crisis, such as the gulf wars, 911etc I tend to wear my thumb out, 
<br>
channel hopping. It seems to be the only way to get a good idea of what is 
<br>
happening. It was interesting to see that Al Jazira, which was a free 
<br>
satellite channel. Is now a subscription channel. im not sure when that 
<br>
happened, but I can think of a few good reasons why it happened.
