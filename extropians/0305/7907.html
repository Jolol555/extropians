<p>
Before your diet
<br>
<p>I have a suggestion for those embarking on diets. You might want to
<br>
condition your mind and household at the same time as conditioning
<br>
your body with a body fruit-and-vegetable throughput for one week.
<br>
<p>During the seven days you give your body a break from refined flour,
<br>
sugar and caffeine, and you drink an unlimited amount of herbal
<br>
teas, juices, and you eat an unlimited amount of fruits and
<br>
vegetables. Variations of this detox diet allow some whole grains
<br>
such as amaranth, buckwheat, brown rice, millet and quinoa and at
<br>
the same time avoid barley, corn, oats, rye and wheat (the reason
<br>
given is that many people experience congestion or poor digestion
<br>
when they eat these latter grains.) You can season your vegetables
<br>
with a small amount of oil (olive oil or flaxseed oil), which aids
<br>
digestion, as well as other seasonings (raw garlic, fresh herbs) so
<br>
you won't miss your favorite strong flavors.
<br>
<p>In addition to the food, you might consider exercising at least an
<br>
hour per day (moderate exercise: walking, cycling, yoga...) to boost
<br>
your circulation and sweat out waste, and it is important to keep
<br>
hydrated- so then drink at least six glasses of water per day.
<br>
<p>During this week you are purging your body of items not necessarily
<br>
good for you, at the same time you will lose water bloat and will
<br>
see your weight drop 3 or more pounds, which will give you a
<br>
psychological boost. Some authors suggest embarking on this kind of
<br>
purging a few times a year to improve your digestion and help you
<br>
keep off bloat.
<br>
<p>After the seven days are finished, don't go back to your typical
<br>
eating habits because you will likely just gain the weight back.
<br>
Each day afterwards, introduce a new food, and pay attention to how
<br>
your body feels. By purging your body of toxins this way with fruits
<br>
and vegetables, it will be easier to spot foods that are bad for
<br>
you, such as those will give you symptoms like bloating, congestion,
<br>
or fuzzy thinking.
<br>
<p>The goal of such a 'preconditioning' (as I call it) is to break your
<br>
usual routine in order to try healthier habits, to tighten the links
<br>
between mind and body, and to enhance your body's ability to shed
<br>
waste. You become accustomed with seeing your refrigerator full of
<br>
fruits and vegetables, so then after the seven days, you can strive
<br>
to keep your refrigerator stocked with such items. Probably you
<br>
exercised more during this week, so then you can strive to keep it
<br>
up, thinking of new ways to include it during your day.  You will
<br>
likely find yourself more mentally alert and will probably sleep
<br>
better during the nights, too.
<br>
<p>Authors usually give detailed 'plan' of what vitamin/mineral
<br>
supplements, oil, etc to include, but I've never been fond of that
<br>
kind of rigor when I am dieting (an activity which I usually
<br>
hate anyway; I prefer, rather to increase exercise if I want to lose
<br>
weight). However, if you are fond of that kind of rigor, you can
<br>
read a description in the April issue of Natural Health magazine
<br>
in an article titled: &quot;Detox in 7 Days&quot;. That article, in turn,
<br>
offers more information on 'detoxing' from a book by Dr. Elson
<br>
Haas called _the Detox Diet_ and from his web site: www.elsonhaas.com
