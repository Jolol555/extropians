</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to pay extra to be able to hunt.  
</em><br>

<p>What other costs are there?

<em>&gt; we'd have mass acres of coca fields. I have a suspicion you'd think

</em><br>
<p>They would only go for coca production so long as cocaine were illegal.
<br>
Legalized cocaine would be dirt cheap.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; same is true of you.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, that is the attitude of a free citizen, now, isn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, whereas natural predators (not being heavily armed) pick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; off the weak and inferior, trophy-hunting hunters pick off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; largest and healthiest specimens, a reverse culling that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously detrimental to the herds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### What kind of evidence would you like to offer in support of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What evidence would you expect? I have a cousin who is a hunter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never heard him exclaim, &quot;Wow, I caught a really scrawny, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young, lame one today! Me big hunter!&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>By the time a deer is big enough to be trophy material, he has mated
<br>
quite a number of times, so there is no chance of size being culled
<br>
from the genome.
<br>
<p>Instead what does, in fact, occur, is that the dumbest deer get shot
<br>
and the smartest get away, which has led to a forced evolution of
<br>
rather cagey, intelligent deer which are far smarter than their
<br>
ancestors. Tracking a mature buck today pits you against an animal
<br>
smart enough to sense you on his tail from several hundred yards away,
<br>
and brave enough to circle around behind you (where you are not
<br>
looking), to get a peek at the opposition.
<br>
<p>Getting &quot;a big one&quot; as your cousin enthuses, indicates a person who has
<br>
either outsmarted a rather smart mature animal, or perhaps shot one
<br>
whose mental faculties are damaged by brain worms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Tell me more. How low cost is it? Is it cheaper than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative price of hunting? Will its proponents be willing to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outbid (with their own money) the hunters? Are you talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hormonal methods? What is their impact on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the psychology of the deer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a veterinarian volunteers everything, it's free. I'm sure a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunter's lobby could outbid them, which obviously makes the hunters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  right. *rolls eyes*
</em><br>
<p>You obviously have absolutely no idea of what you are talking about.
<br>
<p>A program to sterilize the wild deer population will require a program
<br>
much like that used to vaccinate deer that is performed currently and
<br>
is entirely financed by hunter license fees. This program requires the
<br>
use of aircraft to overfly wilderness in grid patterns, much like a
<br>
search grid looking for lost hikers or downed aircraft. From the
<br>
aircraft, food chips dosed with sterilization medication are dispersed.
<br>
<p>Of course, if there is no hunting, then there are no license fees to
<br>
finance such a program and you the taxpayer must pay for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Also, death of a sterilized animal of old age, disease, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; predation, is still more shocking than having its brains shot out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even if starvation were not a problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything dies sometime (for now). You're making a case for shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every animal (and human) in the head right now. 
</em><br>
<p>Only if I and Rafal stupidly equate animal suffering with human
<br>
suffering. Humans in suffering go to hospitals. Wild animals do not.
<br>
Humans get treatment for their suffering, and in most cases die rather
<br>
painlessly. Until other animal species invent their own health care
<br>
technologies, they will continue to suffer because that is their
<br>
nature. We don't have to make it any worse than it is, and what you
<br>
propose DOES make it worse, no matter how noble your intentions are,
<br>
specifically because, as I've demonstrated, you have no idea what you
<br>
are talking about. Good intentions based on ignorance and stupidity
<br>
cause most human suffering in the world, and you want to perpetrate
<br>
more of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; any more than I would feel the need to remunerate child 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; molestors for depriving them of the ability to molest children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Ah, here is the true belief at last. Hunting is evil. Hunters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are evil. They are scum, to be wiped off the earth if possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm. You've moved from my statement on nonremuneration to putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words in my mouth like evil, scum, and wiping off the earth. 
</em><br>
<p>He put no words in your mouth. You specifically equated hunters with
<br>
child molesters. As I recall, there was a certain genocidal dictator of
<br>
the last century who was a vegetarian... should I then conclude that
<br>
all vegetarians are evil?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You see, the form of ethical reasoning that you are using, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethics of repugnance (&quot;makes my stomach turn&quot;), the type of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking exhibited by Leon Kass, and by Jeremy Rifkin, is a way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of answering questions which has no place in the civilized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society. If unopposed, it promises bad outcomes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all those against whom it is directed, even you, once you find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yourself in the &quot;repugners&quot; crosshairs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My ethics involves a lot more than stomach-level &quot;repugnance&quot; :) But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my reaction was to your imagination that hunting is pleasant, a gut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction itself, so to speak. It would take a long time to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my ethics, more than emails could sustain.
</em><br>
<p>I've heard it all before, and found that the 'ethics' of vegetarians
<br>
breaks down to a type of transference psychology, where the vegetarian,
<br>
becoming a herbivore, starts to identify with other herbivorous
<br>
species, which tend also to be prey species to predatory species. In
<br>
identifying with prey species, they wish to eliminate what they
<br>
perceive as predators: hunters, for example. Some shrinks have
<br>
theorized that this was the core of Hitler's genocidal ambitions, as he
<br>
saw the jews as predators on the productively bovine Germanic people.
<br>
It is not an accident that vegetarians are predominantly anti-gun,
<br>
anti-military, anti-capital, and generally collectivist in attitude.
<br>
These are all rational conclusions from a prey species point of view...
