<em>&gt; I have a huge supply of 800 mg tabs. I've forgotten where I obtained it. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not however obtain it through health insurance (I probably couldn't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so even I tried as I am not diabetic). Metformin is however very cheap, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medicines go. I split the tabs in half and take 1 or 2 half-tabs daily with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meals, depending on how glycemic my meals happen to be. I've tried taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metformin in the absence of meals but in my case doing so tends to send my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blood sugar too low. Claims to the contrary (that metformin cannot cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypoglycemia) should be considered suspect, imo.
</em><br>
<p>So do you regularly check A1C and other things in your blood? Any 
<br>
positive effects? What about keeping an eye on liver function? Necessary 
<br>
for healthy individuals?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;To be clear, the news re: Metformin is that it is a very good CR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mimic... not an AGE blocker. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay thanks. I have tried to find research to support this claim but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't. Have you seen any? A couple of weeks ago I looked at the site of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the organization funded by LEF that makes the claim, but couldn't find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything to substantiate it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think they may have released some results last year at a conference, 
<br>
but generally no, they haven't yet released the complete data yet. There 
<br>
is a chart in the latest LEF mag that shows Metformin as producing an 
<br>
almost 100% match in gene response as compared to CR when studied using 
<br>
gene chips. Plus of course the mice studies conducted by others that 
<br>
showed 20%+ life extension.
