Anders Sandberg makes a handy chart:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tech Social Economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -   -   -  Anti tech authoritarians (reactionaries)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -   -   +  Anti tech conservatives (Kass, Fukyama)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -   +   -  Anti tech liberals (Rifkin)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  -   +   +  Anti tech libertarians (small is good?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  +   -   -  Pro tech authoritarians (high tech fascism,prometheans)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  +   -   +  Pro tech conservatives (good for business)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  +   +   -  Pro tech liberals (left transhumanism?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  +   +   +  Pro tech libertarian (&quot;classical&quot; extropianism)
</em><br>
<p>Which is very good, but imho fails to consider the result of tech on the 
<br>
social and economic scales, from a Lessigian (?) 'Code is Law' 
<br>
perspective. The problem being that all this tech is patented or 
<br>
copyrighted, and that the tech can use the tech to enforce such at the 
<br>
level of the tech.
<br>
<p>Anders chart considers these three as being of equal value, yet it seems 
<br>
to me that a + on the tech side is currently promoting fascism, in the 
<br>
Code is Law sense. That is, we have the political issues to resolve 
<br>
before the tech side can be value-neutral. One might argue we need at 
<br>
least a few decades of -/+/+ before we can hope to reach +/+/+
<br>
<p>Again I reference my years-old SimEarth simulation, now seen thru this 
<br>
chart: +/-/- (Pro tech authoritarians) led to a singularity in ~100 
<br>
years, which was an escape from the hellish environmental conditions on 
<br>
earth (80 hour workweeks, oceans boiling away, massive dieoffs, endless 
<br>
wars). The -/+/+ (small is good) led to a singularity in ~1000 years, 
<br>
but earth remained pleasant (few if any wars, no mass dieoffs, 20 hour 
<br>
workweeks). My personal natural point seems to be close to the 20 hour 
<br>
workweek, while another 20 hours of my leisure time is spent on 
<br>
research. Which would you prefer?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
