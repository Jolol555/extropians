<em>&gt; Thanks for posting this resource, Harvey.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This raises the question: how does one get started in network/computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security work? I consider it a short hop from some of the kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of testing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've done, which includes lookung for buffer vulnerabilities, etc. But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably could use some mentoring, and who would be willing to do that?
</em><br>
<p>I got my start in software development and network development, and moved
<br>
from there to quality control and beta-testing like it sounds you do.
<br>
Quality, debugging, testing, and evaluation are all parts of the big
<br>
security picture.  It sounds like you are already on your way to becoming a
<br>
security person.  The whole point of security is making technology do what
<br>
it is supposed to (and not what it isn't).
<br>
<p>As for who would mentor you, there are a number of professional training
<br>
courses that lead to security certifications.  SANS would be a good start
<br>
for beginners.  CISSP for professionals.  CISA for security auditing.  CISM
<br>
for management.  The NSA's Infosec Assessment Methodology for government
<br>
contractors doing security.
<br>
<p>Working in the telecomm industry or network industry is a good place to
<br>
evolve into network security.  Being a software developer, especially with
<br>
databases and corporate applications, is a good place to evolve into
<br>
application security.  Any military or aerospace subcontractor work also
<br>
runs into a lot of security requirements, and can evolve into security.  A
<br>
subspecialty in encryption would involve higher mathematical skills evolving
<br>
into encryption algorithms.
<br>
<p>For someone wanting to move into the security field, I would say software
<br>
plus networks, and then learn security.  Security certifications are good,
<br>
since the lay out and then test a specific set of security skills.
<br>
Consulting work or project management work is also very useful.  Half of
<br>
security is evaluating requirements and making sure they are really met, or
<br>
looking at a design or plan and envisioning how it can go wrong and what can
<br>
be done to prevent problems.  Many implementers simply apply straight
<br>
forward logic to doing something that they expect to work, and are totally
<br>
surprised when it goes haywire.  If someone is good at debugging, testing,
<br>
or foreseeing consequences that others don't, they would be an excellent
<br>
candidate for security work.
<br>
<p>These are the &quot;regular&quot; paths toward security.  &quot;Irregular&quot; paths might
<br>
include a semi-criminal background in hacking or snooping.  Gaining
<br>
expertise with underground tools.  Learning tricks of the trade from other
<br>
hackers.  Figuring out the ways things really work under the covers, and
<br>
figuring out ways around expected behaviors, all provide a lot of
<br>
experience.  This is a dangerous method to enter the field, however.  It
<br>
might be useful if someone had such a colorful background already, since
<br>
they could draw on those years of experience.  But if someone did not have
<br>
that background, it is probably not a good path toward career development.
<br>
There is too much hype, and bogus wanna-be's on the Internet, that I doubt a
<br>
newcomer to the underground could figure out what was real and what wasn't.
