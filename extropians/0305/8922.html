<p>Re:
<br>
<em>&gt; I guess I'm not making myself clear.  I am not talking about promoting these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies, lobbying for these technologies, or educating the public about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these technologies.
</em><br>
<p>But Harvey, some of these things may be quite significant.
<br>
I believe Brett has significantly influenced Stem Cell
<br>
legislation down under -- that in turn influences research
<br>
funding down under.  These things are connected(!).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I want to know is how many of us are actually working on these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies or developing these technologies.  We seem to have too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in &quot;sales&quot; and too few in &quot;production&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I've spent most of the last 3 years trying to get concepts for
<br>
whole genome engineering into serious development -- I haven't
<br>
been very successful due to the current funding climate but am
<br>
aware of 2 other companies that are making some slow progress.
<br>
So there *is* progress being made on the enabling technologies.
<br>
<p>And though Zyvex is having some development speed bumps
<br>
(private info) they actually do have a product out now --
<br>
the S100 Nanomanipulator (though I would probably call it
<br>
a micromanipulator) [but it does probably scale down
<br>
fairly easily].
<br>
<p>I had a recent private communication from Ken Clements
<br>
that he has been granted a patent on &quot;microactuators&quot;.
<br>
<p>So slowly, step by step there is progress.  I think you may see
<br>
a lot start to happen due to the last 5-8 years of genome and
<br>
protein structure decoding over the next 3-5 years [i.e. 2003-2008].
<br>
<p>There are people in the trenches its just not always obvious.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Robert
