<p>According to the transcript, which follows, they tested a banned Chinese

non-banned AK-47 against both the bulletproof vest and the cinderblock but
<br>
clearly they tested it against at least one of those targets and found that

it did less damage than the banned version. What is the best explanation? 
<br>
<p>In the transcript below the Sheriff seems to explain the differences in

damage by pointing to the differences in the size of the magazines: 10
<br>
rounds for the legal weapon vs. 30 rounds for the banned weapon. 
<br>
<p>TRANSCRIPT:
<br>
<p>JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm John Zarrella. Coming up, the ban on
<br>
assault weapons heats up. We'll take you live to the firing range. 
<br>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: Mixed signals on Capitol Hill on the assault weapons ban that
<br>
expires next year and House GOP leader Tom DeLay has indicated he won't
<br>
bring it up for renewal. House Speaker Dennis Hastert says no decision has
<br>
been on that vote and that DeLay was caught off guard when he made his
<br>
comments. 
<br>
<p>The 1994 law banned 19 types of semi-automatic guns.
<br>
<p>CNN Miami bureau chief, John Zarrella, looks at what the controversy is over
<br>
these weapons -- John.
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: Kyra, we're out at -- in western Broward County at Marcam Park at
<br>
the Broward sheriff's office firearms training range and Sheriff Ken Jenne
<br>
has been gracious to join us out here today and to demonstrate for our
<br>
viewers exactly what the issue is with assault weapons. 
<br>
<p>I guess the first question, sheriff, that I would ask you is -- I know you'd
<br>
like to see this ban remain in place. Why? SHERIFF KEN JENNE, BROWARD
<br>
COUNTY, FLORIDA: Because I think guns are the tools of hunters, but these
<br>
weapons are really the tools to kill people and there's a major, major
<br>
difference. 
<br>
<p>You're going to see a magazine with 30 rounds in it compared to a magazine
<br>
with 10. There's a major difference in how these weapons will operate, how
<br>
it will be affected and frankly, my deputies volunteer every day to be on
<br>
those streets -- lives for greater danger. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: Let's get to the demonstration with your detective, Chris Worth
<br>
(ph). And first, what is he going to demonstrate for us, first? 
<br>
<p>JENNE: First, the deputy is going to demonstrate a AK-47, the Chinese
<br>
version, which is the pre-banned version. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: It's currently banned, then?
<br>
<p>JENNE: It's currently banned. 
<br>
<p>(CROSSTALK)
<br>
<p>JENNE: Absolutely. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: OK. OK, we'll, let the detective show us. 
<br>
<p>(GUN SHOTS)
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: That's into a cinderblock. 
<br>
<p>JENNE: That's into a cinderblock. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: And now into a bulletproof vest. 
<br>
<p>JENNE: And this is a vest similar to the ones that our deputies have worn.
<br>
It's a used one, but one that's similar. 
<br>
<p>(GUN SHOTS)
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: Now that bullet's clearly fired right through that. 
<br>
<p>JENNE: Right through and there's paneling on the front end and the back. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: Now he's going to change to another weapon and while he changes,
<br>
let me ask you then -- you know, a lot of the critics are saying, there's no
<br>
evidence that the ban has really reduced crime. What do you think? 
<br>
<p>JENNE: Well, this is what I can tell you. I've got a heck of a lot of people
<br>
in my jails that would like to get their hands on weapons like this. So that
<br>
tells me it's doing something good. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: Now this weapon now is legal under the current laws. 
<br>
<p>JENNE: Absolutely. This is an AK-47 also, but a civilian model. It has some
<br>
differences and right now this only has a clip of 10 in the magazine -- or
<br>
10 rounds in the magazine. So this is a big difference than the 30 rounds in
<br>
the previous magazine. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: OK. 
<br>
<p>(GUN SHOTS)
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: So what makes the big difference here is the amount of firepower,
<br>
then. 
<br>
<p>JENNE: Absolutely. When deputies and people are on the street, or people
<br>
that are subjected to drive-by shootings, these weapons are not that
<br>
particularly accurate to begin with. When the more rounds you have, the more
<br>
firepower you have, the more danger it is to law enforcement as well as the
<br>
general public. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: Sheriff, as we wrap up real quickly, do you believe, then, the ban
<br>
should be extended and do you believe that most sheriffs and police officers
<br>
are -- and deputies are in agreement? What do you think?
<br>
<p>JENNE: I would hope that most law enforcement officers across this country
<br>
would be in agreement with it. I'd like to see it extended. 
<br>
<p>You know, frankly, no one is suggesting long guns. No one is suggesting
<br>
handguns should be banned. They -- a matter of fact, a lot of us go hunting
<br>
on a regular basis in Florida. 
<br>
<p>ZARRELLA: Sheriff, thank you so very much for joining us. 
<br>
<p>Kyra, a pretty powerful demonstration of the firepower of these weapons that
<br>
police, at least Sheriff Ken Jenne and the Broward sheriff's office, want to
<br>
see kept off the streets -- Kyra. 
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: No doubt. It puts in perspective. Our John Zarrella, great report.
<br>
Thanks, John. 
<br>
<p>Well, you probably remember this scene: the 1997 shootout between two men
<br>
armed with a cache of assault weapons and Los Angeles police. It followed a
<br>
botched bank robbery and amazingly ended with only the two suspects killed. 
<br>
<p>Bernard Parks became chief of the LAPD shortly afterward. He is now a Los
<br>
Angeles city councilman. He joins us live to talk about the ban. 
<br>
<p>Councilmember Parks, we both remember that well. You were on the force. I
<br>
was a reporter at that time. That really changed the face of how everyone
<br>
looked at those weapons, didn't it?
<br>
<p>BERNARD PARKS, LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL: I think it was the most graphic
<br>
illustration of why assault weapons have no place in domestic society.
<br>
PHILLIPS: So what would letting the assault weapons ban expire do? 
<br>
<p>PARKS: I think it gives really a license and an indication to the criminal
<br>
element that we can go back to the days of prior to '94, that everything
<br>
goes and that the communities are going to be victimized by these
<br>
high-powered weapons and a criminal community that will be in charge of our
<br>
cities. 
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: Now councilmember, some gun control groups say police are more
<br>
likely to be killed by an assault weapon than the average citizen. Are we
<br>
putting police at risk? 
<br>
<p>PARKS: I think we're putting police, but the overall community. We lose
<br>
several thousand people in the United States each year and about 80 plus
<br>
percent is by gun violence and the I think the issue of talking about gun
<br>
control really doesn't capture the issue. It's the gun violence that really
<br>
hits at the heart of every community in our country. 
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: Well, you were a police officer for 38 years. How difficult is it
<br>
to defend against an assault weapon? 
<br>
<p>PARKS: It is very difficult because generally the first responding officer
<br>
is totally unaware of the circumstances and the firepower. You may later be
<br>
able to bring a SWAT unit or someone that can match that firepower, but
<br>
there's nothing that an officer or first responder carries with them that
<br>
can compete with that. And there's certainly nothing in the community that a
<br>
citizen or community member can compete with. So you are at a total
<br>
disadvantage when confronted with something of this high power. 
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: So can you think of any reason to have an assault weapon. 
<br>
<p>PARKS: There's no reason. As the sheriff said earlier in your report
<br>
there's. Only one reason for it. You cannot hunt with it. It's only one
<br>
reason and that is that it kills people. It's a military weapon. It should
<br>
be kept in a military arsenal and out of the domestic society. 
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: Well, sir, as police chief I know the homicide rates fell, the
<br>
robbery rate, the rape rate, you really did know how to handle crime. I have
<br>
to ask you about a new project you're working on as council member there in
<br>
Los Angeles. 
<br>
<p>PARKS: We are working on bringing football back to the city of Los Angeles
<br>
although Atlanta has the Atlanta Falcon, we have been without football since
<br>
'94, the same year that the assault ban went in place. But we want to bring
<br>
football back to the Colosseum, the historical site, the community and the
<br>
economic benefits would be tremendous for a city that's the second largest
<br>
media market in the country. 
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: From police chief to council member, still making inroads in all
<br>
types of ways. Bernard Parks thank you. PARKS: Thank you Kyra, nice seeing
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>PHILLIPS: Great seeing you too.
