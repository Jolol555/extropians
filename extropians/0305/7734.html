<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Harvey, which study are you referring to?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was referring to the original URL being discussed:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-05-02-2">http://www.betterhumans.com/News/news.aspx?articleID=2003-05-02-2</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was not referring to the URL you posted in response to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous URL:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm">http://www.ism.uit.no/kk/e/key_findings.htm</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are applying my response to the wrong posting!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The original URL was not a &quot;study&quot;. It was a piece of reporting. It had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quotes from scientists who as far as I can tell did not even work on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two studies. At any rate, my comments were not about the reporting, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather the underlying studies, most specifically the second one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentioned. So again I ask, which study were you referring to with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I must not have been clear enough.  The URL I was referencing was a
<br>
piece of reporting about &quot;Two Large Studies.&quot;  The specific one I was
<br>
referencing was the first one, the US study.  You apparently were
<br>
referencing the second one, the European study.  My comments on the first
<br>
study did not apparently apply to your understanding of the second study.
<br>
You therefore jumped all over me saying that I must have misread &quot;the&quot;
<br>
study.  I followed back through the threads and figured out where I was
<br>
referring to one URL and one study, while you posted a second URL and was
<br>
specifically discussing the second study.  I think this was a simple
<br>
misunderstanding.  I did not criticize the study you thought I did.  I have
<br>
no problems with the study that you seem to favor, and you do not seem to be
<br>
supporting the study that I criticized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am obviously missing something... I don't understand. You replied to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike and claimed that I was reinterpreting the &quot;studies&quot; (i.e. plural)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say the opposite of their results. What exactly were you talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about? Did you mean to say that I was reinterpreting what the news
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article said?
</em><br>
<p>I thought you were claiming that both studies, including the first one,
<br>
supported the Paleo Diet.  The Paleo Diet forbids eating grains and cereals.
<br>
The first study found good results with people eating high-fiber diets
<br>
including grains and cereals.  It seemed that these positions were in
<br>
conflict:  eating grains is good versus eating grains is bad.  That was my
<br>
complaint.  It now appears that maybe my criticism and your support may have
<br>
been directed at different studies within the same article.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I clearly stated in my original post to Bill K that I was discussing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying studies, not the BH article. I even mentioned going to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web pages of them. So I am still not understanding your complaints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding my post.
</em><br>
<p>As you pointed out above, &quot;studies&quot; (i.e. plural)....  I am not sure now if
<br>
you supported the first study or not, or if you thought it supported the
<br>
Paleo Diet.  I think we are agreed that high-fiber is good, and that the
<br>
Paleo Diet is high fiber.  So in that sense, we agree on the nutritional
<br>
aspects of fiber.
