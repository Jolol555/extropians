<p>Mike, I was unaware of this acronym, but have probably been in
<br>
communication with some of the people behind the project due to
<br>
their interest in Nano@Home [so the information is useful].  The
<br>
authors have indicated to me that things are moving along on
<br>
that project.
<br>
<p>For people unaware of it -- Nano@Home is a project I proposed a
<br>
couple of years ago to promote DC for the sake of accelerating
<br>
nanoscale design.  The proposal itself is at:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Proposals/NanoAtHome.html">http://www.aeiveos.com/~bradbury/Proposals/NanoAtHome.html</a>
<br>
<p>Due to the support of a very energetic individual in Italy
<br>
(Andrea Fois), there has actually been recent progress on the
<br>
project.  There is now a web site (<a href="http://www.nanoathome.org/">http://www.nanoathome.org/</a>)
<br>
and several discussion forums (that can be reached from the
<br>
home page).  I'm still getting used to the PHPBB interface
<br>
but it seems like it should be fine to support a Nano@Home
<br>
community.
<br>
<p>Noting Harvey's comments essentially about &quot;what are we really
<br>
*doing*&quot; (other than cheerleading) both Folding@Home and Nano@Home
<br>
*are* something that people can contribute to.  People
<br>
who have computers can run DC software, people who program
<br>
can contribute that expertise; people who don't program can
<br>
contribute to writing FAQs documenting their own gradual
<br>
understanding of the DC project and how newbies can get
<br>
involved; people with very visual minds can contribute
<br>
&quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot; images of understanding.
<br>
Lots of people can define what they can contribute.
<br>
<p>What is important is understanding what it is all about,
<br>
contributing some small part of your time and energy,
<br>
and sharing the excitement with others.
<br>
<p>For example, most people do not know this, but to design the
<br>
Fine Motion Controller (<a href="http://www.imm.org/Parts/Parts2.html">http://www.imm.org/Parts/Parts2.html</a>)
<br>
only required a couple of months of time on the part
<br>
of Ralph Merkle and Eric Drexler.  The FMC contains
<br>
slightly less than 2600 atoms.  It is also perhaps one
<br>
of the most brilliant molecular parts known to humanity
<br>
(perhaps up there with DNA &amp; RNA polymerases and the ribosome).
<br>
<p>One of the most complex chemical synthesis ever accomplished
<br>
to date is for Vitamin B-12 which contains 181 atoms.  But
<br>
it was accomplished by 2 professors and a few more
<br>
graduate students.  So our chemical synthesis
<br>
capabilities are within an order of magnitude
<br>
of being capable of synthesizing what would be
<br>
huge breakthrough in field of nanotechnology with
<br>
a team of perhaps 20-40 individuals.  [Once the FMC
<br>
is synthesized then the critics of the feasibility of
<br>
molecular nanotechnology are going to be on the run.]
<br>
<p>The reason Nano@Home is important is to design nanoscale
<br>
parts that are more simple than the FMC [one might like
<br>
to walk before one runs in terms of complex nanoscale
<br>
chemical synthesis].
<br>
<p>So I would urge any of you who want to do more than cheerleading
<br>
(which isn't bad but can be frustrating if done for extended
<br>
periods IMO) to cruise on over to the Nano@Home site, get
<br>
involved in the discussions, read the background materials,
<br>
install the Berkely software when it becomes available (to
<br>
allocate your computer resources to various worthwhile DC
<br>
projects), enroll your friends in the efforts (even if they
<br>
think extropians are a bit strange -- it isn't hard to come
<br>
up with reasons to support Folding@Home or Nano@Home that
<br>
make sense to most reasonable people), etc.
<br>
<p>There *are* things we can do.
<br>
