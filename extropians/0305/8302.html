<p>
This for me was one of the most conclusive pieces of evidence that much of 
<br>
the news coverage of the war was little more than Theatrics and propaganda.
<br>
I watched all the live coverage the night Jessica Lynch was Ahem... 
<br>
'rescued'. I saw the breaking news reports, as the word spread. Most 
<br>
important of all, I saw the live broadcast from the hospital barley a few 
<br>
hours after it happened. This was shown on SKY news. I didn't see any US 
<br>
correspondents at the hospital, despite switching between CNN and FOX. 
<br>
Strange as Fox is SKY's sister company. 
<br>
The reporter interviewed several eye witnesses, including Dr Houssona. They 
<br>
all said the same thing. The US special forces burst in shouting and 
<br>
screaming, firing around the rooms and snatched her while everyone just 
<br>
watched in amazement.
<br>
They said she had been brought in by Iraqi troops who had left without 
<br>
questioning her several days before. She had been very well cared for and was 
<br>
treated better than the other patients at the hospital. They also said that 
<br>
most of the time she was there, she cried on her bed saying she just wanted 
<br>
to go home. 
<br>
<p>Strangely this footage was only shown a couple of times later that hour and 
<br>
then wasn't shown again. Also, very strange that an allegedly 'Heavily 
<br>
defended' area was completely free of any iraqi soldiers. So much so, that 
<br>
the film crew were able to drive to the hospital without seeing any, and were 
<br>
free to walk around interviewing whoever they pleased.
<br>
<p>Later in the day General Brooks gave his briefing and played it up as if they 
<br>
had repeated the Mogadishu mile and taken on the entire Iraqi army, just to 
<br>
save her.
<br>
It made me laugh out loud.
<br>
<p>Im in no doubt that the rescue operation would have been planned to a high 
<br>
degree and that the forces involved executed it as they would any rescue in 
<br>
hostile territory. I can also believe that the Doctors and people at the 
<br>
hospital could elaborate about the events. At the end of it, It just added 
<br>
more proof that you shouldn't believe a damn thing, unless you see it with 
<br>
your own eyes.
<br>
<p>As for Jessica being a hero. In my book, anyone that put their life on the 
<br>
line for their country is a hero. She should be proud of that.
<br>
What happened in Nasiriya, was just the retrieval of a scared girl who 
<br>
shouldn't have been captured in the first place. I think there are many other 
<br>
people who are more deserving of the title 'Hero.'

<br>
But Iraqi doctors in Nasiriya say they provided the
<br>
best treatment they could for the soldier in the midst
<br>
of war. She was assigned the only specialist bed in
<br>
the hospital and one of only two nurses on the floor. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I examined her, I saw she had a broken arm, a broken
<br>
thigh and a dislocated ankle,&quot; said Dr Harith
<br>
a-Houssona, who looked after her. 
<br>
<p>&quot;There was no [sign of] shooting, no bullet inside her
<br>
body, no stab wound - only road traffic accident. They
<br>
want to distort the picture. I don't know why they
<br>
think there is some benefit in saying she has a bullet
<br>
injury.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Witnesses told us that the special forces knew that
<br>
the Iraqi military had fled a day before they swooped
<br>
on the hospital. 
<br>
<p>Dr Uday was surprised by the manner of the rescue 
<br>
&quot;We were surprised. Why do this? There was no
<br>
military, there were no soldiers in the hospital,&quot;
<br>
said Dr Anmar Uday, who worked at the hospital. 
<br>
<p>........snip
<br>
<p>General Vincent Brooks
<br>
<p><p>When footage of the rescue was released, General
<br>
Vincent Brooks, US spokesman in Doha, said: &quot;Some
<br>
brave souls put their lives on the line to make this
<br>
happen, loyal to a creed that they know that they'll
<br>
never leave a fallen comrade.&quot;
