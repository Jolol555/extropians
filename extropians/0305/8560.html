If any of you believe in the illusion of free &amp; fair elections, i would
<br>
encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.blackboxvoting.com/">http://www.blackboxvoting.com/</a> and go to
<br>
www.linkcrusader.com AND PAGE DOWN ) to the **** MANY links about vote
<br>
fraud, whistleblowers, &quot;faulty&quot; software. The last senatorial elections were
<br>
stolen at Least in GA - look at the poll swings from 3-5 days pre-election
<br>
in several key states to how the vote turned out. VERY interesting that
<br>
voter news service decided at the last minute to drop exit polls. AMazing
<br>
that the DNC can't get to see the code in the voting machines. WHY don't
<br>
more dems scream about vote fraud? I asked a 30 yr dem. party strategist
<br>
this question, and he simply told me that the dems are also guilty of it -
<br>
i.e. possibly the Kennedy election, Daley, many others.
<br>
****anyway, if someone could really read this stuff, digest it, then
<br>
convince me that the black boxes are to be trusted, i would WORSHIP YOU! I
<br>
would love to believe we live in a democracy (if only because i am sick of
<br>
all the hypocrites &amp; liars who bleat about freedom &amp; democracy while doing
<br>
everything they can to take away civil rights &amp; destroy actual democracy at
<br>
home &amp; abroad ), Of course, while i'm at it I may as well believe in god and
<br>
convince myself that putting my faith in father figure bush or mama gore is
<br>
somehow an appropriate transference of the belief that &quot;our
<br>
father/mother-god-president&quot;  gives a shit about my personal well being.
<br>
HELLO? We live under a corporatized militarized mafia not a gov. of by &amp; for
<br>
the people. Picture distant, selfish father/mother - like Enron CEO - not a
<br>
loving parent. We are like enron employees marching along to the trumpeted
<br>
shouts of &quot;glory glory hail the loot yall&quot;.           NO! you scream, Santa
<br>
really does exist! Isn't it ironic (hypocritical? lying?) that i tell my son
<br>
that Santa &amp; God both exist. But someday he will have to grow up. Anyway,
<br>
enough ranting - in geological time it doesn't matter anyway.
<br>
<p>Regarding Jeb Bush's purging of the voter rolls in FL - the bush family has
<br>
a long term connection with the company that &quot;accidentally&quot; purged many
<br>
thousands from the rolls - many who had NO criminal record. Remember also
<br>
that in FL at least, many &quot;democrats&quot; are democrats only in name so that
<br>
they can get the black /minority/poor votes - just because someone calls
<br>
themself a &quot;democrat&quot; doesn't mean they prefer Gore over Bush. (ever hear of
<br>
a &quot;reagan democrat&quot;?)
