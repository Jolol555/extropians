Mike Lorrey wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; I distinctly recall seeing articles in Newsweek and other magazines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hardly to be described as moderate or conservative in editorial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda) about the protests against bath houses being closed by health
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officials in cities like San Francisco,
</em><br>
<p>This is totally different than opposing a medical quarantine which is what
<br>
you originally claimed.  A quarantine should try to isolate only those
<br>
infected with the virus.  Shutting down gay establishments isolates
<br>
noninfected gays as well.  I can see why some could object to this while not
<br>
objecting to a real medical quarantine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; HIV positive status is treated today unlike testing positive for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other disease. It is treated only as an issue of individual concern. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a result, we have positive individuals going around infecting others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for years, even when they are aware of their positive status, and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partners are considered to have no right to know.
</em><br>
<p>How is this any different than any other sexually transmitted disease?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the first prosecutions of such individuals was attempted, gay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights groups went up in arms over even this, as if gays alone have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to kill innocent people.
</em><br>
<p>Evidence, please?  I don't recall gay activists arguing for the right to
<br>
infect innocent people or try to kill them.  Remember that I lived through
<br>
this movement you are recalling.  It would be like me telling a Viet Nam vet
<br>
what really happened in the fox-holes.  Do you really believe that gay
<br>
rights advocates demanded the right to infect people or kill people?  This
<br>
seems preposterous on the face of it.  I am certain that this story has been
<br>
&quot;interpreted&quot; from a conservative commentator.  I would sure love to see
<br>
references and examine the original source for this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Individuals even have the right to donate blood while positive, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the onus on the blood banks to test every pint that comes in, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; praying that they don't get a false negative.
</em><br>
<p>This is bogus.  Evidence please?  As gay person, I have been blocked from
<br>
giving blood for decades.  In Florida, there is a form they show you that
<br>
says if you have had even protected gay sex 15 years ago, they do not want
<br>
your blood.  Now someone can always lie and give blood.  But I know of no
<br>
&quot;right&quot; to declare you are HIV positive and give blood anyway.  It simply
<br>
doesn't exist, at least not in my state.
<br>
<p>As for the onus of testing being on the blood bank, that only makes sense.
<br>
We certainly don't want to rely on donors to keep the blood supply safe.  I
<br>
wouldn't want it any other way.  I don't know why you bemoan blood testing
<br>
as if it were an onus caused by gay rights.  I think testing blood before
<br>
infusing it into someone is just simple medical safety.  I would demand such
<br>
for myself as a health advocate, not as a gay activist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Conversely, lets look, for example, at gun owners: we don't protest the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prosecution of criminals who use guns in crime, we celebrate it.
</em><br>
<p>Give me a break!  What about when the laws being violated are gun-control
<br>
laws, record keeping laws, waiting period laws, underage laws, storage laws,
<br>
or access by minors laws?  These are constantly being protested and fought
<br>
by the NRA.  I can't believe you think that gun owners don't protest against
<br>
laws they don't like or support &quot;criminals&quot; who break these unjust laws.
<br>
Gun owners and the NRA are no different than any other political lobbying
<br>
group that is trying to overturn laws they don't like.
