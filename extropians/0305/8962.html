<p>
Oops, sorry about the truncated message.  Let's try again.
<br>
<p>Several people have speculated about what Lee Corbin calls the &quot;annoying
<br>
result&quot; discussed in Robin Hanson's paper at
<br>
<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf</a>.  I would refer to it rather as
<br>
a marvelously surprising and paradoxical discovery that strongly
<br>
challenges our understanding of our own thought processes.  I have
<br>
tried to understand it in different ways and from different directions.
<br>
Here is a new take on it.
<br>
<p>We are accustomed to taking a rather parochial and self-centered view
<br>
of the world.  Indeed, our very nature is such that this viewpoint is
<br>
almost impossible to escape.  But to understand this result, you have to
<br>
try to think in a more general and universal manner.  &quot;Free your mind&quot;,
<br>
as they said in the first Matrix movie.  Try to reason not just from your
<br>
own personal perspective, but from a point of view which sees everyone's
<br>
opinions in an objective and unbiased manner.
<br>
<p>Imagine two people, A and B, coming together to discuss a contentious
<br>
issue.  You are a telepathic third party, an objective, rational observer
<br>
who has full access to the content of their minds.  You can see all
<br>
of the memories, experiences, opinions, and goals of both of them.
<br>
You are free of prejudices of your own and are just going to reason
<br>
logically based on the information you receive from A and B.
<br>
<p>It seems clear that you will be able to put that information together and
<br>
come to a conclusion about the issue in question.  You will be able to
<br>
judge which side of the issue is more likely to be true.  This is based
<br>
on the information you get from A and B.  Even where their information
<br>
is contradictory based on different experiences, you will be able to
<br>
judge the relative accuracy of the different information that they
<br>
have received.
<br>
<p>Now, you've done this as an objective observer.  But the point is, either
<br>
A or B could have done the same thing, if they had had the same kind of
<br>
access you did.  This is the key, that A and B, if they fully understood
<br>
the mind of the other and their reasons for holding their opinions, would
<br>
come to the same conclusion about the issue.  It is the same conclusion that
<br>
you came to, because it is based on the same information (that is, the
<br>
total information of A+B), along with logic and reason.
<br>
<p>Therefore, if you fully understood the mind of another, and he fully
<br>
understood you, and both of you were rational, you would not be able to
<br>
disagree about any factual matter.
<br>
<p>That's the first step.  The result that Robin discusses goes farther,
<br>
and arises even without the need for magical telepathic understanding.
<br>
But the foundation is the belief which you both have, that if you did
<br>
have full access to all of the information the other guy has, you would
<br>
both agree.
<br>
<p>Given that you both know this, if you disagree initially, you must realize
<br>
that it is something of an artifact caused by incomplete information.
<br>
And a priori there is no particular reason to suppose that one party
<br>
or the other is more likely to hold the position which you would both
<br>
eventually come to agree on.  In particular, you should have no prejudice
<br>
that you are likely to be right, just because you are you; for you would
<br>
understand that such reasoning is equally applicable to the other side,
<br>
and so this reasoning predicts that each side is more likely to be right,
<br>
which is impossible.
<br>
<p>Now, you may have particular reasons to believe that you are more
<br>
likely to be right; maybe you have unusually high-quality information
<br>
about this issue; or maybe you are more likely to be right about things
<br>
than the average human.  But it's possible that the other person shares
<br>
these attributes, too, perhaps even to a greater degree than you.
<br>
<p>As you discuss the issue, you may be reluctant to change your mind, if
<br>
you have some of the reasons above to believe that you are likely to be
<br>
right.  On the other hand, if it is an issue about which you know little,
<br>
you might be relatively willing to switch sides.  So what should happen
<br>
is as the discussion goes on, the reluctance by the other party to switch
<br>
sends a signal that the quality of their information is good.  With
<br>
continued discussion, eventually one side should rationally conclude that
<br>
the other side's information is of higher quality than their own, and
<br>
switch sides, so that they eventually agree.
<br>
<p>The basic result, which goes back to the 1970s, is that you can't
<br>
rationally &quot;agree to disagree&quot;, that is, to each hold to opposing
<br>
positions which you will not change.  This is true even though you both
<br>
know that if you both knew what the other knew, one of you would change
<br>
his mind (the mind-reading scenario).  The only way you can refuse to
<br>
change even in the face of continued refusal by the other side is if you
<br>
have infinitely strong grounds to hold your position, which is impossible.
<br>
<p>Now, you may have found yourself in situations like this, where you
<br>
were faced with a seemingly rational opponent but you simply could not
<br>
accept that his position might be right.  In that case, you probably
<br>
told yourself that he was being emotional, or stubborn, or stupid,
<br>
or manipulative, or for some other reason was acting irrationally.
<br>
You did not truly believe that he was acting as a rational truth-seeker.
<br>
If you did think that, I believe you would find it much more difficult
<br>
to accept the &quot;agree to disagree&quot; outcome.  There is a fundamental
<br>
contradiction in adopting that position if both sides know each other
<br>
to be rational and honest.
<br>
