<p><p>From PlayStation to Supercomputer for $50,000
<br>
<p><p>By JOHN MARKOFF
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;As perhaps the clearest evidence yet of the computing power of 
<br>
sophisticated but inexpensive video-game consoles, the National Center for Supercomputing 
<br>
Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has assembled a 
<br>
supercomputer from an army of Sony PlayStation 2's.
<br>
<p>The resulting system, with components purchased at retail prices, cost a 
<br>
little more than $50,000. The center's researchers believe the system may be 
<br>
capable of a half trillion operations a second, well within the definition of 
<br>
supercomputer, although it may not rank among the world's 500 fastest 
<br>
supercomputers.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of the project, which uses the open source 
<br>
Linux operating system, is that the only hardware engineering involved was 
<br>
placing 70 of the individual game machines in a rack and plugging them together 
<br>
with a high-speed HP network switch. The center's scientists bought 100 
<br>
machines, but are holding 30 in reserve, possibly for high-resolution display 
<br>
application.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;It took a lot of time because you have to cut all of these things out of the 
<br>
plastic packaging,&quot; said Craig Steffen, a senior research scientist at the 
<br>
center, who is one of four scientists working part time on the project.
<br>
<p>The scientists are taking advantage of a standard component of the Sony 
<br>
video-game console that was originally intended to move and transform pixels 
<br>
rapidly on a television screen to produce lifelike graphics. The chip is not the 
<br>
PlayStation 2's MIPS microprocessor, but rather a graphics co-processor known as 
<br>
the Emotion Engine. That custom designed silicon chip is capable of producing 
<br>
up to 6.5 billion mathematical operations a second.
<br>
<p>The impressive performance of the game machine, which has been on the market 
<br>
for a few years, underscores a radical shift that has taken place in the 
<br>
computing world since the end of the cold war in the late 1980's, according to the 
<br>
researchers.
<br>
<p>While the most advanced computing technologies have historically been 
<br>
developed first for large corporate users and military contractors, increasingly the 
<br>
fastest computers are being developed for the consumer market and for products 
<br>
meant to be placed under Christmas trees. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If you look at the economics of game platforms and the power of computing on 
<br>
toys, this is a long-term market trend and computing trend,&quot; said Dan Reed, 
<br>
the supercomputing center's director. &quot;The economics are just amazing. This is 
<br>
going to drive the next big wave in high-performance computing.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;
