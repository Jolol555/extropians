<p>I'm glad you think so.

<p>25% of the entire American population is huge number of people! I'm sure the
<br>
Tonight Show ratings are good, but not that good. 
<br>
<p>Getting back to the subject, I just think it's a bit silly to suggest that
<br>
late night comedians like Jay Leno have some kind of liberal political
<br>
agenda. (I was a little hard on Mike in my last post for this reason. Sorry
<br>
Mike). I think any late night comedy fan like me can see that guys like
<br>
Leno, O'Brian and Letterman have anything BUT a political agenda. They
<br>
respect no political party. Their only agenda is to make people laugh. That
<br>
is what they do best. It's why they get paid the big bucks. 
<br>
<p>I think Jay Leno would crack a joke about his own mother if he thought it
<br>
would get a laugh from the audience. In fact he probably has.
