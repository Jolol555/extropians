<em>&gt; This seems to me like you want democracy when it suits you

</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed its probably human nature, and what many of us want much

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your signature quote &quot;Live free or die, death is not the worst of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evils&quot; is probably a maxim that would find a lot of sympathy amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who attacked America on September 11. Can the human

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it something fundamental and resilient? 
</em><br>
<p>The US was once a nation where half the states were 'untrustable' in
<br>
that they legalized slavery. In order to rectify this situation, we had
<br>
a civil war that cost 300,000 lives and maimed millions.
<br>
<p>If the US were to admit other nations as 'states' into our union, they
<br>
would have to entirely rewrite their 'state' constitutions (assuming
<br>
they had one to start with) else we would be faced with fighting a
<br>
worldwide civil war again some time in the future.
<br>
<p>Were we to automatically admit more countries to the union that had
<br>
more population than we currently have, their 'low trust' psychologies
<br>
would win out by dilution. The situation is already bad enough here
<br>
with our high rate of immigration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seems to me that if one plans to permanently cut out huge sections
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the human population from &quot;the good life&quot; AND lets then see that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is doing it, one had better be prepared for permanent war. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is no choice then perhaps the best one can do is face the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts and resolve to be a good fighter until one grows weary or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old or needs to sleep. But there is little peace in that. 
</em><br>
<p>No, there will always be wars so long as men are capable of evil, and
<br>
men unwilling to be ruled by evil.
