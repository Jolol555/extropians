<p>I think that it was Rafal who pointed out that cattle,
<br>
among other beasts, are maintained by humans.  In their
<br>
current state, they would not be able to survive in the
<br>
wilderness on their own.  I've certainly long supposed
<br>
that a true &quot;cattle agent&quot; or proponent, would be very
<br>
glad they were eaten by humans.  Aren't some species
<br>
protected right now by the hunters?
<br>
<p>Fancifully, let's suppose that civilization is abundant
<br>
in the universe, and that humans evolved on a &quot;reserve&quot;.
<br>
It's absolutely the case---this hypothesis goes---that
<br>
humans are *uncompetitive* in the universe.
<br>
<p>But our planet has just been sold, and the new owner
<br>
enjoys hunting humans.  So about a million people a year
<br>
(one in six-thousand) are scooped up by flying saucers,
<br>
and there isn't anything we can do about it.
<br>
<p>Well, I for one am still glad that we are at least of 
<br>
some value on the galactic market, and hope that the
<br>
galactic council doesn't pass a law against hunting
<br>
humans.  Woe is us if they do!
