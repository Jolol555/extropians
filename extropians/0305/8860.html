<br>
<p>This details that while HUAC members grandstanding brought its own
<br>
downfall, the Venona Files have confirmed that they were indeed onto
<br>
something. Further reading shows that late night comedienne Lucille
<br>
Ball was, in fact, registered as a member of the Communist Party, as
<br>
was her Cuban husband, Desi Arnaz.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, she signed a certificate as sponsor for a Communist
<br>
candidate, Emil Freed, for the California Assembly, 57th District and
<br>
that she was on the California State Central Committee of the Communist
<br>
Party in 1936.
<br>
<p>In 1951, the Daily Worker, the oficial newspaper of the Communist
<br>
Party, detailed her status and opposition to the HUAC.
<br>
<p>Lucille's membership was verified before the Dies Committee in 1940 by
<br>
Rena Vale, a Hollywood writer and admitted CP member, who attended CP
<br>
meetings at Ball's home.
<br>
<p>In her testimony before the HUAC, she tried to play the ditzy female
<br>
and claimed she wasn't political and that she only registered as a
<br>
Communist at the request of her grandfather. Why the dizty
<br>
non-political female would be on the State Central Committee, not just
<br>
a rank and file member or registed voter, is an interesting question,
<br>
don't you think?
<br>
<p>Dezi Arnaz, additionally, has his own record of Communist involvement:
<br>
<p>A February 28, 1946 issue of the &quot;California Eagle&quot;, an LA newspaper,
<br>
contained and article entitled &quot;Stars Intersperse Tals for FEPC on
<br>
Progrem at Shrine Auditorium Show&quot; (FEPC signifies the Fair Employment
<br>
Practices Commission). The article stated that Dezi Arnaz was one of
<br>
the many entertainers who appeared on the show which was sponsored by
<br>
the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and
<br>
Professions (ICCASP), a documented communist front organization.
<br>
<p>He was also involved in some unspecified CP activities at the
<br>
California Labor School, an institution designated by the AG and FBI
<br>
Director as a CP school. Further information on his activities there
<br>
was redacted from public HUAC files.
<br>
<p>So, you wanted evidence of a late night comedian, I give you two. Want
<br>
any more???
