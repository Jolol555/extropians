<em>&gt; Problems:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first point to make is that there was no single 'Paleolithic Diet'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just as desert Aborigines ate different foods to those who lived in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temperate coastal areas or in tropical rain forests, so too Paleolithic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diets varied considerably. The range of available foods varied not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geographically (ie, from one part of the world to another) but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seasonally. Unlike today, our early ancestors often had no choice but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat the food that was available in season.
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly true in many cases. For instance many primitive peoples 
<br>
develop methods of storing their preferred foods for lengthy periods of 
<br>
time. One example is the buffalo pemmican food developed by the plains 
<br>
indians... often stayed good for years. Also of note is there have been 
<br>
comparative studies done on the health and performance abilities of 
<br>
various primitive peoples, in some cases who lived near each other. In 
<br>
general, the ones who lived primarily on meats always were healthier and 
<br>
outperformed athletically those who lived mostly on non-meat foods. So 
<br>
perhaps there is an &quot;ideal&quot; paleo diet, or at least we can eventually 
<br>
determine what is best by working out the details via traditional 
<br>
nutritional science filling in the blanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If primitives lived near water, they probably ate lots of fish instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of meat. It is more likely they ate meat only when they were lucky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to catch it.
</em><br>
<p>Well you can look at the eskimos.. they hunt before the winter and store 
<br>
the food to live off of later. I don't think the diet varies much- at 
<br>
least if they are living traditionally. Maybe they are too &quot;modern&quot; 
<br>
though to use as an example?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gts likes skinless lean chicken breasts. Nothing wrong with that, except
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a caveman is more likely to have thrown it to the dogs. In hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times, primitive people would eat the whole animal. In good times they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted the fattest animals in the herd.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, and remain unconvinced regarding the focus on primarily lean 
<br>
meats in some paleo diet formulations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most nutritionists say that avoiding all grains, especially whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grains, as well as beans, is unwise. You shouldn't overeat refined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grains, but there is no reason to totally avoid all grains and beans.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it is an unnecessary risk? For instance, read up on the possible 
<br>
connections between these types of foods and various autoimmune diseases:
<br>
<a href="http://www.beyondveg.com/cordain-l/grains-leg/grains-legumes-1b.shtml">http://www.beyondveg.com/cordain-l/grains-leg/grains-legumes-1b.shtml</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, avoiding all milk and dairy products is also unwise. Low-fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and non-fat dairy products are healthy and nutritious. The paleo diet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims that you can get all the calcium you need from vegetables, nuts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fish (eaten with bones). That is indeed possible, but most modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans simply will not get enough calcium from non-dairy sources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (unless they also take a supplement).
</em><br>
<p>Well your logic appears to be bit circuitous here... if Americans /were/ 
<br>
eating a paleo diet, they /would/ be getting enough calcium without 
<br>
having to rely on dairy.
<br>
<p>I will say here, like with the idea of eating mainly low-fat meats, I am 
<br>
not convinced yet that this is the best dietary choice. Especially eggs 
<br>
are an excellent nutritional source from what I can tell... I think most 
<br>
paleo diets DO allow them though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even paleo enthusiasts recognise that this diet is not well-suited to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the needs of endurance athletes. Athletes need to fuel optimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance and recovery, so workouts can be repeated after a relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short time. Endurance athletes have a critical need to replenish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glycogen stores immediately after exercise. For this reason, the diet is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modified to permit sugar and starch, but only during and after exercise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Recovery is one thing, but the actual endurance performance is another. 
<br>
During a lengthy endurance event, the body clearly is going to quickly 
<br>
exhaust its stores of glycogen, even if they are artificially pumped up 
<br>
by &quot;carb loading&quot;, and if it cannot operate well on the alternate fat 
<br>
burning energy system then the athlete will &quot;hit the wall&quot;. There have 
<br>
been studies done on this, and also historical evidence, that show 
<br>
training on a high fat diet can greatly extend the length of time 
<br>
athletes can perform. And if you get good enough at using your fat for 
<br>
energy in this way, to the point that your body naturally prefers to use 
<br>
it, there is much less of a need to refuel your glycogen stores in the 
<br>
first place I would guess.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Very few hunter-gatherers, whatever they ate, suffered from &quot;diseases of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization&quot; such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn’t live long enough to develop them. Their diet never had to evolve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to solve the problems of middle and old age. But almost certainly many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribes suffered from deficiency diseases and starvation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It is possible to compare biomarkers and risks of developing various 
<br>
diseases of civilization between groups at the kinds of ages typically 
<br>
observed in primitive people. Evidence seems to say that at least at 
<br>
these age levels, western diet is a complete disaster.
