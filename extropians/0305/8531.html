<em>&gt; Well, that I *didn't* know.  CAT'S CRADLE executes the Big Lie?  As I         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall, the great scientist (\&quot;any scientist who cannot explain what he       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is doing to an eight-year old is a charlatan\&quot;) creates ice-nine, and         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a lot of anti-science propaganda woven into the story, but I         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't recall anything about \&quot;soma\&quot; (those little lies that are necessary    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in life) being done in emulation of Plato.  But it's been almost 35 years.    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm guessing it was the Prophet Bokonon and the other guy, forgot his name,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who was the military dictator of the island where Cat's Cradle is set. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started as best buddies but were pretending to be enemies so the people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have an outlet for their rebellious urges.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yes.  Sounds right.  BTW, I was wrong about &quot;soma&quot;; got the term
<br>
confused with Brave New World, I guess.  The harmless lies in Cat's
<br>
Cradle are called &quot;foma&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, it is too bad Vonnegut and a lot of other science fiction writers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social commentators don't really &quot;get it&quot; as far as science goes.
</em><br>
<p>I am especially annoyed since I was a very impressionable 20 years old
<br>
when I read that, and it contributed to the malaise of the whole stupid
<br>
generation thing in 1968, which was very anti-science and anti-establishment
<br>
(e.g., studying and doing your homework and playing &quot;the man's&quot; game).
