We've talked a lot about Jared Diamond here, but I think a great
<br>
perspective on this comes from Robert Wright.  In _Non-Zero_ he
<br>
suggests that the most important effect of agriculture was to increase
<br>
the information density of human populations.  With greater population
<br>
density and more people freed up from subsistence hunter gathering,
<br>
agricultural societies gave way to a degree of idea-creation and
<br>
idea-sharing not before possible.  
<br>
<p>I like this analogy.  In some ways, agriculture was (at first) a net
<br>
negative for the /individuals/ in agricultural societies, but a
<br>
positive for the societies as meta-individuals.  
<br>
<p>I'd also note that even for individuals ancient societies had some
<br>
significant advantages.  Life expectancy in HG societies is believed
<br>
to have been around 18 years.  In ancient Rome it had gone up to
<br>
around 30 years.  While nutrition might have been poorer, agricultural
<br>
societies were capable of providing a higher and more consistent
<br>
caloric intake than HG societies.  Agricultural societies were also
<br>
better at protecting their members against predators and, of course,
<br>
against other humans.
<br>
