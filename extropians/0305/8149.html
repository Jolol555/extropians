<em>&gt; &gt; Two things are refreshing about Fox News (and at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or two newscasters on MSNBC):  they're not only providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; balance to ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN, but they're quite open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about it.  What I hate is people pretending they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objective, when they're not. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We disagree here (I think we covered this once before). Yes FOX is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blatantly right-wing, but it advertises itself as unbiased.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder how they would respond;  perhaps by saying that Hannity
<br>
is balanced by Colmes.  But if so, who balances O'Reilly?  Unless
<br>
someone can name another show on Fox hosted by someone as left-
<br>
leaning as O'Reilly is right, then I must agree with you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The FOX slogan, repeated many times each day, is something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;News Without the Spin,&quot; but in fact they offer more spin than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any network I've ever seen in all my life.
</em><br>
<p>I don't really know what they mean by &quot;News without the Spin&quot;.
<br>
A spinster is someone who interprets the news in a particular
<br>
direction, adding &quot;spin&quot;.  So if they mean that they don't have
<br>
an excess of conservatives interpreting the news and adding a
<br>
rightward spin, then they're not telling the truth.  But if
<br>
they mean merely that while reporting the news itself, it comes
<br>
without any inherent bias (that is, listening one cannot tell if
<br>
it's coming from a conservative or (American) liberal), then that's
<br>
a separate claim.  I couldn't swear that the *news* portion is
<br>
unbiased; it probably is biased.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cavuto and Hannity are like rabid junior Newt Gingrichs.
</em><br>
<p>Why are you descending to that in this particular conversation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The entire network is a joke,
</em><br>
<p>Why---some impulse that you cannot control?  Have you seen me
<br>
in this discussion, or do you expect to see me in this discussion,
<br>
take pot shots at the left?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; unless one goes in with one's eyes wide open and with full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge that one is about to get a thorough soaking in GOP politics. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is nothing wrong with advocacy journalism but FOX should be honest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it. In fact if I were a senior executive at FOX, I would give serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration to the idea of advertising the network for exactly what it is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a conservative republican oriented news network. The strategy would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase market share as conservative news consumers are starved for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something exactly like FOX. The conservative slant is the reason FOX has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been so successful: FOX fills a unique and important market niche. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Cable news networks are not obliged by law to serve the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; interest, which is one reason we see extreme advocacy journalism on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; cable like that which comes from FOX.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, we know how to fix that, don't we?  How about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nah. I want less regulation, not more.
</em><br>
<p>;-)  It's as if neither you nor Ron understood my sarcasm here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There are two basic factors:  (1) journalism schools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; indoctrinate their students like nobody's business---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conservative students are made to feel quite out of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and uncomfortable, and perhaps don't even make it through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unless they're careful  (2) the kind of people who go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into journalism often do so to &quot;change the world&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the kind of typical idealism so manifest among the young.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Conservatives tend to follow other paths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're ignoring the fierce competition between ABC, NBC and CBS for Neilson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratings and advertising dollars. I've worked in consumer market research and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can tell you that if the American people did not like liberal TV
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalists then their contracts would not be renewed; they would be fired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and replaced by conservatives at the first opportunity.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I don't swallow a bit of this.  There was no way, for example,
<br>
that CBS could have gotten rid of Cronkite and the huge network of
<br>
left-biased reporters around him.  Have you read Bernard Goldberg's
<br>
book &quot;BIAS&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However the majority of American people (not the majority of voters)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a liberal mindset, so the non-cable news media also has a liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mindset.  A huge fraction of Americans, something like 50%, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politically apathetic non-voters.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They tend to be liberal-minded people of low socioeconomic status.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think these apathetic people liberal?  I think them
<br>
to be almost completely non-ideological.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However those liberal-minded non-voters watch the evening news, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so along with politically active liberals they represent the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news consumers and so control the non-cable market for news. It's just free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterprise at work (ironically).
</em><br>
<p>We disagree; that's all I guess.
<br>
<p>Lee
