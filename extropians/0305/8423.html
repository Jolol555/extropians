<em>&gt; &gt; The rush to judgement that human release of carbon is causing

<em>&gt; &gt; scientific hypothesis yet, is it? Can you cite a paper from

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Non sequitur.  I never made this claim, nor do I intend to defend it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to have the situation backwards.  You are the one who posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the climatologists' data.  The data clearly shows the increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trend in tornadoes.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif">http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif</a>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You dispute this claim from the climatologists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the real question is, can YOU cite a paper from a climatologist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for YOUR claims?
</em><br>
<p>Why this demand for authority, Harvey? I have repeatedly posted
<br>
information from my climatologist cousin, Andrew, which you have either
<br>
ignored or disputed. Why change your stripes now?
<br>
<p>Andrew has demonstrated that the weather patterns covering North
<br>
America are part of what is called the North Atlantic Occillation,
<br>
which is related to El Nino/La Nina. An increase in tornados over land
<br>
in the south to midwest region of the US would not occur during a
<br>
period of warming. It would only occur during a period of cooling,
<br>
which the NOA is, in fact, entering and has been for the last two years
<br>
due to both cyclic inertia and the fact that the solar magnetic field
<br>
has flipped.
<br>
<p>In fact, looking at the weather patterns over north America during this
<br>
stormy period show a rather pronounced and unusual advance SOUTHWARD of
<br>
the jet stream, caused by an influx of COLD air from Canada.
<br>
<p>Tornados are caused by collision of air masses of significantly
<br>
different temperatures and humidity levels. We in the north east are
<br>
experiencing unseasonably cold weather right now, to the point where
<br>
large parts of Massachusetts, RI, Connecticutt, and southern NH had a
<br>
frost warning last night, a month into Spring.
<br>
<p>Since alleged global warming has occured mostly at the poles, with no
<br>
temperature increase at the equator, this would mean that the
<br>
temperature difference between the two extremes is decreasing, which
<br>
would result in LESS SEVERE storm activity, as we have seen with less
<br>
than half as many severe cyclones worldwide in the latter half of the
<br>
20th century as in the first half.
<br>
<p>If global warming were actually causing increases in tornado activity,
<br>
then you'd see &quot;Tornado Alley&quot; shift northwards into Canada as warm air
<br>
advanced northward to collide with northern air masses.
<br>
<p>Instead, what we are seeing is an increase in activity caused by the
<br>
North Atlantic Occilation, a phenomenon which is responsible for much
<br>
of the warming in North America and Europe over the last 20-30 years.
<br>
We are now headed into a period of cooling which will last a similar
<br>
period. Whether there is any net positive temperature difference at the
<br>
end of a full cycle of the NAO remains to be seen, but the data claimed
<br>
by pro-global warming climatologists generally contradicts both real
<br>
observations as well as the alleged conclusions.
