Some people who know better refer to &quot;God&quot; because they understand the
<br>
political importance of this in gaining wide support for their plans and
<br>
goals.  The use of metaphor can be an effective tool for connecting with
<br>
people who don't yet have the background knowledge to appreciate the bigger
<br>
picture, and can be used with integrity in such cases.
<br>
<p>I think he knows very well what he's doing, and has the potential and
<br>
likelihood of making a substantial contribution to humanity.
<br>
<p>Conversely,  a recurring theme on the extropians list is that of extremely
<br>
bright persons performing feats of intellectual magic but lacking the
<br>
ability to garner support and  --- accomplish ---  tasks requiring more than
<br>
individual effort.
<br>
<p>These same persons often try to disguise their lack of effective people
<br>
skills by projecting arrogance, use of obscure language and references, and
<br>
sarcasm.  None of which is apparent in young Greg Smith's writings, web
<br>
site, speech, or appearance.  In my opinion, here's someone worth watching,
<br>
and perhaps helping.
