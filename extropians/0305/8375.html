<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; when I was in junior high school, I supposed that leftists were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the left of liberals, and rightists to the right of conservatives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More than one axis, remember?
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  But then Eternal Truth #2 is &quot;every statement
<br>
must be further modified&quot;.  The first axis grabs a huge
<br>
percentage of the truth; each additional axis adds more.
<br>
Finally, each separate person at each separate moment in
<br>
his or her life demands an &quot;axis&quot; or account.  Everything
<br>
that we are going to say, or even conceive of, outside of
<br>
mathematics is an approximation.
<br>
<p>Switching over to the environment, Lee Daniel Crocker wrote
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's not forget our history: the EPA was created by a Republican
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congress under a Republican president, and was an outgrowth of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the &quot;conservation&quot; movement that was decidedly conservative (in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dictionary sense of the word). What happened is that later
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administrations seized its power and used it to regulate big
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;business to death, and spun the rhetoric that industry and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;technology were anti-environment, and the public bought it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservatives are against what it became, not what it was.
<br>
<p>Yes, but as for me (Lee Corbin), well, I'm the baby-eating type
<br>
of anti-environmentalist, and could give a bad name to other
<br>
libertarians or conservatives like Lee Daniel, or those Republicans.
<br>
<p>Damien now writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The historical roots of environmentalism are about not poisoning our ecosystem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and about not making valuable or interesting species extinct.  About
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing damage.  Think _Silent Spring_.  Yes, there's a Gaia-worshipping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strand around these days too, and it can be vocal, but it's a mistake to focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much on it.  For me environmentalism is about whether I can see mountains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are six miles away.  (In Pasadena you often can't, due to smog.)  Clean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air, clean water.  Not fouling our cage like rats.
</em><br>
<p>I just don't care.  It has never mattered to me whether the air
<br>
is dirty or clean (although when I do want to use a telescope,
<br>
yeah, it's annoying).  Maybe it's because I grew up in Riverside,
<br>
the smog capital of the west coast, and thought it was natural
<br>
that your eyes would sting if you were outside very long (which
<br>
I tried to avoid anyway, for other reasons), or that your lungs
<br>
would hurt in a peculiar fashion after you ran a ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I've known nature lovers who would hate a desert area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to become forested &quot;because all the desert life would die&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (showing that the increase in total life didn't appeal that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much to them).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Desert life has appeal of its own.  There're value in diversity, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding monocultures.  Deserts are rarely dead, although some may be.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But on a volume per volume basis, how do you rank 10^6 cubic
<br>
meters of
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Desert ecology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Coral
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Forest ecology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Human habitation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;E. Human brains
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Uploaded humans with 10^8 times the density?
<br>
<p>Doesn't the use of 3D space get better the further down on
<br>
this list we go?
<br>
<p>I'm afraid that with such choices both current and in sight,
<br>
I just don't care about nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What is &quot;ecological capital&quot;, in economic terms?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The economic services provided by nature, like oxygen, or regulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; floods.  Or the cost of replacing those services with technology.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, thanks.  I understand.  But do recall that if nature stopped
<br>
producing oxygen, we'd still have enough in our atmosphere for 
<br>
another 50,000 years at current human and animal consumption.
<br>
As for the rest of nature, as soon as we can use the raw material
<br>
to support intelligence instead, the better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And how would you characterize acid rain, or loss of life due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smog, or having to avoid eating too much otherwise-healthy fish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of mercury buildup, or loss of life or having to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful outside because of ozone layer damage and increase in skin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancer?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think of acid rain as inconveniencing humans
<br>
at all (and weren't the reports of damage overblown anyway?).
<br>
Does smog really kill people?  I didn't know.  Or is this one
<br>
of those cases where extremely old people live a few days
<br>
less when viewed with very large numbers?  Also, I don't
<br>
think that danger to the ozone layer is real; do you think
<br>
that it has been definitely concluded that it is?
