<p>Falseness: I remember reading of a study a few years ago trying to do
<br>
regression on political positions, and finding that a large chunk, maybe a
<br>
majority, of the variance could be explained by a single dimension, giving
<br>
some suport to the traditional spectrum.
<br>
<p>OTOH, it wasn't an overwhelming majority -- 60%, maybe? -- leaving a lot of
<br>
room for fuzziness and error.
<br>
<p>OTGrippingH, there is at least one psych experiment where a group of people is
<br>
split up randomly with each person being assigned one of two labels; the two
<br>
utterly artificial and baseless tribes then start exhibiting distressingly
<br>
tribal behavior.  To me this suggest that just because we see humans cluster
<br>
needn't mean there's a coherent reason for the clustering.
<br>
<p>And so we find things like war on drugs cutting across the spectrum, with
<br>
defectors from both of the main sides, as I've said.  And both sides get their
<br>
litmus issues, and look oddly at someone who tries to hang out but disagrees
<br>
with something, like gun control.
