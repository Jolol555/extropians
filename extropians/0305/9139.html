<p><em>&gt; Does your example or your argument gain power when it is couched an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offensive manner?  No I didn't misunderstand anything.  You have made
</em><br>
yourself &gt; very clear.  You feel prerfectly justified in insulting people
<br>
that you have
<br>
<em>&gt; never had offend you in any way.
</em><br>
<p>What was offensive about what I said?  The example of Cassie Bernall came to
<br>
my mind when I gave my example of when I would lie.  The incident was well
<br>
reported in 1999 when the Columbine School shootings took place, and there
<br>
are many references to it on the Internet, such as:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.activeparenting.com/Magazine/fall99_1.htm">http://www.activeparenting.com/Magazine/fall99_1.htm</a>
<br>
<p>There are allegations that the incident which was widely reported to have
<br>
happened never actually happened (similar to the recent Jessica Lynch
<br>
story), but I'm not here to argue that.  The question of &quot;what would I do if
<br>
this happened to me - lie or tell the truth? - if a gun were pointed at me&quot;
<br>
was inspired by what happened in real life to Cassie Bernal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Olga, in North America if you hear the pounding of hooves you expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horses not zebra.  One or more German troops wear belt buckle in the 1930s
</em><br>
or &gt; 40s that offends you so that you are entitled to gratuitiously insult
<br>
every
<br>
<em>&gt; religious Christian or Jew in North America over there having a different
</em><br>
view of
<br>
<em>&gt; the world than you?
</em><br>
<p>The link I provided talked about much more than belt buckles.  It talked
<br>
about the historical Christian persecution of Jews.  What do  you have to
<br>
say about that?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I ask you what you even know of &quot;religious nuts&quot; ...
</em><br>
<p>Lots.  Oh, off the top of my head ... recently, of course, we have Osama Bin
<br>
Laden; Sharon of Israel would qualify;  pilot Gameel el-Batouty who
<br>
purposefully crashed  Egypt Air Flight 990 in 1999 (full of innocent
<br>
passengers) all the while saying &quot;Tawakilt ala Allah&quot; (&quot;I put my faith in
<br>
the hands of God&quot;) over and over again; parents who, because of their
<br>
religious beliefs, prohibit life-saving medicine to save their kids; and who
<br>
can forget Jim Jones?; or Torquemada?   Better yet, here are some links:

<p><em>&gt; which ones threatened you personally that you can insult all of us because
</em><br>
we may &gt; (or may not) see the world differently?
<br>
<p>I ... insult you?  I'm sorry you feel that way.  My doubt, apparently, is
<br>
what insults you.  Unfortunately, it is the nature of religions (and the
<br>
religious) to feel insulted when someone questions their beliefs.  That's
<br>
not something I have any control over, but I will not stop questioning your
<br>
beliefs (and it is my right to do so in the U.S.A. - at least for now).  I
<br>
suppose trying to justify biblical atrocities would make me feel defensive
<br>
(and quick to feel insulted):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I do see the world differently than you.  Listening to you blast off,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you most definitely do believe in a God, and you just appointed yourself.
</em><br>
<p>No, not me.  Metaphorically speaking (of course), nobody blasts off better,
<br>
and the Bible tells me so:
