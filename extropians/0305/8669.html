<em>&gt; I would like to see more emphasis on the psychological,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I've run into many, many people with the same sort of prop.  Of course,
<br>
there are many others.
<br>
<p>I think in order to use &quot;prop&quot; correctly, too, one must be able to
<br>
disagnose some sort of personality pathology -- i.e., that the prop is
<br>
actually harmful.  E.g., one wouldn't, I hope, call something a prop
<br>
that is psychologically healthy -- whatever is meant by the latter term.
<br>
If so, then anything which supports self-esteem becomes a prop --
<br>
reducing all of this to relativism and, further, allowing those with the
<br>
defective supports to continue on their way without fear of criticism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Picture Joe Sixpack though, working in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factory somewhere, and he has to call his boss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'sir'. On TV he sees reporters asking the president
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions, and the reporters are far from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deferential. Sometimes (though not much of late)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they seem downright hostile.
</em><br>
<p>I can understand the import, but I actually prefer the hostility to the
<br>
deferential attitude.  I wish the Press were like that all the time --
<br>
rather than when it has ideological motivations.  Instead, those in the
<br>
Press are -- surprised? -- human too.
<br>
<p>I also understand the rest of your comments.  The fact that people don't
<br>
learn to think of each other as, at least, subjectively rational --
<br>
i.e., rational within the context of their beliefs and attitudes -- is a
<br>
problem.  But unlike Huemer, I see this as not a fatal problem.  As I've
<br>
mentioned in other contexts, only a small %age of people or maybe
<br>
everyone a small %age of the time needs to be rational for things to
<br>
work out.  How many people were enlightened during the Enlightenment?
<br>
Only a small fraction, but enough to change the whole world.
<br>
<p>Another comment.  The more immediately irrationality has a negative
<br>
impact on success, the more quickly it's rooted out.  When you're on a
<br>
desert island, so to speak, you can't afford to be very irrational.
<br>
There's no one there to catch you when you fall.  When you live in an
<br>
advanced society, there are all sorts of irrational things people can
<br>
get away without causing to much trouble to themselves.  In essence, to
<br>
a large extent, this is both the blessing and curse of our advances:
<br>
they allow us to do stupid things and survive.  (Yes, there are points
<br>
when such advances allow the stupidity to be magnified too and cause
<br>
more havoc than it would have in a less advanced state.  But the balance
<br>
seems to be a system that can tolerate much more stupidity.  The problem
<br>
is to insure that stupidity is not allowed to affect critical aspects of
<br>
society -- or, when it does, that counterveiling forces are in place to
<br>
limit or undo the damage.  To this end, we have taken over key processes
<br>
in society and will continue to work behind the scenes...  Oops!
<br>
Perhaps I'm saying too much.:)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
