On Sat, 31 May 2003, Harvey Newstrom, commenting on Brett's
<br>
comments I believe derived from a Time Magazine article wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That main quote that &quot;learning itself consists of nothing more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switching genes on and off....&quot;  To claim that memorized information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switches one's genes off and on is misleading.
</em><br>
<p>It depends how they mean it.  I think Anders would agree that
<br>
&quot;memorized information&quot; is contained in neuron patterns that
<br>
primarily involve synaptic structures composed primarily of
<br>
proteins and lipids.  But to *grow* those structures
<br>
probably requires turning genes on or off.  Perhaps one
<br>
can get away in short term learning with protein-protein
<br>
interactions that alter the pattern of neuron transmission
<br>
(based on electrical firing patterns) but for long term
<br>
changes I think you are going to have to change the
<br>
patterns of neural interconnects and that is going to
<br>
require changes in gene expression.
<br>
<p>So I don't think the statement is misleading.  It may be
<br>
poorly worded.  But unless the author understands both
<br>
molecular biology and neurophysiology I doubt it is easy
<br>
to get this really well worded.
<br>
<p>This gets back to my &quot;regulome&quot; comments.  Understanding how
<br>
neurons really work will probably require understanding the
<br>
gene regulation in neurons, and perhaps supporting cells, on
<br>
multiple time frames, e.g. minutes, hours, days, years.
<br>
My impression is also that different parts of the brain may
<br>
be handling things differently (at least in terms of hormone
<br>
and neurotransmitter significance) so we may need to wrestle
<br>
with time scales and gene expression changes in multiple
<br>
brain regions.
<br>
<p>But with increasing availability of gene expression chips
<br>
(Affymetrix, etc.) this shouldn't be too difficult.
<br>
<p>Robert
