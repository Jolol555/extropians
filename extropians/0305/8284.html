Terrorism is no respecter of nationalities. At least two Finnish families
<br>
were also killed in the terrorist attack, ostensibly committed by al-Qaida,
<br>
in Saudi Arabia earlier this week. Thought you might be interested in the
<br>
local press reaction. This is a free, abridged translation (therefore not in
<br>
infringement of copyright) of the lead editorial in yesterday's &quot;Turun
<br>
Sanomat&quot; (Finland's third largest independent newspaper):
<br>
___________
<br>
<p>U.S. President George W Bush has regarded the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's
<br>
regime in Iraq as a great step in the battle against terror. Now when
<br>
terrorists once again succeeded in surprising the Americans -- this time in
<br>
Saudi Arabia -- the question inevitably arises as to whether the latter are
<br>
off-course in their war against terrorism -- since hotly pursued weapons of
<br>
mass destruction have not been uncovered to any greater extent than true
<br>
evidence of contacts with the al-Qaida network.
<br>
<p>The devastating events in Riyadh during the night between Monday and Tuesday
<br>
appear to be the work of al-Qaida. They are reminiscent of the bomb attacks
<br>
a few years ago in Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
<br>
has indicated the same.
<br>
<p>The suicidal onslaught which occurred on the very threshold of Powell's
<br>
visit to the country acted as a ponderous fresh blow to the work of U.S.
<br>
intelligence personnel. American intelligence confirmed that &quot;something&quot; was
<br>
being planned against U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia. A warning of
<br>
this was made at the beginning of May. Regardless of this, it was not
<br>
possible to guard against the actual attacks. The trucks, filled with
<br>
explosives, obtained surprisingly easy access to the foreign quarter.
<br>
<p>The bomb offensive in Riyadh in fact showed, in an appalling manner, that
<br>
the real means to stop terror have not been found. Terrorists are still
<br>
quite capable of taking action and striking as they wish with deadly force.
<br>
<p>With the increase in anti-Americanism in Saudi Arabia, the United States has
<br>
begun transferring its troops out of the country. Almost 5000 soldiers are
<br>
due to be removed by the end of the summer.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, tens of thousands of Americans and other foreigners will
<br>
remain in Saudi Arabia after the departure of military personnel. These live
<br>
in isolated residential neighborhoods in the western style -- which cannot
<br>
fail but irritate Saudi fundamentalists who observe a strict rendering of
<br>
Islam.
<br>
<p>Bush has the same problem before him as Russian president Vladimir Putin has
<br>
in Chechnya: the fact is that raw military power does not appear to vanquish
<br>
terrorism. Both leaders would have good reason to consider much more deeply
<br>
the reasons behind the growth of terrorism.

<p>--------------------
<br>
<p>from reports i've seen, the problem wasn't lack of effort on the part of the
<br>
united states.  the saudi government appears to have denied there being any
<br>
threat and dragged its feet in investigating potential terrorism. 
<br>
<p>at the same time it looks like al qaeda sympathizers inside the governement
<br>
may have been actively aiding the terrorists.
<br>
<p>in this instance, i'd say that the terrorism is a direct attack on the saudi
<br>
economy.  saudi arabia is dependent on foreign workers, particularly to run
<br>
the oil industry infrastructure.  if all the foreigners are scared off, the
<br>
oil shuts down.  if the oil shuts down, the goverment loses its source of
<br>
revenue and could  fall.  if we're lucky, this strategy will backfire like
<br>
it did in egypt.
