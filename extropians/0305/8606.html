<p>Yes.  My main concern and, in fact, dislike of the libertarian agenda is 
<br>
not how smart it is but how practical it is.  Sure most well read people 
<br>
arrive at a libertarian awakening but there is an element missing that has 
<br>
kept me at a distance.  That element is bitter sweet - smart people lacking 
<br>
in social interaction.  I'd like to see a more compassionate libertarian 
<br>
interface that wasn't so Randian in nature. Inasmuch, it seems to me that a 
<br>
future oriented political agenda would pertain to the current issues - even 
<br>
the ones we like to ignore because they are beneath us - rather than so 
<br>
dramatic a belief about how things ought to be.  It isn't productive or 
<br>
promising to be staunch in any one 20th Century political sphere.  A more 
<br>
apt agenda would be one that is workable and global.  This is why I tend to 
<br>
imprint on catalytic schemas such as the ones produced by Bucky Fuller. I'd 
<br>
like to know of someone who is thinking more futuristically when discussing 
<br>
political models.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Anders' model is better because by separating out the attitude to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology and science it enables you to locate some groups who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; otherwise pose problems such as fascists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Real political views are far more complex than can be expressed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a few dimensions; we are essentially projecting down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;high-dimensional space (that might even have a weird metric) into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2D or 3D. Different projections reveal different properties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make them separable, a good projection shows the most salient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences clearly (similar to a principal component
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decomposition).
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Natasha:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's David Nolan's &quot;Worlds Smallest Political Quiz&quot; (1969).  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't work well because its 10 questions require quantifying by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people who take the test.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, I saw that the original quiz contained issues that have since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then changed party valence, like abortion and gun control. And even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then, judging attitudes is always messy. I think the benefit of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quiz is that it shows the difference between different approaches,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that is often a good wake up call for people.
</em><br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; At ExI, we are working on a &quot;Worlds Smallest Futurist Quiz, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm working on a version for my talk at the TransVision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Conference.  For this, I was planning on solicitating Ander's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; keen mind :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would be delighted! After all, there are different kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;futures and futurists too. However, that sounds somewhat different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the inherently political quiz I suggested in this thread.
</em><br>
<p>Great.  The &quot;somewhat different&quot; is true but not irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I'm not sure just how to does this for a futurists' quiz, but at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;least I've got the first 2 questions.  The night before last, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;mother, Max and I tossed around a few ideas and this was provoking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because of the differences between an 85 year old and baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;boomers.  We focused on biotechnological questions and my mother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;proved to be extropic in her thinking here.  But not everywhere!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I think that to design a balanced quiz, it would require either a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;person who is very sharp or a team of people from diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;backgrounds to test the questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think we need to think about what the quiz should reveal or be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used for. One approach is to show the assumptions about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speed/size of future changes and one's valence to it (e.g. Bill Joy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is close to our idea of the size and speed, but not that it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good thing, while many conservative thinkers are negative but do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not believe any real change is on the horizon). Another approach is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to look at how radical changes are conceivable within different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;areas, and how well these can be integrated into coherent world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;models of the future.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Today, I plan on working on a mock up.  I'll send it as soon as I 
<br>
have it written down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm just a beginner with this sort of thing, so I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enough experience to know right now. With a futurist quiz, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;design issue would be to help people rate their own ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;accept change and to adjust to change. Its pretty obvious that not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;everyone is futurist thinking in all areas. Politics and religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are probably the most backward areas for futurism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This seems like a third approach: to see how people react to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individually rather than how they perceive it. One could factor it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;along how much change people expect and how they expect to cope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with it, which would likely reveal the distinction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimists/pessimists and future-aimed and past-aimed people.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In many ways I think quizes are less revealing than the chart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself.
</em><br>
<p>Yes again.  I'll post my draft later this evening.
<br>
<p>BTY, I had planned to email you privately today, but discussing this openly 
<br>
is fine.  I look forward to a collaborative exchange.  Max is in the wing 
<br>
as well and I welcome anyone else who wants to help me out with this.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
