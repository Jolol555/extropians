<p>Moore is the third, or rather, in inpersonal terms, the Spike.

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it that about half the spam today is some prole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who stole a bunch of money in Nigeria and they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give it to me?  Has anyone ever actually fallen for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that silly gag?  Since the Nigerian got my name as someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is trustworthy, who is it that gave it to them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want to know who considers *me* trustworthy.
</em><br>
<p>I admit it. Since you let me sleep on your air mattress in your home
<br>
office at Extro5 without a) deflating the mattress on me, b) goofing on
<br>
my laptop, or c) fooding my inert corpse in the middle of the night, I
<br>
judged you to be trustworthy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the opposite of surreal?  Is it surphony?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps surfake?  Surimaginary?  Or just plain real?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surreal is kind of unreal, in a way, so the prefix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sur must mean negative or not or un.  So when someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes a joke that offends or falls flat, could we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that person is surfunny?
</em><br>
<p>Suryes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How did Palm Pilots get their name?  What has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand held computing device to do with guiding an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aircraft or ship?
</em><br>
<p>It pilots your life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The old movie The Birds caused us no end to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curiosity.  Many of us have not seen the movie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for many years, so our memories are dim, but perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone here can enlighten us.  Clearly Hitchcock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated sheer genius in making something truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frightening out of something as sur-scary as a flock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of birds with their beaks out of joint.  But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly was making these birds so crazy?  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they explained it in the movie and we just forgot.
</em><br>
<p>Unlike people, animals need no motivation to stay in character... or to
<br>
over act.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What made them chill out in that last scene when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the three (?) people get in a car and drive away?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In that scene where they find the guy dead in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; house, what exactly was the actual cause of death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did a bunch of birds actually peck him to death?  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that scene I do not recall seeing any bird corpses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the room.  Was it not a quite poor showing, downright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embarrassing, on the part of the hominid, considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he outweighed each of his opponents by a factor of at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least 20 to 1, not to mention the opposable thumbs?
</em><br>
<p>Ever been tied over an army ant mound??? Do you want to? I mean, ants
<br>
are puny little things, only 1/500,000 of a horsepower per. What can
<br>
they ever do to Mr Jones, engineer of scary secret weaponry?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there anyone here who does not think they could take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a flock of birds in hand to feather combat, assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the battle takes place indoors?  (Come on Beak-boy, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanna piece of me?)  Could not one surely slay at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few?  Why was no one in that town armed?  (Hey, Mr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feathers, meet Mr. Twelve Gage.)  
</em><br>
<p>As I recall, the movie was set in Massachusetts, so that would be an
<br>
accurate assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could not the NRA use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that as a good reason for every man, woman and child to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pack heat, as a precaution against crazed flocks of birds?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can never be too careful you know.
</em><br>
<p>As Uncle Jimbo (if you watch South Park) says, &quot;They're comin' for
<br>
me!!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it that when extropian/SL4/singularitarian/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist types gather, people bring *SO MUCH BEER*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then devour so very little of it?
</em><br>
<p>They were expecting me???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the helllll did people do before there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, sitting on the outhouse. Also shooting the bull around the wood
<br>
stove down at Dan &amp; Whit's General Store.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What did we do before there was an internet?
</em><br>
<p>I remember reading a lot more, and having a lot more of a social life,
<br>
(and a lot more girlfriends...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What did extropians do before there was google?  Did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we just go around, like, not knowing stuff?
</em><br>
<p>Before there was google, there was alta vista.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When we get wearable internet connections with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voice interface and fast google connections 24-7,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how are we going to explain to young people how we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever got along without that?
</em><br>
<p>Take it away from them for a week at a time. They'll get it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do they have crossword puzzles in French?  Do they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a bunch of American words in them?  Still?
</em><br>
<p>Oui, les crossworde puzzelles containement tres nomenclatures
<br>
Americains... Though I heard the french were holding their dictionaries
<br>
over the gutter, trying to dump out all those American words. It wasn't
<br>
working, it seems, so they are just more pissed. Last I heard this
<br>
afternoon, the French government wants to fund a 24 news channel to
<br>
broadcast the French perspective, not in France, but HERE... Of course,
<br>
it will have to be subsidised, since its Neilsen ratings are going to
<br>
suck so bad. Why don't they just call it &quot;Les PBS&quot;??? We'll even sell
<br>
it to them and get that anchor off of the taxpayers back. Hell, PBS
<br>
already broadcasts the French perspective so often they won't
<br>
transition that badly either. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it, exactly, that sushi is soooo good?  Its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing but a wad of rice and a slice of bait, yet we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheerfully drive way across town to get some.  Why?
</em><br>
<p>Cause there aren't any hooks in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many jokes are there that start with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variation of: An engineer, a mathematician and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a physicist go to a {fill in the blank}...  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard about 800 hundred of them, and we weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even slowing down when the party spontaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave out.  Why is it that the mathematician always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says something silly and disconnected from reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we know it?  Are there any of those jokes where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mathematician is the smart guy?  I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematicians.
</em><br>
<p>Mathematics has no reliance on or connection to reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Was I imagining it, or was there a spontaneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outbreak of niceness on the extropians list?  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I detected it three weeks ago last Tuesday, for several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours.
</em><br>
<p>After I did all my chicken jokes, I suddenly lost enthusiasm for
<br>
keeping up my end of the war and stopped playing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are there any foods that Homer Simpson does not like?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would he say as a prefix to that food?  Sur-mmmm?
</em><br>
<p>As I recall, there are, but I don't remember which ones. They are
<br>
certainly good for you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens if an autistic prisoner is sentenced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solitary confinement?  Would she know?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they'd probably enjoy it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much power could be saved if the light inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the refrigerator were not left on all the time?
</em><br>
<p>About twice as much as if your hallway night light sensed when it was
<br>
daytime and shut itself off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is it that there are so many extropians with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such enormous IQ numbers who cannot deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any mechanical device more complicated than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cerial box?
</em><br>
<p>They haven't been broke enough for it to matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Was Monte Hall intentionally screwing with people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds all those years?
</em><br>
<p>No, he was just screwing his hostesses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Ameridebt got some loser's monthly payment cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in half, why didn't he just call them again and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it cut in forth, then an eighth and so on until he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was debt free?
</em><br>
<p>Not a bad strategy. I think, though, that it requires a) that you stick
<br>
to a payment plan, and b) you can only apply for reorganizing once in
<br>
so many years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does *anyone* who hangs out on extropians or SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever read actual *fiction*, without the prefix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How did future fiction ever get the prefix sci to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start with?  Havent we always had science?  Did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inventors of the genre assume we would have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science in the future?
</em><br>
<p>Well, since science non-fiction already had a name, and Isaac Asimov
<br>
had a monopoly on that market at the time, the other supernerds, who
<br>
weren't nearly as original, had to come up with their own genre. Kinda
<br>
like how Arkansas was named after Kansas was: they were so dumb and
<br>
unoriginal that they said &quot;You're Kansas? Well, well, this'll be
<br>
Our-Kansas!!! So there!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do we call those oddball subcategories of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculative sci-fi like that show from the 60s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called Wild Wild West, where they had some weird
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futuristic technologies but was actually set in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past?  Is it still science fiction?  For that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, Star Wars is another good example.
</em><br>
<p>It is alternative history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How did the diet thread get so huge?
</em><br>
<p>Talking consumes calories (as does typing). It also makes you hungry...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we somehow accidentally discovered a seventh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quark flavor, wont the physicists be majorly screwed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up?  Would they attempt a cover-up?  Would we call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it still-more-strange?
</em><br>
<p>Given the symmetry rule, it would be Just-as-strange and would be
<br>
discovered by physicists in the axis of just-as-evil.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cannot book publishers invent a kind of paper that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not get that old book smell when one's text
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books get old?  Would not it be a terrific business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity, to make replicas of old college textbooks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with new paper, so that one is not constantly reminded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one is way into one's geezerhood?
</em><br>
<p>Make the pages out of automobile pine trees.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Marilyn vos Savant were to get on drugs and lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her mental focus, would we have to rename her Marilyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vos Stupid?  Or would she become merely vos Normal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SurSavant?  Would anyone have guessed that a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could make a career out of simply understanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian Theorem?
</em><br>
<p>No, She'd be Marilyn idiot Savant, and would be seen chanting, &quot;I'm a
<br>
very, very good driver...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics, how can we be *absolutely sure* that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is one of them?
</em><br>
<p>If this weren't, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
<br>
<p>Man, it sounds like you guys really really really needed me. I had no
<br>
idea you were so lost without me, maybe I need to be made a Foresight
<br>
Fellow..... Reminds me of the time when the Bostropians were entirely
<br>
confused about what SKU stood for...
