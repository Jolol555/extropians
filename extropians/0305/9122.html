<em>&gt; punishment does not reduce crime.            crime.
</em><br>
<p>I can personally attest that, in practice, this is not how meta-rational 
<br>
Bayesian wannabes actually argue.
<br>
<p>On our way back from Extro 5, Nick Bostrom and I shared a taxicab to the 
<br>
airport.  We each contributed half the fare, but on counting the collected 
<br>
money prior to paying, it became clear that there was an extra $20 bill 
<br>
which one of us had put in by accident.  I didn't think it was me, and 
<br>
Nick Bostrom didn't think it was him.
<br>
<p>First, we paid the taxi driver and got out of cab and into the airport. 
<br>
Then we turned our minds to the matter of the $20 bill.  Both of us, after 
<br>
counting the money remaining in our wallets, noticed no obvious 
<br>
discrepancy.  And both of us found it implausible that the bill could have 
<br>
come from his own wallet.
<br>
<p>Now most people would have argued with each other, trying to demonstrate 
<br>
superior politeness and altruism, until one person agreed to accept the 
<br>
bill, and the other walked off slightly higher in tribal status.  Or 
<br>
perhaps, after some rounds of the exchange, both would have agreed to 
<br>
donate the $20 bill to charity.
<br>
<p>But Nick Bostrom and I each knew the other to be meta-rational, so the 
<br>
following exchange took place:
<br>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky:  &quot;What's your estimated probability that the $20 bill 
<br>
is yours?&quot;
<br>
Nick Bostrom:  &quot;Fifteen percent.&quot;
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky:  &quot;Mine is twenty percent.&quot;
<br>
(Calculator referred to.)
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky:  &quot;I'll keep the twenty.  Here's eight dollars and 
<br>
fifty-seven cents.&quot;
<br>
<p>And that's how it works.
<br>
