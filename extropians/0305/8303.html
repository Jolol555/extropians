<p>
Harvey composes a list of items for which &quot;Liberals want
<br>
more diversity and options available to everybody, while
<br>
Conservatives want to maintain the status quo&quot;, and
<br>
Damien rightly points out that item number 4, vouchers
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, vouchers could be seen as giving families more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice and options as to what schools to go to.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed, I only agree that about half of the list of
<br>
items can be seen as changing *away* from the status quo:
<br>
<p>1.  Abortion:  new option that gives freedom to women
<br>
<p>Yes, but since 1973, any new option would be to let
<br>
states individually determine their own laws, thus
<br>
moving freedom down one level from federal to state
<br>
(not that I'm against ultimately moving it all the
<br>
way down to individuals!)
<br>
<p>2.  Taxes:  new funding for new programs
<br>
<p>Conservatives are often plenty in favor of new programs,
<br>
so long as they boost the military, or, more ominously,
<br>
diminish social freedoms, such as drug laws, laws
<br>
against sodomy, etc.
<br>
<p>3.  Drugs:  new modes of consciousness and new thoughts
<br>
<p>Yes.  Liberals are indeed almost as much in favor of abolishing
<br>
laws against drug use as libertarians tend to be.
<br>
<p>4.  Vouchers:  a way to get kids away from new ideas (like sex education and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolution) and back into traditional-family-faith-based schools
<br>
<p>Damien refuted this.
<br>
<p>5.  Pornography:  new modes of sexuality besides the heterosexual missionary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position within a traditional family unit
<br>
<p>Yes.  Liberals favor freedom on this one too (in general, liberals
<br>
go for social freedoms, except for freedom of association, and the
<br>
freedom to discriminate).
<br>
<p>6.  Welfare:  new opportunities for poverty-stricken minorities, might change
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the balance of power
<br>
<p>The conservatives will say that they want to free people from
<br>
dependency on government handouts.  There is no little truth
<br>
to this: when I was 29, all it would have taken---if only the
<br>
government had known!---would have been a measly $15 per day,
<br>
peanuts! and I would have never gone back to school and into
<br>
computer programming, and would be a welfare recipient to this
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>7.  Environmental Laws:  new restrictions based on the idea that the environment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is being changed
<br>
<p>Hmm?  But liberals *like* the laws to prevent environmental change,
<br>
and so keep the status quo.  Conservatives are much more in favor
<br>
of economic development (i.e., change).
<br>
<p>8.  Military:  keep new immigrants out and new ideas out to keep America
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unchanged
<br>
<p>No ;-) liberals want other nations to remain as they are, and not
<br>
be forced to be civilized  by a petulant and irascible U.S.  Here,
<br>
it's the conservatives who are all for change!
<br>
<p>(Yes, it is ironic:  the conservatives want *them* to change, 
<br>
and the liberals want *us* to change!)
<br>
