law that means anything someone has to be able to convince ordinary voting

Americans that that is something *they* should care about. 
<br>
<p>Brett,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have gotten to the crux of the your misunderstanding.  The 
<br>
ordinary American in overwhelming numbers does care about international law.  
<br>
They have long been devoted to the love of international law.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that same American does not see his country receiving 
<br>
international law.  I think we see French and German conduct as avaricious 
<br>
not as lawful -- there are others involved but those are the leaders.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you state lofty European positions attempting to &quot;reason&quot; with us 
<br>
we do not hear you as reasonable.  We hear only a person that is doing one 
<br>
thing strictly for his advantage and trying to talk us into harming ourselves 
<br>
for his advantage.  As I said before, &quot;Phony baloney.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As before, I am sorry to be on the other side of this subject from 
<br>
you.  But I think it is long since time for Americans to take up the European 
<br>
policy of looking out for their own good, not that of others.  Believe me you 
<br>
do not want to use superior European morality to make your point with most 
<br>
Americans at this time -- that coin is made of lead and won't buy you the 
<br>
hole out of a donut.
<br>
Ron h.
