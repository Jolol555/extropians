I did some more checking on this subject of &quot;fraud.&quot; I'm sure Mike will
<br>
correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that Wayne LaPierre of the NRA has no
<br>
basis for accusing CNN of misrepresenting the case against so-called assault
<br>
weapons unless he can show that the CNN reporter John Zarrella used more
<br>
powerful ammunition in the banned semi-automatic assault weapons than he did
<br>
in the non-automatic weapons during his comparison of the two classes of
<br>
weapons in the original controversial broadcast. 
<br>
<p>It seems the only semi-reasonable arguments that gun control advocates can
<br>
make against so-called assault weapons is that successive rounds from these
<br>
banned guns can be fired more quickly and with less frequent re-loading. The
<br>
banned weapons do not necessarily use more lethal ammunition than legal
<br>
weapons, but on the other hand the larger magazines and rapid fire
<br>
capabilities of the banned semi-automatics certainly do make them better
<br>
suited for criminal purposes than non-automatic weapons. 
<br>
<p>It appears the ten year ban on these so-called assault weapons will expire
<br>
in '94. The White House has stated that Bush favors an extension of the ban,
<br>
but at this point it appears that neither Bush nor Congress are actually
<br>
going to push for an extension. This makes the NRA very upset given that the
<br>
GOP controls the White House and Congress and given that the NRA thinks it
<br>
controls the GOP. :) It's no wonder that Wayne LaPierre of the NRA was so
<br>
beside himself in the interview with Kyra Phillips of CNN. 
<br>
<p>Wayne LaPierre also charges that Zarrella of CNN &quot;implied&quot; that banned
<br>
semi-automatic weapons are the same as fully automatic machine guns (which
<br>
have been banned since 1934, and are not a matter of dispute) but it's
<br>
difficult to charge fraud based on a mere implication.
