</em><br>
<p>What do you mean, for example?  It has seemed to me that it
<br>
was a particularly *Russian* trait to rename things upon the
<br>
slightest change in political wind.  Volgograd and St. Petersburg
<br>
are only the examples of cities!  They rename roads and buildings
<br>
constantly, as if something in their minds cannot stand being 
<br>
reminded of what they consider evil.
<br>
<p>Of course, Americans are not free of the same impulses by any
<br>
means!  I think that there was a short stretch of freeway named
<br>
the &quot;Richard M. Nixon&quot; freeway in southern California, until the
<br>
Watergate fiasco occurred, and the freeway renamed.  Then, 
<br>
recently, the democrats almost held a convention in building
<br>
that---historical analysis revealed---had been named in honor
<br>
of someone with Klu Klux Klan associations!  (Hmm. I'm really
<br>
puzzled by this, because almost everything in West Virginia is
<br>
named after Senator Byrd, and he had KKK associations.)
<br>
<p>Also, perhaps there is something in *totalitarian* thinking---
<br>
as opposed to merely authoritarian rule---that demands that
<br>
all associations with the Opposition be expunged.  So if we
<br>
remove the Russian and the totalitarian components of any
<br>
socialist movement, does what remains have this tendency to,
<br>
as you write, &quot;relabel anything that becomes unsavory&quot;?
