</em><br>
<p>Movement between what points?  Yes, there seems to be a Great Leap Forward,
<br>
giving us art and music (old flutes) and better stone tools and presumably
<br>
language and counting.  So, we hit that point 50,000 years ago.  What's the
<br>
evidence of progress between then and the actual invention of writing, less
<br>
than 10,000 years ago?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when we settled into complex farming societies. I just wanted to make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear that this was only an escalation of a process that started long before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the advent of agriculture. We cannot thank agriculture for the ability to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math and write language. We can thank it only for adding more selection
</em><br>
<p>No one has claimed that agriculture should be thanked for that ability.
<br>
(Well, maybe Julian Jaynes.)  Obviously that ability was probably latent (or
<br>
not so latent, with basic counting-off arithmetic) 50,000 years ago.  But
<br>
I'd want to see evidence that that ability was being further developed, not an
<br>
assumption of gradualist progress being made.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; pressure to the development of these traits that were already under pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for development anyway. There is no reason to think we would not have made
</em><br>
<p>What pressure for development of writing or geometry?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We humans are, by nature, curious about the world. This trait of curiosity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is I think at the root of intellectual progress. Farming did not make us
</em><br>
<p>But that curiosity was limited by a lack of recording ability and by limited
<br>
venues of exploration, people being limited to their traditional grounds,
<br>
probably not crossing long distances to explore and bring back information.
<br>
<p>Remember there's a basic problem with hunter-gatherers and records: the H-Gs
<br>
are mobile, and can't carry a lot.
<br>
<p>As for all the extolling of the H-G life, let me bring up some neglected
<br>
points.  Not life expectancy, I think that's abused -- LE from birth with 50%
<br>
infant mortality isn't telling us anything about average age of adults, or the
<br>
LE of someone old enough to know what a LE is.  But as an H-G you lived in a
<br>
fairly small world.  There was often raiding of women or fighting for
<br>
bloodfeuds or fun, and the death rate from violence was really high.  Lose one
<br>
man from a band of 30 and you have a 3% casualty rate right there.  H-Gs knew
<br>
a lot about the plants and animals around them, and the seasons, and may have
<br>
been less superstitious and fearful than subsistence farmers[1][2].  But you
<br>
still have a lot of arbitrary taboos and beliefs which, not to put a fine
<br>
point on it, Were Not True.  And your life was pretty similar to that of your
<br>
grandparents.  Maybe a new tool would be developed, maybe a new food or poison
<br>
would be discovered or heard of through tribe-to-tribe trade, probably new
<br>
songs and stories would get written.  But what you knew was limited to what
<br>
you could learn by song and story and example from your elders, and what you
<br>
could pass on to your grandchildren had the same hard limits.  Well, plus some
<br>
cave art, but the information density wasn't too high there.  Perhaps someone
<br>
could have had a ritual library of clay tablets children could study at in the
<br>
right season... but we haven't found any.
<br>
<p>Yeah, agriculture sucked for a lot of people[3].  But if you believe progress
<br>
is at all desirable, it seems to have been necessary.  H-Gs had 40,000 years
<br>
to do something other than become cozily fitted to their local environments
<br>
and I know of no evidence that they did so[3].
<br>

<br>
<p>[1] _The Mbuti Pygmies_, on the pygmies vs. the surrounding farmers.
<br>
<p>[2] OTOH, Jane Jacobs argued that cities and agriculture would have grown
<br>
together, or even that 'cities' (trade concentrations, at least) came first
<br>
and invented agriculture &quot;the same way they invented everything else&quot;.  And
<br>
exported it to the countryside where land was cheap, as per the usual pattern.
<br>
In this view the benighted subsistence farmer is not the 'natural' state of
<br>
agriculture, it's what got left over after the city was sacked and the farmers
<br>
were deprived of their source of tools and trade.
<br>
<p>[3] Of course, as they slowly spread they did adapt to different environments,
<br>
and the aborigines must have had a really early use of the boat.
