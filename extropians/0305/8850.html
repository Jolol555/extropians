<p>Working Remotely, Robots in Place
<br>

<p>PALO ALTO, California -- How would you feel about sitting across a
<br>
conference table from a robot remotely controlled by a colleague who could
<br>
not make the meeting?
<br>
Fears of severe acute respiratory syndrome and terrorism, combined with
<br>
drastically reduced travel budgets, mean more companies are considering
<br>
video conferencing as an alternative to face-to-face meetings.
<br>
<p>But Hewlett-Packard scientists say the most natural way to &quot;meet&quot; when
<br>
people are not face to face is to use robots.
<br>
The scientists, who work out of HP's research laboratory in Palo Alto,
<br>
were recently on hand to prove it, showing off the prototype for a robot
<br>
that could navigate through the halls of a building, lower itself down to
<br>
eye level at a conference table and even mix and mingle with associates as
<br>
if it were a person.
<br>
Hewlett-Packard doesn't consider it a robot, but a &quot;surrogate,&quot; since it
<br>
would have the face and the voice of the person who remotely controls it.
<br>
&quot;It's not really a robot,&quot; said HP fellow Norm Jouppi. &quot;Robots decide what
<br>
they want to do by themselves. This is not a robot any more than your car
<br>
is a robot. You control it the same way you would your car, only
<br>
remotely.&quot;
<br>
While HP emphasized that the surrogate is a research project that will not
<br>
necessarily become an actual product, the researchers said they used
<br>
available technology to construct it.
<br>
The purple plastic surrogate, approximately 5 feet 8 inches tall, has a
<br>
wheeled base with circuitry and a power outlet. HP said a future design
<br>
would eliminate the wires and incorporate an 802.11a wireless chip and
<br>
sensors so the surrogate could move around without bumping into walls.
<br>
The machine is armless. Jouppi said an earlier prototype with arms could
<br>
press elevator buttons and even shoot a Nerf ball into a basketball net, but some people didn't like it.
<br>
The robot's &quot;head&quot; is a four-way computer monitor that displays images of
<br>
the head of the person remotely controlling the surrogate.
<br>
That person must sit in a small room with screens and projectors all
<br>
around, maneuvering the surrogate with a joystick. With microphones
<br>
surrounding the robot's head, the remote worker can listen to individual
<br>
conversations at the table and even turn to certain people to provide eye
<br>
contact and input.
<br>
The control room creates the meeting virtually for the person controlling
<br>
the robot.
