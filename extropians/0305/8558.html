<p>
There has been a large poll on &quot;what the French believe&quot;. I haven't
<br>
read the original results, but based on a commentary published in Le
<br>
Monde &lt;<a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/article/0,5987,3232--317031-VT,00.html">http://www.lemonde.fr/article/0,5987,3232--317031-VT,00.html</a>&gt;
<br>
on which I accidentally stumbled, a spectacular evolution is seen when
<br>
one compares the results of this year with the results from the
<br>
previous, same poll in 1994:
<br>
<p>Belief in the explanation of personality according to astrology has
<br>
gone from 60% to 37%.
<br>
Belief in foretellers has gone from 46% to 23%.
<br>
Belief in occult practices, enchantments, etc., from 41% to 21%.
<br>
<p>The loss of beliefs &quot;in the supernatural&quot; is strongest among the young people.
<br>
<p>People who define themselves as &quot;rationalists&quot; [rationalistes] go from
<br>
22% to 52%. (Among the young people: from 22% to 67%.)
<br>
<p>Still, most religious indicators are slightly on the rise:
<br>
<p>- &quot;belonging&quot; (I guess the person had to say if &quot;she was Christian/Muslim/Other&quot;):
<br>
from 61% to 64%;
<br>
- &quot;frequent prayer&quot;: 13% to 22%;
<br>
- &quot;monthly practice&quot;: 5% to 17%.
<br>
- &quot;believe in trinity&quot;: went down (not said how much in the article)
<br>
<p>The 18-24 y/o who defines themselves as &quot;believers&quot; go from 10% to 27%
<br>
(not said what proportion are muslims).
<br>
The 18-24 y/o who defines themselves as &quot;atheists&quot; go from 17% to 28%.
<br>
<p>Regarding the proposition &quot;The idea of sin doesn't mean much to me&quot;, the
<br>
proportion of people who DISAGREE with it goes from 39 to 57% (and 35
<br>
to 64% among the 18-24 y/o), which is interpreted by the guy
<br>
(sociologist) as &quot;a certain comeback of morals, in particular among
<br>
the young people: one gives value again to authority, fidelity in the
<br>
couple, public order. While asking more freedom in the private sphere,
<br>
seen as the field of personal responsability.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't think they asked how many expect the Singularity and when and
<br>
if they are scared or not. Maybe in the next poll.
<br>
