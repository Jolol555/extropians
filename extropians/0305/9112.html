<p>
I had always sensed that reading Hayek could be rough
<br>
going, but I now finally have irrefutable proof.  The
<br>
following sentence appears on page 10 of &quot;The Road to
<br>
Serfdom&quot;:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superficial and misleading view which sees in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Socialism merely a reaction fomented by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those whose privileges or interest were threatened
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the advance of socialism was naturally supported
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by all those who, although they were at one time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active in the movement of ideas that has led to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Socialism, have stopped at some point of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that development and, by the conflict into which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this brought them with the Nazis, were forced to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave their country.
<br>
<p>What!?  Now yes, I was television baby, and so many of the
<br>
19th century type sentences uttered by writers of the latter
<br>
century don't stick will enough in my short term memory to
<br>
enable me to follow them very well.  And indeed, Hayek
<br>
was born in that now long-ago century.  But here is a
<br>
20th century translation that I have achieved, by dropping
<br>
certain phrases, and converting them into self-standing
<br>
sentences:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a superficial and misleading view that sees
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Nazism merely a reaction by those whose privileges
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or interests were threatened by socialism.  This view
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was naturally supported by people from a certain class,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;namely, the class of those individuals who had at one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time themselves been National Socialists (in the early
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days of that movement).  They however had to abandon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their adherence to National Socialism when [other of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their beliefs or traits?] brought them into conflict
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Nazis.  Ultimately, many of these were forced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to leave their country [Germany, and come here, Britain].
<br>
<p>Whew!  I hope that I do not encounter more than one such 
<br>
sentence per page in the remainder of the book!
<br>
