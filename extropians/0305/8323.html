Michael Wiik writes about the creative process
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me it's all design. And when I design, first I build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up, then I take away. I design a bit beyond the requirements,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I can see where I can add value within the budget. I keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of constraints, but experience teaches what issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be bypassed in this phase.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then I begin to trim away redundancies, and extraneous material. When 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is nothing else to take away, then I'm done. But the idea must be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed time and space to grow. If I begin to take away too early, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I limit my possibilities.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, at each stage in the creative, and even problem-solving phase,
<br>
I'm undergoing conjecture and refutation over and over and over.
<br>
&quot;Hmm, that could be it. No, wait.  Maybe this.  Hmm, no, that can't
<br>
be right...&quot; and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I trust my background thinking, and unless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's some sort of dire emergency, avoid designing and implementing on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same day. I 'sleep on it', and before I sleep, try to think how it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be different or if I've failed to see some error. Sometimes just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the build-up can take weeks.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this &quot;trying to see an error&quot; is subjecting your thoughts
<br>
to (self) criticism, as you conjecture here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you develop your own ideas? Do you alternate mental sentences of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity with criticism? Do you find yourself constantly shooting down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own thoughts, before they're allowed to take flight? If not, why do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have the need to do so to others?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Shooting down thoughts before they're allowed to take flight...&quot;,
<br>
---an interesting revelation.  As for me, the good ideas take off
<br>
despite any headwind.  Yes, some of it is &quot;what if we *could*
<br>
do xyz...&quot;.   As to &quot;why do it to others&quot;?  Why not?  People with
<br>
ideas are usually pretty head-strong in the sense of not being
<br>
easily dissuaded from them.  All too often, on this list, it is
<br>
widely proclaimed that *this* is the problem:  folks are too
<br>
stubborn in maintaining their position even after &quot;contrary&quot;
<br>
facts and criticisms have been generated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Take a another look at your post. Is there any constructive criticism? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you suggest any improvements or alternates? Or do you immediately and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply reject the notion we can become more productive if we structure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our discourse a bit. Does your post do anything to extend the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation, or does it just attempt to end it?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry that you perceive me (or anyone) as having attained
<br>
such powers as to be able to single-handedly end conversations.
<br>
I think that that is ridiculous.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My post had been up there for a good day. No one had responded. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic was dead as far as I was concerned.
</em><br>
<p>And so you are complaining!?  Gee, I noticed that, and had
<br>
the temerity to suppose that I was doing you a favor.  To
<br>
me, to be ignored completely is worse than someone at least
<br>
taking the time to attempt to refute what I am saying.  I
<br>
always consider myself fortunate and lucky whenever someone
<br>
has the time to attend to anything I say---when it is so
<br>
absurdly easy (unlike at a party) to just pass over something
<br>
in silence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your post had no value whatsoever, except to demonstrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to yourself your alleged 'PCR' skills and stroke your own ego.
</em><br>
<p>Good old Mike---unwilling to take further time to attack the
<br>
ideas, you just attack the person instead, and lapse into
<br>
speculation concerning the base motives of the person who
<br>
disagrees.  But you will note that there was a more positive
<br>
reply after your reply to me; thus I have saved your ideas
<br>
from the graveyard after all.  Some gratitude you show.  ;-)
<br>
<p>Lee
