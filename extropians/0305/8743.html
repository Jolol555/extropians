It's
<br>

</em><br>
<p>I know, it's hard but we manage somehow. (I was thinking about &quot;1066 And All
<br>
That&quot; actually).

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, BC is before Christ, so you can't have a zero year before he's born.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AD is year of the lord, so that starts with 1. My question is how to
</em><br>
handle
<br>
<em>&gt; the final 9 months of the BC year prior to the onset of AD, since he's
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing miracles and preaching and other god stuff. Strictly speaking, 1 BC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only had three months, and 1 AD 21 months.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Seriously, there are &quot;infancy narratives&quot; for JC and other saviours that
<br>
work exactly that way, with miracles performed before birth and learned
<br>
arguments about it. YCMIU. For the calendar the problem is that for normal
<br>
types such as us you only reach age 1 after a year so while you are 1 you're
<br>
actually in your second year. The calendar (and JC presumably) is 1 at the
<br>
starting point. This all comes from letting a monk up in Tyneside sort out
<br>
the calendar - you can't trust these Geordies to do anything!
