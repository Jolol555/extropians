<p><em>&gt; A friend [says]:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ===
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My theory was that the media, if it's doing a good job, reports many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different things and viewpoints - and many different viewpoints ends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up being, by strict definition, liberal.
</em><br>
<p>So much for trying to keep our terms straight  8^D
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can only say that I listen to NPR, and often hear conservative things I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't like, but it's accused of being &quot;liberal&quot;. And I do hear &quot;liberal&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things I do like, too. Being a liberal, I accept that the media should cover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both. ;)
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that this is even attempting to distinguish factual
<br>
reporting from op-ed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe you could run the argument more along the lines of: there are left-wing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and right-wing and any number of narrow-viewpoint sources. But a truly good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source will report a lot of things you don't agree with.
</em><br>
<p>I would vastly prefer that each media outlet through context
<br>
make it perfectly clear when it's attempting (however poorly
<br>
or well) to objectively report the facts, and when it is
<br>
offering up its own partisan explanations of events.  While
<br>
I deem the latter just as valuable as the former, a clear
<br>
line needs always to be drawn between them.
<br>
<p>When attempting to portray what's happening, reporters and
<br>
media presentations should be in objective mode, mode A. 
<br>
That is, it should be impossible for all but perhaps the
<br>
very most skilled listeners to discern even a trace of bias.
<br>
<p>Then, when an analyst, or talk show host, or reporter goes
<br>
beyond that---as someone like Rush Limbaugh is perpetually
<br>
doing---and offers *explanations* of events from a certain
<br>
perspective (call this mode B), it should not be concealed
<br>
that this is what he is doing.
<br>
<p>Instead, though, it is quite customary for any number of
<br>
reporters from Peter Jennings through Walter Cronkite to
<br>
pretend to be in mode A while actually coloring the news.
<br>
Choice of vocabulary, news selection, facial expressions
<br>
and tones of voice convey an ideological partisan bias
<br>
in what is ostensibly honest reporting.  It makes me
<br>
sick, it being somewhere between lying and propaganda.
<br>
<p>I have no objection in principle to Bill Press or Bill O'Reilly
<br>
explaining the world from their perspective.  Depending on who
<br>
you agree with, the extra rumination from an ideological point
<br>
of view can be quite informative.
<br>
<p>But the clear distinction always NEEDS to be made!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Conservatives don't like different things, liberals do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- by definition. So a good media is going to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal media.
</em><br>
<p>Above, I thought that this was simply a bad joke.  But it
<br>
appears that the writer is serious.  Of all the hare-brained
<br>
ways to characterize liberals and conservatives, this takes
<br>
the cake.
<br>
