Rafal Smigrodzki responded to Eliezer S. Yudkowsky re my paper:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Certainly a quite complex article. I think that what you quoted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; above means that the Bayesian would treat the output of another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Bayesian as data of the same validity as the output of his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; reasoning. ... In effect, his beliefs are as valid an input for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; your future reasoning as your own sensory ... subsystem outputs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bear in mind that one should distinguish between *real*, *genuine*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bayesians like AIXI, and mere Bayesian wannabes like every physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; realized being in our Universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bear in mind also that the above result holds only if you believe with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absolute certainty (itself a very non-Bayesian thing) that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bayesian's reasoning processes are perfect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;### But why? If I believe with some reasonable certainty that the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesian is a perfect as myself, and then some more (to account for my lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of absolute certainty that he is what I think he is), then I should still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assign the same level of trustworthiness to his beliefs as to mine.
</em><br>
<p>Let me echo Rafal; you should find their reasoning as useful as your own
<br>
as long as they are as reliable as you.  They need not be perfect.

<em>&gt;To me the problem is simple in concept, but limited in practice. We can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never have absolute agreement between any two entities, due to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different knowledge bases (experiences.) However, two rational beings can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approach agreement as precisely as desired by analyzing and refining their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences. ... extrapolate any more limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concept of rational behavior to a timeless setting.
</em><br>
<p>The argument is *not* that eventually rational agents must come to agree
<br>
if they share enough experience and evidence.  It is that they must agree
<br>
*immediately*, merely due to knowing each other's opinion, without knowing
<br>
their supporting evidence.
