<em>&gt;&gt; This raises the question: how does one get started in
</em><br>
network/computer 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; security work?
</em><br>
<p>A BS in Computer Science or electrical engineering will take you much
<br>
farther but is not necessary to break into the field.
<br>
<p>Most of the people I know got their Cisco Network certifications first
<br>
through community colleges or
<br>
Computer based training and then landed their first job.
<br>
<p>From their they got their employers to pay for the seminars to pass
<br>
CISSP certification.
<br>
<p>Another trick is to request vendor evaluation for the hottest network
<br>
monitoring software and security products once you're in a company and
<br>
then add those to you're resume as well.
<br>
<p>I hear the government is also recruiting hacker types to go through
<br>
additional government computer security training.  Of course it help if
<br>
you've still got a clean record and your skeletons are well hidden
<br>
enough so that you can still get clearance.
<br>
<p>Most higher pay government, consulting, and private induastry still
<br>
require a BS degree.
<br>
<p>Software testing is unfortunately often considered easier than
<br>
development and therefore typically pays far less.  The better jobs come
<br>
from those experienced with automated testing tools such as Mercury
<br>
Interactive, et al.  
<br>
<p>Hope this helps!

Subject: Re: [Off topic] Looking for work
<br>
<p><p><p>Thanks for posting this resource, Harvey.
<br>
<p>This raises the question: how does one get started in network/computer 
<br>
security work? I consider it a short hop from some of the kinds of
<br>
testing 
<br>
I've done, which includes lookung for buffer vulnerabilities, etc. But I
<br>
<p>probably could use some mentoring, and who would be willing to do that?
<br>
<p>I mean, I hear (for instance) that Counterpane does some of its own 
<br>
training, but I wonder what their minimum expectations are.
<br>
<p>[MMB ducks behind a blast shield after mentioning a competitor to H. N.]
<br>
<p>[Muffled voice from behind shield:] And the confluence of the two
<br>
(security 
<br>
and SW test) seems to me to be a growth industry as &quot;matter becomes 
<br>
software&quot;, to whatever degree and at whatever rate it does...
