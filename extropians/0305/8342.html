that they appreciate your vote and your canvassing work, there's suggestions 
<br>
they couldn't care less about your 'influence' on their 'policy'. Consider:
<br>
<p>Mike,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could you ever be wrong?  Let me count the ways.  I have a Masters 
<br>
Degree from the University of Chicago but I have never heard of Leo Strauss.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a conservative, I am a radical.  I don't want to stand still 
<br>
or move backwards, my ambition is to move our country ahead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love listening to Rush Limbaugh.  He was raised only thirty or forty 
<br>
miles from where I was.  I don't listen to him because I agree with him, I 
<br>
don't agree, but because he is a better speaker than his opposition on the 
<br>
dial.  Rush is a true conservative although a nice guy personally, I am a 
<br>
radical, do you understand now?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now don't you know that a guy (me) that reads Al Jazeera also reads 
<br>
plenty of the right wing stuff also.  Neo Conservative is a term they never 
<br>
use.  The people you discuss are people they don't even know.  Neo 
<br>
Conservative seems to be a straw man erected by various left wing groups for 
<br>
their own propaganda purposes -- nothing more.  The right wing never heard of 
<br>
it except from the babbling left.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also wrote, &quot;He [Leo Strauss] also argued that Platonic truth is 
<br>
too hard for people to bear, and that the classical appeal to &quot;virtue&quot; as the 
<br>
object of human endeavor is unattainable. Hence it has been necessary to tell 
<br>
lies to people about the nature of political reality. ***An elite recognizes 
<br>
the truth, however, and keeps it to itself. This gives it insight, and 
<br>
implicitly power that others do not possess. This obviously is an important 
<br>
element in Strauss's appeal to America's neoconservatives.***&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is straight out of the Marx-Lenin playbook.  I guess after 150 
<br>
years most people will have forgotten it and you can pass it off as something 
<br>
new.
