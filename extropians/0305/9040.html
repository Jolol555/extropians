</em><br>
<p>Well we have seen papers that nearby gamma ray bursts are
<br>
probably fairly harmful to life as we know it.  There was
<br>
also a report (this week I think) about the discovery of
<br>
some galaxy with a huge density of stars that are or will
<br>
become super-novas.  This is also probably not good place
<br>
for life.  So it seems likely that the Earth has not
<br>
been exposed to nearby GRB or significant quantities
<br>
of supernovas.
<br>
<p>But if the so-called &quot;chimney/hole) around us is only a
<br>
few million years old then it probably hasn't impacted
<br>
the general development of life here too much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Would large regions of ionized interstellar gas, affect the propagation or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detection of radio signals? If so, this would explain Fermi's paradox?
</em><br>
<p>Radio signal propagation interference would more properly be called
<br>
upon to resolve the &quot;SETI&quot; paradox -- i.e. &quot;Why haven't we heard
<br>
from them yet?&quot;  But that can easily be resolved by &quot;Because we
<br>
are too dumb to be bothered to communicate with.&quot;  The Fermi paradox
<br>
is more properly &quot;Why aren't they 'here' yet?&quot;.  The studies in the
<br>
article cited (below) might explain that.  Even though we might live in
<br>
a nice neighborhood ourselves we might live in a &quot;bad neighborhood&quot;
<br>
to get to.  Traveling at any significant fraction of the speed of light
<br>
means you have to deal with running into particles (be they ionized H,
<br>
neutral H, or any other atoms/molecules).  Its expensive to start a trip
<br>
at 0.1c then have to slow down to 0.01c then speed back up to 0.1c.
<br>
The &quot;walls&quot; of the local bubble may make it very expensive to get to
<br>
us in terms of the cost of matter (ablation of the particle shields)
<br>
and energy (having to slow down and speed back up).  So we might
<br>
effectively be &quot;shielded&quot; from colonization.
<br>
<p>A lot more work needs to be done on the various costs (matter and
<br>
energy) of interstellar travel and why and how people would do it.
