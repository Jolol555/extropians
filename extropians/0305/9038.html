<em>&gt;I agree that everything he has said here is true; I simply don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that evolution erred to make us this way.  But first of all,
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I think there's general agreement that evolution didn't &quot;err&quot;. It's not
<br>
hard to find a theory for why it selected for something other than pursuit
<br>
of the truth, e.g. <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf</a>, or the theory in
<br>
The Mating Mind which implies that many recently evolved features of the
<br>
human mind amount to advertising. You sound as if you think evolution's
<br>
&quot;goals&quot; are always praiseworthy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It must be held in mind that mixed evidence DOES NOT knock down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;belief!  Mixed evidence does not refute anything, and a conjecture
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;You are thinking as if there were only two possible opinions we could
<br>
hold about a theory - that it is reasonable, or that it has been conclusively
<br>
falsified. If you rephrase your argument in Bayesian terms (i.e. talk in
<br>
terms of evidence altering the probability we assign to a belief), you
<br>
should find that your criticism either attacks a straw man or amounts to a
<br>
rejection of Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem is central to this argument, and
<br>
if you are confused about whether you agree with Bayes theorem, you should
<br>
expect to be confused about the argument that Huemer and Robin make. (PCR
<br>
is sometimes phrased as if it rejects Bayes theorem, but I've never heard
<br>
an argument that suggests this is intentional).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      This is illustrated by the capital punishment study mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      above (section 5, d): subjects scrutinized the study whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      conclusion they disagreed with closely, seeking methodological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      flaws, but accepted at face value the study with whose conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      they agreed. Almost all studies have some sort of epistemological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      imperfections, so this technique almost always enables one to hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      the factual beliefs about society that one wants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, as the skeptics say, extraordinary claims demand extraordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence!  If someone presents me with what appears to be an airtight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument that people are not affected by incentives, and that (say)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;redistribution of income won't affect total production, then I'm going
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to apply much stronger filters to that argument than I would its simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;converse.  This too is only natural, isn't it?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;That is natural, but it isn't epistemically rational for it to result
<br>
in predictable disagreements. If that happens, then somewhere along the
<br>
line, such as when deciding what to believe about how people are affected
<br>
by incentives, someone adopted a belief for reasons other than an interest
<br>
in the truth.
