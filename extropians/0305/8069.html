<p>
Considering the numbers of deaths due to flu each
<br>
year, and knowing the main source of the problem -
<br>
huge numbers of pigs raised together with ducks in
<br>
mainland China, the amazing thing is that nothing has
<br>
been done about it to date.
<br>
<p>If any country sent in assassins to kill 36,000
<br>
Americans in a year (10X the 9/11 deaths), we would be
<br>
at war tomorrow.  Yet somehow the millions who die
<br>
worldwide due to Chinese irresponsibility are ignored.
<br>
&nbsp;Forget flu shots (or don't, really; I get mine every
<br>
year and almost died (or felt like it) one year that I
<br>
missed).  Go to the source.  China has had the
<br>
attitude culturally and governmentally for a few
<br>
thousand years that they can get away with murder,
<br>
literally, and they are usually proven correct.
<br>
<p>For dozens of centuries, China has used its enormous
<br>
military might to extort protection money from all its
<br>
neighbors, by whom it is universally hated.  These
<br>
days, according to many reports, its agents go to
<br>
countries like Indonesia (or the U.S. - a la Gore,
<br>
Lorel, etc, etc, etc.), offering sweetheart trade or
<br>
military supply deals to the political and business
<br>
leadership  - offers that they effectively &quot;can't
<br>
refuse.&quot;  Chinese companies undercut U.S. firms by
<br>
stealing all the intellectual property for the
<br>
machinery used to produce a product and then
<br>
scrupulously abiding by the law for the final sale to
<br>
the dealer or distributor, thus destroying much of the
<br>
incentive to innovate.
<br>
<p>They are past masters at the game of corrupting and
<br>
then looting.  When the piper has to be paid, when the
<br>
man on the street discovers that the reason he is out
<br>
of work and starving is that his country has been
<br>
looted, it is the small Chinese shopkeeper whose
<br>
business is burned, wife and daughter gang-raped,
<br>
etc., while the crooks from the highest circles of
<br>
power leave to spend their ill-gotten gains.
<br>
<p>Such a culture/nation cannot be expected to act
<br>
responsibly unless it is forced to.  The only real
<br>
solution to SARS and the flu is to impose a quarentine
<br>
on China, period.  Nothing goes in or out until the
<br>
Chinese can verify to U.N. inspectors that they are no
<br>
longer raising ducks and pigs together.
