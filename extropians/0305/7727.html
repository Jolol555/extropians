<p>
The 'Experiences with Atkins diet' thread seems to have been swamped by
<br>
the Paleo diet enthusiasts, who react very strongly to any criticism of
<br>
their chosen food groups. I thought it might be useful for an outsider
<br>
to layout all the problems I could think of, so they could try to refute
<br>
them all at once.
<br>
<p>Firstly, I should say that undoubtedly the Paleo diet is far superior to
<br>
the standard default western diet that is producing widespread
<br>
obesity, heart attacks, cancers, etc. So overall it is a good diet, but
<br>
it could be improved (as gts does, in fact, by adding selected modern 
<br>
items).
<br>
<p>The basic paleo diet says that in paleo times humans ate meats, insects,
<br>
vegetables, fruits, and nuts, and that is what we should eat nowadays.
<br>
Therefore they reject grains, beans, potatoes, dairy products and sugar
<br>
(on the assumption that these foods were not available in paleo times)
<br>
The basic paleo diet can thus be grouped with the many high-protein,
<br>
low-carbohydrate diets that are currently popular, like The Zone.
<br>
<p>There are many variants of the paleo diet. For example, the Raw paleo 
<br>
diet insists on only eating raw meat and uncooked vegetables (based on 
<br>
the belief that cavemen did not cook their food).
<br>
<p>And the Neanderthin diet is rich in fat and protein, recommending fatty
<br>
meats, but no grains, potatoes, or milk, - it’s an Atkins-style diet.
<br>
<p><p>Problems:
<br>
<p>The first point to make is that there was no single 'Paleolithic Diet'.
<br>
Just as desert Aborigines ate different foods to those who lived in
<br>
temperate coastal areas or in tropical rain forests, so too Paleolithic
<br>
diets varied considerably. The range of available foods varied not only
<br>
geographically (ie, from one part of the world to another) but also
<br>
seasonally. Unlike today, our early ancestors often had no choice but to
<br>
eat the food that was available in season.
<br>
<p>If primitives lived near water, they probably ate lots of fish instead
<br>
of meat. It is more likely they ate meat only when they were lucky
<br>
enough to catch it.
<br>
<p>gts likes skinless lean chicken breasts. Nothing wrong with that, except
<br>
that a caveman is more likely to have thrown it to the dogs. In hard
<br>
times, primitive people would eat the whole animal. In good times they
<br>
wanted the fattest animals in the herd.
<br>
<p>Hunter-gatherers were certainly very physically active - much more
<br>
active than modern man. Getting enough food to live on, by itself, took
<br>
plenty of exercise and it was a full-time job. Obesity must have been
<br>
very rare. It is bad logic to say that we can have the diet without the
<br>
full-time physical exercise. They go together.
<br>
<p>Most nutritionists say that avoiding all grains, especially whole
<br>
grains, as well as beans, is unwise. You shouldn't overeat refined
<br>
grains, but there is no reason to totally avoid all grains and beans.
<br>
<p>Similarly, avoiding all milk and dairy products is also unwise. Low-fat
<br>
and non-fat dairy products are healthy and nutritious. The paleo diet
<br>
claims that you can get all the calcium you need from vegetables, nuts,
<br>
and fish (eaten with bones). That is indeed possible, but most modern
<br>
Americans simply will not get enough calcium from non-dairy sources
<br>
(unless they also take a supplement).
<br>
<p>Even paleo enthusiasts recognise that this diet is not well-suited to
<br>
the needs of endurance athletes. Athletes need to fuel optimum
<br>
performance and recovery, so workouts can be repeated after a relatively
<br>
short time. Endurance athletes have a critical need to replenish
<br>
glycogen stores immediately after exercise. For this reason, the diet is
<br>
modified to permit sugar and starch, but only during and after exercise.
<br>
<p>Remember that farmers out-competed hunter-gatherers. Farming could feed 
<br>
a much larger population and support soldiers to go out and beat up the 
<br>
hunter-gatherer tribes. Similarly the paleo diet could not feed the 
<br>
world population today.
<br>
<p>Cavemen didn't have coffee, chocolate, alcohol or ice-cream - so you
<br>
need a bit of double-think to let yourself indulge occasionally!
<br>
<p>Very few hunter-gatherers, whatever they ate, suffered from &quot;diseases of
<br>
civilization&quot; such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. They
<br>
didn’t live long enough to develop them. Their diet never had to evolve 
<br>
to solve the problems of middle and old age. But almost certainly many
<br>
tribes suffered from deficiency diseases and starvation.
<br>
<p>And not all Western degenerative diseases come from our diet -- many
<br>
relate to lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, exposure to pollutants,
<br>
etc. The western sedentary lifestyle is the cause of many problems.
<br>
<p><p>So to sum up, there is not that much wrong with the paleo diet. Just 
<br>
that it ignores perfectly good food groups and forgets to insist that 
<br>
regular exercise is also required for good health.
