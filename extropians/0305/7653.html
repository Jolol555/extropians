<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, the U.N. has become quite corrupt.  Is it time for it to go?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might be preferably for the UN to go. It was only as strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the good faith of the permanent security council members. Whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was moral or not there is widespread perception that the Iraq war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was illegal.  The American government is widely feared and respected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not trusted.  In my opinion this distrust is now endemic in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed world as well. To rebuild the trust it may be necessary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let the US citizens (who elect the US government) see and come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the depth of unease that prevails amongst citizens of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed world.  
</em><br>
<p>That's one solution: Americans should be more aware of others *feelings*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my opinion the distrust is not anti-American. It is the distrust of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the disenfranchised and the disempowered.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a better solution would be to enfranchise the rest of the
<br>
world.  As the U.S. is the world's pre-eminent military power,
<br>
why shouldn't everyone have an equal say in what is done with it?
<br>
Can you think of a logical reason why someone living, say, south
<br>
of an imaginary line in the American west should not be able to
<br>
vote, while someone living just a little bit to the north of it
<br>
can vote?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is the same sort of sentiment that caused an earlier generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Americans to go to war to assert their rights not to be taxed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (governed) without being represented. 
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  Just because they don't happen to be living in North
<br>
America, why shouldn't a peasant in China or some extremely poor
<br>
person in sub-Saharan Africa have an equal say?
<br>
<p>So the solution may just be for the U.S. to take over the world.
<br>
Hold on: this is not as evil as it sounds; after all, the peasant
<br>
in China and the starving man in Africa would *not* have to pay
<br>
any taxes to support that military: they aren't rich enough, and
<br>
fall below the poverty line.  Not only that, but they'd be
<br>
entitled to their fair share of the pie, and a safety net
<br>
provided by the (taxed) richer regions, like the U.S., Australia,
<br>
and Europe.
<br>
<p>Then they wouldn't be either disenfranchised nor powerless,
<br>
and their *feelings* would be so assuaged.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I would have preferred President Bush to have revoked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Charter before invading Iraq. In the long term perhaps that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have harmed the US reputation less (the US government reputation).
</em><br>
<p>You have to understand that there are two kinds of reputation
<br>
involved here, Brett.  One is the highly ephemeral dismissal
<br>
of the United States that one is likely to hear at a European
<br>
cocktail party or academic gathering (&quot;barbarians&quot;, &quot;hmmpt&quot;,
<br>
&quot;insufferable&quot;), and the other is the real fear inspired in
<br>
the hearts of terrorists and others who think about taking
<br>
action against the West.
<br>
<p>You seem to be completely ignoring the latter.  If enough people
<br>
in the West were like you, then they'd elect a lot of leaders
<br>
who would actually cause the ruffians of the world to despise
<br>
the U.S. *more*.  There would be *more* terrorism, more whining,
<br>
more anger translated into action---not less!  And then all the
<br>
people like you would wring your hands even more, and moan &quot;Oh, 
<br>
why do they hate us?&quot;.  Well, they hate you because (a) you
<br>
have more than they do (b) you make them feel inferior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However, I think that the trouble with the U.S. leaving the U.N.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be that it would play right into the hands of America's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enemies. &quot;See! They're so out of control that they won't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; talk anymore!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the problem is worse than that now Lee.  It's not that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US government won't talk that I think people outside of the states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear, it is that they can't be trusted when they do.  It's that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US signature on a treaty may not be worth anything.
</em><br>
<p>How ironic that North Korea now wants a non-aggression pact with the U.S.
<br>
Explain that!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this perception is now widespread amongst many of the citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the developed countries of the West. I don't trust the US government 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the Australian government). I am sure many intelligent US citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't trust it either.
</em><br>
<p>What is important is whether you can trust the U.S. to come
<br>
down hard on malefactors like Saddam Hussein;  believe me,
<br>
when all is said and done, it's actions like that, not a lot
<br>
of words, that matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yet there comes a time when, whether it's trade negotiations or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human rights issues, Americans should indeed worry about what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of the world will do.  Allowing the French and Russians to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; set the standard for human rights, or allowing a lot of America-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; haters to weaken international trade is not in anyone's real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No one nation can set the standards to the satisfaction of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationals of a majority of other nations. This is not essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an American problem. It's a representation problem.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I proposed a solution for that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without the UN any single powerful country disenfranchises the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens of the other countries.  That is not a formula for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stability or dare I say &quot;extropy&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>If it's *stability* you are after, things are much more
<br>
stable now than ever before.  One country practically
<br>
never invades another anymore, and when a major country
<br>
such as the U.S. does, it's after years and years of
<br>
negotiation and indecisiveness.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. Several paragraphs in the above were completely ironical.
