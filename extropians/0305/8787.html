Robert J. Bradbury:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Did not use a makeup mirror to heat things up as a child.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe I was a bit more scientific and used a magnifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glass... :-)  Don't think my mother wore much makeup...
</em><br>
<p>The mirrors work much better than a magnifying glass
<br>
because they are larger in area.  Ma had one that was
<br>
30 cm across.  One could really collect a lot of heat
<br>
that way and if one cleverly figured out ways to trap
<br>
heat, one could actually melt some metals in this way.
<br>
It impressed me how much power is pouring down on this
<br>
planet, even tho it is so far out here away from the
<br>
sun.  If one forgets the magnitude, it is nearly a
<br>
horsepower per square yard.  From that, a better 
<br>
two digit figure to remember is about 1300 watts
<br>
per square meter.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Humans are apparently the first emergent sentience here in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this galaxy.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I think you are in Eliezer's camp with this comment spike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but I still remain less convinced.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;See my reasoning, esp. points 1-5 at the end of this msg.

<p><em>&gt;To make a strong assertion that our galaxy is &quot;dead&quot; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to make a number of other strong assertions...
</em><br>
<p>OK let me read your site and think it over.  I am finding
<br>
the following line of reasoning compelling: any sentience
<br>
would want to think more.  The ultimate limit of computability
<br>
would be reached as soon as *every* photon that is emitted 
<br>
for any reason is harnessed to flip one bit.  Then all that
<br>
bit flipping is used to figure out better and better ways
<br>
to create more and better information more efficiently: the 
<br>
AI wants to get smarter.  This line of reasoning is sounding
<br>
more inevitable the more I think about it.
<br>
<p>I can see a post-Spike (or post-Singularity) humanity getting
<br>
to the point of wanting to stop all the wastful photon
<br>
barfing within a few hundred years, and actually starting
<br>
in some meaningful way to deal with that waste within 5000.
