THE LIGHTHOUSE
<br>
WHEN A &quot;TAX CUT&quot; ISN'T ONE
<br>
from &quot;Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy...&quot; Vol. 5, Issue 21 May 27,
<br>
2003
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
It sounds like a bad joke told by an economically literate stand-up
<br>
comic: When is a &quot;tax cut&quot; not really a tax cut? When it isn't offset by
<br>
a reduction in government spending. In that case, it is more accurate to
<br>
call the &quot;tax cut&quot; a deferred tax increase. (That's why the joke's not
<br>
funny!)
<br>
<p>According to Alexander Tabarrok, research director of the Independent
<br>
Institute, this is precisely the case with President Bush's proposed
<br>
&quot;tax cut&quot;; it's really a tax shift, Tabarrok argues, to a future where
<br>
taxes already were expected to increase significantly to pay for growing
<br>
Social Security and Medicare liabilities.
<br>
<p>&quot;To grasp the difference between a tax cut and a tax shift, we must
<br>
first understand that what ultimately drives taxes is spending,&quot; writes
<br>
Tabarrok in an op-ed carried last week by United Press International.
<br>
<p>&quot;If spending increases, as it has under the current administration, then
<br>
sooner or later taxes must increase (or inflation, a type of tax, will
<br>
go up).... If spending isn't cut, then less taxes today means more taxes
<br>
tomorrow. Thus, the Bush tax cut plan is really a plan for future tax
<br>
increases....
<br>
<p>&quot;Conservatives used to argue that the public didn't want big government
<br>
but was fooled by deficit financing and other hidden taxes into thinking
<br>
that it costs less than it actually does. Today, conservatives seem to
<br>
believe that the public does want big government and that the only way
<br>
to curb government growth it is to fool the public with lower taxes
<br>
today so that the costs of government will be so high tomorrow that no
<br>
one will accept the offer. How cynical.
<br>
<p>&quot;Will deficits in fact force future administrations to cut spending?
<br>
It's possible but I am fearful. The combination of changing demographics
<br>
and current tax cuts is seeding out economy for a fiscal 'perfect
<br>
storm.' When the storm hits there will be a crisis, and as economist and
<br>
historian Robert Higgs has ably demonstrated in CRISIS AND LEVITHAN,
<br>
small government rarely does well in a crisis.&quot;
