<em>&gt; the distrust is not anti-American. It is the distrust of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You have to understand that many serious and sincere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans read statements like that and in fact as your entire set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of comments as being largely an attempt to sell America a big piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of phony baloney.
</em><br>
<p>I'm struggling a bit trying to conceptualise the big piece of phoney 
<br>
baloney :-) but I think I get your drift.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        You have to also understand that many serious and sincere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans saw a threat out of Sadaam and out of the Al Qaida.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do not intend to live under that threat.
</em><br>
<p>I understand that. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        I am truly sorry to find myself on the opposite side of this 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; so bad&quot; while you and others mouth a propaganda  campaign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against my country.
</em><br>
<p>I am not trying to &quot;mouth a propaganda campaign against&quot; your 
<br>
country Ron. But I do think you hit on a home truth that others
<br>
have hit on before as well. Ultimately if there is to be international
<br>
law that means anything someone has to be able to convince 
<br>
ordinary voting Americans that that is something *they* should care
<br>
about. They are empowered to hold their elected representatives
<br>
to whatever standard they set, the US government does not 
<br>
represent the rest of us. That is no sledge. For the most part the
<br>
US government does not even claim to represent the interests
<br>
of the rest of the planet. Nor is it obvious to me why they should
<br>
unless it is in the interests of their citizens. 
<br>
<p>If the UN is a defunct farce and an impediment to real international
<br>
law emerging then perhaps the sooner it is ditched the better.
<br>
