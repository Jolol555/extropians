Eliezer writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Listen, the whole idea behind the *entries* in the table is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are the payoffs of the players.  That's what the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *mean*, the utilities of the players.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the experiments *measure* is monetary amounts.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but that's just a practical limitation of the &quot;experiments&quot;.
<br>
The entire difficulty, as well as the profundity of PD and its
<br>
variants, arises from considering that the entries represent one's
<br>
actual utility.
<br>
<p>I am confident that with some thought, you may be able to represent
<br>
numerically the equivalent game so that the same considerations
<br>
obtain for you as for those of us who view the entries as utilities.
<br>
Perhaps Hal's experiment suffices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I say that you should Defect (and that is what the entries in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; table say too) whenever you know what your opponent is going to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you know he is going to Defect, then you Defect.  If you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that he is going to Cooperate, then you Defect.  It's right there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the table.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not if your opponent determined his behavior by running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an accurate simulation of what you would do if you knew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely what your opponent would do.  Think timeless.
</em><br>
<p>Let me get this straight.  I'm a player in a PD, and all I know
<br>
is that my opponent has determined what he will do by running a
<br>
simulation of me.  This still does not enable me to know what he
<br>
is going to do, does it?  Yes, *if* he's acting on what I would
<br>
do *if* I knew definitely what he would do---that's one thing---
<br>
but it's pretty far afield from the actual situation in which I
<br>
evidently (in your example) do *not* know what he is going to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The highly interesting case is if you don't know what he's going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to do AND his behavior is probably correlated with yours.  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would be afraid to Defect against a physical duplicate if he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a close (or near) duplicate.  After all, whatever thoughts I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are likely to course through his head as well.  But if it any entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whatsoever, including 1983 versions of myself, then the table says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Defect&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And knowing this, your past self will defect against you, since he knows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you know what his behavior will be.
</em><br>
<p>No, my past self in 1983 believed in superrationality.  He would be
<br>
dumbstruck if I returned in a time machine, and then defected.  I
<br>
know what he will do.  He will cooperate.  Now, if I visit 1998, 
<br>
I do *not* know what my past self will do.  It's probable that he
<br>
will cooperate, but far from certain:  he *might* anticipate that I
<br>
will reason through that I should cooperate (then he will defect).
<br>
Thus I *don't* know what he will do.  Therefore it is not necessarily
<br>
true that I should defect (although perhaps I will and should).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By your logic, in fact, you and your past self should play this way even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the *iterated* Prisoner's Dilemma.  After all, you know what his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision will be on every round.  Oddly enough, though, the past you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember is a string of defections.  How sad.
</em><br>
<p>How ridiculous.  The Iterated PD is a completely different story.
<br>
I tried and tried in 1988 to work out proper strategies for it, but
<br>
had to finally give up; (after all, it's not a zero sum game).  The
<br>
only Nash equilibrium is where one defects on each round, which,
<br>
as you go on to say here, is really stupid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile, the two cooperating Eliezers walk away, grinning, pockets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loaded with utility tokens.  So who's the rationalist now, wise guy?
</em><br>
<p>Quite so.  One must Cooperate until &quot;somewhere near the end&quot;.  But I
<br>
finally decided that I might as well Cooperate right up until the very
<br>
end.  I used a weird form of logic to reach this conclusion.  Here's 
<br>
how it went.  Suppose that I begin to think about defecting on the
<br>
(known) last round.  Then I can anticipate the enhanced payoff from
<br>
this action, and so must anticipate my opponent's identical analysis.
<br>
Then, it becomes reasonable to Defect on the second-to-last round,
<br>
and so on.  Thus, for me, the first step &quot;Suppose that I begin to
<br>
think...&quot; is the fatal one!  So in the iterated case---where there
<br>
is a great deal of utility to be gained---as you say, a lot of gold
<br>
coins, or 200 repetitions of the same game---I cooperate, probably
<br>
even unto the last round.
