<p><em>&gt; This right-left liberal- conservative thing has always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confused me, [yeah, sure] conservatives are supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in favor of Low taxes and preventing women from having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortions but what does one have to do with the other?
</em><br>
<p>That's the interesting question; there are answers, but you
<br>
may find them boring.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It’s the same with wanting rigid anti drug laws and school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vouchers too, I just don’t see why it has to be a package
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal. Liberals have a similar problem, if you want fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions on pornography you must be a liberal and want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more welfare too;
</em><br>
<p>You &quot;must&quot; be?  No, as you know, there is no causality here.
<br>
Nor is there even much logic.  What we have are intense
<br>
correlations that survive over multiple generations, even
<br>
hundreds of years.  It's a true &quot;Conflict of Visions&quot; (the
<br>
name of a book written by Thomas Sowell, one of the few
<br>
people who really attempts to address the phenomenon).
<br>
Have you read it?
<br>
<p>Very few people are actually interesting in trying to deeply
<br>
understand what is going on.  Most of them, like I think you
<br>
(judging from the tone of your writing), aren't really interested
<br>
in the phenomenon, and just complain like that to make a point.
<br>
<p>The usual translation of the point is, &quot;I am above such
<br>
mediocre limitations&quot;.
<br>
<p>Yes, sigh, it's true that many libertarians, and no small
<br>
number of independent thinkers do not fit very well into
<br>
the usual camps.
<br>
