<p>John, I think having General Gas threaten us with gas was sufficient proof.  
<br>
As to &quot;flawed U. S. intelligence&quot; I don't know anyone whose spouse doesn't 
<br>
contain an element of mystery.  We have never had perfect intelligence and we 
<br>
never will.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was about 80/20 for going to war but had I known what has came out 
<br>
since I would have been up to at least 95/05.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was looking at the von Mises daily blurb this morning and they 
<br>
expressed what reservations I do have very well.  Everyone is approaching the 
<br>
reconstruction of Iraq like they were at their keyboards playing Sim City.  I 
<br>
don't think that will work.  Get the electricity flowing, turn the oil wells 
<br>
on (I am told they rely on electricity) and let the Iraqis have their country 
<br>
back for better or worse.
<br>
