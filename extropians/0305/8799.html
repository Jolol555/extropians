Mike, I'll try to address some of this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm curious to see if anyone knows where to find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what kinds of preparations might do well with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually working in nanotech programming?
</em><br>
<p>Harvey's comments are right on in certain respects.
<br>
Genomes are programs and one needs a background that
<br>
includes both computer science as well as either
<br>
biochemistry or molecular biology.
<br>
<p>There isn't any concept of &quot;nanotech programming&quot;
<br>
per se at this time.  There is &quot;biotech programming&quot;
<br>
and one can consider development in the areas
<br>
both genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as well
<br>
as gene therapies to involve aspects of this.
<br>
<p>This is going to transition into &quot;whole genome
<br>
engineering&quot; (and whole genome programming) over
<br>
the next couple of yeas but I've been trying rather
<br>
unsuccessfully to push this forward over the last
<br>
couple of years so it seems that it will develop
<br>
slowly.
<br>
<p>Real &quot;nanotech programming&quot; will not develop until
<br>
we have real nanocomputers in real nanorobots and
<br>
that is probably 15+ years away.  Interestingly
<br>
(to me) there will be an emphasis on space efficiency
<br>
in nanocomputers within nanorobots so experience with
<br>
assembly language programming may well be useful.
<br>
As one will likely be able to program the hardware
<br>
at a molecular level it may be knowledge of things
<br>
like FPGA's (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) may
<br>
well be useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've been going back to school to get a degree in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer science (I was doing COBOL programming, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost that job, so I'm looking to broaden/update some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills),
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... you may want to read:
<br>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/21/164247&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=137">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/21/164247&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=137</a><br>
on the possible shortage of mainframe techies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I'd really like to work in nanotech or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biotech, so I've been trying to find any programs for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either, with no luck.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;buzzword&quot; that you need to know is &quot;bioinformatics&quot;.
<br>
There are courses one can now take in this.  They tend to
<br>
end up in the comp-sci or the molecular biology departments
<br>
of various universities.  One needs to understand both
<br>
the architectures of genomes as well as the tools currently
<br>
used to deal with them (BLAST, FASTA, etc).  It is not strictly
<br>
necessary to have either a comp-sci or a mol-bio degree
<br>
to work in these areas.  A seach of bioinformatics (tools)
<br>
using Google, or books at Amazon would probably give you
<br>
a number of sources -- one should choose sources carefully
<br>
because they can be slanted to the theoretical (comp-sci)
<br>
side or the practical (Mol-bio) side.
<br>
<p>The job prospects in these areas are relatively good because
<br>
we are going into a state of information overload with respect
<br>
to genomic information and so people qualified in these areas
<br>
should likely have good job prospects.
<br>
<p>Experience in bioinformatics (over the next 10-15 years)
<br>
may give one a partial background in preparation for
<br>
nanoinformatics (but may need to be balanced with
<br>
experience in programming &quot;small&quot; [assembler] as well
<br>
as programming the hardware [i.e. the structures of
<br>
the molecules]) as I suggest above.
<br>
