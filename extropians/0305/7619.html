<em>&gt;&gt; self-righteousness, and hostility, quite unbecoming of civilized

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hunting is a rather expensive hobby, actually, from what I have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; an economic loss in the recreational use of land.
</em><br>
<p>### Hunting is much cheaper than sterilization - from the taxpayer's point
<br>
of view, hunting has a negative price, that is, hunters are actually willing
<br>
to pay extra to be able to hunt. If there is a conflict between two
<br>
incompatible uses of land, the rational solution is to offer the uses for
<br>
auction, allowing either hunters or hikers to buy certain land use rights
<br>
for some period of time (of course, the superior solution is to sell
<br>
state-owned land outright, but this is a different story), so that the use
<br>
with the greatest economic and human value (as measured by auction income)
<br>
becomes dominant.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, whereas natural predators (not being heavily armed) pick off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak and inferior, trophy-hunting hunters pick off the largest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthiest specimens, a reverse culling that is obviously detrimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the herds.
</em><br>
<p>### What kind of evidence would you like to offer in support of this claim?
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sterilization, if offered by volunteer veterinarians, is extremely low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost. Sterilizing agents can even be introduced into food, which is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap and effective it has to be done very carefully to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminating a population altogether. It is also painless since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevents the problem (animals that will starve) rather than dealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it after-the-fact (shooting the said animals after they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been born).
</em><br>
<p>### Tell me more. How low cost is it? Is it cheaper than the negative price
<br>
of hunting? Will its proponents be willing to outbid (with their own money)
<br>
the hunters? Are you talking about hormonal methods? What is their impact on
<br>
the psychology of the deer?
<br>
<p>Also, death of a sterilized animal of old age, disease, or predation, is
<br>
still more shocking than having its brains shot out, even if starvation were
<br>
not a problem.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than I would feel the need to remunerate child molestors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depriving them of the ability to molest children.
</em><br>
<p>### Ah, here is the true belief at last. Hunting is evil. Hunters are evil.
<br>
They are scum, to be wiped off the earth if possible.
<br>
<p>You understand that this is the archetypal in-group vs. out-group trick that
<br>
manipulators of all kinds use to attack their enemies. You don't feel the
<br>
need to treat others like human beings (i.e. no need for Rawlsian
<br>
reciprocity, no moral symmetry, no empathy) once you manage to put them into
<br>
the same group as child molesters. No limits now, all year hunting season on
<br>
hunters.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What recreational
<br>
<em>&gt; hunters do, killing animals without needing to, is extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unethical and inhumane, and has no place in a civilized society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you obviously equate with a recreational hunting society. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestion that blowing bloody holes in wild animals can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pleasant experience&quot; makes my stomach turn. I am sure, though, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectively this is true. Mass murderers of humans also probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience their romps as &quot;pleasant experiences&quot;. If the hunter folks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just after excitement, let them risk their own lives in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woods, not take those of helpless others. If they want to practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targeting, let them choose some inanimate targets. Try paintballing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, hunt other hunters, I would be OK with that. Just get a life...
</em><br>
<p>### Now, not being a hunter and never having been one, I don't really know
<br>
if it is pleasant or not. However, this is irrelevant to my ethical
<br>
reasoning, and I come to support hunters because I see it as my ethical
<br>
duty.
<br>
<p>You see, the form of ethical reasoning that you are using, the ethics of
<br>
repugnance (&quot;makes my stomach turn&quot;), the type of thinking exhibited by Leon
<br>
Kass, and by Jeremy Rifkin, is a way of answering questions which has no
<br>
place in the civilized society. If unopposed, it promises bad outcomes to
<br>
all those against whom it is directed, even you, once you find yourself in
<br>
the &quot;repugners&quot; crosshairs.
<br>
<p>In the long term, very strict limits on our freedom to force our likes and
<br>
dislikes on others are indispensable for the civilized society. Giving free
<br>
rein to one's emotions cannot be accepted, and only a material analysis of
<br>
events may form the basis for value-independent decisions. Let me explain:
<br>
Blowing holes in animals does not cause significant suffering (compared to
<br>
their usual experiences), and this is a finding of fact. The corresponding
<br>
decision must be then value-independent, since no fundamental, universal
<br>
societal values are involved - no sentient death and no excessive suffering
<br>
is at stake. If a legal decision is to be value-independent, yet mindful of
<br>
the non-universal values embodied in the wishes of individual members of the
<br>
society, there are a few procedures shown to yield good results in these
<br>
circumstances. One of them is based on private property, and only
<br>
circumscribed in the case of animals by the need to limit suffering.
<br>
Therefore, trapping animals in devices which do not kill instantly may by
<br>
forbidden for universal moral reasons, but killing (nearly) painlessly may
<br>
not be forbidden. Those who wish to kill may do so on their property with
<br>
their own animals. Those who wish to save animals may offer financial
<br>
incentives to stop killing (and of course then they have to deal with the
<br>
suffering of animals their actions cause).
<br>
<p>In the long run, you too will be better off if you restrain your feeling of
<br>
repugnance, and allow morally symmetric interactions to take place without
<br>
the violence against hunters you advocate.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most deleterious effect on wildlife in the US, IMO, is urban
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sprawl and other human encroachments on wild areas. This is how we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose the big predators, which can lead to the overly big herds, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - disruption of traditional ecosystem balances. The problem is caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by humans, so humans should solve it - not by blaming animals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shooting them when they are &quot;in excess&quot; (humans getting to define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excess, conveniently enough), etc. If humans try to densely occupy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every square inch of this earth, the ecological consequences will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon us shortly enough, along with the massive aesthetic losses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### I do not see how a rational person could assign &quot;blame&quot; to animals, or
<br>
see their killing as punishment. Deer are shot not out of spite, but as a
<br>
pragmatic action, similar to spraying for mosquitoes, removing weeds, and
<br>
clearing stones from a road. Obviously, humans caused the ecological
<br>
imbalance, and hunting is the economically optimal way of solving the
<br>
problem. Only humans can define &quot;excess&quot; here - deer do not have the
<br>
sentient rights which would allow them to participate in such reasoning.
<br>
<p>If humans decide to halt population growth, consensually, and based on sound
<br>
ethical principles (not some green-ish sentimentalism), well have all the
<br>
beauty we need. And enough deer to shoot, too.
