<em>&gt; (Hal Finney &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Electronic%20voting">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see two problems here.  The lesser one is that no paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is left at the polling place.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yeah, that was kind of the idea. The definitive auditable
<br>
result is supposed to be the published lists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The greater problem is that this system facilitates selling votes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After the election, an official receipt showing a certain vote will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably be able to be turned in for cash in many jurisdictions.
</em><br>
<p>That's a good point. I'm not sure if it's possible to avoid that
<br>
without sacrificing total user-auditability. After all, if the user
<br>
can prove to himself that his vote was counted correctly, he can
<br>
prove it to someone else. Frankly, though, I'm not convinced that
<br>
this is such a bad thing.
<br>
<p>Your suggested method requires a trusted party, and that's exactly
<br>
what we're trying to avoid. I want a system that /assumes/ the
<br>
government will do everything it can to cheat, because it will (and
<br>
has, many times).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here it may be getting a little too complex.  Many voters won't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ability to run these algorithms, especially the elderly, who vote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in large numbers.  I don't see why you can't just use the same receipt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers that are already on the ballot, though.
</em><br>
<p>That's a non-issue; I certainly don't expect every voter to sit down
<br>
and write code. I expect most of them to go to some public website's
<br>
&quot;vote check&quot; service, or to simply not bother. But it has to be
<br>
/possible/ for anyone to do it from scratch from published algorithms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There may also be a privacy concern here. Especially in smaller towns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinctive votes on certain issues may give people a good idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who certain ballots belong to. 
</em><br>
<p>That's a legitimate concern too. After all, if Fred Farkle got only
<br>
vote in his district, and Fred Farkle voted, there's a fair chance
<br>
that the vote was Fred Farkle's (and would therefore reveal his other
<br>
votes as well). The only around this is to use the system only for
<br>
large elections. For elections so small that this is a problm, a
<br>
simpler paper system is probably better anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, this auditing procedure looks reliable in theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I'm not sure that we could confidently say that it is as good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the present system.
</em><br>
<p>I can gurantee you it's better than the current system /as implemented/,
<br>
though perhaps not better than the current system as designed. The
<br>
design of the current system doesn't include polling place workers
<br>
dumping bags of ballots into a shredder, for example, or lots of votes
<br>
from dead folks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some elections are very close, and even a fraction of a percent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will swing the results.  If it were possible to get away with a small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of &quot;virtual ballot stuffing&quot; then people would lose confidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the system.
</em><br>
<p>People seem to have some irrational confidence in our current system,
<br>
which is totally broken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if they do get motivated and check the results the first few times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the years, they are likely to become careless.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, that's a big concern of mine, too. Eternal vigilance, and all that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The harder type of fraud to catch would be added votes, which means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting fake names onto the voter rolls.  I'm not sure how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vulnerability of your approach to this problem would compare with how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are done today.
</em><br>
<p>About the same, I imagine.
