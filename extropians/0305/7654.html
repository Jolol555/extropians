<a href="mailto:paatschb@optusnet.com.au?Subject=Re:%20[Politics]%20Re:%20The%20United%20Nations:%20Unfit%20to%20govern">paatschb@optusnet.com.au</a> writes: In my opinion the distrust is not 
<br>
anti-American. It is the distrust of the disenfranchised and the 
<br>
disempowered. It is the same sort of sentiment that caused an earlier 
<br>
generation of Americans to go to war to assert their rights not to be taxed 
<br>
(governed) without being represented. 
<br>
<p>Brett,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to understand that many serious and sincere Americans read 
<br>
statements like that and in fact as your entire set of comments as being 
<br>
largely an attempt to sell America a big piece of phony baloney.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to also understand that many serious and sincere Americans 
<br>
saw a threat out of Sadaam and out of the Al Qaida.  We do not intend to live 
<br>
under that threat.  In fact we are still proceeding against what remains of 
<br>
the Sadaam machine as well as the other terrorists.  I think at this point 
<br>
the only way you are going to impress the majority of Americans that you are 
<br>
proposing something sincere and effectual is to have you announce that you 
<br>
intend to defend us yourself and then proceed to do so.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might begin by reading the Egyptian newspaper and then financing a 
<br>
drive to bring their newspaper columnists into the real world.  They are 
<br>
conducting a verbal holy war against the Americans and the Israelis 
<br>
reminiscent of the propaganda campaign of Hitler against the Jewish citizenry 
<br>
of his own country -- of course we all remember how that ended don't we?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am truly sorry to find myself on the opposite side of this question 
<br>
from you but if you wish me to join you then you will have to offer me more 
<br>
than either to stand nobly silent while my throat is cut or to wring my hands 
<br>
and exclaim &quot;woe is me, I am so bad&quot; while you and others mouth a propaganda 
<br>
campaign against my country.  We have done nothing but defend ourselves from 
<br>
violent threats.  I beg you to understand that we do not regard it as nice of 
<br>
you (plural, the people you defend) to kill Americans by the thousands nor to 
<br>
threaten to do so.  We will do it again.
<br>
Ron h.
