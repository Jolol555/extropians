<p>
IMO, the points recently raised by M.L. vis-a-vis the
<br>
CNN/congressional debate on assault weapons point out
<br>
how out of touch with the &quot;leading edge&quot; most of the
<br>
public/politicians and perhaps even extropians(?) may be.
<br>
<p>I took an opportunity at the recent Foresight S.A.
<br>
conference to stand up and point out that I had
<br>
the genomic sequence of the SARS virus on my computer,
<br>
I had access to the machines and resources necessary
<br>
to recreate it.  (This effort would not be much
<br>
different from the recent efforts that recreated
<br>
the polio virus.)  I also pointed out that I could
<br>
return to the conference in the next year and easily
<br>
infect everyone attending with the SARS virus.
<br>
<p>There are at least two other individuals from time to
<br>
time contributing to this list (Aubrey de Grey and
<br>
Rafal Smigrodski) who I am sure have equivalent
<br>
knowledge bases and perhaps half a dozen individuals
<br>
I can think of who could rapidly develop such a
<br>
knowledge base.  (So my perspective is hardly unique.)
<br>
<p>What Mike (and the congresspersons) seem to be
<br>
forgetting is that as we move into the future
<br>
the (historic) weapons debate may well become
<br>
pointless (sound and fury signifying nothing?).
<br>
<p>An interesting exercise for extropes might be to
<br>
consider -- &quot;What fraction of individuals on
<br>
the Extropian list could I not easily defend
<br>
myself against should someone decide that I should
<br>
be toast?&quot;
<br>
<p>This is the question that one may be dealing with with
<br>
the increasing frequency of suicide bombers (i.e. they
<br>
don't care if they survive) and/or the cleverness
<br>
(increasingly high tech tools) of assassins.
<br>
<p>(Of course these questions are based in my perspective
<br>
that Americans have the right to &quot;keep and bear arms&quot;.
<br>
But my emphasis would be on the idea that ineffective
<br>
arms aren't worth the time spent discussing them.)
<br>
<p>I'll simply observe that assault weapons are
<br>
unlikely to stop the momentum of an SUV packed
<br>
with C4 and they don't help much with the
<br>
SARS virus spread in large quantities over the
<br>
envelope in your mailbox.
<br>
<p>Robert
