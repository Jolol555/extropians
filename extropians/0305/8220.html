<em>&gt; (Anders Sandberg &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Right%20and%20left%20liberal%20and%20conservative">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This right-left liberal- conservative thing has always confused me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conservatives are supposed to be in favor of Low taxes and preventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; women from having abortions but what does one have to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other? It's the same with wanting rigid anti drug laws and school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vouchers too, I just don't see why it has to be a package deal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is about underlying ideology, something which quite a few politicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and citizens forget these days but which actually has rather profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling effects on ideas. Conservatism is in the abstract about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conserving existing institutions against change, liberalism (American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense, social democracy in Europe) is based on the idea of using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to create equality, and so on. These core ideas can be quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex structures (look at Marxism), and often ally with ideas and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups with similar interests. Then political reality intrudes and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people start making compromises, deals and promises to maximize votes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the ideology part gets very diluted and hidden. But it exists deep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down and should not be ignored. One can reach the conclusion &quot;school 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vouchers are good&quot; from both a conservative and a libertarian position, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but that doesn't mean they are identical or should always cooperate.
</em><br>
<p>The rhetoric may be about ideology, but the realities of politics are
<br>
about constituency. People /say/ they want politicians to do the right
<br>
thing; but /vote/ for politicians that are &quot;on their side&quot;, and they
<br>
often don't see the difference.
<br>
<p>Sure, you can support school vouchers from either a conservative or
<br>
liberal ideology, but if your liberal party gets lots of contributions
<br>
from teachers unions scared to death that they might have to work for a
<br>
living, you're going to oppose vouchers, and make up some liberal-
<br>
sounding excuse like &quot;the poor will be badly educated&quot;. Almost any
<br>
position can be supported by an argument from either ideology: the
<br>
trick is to get the largest number of people to give you money by
<br>
giving them what they want while /appearing/ to be ideologically
<br>
motivated, because people perceive ideological motivations as more
<br>
reliable than expedient ones, even if they're fake.
