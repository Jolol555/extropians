<p><em>&gt; .. you might try asking the survey question this way: do you

</em><br>
<p>Favor it in relation to what though? The prospect of Libya 
<br>
&quot;championing&quot; human rights certainly doesn't appeal to me 
<br>
personally. But at this stage in civilization we (humanity) don't 
<br>
get to do things in fine brush strokes. Its crude broad brush 
<br>
strokes and ugly compromises only. But simply because there
<br>
are no all pleasant choices in how to organise or establish 
<br>
international law doesn't mean we can't find optimals amongst
<br>
the unpleasant choices.
<br>
<p>Perhaps it really is the case that the UN needs to be put out of
<br>
its misery to clear a path for a better institution. But to reach that
<br>
sort of conclusion it would seem prudent to make sure we have
<br>
a pretty good idea of what was systemically wrong with it in the
<br>
first place. 
<br>
<p>I don't have pat answers. I do think that these are genuinely 
<br>
extropic problems though. Or to put it another way. Whether we
<br>
(extropes) are capable of handling these issues or not, it is not like
<br>
we can live in an oasis free from the problems of the rest of the
<br>
world. All the problems of this generation are ours, not just the
<br>
technological ones, as are the consequences of whether we find
<br>
the solutions to them or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The UN charter is fundamentally based on the idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppressive governments, military dictatorships, inherited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monarchies, and other non-representative governments are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate and entitled to a voice in international affairs. Any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk of &quot;human rights&quot; is an afterthought; mere lip service from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an organization that serves to legitimize and perpetuate tyranny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accross the world.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There is a lot of truth in this I think. The first purpose of the UN
<br>
was and should be international peace and security. Without that
<br>
working the human rights stuff and the world court stuff is ultimately
<br>
farcical (and increasingly it is being seen to be farcical).
<br>
<p>It was in an effort to get the physical force, the military might
<br>
necessary to put power behind the UN resolutions that the
<br>
permanent security council members (US, UK, Russia, China,
<br>
and France - the victorious WW11 powers) became the 
<br>
permanent security council. 
<br>
<p>In these five was not high nobility. But there was, it seemed 
<br>
real military power, so long as they agreed. Hence the importance
<br>
of the veto. Any one of the five could effective stymie a resolution
<br>
by the others and deprive it of UN legitimacy if they so choose. Of
<br>
such imperfect compromises was the current UN forged. And as
<br>
I understand it much of the dissatisfaction with the UN amongst
<br>
ordinary folk seems to me to have been based on this 
<br>
misunderstanding of the power of the veto. I think many folks
<br>
not understanding the structure of the UN were constantly surprised
<br>
at it manifest failures to deliver what they regarded as just outcomes.
<br>
It was never more than a crude instrument. In practice any one of 
<br>
the five permanent security council members could exercise
<br>
the veto a prevent a resolution that was not in their national 
<br>
interest. 
<br>
<p>But, in the five, there was at least some semblance of 
<br>
representativeness of the various peoples on the planet. Not directly
<br>
as citizens but at least as members of nations. But heres the rub, 
<br>
crude instrument or not, the UN is the best &quot;symbol&quot;, the best
<br>
effort, however bad, towards international law that we have had
<br>
so far. 
<br>
<p>Where do we go now?
