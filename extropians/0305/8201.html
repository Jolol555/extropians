<em>&gt; I have justified the comment and said why I made it now.  Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have not read it.   I beg your pardon?  I was not actively rooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the victory of any 'murderous regime'.
</em><br>
<p>In your comment to me, when asked why you hold Fumento morally culpable for
<br>
AIDS deaths in Africa, you stated &quot;He was busy insisting that AIDS was a
<br>
non-heterosexual problem and thus lending sanction to those who chose to
<br>
ignore it as a &quot;gay problem&quot; and even &quot;the wrath of God&quot; instead of doing
<br>
very much about it.  The result, of course not limited to him, was many
<br>
millions of needless deaths...&quot; and &quot;He wrote what he wrote despite the
<br>
evidence [to the contrary]...I hold supposed intellectuals who twist the
<br>
truth responsible for the consequences of being believed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Would it be fair to rephrase this contextually to say &quot;He was busy insisting
<br>
that being concerned about something [heterosexual AIDS transmission] was
<br>
senseless and thus lended sanction to those who chose to ignore that
<br>
something instead of doing something about it, resulting in many millions of
<br>
deaths and seriously compromised health of millions more&quot; and &quot;He said this
<br>
despite evidence to the contrary, and can be held morally culpable for being
<br>
believed&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, given that contextually rephrasing, by your own criteria, you can be
<br>
hald morally accountable for the deaths in Indochina.  Rewording your above
<br>
statement with Indochina related events reveals:
<br>
<p>&quot;She was busy insisting that something [our involvment] was senselss thus
<br>
lended sanction to those who chose to ignore it as something else [colonial
<br>
expansionism of the US, a revolution in vietnam, all for tin/oil, etc]
<br>
instead of doing very much about it.  The result, of course not limited to
<br>
her, was many millions of needless deaths...&quot; and &quot;She wrote what he wrote
<br>
despite the evidence [to the contrary]...I hold supposed intellectuals who
<br>
twist the truth responsible for the consequences of being believed.&quot;
<br>
<p>And here you say nearly exactly that
<br>
<p>I was rooting for the end
<br>
<em>&gt; of our senseless and murderous involvment in a pseudo-war we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never have entered.
</em><br>
<p>Now clearly, by your own criteria, promoting something that leads to the
<br>
death of people means you must bare some of the blame for those deaths.
<br>
<p>I certainly take issue with the accuracy of your summation of Fumento's
<br>
points, so perhaps you take issue with the accuracy of some of my points,
<br>
thus clearing you of any blame for the millions of deaths in Indochina.  I
<br>
would like to know which points you contest.
<br>
<p>The single most important point of contention seems to be that you do not
<br>
find the US's involvement in Indochina as a morally valid one in any shape
<br>
or form, and I consider it valid.  The involvement was certainly handled
<br>
poorly in many cases, and outwardly disgustingly in still others, yet the
<br>
principle of involvement remained a morally just one.  I wonder on what
<br>
moral justifcation your assessment that is was not on.  To not put the
<br>
spotlight solely on  you, I will outline the moral justification I feel we
<br>
had (actually that morally required us) to get involved in the Indochina
<br>
conflict.
<br>
<p>1) South Vietnam requested our assistance in defending their soveriegnty, to
<br>
which we agreed
<br>
2) North Vietnam, a communist, murderous, dictatorship invaded South
<br>
Vietnam, intent on 'unification' or 'liberation' against the will of the
<br>
majority in the south
<br>
3) It is morally valid to defend people against acts of aggression,
<br>
especially when asked and agreed
<br>
4) The United States had the military and tactical capability to defeat
<br>
North Vietnam
<br>
5) The Vietnam war was essentially a proxy war between the US and the Soviet
<br>
Union, one which the North could have never hoped to win without the
<br>
trmendous Soviet aide.
<br>
6) The Soviet Union was a murderous regime, whos empire had expanded a
<br>
significant percentage in the previous decade, and was intent on enslaving
<br>
the population of South Vietnam and neighboring Cambodia, Laos, and
<br>
Thailand.  The largest Soviet military installation outside the USSR was in
<br>
Cam Rahn Bay, in South Vietnam.
<br>
7) The United States had reason to believe that horror would befall the
<br>
people of Indochina should this effort fail
<br>
<p>These were the essential variables available when reviewing the event in
<br>
historical context.  Today we have even greater context to judge the
<br>
morallity / immorality of involvment.  I invite you to dispute any of these
<br>
facts.
<br>
<p>1) The Khmere Rouge could not have taken over Cambodia, and subsequently
<br>
slaughtered a third of its population if the now unnoccupied North
<br>
Vietnamese Army had not decimated the Pro Western well armed now abandoned
<br>
army of Lon Nol.
<br>
2) No country has done more to spread democracy and freedom throughout the
<br>
World that the United States
<br>
3) The united states SAVED the ENTIRE WORLD, TWICE, THIS CENTURY, once
<br>
against facism, and subsequently against murderou communism.
<br>
4) Communism has killed 150 - 170 million people this century.
<br>
<p>We signed a treaty agreeing to protect South Vietnam in the event of an
<br>
invasion.  An invasion perpetrated by an oppressive murderous tyranical
<br>
regime.  An invasion supplied and armed by two of the three worst murderous
<br>
governments this planet has ever experienced.  Fighting the expansion of a
<br>
murderous regime bent on world domination was senseless?  Fighting the
<br>
enslavement of millions of people was senseless?  170 million people, this
<br>
century, died from communist regimes.  2 - 3 million died in Cambodia.  1
<br>
million died in Vietnam after the US abandonment of the region.  Thats a lot
<br>
of deaths.  Deaths which it can be argued you share some portion of the
<br>
moral culpability for since you A)supported the ending of efforts to prevent
<br>
said horrors and B)contributed by that support to the end of the efforts to
<br>
prevent said horrors.  In rooting for the 'end' of our 'involvement' (not a
<br>
quickening of a success) you rooted for the abandonment of the people of
<br>
Indochina to the worst murderous political system this world has ever seen.
<br>
You complain about our loss of freedoms domestically, yet ignore the fact
<br>
that the people of Vietnam enjoy fewer freedoms today than they did in 1960,
<br>
a situation which you contributed to.
<br>
<p>It was senseless to help defend these people?  What is senseless was your
<br>
idealogically opposition forged in a geopolical vacuum.  Its time to come to
<br>
terms with your past, perhaps in your bohemian charged youth, you saw this
<br>
as a worthy cause, you no doubt felt our involvement was principally unjust.
<br>
Your counterculture hippie social group saw fit to criticize anything and
<br>
everything that was immoral in the US, except you only seemed, and still
<br>
seem, to care about people in the US, and cared not about the peoples of the
<br>
Indochina region of the world.
<br>
<p>I recall recently you described your vote in the recent election as the
<br>
'Lesser of two evils'  The lack of recognition of this concept in regards to
<br>
US Foriegh policy post WWII is I believe the primary reason for your near
<br>
whole condemnation of US forieng Policy.  A while back I invited you to
<br>
embark on a detailed examination of US Foriegn policy actions post WWII and
<br>
to deem them just or unjust with the information known at that time, I
<br>
received no response.
<br>
<p>Today the truth is known, The Anti-war protestors of the sixties were
<br>
hi-jacked by communists and used as a tool by the North Vietnamese against
<br>
the Americans.  Protests you took part in.  Nearly every single military
<br>
conflict was a victory in Vietnam, what was senseless was the wanton and
<br>
callous disgregard for human life, freedom, and dignity exhibited by the
<br>
anti-war movement of the Vietnam era.  While many would reasonably consider
<br>
much of Johnson's handling of the war as 'senseless' what was not senseless
<br>
was our efforts to prevent a cancerous and despotic regime from forcibly
<br>
spreading and enslaving millions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not once again be dragged into the very imho revisionist views some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here hold of the Vietnam fiasco.
</em><br>
<p>I suppose you are just unable to come to terms with the fact the your direct
<br>
actions helped lead to the murder of millions of people and the enslavement
<br>
of 10's of millions.  You were too busy opposing the US uncritically to look
<br>
at the horrific murderous regimes spreading throughout the world that the US
<br>
was fighting.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a whole world of difference.   If you
<br>
<em>&gt; can not see the difference then I don't see we have an basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further dialogue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I invite you to counter my points made for the US intervention bieng morally
<br>
just in principal, or explain how this is revisionist, as opposed to the
<br>
fact that the general media and education system dont mention Vietnam from
<br>
the moment the US left until clinton 'closed that sad chapter' and re-opened
<br>
trade.  Ask high school kids how many US soldiers were killed and Vietnam
<br>
and they will more than likely know the answer, and then ask them how many
<br>
cambodians were killed, or how many South Vietnamese were killed, or how
<br>
much aide Russia was pumping into Vietnam, or how many people stalin killed,
<br>
or mao... etc. etc.  See what answers they give, and then see what history
<br>
is 'revionist'  and which history is an accurate description of the real
<br>
geopolitical climate and motivations involved.
<br>
<p>Last question, if the US had won that conflict in a manner similiar to the
<br>
Korean Conflict, do you think we would have seen the same massive and
<br>
widespread slaughter that we ended up seeing with the US Withdrawel?  I know
<br>
you have admittedly little to comment on the Korean War (which was nearly
<br>
identical in context to the vietnam war) but had the North Korean communists
<br>
won the Korean War, would we be seeing a vibrant democratic and economic
<br>
powerhouse in a unified and 'liberated' communist Korea, or would Kim Jong
<br>
Il merely have a million more postures and statues up of himself with 4
<br>
million starving every year instead of 2.
