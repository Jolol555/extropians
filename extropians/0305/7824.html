One of the problems with name calling is that it can backfire.  If they
<br>
turn out to be right about something that you said made them an &quot;idiot&quot;,
<br>
then it makes people think that they might be right about more than that,
<br>
and you wrong.

<p>On February 16, he wrote, also quoting her:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt;and conducted bombing runs on various manufacturing centers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;on the grounds that perhaps they could somehow be used for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps? For good or bad very soon now we are going to know for sure if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam has weapons of mass destruction or not, you seem to be predicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he does not, I'm predicting he does.
</em><br>
<p>So far, no WMD have been found.  None were used in the war.  There's been
<br>
some paperwork, some rumors, but no actual chemicals.  Maybe there will
<br>
be some found eventually, I don't know.
<br>
<p>But in the vitriolic exchange between John and Samantha, one of the
<br>
issues was John's prediction that WMD would be found.  At this point,
<br>
it looks like that may well be incorrect.  Fine; we all make mistakes.
<br>
Certainly the war did not go as I expected, either.
<br>
<p>Here is where the name-calling comes in.  Making a mistake is one thing.
<br>
But calling your opponent an &quot;idiot&quot; for taking a position opposite to
<br>
yours raises the stakes.  As John said, messages get saved.  When we go
<br>
back and see that John was wrong (so far) on such a high-stakes issue, it
<br>
makes him look extremely unreasonable to have called Samantha an idiot.
<br>
<p>It makes it look like Samantha is not an idiot at all.  And maybe John
<br>
was not only wrong on this issue, but was resorting to name-calling as
<br>
an excuse to cover up weak arguments.
<br>
<p>That's how things look when you call people names and then turn out to
<br>
be wrong.
<br>
<p>Name-calling is not a good idea, no matter how sure you are.  This is
<br>
email, not a hasty and shouted argument.  There's always time to be
<br>
polite.
