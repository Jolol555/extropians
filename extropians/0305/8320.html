Ablainey stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;This for me was one of the most conclusive pieces of evidence that much of 
<br>
the news coverage of the war was little more than Theatrics and propaganda.
<br>
I watched all the live coverage the night Jessica Lynch was Ahem... 
<br>
'rescued'. I saw the breaking news reports, as the word spread. Most 
<br>
important of all, I saw the live broadcast from the hospital barley a few 
<br>
hours after it happened. This was shown on SKY news. I didn't see any US 
<br>
correspondents at the hospital, despite switching between CNN and FOX. 
<br>
Strange as Fox is SKY's sister company. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, now that this story is 24 hours old, denials from (Ret) Major Daniel 
<br>
Hunt, on FoxNews, have disputed the BBC story as being full of holes. One 
<br>
story had US Forces firing blanks, which is untrue. The second claim that the 
<br>
hospital was unguarded is also untrue, since the hospital was guarded by 25 
<br>
armed Fedayeen. 
<br>
<p>The BBC reported the massacre of thousands of Arab civilians, in Jenin, in 
<br>
April 2002 on the West Bank, unverified and given to the BBC by the PA. A 
<br>
later UN examination of Jenin listed 57 verified fatalities, not thousands. 
<br>
Most all of the killed were combatants. BBC misreporting was also apparent in 
<br>
the American attacks against the Chetnik regime in Bosnia, but thats another 
<br>
story, in a long line of stories, not honest reporting, performed by the 
<br>
Leftist BBC. I am convinced that all news orgs lie; but I as a reader, must 
<br>
try to discern, which one is lying the least, so that I can know what is 
<br>
true. I suggest that all list members keep this in mind, and not swallow 
<br>
published statements so whole heartedly.
