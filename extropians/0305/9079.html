In my humble and entirely biased opinion, this is a very important effort
<br>
that Aubrey de Grey and his team are making. For further information on the
<br>
good that research prizes do, read:

<p>Fundamental anti-aging research is in the doldrums, and needs invigorating.
<br>
Time and time again, research prizes have proven their worth in stimulating
<br>
growth in a field of scientific endeavor. The return on investment is
<br>
amazingly large.
<br>
<p>This Methuselah Mouse prize is a first step towards engaging and interesting
<br>
those with much, much more money: a later goal would be setting up
<br>
multi-million-dollar prizes for proven interventions in the human aging
<br>
process. If it does well, we will all live that much longer. Reinvigorating
<br>
real, meaningful scientific anti-aging research is a vital goal.
<br>
<p>I wholeheartedly encourage you all to contribute; this is probably the best
<br>
opportunity most of you will see to leverage affordable dollar amounts into
<br>
extending your lives. I can't overemphasise how important this is: I
<br>
personally know of hundreds of thousands of dollars waiting in the wings to
<br>
see how this prize does, and I have to be the least connected person in this
<br>
industry.
<br>
<p>In the grand tradition of money and mouths, I just donated in $1000 to the
<br>
prize on behalf of the Longevity Meme. I wish I was wealthier and could do
<br>
more.
<br>
<p>So come on, step up to the plate and show us all that these lists can do
<br>
more than talk about life extension!

<em>&gt; Subject: Methuselah Mouse Prize for world record oldest mouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is to let you know about a new initiative designed to further the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of truly effective anti-aging interventions, by promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public interest and involvement in research on mammalian life extension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and by encouraging more such research to be done.  It's called the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Methuselah Mouse Prize, and it will be launched at the American Aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Association conference on Sunday June 8th (11:45am at the Harbor Court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hotel, 550 Light Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202-6099), where we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the inaugural award to Andrzej Bartke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In brief, it is a prize for producing the world's longest-ever-lived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mouse.  The amount awarded is determined by the size of the prize fund,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to which anyone can contribute, and by the margin by which the record
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is broken.  For more details see the Prize site:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      <a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/mmp/">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/mmp/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The two things that the prize needs in its early stages are publicity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and donors.  Even though we will not be trying to get huge sums into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the prize fund for a while, having a lot of small donations will add
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable credibility to the enterprise.  Contributions can be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up-front (by credit card online) unless they are big (over $25,000) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which case we are taking legally-bound pledges.  All donors will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listed on the Prize web site unless they prefer to remain anonymous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please publicise this initiative in any way you can!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cheers, Aubrey de Grey
