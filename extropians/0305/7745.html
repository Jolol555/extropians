<p>Nothing wrong with clams, but linguini has practically no food value
<br>
relative to other foods. It is a starchy grain product with very little
<br>
nutritional value relative to the calories it contains. I might say it has
<br>
value for flavor alone, but I think linguini is pretty dismal without the
<br>
high-saturated-fat cheese sauces that generally go along with it. 
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong: like you I love linguini and with Parmigian cheese. But
<br>
these threads are not about what tastes good. They are about what is good
<br>
for us.
<br>
<p>Unlike in paleo times, good tasting foods are plentiful now. Modern economic
<br>
forces have provided easy access to good tasting foods beyond anything we
<br>
could have dreamed in paleo times. If we all ate only what tastes best today
<br>
then we'd all be fat and destined to die before it is necessary. And sadly
<br>
that is pretty much the state of affairs here in 21st century America.
<br>
<p>One thing I've learned from following a paleo diet is that the palate can be
<br>
trained to appreciate natural paleo foods. I never cared much for fruits and
<br>
vegetables during my youth, or even in my adulthood when I knew they were
<br>
good for me and should have had the will-power to eat them. I did not truly
<br>
enjoy the flavor of fruits and vegetables until I stopped indulging in
<br>
high-fat, high-carb, non-paleo foods. Now fruits and vegetables, especially
<br>
fruits, are incredible to me. There is nothing more delicious to me than a
<br>
handful of chilled blueberries. I'm sure my very remote ancestors felt the
<br>
same way.
