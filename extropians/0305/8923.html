<em>&gt; &gt; It mentions the annoying result that &quot;if two or more Bayesians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would believe the same thing given the same information (i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have &quot;common priors&quot;), then those individuals cannot knowingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disagree.  Merely knowing someone else's opinion provides a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; powerful summary of everything that person knows, powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough to eliminate any differences of opinion due to differing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information.&quot;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I would contend that even perfectly rational altruists could differ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; significantly about their recipes for the perfect world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me the problem is simple in concept, but limited in practice.  We can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never have absolute agreement between any two entities, due to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different knowledge bases (experiences).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, although I'm sure that you meant to mention that each rational
<br>
being ought to regard the other as a truth-machine of approximately
<br>
the same verisimilitude at himself.  That is, as has been stressed 
<br>
in the writings at hand, we can learn to count on others as much as
<br>
we count on ourselves.  (Indeed, I do rely on at least one of my
<br>
friends in this precise way.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, two rational beings can approach agreement as precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as desired by analyzing and refining their differences.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting to note that all belief systems fit perfectly into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total web of beliefs that exist.  It couldn't be otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we accept that the universe itself is consistent.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From this we might infer that superrationality is what you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you extrapolate any more limited concept of rational behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a timeless setting. This seems particularly apropos to extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who hope and plan to live forever.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think I know what you are saying.  Certainly if in the non-iterated
<br>
Prisoners Dilemma I begin to suspect that the other player is myself, either
<br>
a freshly minted duplicate or a self from another time, then my incentive
<br>
to Defect vanishes.  (Because I see Lee Corbin getting benefit no matter
<br>
&quot;who&quot; wins.)
<br>
<p>Now then, timelessness also invites one to confuse a present setting with
<br>
members of the set of all equivalent settings.  I shall refer to the atavistic
<br>
axioms of Kolmogorov, (which are all that I believed until indoctrinated by
<br>
the present ilk of Bayesians who infest these lists).  My interpretation of 
<br>
Kolmogorov axioms were just this: say one has tossed a die high into the
<br>
air, and then just as it hit the table, slapped a hat on top of it so that
<br>
one cannot see the value that the die has assumed.  Then on the one hand
<br>
we accept that the die has assumed a definite value (and is not really in
<br>
any sort of superposition of all six possibilities).  My interpretation of
<br>
the K axioms was that we are invited to deliberately confuse the present
<br>
circumstances with all those other historical cases in which a die has 
<br>
been tossed (Kolmogorov's &quot;class G&quot;).  Then from this vast sample, the
<br>
theoretical fraction of instances in which the &quot;six&quot; is showing is one-sixth!
<br>
And thus we have probability.
<br>
<p>It is possible that you meant something like this by your &quot;timelessness&quot;.
<br>
<p>As for superrationality itself---as originally defined by Hofstadter and
<br>
others---it's merely the mistaken doctrine that one should Cooperate in
<br>
the non-iterated Prisoners Dilemma under the normal conditions that the
<br>
adversary is not a version of oneself (and therefore has behavior completely
<br>
uncorrelated with one), and that one is not an altruist.  The values in the
<br>
Table say &quot;Defect&quot;, and I think that that is all there is to it (given the
<br>
Totally correct assessment of the non-Repeatability of the PD).
