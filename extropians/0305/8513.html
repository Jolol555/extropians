or Saddam Hussein, and we apparently haven't stopped Al Qaeda.  The world's

<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you read the modern books on military strategy and tactics you will 
<br>
find that is exactly what all the talk of asymmetrical warfare is about.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military theoreticians divide a nation's war making capacity into 
<br>
four levels:
<br>
1st level --    the US and only the US.
<br>
2nd level --   England and some others.  I don't have a specific list.
<br>
3rd level --    I don't have a list for you.  Probably Iraq.
<br>
4th level --    Most of the 3rd world countries.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key thing to notice is that the US has trained so many 2nd, 3rd and 
<br>
4th world countries that they all know American strategy and tactics right 
<br>
down to the dotted i's and crossed t's.  Consequently they have all worked 
<br>
diligently on developing asymmetrical tactics and strategy to counter known 
<br>
US methods.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the reason asymmetrical tactics haven't worked better is that 
<br>
we have worked on defending against them.  That is why the opposition has not 
<br>
been able to use the protest movement as effectually as they did during 
<br>
Vietnam.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested the books are around.  Our military 
<br>
theoreticians wrote the ones I have seen.  Mostly they discuss battles and 
<br>
campaigns where we had problems due to good tactics on the part of the 
<br>
opposition.  Those are the ones we can learn from.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to knowing where bin Laden is?  It would be nice to catch him, but, 
<br>
so long he is living in fear in some hovel in Pakistan and afraid to even use 
<br>
his cell phone to coordinate either attacks or defense haven't we got time on 
<br>
our side.  Did you notice that the latest round of attacks were in Moslem 
<br>
countries.  Even the one in Saudi Arabia killed more Moslems than Americans.
<br>
