More to the point, we have decimated the population of wolves, courgars, 
<br>
etc., so the deer don't experience the predation that they evolved to 
<br>
expect.  Either we replace it somehow, or the deer suffer massively.  
<br>
I'm not convinced that hunters are more cruel than wolves or cougars.  
<br>
Birth control is expensive, difficult, and of questionable permanence 
<br>
(political climates change...rapidly).  So either you introduce a 
<br>
non-human predator, or you allow people to predate.  There are plusses 
<br>
and minuses to both solutions, but predators that will attack deer are 
<br>
all too likely to attack vulnerable humans, if the hunting is poor.  And 
<br>
the reaction to that will be to restrict the range of the predator, 
<br>
which will leave the deer...
<br>
<p>Also, if people predate on deer, they will tend to avoid human 
<br>
habitations.  And gardens.  (Not sufficiently to avoid the need for 15 
<br>
foot tall fences, but enough to help.)  If deer are invoilate, then they 
<br>
will invade gardens freely.  (Around where I live, more deer are killed 
<br>
by cars than by guns...considerably more.  And that's dangerous to the 
<br>
driver, but deer aren't careful pedestrians, and can't always be avoided.)
<br>
<p>I'm not particularly informed about fishing, perhaps sport fishing is 
<br>
different, but my understanding is that commercial fishing vastly 
<br>
overfishes the areas that they fish in.  This is a variant of the 
<br>
tragedy of the commons.  Boats don't have their own herds of fish, so 
<br>
they don't have any direct penalty from avoiding overfishing one, and 
<br>
they do get a direct advantage, but if several different boats overfish 
<br>
several different schools of fish, they all suffer.  (This is 
<br>
oversimplified, as fish aren't territorial in the way that is implied, 
<br>
but it's a reasonable first cut.)  OTOH, another part is just the 
<br>
short-term profit view of modern companies.  Forrestry companies do the 
<br>
same thing.  Traditional family businesses would do a rotated harvest of 
<br>
a forest, allowing one area to come to maturity while harvesting 
<br>
another.  Modern corporations clear cut an area, and then sell it off to 
<br>
developers, destroying the forest in the process.  (Yes, as I described 
<br>
it, it's illegal.  But the laws have lots of loopholes, and the 
<br>
corporations have lawyers to find them...or helped write the laws in the 
<br>
first place.)  This doesn't give them a sustained return, but it gives 
<br>
them a larger quick return, that they can then invest elsewhere.  (So 
<br>
perhaps short-term is the wrong criticism...but I don't know what 
<br>
descriptive term would be more appropriate.)
