Anders says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I think one could usefully (for our discussions) add a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third axis: technological coercion. Some people want to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what and how technology is used and developed, others want to leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this free and legislate when actual problems develop. So there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an issue of technological freedom, or freedom to tinker.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we get the following cube (I won't try to ascii it), with +
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representing freedom:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tech   Social  Economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -      -       -      Anti tech authoritarians (reactionaries)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -      -       +      Anti tech conservatives (Kass, Fukyama)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -      +       -      Anti tech liberals (Rifkin)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   -      +       +      Anti tech libertarians (small is good?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   +      -       -      Pro tech authoritarians (high tech fascism,
</em><br>
prometheans)
<br>
<em>&gt;   +      -       +      Pro tech conservatives (good for business)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   +      +       -      Pro tech liberals (left transhumanism?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   +      +       +      Pro tech libertarian (&quot;classical&quot; extropianism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of these combinations are less common than others. People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepting social and economic freedom but not technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom seem to be rare, but I think I have encountered a few.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most seem to want a free &quot;small is good&quot; society with no roaring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The content provider fraction is strongly against technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom (at least for others) but does not have much political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology; I would guess they are pro economic freedom (at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them), so they would be somewhere in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authoritarian-conservative-centrist region.
</em><br>
<p>This is very helpful. I remember that back in the 1970s Nigel Calder had a
<br>
chapter in his book &quot;Technopolis&quot; that argued for an emerging political
<br>
division between &quot;mugs and zealots&quot; on the basis of differing attitudes to
<br>
technology that was very similar to this. I have a similar take on the
<br>
politics of the last 250 years (roughly), i.e. that there are broadly two
<br>
kinds of variable, producing four kinds of combinations. These are liberty
<br>
vs authority (do you trust people to make decisions and let those decisions
<br>
aggregate through markets and other mechanisms or do you think most people
<br>
can't be trusted to make good decisions or their aggregated decisions will
<br>
be bad so you need some kind of authority) and optimism vs pessimism (do you
<br>
broadly think that modernity is a good or a bad thing which includes the
<br>
view you take of technological progress). This produces
<br>
<p>Optimistic libertarians (classical liberals/libertarians)
<br>
Optimistic authoritarians (socialists/social democrats)
<br>
Pessimistic libertarians (most Anglo-Saxon conservatives)
<br>
Pessimistic authoritarians (&quot;Throne and Altar&quot;/conservative revolutionaries
<br>
of the German and French type)
<br>
<p>Anders' model is better because by separating out the attitude to technology
<br>
and science it enables you to locate some groups who otherwise pose problems
<br>
such as fascists. Worth saying that as ever the kind of debates we are
<br>
having now are not new. Anyone who thinks otherwise should read Macaulay's
<br>
review of Southey's &quot;Colloquies on Society&quot; (TBM does a fantastic job - we
<br>
need someone like that today!). I also think that both today and in the past
<br>
we can see periods when the main axis of debate shifts. In the 19th century
<br>
it's mainly Optimistic Libertarians vs Pessimistic Authoritarians because
<br>
most people who liked modernity and believed in progress thought that
<br>
&quot;progress&quot; meant a movement in the direction of less government and greater
<br>
individualism. In a generation around 1900 most &quot;optimists&quot; came to think
<br>
growing collective action through government was the path of progress. The
<br>
few remaining Optimitic Libertarians had to ally themselves with Pessimistic
<br>
Libertarians, opposed to Optimistic Authoritarians. I think that now we are
<br>
in the middle of another shift back to a more 19th century style axis. One
<br>
sign of this is the increasing similarity of argument (and increasingly
<br>
alliances) between people who are allegedly on opposite ends of the old way
<br>
of defining &quot;left and right&quot;.
