In this study the focus in on the antioxidants in fruits and veggies rather
<br>
than on the fiber they contain, but here again we see an inverse
<br>
relationship between cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and consumption of
<br>
fruits and vegetables.

Total antioxidant potential of fruit and vegetables and risk of gastric

cancer.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Dietary antioxidants, with additive and synergistic
<br>
effects, can mediate the observed inverse association between plant food
<br>
intake and risk of gastric cancer. We investigated whether the total dietary
<br>
antioxidant potential of fruit and vegetables is an appropriate means of
<br>
estimating the antioxidant impact on gastric cancer risk in a large
<br>
population-based study. METHODS: With a population-based case-control
<br>
design, data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 505 newly
<br>
diagnosed gastric adenocarcinoma patients and 1116 control subjects to
<br>
assess dietary habits 20 years before interview. The total radical-trapping
<br>
antioxidant potential (TRAP) of different plant foods was used to convert
<br>
food frequency intake into antioxidant potential. Gastric cancer risk in
<br>
groups exposed to higher levels of oxidative stress (smoking and
<br>
Helicobacter pylori infection) was also examined. RESULTS: Intake of
<br>
antioxidant equivalents was inversely associated with the risk of both
<br>
cardia and distal gastric cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% confidence
<br>
interval [CI], 0.48-0.89 for the highest quartile of TRAP). Controlling for
<br>
smoking, the inverse relationship between TRAP values displayed a clearer
<br>
dose-response pattern. Never-smokers with the highest antioxidant intake had
<br>
the lowest risk of cancer, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.27-0.71). Among H.
<br>
pylori-infected subjects, the ORs varied between 0.66 and 0.41 for
<br>
increasing levels of antioxidant potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest
<br>
that dietary intake of antioxidants measured as total antioxidant potential
<br>
is inversely associated with risk of both cardia and distal cancer. The
<br>
innovative approach used in this study provides a new tool for investigating
<br>
the relationship between dietary antioxidants and oxidative stress-related
<br>
carcinogenesis.
