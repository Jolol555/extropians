But more to the point, it's incorrectly framed.  There is nothing 
<br>
intrinsically wrong with GM foods just because they are GM, but any 
<br>
particular modification is a new variant, and may either remove 
<br>
desireable characteristics or add undesireable characteristics, as well 
<br>
as the converse.  And sometimes simultaneously.  And this relates to all 
<br>
food processing, not just to GM.  To take a well documented case:
<br>
<p>Brown rice doesn't store as well as rice that has been polished to 
<br>
remove the bran.  So to improve storage characteristics orientals began 
<br>
polishing it.  Currently this has become so common, that this is the 
<br>
only kind of rice that they eat.   About a century ago, however, it was 
<br>
discovered that doing so removes the B vitamins that had been 
<br>
traditionally present.  (Nothing would eat it because it was nearly pure 
<br>
starch, and dry.  So anything that tried, starved to death.)  So people 
<br>
who were living on it started to get beriberi.  It took a long time to 
<br>
trace this back to the rice polishing, and until this was done the 
<br>
problem couldn't be corrected.  (The correction was to add back some of 
<br>
what was removed...people had gotten used to only eating polished rice.)
<br>
<p>Note that people still usually eat polished rice.  But now the polished 
<br>
rice has been fortified with B vitamins.  There wasn't anything 
<br>
intrinsically wrong with polishing the rice.  But when people first 
<br>
started doing it, they couldn't predict all of the side effects, so a 
<br>
large number of people ended up dead and disabled.  And even more were 
<br>
sick and unhappy for a long time.
<br>
<p>GM is being handled the same way.  Soybeans are being modified to alter 
<br>
their phytochemical balance.  Good?  Bad?  It's a *different* food 
<br>
afterwards, and it should be considered fraud to sell it as the same 
<br>
thing.  You can't count on the same protein balance,  You can't count on 
<br>
the same mineral balance.  You can't count on the same taste.  Etc.  If 
<br>
you make tofu out of it, the tofu may have *different* nutritional 
<br>
characteristics.  Better?  Worse?  I can't tell, and it may depend on 
<br>
your genome/lifestyle.  But you can't tell the difference by looking, so 
<br>
it had *better* have a different name.
<br>
<p>The laws are irrational wrt GM products.  If peanuts were modified to 
<br>
remove the allergenic propertied, you still wouldn't be able to use them 
<br>
in products without the warning label &quot;Caution:  This product may 
<br>
contain peanuts...&quot;, but the new plant would be a fundamentally 
<br>
different plant, with different characteristics.  And if soybeans are 
<br>
modified to contain a less complete protein (which makes it cheaper to 
<br>
grow, and gives longer storage life, perhaps) they will be a 
<br>
fundamentally different plant.  If you call it the same thing, some 
<br>
people will end up with a protein diffency despite their best efforts.  
<br>
It's irrational to ban GM foods, but it's also even more irrational to 
<br>
ban the labeling of foods as GM, or even to not require it.  With GM 
<br>
foods, you can't depend on the standard nutritional refferences.
