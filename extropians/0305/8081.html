<p><em>&gt; &quot;Benfotiamine&quot; appears to be ordinary thiamine (vitamin B-1). At least I

</em><br>
<p>Correction: I see now that Benfotiamine is a fat soluble form of B-1, not
<br>
quite the same as the water soluble form usually found in supplements. It
<br>
has 3 x greater bioavailability than ordinary thiamine HCL. However I
<br>
question whether only the fat soluble form has physiologic activity as
<br>
claimed. 
<br>
<p>It is claimed that only the fat soluble form showed alphaETK activity, and
<br>
that this is evidence that only the fat soluble form has physiologic
<br>
activity. I'm not sure exactly what &quot;alphaETK&quot; is in biochemical terms as a
<br>
marker of physiologic activity of thiamine. However I know that alphaETK is
<br>
also a marker of thiamine deficiency as found often in alcoholics, and that
<br>
ordinary water-soluble thiamine HCL corrects that deficiency. This suggests
<br>
that the claim for Benfotiamine is false: ordinary water soluble thiamine
<br>
HCL also has physiologic activity as measured by alphaETK.
<br>
<p>Pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers have a bad habit of modifying
<br>
ordinary compounds slightly for little apparent reason other than to obtain
<br>
a patent. It is for that reason that I am always suspicious of modifications
<br>
of ordinary nutrients. Ordinary thiamine HCL is dirt cheap and I'm sure
<br>
&quot;Benfotiamine&quot; is quite expensive. If bioavailability is the only issue at
<br>
stake here then I'm sure it would be cheaper to buy 3 units of thiamine HCL
<br>
to get the same plasma thiamine level as 1 unit of Benfotiamine.
