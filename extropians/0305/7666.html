</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law that means anything someone has to be able to

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brett,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You have gotten to the crux of the your misunderstanding.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary American in overwhelming numbers does care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law. They have long been devoted to the love of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law.
</em><br>
<p>We have long thought that the UN operated much like our own government.
<br>
We have learned now that that is not the case. We have learned that it
<br>
is like Texas vetoing New Hampshire defending itself against Quebeois
<br>
terrorists because Texas was making good money selling Quebec TNT under
<br>
the table. That ain't America.
<br>
<p>Nor would we, at this time, accept a world government that was
<br>
structured more like our own, specifically because it is structured in
<br>
a winner-takes-all way, with the only protections being the courts, the
<br>
supermajority protection of constitutional rights, and the ability of
<br>
minority legislators to filibuster. We wouldn't trust it specifically
<br>
because the majority of the people in the world do not live in free
<br>
nations under trustable governments. It is bad enough that our own
<br>
liberties here are eroded by the power of immigrant laden big cities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    But that same American does not see his country receiving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law.  I think we see French and German conduct as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avaricious not as lawful -- there are others involved but those are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the leaders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        When you state lofty European positions attempting to &quot;reason&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with us we do not hear you as reasonable. We hear only a person that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is doing one thing strictly for his advantage and trying to talk us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into harming ourselves for his advantage.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said before, &quot;Phony baloney.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and it is starting to all come out, the financial shenanigans, the
<br>
bribery of UN officials, the laundering of smuggled oil money. The
<br>
files of the Iraqi intelligence service is indicting our opponents for
<br>
us. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised to find out that France was
<br>
hiding Iraqi chemical weapons for them. I would bet that the primary
<br>
reason the opposing countries were opposed was because they didn't want
<br>
the truth of their illegal dealings to be exposed once we won.
