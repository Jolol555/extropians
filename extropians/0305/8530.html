<p><em>&gt; ...an altruist could play against a selfist if the payoffs were

<em>&gt; Altruist Cooperate   |  Everyone in the world     |  Everyone in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                      |  gains $5                  |  loses $10 except selfist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                      |                            |  who gains $10.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                      -----------------------------+---------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Altruist Defect      |  Everyone in the world     |  Status quo; no gain, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                      |  gains $10 except selfist, |  loss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                      |  who loses $10             |
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question is whether the altruist would defect in this situation.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, quite ingenious.  I don't believe that Eliezer addressed this in
<br>
his reply.  Now what does the person playing rows, the altruist, know?
<br>
If he knows that he's playing another altruist, then of course he
<br>
Cooperates.  But I take it that he knows he's playing against a Selfist,
<br>
and the Selfist knows that he's playing an Altruist.  Now it seems to
<br>
me that the Altruist must &quot;defect&quot; (despite his constitution!).  The
<br>
payoff table seems to be clear on that point---unless you have a more
<br>
subtle interpretation than is occurring to me right now.  Therefore, 
<br>
the Selfist must anticipate this, and cooperate, on the chance... that
<br>
the Altruist will cooperate... but I've just said that won't happen.
<br>
Yes.  Very ingenious.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this falls under my dictum, then, that in PD you don't *have*
<br>
to defect if you don't know what your adversary is going to do.  Thus,
<br>
you *may* perhaps Cooperate.  Of course, if the $10 is not symbolic of
<br>
utility (which I have contended is the only possibility that renders
<br>
the game interesting), then of course the marginal utility of a $10
<br>
gain for most people is far outweighed by the marginal utility of a
<br>
$10 loss, for most of the population, who would find loss of ten U.S.
<br>
dollars to be catastrophic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was trying to set up a PD scenario between two rational altruists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is hard since they are both motivated the same way, to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total happiness of the world.  The only thing that could lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a difference in payoff for a particular outcome is disagreement about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how happy it would or does make people.  For example, supposed Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believed that average happiness were what mattered, while Lee believed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that total happiness were more important.  Then an outcome which increased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the population while making them more unhappy might be rated highly by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee but low by Eliezer.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're pretty on-target understanding *my* values!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, these hypotheticals don't really work, because rational people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't disagree!  See our previous discussion on this issue.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I've lost track of that.  Do you have a pointer?
<br>
