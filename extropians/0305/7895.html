As far as I remember, the source is:
<br>
\shared\groups\it\shared\GasData\dev\curr
<br>
<p>You want everything in there. The source is in the source folders, the
<br>
packages folder contains the package files for creating installable
<br>
packages, bin contains the latest compiled binaries, and bincompat contains
<br>
the binary compatibility binaries. Note that the binary compatibility
<br>
binaries should be treated as part of the source; they define how the
<br>
components of GasData talk to each other. You will have incredible trouble
<br>
updating GasData without the binary compatibility files being available
<br>
during the vb compilation process!

<em>&gt; Cold virus outsmarts, destroys brain tumors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Genetically engineered cells target only cancers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M.D. Anderson plans clinical trials for next year
</em><br>

<em>&gt; . Graphic: Virus kills brain tumors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Local scientists have turned a cold virus into a kind of &quot;smart bomb&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may be able to destroy the deadliest form of brain cancer. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In experiments with mice, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Center researchers are reporting that a genetically engineered version
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the common cold infected and killed malignant glioma cells that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resist other therapy. The virus doesn't harm normal tissue. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Viral therapy like this may be just what we need to treat a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disease like cancer,&quot; said Dr. Frederick Lang, a professor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurosurgery and primary investigator of the study. &quot;Cancer can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devious the way it does everything possible to avoid destruction, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viruses are equally tricky and may be able to outsmart brain tumors.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In today's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, M.D.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anderson researchers said the therapy produced a response on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glioma not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously seen with any other treatment. Clinical trials with people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are expected to begin late next year. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roughly 17,000 new cases of brain tumors are diagnosed in the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States every year and half are gliomas, a primary type which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arises from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain itself rather than metastasizing from another location.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surgery, radiation therapy, steroids and chemotherapy can prolong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival, but most everyone dies within a year. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The virus is designed in such a way that to reproduce itself, it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only replicate in cancer cells, not healthy tissue. While reproducing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it kills cancer cells, and when no more are left to infect, the virus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply dies. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea of using viruses to kill cancer cells has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1950s, but it is only in recent years that it is moving toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application. Therapeutic viruses for lung cancer and head and neck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancer are in clinical trials, said Howard Fine, director of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tumor program at the National Cancer Institute. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The NCI is providing $1 million to produce the drug-grade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therapy in its laboratories. It is scheduled to be finished in time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start enrolling patients in a study in the winter of 2004. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Fine warned against expecting too much from the therapy. He called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it &quot;a promising approach that is one of many good ideas out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there,&quot; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said success in animal models is a long way from success in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patients. He said it is unclear whether the virus will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicate as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in humans, where glioma cells are surrounded by normal cells; in mice,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glioma cells cluster together. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the results in the mice were extraordinary. The virus cured 60
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percent of the glioma tumors implanted in mice brains whereas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mice given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a placebo died after less than three weeks. (A precursor of the virus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cured 15 percent of the tumors.) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mice that survived treatment with the experimental virus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for examination. Researchers found only empty cavities and scar tissue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the tumors once were. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This therapy needs more study, but it has a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential,&quot; said Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Juan Fueyo, a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuro-oncology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the study's lead author and the developer of the genetically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adenovirus. &quot;We've never had this kind of result with any kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment on glioma -- in humans or animals.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The virus is injected directly into the brain tumor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surgically, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a small hole. Lang expressed hope the therapy might work even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans because delivery would be more precise. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Researchers are studying human adenoviruses for a wide range 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uses, from cancer therapy to gene therapy, because they are so good at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infecting human cells. One question is how the immune system will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond -- will it overreact and cause illness or kill the virus, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will it be boosted to kill the cancer or other pathogen. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Lang said he's optimistic the treatment will accomplish its goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the immune system goes after it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The research team also included scientists from the University of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alabama at Birmingham and the Institut Catala d'Oncologia in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Barcelona,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spain.
