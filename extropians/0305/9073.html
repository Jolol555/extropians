<p><em>&gt; Seems to fit my own impressions I got when I was doing starmaps

</em><br>
<p>Most excellent!  About 30 years ago I worked out all the coordinates
<br>
of the nearest 30 stars or so, and rotated them so that I could get
<br>
an &quot;objective&quot; view of the nearby stars, looking down upon the
<br>
galactic plane from above.  So then I had to correct a lot of the
<br>
imagery I had in mind as to &quot;where&quot; Alpha Centauri was with respect
<br>
to the solar system and to the galactic center, than I had unconsciously
<br>
picked up while reading SF.
<br>
<p>Your applet is perfect for this.  Now you mention
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The coordinate box enables or disables circles showing the distance 100, 1000 and 10000 lightyears from the sun, as well as the
</em><br>
coordinate axes in a heliocentric coordinate system with the X axis pointing at the galactic center.
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p>Okay, so the X axis (as it goes towards the right) is pointing to
<br>
galactic center.  (I have always understood that from our point of
<br>
view at Sol, Alpha Centauri and Proxima are at about 45 degrees to
<br>
the right when facing galactic center, and your applet seems to
<br>
corroborate this, and, luckily for SF, they lie in about the same
<br>
galactic plane as we do---i.e., the plane formed by the center of
<br>
the galaxy, Sol, and Alpha Centauri, is about the same as the
<br>
galactic plane.)  But you have the &quot;y&quot; axis pointing down, and
<br>
so, what direction is that pointing to in terms of our galaxy?
<br>
<p>If I assume, as you have written, that the X axis points to Galactic
<br>
Center, and, then visually, the Y axis (if it were to point upwards
<br>
on your diagram) should be pointing towards Deneb, approximately.
<br>
Hey, and so when I adjust the distance to about 1000+ ly, there is
<br>
Deneb where I want it!  All right!
<br>
<p>So it must be that we are (i) looking down on the galactic plane,
<br>
(ii) the *vertical* (not as you have shown it) Y axis is towards
<br>
galactic rotation (towards Deneb), and thus the positive Z axis
<br>
is towards the viewer, up out of the galactic plane.  Is this
<br>
all correct?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
