Harvey writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Above, I thought that this was simply a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; joke.  But it appears that the writer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; serious.  Of all the hare-brained ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; characterize liberals and conservatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [conservatives don't like different things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; liberals do], this takes the cake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the problem?  Haven't you people ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looked these terms up in the dictionary before? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sheesh!
</em><br>
<p>Well, no  :-)   But I've always known what here 
<br>
in the U.S. since at least 1960 lower-case
<br>
&quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; meant politically.
<br>
But the standard, non-political usage of the
<br>
terms is, as Damien supplied
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;liberal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adj 1: showing or characterized by broad-mindedness; &quot;a broad
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political stance&quot;; &quot;generous and broad sympathies&quot;; &quot;a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liberal newspaper&quot;; &quot;tolerant of his opponent's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opinions&quot; [syn: {broad}, {tolerant}]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;conservative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adj 1: resistant to change [ant: {liberal}]
<br>
<p>And we know how they came to be applied to the U.S.
<br>
left and right respectively.  The whole direction
<br>
of social change from 1776 through fairly modern
<br>
times had been leftward (and left and right, as
<br>
you also know, obtained from the seating arrangements
<br>
in the House of Commons).  As far back as the 
<br>
revolutionary war, &quot;Tory&quot; meant someone who supported
<br>
the king.  That indeed was a *conservative* position,
<br>
in the literal sense.
<br>
<p>Today, how could (for example) favoring reparations,
<br>
or advocating a minimum wage, possibly be &quot;liberal&quot;,
<br>
and freedom to own guns or advocating the repeal of
<br>
most taxation, possibly be &quot;non-liberal&quot; (in the
<br>
dictionary sense)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And when you've finally convinced yourself that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really understand what these English words mean,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide if you are at heart a &quot;conservative&quot; or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;liberal&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>There is no question but that all extropians and many
<br>
others are &quot;liberal&quot; by the dictionary definition,
<br>
when the nonpolitical meaning is meant.  Yet also,
<br>
there is no question that on many political issues,
<br>
a great many extropians and others greatly in favor
<br>
of novel ideas are politically &quot;conservative&quot;.
<br>
<p>I'm in favor of a lot of new and highly imaginative
<br>
projects, concerns, and ideas, such as cryonics, space
<br>
colonization, universe engulfing, AI development and
<br>
so on.  But today, a political liberal is defined
<br>
primarily as leaning towards socialism, towards 
<br>
tolerance in social relations, a meeker stance in
<br>
in international affairs, regulation of the free
<br>
market, and relative lenience towards prison inmates.
<br>
Except for tolerance in social relationships (which
<br>
it so happens I also favor), none of the rest of these
<br>
have anything to do with the dictionary definition of
<br>
&quot;liberal&quot;.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Nice shot there about Democrats getting elected
<br>
and Republicans being appointed ;-)   I suppose that
<br>
if the U.S. Supreme Court hadn't stepped in---and the
<br>
Florida Supreme Court had awarded the election to
<br>
Gore---we on the right would be making the same kind
<br>
of wisecracks about Democrats.
