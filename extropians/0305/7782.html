<p><em>&gt; ### So you are postulating a major chemical difference between fatty

</em><br>
<p>Major by the metric of degradability, yes.  Not nearly so much to humans
<br>
with hereditary hypercholesterolemia vs. aged humans, because the former
<br>
still take several years to form plaques, as opposed to weeks for the
<br>
apoE null mice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a legitimate hypothesis, but I'd need more data before I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept it.
</em><br>
<p>A key question is, are there any other comparably legitimate hypotheses?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Interestingly, there are some lucky seniors who even at age 80 do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have atherosclerosis. If indeed there was an inexorable accumulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indigestible material in most of us, how do they escape it? Would you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do not make such supposedly insoluble plaque (hard to imagine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cholesterol oxidizes the same way in all humans), or do they have superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lysosomal enzymes?
</em><br>
<p>Neither (well, not as the main factor anyway).  Centenarians' arteries have
<br>
lots of fatty deposits.  The main difference is that their vascular smooth
<br>
muscle is less prone to get inflamed and hyperplastic as a result of the
<br>
presence of this nasty stuff: i.e., they are better protected at the next
<br>
step.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### I went over Chinnery's articles (Am J Hum Gen, Lancet) and I didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find any clear statement that hyperproliferation must precede COX
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negativity.  Where do you think he says that it does?
</em><br>
<p>Right, that's part of the problem, his model ineluctably predicts that
<br>
but he doesn't properly take it on board.  The driving force that allows
<br>
mutants to take over is an acceleration of mitochondrial replication
<br>
when there are too few working mitochondria, with the mutant mitochondria
<br>
playing no part -- effectively they are just accumulating (or fluctuating)
<br>
detritus.  But when they do accumulate, as a result of drift, the total
<br>
mitochondrial number increases to compensate, keeping the number of wild
<br>
type mitochondria optimal.  This only breaks down when the mitochondrial
<br>
number reaches &quot;alpha&quot; times the optimal wild-type.  So we should see hyperproliferation before the cell loses COX activity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, hyperproliferation may well be triggered by COX negativity.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely -- it almost certainly is.  But of course then it wil not
<br>
precede COX negativity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if indeed the mutated genome has a selective advantage, then cells with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more mt genomes would be at a higher risk of suffering a mutation (this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk goes up as a simple function of the number of genomes), and once a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single mutation is present, such cell would very quickly shift to 100%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutated genomes, as a result of selection.
</em><br>
<p>Right -- other things being equal.  But they aren't equal (see below).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; very large cells, like the ovum, and the syncytial muscle fiber, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 000 mtDNA's, and very small or quiescent cells, like chondrocytes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with only 1000 to 5000 mtDNA's, would differ in the accumulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations by an order of magnitude or more. Is it indeed the case?
</em><br>
<p>Not really, because the rate of accumulation is also affected by many
<br>
other things.  The foremost is the mutation rate, which is probably
<br>
very affected by the respiration rate -- so in fact, oocytes shouldn't
<br>
get much mutant mtDNA because they are so quiescent.  A second is the
<br>
ability for cells to die and be replaced once they become COX-negative;
<br>
this almost certainly happens, so it's not easy to do your comparison
<br>
except across postmitotic, rather apoptotis-resistant cells.  Muscle
<br>
fibres are a bit strange because the mitochondria are not very mobile,
<br>
but the COX-negativity does spread slowly along the fibre.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chinnery was able to get simulation results consistent with experimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations even without stem mitochondria.
</em><br>
<p>Nope -- only to the superficial extent that he analysed his simulation.
<br>
He found parameters that gave a realistic number of COX-negative cells
<br>
in a lifetime, but he forgot to look at how many cells were highly
<br>
heteroplasmic (had lots of wild-type and lots of mutant).  There are
<br>
far more of these than there are COX-negative cells -- but in real life,
<br>
including in (eg) Brierley et al, a paper from Turnbull's group that he
<br>
actually cites to the contrary!, we see many more totally or virtually
<br>
homoplasmic mutant cells than highly heteroplasmic ones.  Ah yes, as
<br>
you note:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Chinnery's model indicates that the number of cells with 50% mutated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genomes will be actually pretty low, on the order of a few percent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aged humans
</em><br>
<p>A few percent is actually a lot higher than the number of 100% mutant
<br>
cells seen in real life in any tissue except the substantia nigra and
<br>
one or two similarly stressed brain regions.  There it's 10%; in the
<br>
skeletal or cardiac muscle it's down around 0.1%.
