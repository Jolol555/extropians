A report out today:

Spread of HIV Strain Began in 1940, Spurred by War
<br>
<p><p><p>NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Strains of HIV (news - web sites) largely
<br>
limited to West Africa appear to have first infected humans in the 1940s,
<br>
and the current epidemic involving these strains may have originated between
<br>
1955 and 1970 as a result of war, an international group of researchers said
<br>
Monday.
<br>
<p>What this tells me is a few things: AIDS is very unlike SARS, but lessons
<br>
could be drawn nonetheless. AIDS is not very communicable like SARS is. AIDS
<br>
was inevitably fatal, but the time could be from 1 -20 years before death,
<br>
SARS is 2 weeks. AIDS was around along time ago, but it took the advent of
<br>
modern travel to spread it everywhere. Comparisons to Smallpox are not
<br>
relevant as it was wiped out many years ago. 30 years ago people traveled
<br>
much less than today.
<br>
<p>Waiting and hoping for a cure or vaccine did not work for AIDS, there still
<br>
is none! Prevention and containment works! In this age of globalism a
<br>
disease can spread very quickly and even with modern biotech, a cure may not
<br>
be easy. There are many unknowns, and the knowns are pretty bad; contagious,
<br>
~15% deadly, lives on surfaces and feces....... Sounds pretty scary to me!
<br>
<p>In any case, Dr. George Poste, a biowarfare expert says that bioweapons are
<br>
~4 years out so SARS is a good way to get ready. In fact, I think more
<br>
should be done. I feel the chances of my being killed by a missile vs a
<br>
pathogen increasingly favor pathogens, yet the gov is nickle and diming the
<br>
CDC. We spend hundreds of billions on militry offensive and defensive
<br>
weapons, yet very, very little on biodefense. This is because we have been
<br>
very fortunate over the last 50 years from pathogens, but this tide may be
<br>
turning. Like with AIDS the best way to treat something is to not catch it
<br>
in the first place!

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This man is a joke and I consider him personally culpable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; millions of needless deaths.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What on Earth are you talking about? The man said 13 years ago that all
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; talk about AIDS breaking out in the heterosexual community was nonsense
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he explained exactly why with facts and figures. Time has proven him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absolutely correct. How can being right cause the death of millions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the interest of having my head ripped off since nobody has done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so recently, I'll critique both Samantha and John.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; During the late '80s and '90s the primary mode of HIV transmission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the U.S. was through unprotected sex between homosexual (primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; male) individuals.  To cite a &quot;myth&quot; of &quot;heterosexual AIDS&quot; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. is not &quot;unreasonable&quot; because the primary transmission route
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *in the U.S.* was through homosexual contacts.  However(!) the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primary transmission route outside of the U.S., esp. in Africa
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is through heterosexual contacts.  The size of the problem in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Africa currently dwarfs the problem in the U.S. (perhaps by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an order of magnitude or more).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So John and Samantha may both be right in their perspectives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on what framework/context one chooses to look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The SARS outbreak may serve to detail how we can get it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong (the China cover-up) and get it right (the Vietnam,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singapore, perhaps Toronto -- crank down fast and hard).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We will be lucky if the SARS genome turns out to be stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we can relatively quickly develop a vaccine against it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the HIV epedemic demonstrates -- we don't want to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wrong -- and that includes not taking narrow-minded views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of transmission routes that may be significantly different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in various cultures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember the *selfish genes*....
