<br>
<em>&gt; I don't think your conclusions after reading the full text in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way refute the abstract or the media hype. The media claim from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the article I cited from the Science Daily site at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030522083022.htmis">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/05/030522083022.htmis</a> is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atkins &quot;May Be As Effective And Safe As Conventional Diets.&quot; It is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that Atkins is superior to conventional diets.
</em><br>
<p>I know that's what the article said.  But the text of the study itself said,
<br>
&quot;Longer and larger studies are required to determine the long-term safety
<br>
and efficacy of low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diets.&quot;  That is,
<br>
the study did not find its own results conclusive enough to support this
<br>
claim and said better studies were needed to test this claim.  The study
<br>
also had the disclaimer that, &quot;the results of these metabolic studies should
<br>
be interpreted with caution, given the study's relatively small sample size
<br>
and one year duration.&quot;  That is, the study didn't believe some of its own
<br>
findings.  They even warned that &quot;Additional studies in which more precise
<br>
measures&quot; should be taken.  That is, they thought that more precise measures
<br>
might produce different results.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However Atkins might very well be superior. I note the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indications (from the abstract):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though the difference in weight loss between the two diets was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistically significant, the means were nevertheless very different. On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atkins people lost about 4.4% of body weight after one year, while on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conventional diet they lost only 2.5% of body weight. So then on average,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atkins dieters lost almost twice as much weight as conventional dieters at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end of one year.
</em><br>
<p>Aren't you concerned that they didn't control or monitor the food intake and
<br>
that the study itself said a lot of people weren't really following the
<br>
diet?  How can we accept these results after a year when we don't even know
<br>
what diet these people were on?
<br>
<p>Aren't you concerned that they found no correlation between ketosis and
<br>
weight loss?  They only found a correlation between calories and weight
<br>
loss.  They also found that ketosis disappeared after a couple of months on
<br>
the Atkins diet.  Further, they concluded that the macronutrient ratio of
<br>
calories had no effect.  Doesn't this refute the entire premise of the
<br>
Atkins diet?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While these results are not statistically significant, they are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noteworthy. In addition to the difference between the means, statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significance is function of 1) the standard deviations of measurements in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two groups and 2) the number of data points in the study. The greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of data points, the greater the statistical significance, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that if things continued as they were for more than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Atkins dieters would look very good relative to the conventional low-fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dieters. Unfortunately the study ended at one year.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, all of the measurements seemed to converge and get more similar
<br>
toward the end of the year.  I think this was due to people not following
<br>
the diets.  However, following the trends would make Atkins and the
<br>
conventional diet converge until there was no difference.  That is why the
<br>
conclusion of this study was that there was little difference, because they
<br>
converged so closely to make the difference insignificant.  Longer durations
<br>
would probably make the diets even more indistinguishable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I note also that healthy HDL increased more on Atkins than on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conventional diet. I don't have the actual numbers for HDL, LDL, VLDL (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any) or total cholesterol (you have the numbers from the full text, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose) but this seems also to be a result strongly in favor of Atkins.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, not.  I was disappointed that the abstract mentioned these good
<br>
numbers without mentioning all the bad or neutral numbers.  It gave the
<br>
false impression that Atkins was superior.  Yes, Healthy HDL increased more
<br>
on the Atkins diet, but so did unhealthy LDL and so did total cholesterol.
<br>
In other words, the high fat diet raised all cholesterol as conventional
<br>
wisdom would predict.  The conventional diet lowered bad unhealthy LDL and
<br>
total cholesterol while raising healthy HDL.  This is the effect I would
<br>
want; I would not want the Atkins effect of raising all cholesterol.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That said, I think Atkins is only a half-step in the right direction. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applaud the late Dr. Atkins for eliminating agricultural products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he had taken the next step: the elimination of dairy products.
</em><br>
<p>I applaud him for suggesting high protein and low carbs.  I just wish he
<br>
would have taken the next step:  the elimination of high levels of saturated
<br>
fats.
