<p>Hmmm.... Depending on the size for a blue giant it may be simpler
<br>
to simply form an MBrain around the star and simply &quot;catch&quot; all
<br>
of the matter released when it goes supernova.  At that point
<br>
the material released is likely to consist of a higher fraction
<br>
of higher mass &quot;metals&quot;.  There may be a point to allowing gravity
<br>
to do what gravity may do best (fuse separate nuclei into higher
<br>
mass nuclei).

<p><em>&gt; Dear Mrs Binary, the traditional way of starlifting parties has been to

</em><br>
<p>Actually some comments by Carl Feynman at Extro3 made me think
<br>
he had a way of hurling supercooled ships through the chromosphere
<br>
or even the corona (see:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://hermes.physics.ox.ac.uk/users/Astrophysics/research/staratmos.shtml">http://hermes.physics.ox.ac.uk/users/Astrophysics/research/staratmos.shtml</a>)
<br>
and getting them to suck up a lot of material during the process.
<br>
<p>But I think my queries to him about it were either never received
<br>
or he didn't want to respond.  :-(

<p><em>&gt; This produces a nice thick disk that can be grabbed nicely along the

<p>Not so fast there you Inlagd Sill consumer.  If you had a bunch of
<br>
neutronium around you are going to be using it for a &quot;Chronos&quot; brain
<br>
and not for star-lifting.
<br>
<p>If you had a system in which the neutronium evolved naturally
<br>
it seems likely that the process of its creation would have
<br>
converted any nearby developing civilization into burnt toast.
<br>
<p>If you brought the neutronium in from points somewhat distant
<br>
then I want to see your interstellar navigation of neutronium
<br>
license -- as that seems to me to be a pretty fancy trick
<br>
(though I have not considered the problem deeply).
