<em>&gt;&gt; The topic came up on the Mersenne Search chat group: Guys,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; why the hell are we doing this?
</em><br>
<p>I don't wish to offend anyone or lay on a big guilt trip but here goes.
<br>
<p>The idea of wasting CPU cycles on primes and searching for ET when 
<br>
there are worthy projects like <a href="http://www.find-a-drug.com/">http://www.find-a-drug.com/</a> trying 
<br>
to find cures for diseases like cancer just makes me question
<br>
how much we really care about our fellow man. 
<br>
<p>Just please think about the people you've known who have died of Cancer
<br>
and
<br>
what the odds of someone in your family dieing a horrible death before
<br>
you decide where to spend your CPU cycles.
<br>
<p>I can't think of a more worthy Extropian goal than by increasing the
<br>
average 
<br>
human lifespan by eliminating Cancer!
<br>
<p>Just remember once we cure Cancer we free up those billions for R&amp;D in
<br>
heart
<br>
disease our other number one killer!
<br>
<p>I believe I read somewhere that by curing those two diseases alone that
<br>
our 
<br>
average lifespan would jump at least 6 years.

</em><br>
<p>The topic came up on the Mersenne Search chat group: Guys,
<br>
why the hell are we doing this?
<br>
<p>There were a number of responses, of which yours truly
<br>
won the grand prize for the most creative idea, this
<br>
prize being the heartfelt (if temporary) esteem of the
<br>
group.
<br>
<p>My notion is that a long list of Mersenne primes could
<br>
be used as a gentle deterrence or a weapon of peace for
<br>
any extraterrestrial civilizations we might contact.  If
<br>
we reveal our many resources, ET might be tempted to 
<br>
come here and devour same.  
<br>
<p>But if we transmit a long list of Mersenne primes, (the 
<br>
same in any base, in any corner of the universe) we 
<br>
demonstrate that not only are we a clever species, we have 
<br>
computer resources to simply waste on foolishness.  This 
<br>
could be easily extrapolated into our having a veritable 
<br>
firehose of technology.  One would be ill advised to give 
<br>
humanity a reason to turn that firehose upon one. 
<br>
(nice doggie, niiiice doggie, while backing away slowly.)
<br>
<p>There are other reasons, such as THE MONEY!  I could put
<br>
$100k to good use, couldn't you?  Why not, it's a (nearly)
<br>
free lottery ticket.  Furthermore, if you find one, you get 
<br>
your name on a short list for all time, along with such 
<br>
names as Euler, Pervushin, Woltman and Lucas.
<br>
<p>Every time the group finds a new prime, you get to attend a
<br>
way cool math party with such luminaries as Donald Knuth and Ernst
<br>
Mayer.  One must carefully rehearse not falling 
<br>
prostrate upon the earth before them, crying plaintively
<br>
&quot;Im so unworthy! I suck!&quot;  (They don't like it when you do
<br>
that in a crowded restaurant.)
<br>
<p>I have reconnected with a lot of local math geeks either directly or
<br>
indirectly thru GIMPS.
<br>
<p>Gregory Stock made a pitch at Extro4 about the effect
<br>
of cash prizes on research.  We now have a perfect study
<br>
case.  The EFF prize turned out to have little impact
<br>
that I can tell.  The introduction of the Pentium 4
<br>
had a large impact however.
<br>
<p>It is interesting to have a quantity that continues
<br>
to double in size every 11 seconds for years.  The size
<br>
of the record largest prime doubles every 11 seconds
<br>
on average for long stretches of time (~1 million
<br>
decimal digit prime discovered on 27 Jan 1997, 2+ million
<br>
digit prime discovered 1 June 1999, 4+ million digit
<br>
prime discovered 14 November 2001.  The doubling time
<br>
is actually getting shorter, as more people join GIMPS
<br>
and CPUs get dramatically faster.  Since we are currently searching near
<br>
the 6 million digit mark, the doubling time is now under 10 seconds.
<br>
How many phenomena do you know 
<br>
that exhibit hyperexponential growth, continuously
<br>
over long periods?
<br>
<p>GIMPS reduces waste.  If your background computing
<br>
cycles are not being used by something, your computer
<br>
is sitting there 99.9% of the time saying&quot; whatdoIdo, whatdoIdo,
<br>
whatdoIdo... over and over.  If you buy a newer machine, it asks
<br>
whatdoIdo much faster.  We
<br>
should be WORKING those idle CPUs.    
<br>
<p>It pleases me to know my idle CPU cycles are being used
<br>
to advance science, even if in a kind of trivial way.
<br>
But not really *that* trivial.  We are making a map of
<br>
nature here, a universal map.  We don't know *for absolute
<br>
sure* that the abundance of primes continues to follow logarithm rule
<br>
for abundance.  How would we know if they mysteriously began to thin out
<br>
once one is way out in the kilothousand digit primes, beyond our ability
<br>
to determine primeness?  Well, the Mersenne primes have that wonderful
<br>
shortcut to determine primeness, the Lucas Lehmer algorithm, which
<br>
allows a primality test to be done millions of orders of magnitude more
<br>
quickly than without it.  In what other area do you know of that you can
<br>
even logically use the phrase &quot;millions of orders of magnitude&quot; without
<br>
any exaggeration at all? 
<br>
<p>Mersenne Primes can be used to determine if your CPU is 
<br>
running at the advertised speed, and with accuracy.  The 
<br>
GIMPS software logs whenever your computer drops a bit and 
<br>
causes a checksum error.  These checksums are performed 
<br>
every couple hours or so.  This way, if you get a checksum
<br>
that implies an error, the algorithm loses only a small
<br>
amount of processor time, going back to the last time
<br>
a reasonable checksum was found.
<br>
<p>Heres the final thought.  My friend Scott Kurowski 
<br>
volunteered his company's services (irony: it is called
<br>
Entropia.com) to organize GIMPS.  One would have to know 
<br>
Scott.  He is the kind of guy who has money magnetism.  
<br>
If he walks thru a room, currency seems to chase him, 
<br>
struggling to get into his pocket.  A generous person is 
<br>
he: at the last Mersenne party, he showed up and picked 
<br>
up the bill.  There were 14 of us present.
<br>
<p>One wonders why Scott, the ultimate businessman, would
<br>
spend money in this way.  Then it occurred to me that
<br>
GIMPS has generated a database of enormous value.  Computers dont make
<br>
mistakes often, but they do make mistakes, and the designs have bugs,
<br>
such as the famous Pentium bug.  GIMPS has been quietly collecting data
<br>
for several years now on every kind of processor and every kind of
<br>
operating system that is in the world today.  When your processor makes
<br>
a bad checksum, the result is logged.  Scott can tell you what processor
<br>
is best, Intel, AMD or Motorola.  He can tell you if any particular
<br>
operating system correlates 
<br>
with more checksum errors.  He can tell you which
<br>
combinations of processor and operating system works
<br>
best.  
<br>
<p>How much do you think this data is worth?  To Intel?  AMD? Motorola?
<br>
How about HP, Dell, Micron and Gateway?
<br>
<p>Ive been meaning to ask Scott if he planned all along
<br>
to gather this database, or if it was just a fortunate accident, an
<br>
unintended byproduct.  What do you think? 
<br>
<p>But for me, the biggest reward is being mentioned by the
<br>
highly esteemed Australian science writer Dr. Damien
<br>
Broderick, in his most intriguing and extropic book about 
<br>
the future, The Spike, on page 87.  
<br>
<p>Of course, if I win the 100 kiloclams, that would surpass
<br>
the book thing as the biggest reward, but still the cite 
<br>
is way cool.
