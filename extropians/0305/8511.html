<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Electronic%20voting">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes: Living in Florida, I can assure you that this 
<br>
is not an urban legend.  It really happened.  The police used were county 
<br>
sheriffs and republicans. 
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess this is what sounds odd to me.  Are you saying that in a 
<br>
heavily Democrat County every county nevertheless elected a county sheriff 
<br>
that was Republican?  As to individual policemen acting this way because they 
<br>
are Republican those policemen have to answer to their Sergeants, 
<br>
Lieutenants, etc., and in addition are scrutinized by poll watchers &amp; 
<br>
election judges half of which are Democrats.  Those people whether Republican 
<br>
or Democrat have a lot of clout under the law and can use it against all 
<br>
comers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My interpretation of what resulted in Florida, excepting their Supreme 
<br>
Court, is that a lot of Democrats were good and decent people that did their 
<br>
job as they saw and did that job fearlessly whether Republicans or Democrats 
<br>
were involved.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were five to seven cases in court, not counting their Supreme 
<br>
Court, all in front of judges that were known to be Democrat.  Yet the 
<br>
Republicans won every court case.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look closely at the chad counting that seemed to have stopped 
<br>
when those Democrat dominated election boards got to the point they were not 
<br>
willing to go further in &quot;finding&quot; votes for Al Gore.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the Cook County, Illinois area I know for a fact that 
<br>
Republican election officials regularly run Democrat Party Workers and 
<br>
Politicians away from the polls for election law violations.  My point is 
<br>
that even in Cook County, Illinois opposition election judges have that kind 
<br>
of clout.  Federal election law is not to be messed with and Federal 
<br>
Penitentiaries are not fun places.
<br>
