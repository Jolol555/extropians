<p>0. My personal conclusion:
<br>
<p>It really is pretty much of a &quot;Lensman&quot; or too-mega-engineering tool (maybe 
<br>
around Planetrans (ballistic intercontinental railway) level); but I could 
<br>
see the USA sparing 10 billion a year for ten years if that would actually 
<br>
pay for a workable gizmo.
<br>
<p>I will now proceed to riff further while pretending that someone were to 
<br>
actually field this thing.
<br>
<p>1. On weapons effects:
<br>
<p>What depth of concrete, or granite, or even *halite* (think: salt mine) 
<br>
hardening do you think a bunker buster can get through? Five bunker 
<br>
busters? Ten? &quot;Deep underground&quot; in bunker-buster /conventional-penetrator 
<br>
terms is on the order of ten meters of herringbone-cantilever-laid 
<br>
concrete, AFAIK (that's a Fermi number). I'd guess that CEP makes it 
<br>
unlikely that multiple hits would scale linearly (the ideal case for 
<br>
perfect targeting, all down the same &quot;chimney&quot;, as it were).
<br>
<p>Cruise missiles wth conventional warheads don't carry a whole lot of punch. 
<br>
How many were you planning on using for each of my 100 warheads, some 
<br>
fraction of which are fakes?
<br>
<p>I'm not disputing the expense, I'm not claiming cost-effectiveness, or 
<br>
indeed defending the concept in any way. Just asserting that both the 
<br>
conventional approaches you mention are more limited than you seem to be 
<br>
making them out to be. Neither one of them does the locating, as the guys 
<br>
who wrote the paper propose the neutrino beam could do. I'm not convinced 
<br>
they're right about that, anyway.
<br>
<p>2. On collateral damage:
<br>
<p>These guys use a 3% yield figure of merit for a &quot;fizzle&quot;. That sounds not- 
<br>
way-out-of-line as a guess to me, but I don't know how it scales. I'm not 
<br>
sure that doesn't count as some sort of collateral damage. SO for a bare 
<br>
sphere 20 kT nominal yield, they'd expect 0.6 kT fizzle yield.
<br>
<p>Worst-case, that 3% is far too conservative for any munitions that are 
<br>
&quot;salvage fused&quot;--configured to do their best to detonate at max yield if 
<br>
they sense shock/EMP/heat/radiation. But on the other hand, who in their 
<br>
right minds would salvage fuse a warhead *before it's even armed* and *on 
<br>
home soil*? That seems a bit too Strangelovian to me: &quot;Look at all the 
<br>
fallout you inflicted upon the world! If you hadn't been so 
<br>
imperialistically trying to impose your hegemony, none of this would have 
<br>
happened!&quot; Then again, a really independent limited-edition/one-off nuke 
<br>
might have very few safeguards and you might get a Chernobyl out of trying 
<br>
to &quot;pacify&quot; it if, say, a lab near it lost containment or burned 
<br>
&quot;collaterally&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you are using the beam against an incoming ballistic warhead (which 
<br>
actually is mentioned straight-facedly in the paper), &quot;salvage fusing&quot; has 
<br>
been a part of the cost of doing ABM business for a long while now.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the gedanken,
<br>
<p>MMB
