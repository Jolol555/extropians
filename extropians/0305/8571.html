<em>&gt;Adding a technology axis maps us into the liberty sphere really well.

<em>&gt;Perhaps we need a new Worlds Shortest Political Quiz?
</em><br>
<p>It's David Nolan's &quot;Worlds Smallest Political Quiz&quot; (1969).  It doesn't 
<br>
work well because its 10 questions require quantifying by people who take 
<br>
the test.
<br>
<p>At ExI, we are working on a &quot;Worlds Smallest Futurist Quiz, and I'm working 
<br>
on a version for my talk at the TransVision Conference.  For this, I was 
<br>
planning on solicitating Ander's keen mind :-)  I think you would be good 
<br>
at critiquing it Mike, but you tend to push your own political views too 
<br>
strongly for a unbiased quiz.  I think the key here is to help people 
<br>
understand their beliefs, not to design a quiz that causes them to vote one 
<br>
way or another.  Delicate balance, but it would not hold up as a good 
<br>
design if it intentionally slants one way or there other.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure just how to does this for a futurists' quiz, but at least I've 
<br>
got the first 2 questions.  The night before last, my mother, Max and I 
<br>
tossed around a few ideas and this was provoking because of the differences 
<br>
between an 85 year old and baby boomers.  We focused on biotechnological 
<br>
questions and my mother proved to be extropic in her thinking here.  But 
<br>
not everywhere!  I think that to design a balanced quiz, it would require 
<br>
either a person who is very sharp or a team of people from diverse 
<br>
backgrounds to test the questions.  I'm just a beginner with this sort of 
<br>
thing, so I don't have enough experience to know right now. With a futurist 
<br>
quiz, the design issue would be to help people rate their own ability to 
<br>
accept change and to adjust to change.  Its pretty obvious that not 
<br>
everyone is futurist thinking in all areas.  Politics and religion are 
<br>
probably the most backward areas for futurism.
<br>
<p>Inasmuch, one key design element is to steer clear of positioning tactics. 
<br>
There are a lot of spin-quizes based on Nolan's quiz and a few pretty funny 
<br>
parodies for a socialist design using Nolan's prototype.
