<p>Below is an abstract describing some promising research on cattle diets. 
<br>
<p>The &quot;n-3&quot; designation in this abstract refers to omega 3 oils and &quot;n-6&quot;
<br>
refers to omega 6 oils. In this study, supplementing the cattle diet with
<br>
high omega 3 linseed and fish oil had a dramatic effect on the balance of
<br>
omega 6 to 3 in cattle muscle. 
<br>
<p>We evolved on a ratio of omega 6 to 3 of about 2:1. Some even estimate the
<br>
ratio to be 1:1. The modern American diet has swung way out of balance, with
<br>
a ratio of about 10:1. Australia is even more out of balance with a ratio of
<br>
about 12:1. 
<br>
<p>This imbalance happened largely because we started feeding ourselves and our
<br>
livestock high omega 6/3 ratio grains. Grains contain little fat, but what
<br>
fat they do contain is weighted extremely in favor of omega 6 vs 3 when
<br>
compared to the natural plant foods upon which humans and animals evolved.
<br>
<p>We feed high-carb, high-omega 6/3 ratio grains to our farm animals because
<br>
it works well for purposes of fattening them up for slaughter. We feed
<br>
ourselves more of the same and then we wonder why we're as fat as our farm
<br>
animals.

<br>
Enhancing the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of beef is
<br>
important in view of the generally saturated nature of fatty acids in
<br>
ruminant meats and the negative effect this can have on human health. This
<br>
study examined the effects of different sources of dietary n-3 PUFA on the
<br>
performance of steers and the fatty acid composition of m. longissimus
<br>
thoracis muscle and associated subcutaneous adipose tissue. Animals were fed
<br>
ad libitum on grass silage plus one of four concentrates (60:40
<br>
forage:concentrate on a DM basis) containing differing sources of lipid:
<br>
Megalac (16:0), lightly bruised whole linseed (18:3n-3), fish oil (20:5n-3
<br>
and 22:6n-3) and a mixture of linseed and fish oil (1:1, on an oil basis).
<br>
Diets were formulated so that total dietary oil intake was 6 %,
<br>
approximately half of which was from the experimental test oil. Linseed
<br>
feeding not only increased the levels of 18:3n-3 in muscle phospholipid from
<br>
9.5 to 19 mg/100 g muscle but also enhanced the synthesis of 20:5n-3, the
<br>
level of which increased from 10 to 15 mg/100 g muscle. Linseed also
<br>
increased the proportion of 18:3n-3 in muscle neutral lipid and in adipose
<br>
tissue lipids by a factor of 1.64 and 1.75 respectively. Fish oil feeding
<br>
doubled the proportion of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 in muscle phospholipids. The
<br>
proportion of 18:1 trans in muscle neutral lipid was higher on the n-3 PUFA
<br>
diets than the control diet, 0.04 and 0.02 respectively. Despite the implied
<br>
modification to rumen metabolism, lipid source did not affect feed intake,
<br>
growth rate, cold carcass weight or carcass fatness, but carcass
<br>
conformation score was higher on fish oil treatments (P &lt; 0.05). However,
<br>
total muscle fatty acid content was not different between treatments and
<br>
ranged from 3.5-4.3 % of tissue weight. The increase in n-3 PUFA in the meat
<br>
produced by feeding linseed or fish oil lowered the n-6:n-3 ratio but had
<br>
little effect on the P:S ratio.
