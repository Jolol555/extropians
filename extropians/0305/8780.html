</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse) to someone who believes in the supremacy of average happiness.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'd suggest that a rational altruist must be truth-seeking, since
<br>
his goal to maximize the happiness of the world requires knowing the
<br>
truth about what states of the world achieve that goal.
<br>
<p>As for honesty, this points out a problem in the formulation of game
<br>
theory.  We assume that both sides have access to the payoff matrix,
<br>
which accurately depicts the utility for each person.  This is actually
<br>
an unreasonably strong assumption, since how could one know the utility
<br>
of an outcome for someone else?
<br>
<p>And I think it is important in the definition of the Prisoner's Dilemma
<br>
that you do know what the payoffs are for the other guy.  Just seeing
<br>
and knowing your own payoffs is not enough to create the dilemma.
<br>
<p>So it does seem that in the context of PD analysis, we do have to assume
<br>
a certain level of honesty, at least to the point that each party has true
<br>
knowledge of the worth to the other side of the various outcomes.
<br>
<p>Without analyzing it in detail, I think this level of honesty,
<br>
in conjunction with the usual game theory assumption of rationality,
<br>
would be enough to imply the result that the two parties can't disagree.
<br>
Basically the argument is the same, that since you both have the same
<br>
goals and (arguably) the same priors, the fact that the other party judges
<br>
an outcome differently than you must make you no more likely to believe
<br>
your own estimation than his.  Since the game theory matrix makes the
<br>
estimated utilities for each outcome common knowledge, the two estimates
<br>
must be equal, for each outcome.
