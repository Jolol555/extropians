</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; .. you might try asking the survey question this way: do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; favor giving planetwide control to an organization composed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of delegates most of whom were appointed by governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that do not represent the interests of their people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Favor it in relation to what though? The prospect of Libya 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;championing&quot; human rights certainly doesn't appeal to me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personally. But at this stage in civilization we (humanity) don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get to do things in fine brush strokes. Its crude broad brush 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strokes and ugly compromises only. But simply because there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are no all pleasant choices in how to organise or establish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; international law doesn't mean we can't find optimals amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the unpleasant choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't disagree with that (mainly because it isn't really saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything).
</em><br>
<p>Its not saying much I admit. The point I had in mind was that
<br>
people forget that civilization and the formulation of better forms
<br>
of societies are ongoing processes. The &quot;model&quot; I personally 
<br>
carry around is not of some fall from a previous state of grace in
<br>
some garden of Eden but of a slow, tough, crawling out and up
<br>
from the primordial slime.
<br>
<p>But even in 2003 when much more of the population is secular
<br>
and scientifically literate I think many people slip back into the
<br>
seductive notion that things were once much better than this for
<br>
people generally. I think there never were. Civilization is a 
<br>
bootstrapping process. I think we (&quot;our generation&quot;) is now at 
<br>
a point when the relationships between nation states and the
<br>
laws or otherwise that exist between them are very much up for
<br>
grabs. 
<br>
<p>I think the illusions of more international law and order existing 
<br>
than many people thought are being revealed now as illusions. 
<br>
<p>It is pretty tough to increment civilization on illusions (perhaps
<br>
like the UN) so some disillusionment now, may be in the longer
<br>
term a good thing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To me, the choice of no international body, and a set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decentralized, individual, sovereign states is clearly superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to  the choice repesented by the UN.
</em><br>
<p>If one happens to be an American citizen, that could well be
<br>
the rational choice for the short term. But in the long term
<br>
I don't think fortess America can work any better than fortress
<br>
Rome, or Athens etc. 
<br>
<p>I think American's want to trade, they want to travel. So some
<br>
international laws do seem to be necessary and in the interests
<br>
of Americans.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you want to propose  another choice, you'll have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince me that it's better than that.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have the answers. I wish I did. I have a suspicion that
<br>
we may now have to ditch the illusion that was the UN to come
<br>
up with a sort of UN version 3 (in American's interests too).
<br>
What bothers me is how long that is likely to take. 
<br>
<p>I was going to try to refrain from talking about politics. But your 
<br>
reply came through before I posted to Ron. 
<br>
<p>I don't like not talking about stuff that I think is genuinely
<br>
important (face to face I consider sex, politics and religion all fine
<br>
conversational fare and worth talking about - not necessarily in
<br>
that order) and I'm willing to be shown to be mistaken or wrong
<br>
but sometimes on a list it seems I have to surrender to the
<br>
limits of the medium. The perfectly natural high emotions and 
<br>
strong feelings on some topics seems to drown out the attempts
<br>
at communication altogether. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Bret
