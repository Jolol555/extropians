I finally found a transcript of the Wayne LaPierre interview from
<br>
Friday night. Rather than breaking segments of a large program up into
<br>
multiple transcripts as they usually do, they bulked the whole program
<br>
into one transcript, then didn't mention the LaPierre segment in the
<br>
contents list at the top of the page or on the list of the days
<br>
programming. This is a more insidious form of censorship, a
<br>
misdirection or 'hide in plain sight' technique of propganda.
<br>
<p>It was from the &quot;Wolf Blitzer Presents&quot; show, hosted that evening by
<br>
Kyra Phillips. Anyway, here it is:
<br>
<p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Viewers are speaking out on a segment we aired yesterday
<br>
concerning the federal ban on assault weapons. The 1994 ban could
<br>
expire in September 2004 if Congress doesn't extend it. 
<br>
<p><p>Now here's a sampling of your viewer e-mail. 
<br>
<p><p>From David in Calhoun, Georgia: &quot;It's not the weapon which has the
<br>
knockdown power, it's the ammo.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>From Andrei in Washington, D.C.: &quot;You made no mention that many
<br>
Americans legally own fully automatic weapons with a special permit.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>And from Jim in San Francisco: &quot;Your sources implied that assault
<br>
weapons are more powerful than currently legal guns, but it appeared
<br>
that the only functional distinction was in the size of the clip.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>We want to thank our viewers for their feedback and for viewers who
<br>
didn't watch yesterday, we asked the Broward County, Florida's
<br>
sheriff's office for a demonstration of the assault weapon. The deputy
<br>
fired an illegal weapon at cinder blocks and bulletproof vests and you
<br>
can see the impact here. And then the deputy fired a legal weapon, but
<br>
the deputy did not fire at the cinder blocks so you could not see
<br>
similar damage the ammunition would have caused.
<br>
<p><p>Also yesterday on the program former L.A. police chief, Bernard Parks,
<br>
who's in favor of keeping assault weapons illegal, gave his opinion. 
<br>
<p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
<br>
<p><p>BERNARD PARKS, FORMER L.A. POLICE CHIEF: There's only one reason for it
<br>
and you cannot hunt with it. It's only one reason and that is that it
<br>
kills people. It's a military weapon. It should be kept in a military
<br>
arsenal and out of the domestic society. 
<br>
<p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Now we give you the other side from the executive vice
<br>
president of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre 
<br>
<p><p>Wayne, thanks for being with us. 
<br>
<p><p>WAYNE LAPIERRE, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, NRA: Hi, Kyra. Good to be
<br>
with you. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, if the ban on assault weapons expires, what kind of
<br>
weapons would be legal? 
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: Kyra, let me say this to start: I'm glad you ran the story
<br>
because apparently the only difference between &quot;The New York Times&quot; and
<br>
CNN is that when a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; fakes a story,
<br>
he's fired, and at CNN he's not. 
<br>
<p><p>Your bureau chief, John Zarrella, deliberately faked the story
<br>
yesterday and intending to show that the performance characteristics of
<br>
banned firearms on the list are somehow different from the performance
<br>
characteristics of firearms not on the banned list. He was -- he was
<br>
implying that these were machine guns or fully automatic guns. That's
<br>
not true. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Mr. LaPierre, I have to stop you there. No one fakes stories
<br>
at CNN and John Zarrella definitely did not fake a story at CNN. You're
<br>
very off base. I'm going to let you say your opinion, and let's have a
<br>
conversation, but don't accuse our reporter of faking any stories, sir.
<br>
<p><p><p>LAPIERRE: Let me say it again. In front of the whole country, your
<br>
reporter faked that story yesterday. It deliberately misread...
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: All right, we're going...
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: There's no way it could be true and I challenge CNN to defend
<br>
it. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, we're not going to continue this interview because our
<br>
reporter did not fake... 
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: Because you don't want the truth. The truth you don't want
<br>
out there.
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: OK, that is not true. We did not a fake a story.
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: You ought to register your -- you ought to fill out a lobby
<br>
form and register.
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Why don't we ask another question? What are the uses for an
<br>
assault weapon? Tell me what the uses are for this. 
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: Why can't you accept the truth? There is no difference, Kyra,
<br>
in the performance characteristics of the guns on the banned list and
<br>
the guns not on the banned list. They don't shoot any faster, they're
<br>
not more powerful, they're not machine guns, they don't make any bigger
<br>
holes, all which your reporter, John Zarrella, implied in that story. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Let's talk about the ammunition. Folks had problem with the
<br>
ammunition. We've heard a lot in the last 24 hours from viewers who
<br>
made the point that it's not the weapons who do the damage, it's the
<br>
ammo. OK? Can legally be bought, ammunition. Now does this do -- do
<br>
just as much damage than an illegal weapon?
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: Kyra, they all fire the same ammunition. Why can't you accept
<br>
the truth? There is no difference in the guns on the banned list and
<br>
the guns not on the banned list. 
<br>
<p><p>Your reporter's story was deliberately misleading the viewers. Bill
<br>
Clinton deliberately misrepresented the House and the facts to the
<br>
House of Representatives in the Congress and I don't believe this House
<br>
of Representatives is going to fall and have the wool pulled over their
<br>
eyes the way what happened did in '94. 
<br>
<p><p>The truth matters. The public needs to hear the truth and the truth is
<br>
every police officer on the street knows it. There's not a dime worth
<br>
of difference between the guns on the banned list and the guns off the
<br>
banned list in terms of their performance characteristics and I
<br>
challenge CNN again to defend that story to its viewers because it's
<br>
not true. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: What do you say...
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: All day yesterday you misled the viewers. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: What do you say to the members of the law enforcement
<br>
community that we had on the air who say assault weapons don't belong
<br>
on the streets?
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: Kyra, I got calls all day yesterday from law enforcement
<br>
officers going crazy over that story you ran saying it's not true. They
<br>
were dismayed that there was a law enforcement officer on there lending
<br>
himself to it. 
<br>
<p><p>The story misrepresented the facts. What we need to do to stop crime --
<br>
every time you catch a criminal, 100 percent of the time, prosecute
<br>
him. Put him in prison. 
<br>
<p><p>We have all kinds of gun laws. Catch a violent felon with a gun, put
<br>
him in jail. Catch a violent drug dealer with a gun, put them in jail
<br>
100 percent of the time. That's what rank-and-file cops know stops
<br>
crime. But again, I challenge CNN in the headquarters to take an
<br>
objective look at that story and defend it because it's simply not
<br>
true. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: All right. Executive vice president...
<br>
<p><p>LAPIERRE: &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter was fired, John Zarrella ought
<br>
to be fired. 
<br>
<p><p>PHILLIPS: Executive vice president of the National Rifle Association,
<br>
Wayne LaPierre, that's why we are interviewing you today and that's why
<br>
we're addressing this to show both sides of that story. 
<br>
<p><p>And we all stick by John Zarrella and how credible of a reporter he is.
<br>
<p><p><p>Thank you for your time, sir.
