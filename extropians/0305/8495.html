<p>If you believe this then there are large segments of the human
<br>
population whose points of view you do not understand well.
<br>
Muslim fundamentalists, Christians, esp. of the &quot;born again&quot;
<br>
variety, and much of the Presidential Bioethics Committee come
<br>
immediately to mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think I accept the theses that in order for an intelligent desperate

</em><br>
<p>No!  That is one of the key points to understand about technologies
<br>
becoming smaller, cheaper and more available.
<br>
<p>Remember how long it took to catch the Unabomber and notice how
<br>
we still seem to be pretty clueless about the source of the anthrax
<br>
spread about a couple of years ago.  One of the important things
<br>
to recognize about bioterrorism is that one can personally have
<br>
long since departed the scene when people start dropping like flies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fortunately probably more people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of acquiring the destructive knowledge base but far fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will adopt the perspective that their own lives are so worth the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of making their point.
</em><br>
<p>One should remember that soviet workers in the bioarms industry
<br>
were generally vaccinated against the weapons they were working on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Oklahoma bombings&quot; as incidents are one thing, are we going to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them as a sort of syndrome? What if anything is the defence?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know -- there seem to be two very different hazards.
<br>
The first is where an individual wants to make a statement
<br>
about their hatred or political philosophy (the suicide bombings
<br>
in the Mid-East) come to mind.  The second is where an individual
<br>
wants to simply eliminate persons, a group, a nationality, etc.
<br>
The second group would have to do nothing more than infect the
<br>
conference room the night before an Extro Conf. or get a job
<br>
preparing the food for a Conf. diner, etc.
<br>
<p>Robert
