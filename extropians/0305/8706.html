<p>
Since Javien indicates that this topic has got 36+ responses,
<br>
I'll toss in my 2 cents.
<br>
<p>Of course the comments by Anders and Eliezer are noteworthy (I can't quite
<br>
isolate them from the merged messages, but then again when are they not
<br>
noteworthy?) but the recent comments by Ramez seem to add some significant
<br>
viewpoint/insights based on an examination of sources that they may not
<br>
have viewed.
<br>
<p>This is not in any way to side with any proponents in the discussion
<br>
(which I will admit I have not followed closely) but to simply cite
<br>
the points that I have seen that seem to carry some throw weight.
<br>
<p>This message is my brief way of noting that &quot;hmmmm... these are some
<br>
things that one needs to *seriously* think about.&quot;  And serious thinking
<br>
may require reading many papers (and books) -- so comments without
<br>
demonstrating one has done so may require looking at such with
<br>
one raised eyebrow.
<br>
<p>In this topic (as in many other discussions) one can talk but
<br>
the question becomes whether one has done the walking
<br>
that leads to and can support it.  (i.e. the
<br>
&quot;walk the talk&quot; paradigm.)
<br>
