<p>
&nbsp;Huemer's use of irrationality to refer to &quot;instrumentally rational but
<br>
not epistemically rational&quot; is really confusing, since colloquial usage
<br>
or &quot;irrationality&quot; seems to include some element of instrumental irrationality.
<br>
(Huemer's use is probably a specialized use peculiar to economists).
<br>
Robin's paper which phrases it in terms of truth-seeking provides a less
<br>
confusing sound-bite, although that's still no substitute for a detailed
<br>
explanation.
<br>
&nbsp;This focus on irrationality creates an unnecessary dilemna (&quot;Should you
<br>
accuse other people of irrationality&quot;?). My answer is no, one should
<br>
accuse people of being overconfident in their opinions (a phenomenon
<br>
which is somewhat well known to be as normal a human failing as eating
<br>
too much sugar), and of having their opinions biased by their self interest
<br>
(which people ought to realize is a normal human failing once essays such
<br>
as Huemer's have been adequately publicized).
