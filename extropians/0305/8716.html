</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, of course there is evidence, at least for a move in that direction. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example the cave paintings at Lascaux, France, show a painstaking attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to detail. The paintings were likely meant to seen by other HG'ers as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories about real life events experienced or witnessed by the painters, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surely those painters had some concept of the communication of numbers as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they told their stories in their paintings.
</em><br>
<p>What stories? As <a href="http://www.historian.net/hxwrite.htm">http://www.historian.net/hxwrite.htm</a> puts it about some
<br>
cave paintings: &quot;As long ago as 25,000-30,000 years BP, humans were
<br>
painting pictures on cave walls.  Whether these pictures were telling a
<br>
&quot;story&quot; or represented some type of &quot;spirit house&quot; or ritual exercise is
<br>
not known.&quot; I think that represent the consensus of researchers; I have
<br>
myself not seen any old cave paintings that contain any clear story
<br>
element (maybe there is something in Scott McCloud's _Understanding
<br>
Comics_, but I don't have it within reach). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see no fundamental distinction between cave paintings of wild animals and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more abstract symbols representing a number of animals used later during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neolithic and modern times. 
</em><br>
<p>I think linguists would disagree with you, or rather complicate things. 
<br>
There is no syntax for the animal pictures; they might represent things
<br>
and sometimes situations, but their relationships doesn't link together 
<br>
in any reliable way. Linguists put special emphasis on the difference 
<br>
between finite communication systems and open ended language systems. 
<br>
Cave paintings seem unable to express ideas beyond what they depict.
<br>
<p>Of course, we might not know the context. Maybe a bull really was the
<br>
letter 'A', a hunter was an ideogram of 'man' and a negative picture of
<br>
a hand represented the concept of divine foresight, but it does not seem
<br>
likely. As Diamond pointed out, invention of writing is hard and has
<br>
happened only a few times, but once it is done it is easily copied and
<br>
spreads rapidly. The known rapid spread of written languages from a few
<br>
places of origen doesn't seem to fit a world where proto-writing already
<br>
existed but rather a world where it was a quantum jump.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is true of course that the *degree* of abstraction increased as the need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for more abstract abbreviations became greater, as during early commerce,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hash marks are a lot easier to draw than horses) and the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulate those symbols also grew (early math) but I think it is a mistake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think something fundamentally new happened to human mental capacity at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the advent of agriculture. I think it was a difference only of degree. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real breakthrough to symbolic thinking took place at least some 30,000+
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years earlier.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. And many ritual symbols found in the cave paintings likely led to
<br>
writing. But my point is that writing like other technologies will not
<br>
be likely to flourish outside certain conditions. Agriculture did not
<br>
make people smarter, but it produced a socioeconomic situation where
<br>
writing was useful in many ways, rather than something only possibly the
<br>
tribal shaman sometimes would use. Note that the spread of writing
<br>
systems worldwide occured to agricultural societies; to my knowledge no
<br>
hunter-gatherer societies did use writing until very recently, if at
<br>
all.
