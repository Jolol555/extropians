</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You seem to know much more about gun law than I do so let me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask a question of you.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I keep hearing about a division between &quot;military&quot; weapons&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;sport weapons.&quot;  Some seem to try to convince us that it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all right to have sport weapons but not military weapons.  You have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just quoted Senator Feinstein making that distinction.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the distinction between 'sporting use' and 'military use' was
<br>
first defined by the Nazi government in its amended Reichsgeletsblatt
<br>
in the 1930's. They essentially used it to keep fully automatic weapons
<br>
and grenade launchers out of the hands of the populace, at least until
<br>
the allies were marching on Berlin, when Hitler was overjoyed at
<br>
supplying the man on the street with his own rifle and anti-tank
<br>
weapon.
<br>
<p>Senator Dodd of Connecticutt (father of current Senator Dodd) was a
<br>
Nuremburg prosecutor who obtained a personal copy of the
<br>
Reichsgeletsblatt while in Germany during the Nuremburg Trials. In the
<br>
late 1960's, when the assasinations of Kennedy, Kennedy, and King as
<br>
well as a lot of anti-war and hippie revolutionary violence was
<br>
occuring, Senator Dodd was chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Youth
<br>
Violence, charged with formulating laws to deal with the problem of
<br>
increasing violent crime. Senator Dodd trotted out his personal copy of
<br>
the Reichsgeletsblatt and had the Legsilative Research Service
<br>
translate it into english and define areas which would need changes due
<br>
to differences in German and US legal systems.
<br>
<p>This became the rough draft of a bill that eventually became the Gun
<br>
Control Act of 1968. The only significant changes were the removal of a
<br>
nationwide gun registration system. Everything else was lifted entirely
<br>
from this Nazi era statute, including the litmus test of 'sporting use'
<br>
to define legal firearms and ammunition. (this historical information
<br>
was investigated and documented by Jews For the Protection of Firearms
<br>
Ownership).
<br>
<p>Since machine guns were already regulated under the 1934 tax law, they
<br>
were left alone. Grenade launchers, bazookas, and any rifled arm
<br>
greater than .50 caliber was judged to be 'military weapons' and
<br>
classified as 'destructive devices', which you must obtain a DD license
<br>
to obtain. Armor piercing and explosive ammunition were also similarly
<br>
restricted, and until the late 1970s, you had to fill out a form and
<br>
present an ID in order to buy ammunition. The ammo restrictions were
<br>
lifted then because it was found that no crimes were prevented or
<br>
solved by the ammo documentation system, and the cost of the paperwork
<br>
was skyrocketing. The feds needed at one point three warehouses to
<br>
store all the submitted ammo purchase forms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        That distinction and the conclusion that we should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permitted sports weapons and denied military weapons to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; height of silliness and perhaps ignorance.
</em><br>
<p>Especially considering that the purpose of the 2nd Amendment is to
<br>
ensure an armed populace capable of dealing not only with foreign
<br>
invaders, but tyrannical domestic government that is unresponsive to
<br>
the people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        As I understand our Constitution, our right to own weapons is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based at least in part on our need to form a militia.  Is Senator 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feinstein suggesting that if we are called, with our weapon, to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serve in our local militia that we should show up with our trusty 22
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caliber target rifle to face hostile troops armed with the latest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons that military science can offer.  Is she being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silly?  If I have to serve I want to own the best military weapon and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ammunition my wallet can afford.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Mike, have I got that right or am I missing something.
</em><br>
<p>Youve got it. They insist we only posess sporting firearms, yet insist
<br>
that the 2nd is only for providing for a militia, which would depend on
<br>
military firearms.
<br>
<p>It is a prescription for the sort of police state that socialist
<br>
revolutionaries require to stage a revolution effectively. By
<br>
segregating ownership of effective weapon ownership (the military) from
<br>
non-effective weapon ownership (civilian pop-guns), they ensure that
<br>
the populace is never able to effectively object to the imposition of
<br>
socialist tyranny.
