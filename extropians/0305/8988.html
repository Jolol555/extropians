<em>&gt;&gt; For the full essay, see <a href="http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/irrationality.htm">http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/irrationality.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, indeedy.  I will agree that it is quite a good essay, well-written
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and easy to read, and well-informed on most points.  However, the author
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in my opinion makes several errors.  One is that he fails to appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how Pan Critical Rationalism explains learning and the retention of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hypothesis (which is to say, he fails to acknowledge how conjectures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really die).
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I'll address this fallacy in a later post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Two, he doesn't address some cases where it seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious that values determine some political stances, and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find the simplest explanation for some of his examples, like, duh, look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the ambiguity of certain words. 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Huemer probably does misjudge the frequency with which people disagree
<br>
on the meaning of words. If you had bothered to read Robin's more rigorous
<br>
version of the argument, it would be even more obvious than it should be
<br>
from reading Huemer's version that this is irrelevant. If, for example,
<br>
leftists use &quot;poverty&quot; to mean inequality and rightists use it to mean
<br>
wealth levels that fail to meet some absolute threshold, epistemically
<br>
rational people would figure this out and rephrase their statements to
<br>
make clear which meaning of poverty they are using before developing any
<br>
persistent pattern of disagreement with other epistemically rational people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   What underlying thesis supports the views that (a) capitalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   is unjust, (b) abortion is permissible, (c) capital punishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   is bad, and (d) affirmative action is just?  Here I need only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   claim that these beliefs are *correlated*...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, I can think of two (2) value differences that explain these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;political differences!  One is that liberals rate inequality as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much more damaging and unfair than do conservatives, and secondly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many libertarians and conservatives (though not I, incidentally)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consider it morally *unjust* for rich people's money or hard-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;working people's money to be taken from them by force for the sake
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the poor.  (I myself happen merely to think that it doesn't work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out at all well to do so, even though I am a libertarian-conservative.)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The claim that those two value differences explain those four beliefs
<br>
correlations sounds wildly implausible to me. And if true, it would
<br>
merely change the issue to a factual dispute (over which epistemically
<br>
rational people wouldn't persistently disagree) over something like this:
<br>
people (or some other set of beings whose welfare the speaker values)
<br>
will be happier (or some other measure of utility will be increased) if
<br>
beliefs X and Y about property rights and equality are adopted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now consider his flawed treatment of the capital punishment question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He thinks that it comes down to a factual dispute, and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;various partisan proponents disagree over the facts about capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt;punishment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Those who support capital punishment are much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   likely to believe that it has a deterrent effect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   and that few innocent people have been executed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Those who oppose capital punishment tend to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   that it does not have a deterrent effect, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   many innocent people have been executed.  Those are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   factual [sic] questions, and my moral values should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   not have any effect on what I think about those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   factual questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But those are not EASILY RESOLVED factual questions!  Even more
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The difficulty of resolving the factual questions has no obvious relevance
<br>
to Huemer's (and Robin's) argument.
<br>
&nbsp;I believe that capital punishment disputes could in principle be boiled
<br>
down to factual disputes, but I don't think this is easy to demonstrate,
<br>
and it isn't something that Huemer's claims depend upon.
