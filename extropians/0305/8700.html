<br>
<p>GTS,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand the theory of humor, a joke results at the point where 
<br>
reality intersects with what the comedian is saying.  In other words the 
<br>
comedian has to say something that intersects the known world.  I see all sorts of 
<br>
humor where the only intersection with reality is the name or image the 
<br>
comedian attaches to the joke.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I could take Clinton's image or name and attach a totally 
<br>
unrelated joke to that image or name.  Some would laugh at the joke but it is 
<br>
totally unfair as the joke is not something attached to him by anything but 
<br>
his name.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see way too much of that with both Clinton and Bush to the point I 
<br>
get a bit sensitive.
<br>
Ron h.
