<em>&gt; &gt; I was explaining a typical thought experiment to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acquaintance in order to convey why mass increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; occurs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, in modern treatments of Special Relativity, relativistic mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase is no longer considered to be the best way of understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>I (Lee) had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Okay, so you are approaching a solar system at speed v
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in your rocket ship, and you see a planet orbiting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; star.  You are traveling perpendicularly to the plane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the orbit of the planet.  So imagine that the planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is orbiting the star like the tip of a minute hand is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; orbiting the center of a clock on the wall, and you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; walking towards the clock straight on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now because physical processes happen in that solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system in your frame of reference more slowly than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do in the that solar system's frame, you observe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the planet is moving around its star not very fast.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact, judging from the usual mass of that kind of star,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its amazing how slowly that planet is revolving about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So using some typical formulas, you calculate the mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the star, and find it to be rather picayune.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hold on!  Special relativity predicts that your measurements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the star should make it *more* massive, not less.  Paradox!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Teachers downplay the notion of &quot;relativistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass&quot; because it leads to so many confusing situations like the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you describe.  Instead, they use the idea of &quot;relativistic momentum&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is equal to rest mass, times velocity, times the &quot;gamma&quot; parameter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2).  By sticking with momentum and energy, you don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to imagine that mass increases.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I had seen this more modern treatment in some books.
<br>
In fact, they were quick to credit Newton himself with
<br>
this insight: Newton emphasized that acceleration is
<br>
equal to the change in momentum, F = dp/dt, and it
<br>
was only a simplification of the concept (perhaps by
<br>
others) that lead to our using F = ma.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The old way took that same formula, p = v * m * gamma (where m is rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass), and grouped the last two terms to produce the &quot;relativistic mass&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which went to infinity as v approached c.  But as I said that produced a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of confusion.  Among the problems would be the question of whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sufficiently fast moving particle would become a black hole when its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;relativistic mass&quot; got high enough.  Basically anything involving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitation causes problems.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for resolving the paradox!  Now indeed I understand
<br>
the danger (evidently apparent even to Newton!) of using
<br>
mass where momentum is better.
<br>
<p>Well, at least I can hope that my &quot;paradox&quot; will be useful
<br>
for providing a concrete example of why you (and the more
<br>
modern textbooks) are right.  Would you consider this hope
<br>
to be irrational?
