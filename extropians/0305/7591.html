<br>
<em>&gt; The price of genius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isaac Newton suffered a nervous breakdown at the age of 50.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Throughout his life he was taciturn, had few friends and was often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so engrossed in his work that he forgot to eat. Albert Einstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeated sentences obsessively until he was seven years old, became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a notoriously confusing lecturer and was generally acknowledged to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a difficult person. Both men were certainly geniuses, but did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they also have something else in common? Simon Baron-Cohen has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assessed the personality traits of both men, and believes they may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have shown signs of Asperger syndrome, a form of autism...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993676">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993676</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; R.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;three key symptoms of Asperger syndrome: obsessive interests,
<br>
difficulty in social relationships, and problems communicating.&quot;
<br>
<p>One doesn't need to be a genius, on those symptoms I might get
<br>
bouts of &quot;Aspergers&quot; at least once a week. Sometime more.
<br>
<p>What relationships aren't social? Who determines whats obsessive?
<br>
If someone is astute enough to think (accurately as with Newton 
<br>
and Einstein) that they have some radical new insight into the laws
<br>
of physics why woudn't they deem such investigations worthy
<br>
of obsession. Problems communicating? Communication requires
<br>
at least one willing listener as well. Stop blazing new intellectual
<br>
trails and one stops needing to coin new jargon to mark the
<br>
route and then &quot;communication&quot; gets easier.
