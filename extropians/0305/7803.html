<p>Why do you say this? Certainly it is better to see LDL drop while HDL rises,
<br>
but I would not dismiss as meaningless an improvement in the ratio due only
<br>
to a rise in HDL.
<br>
<p>I would say that as long as total cholesterol does not rise significantly
<br>
above ~200, any increase in HDL/LDL is a good thing even if LDL does not
<br>
decline. Studies show that the risk of heart disease is inversely related to
<br>
plasma HDL. 
<br>
<p>A few days ago I posted an abstract here about the adverse effects on mood
<br>
that occur when switching from a high-fat to a low-fat diet. I did not
<br>
mention it at the time, but the statistics in that abstract show also a
<br>
significant reduction in HDL from the low-fat diet, *without* a
<br>
corresponding reduction in LDL or total cholesterol. Here is the relevant
<br>
excerpt:
<br>
<p>&quot;There was a decline in fasting concentrations of HDL-cholesterol after the
<br>
low-fat diet and a small increase in subjects consuming the medium-fat diet
<br>
(group F 4.96; df 1.12; P = 0.046), but no significant changes in
<br>
concentrations of total serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol or
<br>
triacylglycerol were observed.&quot;
<br>
<p>I remain convinced that extremely low-fat diets are unhealthy.
