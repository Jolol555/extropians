<p>From Argonne National Labs
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Hydrogen can be extracted from water using energy by electrolysis, 
<br>
thermolysis, and thermochemical cycles. The efficiency of electrolysis 
<br>
(electricity needed to produce hydrogen) is typically about 75-80%; however 
<br>
the electric power generation (thermal energy to electrical) is typically 
<br>
30-35%. Hence, the conversion of water to hydrogen via commercial 
<br>
electrolysis has an overall efficiency of only 20-25%. Thermolysis, a process 
<br>
in which water is heated sufficiently to dissociate it into hydrogen and 
<br>
oxygen, requires very high temperatures. 
<br>
<p>Themochemical cycle water-splitting processes offer the potential for making 
<br>
hydrogen at lower temperatures than thermolysis. Without the intermediate 
<br>
production of electricity, overall efficiencies of 40-50% are expected. A 
<br>
thermochemical process is a sequence of thermally driven chemical reactions 
<br>
in which water and heat are the inputs, and hydrogen and oxygen are the 
<br>
outputs. The other chemicals and reagents are recycled in a closed cycle.
<br>
<p>The two most highly developed thermochemical cycles are the sulfur-iodine and 
<br>
the calcium-bromine cycles. Both contain at least one reaction that requires 
<br>
temperatures greater than 750ºC. Process heat in that range (750-850ºC) could 
<br>
be provided by next-generation nuclear power plants...
<br>
<p>We have identified and are currently developing a copper-chlorine 
<br>
thermochemical process that yields hydrogen at a temperature of 500ºC.
<br>
* Advantages of Copper-Chlorine Thermochemical Cycle*
<br>
-Heat at required temperature could be supplied from existing power plant
<br>
&nbsp;technologies.
<br>
-Materials-of-construction and corrosion issues are more tractable at 500 oC 
<br>
than at  
<br>
&nbsp;higher temperatures. 
<br>
-The cycle uses inexpensive raw materials. 
<br>
-The energy efficiency of the process is projected to be 40-45%.      &gt;&gt;
