<br>
<p>Dear subscribers,
<br>
<p>as you will undoubtedly be aware, a rare Mercury Transit across the
<br>
solar disk will be visible next Wednesday, May 7, 2003.
<br>
<p>Together with several partner organisations and institutes, ESO has set
<br>
up a website with useful information related to this event, from where
<br>
it will also be possible to see (near-)real-time images obtained with
<br>
professional telescopes.
<br>
<p>Read more about all of this in today's press release, now available at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/pr-10-03.html">http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2003/pr-10-03.html</a>
<br>
<p>Kind regards,
<br>
<p>The ESO EPR Dept.

<br>
<p>ESO Press Release 10/03
<br>
<p>2 May 2003                                                     [ESO Logo]
<br>
<p>For immediate release
<br>

<br>
<p>A Solar Mini-Eclipse on May 7, 2003
<br>
<p>Planet Mercury Passes in Front of the Solar Disk
<br>
<p>A solar mini-eclipse! On May 7, 2003, Mercury, the innermost planet in
<br>
the solar system, willpass in front of the Sun and produce a solar
<br>
eclipse. But this event will hardly be noticed. Mercury's small disk
<br>
will indeed barely be bigger than the point of a pencil. Even the
<br>
smallest sunspots on the solar surface are as big as the Earth and
<br>
measure 10,000 km or more in diameter, while Mercury's equatorial
<br>
diameter is only 4878 km.
<br>
<p>Bathed in intense sunlight, this small, hot planet moves around the
<br>
Sun in an elliptical orbit at a mean distance of only 58 million km,
<br>
much closer to the Sun than other inner planet, Venus (108 million km)
<br>
and the Earth (150 million km).
<br>
<p>The disk of Mercury is very small and will be very difficult to see. A
<br>
powerful telescope is needed to observe this event and to show clearly
<br>
how Mercury moves across the solar disk. The disk of Mercury is indeed
<br>
only 13 arcseconds across (while the solar disk measures about 1800
<br>
arcseconds).  This corresponds to the size of a 1 EURO coin located at
<br>
the top of the Eiffel Tower as seen from the ground. Therefore,
<br>
Mercury will only block 1/20,000th of the Sun's light.
<br>
<p>Mercury Transits
<br>
<p>Passages of Mercury in front of the Sun, or  &quot;Mercury Transits&quot; in
<br>
astronomical terminology, are comparatively rare events, due to the
<br>
different orbital inclinations of the Earth and Mercury as they move
<br>
around the Sun.
<br>
<p>In order for a Mercury transit to happen, the planet must be located
<br>
directly between the Earth and the Sun and also near one of the two
<br>
points in its orbit where Mercury's orbital plane intersects that of
<br>
the Earth. We then face the dark side of Mercury - the hemisphere that
<br>
is not illuminated by the Sun - and see it as a small dark spot moving
<br>
across the bright solar disk.
<br>
<p>There are about 13 Mercury transits each century and they follow in
<br>
time intervals of approximately 13, 7, 10 and 3 years. The most recent
<br>
one took place in November 1999 and the next will be on May 7, 2003
<br>
and November 8, 2006.
<br>
<p>The next Mercury transit happens on Wednesday morning next week. It
<br>
lasts from about 7:13 hrs CEST (Central European Summer Time) until
<br>
12:32 hrs CEST (5:13 to 10:32 UT) and the contour of the small planet
<br>
as it moves across the solar disk can be seen from all places where
<br>
the Sun is above the horizon and the sky is clear. The best observing
<br>
conditions are from Europe, Africa and Asia.
<br>
<p>Observations of the transit
<br>
<p>Note, however, that this event cannot be observed with the unaided eye
<br>
- this would also be extremely dangerous because the enormous
<br>
brightness of the Sun will cause total blindness in a fraction of a
<br>
second!
<br>
<p>Observations can only be made by means of telescopes which project the
<br>
solar image onto a white screen.
<br>
<p>Public observatories, planetaria and other educational institutions
<br>
will arrange special events on this occasion. News about such
<br>
arrangements will appear in the local press.
<br>
<p>Live images on the web
<br>
<p>On this special occasion and in order to provide for everybody the
<br>
chance to watch this event, the European Southern Observatory (ESO)
<br>
and the European Association for Astronomy Education (EAAE), together
<br>
with the Institut de Mecanique Celeste et de Calcul des Ephemerides
<br>
(IMCCE) and the Observatoire de Paris in France, are providing live
<br>
images and a running commentary for all interested parties. It is also
<br>
planned to display images obtained at observatories in the Belgium,
<br>
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Spain, and possibly others. The
<br>
availability will depend on the weather situation in the various
<br>
places.
<br>
<p>Full information and many weblinks to other educational sites are
<br>
available via the special website at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eso.org/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/mt-2003/mt-intro.html">http://www.eso.org/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/mt-2003/mt-intro.html</a>
<br>
<p>On this site, extensive background information about Mercury and the
<br>
Sun can be found and, in particular, useful sheets for school students
<br>
and teachers in many languages. Live images from professional
<br>
telescopes (depending on the weather at the observing sites) will be
<br>
available on the special webpage:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eso.org/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/mt-2003/mt-display.html">http://www.eso.org/outreach/eduoff/vt-2004/mt-2003/mt-display.html</a>
<br>
<p>and it will also be possible to ask questions in  &quot;real-time&quot; to
<br>
astronomers via this page.
<br>
<p>Venus Transit on June 8, 2004
<br>
<p>The Mercury Transit of May 7 is also a kind of  &quot;general rehearsal&quot; to
<br>
the even rarer Venus Transit event on June 8, 2004. The last such
<br>
event took place in 1884, so that no living person has ever seen
<br>
one. The above mentioned organisations are also preparing for a major
<br>
public event on that occasion. Provisional information is already
<br>
available at the VT-2004 website.
