</em><br>
<p>I think I have a partial answer to that. The supraspinal
<br>
erectile control system
<br>
(<a href="http://www.ahc-net.at/uprima/ed2/ed2_4a.htm">http://www.ahc-net.at/uprima/ed2/ed2_4a.htm</a>) is on the highest
<br>
levels controlled by lateralised structures like the amygdala. 
<br>
But the medial preoptic area and even more the periaqeductal
<br>
grey matter are medial. Hence they will likely (and this is an
<br>
assumption, I would like to see some evidence) be activated if
<br>
one side of the brain gets aroused, and pass it on downwards. 
<br>
Once PAG gets active, it inhibits the the nucleus
<br>
paragigantocellularis (love that name) which seems to act as a
<br>
kind of lock on the spinal reflex systems, and the rest runs
<br>
itself. On the other hand, the lateral preoptic area seems to be 
<br>
very involved in erection during REM sleep. 
<br>
<p>However, the amobarbital method seems to cause a state
<br>
corresponding to deep sleep or even lower in the affected
<br>
hemisphere, so we might need some other regimen to bring on
<br>
dreaming. Which incidentally is usually accompanied by ascending
<br>
activations from the brainstem, which might be experienced as
<br>
very odd by the awake hemisphere.  Fascinating. 
<br>
<p>Transhumanist relevance? We need to learn how to control and 
<br>
enhance our midbrains, and allowing lateralized emotions might 
<br>
extend our emotional repertoire in a fascinating way. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the market and google form two members of the

</em><br>
<p>Evolution?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; How did the diet thread get so huge?
</em><br>
<p>Too much calories? I mean, too much carbohydrates. No, it ate 
<br>
refined sugars! Absolutely not, it was due to meat. What about 
<br>
caloric restriction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we somehow accidentally discovered a seventh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quark flavor, wont the physicists be majorly screwed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up?  Would they attempt a cover-up?  Would we call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it still-more-strange?
</em><br>
<p>The X-quark? The truth is in there (in the hadrons).
