<em>&gt;&gt; Destruction of Nuclear Bombs Using Ultra-High Energy Neutrino Beam
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Authors: Hirotaka Sugawara (Univ. of Hawaii), Hiroyuki Hagura
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (KEK), Toshiya Sanami (KEK) Comments: 19 pages, 9 figures, LaTeX2e
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We discuss the possibility of utilizing the ultra-high energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; neutrino beam (about 1000 TeV) to detect and destroy the nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bombs wherever they are and whoever possess them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would this proposal not screw up the other uses for fissionable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear material?
</em><br>
<p>FWIW, the above URL did not work for me. But a search at the front door of 
<br>
the site on Destruction AND Nuclear AND Neutrino AND Beam worked. Here's my 
<br>
review of the proposal (but not the physics--I'm not qualified).
<br>
<p>Notionally, you use the beam to create hadrons which either melt the bomb's 
<br>
&quot;pit&quot;, or ignite the surrounding explosives and produce a &quot;fizzle&quot;, or both 
<br>
(they guesstimate a monetary cost of 100 billion dollars for the beam 
<br>
machine and a power expended of 50 gigawatts for many seconds per bomb).
<br>
<p>Configurations that are not close to criticality would be unlikely to 
<br>
experience either of those effects, as described. It does follow, however 
<br>
that any fissionables, if struck for long enough by the beam, would be 
<br>
&quot;prematurely aged&quot; and in that sense &quot;screwed up&quot;--a bit like leaving your 
<br>
flashlight's spare alkaline batteries in a car whose interior gets hot 
<br>
enough to render them useless through elevated self-discharge.
<br>
<p>Their notion behind &quot;detecting&quot; rather than &quot;destroying&quot; is that a lower 
<br>
energy beam could be used to create fission products which would be 
<br>
detected remotely (from orbit? It's not specified).
<br>
<p>It seems to me that one could use such a device to remotely disable a 
<br>
nuclear reactor by forcing its core over unity and (at best) making it 
<br>
&quot;scram&quot;. Furthermore, the actual REM dose of a working device's beam would 
<br>
be substantial if you got in its way.
<br>
<p>So you could take out nuclear subs, maybe, though power or breeder reactors 
<br>
would make easier (sitting) targets. You could conceivably also degrade a 
<br>
standing inventory of yellowcake if you thought it was worth the effort 
<br>
(investment), or even slow-bake a selected human population.
<br>
<p>I swear I am not making this up: The writers promote a world government 
<br>
*and* claim that this device would not be used as a weapon because it would 
<br>
cost too much.
<br>
<p>So the entire scenario would seem to be: some centralized authority has 
<br>
control of the beam machine and its power supply, something like a GIS- 
<br>
coded map of all the authorized concentrations of fissionables, the ability 
<br>
and will to remotely probe elsewhere with the beam plus the ability to 
<br>
decode resultant fission product signatures from any place on Earth, and 
<br>
the ability and will to fry any unexepected concentrations--unless they 
<br>
just feel like frying people. Oh, heck, we have the power budgeted already, 
<br>
let's just scan the whole Earth once a year. Good training for the boys.
<br>
<p>Gee, I want *that* job. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
