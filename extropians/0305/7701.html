Here is an extremely relevant study designed specifically to compare three
<br>
diets (a paleolithic diet, an early agricultural diet, and a contemporary
<br>
low-fat diet) with respect to their effects on risk factors for heart
<br>
disease and colon cancer. The researchers found that the paleodiet, rich in
<br>
fiber from fruits and vegetables, reduced the risk factors for heart disease
<br>
and possibly also colon cancer. Most notable is that LDL (the bad form of
<br>
cholesterol) decreased 33% on the paleodiet. This was more than for either
<br>
of the alternate diets. -gts

<br>
Effect of a very-high-fiber vegetable, fruit, and nut diet on serum lipids

and colonic function.

We tested the effects of feeding a diet very high in fiber from fruit and
<br>
vegetables. The levels fed were those, which had originally inspired the
<br>
dietary fiber hypothesis related to colon cancer and heart disease
<br>
prevention and also may have been eaten early in human evolution. Ten
<br>
healthy volunteers each took 3 metabolic diets of 2 weeks duration. The
<br>
diets were: high-vegetable, fruit, and nut (very-high-fiber, 55 g/1,000
<br>
kcal); starch-based containing cereals and legumes (early agricultural
<br>
diet); or low-fat (contemporary therapeutic diet). All diets were intended
<br>
to be weight-maintaining (mean intake, 2,577 kcal/d). Compared with the
<br>
starch-based and low-fat diets, the high-fiber vegetable diet resulted in
<br>
the largest reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (33% +/-
<br>
4%, P &lt;.001) and the greatest fecal bile acid output (1.13 +/- 0.30 g/d, P
<br>
=.002), fecal bulk (906 +/- 130 g/d, P &lt;.001), and fecal short-chain fatty
<br>
acid outputs (78 +/- 13 mmol/d, P &lt;.001). Nevertheless, due to the increase
<br>
in fecal bulk, the actual concentrations of fecal bile acids were lowest on
<br>
the vegetable diet (1.2 mg/g wet weight, P =.002). Maximum lipid reductions
<br>
occurred within 1 week. Urinary mevalonic acid excretion increased (P =.036)
<br>
on the high-vegetable diet reflecting large fecal steroid losses. We
<br>
conclude that very high-vegetable fiber intakes reduce risk factors for
<br>
cardiovascular disease and possibly colon cancer. Vegetable and fruit fibers
<br>
therefore warrant further detailed investigation. [Copyright 2001 by W.B.
