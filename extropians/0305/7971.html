</em><br>
<p>I think this still has the same problem.  Each such baby universe would
<br>
go through three stages: Big Bang, galactic era, de Sitter expansion.
<br>
The last one goes on forever and every N years it spawns a new set of
<br>
observers due to random fluctuations.  So within each baby universe
<br>
the observers during the galactic era, the era which came out of the
<br>
Big Bang just like we did, are infinitely outnumbered by the obserers
<br>
who exist due to random fluctuations during the infinite, de Sitter
<br>
&quot;steady state&quot; expansion.
<br>
<p>As long as the baby universes are enough like our own to go through these
<br>
phases, we still haven't explained why we are in the brief galactic era
<br>
rather than the infinite de Sitter era.  The only possibility would be
<br>
that the baby universes have different physics than what ours appears to,
<br>
so that they wouldn't end up in a de Sitter state, and all their observers
<br>
would be in the galactic era.  But then you have to explain why we are
<br>
in one of the rare universes that does progress to de Sitter expansion.
<br>
<p>All this is assuming that physicists are right about the future expansion,
<br>
and that the authors of this paper are right that this is a state which
<br>
allows random fluctuations to form stars and planets and observers.
