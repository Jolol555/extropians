Harvey Newstrom claimed:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Non sequitur.  I never made this claim, nor do I intend to defend it.
<br>
You seem to have the situation backwards.  You are the one who posted the
<br>
climatologists' data.  The data clearly shows the increasing trend in
<br>
tornadoes.  &lt;<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif">http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif</a>&gt;  You
<br>
dispute this claim from the climatologists&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Sorry Harvey, You provided the bar-graph. Thus, one can surmise that you 
<br>
might agree with cartoonist, Tom Toles, of the Washington Post, that a recent 
<br>
increase in tornado outbreaks is due to global warming caused by human 
<br>
activity. Was this not your point? &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif">http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif</a>&quot;&gt;

<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif</A">http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/t50-98.gif</A</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>The NOAA graph (you provided)  indicates an increase in twister activity 
<br>
since 1990, not a massive increase in tornado activity, which presumably is 
<br>
caused caused by released carbon by human activities. Funny how all the coal 
<br>
and woodsmoke did not cause a similar increase in tornados in the 2 centuries 
<br>
before 1988. Coal and woodsmoke release lots of carbon, you know.
<br>
<p>Michaels stated in his NR article:
<br>
&lt;&lt;What's going on is called &quot;radar.&quot; Thanks to an awful 1953 tornado in 
<br>
Worcester, Massachusetts (far from the Oklahoma and Texas &quot;tornado alley&quot;), 
<br>
the Weather Bureau (today's National Weather Service) went on a crash program 
<br>
to develop a national network of weather radar. Spearheaded by David Atlas 
<br>
and Ted Fujita (whose &quot;F-scale&quot; rates tornado severity on a 1-5 basis, as is 
<br>
done for hurricanes), meteorologists soon learned that when the radar paints 
<br>
a thunderstorm that looks more like a comma than a blob, there's often a 
<br>
tornado buried in the curliest point.&gt;&gt;  
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Beginning in 1988, a new network began to take shape that was even better 
<br>
at detecting potential twisters. Instead of painting a picture of a 
<br>
thunderstorm, the new machines, called Doppler radars and designated as 
<br>
WSD-88s, actually measure the change in a storm's velocity by tracking the 
<br>
movement of raindrops. When those drops start to rotate, it's not long before 
<br>
there's a tornado warning. The rotation fields often develop before the comma 
<br>
shape, which means more tornado warnings. This gets people's attention, and 
<br>
saves more and more lives. Not surprisingly, the number of tornadoes 
<br>
increased again, in the 1990s, this time proportional to the number of 
<br>
WSD-88s, which now blanket the nation. By the beginning of this century, with 
<br>
the new network now in place, the number has stabilized again.&gt;&gt;    
<br>
<p>Michaels continues:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps a refresher course in high-school earth science might be in order 
<br>
here. Tornadoes occur because a portion of a normally quiescent thunderstorm 
<br>
begins to spin. That spinning is done in large part by a dip in the strong 
<br>
westerly winds (&quot;jet stream&quot; in common parlance) that sometimes penetrates 
<br>
the U.S. when thunderstorms are common. The jet stream is the result of the 
<br>
temperature contrast between the poles and the tropics. Global warming 
<br>
reduces this contrast (warming the poles much more than the tropics) and 
<br>
reduces the spin. That means fewer tornadoes, not more.Obviously, it's a lot 
<br>
hotter in June, July, and August than it is in the peak of the tornado season 
<br>
in May. So much for the hot-air-tornado link. And why are there so many 
<br>
tornadoes in Mississippi in February? Rather, the key ingredient that spins 
<br>
garden-variety thunderstorms into killer tornadoes, the jet stream, is 
<br>
missing during the hottest part of the year, having migrated north to Canada 
<br>
for the summer. Warm it up and the migration will start earlier, it will move 
<br>
further north.That may explain why the number of severe tornadoes is 
<br>
declining. They may be running out of spin, unlike stories attempting to 
<br>
relate these destructive storms to global climate change.— Patrick J.

Michaels is senior fellow in environmental studies at the <A HREF="http://www.cato.org/">Cato Institute</A> and 
<br>
author of <A HREF="http://nationalreview.com/redirect/amazon.asp?j=1882577922">The Satanic Gases</A>.    
<br>
<p>So Harvey, are you also claiming, (since you provided the NOAA graph) that 
<br>
increase in tornado's is due to global warming; or are you saying that I must 
<br>
prove that this isn't so? My argument is against the chicken-lttle approach 
<br>
that provided such misinformation that inspired that Kyoto agreement. That 
<br>
was another concordat that wasn't based on scientific evidence.
