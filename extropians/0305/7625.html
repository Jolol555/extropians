<p><em>&gt; ### Hunting is much cheaper than sterilization - from the taxpayer's point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of view, hunting has a negative price, that is, hunters are actually willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay extra to be able to hunt. If there is a conflict between two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompatible uses of land, the rational solution is to offer the uses for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auction, allowing either hunters or hikers to buy certain land use rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for some period of time (of course, the superior solution is to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state-owned land outright, but this is a different story), so that the use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the greatest economic and human value (as measured by auction income)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes dominant.
</em><br>
<p>I was talking about total costs, not just costs to taxpayers.
<br>
<p>If we were going to auction off public land to the highest yield use, we'd
<br>
have mass acres of coca fields. I have a suspicion you'd think that'd be
<br>
fine.
<br>
<p>I don't propose policy, because I am in no position to create public
<br>
policy or even affect it by any significant amount. I suspect the same is
<br>
true of you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, whereas natural predators (not being heavily armed) pick off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weak and inferior, trophy-hunting hunters pick off the largest and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; healthiest specimens, a reverse culling that is obviously detrimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the herds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### What kind of evidence would you like to offer in support of this claim?
</em><br>
<p>What evidence would you expect? I have a cousin who is a hunter and I've
<br>
never heard him exclaim, &quot;Wow, I caught a really scrawny, young, lame one
<br>
today! Me big hunter!&quot; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Tell me more. How low cost is it? Is it cheaper than the negative price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hunting? Will its proponents be willing to outbid (with their own money)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hunters? Are you talking about hormonal methods? What is their impact on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the psychology of the deer?
</em><br>
<p>If a veterinarian volunteers everything, it's free. I'm sure a hunter's
<br>
lobby could outbid them, which obviously makes the hunters right. *rolls
<br>
eyes*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, death of a sterilized animal of old age, disease, or predation, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still more shocking than having its brains shot out, even if starvation were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a problem.
</em><br>
<p>Everything dies sometime (for now). You're making a case for shooting
<br>
every animal (and human) in the head right now. 
<br>
<p>But I will admit that even nonhuman Nature is ruthless and cruel to
<br>
animals. I wish I could even suggest something to do about that, but it
<br>
pushes even my science-fiction imagination to its limit. For now, I'm
<br>
satisfied with not adding or contributing to Nature's cruelty fest as much
<br>
as feasibly possible. In the end, we may find a solution to the plight of
<br>
wild animals, probably around the same time we find the solution to the
<br>
plight we are in (which is much the same).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more than I would feel the need to remunerate child molestors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depriving them of the ability to molest children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Ah, here is the true belief at last. Hunting is evil. Hunters are evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are scum, to be wiped off the earth if possible.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm. You've moved from my statement on nonremuneration to putting words 
<br>
in my mouth like evil, scum, and wiping off the earth. 
<br>
<p>I *do* believe hunting is evil, by my definition of evil. But that doesn't
<br>
necessarily make hunters purely evil, since there is presumably more to
<br>
hunters than hunting. It may even be, as Augustine said, that evils are
<br>
imperfect goods - in this case, the motives that lead hunters to hunting
<br>
may actually be good, but just not carried out to the fullest
<br>
extent. Thoreau attributed his love of nature to hunting, a practice he
<br>
said he later outgrew and gave up. Perhaps what he really liked about
<br>
hunting was not exactly the killing of the animals, but a lot of the other
<br>
things associated with it, like being outdoors, having contact with wild
<br>
animals, testing his abilities, whatever. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You understand that this is the archetypal in-group vs. out-group trick that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulators of all kinds use to attack their enemies. You don't feel the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to treat others like human beings (i.e. no need for Rawlsian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reciprocity, no moral symmetry, no empathy) once you manage to put them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same group as child molesters. No limits now, all year hunting season on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunters.
</em><br>
<p>In real life, I don't bother hunters. But if I feel like saying what I
<br>
think, I will. People who enjoy looking at paintings and people who like
<br>
to slash them can't live together peaceably in the same world. I'm the one
<br>
who is living in the world where people who slash paintings have more
<br>
power than the people who like to look at them. I have a right to say that
<br>
I wish they would stop - stop themselves, of their own volition. And I'm
<br>
exercising that right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You see, the form of ethical reasoning that you are using, the ethics of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repugnance (&quot;makes my stomach turn&quot;), the type of thinking exhibited by Leon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kass, and by Jeremy Rifkin, is a way of answering questions which has no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place in the civilized society. If unopposed, it promises bad outcomes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all those against whom it is directed, even you, once you find yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;repugners&quot; crosshairs.
</em><br>
<p>My ethics involves a lot more than stomach-level &quot;repugnance&quot; :) But my
<br>
reaction was to your imagination that hunting is pleasant, a gut reaction 
<br>
itself, so to speak. It would take a long time to explain my ethics, more
<br>
than emails could sustain.
<br>
<p>And I just think my ethics and yours would be incommensurable. Yours would
<br>
apparently involve whoever has the most money can do what they want, and
<br>
mine would start somewhere around human happiness...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the long term, very strict limits on our freedom to force our likes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dislikes on others are indispensable for the civilized society. Giving free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rein to one's emotions cannot be accepted, and only a material analysis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events may form the basis for value-independent decisions.
</em><br>
<p>Emotions are free; there are no value-independent decisions. We are
<br>
already constrained and constraining in systemic ways that are not
<br>
necessarily dependent on our whim. For example, I am forced to accept
<br>
hunters' rights to kill wild animals I might have befriended. There is
<br>
nothing I can do about that. Limited freedom is the nature of the
<br>
universe, not just of civilization. When I use the word civilization, I
<br>
give it a kind of romantic subjective meaning of an ideal toward which we
<br>
should aspire.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Let me explain:
<br>
<em>&gt; Blowing holes in animals does not cause significant suffering (compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their usual experiences), and this is a finding of fact.
</em><br>
<p>This is preposterous. You are an animal, does blowing a hole in you cause
<br>
you no significant suffering? If you're going to try to argue that all
<br>
nonhuman animals are robots that feel no pain and don't care what happens
<br>
to themselves, you've already made a mistake, IMHO. Everything
<br>
else you build on that assumption depends on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### I do not see how a rational person could assign &quot;blame&quot; to animals, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see their killing as punishment. Deer are shot not out of spite, but as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pragmatic action, similar to spraying for mosquitoes, removing weeds, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearing stones from a road.
</em><br>
<p>But previously you argued that hunters hunted for fun, which I think is
<br>
closer to the truth. &quot;Rational wildlife management&quot; is just the
<br>
political excuse to back up the desire to have this particular kind of
<br>
fun. If this excuse was not available, another would be found.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If humans decide to halt population growth, consensually, and based on sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical principles (not some green-ish sentimentalism), well have all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beauty we need. And enough deer to shoot, too.
</em><br>
<p>To me, this is like saying, if our museum is big enough, we can burn some
<br>
of the paintings! I agree with the suggestion that we should decide how
<br>
much of the earth we are going to inhabit and how much should be left
<br>
wild, and then stick to it. But that suggestion will never be taken on,
<br>
since there will never be such a consensus. Those with the most money, the
<br>
developers, will have the final say. They will develop every square inch
<br>
of the earth, and humans will expand to fill every inch (even arctic and
<br>
undersea), unless something else stops them. Then they will no longer be
<br>
able to hunt or hike in the wild woods to observe anything. Something like
<br>
the Deathstar, a sphere of full human &quot;development&quot; (mechanical 
<br>
or nano-buildover), this is how I envision earth's future, on the present
<br>
trajectory. It'll probably be a big weapon, too.
