<br>
<p>Just curious, how many millions of acres of coca would you imagine would be

<br>
<p>I'd day, not enough to force even a single deer out of business.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't propose policy, because I am in no position to create public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy or even affect it by any significant amount. I suspect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same is true of you.
</em><br>
<p>### You suggest sterilization not as a policy, but merely as an exercise in
<br>
imagination and rhetoric, never to be the basis of your voting or lobbying?
<br>
Somehow I can hardly believe it.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Also, whereas natural predators (not being heavily armed) pick off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the weak and inferior, trophy-hunting hunters pick off the largest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and healthiest specimens, a reverse culling that is obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; detrimental to the herds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### What kind of evidence would you like to offer in support of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What evidence would you expect? I have a cousin who is a hunter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never heard him exclaim, &quot;Wow, I caught a really scrawny, young,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lame one today! Me big hunter!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>### Hearsay!
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Tell me more. How low cost is it? Is it cheaper than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; negative price of hunting? Will its proponents be willing to outbid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (with their own money) the hunters? Are you talking about hormonal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; methods? What is their impact on the psychology of the deer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a veterinarian volunteers everything, it's free. I'm sure a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunter's lobby could outbid them, which obviously makes the hunters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right. *rolls eyes*
</em><br>
<p>### If enough people are really concerned about the welfare of deer and
<br>
truly want to help them by sterilization, you will be able to gather enough
<br>
funds. Of course, it's easier to ask the local congressman to do pay for it
<br>
with other people's money, but I think I might be digressing here.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Also, death of a sterilized animal of old age, disease, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; predation, is still more shocking than having its brains shot out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even if starvation were not a problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything dies sometime (for now). You're making a case for shooting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every animal (and human) in the head right now.
</em><br>
<p>### Me an agitator for the Endloesung of Earth's living problems? That
<br>
couldn't be true!
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; more than I would feel the need to remunerate child molestors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; depriving them of the ability to molest children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Ah, here is the true belief at last. Hunting is evil. Hunters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are evil. They are scum, to be wiped off the earth if possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm. You've moved from my statement on nonremuneration to putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words in my mouth like evil, scum, and wiping off the earth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I *do* believe hunting is evil, by my definition of evil. But that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't necessarily make hunters purely evil, since there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumably more to hunters than hunting. It may even be, as Augustine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said, that evils are imperfect goods - in this case, the motives that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead hunters to hunting may actually be good, but just not carried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to the fullest extent. Thoreau attributed his love of nature to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunting, a practice he said he later outgrew and gave up. Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what he really liked about hunting was not exactly the killing of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals, but a lot of the other things associated with it, like being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outdoors, having contact with wild animals, testing his abilities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<p>### If you were to say that hunters actually are *not* like child molesters,
<br>
I could retract my assessment of your beliefs.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You understand that this is the archetypal in-group vs. out-group
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; trick that manipulators of all kinds use to attack their enemies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You don't feel the need to treat others like human beings (i.e. no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; need for Rawlsian reciprocity, no moral symmetry, no empathy) once
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you manage to put them into the same group as child molesters. No
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; limits now, all year hunting season on hunters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In real life, I don't bother hunters. But if I feel like saying what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think, I will. People who enjoy looking at paintings and people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to slash them can't live together peaceably in the same world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm the one who is living in the world where people who slash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paintings have more power than the people who like to look at them. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a right to say that I wish they would stop - stop themselves, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own volition. And I'm exercising that right.
</em><br>
<p>### Oh, of course you have this right, I'd be the last person to ever demand
<br>
that it be taken away from you. I also exercise my right to assess the
<br>
eristic content of your speech, just so it's meaning becomes quite clear.
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You see, the form of ethical reasoning that you are using, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ethics of repugnance (&quot;makes my stomach turn&quot;), the type of thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exhibited by Leon Kass, and by Jeremy Rifkin, is a way of answering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; questions which has no place in the civilized society. If unopposed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it promises bad outcomes to all those against whom it is directed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even you, once you find yourself in the &quot;repugners&quot; crosshairs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My ethics involves a lot more than stomach-level &quot;repugnance&quot; :) But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my reaction was to your imagination that hunting is pleasant, a gut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction itself, so to speak. It would take a long time to explain my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics, more than emails could sustain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I just think my ethics and yours would be incommensurable. Yours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would apparently involve whoever has the most money can do what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want, and mine would start somewhere around human happiness...
</em><br>
<p>### As in: &quot;We just voted that you can't hunt, here or everywhere. It makes
<br>
us quite happy to vote, you know.&quot;
<br>
<p>I noted before that your ethics is incommensurate with mine, but I think the
<br>
difference lies not in the superficialities of money but in the value of
<br>
freedom - this is the bedrock of my ethics, but not yours. It leads to
<br>
happiness, too.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Let me explain:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Blowing holes in animals does not cause significant suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (compared to their usual experiences), and this is a finding of fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is preposterous. You are an animal, does blowing a hole in you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause you no significant suffering? If you're going to try to argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all nonhuman animals are robots that feel no pain and don't care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what happens to themselves, you've already made a mistake, IMHO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything else you build on that assumption depends on it.
</em><br>
<p>### Blowing a hole in the brain isn't painful. Being shot in the chest with
<br>
a large caliber hunting rifle for a human is hardly painful at all in the
<br>
beginning (there are descriptions of survivors), so animals couldn't feel
<br>
much pain, either. Much less than the pain of being eaten alive by a
<br>
wildcat.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### I do not see how a rational person could assign &quot;blame&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; animals, or see their killing as punishment. Deer are shot not out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of spite, but as a pragmatic action, similar to spraying for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mosquitoes, removing weeds, and clearing stones from a road.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But previously you argued that hunters hunted for fun, which I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is closer to the truth. &quot;Rational wildlife management&quot; is just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political excuse to back up the desire to have this particular kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun. If this excuse was not available, another would be found.
</em><br>
<p>### You can have fun doing the rational thing, too.
<br>
<p>Only Puritans though anything that feels good must be bad.
<br>
<p>----------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If humans decide to halt population growth, consensually, and based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on sound ethical principles (not some green-ish sentimentalism),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; well have all the beauty we need. And enough deer to shoot, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me, this is like saying, if our museum is big enough, we can burn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the paintings!
</em><br>
<p>### But deer are fungible automatons, not irreplaceable individuals or
<br>
sentimentally important works of art.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p>I agree with the suggestion that we should
<br>
<em>&gt; decide how much of the earth we are going to inhabit and how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be left wild, and then stick to it. But that suggestion will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never be taken on, since there will never be such a consensus. Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the most money, the developers, will have the final say. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will develop every square inch of the earth, and humans will expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fill every inch (even arctic and undersea), unless something else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stops them. Then they will no longer be able to hunt or hike in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wild woods to observe anything. Something like the Deathstar, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere of full human &quot;development&quot; (mechanical or nano-buildover),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is how I envision earth's future, on the present trajectory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It'll probably be a big weapon, too.
</em><br>
<p>### The developers have only as much money as their clients are willing to
<br>
pay. If clients become rich enough to dream about unspoiled nature, they
<br>
will build it, too. It's all a question of demand and supply. If human
<br>
happiness demands the last inch to be built up, or every inch to be turned
<br>
into a forest, the market will provide. Really.
