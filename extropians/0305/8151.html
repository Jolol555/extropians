<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Conservatives don't like different things, liberals do -- by definition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So a good media is going to be a liberal media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Above, I thought that this was simply a bad joke.  But it appears that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; writer is serious.  Of all the hare-brained ways to characterize liberals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and conservatives, this takes the cake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I actually I grew up with this ambiguity.  The terms can be used to label
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular positions on the spectrum, or the more general attitudes &quot;open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change&quot; and resistant to change.  WordNet gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        adj 1: showing or characterized by broad-mindedness; &quot;a broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;               political stance&quot;; &quot;generous and broad sympathies&quot;; &quot;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;               liberal newspaper&quot;; &quot;tolerant of his opponent's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;               opinions&quot; [syn: {broad}, {tolerant}]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        adj 1: resistant to change [ant: {liberal}]
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yes, of course.  But these are entirely separate meanings
<br>
and usages of the words.  To try to link the concepts makes
<br>
about as much sense as trying to suggest that Democrats are
<br>
more in favor of democracies while Republicans prefer republics.
<br>
<p>The liberals are plenty resistant to change when they've
<br>
been running things for enough decades  ;-)  and the 
<br>
conservatives are *eager* for change in that very same case.
<br>
While it's very true that many conservatives are not &quot;broad-
<br>
minded&quot; on social issues, (American) liberals tend to be
<br>
narrow on economic issues, wishing to deny quite a few
<br>
freedoms.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) [web1913]:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Conservative \Con*serv&quot;a*tive\, n.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      1. One who, or that which, preserves from ruin, injury,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         innovation,
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I was as confused (I claim) as your friend is when I
<br>
was about 14 and thought that conservation efforts must be
<br>
good because it was semantically linked to &quot;conservative&quot;.
<br>
Of course, I was dead wrong---conservation efforts usually
<br>
go against business and corporate interests, which do tend
<br>
to be conservative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And see Communists in the Soviet Union being &quot;conservative&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. &quot;liberal&quot; free market reformers.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; on the political *spectrum*, the free market reformers
<br>
were the more conservative.  But as resists change, of course,
<br>
the Communists were more conservative.  (At that point in 
<br>
history.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, whether she's right about the media being considered liberal because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry viewpoints conservatives don't like, vs. being considered liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they don't carry conservative views, is another question.
</em><br>
<p>And here you must mean &quot;mainstream media&quot;, because both cable
<br>
news and radio carry viewpoints conservatives like.  I consider
<br>
the mainstream media to be liberal, and unforgivably so, because
<br>
of the bias of what they pass off as objective reporting.  They
<br>
do not tend---unlike Fox News---to put on shows blatantly partisan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will note again that lefties don't think mass media is leftie.
</em><br>
<p>Many must have their eyes shut---much in the way gts is saying
<br>
that viewers and promoters of Fox News think it to be balanced.
<br>
Go figure.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Thanks for the definitions.  It certainly doesn't hurt to
<br>
refresh what the words mean separate from their current concrete
<br>
political meanings.
