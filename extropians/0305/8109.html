That's why they want it to be illegal to label food to reveal whether it 
<br>
is GM  or not.  I don't know the current status of the various laws, but 
<br>
because the market forces would act against them, the conspire to 
<br>
conceal which foods have been GM, or irradiated, or etc.  (I don't feel 
<br>
that conspire is too strong a word... they act in secret in concert with 
<br>
others, and do that which if the beneficiaries weren't legislators would 
<br>
be called bribery.)  I'm not arguing whether the market reaction would 
<br>
be reasonable or not.  Sometimes, frankly, it seems to me unreasonable.  
<br>
But to conceal the information necessary to allow the market forces to 
<br>
act removes one from having &quot;market forces&quot; used legitimately in one's 
<br>
defense.  So I don't feel that it is legitimate to defend them with that 
<br>
argument.  You may well find other arguments, but the companies 
<br>
themselves have so acted as to render that argument invalid.
