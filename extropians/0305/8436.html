<p>Nope, doesn't wash.   Nice try.

</em><br>
<p>It was precisely that and I did root for its end.  So what?  I had no 
<br>
great effect on what happened after we pulled out.   Nothing I or 
<br>
others like me said was likely to have made a lot of difference 
<br>
except where US involvment actually made the problem much worse in 
<br>
the region as in our support of the Khmer Rouge.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Now clearly, by your own criteria, promoting something that leads

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nope, that is a poor characterization.  Unlike Mr. Fumento I did not 
<br>
promote myself as any sort of expert.   One who promotes themselves 
<br>
as an expert and adviser on a problem does have greater 
<br>
responsibility.   I will grant however that it was wrong of me to 
<br>
personally hold him responsible for millions of deaths.  Instead I 
<br>
simply hold him as an undependable, irresponsible and amoral 
<br>
opportunist posturing as an expert.  Such people do cause great harm.
<br>
<p><p><p>I
<br>
<em>&gt; I certainly take issue with the accuracy of your summation of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of my points, thus clearing you of any blame for the millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of deaths in Indochina.  I would like to know which points you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I won't wate my time on such.  That war is over and done with and I 
<br>
have *much* better things to do than rehash it with you.
