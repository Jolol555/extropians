<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;But somehow 15 or 20 different methods of aging the Earth and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;universe all converge. Astonishing!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know about now, but this wasn't the case a few years ago. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recall reading in New Scientist about the embarrassing problem that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculated age of many galaxies was many billions of years older than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the calculated age of the universe. Personally I became disillusioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with astrophysics etc shortly after making the acquaintance of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;astrophysicists and discovering that a large part of what we were are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taught about the nature of the universe was no more than calculated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guesswork, whose claim to validity relied on internal consistency rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than substantive evidence. But in achieving this, fudge factors are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;often thrown into the mix, such as when the calculated mass of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe disagrees with that of the observable galaxies, we posit dark
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter to make up the balance.
</em><br>
<p>When we first start investigating a field, there may be little actual data 
<br>
and many proposed models explaining that data. There is usually little 
<br>
constraint on many variables at this point and those variables can be 
<br>
adjusted in a variety of ways to make a model &quot;work&quot;. But as time goes by 
<br>
and more data is accumulated, the variables get more constrained and the 
<br>
large number of models are whittled down to just a few, or even just one. 
<br>
This is just what's happening in cosmology now. Conundrums like stars 
<br>
apparently older than the universe went away with more data.
<br>
<p>We had a nice colloquium yesterday here at UC Riverside by Ned Wright, one 
<br>
of the researchers on the WMAP team. I got invited to the after talk dinner 
<br>
and got to talk with him extensively. One of Ned's most pleasing graphs in 
<br>
his talk was the one that showed that the &quot;predictions&quot; of Modified 
<br>
Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), don't fit the data and MOND is therefore 
<br>
falsified. MOND is the alternative to dark matter which proposes that there 
<br>
is no dark matter, we simply have to modify Newtonian gravity at large 
<br>
distances to make things work. It is not really a theory as much as a 
<br>
heuristic for how you modify Newtonian gravity at different distances. I've 
<br>
considered it the worst kind of cop-out and am glad it's killed.
<br>
<p>Dark matter now has too many lines of evidence for it not to be real, not 
<br>
the least of which is the WMAP data. Ned commented that he doesn't like it 
<br>
that we don't know what 96% of the universe is made of (23% dark matter and 
<br>
73% dark energy). He would never entertain the existence of these if all 
<br>
the data didn't compel him to. But since that's what the data shows, he has 
<br>
to accept them. Finding out specifically what they are will probably be the 
<br>
next major advance in our understanding of cosmology and fundamental nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Similarly Einstein used what might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;termed a &quot;Skinner's Constant&quot;* to make his figures come out right, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to his discomfort then led to the possibility of black holes. A more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recent interpretation of Relativity showed it was possible to dispense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with both, which if it turns out correct will prove rather embarrassing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to Steven Hawking whose entire career rests on the study of objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which might turn out to be entirely imaginary. (I did hear recently that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some black holes had actually been observed, but given this was on some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;TV programme which was a Discovery Channel co-production one has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treat such claims with a large pinch of salt, since a lot of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modern science documentaries are, sadly, long on spin and short on hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facts.)
</em><br>
<p>You should look to the scientific literature. We now have evidence for the 
<br>
existence of event horizons in the characteristics of the radio signals 
<br>
coming from matter just before it falls in the black hole from the inner 
<br>
edge of accretion disks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;(* Skinners constant: the number that when added to the results you got
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gives the answer you should have got)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-Shez.
