<em>&gt; Several questions came up at the post nanoschmooze
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering gathering.  At this gathering^2, we had a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of people who could name all six flavors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quarks, could write out Bayes law, could program in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything from Fortran to Java, and yet there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some basic questions that eluded us all.
</em><br>
<p>A lot of these questions do seem to have answers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were on the same lines as the post extro-5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we pondered such things as:  if one were in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tank filled with xenon at 215 atmospheres, would one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; float?
</em><br>
<p>If &quot;one&quot; is a normal modern human outside of something
<br>
like a pressure suit, one would be crushed dead by
<br>
most
<br>
things - xenon included - at 215 atmospheres, and it
<br>
wouldn't really matter whether what was left of one's
<br>
body floated or not, at least not to the one.  Likely,
<br>
one's body would fail to remain completely coherent
<br>
afterwards, and parts of it would have more floatation
<br>
than other parts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if one injects a sedative into one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carotid artery, and one hemisphere of ones brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is asleep, and one had half an erotic dream, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would happen?
</em><br>
<p>By what measurement?  If one half of the brain were
<br>
asleep while the other remained active, and neither
<br>
could induce the other towards its state (which you
<br>
seem to be implying), see existing literature on
<br>
left/right brain imbalances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the market and google form two members of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holy trinity, what is the third?
</em><br>
<p>Who says it's a trinity?  Maybe they're two sides of
<br>
the holy coin, or perhaps it's actually a holy
<br>
N-dimensional construct of which we were only able to
<br>
perceive three vertices at once.  (And if that's the
<br>
case, perhaps different people can perceive different
<br>
third vertices.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it that about half the spam today is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who stole a bunch of money in Nigeria and they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give it to me?
</em><br>
<p>It's less than half, but that spam has the backing of
<br>
Nigeria's organized crime (to the severe irritation of
<br>
Nigeria's government, which has a certain section of
<br>
its legal code set up to outlaw that specific
<br>
practice).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has anyone ever actually fallen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that silly gag?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Many someones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the Nigerian got my name as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is trustworthy, who is it that gave it to them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want to know who considers *me* trustworthy.
</em><br>
<p>In truth, they don't.  They just got your list as an
<br>
email address.  Despite what they claim, no actual
<br>
verification of the person behind the address has
<br>
happened, not even (before the spam is sent)
<br>
verification that there is a person behind the
<br>
address.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the opposite of surreal?  Is it surphony?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps surfake?  Surimaginary?  Or just plain real?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surreal is kind of unreal, in a way, so the prefix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sur must mean negative or not or un.  So when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes a joke that offends or falls flat, could we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that person is surfunny?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Sur&quot; would seem to be a subclass of &quot;un&quot;.  Perhaps
<br>
certain specific cases of falling flat might be
<br>
surfunny, but probably not anything so specific and
<br>
direct as to give noticable offense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How did Palm Pilots get their name?  What has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand held computing device to do with guiding an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aircraft or ship?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, they're legally just &quot;Palm&quot;s now.  Legal
<br>
troubles with Pilot Pen of Japan, you see.
<br>
<p>The Birds are for googling.  ^_-
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it that when extropian/SL4/singularitarian/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanist types gather, people bring *SO MUCH
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BEER*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then devour so very little of it?
</em><br>
<p>Because people think others will consume it, even if
<br>
they themselves do not.  It's a social meme.  (I, for
<br>
one, wouldn't mind if this got replaced with
<br>
non-alcoholic fruit juice being the default beverage,
<br>
instead of intoxicants or soda.  I suppose this would
<br>
require fruit juice to be cheaper - but if it were
<br>
consumed in larger quantities, it might be.  Ah, the
<br>
&quot;joys&quot; of catch-21s...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What the helllll did people do before there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
</em><br>
<p>It was a different lifestyle.  Many books have been
<br>
written on the actual lifestyles of said eras; there
<br>
is
<br>
even a group (Society for Creative Anachronism) that
<br>
tends to make pretty accurate recreations of medival
<br>
lifestyles, at least for a weekend or so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What did we do before there was an internet?
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What did extropians do before there was google?  Did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we just go around, like, not knowing stuff?
</em><br>
<p>Used alternate (if less efficient) means of research.
<br>
Including libraries and magazines.  Though consider
<br>
how
<br>
far back extropianism, as distinct from its
<br>
predecessors, goes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When we get wearable internet connections with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voice interface and fast google connections 24-7,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how are we going to explain to young people how we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever got along without that?
</em><br>
<p>Direct them to writeups of life as it was in the olden
<br>
days.  Hopefully more or less correct ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it, exactly, that sushi is soooo good?  Its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing but a wad of rice and a slice of bait, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheerfully drive way across town to get some.  Why?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Pizza for body.  Coffee for mind.  Sushi...for soul.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How many jokes are there that start with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variation of: An engineer, a mathematician and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a physicist go to a {fill in the blank}...
</em><br>
<p>N, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard about 800 hundred of them, and we weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even slowing down when the party spontaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave out.  Why is it that the mathematician always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says something silly and disconnected from reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we know it?  Are there any of those jokes where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mathematician is the smart guy?  I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematicians.
</em><br>
<p>Blame stereotyping, if you want: math is the most
<br>
abstract of the three professions; engineering the
<br>
least.  Besides, sin(x) is a mathematical function. 
<br>
;P
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are there any foods that Homer Simpson does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like?
</em><br>
<p>Not if he's in the right mood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What happens if an autistic prisoner is sentenced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solitary confinement?  Would she know?
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the prisoner.  Possibly, possibly not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How much power could be saved if the light inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the refrigerator were not left on all the time?
</em><br>
<p>It's not.  Put a webcam on a wireless link inside, or
<br>
at least a camcorder set to record so you can view it
<br>
later.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is it that there are so many extropians with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such enormous IQ numbers who cannot deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any mechanical device more complicated than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cerial box?
</em><br>
<p>Take it from a Mensan: one IQ measurement does not
<br>
measure all forms of intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Was Monte Hall intentionally screwing with people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds all those years?
</em><br>
<p>Provably unknowable, even to Monte Hall (his memories
<br>
could have been messed with).  So any attempt to
<br>
determine this is useless, at least for that purpose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Ameridebt got some loser's monthly payment cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in half, why didn't he just call them again and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it cut in forth, then an eighth and so on until he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was debt free?
</em><br>
<p>Xeno's paradox: smaller chunks, but larger number of
<br>
chunks, keeping the same volume.  Besides, cut in half
<br>
was one result, not necessarily a repeatable one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does *anyone* who hangs out on extropians or SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever read actual *fiction*, without the prefix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and presumably yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How did future fiction ever get the prefix sci to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start with?  Havent we always had science?  Did the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inventors of the genre assume we would have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science in the future?
</em><br>
<p>We haven't always had science.  In fact, &quot;science&quot;
<br>
fiction as a genre largely came about as the public
<br>
started becoming aware of the (then) mostly new
<br>
concepts of science: repeatable experiments, theories
<br>
backed or refuted by evidence, and so forth.  IIRC,
<br>
the
<br>
term &quot;science fiction&quot; was coined in the 19th century,
<br>
and judging by their works, the early sci-fi works
<br>
apparently did assume that there would be much more
<br>
science in the future.  Technically, even Sherlock
<br>
Holmes was science fiction when it was first written:
<br>
it predated (and, by many accounts, largely inspired
<br>
early efforts in) the science of forensics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do we call those oddball subcategories of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculative sci-fi like that show from the 60s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called Wild Wild West, where they had some weird
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futuristic technologies but was actually set in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past?  Is it still science fiction?  For that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, Star Wars is another good example.
</em><br>
<p>The literary term for stories like Wild Wild West is
<br>
steampunk.  There are actually a number of stories of
<br>
that nature; one might look to &quot;The Secret Adventures
<br>
of Jules Verne&quot; to find an example presently being
<br>
broadcast, or google for the term.  Likewise, Star
<br>
Wars
<br>
is a space opera, and many of those have also been
<br>
created.  Whether or not these genres are science
<br>
fiction depends on one's personal definition of the
<br>
term; perhaps a better term would be science fantasy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How did the diet thread get so huge?
</em><br>
<p>Consider the number of obese Americans.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we somehow accidentally discovered a seventh
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quark flavor, wont the physicists be majorly screwed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up?  Would they attempt a cover-up?  Would we call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it still-more-strange?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.  Depends on the circumstances,
<br>
peoples' reactions, and other unspecified conditions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cannot book publishers invent a kind of paper that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not get that old book smell when one's text
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books get old?  Would not it be a terrific business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity, to make replicas of old college
</em><br>
textbooks
<br>
<em>&gt; with new paper, so that one is not constantly
</em><br>
reminded
<br>
<em>&gt; that one is way into one's geezerhood?
</em><br>
<p>Said types of paper do exist.  However, it proved not
<br>
to be a terrific business opportunity, as opposed to
<br>
constantly coming out with new text to further justify
<br>
replacing the degrading paper.  Google for &quot;planned
<br>
obsolescence&quot; to see the general business concept.
<br>
(It's one I personally have little taste for, but one
<br>
must know one's enemy as well as oneself.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Marilyn vos Savant were to get on drugs and lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her mental focus, would we have to rename her
</em><br>
Marilyn
<br>
<em>&gt; vos Stupid?  Or would she become merely vos Normal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SurSavant?
</em><br>
<p>Depends on unspecified conditions, but likely no name
<br>
change would result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would anyone have guessed that a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could make a career out of simply understanding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian Theorem?
</em><br>
<p>Would, depending on what?  But it is likely that
<br>
someone, at some point in human history (after the
<br>
Bayesian Theorem was known to more than a few people),
<br>
has guessed that someone could make a living off of
<br>
simply understanding things of this nature.  More to
<br>
the point: there are other, similar examples of such,
<br>
perhaps with other formulas, but still making it very
<br>
easy to guess this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics, how can we be *absolutely sure* that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is one of them?
</em><br>
<p>By definition from Many Worlds.  Only a reality that
<br>
exists can be observed from, and Many Worlds basically
<br>
says that all the realities that can exist, do.  Since
<br>
we are observing from this reality...
