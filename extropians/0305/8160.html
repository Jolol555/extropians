You might have a point there about Gay activists, but i will also address a
<br>
point that President Reagan did not utter the word AIDS for a something like
<br>
6 years because it was affecting gay people. From the time scientists first
<br>
noticing AIDS in i think 1981, Reagan never even touched the topic. I guess
<br>
China with SARS just pulled a Reagan!
<br>
<p>Here is a blurb I just googled:
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
But perhaps the burgeoning AIDS epidemic posed the most defining public
<br>
health failure of Reagan's administration. Until 1987, six years into the
<br>
pandemic, Reagan never publicly mentioned AIDS and treated it as a state or
<br>
local issue. According to his White House physician at the time, Reagan
<br>
thought of AIDS as a kind of &quot;measles that would go away.&quot;
<br>
Reagan refused to order or fund preventive education programs and never
<br>
spoke out against the rampant fear and discrimination many HIV/AIDs patients
<br>
faced on the job, with insurance companies or at school. Marilyn Moon, a
<br>
long-time policy analyst at the Urban Institute, told me last month that
<br>
there was a &quot;great deal of fear that people with AIDS would try and qualify
<br>
for Medicare or other health programs and a lot of discussion by the
<br>
administration on how to keep them from bankrupting the medical system.&quot;
<br>
<p>AIDS activists say Reagan's one concrete proposal was for widespread testing
<br>
and mandatory identification of people with HIV, with the idea of enforcing
<br>
a public health quarantine.
<br>
<p>In fact, rather than providing for the public welfare, Reagan and his
<br>
closest advisors effectively muzzled then-Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop to
<br>
stop him from discussing AIDS publicly until midway through Reagan's second
<br>
term. It took the death of movie star Rock Hudson in 1985 and the Oct. 22,
<br>
1986, release of the surgeon general's report on acquired immune deficiency
<br>
syndrome, which advocated massive public education and a condom distribution
<br>
program, for Reagan to change his personal views. Even then, his response
<br>
was at best &quot;halting and ineffective,&quot; according to presidential biographer
<br>
and veteran Washington Post reporter Lou Cannon.
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>Reagan could have done much more to prevent AIDS than anyone and did
<br>
nothing. It was virtually criminal. The more I think about it, Reagans
<br>
silence does remind me of China and SARS...... Ironic!

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, the precedent set by the gay community in opposing HIV
