<em>&gt; The problem with this conclusion is that the previous estimate, which

<p>If their estimate of the whole pie was wrong, how do you hold them to their
<br>
estimate for one of the fractional parts?  And if the whole pie is shrunk,
<br>
why do you assume that the part you believe is real must now be the whole
<br>
pie.  I am sure the other side believes that their fraction is now a bigger
<br>
piece of the smaller pie.  Maybe the whole pie shrank proportionally.
<br>
<p>I'm not disputing that your claim isn't right.  But it isn't proven and the
<br>
other side isn't defeated or discredited.  Remember that this study only
<br>
confirmed satellite data for about 20 years.  We are extrapolating much
<br>
further than that into the future, and are relying on previous (unconfirmed)
<br>
data from the past.  This study is an excellent step in nailing down exactly
<br>
what is happening, but it is too early to declare victory and stop
<br>
researching.  We need to extend our understanding and confirmation of the
<br>
data much further.  Also remember that this study said they were &quot;95%&quot; sure
<br>
of their data.
<br>
<p>In other words, your claim is looking good.  You are 95% proven and
<br>
consistent with the last 20 years.  Why overstate the claim to 100% and
<br>
covering all centuries?  Why not take the actual victory as it occurred, and
<br>
keep working toward better?
