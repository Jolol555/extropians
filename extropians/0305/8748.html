<p>Either I've got false memories or you've got a gap.  I recall discussing 
<br>
this with you, albeit briefly.  Humans being what they are, we'll never 
<br>
know.  Probably the blue people changed it.  You remember the blue people, 
<br>
right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes of course.  And while I would clearly like to see the resources

</em><br>
<em>&gt; production of extropic vs. entropic information -- I *do* not know

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Classical economic theories would suggest that a penny of extropic
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; information later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question I would ask is how one might know that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total (extropic) information content of any web arena is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater this saturday than next saturday.  If one cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that then everthing from allocating ones time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pricing tickets seems up for grabs.
</em><br>
<p>Clearly what the world needs is a more sophisticated Fun Theory.  On the 
<br>
discount-rate issue, I'm not quite sure the classical economists have it 
<br>
right; a good decision theory should IMHO be timeless, but may timelessly 
<br>
take into account properties of the 4D process that is a sentient being, 
<br>
rather than insisting that the utility function be applied only to 3D 
<br>
slices of reality.  So it's not necessarily how much total fun you have, 
<br>
but the progress of fun over time, and whether you can manage to have more 
<br>
and more fun.  So in that sense, all you may need today is a penny of fun, 
<br>
and tomorrow you'll have a pound of fun, and the important thing is that 
<br>
you're having more fun.  So on that basis it may be quite a while before 
<br>
we *have* to disassemble the stars... yet it is worth remembering that 
<br>
they're wasting a heck of a lot of irreplaceable low-entropy-state meanwhile.
<br>
<p>As for how to shut a star down... even human physicists get *really 
<br>
creative* when they're given time to think about something.  The way they 
<br>
make Bose-Einstein condensates, that trick they recently demonstrated with 
<br>
shifting light to arbitrary frequencies using shock waves in photonic 
<br>
crystals... some creative fellow will think about stellar dynamics for 
<br>
around 10 milliseconds and work out a way to send a set of shock waves 
<br>
through the star that build up in *just* the right way to disassemble the 
<br>
star in a nice, controlled way, ejecting globs of matter, until it goes 
<br>
out.  Or, like, whatever.  You wouldn't want to do this with Sol, maybe, 
<br>
for sentimental reasons.  But the rest of the galaxy?  Heck, why not?  You 
<br>
could put little flashlights in the appropriate places, and the 
<br>
Pedestrians would never know the difference.  If anyone complains about 
<br>
the romance, you could attach little sentiences to the flashlights so that 
<br>
the stars actually *care* about the way you look at them, and are 
<br>
flattered by the attention.  That beats a distant nonsapient ball of 
<br>
burning gas any day, right?  You could even change the boring old 
<br>
Newtonian orbits of the &quot;planet&quot; flashlights such that the new 
<br>
trajectories reflect the SI's predictions of future political events in a 
<br>
way that can be decoded by astrologers... okay, shutting up now.
