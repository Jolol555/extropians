<em>&gt; &gt; Point 2 goes on to say that &quot;all fats raise HDL&quot; as if this

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you say this? Certainly it is better to see LDL drop while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HDL rises,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a rise in HDL.
</em><br>
<p>Good catch!  To be more clear, I should have said &quot;unless LDLs are lowered
<br>
or at least not raised.&quot;  Where total cholesterol is measured without
<br>
distinguishing between HDL and LDL, we cannot infer anything good or bad
<br>
from the fact that total cholesterol is raised.  Total cholesterol increases
<br>
does not tell us if HDL was raised without raising LDL, or if both were
<br>
raised proportionately, or if LDL was raised more.  An increase in total
<br>
cholesterol may not be bad, but it may not be good either.  I think both HDL
<br>
and LDL must be measured to know for sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would say that as long as total cholesterol does not rise significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above ~200, any increase in HDL/LDL is a good thing even if LDL does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decline. Studies show that the risk of heart disease is inversely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to plasma HDL.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the first part.  Raising HDL while keeping LDL the same does
<br>
improve the ratio.  This is good.  But I think the second part is
<br>
oversimplified.  Raising HDL is not necessarily good by itself.  If LDL is
<br>
not kept even, but increases as well, then the ratio is not improved.  I
<br>
think this would be worse (or at least no improvement).  LDLs tend to build
<br>
up on artery walls, while HDLs tend to remove this buildup.  I am not sure
<br>
if increasing both the buildup and the cleanup equally is a net wash or
<br>
loses something in the inefficiency or requirement of extra repair work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few days ago I posted an abstract here about the adverse effects on mood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that occur when switching from a high-fat to a low-fat diet. I did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention it at the time, but the statistics in that abstract show also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant reduction in HDL from the low-fat diet, *without* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponding reduction in LDL or total cholesterol. Here is the relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excerpt:
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this.  A low-fat diet that does not distinguish between good
<br>
fats and bad fats ends up lowering the good ones as well as the bad ones.
<br>
The results are a net wash at best, or poor nutrition usually.
<br>
<p>In typical mail-list fashion, I only responded to the studies I had problems
<br>
with.  I did not respond to this study to say that I agree with it.  Low-fat
<br>
diets are old school before we learned to distinguish different fats.
<br>
People who avoided all fats, including good fats, and worse including
<br>
essential fatty acids, omegas and other helpful fats ended up becoming
<br>
deficient in these required fat nutrients.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I remain convinced that extremely low-fat diets are unhealthy.
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree.  Besides there being several required fat nutrients, there
<br>
are a number of other fat-soluble nutrients that can only be digested and
<br>
processed in the presence of fats.  Avoiding all fats is a simple recipe for
<br>
nutritional deficiency in all lipid-soluble nutrients and required fatty
<br>
acids.
<br>
<p>I think the only place where we would disagree on fats is that I believe in
<br>
a certain ratio of fats which prefers essential fatty acids &gt;
<br>
monounsaturated &gt; polyunsaturated &gt; saturated &gt; hydrogenised.  I am not sure
<br>
if you have no preference between different kinds of fats, or if you prefer
<br>
the reverse order than I do.
<br>
As far as all the studies you post, I tend to only jump on the ones I don't
<br>
like and ignore the ones that I think are OK.  I apologize for the
<br>
inconsistency, but it seems to be a side-effect of e-mail lists.
<br>
<p>My biggest problem with some older studies is that they don't distinguish
<br>
between different kinds of fats or different kinds of cholesterol.  When
<br>
they lump them all together, we can't be sure what is being measured or what
<br>
the results were due to.  One &quot;high-fat&quot; or &quot;low-fat&quot; diet could be all
<br>
saturated fats while another is all essential fatty acids.  We can't combine
<br>
them or compare them or get any useful data.  It leads us to no conclusion
<br>
as to whether we should increase or decrease &quot;fats&quot;, or which kinds.  I have
<br>
a similar objection to any measure of &quot;total cholesterol&quot; which doesn't
<br>
distinguish between HDL or LDL.  (An unrelated but similar nitpick I have is
<br>
the measure of vitamin B12 which doesn't distinguish between usable B12 and
<br>
unusable analogs, especially in plants which have lots of analogs but no
<br>
usable B12.)
