I guess the problem is the temptation to use the
<br>
maximum recommended dosage.
<br>
<p>So, for several days, since I was buying SAMe by the
<br>
case now, at $1.50/20x200mg, I figured, &quot;well, this is
<br>
a store brand to begin with, and slightly out-of-date
<br>
as well, so I'll figure that a 2-to-1 ratio is
<br>
probably legit, so I'll just take a whole box each
<br>
day...&quot;
<br>
<p>And then, I went into Bally's the next night (Friday)
<br>
for my regular workout, adding some caffiene ($1/box
<br>
of 16x200mg.), CLA ($2/large bottle), libido fuel ($2
<br>
- arginine/muirma ???), biogra (orchic tissue, plus a
<br>
dozen other testosterone boosters), and Twinlab's
<br>
Androstenedione formulation - oh, forgot - 25mg. DHEA
<br>
and 50 mg. pregnenalone.
<br>
<p>I don't know if anyone noticed that I was walking on
<br>
air - actually, kind of walzing on air listening to
<br>
disco via my headset.  But when I did six or so
<br>
machines at the max weights - 20 reps, fast - without
<br>
breathing hard, in time with the music beat, I started
<br>
noticing about fifteen people had stopped working out
<br>
and were just staring at me.  Surprisingly, I was able
<br>
to get to sleep ok and felt fine the next morning as
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>AND, next year I get my senior discounts at the
<br>
movies!  Better living thru chemistry...
