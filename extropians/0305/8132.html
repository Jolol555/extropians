</em><br>
<p>This is the most important point.  Heterosexual men can get AIDS in America,
<br>
so they should wear a condom to protect themselves.  However, Fumento often
<br>
implies that heterosexual men can't get AIDS, implying that they don't need
<br>
to wear condoms.  His book title is misleading.  (Heterosexual AIDS is not a
<br>
myth, the heterosexual epidemic in America might be overhyped.)  Fumento
<br>
also explains African AIDS by saying most of the men lie about having gay
<br>
sex.  That is, he still implies that they must be gay or they wouldn't have
<br>
gotten AIDS.  Although he seems careful not to state this directly, or
<br>
directly tell heterosexual men in America not to bother wearing condoms, he
<br>
comes close to implying this position often.  As a scientific debunker of
<br>
pseudoscience, he seems awfully careful not to offend his conservative
<br>
financiers.
<br>
<p>In other areas, he also claims that Gulf War Syndrome, Agent Orange, DDT,
<br>
Radon Gas, Asbestos, the Atkins Diet, Nutritional Supplements, and even the
<br>
need for fetal stem cell research are all liberal myths and lies.  He has
<br>
debunked so many things, that it is really rare to find anyone who agrees
<br>
with all his claims.
