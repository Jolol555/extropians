<a href="mailto:Dehede011@aol.com?Subject=RE:%20(IRAQ)%20RE:%20Name%20calling%20vs.%20Ad%20Hominem">Dehede011@aol.com</a> wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; I think what you wrote clearly was disappointed that the media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allegedly (by you) was totally under the thumb of the Army and had not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reported the war honestly.  To conclude that you were not on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side of the American Army was not unreasonable.
</em><br>
<p>Firstly, you are twisting the conversation around.  I was trying to disprove
<br>
your statement that the media was totally out of control and anti-army all
<br>
the time.  I was giving counter examples where the media was in control of
<br>
the army and pro-army.  I am trying to disprove your point rather than argue
<br>
my own position.
<br>
<p>Secondly, I think that this is an example of extreme black-and-white
<br>
thinking.  I do think that the army controlled the embedded reporters more
<br>
than they could before they were embedded.  I.E., the embedding gave the
<br>
army more control not less.  Why this should be interpreted as being &quot;for&quot;
<br>
the reporters and &quot;against&quot; the army is beyond me.  It was merely an
<br>
observation of the control factor.  It has no relationship to picking sides.
<br>
To assume that my statements were anti-army, of even worse, that they
<br>
indicated my desire for harm to befall our troops, is way over the top
<br>
compared to what I actually said.  I said the embedded media was under the
<br>
control of the army.  This is not an anti-American statement of hate, an
<br>
endorsement of Saddam, or a traitorous attack wishing disaster for our
<br>
military forces.
<br>
<p>I am increasingly disturbed by this trend within the Extropians and in
<br>
various transhumanist movements.  The &quot;politically correct&quot; attitude is to
<br>
support the cause so much that any negative statement instantly brands
<br>
someone as &quot;the enemy&quot;.  If someone questions any motive by the government,
<br>
they are a traitor.  If someone questions whether embedded reporters were
<br>
controlled by the military, they are hoping Americans die.  If someone
<br>
questions whether nanoparticles might be dangerous to breath in, they are an
<br>
anti-technology Luddite.  These responses are extreme and classify someone
<br>
to the most extreme point on all positions relating to a subject.  These
<br>
responses have nothing to do with the specific statements being made.  This
<br>
seems to be a design flaw in human nature and the way we communicate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However you have said since that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were not disappointed that the Army did not suffer some tragedy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your word is good enough.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for this.  But I am still in &quot;shock and awe&quot; that you would brand
<br>
me as an enemy sympathizer for merely suggested that embedded reporters were
<br>
controlled by the army more than non-embedded ones.  This seems obvious and
<br>
simple to me, and not anti-American hate as you immediately branded it.
<br>
Worse, you implied that I had an entire history of such anti-American
<br>
statements and that my position was well-known.  This is a major
<br>
misrepresentation of me, for reasons I cannot fathom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, how you can conclude that the Army as an organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated the media is beyond me.
</em><br>
<p>First of all, nobody controls all the media.  The truth is that there are
<br>
right-wing and left-wing companies controlling the media.  Everything is not
<br>
a black-and-white issue as you seem to always see it.  I am trying to
<br>
disprove your statement that the anti-army liberals control all media.  This
<br>
does not mean I am trying to prove that pro-army conservatives control all
<br>
media.  I don't know why so many people jump to extremes in every
<br>
conversation and seem unable to grasp any middle-ground positions of any
<br>
kind.
<br>
<p>We know that the military has been controlling the media more and more with
<br>
every war.  The embedded reporters were totally controlled by the military.
<br>
They could not report anything without it being censored and approved by the
<br>
military.  There were many examples of reports from the embedded media not
<br>
matching other reporters, even within the same network.  CNN often had
<br>
embedded reporters give stories about the U.S. military taking over a town
<br>
and having celebrations in the street, while their unembedded reporter in
<br>
the same country reports live that there is no sign of the military and the
<br>
streets are quiet.  This is not an anti-army position.  The army clearly
<br>
used the embedded reporters for propaganda and for spinning the story in
<br>
support of the war as a military tool.  This is simply factual history and
<br>
what I would expect from the army.  Bush even has announced that we have
<br>
greatly increased our disinformation arm, and has stated that these will use
<br>
the media and even file false reports with our allies to help our causes.
<br>
Just because I recognize these facts or that I am more wary of the
<br>
government and military after they have announced their intent to start a
<br>
disinformation campaign does not imply that I am anti-American.  I own my
<br>
own company and am rich enough to move wherever I want.  I choose to stay
<br>
and work in America, which is more than President Cheney's Haliburton or
<br>
Enron chose to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; testimony of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct media involved that some of them were shilling for Sadaam.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are reading too much into CNN's admission.  They said that their
<br>
sources within Iraq reported such specific details that they could not be
<br>
reported for fear that Saddam would kill these people and their families.
<br>
I.E., the details were so specific that just the story itself would indicate
<br>
who leaked the story.  This is no different than the government intelligence
<br>
refusing to reveal sources that would get their agents killed.  Withholding
<br>
information to save the lives of people being held hostage in Iraq, and to
<br>
keep that channel of information open for future use, is a standard military
<br>
tactic.  I don't mind it being used by the reporters, especially if it saved
<br>
lives.  Maybe such activities indirectly helped Saddam, but the intent was
<br>
to save their sources lives, not to help Saddam.  They didn't want to see
<br>
pro-American contacts in Iraq killed, which is a far different motive than
<br>
wanting to support Saddam.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; watched the nightly news casts we know the media repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forecast doom and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gloom.  We also know that the forecasts didn't even come close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.
</em><br>
<p>This is just the nature of trying to predict the future.  Even the President
<br>
warned that the fighting would take much longer than it really did.  Just
<br>
because people don't predict the future of the war accurately does not mean
<br>
that they were rooting for the enemy.  Does the failure of the WMD
<br>
prediction mean that conservatives secretly wish that Saddam had WMD?  Of
<br>
course not.  A failed prediction is not the same as personal desire.
<br>
<p>And since when is predicting failure the sign of a traitor?  Why can't
<br>
people honestly dispute their government's motives and methods without being
<br>
branded the enemy?  There really are good reasons to doubt whether there are
<br>
WMD, or whether this invasion was planned before 9/11, etc.  There are not
<br>
traitorous statements, or litmus tests for patriotism.  Any requirement that
<br>
people believe the official line without question is repugnant to freedom
<br>
itself.
