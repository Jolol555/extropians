Harvey Newstrom falsely charged in another thread:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People reading this stuff [about paleodiet theory] (rightly in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrow case) classify us as religious cultists who use circular logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and pseudoscience to prove our believes to others as if they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; established scientific fact.
</em><br>
<p>Paleodiet theory is a scientific theory that attempts to explain empirical
<br>
facts, no different from any other scientific theory. It is not a religion.
<br>
It is not a cult. 
<br>
<p>If you want to see circular logic, Harvey, then look to those who rely only
<br>
on nutrition science to explain the facts.
<br>
<p>For example here is a fact that few dispute: 
<br>
<p>FACT: Fruits and vegetables are healthy components of the human diet.
<br>
<p>Ask a nutritionist to explain this fact and you will get an answer like
<br>
this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Fruits and vegetables are healthy because they contain lots of important
<br>
vitamins, minerals and other nutrients important to good health.&quot;
<br>
<p>But is that a good explanation of the fact? No. It is a tautology, an
<br>
elucidation of the same fact in greater detail. It does not explain *why*
<br>
the fact is true. The next question to the nutritionist would be, &quot;Okay,
<br>
fine, but how do you explain the fact that said nutrients found in
<br>
fruits/veggies are important to good health?&quot; And the nutritionist will once
<br>
again offer a tautology. He will describe in even greater detail the
<br>
mechanisms by which said nutrients work in the human metabolism to support
<br>
good health, as if this were an answer to the question. But we already knew
<br>
that substances found in fruits/veggies are good for us, even if we didn't
<br>
know the exact mechanisms by which they work.
<br>
<p>Paleodiet theory answers the question with a true explanation. The paleodiet
<br>
theorist explains: &quot;Fruits and vegetables are good for human health because
<br>
they contain substances, some discovered and probably also some as yet
<br>
undiscovered, to which the human genome became adapted over millions of
<br>
years of evolution. Our friends the nutritionists can supply us with a
<br>
description of the known biological mechanisms of some of those adaptations,
<br>
and those descriptions are certainly very useful, but that is all they can
<br>
do. They cannot in the end tell us *why* these plant substances are good for
<br>
human health.&quot;
<br>
<p>Simply stated, for paleodiet theorists there is a good reason why certain
<br>
foods are nutritious, whereas for nutrition scientists it's &quot;turtles all the
<br>
way down.&quot;
