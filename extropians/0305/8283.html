<p><em>&gt; In reality, we need to be specific. There are hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of subtopics relating to the war on Iraq. All sides were right about some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and wrong about others. It make no sense to try to prove one group more or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less right than another. Even if we gathered all the statistics, we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably disagree on which predictions were more important than others. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any case, I believe that the accuracy of either side will have the obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority in correctness that believers always assume. Both sides rate their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues as important and dismiss other issues they don't care about
</em><br>
<p>Despite the difficulties, such fine-grained measurement might be worth 
<br>
trying. We could rank the issues. We could separate the issues into what 
<br>
is practical versus the if-I-were-king scenarios. We could make charts 
<br>
and graphs so we'd have better understanding of where we're coming from. 
<br>
We could experiment with the mailing list protocols itself to aid in 
<br>
clear separation of distinct issues.
<br>
<p>We could do such because we're a group that supposedly has some 
<br>
agreement with the group's charter. We could discuss the issues 
<br>
generally, or we could discuss how they relate to the charter, or 
<br>
perhaps other agreements (such as the U.S. Constitution) which we may 
<br>
live under.
<br>
<p>Whether attacking Iraq is/was a good thing or not may be discussed in 
<br>
if-I-were-king mode, where anything goes, and where questions such as is 
<br>
it good to kill ten people to save twenty can be gone over in 
<br>
excruciating detail. But in the practical world, such talk is about 
<br>
killing people.
<br>
<p>Also, again in the practical world, supporting government wars of 
<br>
aggression -- unless such is funded by voluntary contributions -- means 
<br>
supporting government coercion of those who don't wish to participate. 
<br>
The government takes enough of my money already, I don't need supposed 
<br>
extropians/libertarians rooting for them to go ever deeper into debt by 
<br>
building ever more expensive weaponry and bombing people with it.
