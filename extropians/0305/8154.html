<p>O'Reilly doesn't allow his guests to do anything except listen. :) Thanks

though for telling me that he supports gun control. Now I think even less of

him. :)

<p><em>&gt; FOX clearly identifies its editorial programming from its

</em><br>
<p>I'll give you an example of FOX-biased news reporting that comes to mind:
<br>
prior to Gulf War II, Jimmy Carter published an op-ed in a major newspaper
<br>
expressing his sincere concerns about the impending war. Rather than treat
<br>
this as factual news worthy of careful and intelligent journalism, which it
<br>
was, FOX portrayed it as some kind of scandal. 
<br>
<p>I distinctly recall the lead-in to the commercial break &quot;Coming up after the
<br>
break: Jimmy Carter takes a cheap shot at president Bush!&quot; 
<br>
<p>Now, I am not a democrat and I have never voted for any democrat, but I must
<br>
say that Jimmy Carter deserves better than that. He's a fine man worthy of
<br>
my respect even I disagree with his politics. Unfortunately the FOX audience
<br>
is always hungry to chew on liberals so FOX gave them the meal they were
<br>
wanting.
<br>
<p>FOX did the same to the Pope, of all people. I'm not Catholic but I do have
<br>
several devout Catholic friends. I was appalled for their sakes that FOX
<br>
went out of its way to criticize and disrespect the Pope for allegedly not
<br>
having the moral authority to have an opinion about the war. If the western
<br>
world's most prominent religious leader has no moral authority then who
<br>
does? 
<br>
<p>Somehow I think FOX would not have criticized the Pope had the subject been
<br>
abortion.
