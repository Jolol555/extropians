<em>&gt; &gt; Two things are refreshing about Fox News (and at least one or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; two newscasters on MSNBC):  they're not only providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; balance to ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN, but they're quite open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about it.  What I hate is people pretending they're objective, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they're not. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We disagree here (I think we covered this once before). Yes FOX is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blatantly right-wing, but it advertises itself as unbiased. The FOX
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogan, repeated many times each day, is something like &quot;News 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without the Spin,&quot; but in fact they offer more spin than any network
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've ever seen in all my life.
</em><br>
<p>Only OReilly bills his time slot as &quot;The No Spin Zone&quot;. Furthermore, I
<br>
don't consider OReilly a spinmeister. He doesn't mince words or parse
<br>
sentences, he tells it like it is as he sees it. That isn't spin. What
<br>
he doesn't do is allow guests to twist the truth or write new
<br>
definitions of the word &quot;is&quot;. That is what spin is: disinformation,
<br>
deflection, obfuscation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; O'Reilly bills himself as &quot;independent&quot; but I don't think he's ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once entertained an opinion that serious liberals would find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable.
</em><br>
<p>Shows how much you've been paying attention. OReilly is specifically
<br>
for gun control and for gay/lesbian adoption, just to name a few
<br>
liberal positions he holds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He was registered GOP until recently when a reporter on another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network called him on his dishonesty in billing himself as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent. Cavuto and Hannity are like rabid junior Newt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gingrichs. 
</em><br>
<p>Hannity doesnt advertise himself as any kind of a news anchor, and
<br>
while Cavuto has editorials, he clearly identifies them as such, unlike
<br>
CNN, ABC, CBS, or NBC anchors.
<br>
<p>FOX clearly identifies its editorial programming from its news
<br>
programming, unlike what the rest of the media does.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Cable news networks are not obliged by law to serve the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; interest, which is one reason we see extreme advocacy journalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; on cable like that which comes from FOX.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, we know how to fix that, don't we?  How about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nah. I want less regulation, not more.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, cable is allowed to ghettoize it, which is where public
<br>
access channels come from.
