<p>I think I am thinking of something slightly different than what you think,
<br>
Anders. Perhaps I should have written my sentence differently. Probably we
<br>
are not in real disagreement here.
<br>
<p>Let me try it this way: I would like to see 6 billion (or, for that matter,
<br>
any number of billions) of &quot;healthy, educated, prosperous&quot; humans on Earth,
<br>
with no significant percentage of them &quot;impoverished&quot; and &quot;scrambling
<br>
desperately for resources.&quot; Anything less is a disaster that could have been
<br>
avoided but for the massive expansion of the human population, a population
<br>
explosion made possible by agriculture. 
<br>
<p>And we are already living in the disaster of which I speak. A large fraction
<br>
of humans are scrambling desperately for resources. A large fraction are
<br>
unhealthy. A large fraction are 
<br>
uneducated. I am not, as you think, merely predicting some disaster of the
<br>
future based on some theory. 
<br>
<p>The disaster is enormous today with only ~6 billion of us on board the ship,
<br>
and may very well get worse, especially if population increases with no
<br>
significant change in strategy with respect to agriculture.
