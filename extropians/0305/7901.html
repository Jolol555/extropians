<em>&gt; ON THE TUBE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May 8th 2003
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; From The Economist print edition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1763552">http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1763552</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A new type of computer memory uses carbon, rather than silicon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WAITING for a computer to turn on is a nuisance. That is why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been trying to create ³non-volatile² memories. These would be fast,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the random-access memory (RAM) chips that are currently used for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often-accessed memory, but they would also continue to store information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even without power, like hard drives, which are too slow to use except 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-term storage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Several technologies have been competing to become the standard for fast,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-volatile memory. The best known is magnetic RAM, which IBM and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Motorola
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are touting. Others are based on polymers or on strange-sounding metal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alloys called chalcogenides that change shape when an electric charge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied to them. But there is now a new entrant to the field: carbon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Carbon comes in many forms. Diamonds and graphite are two of the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar ones. A less familiar variety is the nanotube, also known as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ³buckytube² after Richard Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework similar to the arrangement of the atoms in a nanotube. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nanotubes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consist of a cylindrical array of carbon atoms whose diameter is only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 nanometre (a billionth of a metre). If Nantero, a firm based in Woburn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Massachusetts, proves correct, such tubes will soon be an integral part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer memories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nantero's memory chips consist of billions of nanotubes, each a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanometres long, suspended from a silicon wafer. Another wafer sits about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 nanometres below the first. Because the nanotubes that Nantero uses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conduct electricity, a small electric charge at one point on the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wafer will draw several dozen nanotubes towards it. Once they are there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they stay there. That is because they are bound by Van der Waals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces‹intermolecular bonds that do not depend on external power for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintenance. An additional application of current, however, will release 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotubes. This means that a group of a few dozen nanotubes can act as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory element, storing a single bit (either a one or a zero) of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; binary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code that computers use to operate. If the connection between the wafers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live at a particular point, the bit represented is a one. If not, it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If nanotubes were not so small, this would not be a big deal. Because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, though, Nantero's technology can already achieve a data density
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerably higher than existing RAMs. And because the wafers are so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together, those data can move rapidly from place to place. Nantero's new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory can read or write a bit in as little as half a nanosecond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (billionth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a second). The best RAM chips, by contrast, need ten nanoseconds to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform a similar operation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the moment, Nantero has only a working prototype. But the firm aims to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have memories on the market within a year. It thinks it will be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up for commercial production quickly, because the fabrication technique 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uses, though novel, relies on standard semiconductor-making technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The main difficulty faced by others who have tried to go down the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buckytube
</em><br>
<em>&gt; route is getting the tubes to align with each other when they are hung 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first wafer. Until now, the approach has been to try to grow all of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tubes in the correct orientation to start with. But Nantero's founders 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with a simpler, if less elegant, solution. They use established
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lithographic techniques to get rid of tubes that are pointing in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction by zapping them with an electron beam. That leaves only those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are hanging down towards the opposite wafer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though the recent chip is certainly impressive, the reason for getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excited about Nantero is not so much the present as the future. Unlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silicon, which is pushing against its physical limitations, carbon- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotube
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology is in its infancy. Greg Schmergel, Nantero's boss, says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the next few years the firm's engineers may be able to achieve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; densities of a trillion bits per square centimetre (more than 1,000 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that available on existing RAM) and it will be possible to read those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories 100 times faster than can be done at the moment. The days of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silicon-based memory may be numbered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
