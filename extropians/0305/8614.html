<em>&gt; &quot;The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.agron.iastate.edu/courses/agron342/diamondmistake.html">http://www.agron.iastate.edu/courses/agron342/diamondmistake.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an excellent article by Jared Diamond that appeared in Discovery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Magazine in 5/87. According to Diamond, agriculture is the worst mistake in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the history of the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diamond acknowledges that the pre-agricultural diet was a healthier diet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lists variations on this theme as the first and second of three reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the poor health of early farmers. The third of his three reasons is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed increased disease from over-crowding, but he adds parenthetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that arguments of archeologists who claim this as the only reason are really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just chicken-and-egg arguments, because &quot;crowding encourages agriculture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vice versa.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excerpt from the article:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There are at least three sets of reasons to explain the findings that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agriculture was bad for health. First, hunter-gatherers enjoyed a varied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet, while early farmers obtained most of their food from one or a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starchy crops. The farmers gained cheap calories at the cost of poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutrition. (today just three high-carbohydrate plants-wheat, rice, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corn-provide the bulk of the calories consumed by the human species, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each one is deficient in certain vitamins or amino acids essential to life.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, because of dependence on a limited number of crops, farmers ran the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk of starvation if one crop failed. Finally, the mere fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agriculture encouraged people to clump together in crowded societies, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which then carried on trade with other crowded societies, led to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread of parasites and infectious disease. (Some archaeologists think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the crowding, rather than agriculture, that promoted disease, but this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a chicken-and-egg argument, because crowding encourages agriculture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vice versa.) Epidemics couldn't take hold when populations were scattered in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small bands that constantly shifted camp. Tuberculosis and diarrheal disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to await the rise of farming, measles and bubonic plague the appearance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of large cities.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Let's not forget standing armies.  Agriculture enabled people to produce 
<br>
more food than they needed to feed themselves alone, enabling the rise of 
<br>
a ruling class that subsisted off other people's work and could force them 
<br>
to work 16-hour days to feed as many boss-class individuals as possible. 
<br>
And of course, the transition to agriculture marks the transition from 
<br>
work to which we are adapted, and which we presumably found fulfilling or 
<br>
at least tolerable, to &quot;work&quot; in the sense of mental-energy-sapping, 
<br>
life-force-draining labor.
<br>
<p>Is it really worth it to be able to read the Feynman Lectures?  I would 
<br>
say yes; your own mileage may vary.  Fortunately the dilemna is a 
<br>
temporary one.
