Greg Jordan:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may be a muddle to you, but it's not a muddle to me :) I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not talking about human instincts, about which we know very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little. I also tend to be suspicious of the &quot;just so&quot; stories 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of evolutionary psychology/sociobiology.
</em><br>
<p>I certainly hope you're equally suspicious of this baloney from your
<br>
.sig: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.resourcesoftheworld.org/guardianformation.htm">http://www.resourcesoftheworld.org/guardianformation.htm</a> 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm talking about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoyment you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (possibly) access in the present, yourself. Watch a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature documentaries, interact with a friend's pet a bit. See 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you don't get some pleasure from animals other than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chowing down on their burnt muscles.
</em><br>
<p>I really wouldn't want to frolic with a pig, nor would I want to eat my
<br>
neighbors dog. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves. Our far-from-ordinary brains do many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intractable things, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and we sometimes invent words to facilitate discussion of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as 'happiness', 'reason', or 'thought'. To say an animal is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'happy' or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'sad' might help children and bad poets understand animal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little better. But it certainly doesn't help me, and it certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't imply anything profound to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inferring animal emotion and rationality (ability to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculate with various algorithms) helps animal trainers, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmers, even hunters - everyone who really has to understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an animal in immediately practical terms.
</em><br>
<p>This is just another way of saying 'in terms they can understand'. I
<br>
would bet half my life savings and investments that someone who
<br>
understands dogs is a better dog trainer than someone who understands
<br>
people. I would bet the other half of my life savings and investments
<br>
that someone who understands cows is a better dairy farmer than someone
<br>
who understands people. Animal emotion or rationality inferences are
<br>
*unjustifiable* by mere analogy to people.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary for someone who has no interaction with live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals, or who has a vested interest in promoting human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value superiority across every domain.
</em><br>
<p>I appreciate your right to love animals for their whatever. As long as
<br>
you don't insist I should too, then we can co-exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans aren't the only animals that are unique or that have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special tricks of the trade of life. Bird brains can do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things mine can't, and that I might wish it could. (We are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just now developing the technology to allow us to imitate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of its features and adapt it for our use).
</em><br>
<p>I have no doubt a bird brain is much better than mine at blindly getting
<br>
more bird genes into the next generation, but I can't think of much else
<br>
it would beat me at. 
<br>
