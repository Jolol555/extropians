<p><em>&gt; Here's my take:
</em><br>
<p>Your take is wrong. Welcome to the list of people trying to pigeon-hole me. 
<br>
<p>As I just finished writing last night to Lee Crocker...
<br>
<p>I am using the word &quot;adapted&quot; according to its concise definition as it
<br>
relates
<br>
to evolution. It is impossible for an organism to be adapted to an
<br>
environment
<br>
in which it did *not* evolve. Adaptation is a process that happens only in
<br>
the
<br>
context of an environment. 
<br>
<p>It is meaningless therefore to say that humans might be better adapted to
<br>
some other environment in which it did not evolve. We are best (or only)
<br>
adapted to environments in which we *did* evolve. And just as a giraffe is
<br>
adapted to eating the leaves of tall trees, a human is adapted to eating an
<br>
omnivorous diet of lean meats, fish, fowl, fruits, vegetables and nuts. 
<br>
<p>Humans might be able to improve on the natural diet (i.e., to thrive in an
<br>
environment which humans are not adapted). In fact we already do so when we
<br>
use unnatural substances such as medicines to cure or prevent illness. I am
<br>
not suggesting that anyone should not consume medicines, or any food or herb
<br>
or any substance whatsoever that has been proven to be beneficial to the
<br>
diet. I take many non-paleolithic substances myself, but only because I see
<br>
sufficient evidence for them.
<br>
<p>And I am certainly not suggesting that anyone sleep outdoors, or in caves,
<br>
or go back to living hunter-gatherer lifestyles. This is about diet only.
<br>
