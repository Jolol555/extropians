<p>This is akin to the &quot;progressivist perspective,&quot; which Diamond flatly
<br>
rejects. As he puts it, &quot;The progressivist party line sometimes even goes so
<br>
far as to credit agriculture with the remarkable flowering of art that has
<br>
taken place over the past few thousand years. Since crops can be stored, and
<br>
since it takes less time to pick food from a garden than to find it in the
<br>
wild, agriculture gave us free time that hunter-gatherers never had. Thus it
<br>
was agriculture that enabled us to build the Parthenon and compose the
<br>
B-minor Mass... While the case for the progressivist view seems
<br>
overwhelming, it's hard to prove... It turns out that [HG'ers] have plenty
<br>
of leisure time, sleep a good deal, and work less hard than their farming
<br>
neighbors... One Bushman, when asked why he hadn't emulated neighboring
<br>
tribes by adopting agriculture, replied, &quot;Why should we, when there are so
<br>
many mongongo nuts in the world?... Gorillas have had ample free time to
<br>
build their own Parthenon, had they wanted to....&quot;
<br>
<p>One could extrapolate from this passage that according to Diamond's view of
<br>
progressivism, agriculture set us also on the path towards &quot;culture,
<br>
superhuman intelligence and the stars,&quot; but that hunter-gatherers would not
<br>
and should not care about such things.
<br>
<p>It seems a bit presumptuous to assume that superhuman intelligence and a
<br>
reaching toward the stars would even be seen as desirable by a contrafactual
<br>
humanity that might still live in a pristine world not ruined by agriculture
<br>
and its modern cultural ramifications. 
<br>
<p>One might even argue that extropianism is a philosophical attempt to prepare
<br>
an escape from the doomed world we created at the advent of agriculture.
