Actually, it is the choice of the variables to map to
<br>
the dimensions which is important.  Nolan saw
<br>
correctly that (1) there could be a fairly clean
<br>
division of state coercion into social vs. economic
<br>
and (2) that this division in fact reflected closely
<br>
the real political divisions, so much so, in fact,
<br>
that he ventured to use the resultant map to make
<br>
predictions as to future trends and possible
<br>
successful strategies.  (Note that I am well aware -
<br>
as is David Nolan - that the division between social
<br>
and economic levels of coercion embodies a lot of
<br>
crossover and ambiguity.  Not enough to render the
<br>
chart useless, however, by a long shot.)
<br>
<p>He could, after all, have used other variables:
<br>
red/blond hair vs. black/brunette, or, race-based, or
<br>
rich vs. poor, but none of these mapped as well to
<br>
anything useful.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, he followed up this tour-de-force with
<br>
the creation of the Libertarian Party, which was
<br>
largely a disaster for the freedom movement, as I and
<br>
many others predicted at the time.
