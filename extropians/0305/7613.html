<a href="mailto:jordan@chuma.cas.usf.edu?Subject=Re:%20Hunting">jordan@chuma.cas.usf.edu</a> writes: The problem is caused by humans, so humans 
<br>
should solve it - not by blaming animals, shooting them when they are &quot;in 
<br>
excess&quot; (humans getting to define excess, conveniently enough), etc. If 
<br>
humans try to densely occupy every square inch of this earth, the ecological 
<br>
consequences will be upon us shortly enough, along with the massive aesthetic 
<br>
losses. 
<br>
<p>gej,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you pronounce that?  It is obvious that your email was written 
<br>
to persuade -- to get us to take sides.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to tell you despite all the reasons in my background that 
<br>
indicate I should enjoy hunting and fishing I never have enjoyed those 
<br>
sports.  It is not that I have any distaste for hunting or fishing it is just 
<br>
that they have never turned me on even when I went hunting or fishing.  To me 
<br>
hunting and fishing are about as exciting as tiddly winks.  I ignore them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand I do own several books on birds, plants, animals, 
<br>
etc.and I do enjoy going out to spot birds, etc. and see if I can identify 
<br>
them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I have never seen the anti-hunters spending the kind of money 
<br>
and effort to sustain animal life that the hunters and fishermen do.  I have 
<br>
never seen you demonstrate the love of the outdoors and the wild life that 
<br>
the hunters and fishermen do.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in the Chicago, if my memory serves me properly, we have seen 
<br>
small scale starvation on the part of our deer population.  The acreage and 
<br>
population of deer was too high for trapping or other remedies and the folks 
<br>
on your side were still out there trying to forbid hunting those animals to 
<br>
avoid the animals dying in misery.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you say you could have used some kind of birth control measures.  
<br>
The truth is that around the U. S. deer do periodically have a die off 
<br>
through starvation and you do not prevent that die off.  You only show up to 
<br>
protest the animals right to die by starvation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end if you are attempting to get people to take sides I will go 
<br>
with the hunters and fishers.  I'll get out my old rusty shotgun and fishing 
<br>
rods and get right out there.  
<br>
Ron h.
