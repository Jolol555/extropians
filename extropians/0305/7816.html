<p>I would not object to this, though I might think your documentary was not
<br>
very professional if you over-used those words. 
<br>
<p>The key is that in your example you are doing a documentary. You are not in
<br>
a debate with a Nazi.

<em>&gt; Do you really disagree, do you really think the person was not an idiot?

<p>What I think about people who believe in the Easter Bunny is not the issue.
<br>
Everyone is free to think poorly of other people. Ad hominem is something
<br>
that is communicated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The word has a meaning, there must be times when it is 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the word &quot;idiot&quot; should be expunged from the English Language.
</em><br>
<p>The English dictionary is merely a collection of words that English people
<br>
use. The words &quot;idiot&quot; and &quot;moron&quot; were at one time perfectly respectable
<br>
synonyms for &quot;mentally deficient&quot; or &quot;mentally retarded.&quot; These words then
<br>
became epithets used by ill-mannered people who can't find the patience to
<br>
be civil even to those who are misinformed.
