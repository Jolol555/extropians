</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-banned AK-47 against both the bulletproof vest and the

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, the claim that a target gets damaged more by a gun with a 30
<br>
round magazine than one with a ten round magazine is about as
<br>
physically possible as a claim that UFO's are responsible for George
<br>
Bush's change in attitude toward foreign policy.
<br>
<p>Did they show the 'legal' AK-47 being shot at DIFFERENT targets, or
<br>
after the same ALREADY DAMAGED targets?
<br>
<p>Did they shoot the same number of rounds into each target? Obviously 30
<br>
rounds is going to cause more damage than 10 rounds of the same ammo.
<br>
Do you know what? I can use a 30 round magazine on legal rifles very
<br>
easily, and such magazines are entirely legal and easy to buy. So that
<br>
part of the piece was a total fraud.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, if I have three ten round magazines, I can cause just as
<br>
much damage as one thirty round magazine. Anybody who thinks it is
<br>
actually possible to stand in the open firing thirty rounds at a cop
<br>
without him getting any shots off at you, is entirely insane. Actual
<br>
military rifles like the M-16 have had their fully automatic settings
<br>
removed, replaced by just a 3 round burst setting. 3 rounds. That is
<br>
the typical number of rounds a person can shoot at one time before
<br>
their aim is entirely thrown off by recoil. So it doesn't matter
<br>
whether you have 10 or 30 rounds in your magazine. A soldier or cop is
<br>
never going to fire more than three or so rounds at a time anyways,
<br>
leaving plenty of time for replacing magazines. So that is a fraud too.
<br>
<p>But do you know what? If I shoot you at center body mass with just ONE
<br>
AK-47 round (7.62mmx39mm), legal or illegal firearm, you are dead.
<br>
Period, end of story. The ballistic energy from that round, which is
<br>
used in many different models of hunting rifle manufactured around the
<br>
world, is so high that the shock wave from the bullet destroys any
<br>
tissue within a 4 inch radius of the flight path of the bullet. So that
<br>
part of the story is a fraud too.
<br>
<p>To claim that ten bullets penetrating a bullet proof vest is somehow
<br>
safer than 30 bullets penetrating a bullet proof vest is a complete
<br>
fraud.
<br>
<p>Do know what else? When the officer claimed that his prisoners wanted
<br>
to get ahold of such rifles, he was a liar too. There are absolutely NO
<br>
prisoners in his jurisdiction convicted of attempted purchse of a
<br>
firearm by a felon. There is NO compliance with Operation Exile, and
<br>
the ONLY people who the police disarm in that community are law abiding
<br>
individuals who have had unsupported, unreviewed, uncorroborated
<br>
allegations made against them by estranged spouses, and it is done
<br>
without judicial review, without appeal. So that is a fraud too.
