</em><br>
<p>I'm going to inject some hard-core virology into this discussion
<br>
so we may be dealing with some hard core data and not speculation.
<br>
<p>Cold virus: A picornaviridae (a RNA virus) of the subtype Rhinovirus
<br>
(cold viruses) which have over 100 known serotypes -- i.e. different
<br>
variants that can evade ones existing immunological protection developed
<br>
due to prior infections.  Bottom line -- until you have caught over
<br>
100 colds and developed an immune response against them you are
<br>
vulnerable.  Their variability is one of the major reasons that a
<br>
&quot;cold vaccine&quot; is extremely difficult.
<br>
<p>[For more info: See Fields Virology, Chapters 20: Picornaviridae
<br>
and Chapter 22: Rhinoviruses].
<br>
<p>Flu (influenza) Virus:
<br>
<p>Flu is also a RNA virus classified as an orthomyxoviridae.  It
<br>
is separate from all other known viruses in that it has a
<br>
multi-segmented genome (i.e. its genomic program can exist
<br>
on 8-10 separate pieces of RNA).  This is problematic because
<br>
there are strains of Flu/Influenza that infect a variety
<br>
of other species (chickens, pigs, etc.) and an intermixing
<br>
of some combination of the common human strain with some
<br>
less common animal strain may create a strain of Flu/Influenza
<br>
that is particularly dangerous -- this is why the flu vaccines
<br>
change every year.
<br>
<p>[For more info: See Fields Virology, Chapters 39 &amp; 40
<br>
Orthomyxovirdae and Their Replication and Orthomyxoviruses]
<br>
<p>So SARS doesn't easily match either &quot;cold&quot; viruses or
<br>
&quot;flu&quot; viruses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When will an effective vaccine be available?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Considering that its genome is now sequenced, and teams are working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, I think that getting a vaccine shouldn't take more than a year or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two.
</em><br>
<p>If it does indeed turn out to be stable, this is not an unreasonable
<br>
estimate.  One of the questions that may need to be resolved is whether
<br>
it develops into a number of serotypes like the cold virus -- in which
<br>
case the vaccine alternative may be more difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Is the fatality rate due to direct action by the virus, or due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ancillary infections (that might be controlled with antibiotics)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the fatality rate is most pronounced with those over 50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (currently 55%), and that severity tends to be caused by the body's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction to the virus, I don't think that anti-biotics would help,
</em><br>
<p>This is accurate.  Anti-biotics are of little or no use.  One of the
<br>
major problems seems to be an &quot;over-reaction&quot; on the part of the body
<br>
to the infection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; though immunosuppressants might be a strategy worth pursuing, applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the infection has peaked but while the immune system is ramping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up its hyper reaction that causes deaths.
</em><br>
<p>It would seem this is the right approach -- but I haven't seen any
<br>
clear clinical data regarding what &quot;arms&quot; of the immune system response
<br>
one would want to selectively constrain.  It is a very sticky problem.

<br>
<p>FYI: if someone is talking about virology and they aren't citing this
<br>
ref then it is highly questionable whether they know what they are
<br>
speaking about.
