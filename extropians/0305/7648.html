<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, the U.N. has become quite corrupt.  Is it time for it to go?
</em><br>
<p>It might be preferrably for the UN to go. It was only as strong
<br>
as the good faith of the permanent security council members. Whether
<br>
it was moral or not there is widespread perception that the Iraq war
<br>
was illegal. (That I share that view is irrelevant. What matters I think
<br>
is that a wide variety of people who are interested in international law
<br>
-maybe not that many - also seem to be of a similar view). The 
<br>
American government is widely feared and respected but not trusted.
<br>
&nbsp;In my opinion this distrust is now endemic in the developed world as
<br>
well. To rebuild the trust it may be necessary to let the US citizens
<br>
&nbsp;(who elect the US government) see and come to understand the 
<br>
depth of unease that prevails amongst citizens of the developed world.  
<br>
<p>In my opinion the distrust is not anti-American. It is the distrust of 
<br>
the disenfranchised and the disempowered. It is the same sort of
<br>
sentiment that caused an earlier generation of Americans to go to
<br>
war to assert their rights not to be taxed (governed) without being
<br>
represented. 
<br>
<p>Personally I would have preferred President Bush to have revoked
<br>
the Charter before invading Iraq. In the long term perhaps that would
<br>
have harmed the US reputation less (the US government reputation).
<br>
In my opinion there would have been less dishonour in breaking a
<br>
treaty that was revoked on the basis of having failed in its purpose. 
<br>
Though there would still have been disagreement the hit to international
<br>
law would not have come from the worlds most powerful and probably
<br>
most advanced country.  
<br>
<p>I think it was a failure of diplomacy for Bush not to do what he said
<br>
he was going to do and to call that second security council resolution.
<br>
If the French had veto'd as they'd said they were going to and Bush
<br>
really felt the threat to security warranted it he could have threatened 
<br>
to withdraw the US from the UN as the UN would have failed in its
<br>
charter. 
<br>
<p>A dead UN version 2 (League of Nations being version 1) without
<br>
the US breaching the Charter (and dishonouring itself and bringing
<br>
distrust on itself) might have been better. Perhaps we'd at least have
<br>
&quot;level ground&quot; on which to try and rebuild international law. 
<br>
<p>Lee again
<br>
<em>&gt; However, I think that the trouble with the U.S. leaving the U.N.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be that it would play right into the hands of America's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies. &quot;See! They're so out of control that they won't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk anymore!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think the problem is worse than that now Lee. Its not that the 
<br>
US government won't talk that I think people outside of the states
<br>
fear it is that they can't be trusted when they do. Its that the US
<br>
signature on a treaty may not be worth anything. I think this
<br>
perception is now widespread amongst many of the citizens of the
<br>
developed countries of the West. I don't trust the US government 
<br>
or the Australian government). I am sure many intelligent US citizens
<br>
don't trust it either. But the level of distrust of government (especially
<br>
the powerful US goverment who doe not even have to pretend to
<br>
respect the bill of rights or constitutional rights for non US citizens) 
<br>
is in my opinion much higher than the normal background level
<br>
of government distrust. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet there comes a time when, whether it's trade negotiations or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human rights issues, Americans should indeed worry about what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the world will do.  Allowing the French and Russians to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set the standard for human rights, or allowing a lot of America-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haters to weaken international trade is not in anyone's real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest.
</em><br>
<p>No one nation can set the standards to the satisfaction of the 
<br>
nationals of a majority of other nations. This is not essentially an
<br>
american problem. Its a representation problem. Without the
<br>
UN any single powerful country disenfranchises the citizens of the
<br>
other countries. That is not a formula for stability or dare I say
<br>
&quot;extropy&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the U.S. should continue to support the same goofy charade at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.N., and hope that over time irrational hatreds subside and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperativeness and genuine humanitarianism increase.
</em><br>
<p>I think the US will. I dunno whether they should. I think we are
<br>
looking now at some quite long time periods before international 
<br>
cooperativeness and genuine humanitarianism increases. I hope 
<br>
I'm wrong.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
