<p><em>&gt; you [Mike Wiik] also wrote, &quot;He [Leo Strauss] also argued

<em>&gt; that Platonic truth is too hard for people to bear, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the classical appeal to &quot;virtue&quot; as the object of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human endeavor is unattainable.  Hence it has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to tell lies to people about the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political reality. ***An elite recognizes the truth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, and keeps it to itself. This gives it insight,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and implicitly power that others do not possess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This obviously is an important element in Strauss's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeal to America's neoconservatives.***&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;        That is straight out of the Marx-Lenin playbook.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess after 150 years most people will have forgotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it and you can pass it off as something new.
</em><br>
<p>I have to be skeptical that it can be documented that either
<br>
the Marxists or the neo-cons have actually stated things 
<br>
like &quot;truth is too hard for people to bear&quot;, and &quot;it is
<br>
necessary to tell lies&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, I am pretty sure that Lenin did say that political
<br>
power comes out of the barrel of a gun, and I'm pretty
<br>
sure that Hitler did once say something about &quot;the big
<br>
lie&quot;---but it would be nice to even have a concrete
<br>
record of that.
<br>
<p>It's also true that the Marxists conceived of an elite
<br>
in terms of &quot;the vanguard of the proletariat&quot;, but I'm
<br>
not too sure it went further---in a documentable fashion
<br>
---than that.
<br>
<p>Mike, in your reading, did you actually come across
<br>
anything where neocons can be caught actually saying
<br>
what they have been accused of, namely,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He [Leo Strauss] also argued that Platonic truth
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is too hard for people to bear, and that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classical appeal to &quot;virtue&quot; as the object of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human endeavor is unattainable.  Hence it has been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary to tell lies to people about the nature
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of political reality.&quot;
<br>
<p>This claim has all the hallmarks of propaganda.
<br>
<p>And moreover, I deeply resent the claim that the conservative
<br>
movement was unintelligent before &quot;just lately&quot;.  There were
<br>
quite highly intelligent and perceptive people who called 
<br>
themselves conservative all the way back to the 1940s.  It's
<br>
just that they had no influence in the media, and for other
<br>
reasons had a hard time getting the message out.
