<em>&gt; The reason that it seems useful to me (or, at any rate has up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until now) is that by saying &quot;He leans towards the Left&quot;, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he probably favors strict gun control
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he is probably supports a minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he probably is for socialized medicine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he was probably against the Iraq incursion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he is probably not a free market enthusiast
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he is probably tolerant of sexual deviancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he's probably in favor of increased socialism
</em><br>

<p>Political positions do tend to cluster for some
<br>
reason, as well as personality traits. The broad 
<br>
categories of left and right, etc, and the MB 
<br>
personality quadrants and subquadrants kinda
<br>
work, if you dont push the theory too hard.
<br>
<p>Why is it that so many of us extropians and 
<br>
transhumanists cluster over toward the rarest
<br>
personality types, the ENTPs and INTPs?  Even
<br>
libertarian is an oddball political position,
<br>
if you only consider the number of adherents.
<br>
If the theory is totally useless, we wouldnt
<br>
see that low-probability distribution in the
<br>
list participants.
<br>
<p>I fixed my email problem by switching from
<br>
Netscape to Microsloth Lookout.  I ordered
<br>
a new computer so I can convert this one to
<br>
Linux and see if that works any better.  I
<br>
lost some or all of the messages that were
<br>
sent in the last couple weeks, so if anyone
<br>
posted me offlist, please resend and accept
<br>
my apologies.  Damn computers.  Surely when
<br>
we approach the singularity, some panicky 
<br>
sub-AI will start to barf viruses faster 
<br>
than we can identify and fix them.
