</em><br>
<p>This is true, but also a bit narrow. Having leisure time (which is somewhat 
<br>
debatable in HG societies; much of the time is spent waiting) does not 
<br>
produce any parthenon - none were built by the gorillas or human HGs. That it 
<br>
is impossible to prove progressivism doesn't make it a bad hypothesis, just 
<br>
as it is impossible to prove a lot of history but it is still most likely 
<br>
true or at least a reasonable account. 
<br>
<p>Maybe one could use Rojas negative technology determinism: technology doesn't 
<br>
determine society, but it determines the space of possible societies at any 
<br>
point in time. With agriculture larger populations, economies of scale and 
<br>
cities became possible, which in turn allow division of labor, a warrior 
<br>
class and culture and so on. These are roads that need not have been taken 
<br>
by all people, but many hold such benefits (for genes and memes) that those 
<br>
who take them will dominate the others. 
<br>
<p>Meanwhile HGs do not have much advantages of scale and technological 
<br>
development was limited - a better way of catching food means that there will 
<br>
be less of it in the long run rather than more. Hence they are essentially 
<br>
locked into their technology as long as they retain the same lifestyle. 
<br>
<p>I think progressivism works on the large scale, when we treat human history 
<br>
as statistical mechanics rather than look at individual people or regions. On 
<br>
the large scale we see how a growing humanity creates a situation where it 
<br>
competes with itself on a variety of levels, spurring a massive co-evolution 
<br>
of technology, culture, population and economy. Locally things are far more 
<br>
complex and can move in many different ways. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One might even argue that extropianism is a philosophical attempt to prepare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an escape from the doomed world we created at the advent of agriculture. 
</em><br>
<p>That is the negative way of seeing it. The positive way of seeing it is that 
<br>
extropianism is a philosophical attempt to breach the shell of the seed-pod 
<br>
and grow into a tree.
