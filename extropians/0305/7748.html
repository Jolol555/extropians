<em>&gt; &gt; To me, the choice of no international body, and a set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decentralized, individual, sovereign states is clearly superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to  the choice repesented by the UN.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one happens to be an American citizen, that could well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rational choice for the short term. But in the long term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think fortess America can work any better than fortress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rome, or Athens etc. 
</em><br>
<p>Fortress Rome didn't work because the legions became dominated by
<br>
troops who were not Romans, plus Romans fought the same way against
<br>
their neighbors for so long that their neighbors finally figured out
<br>
how to best the Roman military method.
<br>
<p>Fortress Athens never was. As the Delphi Oracle said, the only walls
<br>
that Athens could trust were wooden walls, meaning it's navy. This
<br>
worked fine enough until Athens exiled its best general, Alcibiades, to
<br>
Sparta, and taught Lysander the value and necessity of a navy, who won
<br>
the Pelopponesian War for Sparta.
<br>
<p>Fortress America worked fine for a couple centuries as well. We had an
<br>
ocean on either side to isolate us from the corruption, hypocrisy, back
<br>
stabbing, double dealing, and lying horse-theivery that was weltpolitik
<br>
in the more 'civilized' nations.
<br>
<p>Given the threat of total war and atomic weapons in 1945, we could no
<br>
longer rely on two oceans to give us time to mobilize in the rare event
<br>
that we could not avoid getting involved in other peoples messes. Pax
<br>
Americana has been in effect for more than a half century already. Its
<br>
a little late for y'all to be complaining about it, especially those
<br>
who have done quite right by it.
<br>
<p>Given the exponentially decreasing costs of waging war by mass
<br>
destruction, we can also no longer avoid imposing our values on the
<br>
rest of the world. Y'all asked for it, you wanted to tango. As Niven
<br>
said of what the Kzin learned, those human monkeys don't like playing
<br>
war because they got so damn good at it. Well, now you get to learn at
<br>
the foot of the master.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think American's want to trade, they want to travel. So some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international laws do seem to be necessary and in the interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Americans.  
</em><br>
<p>International laws regarding trade and travel existed long before the
<br>
UN was a figment in anyones imagination (UN I OR UN II), and they will
<br>
continue to exist long after UN III is a dim memory. You don't need a
<br>
UN to enforce international laws, all you need is signor states willing
<br>
to enforce them with naval and air power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you want to propose  another choice, you'll have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convince me that it's better than that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have the answers. I wish I did. I have a suspicion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we may now have to ditch the illusion that was the UN to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with a sort of UN version 3 (in American's interests too).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What bothers me is how long that is likely to take. 
</em><br>
<p>Depends on how coy France decides to get, don't you think? The only
<br>
time it seems you can get them to the table is when their own national
<br>
survival is at stake. Europe, for that matter, is chock full of
<br>
countries with wounded pride and inflated ideas of their own importance
<br>
in the world.
