<p>Let me add that at this point we should be asking why did the WHO, CDC,
<br>
and the media play down fatality rate of SARS by using this obviously
<br>
flawed estimation method? It was clear to me when I posted a message to
<br>
this list on April 24 on the SARS topic that the fatality rate had to be
<br>
closer to 20% than 5%, yet everyone accepted and quoted the official
<br>
figure without any misgiving. Instead, we saw media &quot;skepticism&quot; in the
<br>
*other direction*, playing down the severity of the problem.
<br>
<p>I think part of the problem is that local public health authorities and
<br>
even the WHO all have incentives to under-report problems. For the local
<br>
authorities, the costs of being transparent (decline of tourism and
<br>
foreign investments) are local, while the benefits (preventing
<br>
transmission to other countries) are global. The WHO doesn't have this
<br>
particular problem but it depends on local authorities for data and for
<br>
access, and can't afford to antagonize them.
<br>
<p>However, I still don't understand why &quot;skepticism&quot; in the private media is
<br>
also in the direction of minimizing the problem, or have I just missed
<br>
the skeptical articles on the other side? Does anyone remember seeing any
<br>
articles before May 7 suggesting that the official fatality rate was too
<br>
low?
