I did some googling to learn more about the increase
<br>
in tornados, and found this article from Science News,
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/20020511/bob9.asp">http://www.sciencenews.org/20020511/bob9.asp</a>.  In my experience they
<br>
are generally a good, objective magazine.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meteorologists have reliable, comprehensive statistics only for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tornadoes during the past 50 years or so, says Joseph T. Schaefer,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Center in Norman, Okla. The number of twisters reported from year to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year is highly variable. Over the decades, however, the average number
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been increasing by a dozen or so each year. In the 1960s, there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were about 650 twisters reported annually. In the 1990s, the average
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was more than 1,100. Schaefer discussed this finding at the annual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meeting of the American Meteorological Society in Orlando last January.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's causing the proliferation? &quot;It's probably not climate change,&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says Schaefer. &quot;It's people change.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As people move out of cities and disperse over larger areas, they are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more likely to spot tornadoes. As increasing media coverage makes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;travelers and residents of suburbs and exurbs more weather-aware,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are more likely to report twisters. The growing popularity of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cellular phones, which enable people on the road or in areas of downed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phone lines to call in sightings to emergency centers, will probably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue to fuel the apparent increase, Schaefer speculates.
<br>
<p>Now, this is just one man's opinion, but he is apparently a well qualified
<br>
expert with the National Weather Service.
<br>
<p>I found some tornado statistics at the NOAA web site.  The 2000-2003 data
<br>
is at <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/monthlytornstats.html">http://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/monthlytornstats.html</a>,
<br>
with stats back to the 1950s available at
<br>
<a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/ustdbmy.html">http://www.spc.noaa.gov/archive/tornadoes/ustdbmy.html</a>.  Interestingly,
<br>
although there is an increasing trend as mentioned above, and the first
<br>
ten days of May, 2003 were the worst for tornados in decades, 2002 was
<br>
actually quite a low year, the lowest since 1988.  There is considerable
<br>
fluctuation in the numbers, but last year was quite unusual considering
<br>
the trend.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I know it's much more fun to go back and argue about who said
<br>
what, and on whom the burden of proof currently lies.  Let me know when
<br>
you get that figured out - I can't wait!
