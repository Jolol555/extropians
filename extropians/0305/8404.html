<p>
For those who still claim the media isn't biased, here is a hot off the
<br>
presses event showing their active bias and how they try to rewrite
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>Thursday night, CNN broadcast a piece on the Assault Weapons Ban,
<br>
because it is coming up for renewal, as it is set to expire in 2004 if
<br>
not renewed this year, and it appears that congress is not going to
<br>
renew it. CNN presented a very distorted view of 'assault weapons', of
<br>
the law, and of law enforcement's opinion of the law.
<br>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0305/15/se.13.html">http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0305/15/se.13.html</a>
<br>
<p>LAST night, Friday, they had NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre on for
<br>
an interview about their piece of the previous day. Wayne read them the
<br>
riot act about how distorted and fraudulent it was, based on lies and
<br>
propaganda. He said, &quot;The only difference between CNN and the New York
<br>
Times is that when a Times reporter lies, they fire him. CNN should
<br>
fire the reporter and producer who produced this piece.&quot; The
<br>
anchorwoman insisted that CNN stood by its piece and its staff.
<br>
LaPierre continued to lambaste CNN, to the point that the host
<br>
threatened to take him off the air if he didn't shut up.
<br>
<p>Well, today I went looking at CNN.com for a transcript of that show.
<br>
They have the transcript for every OTHER show broadcast that day, as
<br>
well as all the shows broadcast so far TODAY, BUT there is no
<br>
transcript of the LaPierre interview. It is like it never happened. CNN
<br>
is trying to rewrite history by selecting what broadcasts become part
<br>
of the permanent record online, and selecting what broadcasts the
<br>
public has access to after the fact.
<br>
<p>If this is not proof positive of the radical left wing agenda at work
<br>
at CNN, their lack of journalistic integrity, and willingness to
<br>
distort and misrepresent the truth, then the term has no meaning.
