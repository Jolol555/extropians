<em>&gt;&gt; From this we might infer that superrationality is what you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; when you extrapolate any more limited concept of rational behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to a timeless setting. This seems particularly apropos to extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; who hope and plan to live forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I think I know what you are saying.  Certainly if in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-iterated Prisoners Dilemma I begin to suspect that the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; player is myself, either a freshly minted duplicate or a self from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another time, then my incentive to Defect vanishes.  (Because I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee Corbin getting benefit no matter &quot;who&quot; wins.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now then, timelessness also invites one to confuse a present setting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with members of the set of all equivalent settings.  I shall refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the atavistic axioms of Kolmogorov, (which are all that I believed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until indoctrinated by the present ilk of Bayesians who infest these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists).  My interpretation of Kolmogorov axioms were just this: say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has tossed a die high into the air, and then just as it hit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table, slapped a hat on top of it so that one cannot see the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the die has assumed.  Then on the one hand we accept that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die has assumed a definite value (and is not really in any sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superposition of all six possibilities).  My interpretation of the K
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms was that we are invited to deliberately confuse the present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances with all those other historical cases in which a die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been tossed (Kolmogorov's &quot;class G&quot;).  Then from this vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sample, the theoretical fraction of instances in which the &quot;six&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showing is one-sixth! And thus we have probability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is possible that you meant something like this by your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;timelessness&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>No, that's not really what I meant.  See below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for superrationality itself---as originally defined by Hofstadter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and others---it's merely the mistaken doctrine that one should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cooperate in the non-iterated Prisoners Dilemma under the normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions that the adversary is not a version of oneself (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore has behavior completely uncorrelated with one), and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is not an altruist.  The values in the Table say &quot;Defect&quot;, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that that is all there is to it (given the Totally correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assessment of the non-Repeatability of the PD).
</em><br>
<p>Prisoners Dilemma is considered a paradox because at the level within which
<br>
is it discussed by game theorists, it shows two fully aware and rational
<br>
players choosing to defect (they both lose) when they could have easily
<br>
chosen to cooperate (they both win.)
<br>
<p>As with all paradox, the problem is seeing things at too low a level,
<br>
isolated from other relevant factors.  In the real world, our actions *are*
<br>
correlated, and we can expect (more or less) that others will choose as we
<br>
choose.  As we interact over time, correlation only increases, so the
<br>
success of superrational decision-making becomes increasingly probable as we
<br>
approach &quot;timelessness&quot;.
<br>
<p>It seems that superrationality is very similar to the &quot;altruism&quot; humans
<br>
speak of.  The key to understanding it is the proper context level.
<br>
<p>Hmmm, weren't we here about a year ago?
