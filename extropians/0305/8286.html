<br>
throw away a lightning rod after it has been hit.  Our &quot;ground&quot; is composed 
<br>
mostly of sand.  The lightning melts the sand around the end of the lightning 
<br>
rod and creates a glass insulator around it.  Such a lightning rod won't work 
<br>
again and has to be replaced.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This not in direct response to your story but is something you 
<br>
reminded me of.  I was raised on a cotton farm near New Madrid, Mo. where the 
<br>
huge earthquake occurred in 1812 AD.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe most outsiders wouldn't think about it but when an earthquake 
<br>
shakes a place like ours was it forces ground water to gush to the surface 
<br>
bringing sand with it.  Consequently in that area we have a lot of black 
<br>
topsoil dotted with patches of sand.  The &quot;sand blows&quot; can vary from a few 
<br>
feet across to a patch covering couple of hundred acres -- I believe that is 
<br>
the largest one known.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One summer day it was probably 95 degrees and for once was extremely 
<br>
dry despite the entire area being a multi state swamp.  My father had 
<br>
finished cultivating his crops and was broke.  For 8 months he had been 
<br>
pouring his money into gasoline for his equipment, seed, hired help, and all 
<br>
the stuff a farmer needs to make a crop.  The garden was producing so we had 
<br>
food.  But it would be a month before the harvest began and the money begin 
<br>
to flow in.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop had one recreation open to him.  He loved to listen to the St. 
<br>
Louis Cardinals on the family radio -- this was pre TV and even pre 
<br>
electricity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came into the house and sat by the radio.  He turned on the set but 
<br>
the battery was too low for him to listen comfortably.  That battery was 
<br>
about gone and I knew he had no money for a new one.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought fast and said, &quot;Dad, stay there.  I'll think I can fix it.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked kind of doubtful but settled back to wait.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went outside and in no more than five minutes I was back inside to 
<br>
collect my father's approval -- I could hear that radio blaring easily from 
<br>
anywhere in our yard.  Teenage boys just love being their Dad's Golden Haired 
<br>
Boy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what I had done.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of you have already figured it out but for the technically 
<br>
challenged -- I had remembered that our house sat on the edge of a sand blow. 
<br>
&nbsp;The ground wire for the radio was driven into the driest sand you can 
<br>
imagine.  I had grabbed a bucket of water and poured it on the ground wire.
