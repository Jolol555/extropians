<p>Very interesting and well thought-out article.  However, I disagree with
<br>
your &quot;problem&quot; of the clustering of political beliefs.  You seem to explain
<br>
that unrelated beliefs are group together in an irrational way, but this is
<br>
hard to prove.  I submit that there is a rational (although not necessarily
<br>
accurate) reason for these groupings.
<br>
<p>For example, under &quot;correlations of political beliefs with non-cognitive
<br>
traits&quot;, you state that &quot;Members of minorities are much more likely to
<br>
support affirmative action than white men are. The poor are much more likely
<br>
than the rich to believe in wealth-redistribution (welfare, etc.) Members of
<br>
the entertainment industry are much more likely to be liberal than
<br>
conservative.  None of these trends would be expected if political beliefs
<br>
had a solely, or even primarily, cognitive origin.&quot;
<br>
<p>I submit that these are all rational, selfish, self-preservation traits.
<br>
All of these groups are selfishly arguing for political views that will
<br>
benefit their own particular group.  This seems perfectly rational and
<br>
consistent to me.
<br>
<p>Another example you cite, under &quot;the clustering of political beliefs&quot;, you
<br>
state that logically unrelated beliefs are correlated.  &quot;For example, people
<br>
who support gun control are much more likely to support welfare programs and
<br>
abortion rights.&quot;  This is a consistent group of beliefs for social workers
<br>
who work with people below the poverty line.  Such people believe these
<br>
people's access to guns should be limited, while their access to welfare and
<br>
abortions should be increased.  This seems perfectly rational and consistent
<br>
to me within this small subset of people.
<br>
<p>Another example you cite, &quot;one would naively expect that those who support
<br>
animal rights would be far more likely to oppose abortion than those who
<br>
reject the notion of animal rights.&quot;  This is only true for super-rational
<br>
atheists.  For God-fearing Christians who take the Bible literally, they
<br>
both are explained by the religious belief in a soul.  Animals don't have
<br>
souls, so they don't get any rights.  A fetus gets a soul at conception and
<br>
therefore has rights.  This seems perfectly rational and consistent to me
<br>
within the religious belief system of Christianity.
<br>
<p>Another example was affirmative action and abortion.  I would say both are
<br>
tools useful to minorities.  It is consistent that they would desire both of
<br>
these things.
<br>
<p>You also list &quot;affirmative action is just, abortion is permissible, welfare
<br>
programs are good, capital punishment is bad, human beings are seriously
<br>
damaging the environment, &quot; as being a set of liberal beliefs, but you
<br>
question why there would be a set of people holding the opposite views.
<br>
This seems to be obviously divided by socio-economic class.  People above a
<br>
certain line aren't threatened by any of these issues even if they occur.
<br>
People below a certain line are disproportionately threatened by all these
<br>
items and cannot afford relief.  This is an obvious dividing line:  those
<br>
who won't be harmed by these problems don't want to expend resources to fix
<br>
them, those who will be harmed by these problems do want to expend resources
<br>
to fix them.  Again, it seems totally consistent with rational self-interest
<br>
in all cases.  I see no inconsistency or irrationality on any sides.
<br>
<p>Your discussion on &quot;Rational Ignorance&quot; seems to hit the nail on the head
<br>
for me.  People don't bother investigating possibilities that might work
<br>
against them.  They support causes that will benefit their group.  They
<br>
oppose causes that will not benefit their group.  They work hard finding
<br>
information to support their positions.  They do not work hard finding
<br>
information that refutes their position.  This seems to be the root cause of
<br>
all politics.  People selfishly choose what they want to believe, and then
<br>
only pay attention to data that supports their goals.
<br>
<p>All of your reasons stated under &quot;Sources of Belief Preferences&quot; seem
<br>
correct to me.  I just don't see what any of that has to do with being
<br>
irrational.  People are selfish and choose ideas for their own purposes
<br>
rather than what is actually true.  This seems to me to be a consistent and
<br>
rational strategy.  But it is a political strategy for gaining more
<br>
resources, not for discerning truth.
<br>
<p>In summary, I don't disagree with your paper.  However, I think it more
<br>
directly boils down to people's motives.  If they want to be selfish,
<br>
compete and get more for themselves, the common political bickering seems to
<br>
be the way to do it.  If they want to be scientific, logical, and seek out
<br>
truth, then this seems incompatible with politics.
