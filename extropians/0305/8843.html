(statistical and otherwise) that would be involved in trying to use this result as

<br>
<p>Eliezer,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I am the humorless jerk.  The references I checked all seemed to 
<br>
have a political ax to grind.  I suppose it is a possible statistical fallacy 
<br>
of sorts, but I plainly remember during the Kennedy and Johnson years when my 
<br>
conservative friends used to show me pieces like what the Google search 
<br>
turned up.  The difference was that instead of Bush being the whipping boy, the 
<br>
whipping boys were Kennedy-Johnson.  I am saying that seems to be a function of 
<br>
who is President.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezar, I was stationed in the Bermuda Islands during parts of 1954 
<br>
and 1955.  As I was in a seaplane squadron we got a round up and down the East 
<br>
Coast.  That is the best and safest flying duty I can imagine.  There are no 
<br>
serious weather problems except when a hurricane comes along.  When that 
<br>
happens we simply left the area.  At over 170 knots per hour we could outrun the 
<br>
hurricanes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However during that time we might have had a half dozen incidents that 
<br>
ended up in &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; books that I had personal knowledge of the 
<br>
facts.  In not one case was the incident reported even half way accurately in the 
<br>
books.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you might guess, for me to have knowledge of so many, there is 
<br>
something I am not telling you.  To get the number so high most of the reported 
<br>
incidents happened well outside the Bermuda Triangle.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am hinting is that with &quot;Presidential Crime Families&quot; and the 
<br>
&quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; there seems to be a cottage industry of unscrupulous writers 
<br>
that gin out these books and articles.  There doesn't seem to be enough 
<br>
gullible readers to make those writers well to do.  So I guess that is a good 
<br>
thing.

<p>BTW, Our squadron was assigned to anti submarine warfare with Soviet subs as 
<br>
the designated bad guys.  Since, it has been revealed that we had and still 
<br>
have a long range sonar that provides an underwater fence.  That fence sections 
<br>
off the North Atlantic and provided such control that we were able to follow 
<br>
Soviet subs across the Atlantic a little more uncertainly than an airliner 
<br>
going across country on Instrument flight rules.  One day the famous horn blew and 
<br>
the announcement, &quot;This is not a drill&quot; followed immediately.  The duty crew 
<br>
ran for the duty airplane.  A bunch of guys showed up to shove that seaplane 
<br>
over the side of the island (down a ramp) and away went the plane with bombs, 
<br>
etc., armed and ready.  The stand by crew and aircraft immediately prepared to 
<br>
react if called.  Word was passed around that a Soviet Sub was spotted close 
<br>
to our East Coast in an area where he was not supposed to penetrate without our 
<br>
knowing he was there.  Our long range sonar had said there was no such boat.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and by our plane returned.  We pulled it up the ramp and 
<br>
immediately fell upon our buddies in the duty crew to learn what they had discovered.  
<br>
The mysterious spotting was a drifting rowboat.  We had a good laugh and forgot 
<br>
it.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank God the guys that write the Bermuda Triangle books never heard 
<br>
the story or we would have an invader from Mars that morphed into a Soviet Sub 
<br>
and then into a row boat until the coast was clear.  &lt;G&gt;  On the other hand it 
<br>
might have all been part of the Eisenhower Criminal Family.
