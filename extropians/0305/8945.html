<p>
I agree almost 100% with Mez's analysis of the movie, having also seen
<br>
it a second time.  In particular, I totally agree that there is no
<br>
&quot;nested matrix&quot; concept here.  In addition to the reasons Mez cites,
<br>
I would also point out that it's been done before (The Thirteenth Floor)
<br>
and is a tired and hackneyed cliche by modern standards.  Neo's &quot;power&quot;
<br>
in the real world appears restricted to some control over the machines
<br>
that are part of the Matrix system, and it cost him dearly, totally
<br>
unlike his powers in the Matrix.  Note that this may have been Neo's first
<br>
interaction with Sentinels since he became the One, so that transformation
<br>
may have granted him this power, or else it may be that his interaction
<br>
with the Architect was the key.
<br>
<p>I do want to say a little more about the philosophy of the movie, and
<br>
put a slightly different emphasis on Mez's comments.  IMO the key point
<br>
of the movie is mentioned in an almost offhand way by the Architect,
<br>
so that I totally missed it on the first showing: that the Matrix only
<br>
works because people have a choice to accept it.  Every person in the Matrix
<br>
is aware at some level that it is a simulation.  Most people, over 99%,
<br>
accept it anyway.  Only a few reject it.
<br>
<p>This is why we see Neo being so unhappy in the beginning of the first
<br>
movie.  On that first meeting with Trinity, they discuss the question
<br>
which drives him: &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;  It was a puzzle not resolved
<br>
at that time - how did Neo know that there was a Matrix?  How did he
<br>
know that it was called the Matrix?  How did he know this question but
<br>
not have any understanding about the answer?
<br>
<p>It is clear, now, that every human being is presented at a subconscious
<br>
level with the truth about the world, and probably the name, the Matrix.
<br>
They don't have conscious access to it.  But those who cannot accept
<br>
the idea of living in a simulation are like Neo: driven, unhappy,
<br>
unsatisfied, convinced that there is something wrong with the world.
<br>
(Of course it doesn't hurt dramatically that most of us have experienced
<br>
similar feelings of alienation as we go through adolescence.)  One way or
<br>
the other, most of those people eventually find their way out of the Matrix.
<br>
<p>Maybe some of them just wake up, screaming, in those pods, and die when
<br>
they are flushed into the drainage system.  But some are rescued and
<br>
taken to Zion.  Zion is the safety valve, the pressure release, for the Matrix.
<br>
<p>And this points out a problem which was left unsettled at the end of the
<br>
first movie: what can Neo do?  Imagine six billion people awakening in
<br>
their pods as the simulation shuts down.  No scenario could prevent the
<br>
deaths of virtually all of them.
<br>
<p>This is why I agree with Mez that the resolution of the movie will
<br>
involve some form of continuance of the Matrix simulation.  The clues
<br>
that he lists clearly indicate that man/machine symbiosis is the path to
<br>
the future.  To this end, we have to ask: what is wrong with the Matrix?
<br>
Why does it need to be fixed?  How can it be fixed in a dramatically
<br>
satisfying manner?
<br>
<p>It's not even clear that the actions of the AIs in continuing the Matrix
<br>
are unethical, given that people are at least subconsciously agreeing
<br>
to participate.  The alternative, turning everyone lose on a barren
<br>
Earth where nothing grows, would be mass murder.
<br>
<p>However from an Extropian perspective the problem is clear: the humans
<br>
are not able to reach their potential.  They are limited and restricted
<br>
in a world which is managed by machines, presumably a relatively static
<br>
world where there is no real technological progress.
<br>
<p>So what I foresee is that the simulation will be altered, people will
<br>
be given greater freedom and flexibility, and be allowed to take greater
<br>
control over their destinies.  They will still live in the Matrix, but they
<br>
will be able to grow.  At least, this is what I'd like to see.  However it
<br>
is also possible that the filmmakers will find it necessary to put people
<br>
back onto the newly re-greened surface of the earth.
<br>
<p>I also think that Smith will play a part but in a different way than
<br>
Mez predicts.  Smith will not be defeated, but converted.  It is clear
<br>
now that the Agents are only a subset of the machine programs living
<br>
in the Matrix.  They are clearly nothing more than security guards,
<br>
bouncers, thugs with little imagination, designed purely as muscle.
<br>
The other programs we see are far more colorful and imaginative.
<br>
But Smith has been transformed, and I think in the end we will see a
<br>
partnership between Neo and Smith that mirrors on a personal level the
<br>
new symbiosis between human and machine.
<br>
<p>Back to the philosophy, I felt that the key issue in this movie was choice
<br>
versus predestination.  What does it mean to choose, if there are machines
<br>
around who can predict your choices?  The oracle offers an answer, and I
<br>
believe the Merovingean may have said the same thing: that the key is to
<br>
understand why you made the choice.  Now, I'm not sure this makes sense,
<br>
emotionally or philosophically; if we really had machines around which
<br>
could predict our actions, would we take consolation in a philosphical
<br>
effort to gain deeper self-understanding?
<br>
<p>Anyway, it is because of this reasoning that I do think the Architect was
<br>
referring to the Oracle as the program who was built to understand and
<br>
model human thinking, the one who came up with the idea of using human
<br>
choice as the key to the stability of the Matrix.  In fact, I think this
<br>
is the main power of the Oracle: to predict human choices.  And she does
<br>
this on the basis of a deep and detailed understanding of human beings.
<br>
This is why she advises the same course to others, that they try to gain
<br>
the level of understanding of themselves that she has of them.
<br>
<p>One of the puzzles I don't fully understand is the actions and motivations
<br>
of the Architect.  Why did he tell Neo about Trinity being in danger,
<br>
knowing that it would cause him to reject the deal to save the Matrix?
<br>
It seems quite clear that he anticipated Neo's decision; he could see
<br>
it coming a mile away.  The Architect mentioned that Neo was different
<br>
from his predecessors in another way, besides those that Mez listed:
<br>
the earlier Ones had a love of humanity; but Neo was the first to be in
<br>
love with an individual.  It was this which ultimately made him choose
<br>
differently than his predecessors.
<br>
<p>I can see two possible reasons.  The Architect has reluctantly accepted
<br>
the necessity of allowing human choice as an element in creating a stable
<br>
Matrix.  It may be that this requirement extends to the One as well.
<br>
The One must make a choice in order for the Matrix to survive, and so
<br>
perhaps the Architect was compelled to give Neo the information needed
<br>
to make an informed choice.
<br>
<p>A more interesting possibility is that the Architect was dissatisfied with
<br>
the cyclical nature of the Matrix.  It seems that the events leading up
<br>
to Neo's meeting with the Architect were quite uncertain and difficult.
<br>
It's possible that if things had happened differently, the meeting might
<br>
not have happened and the simulation been destroyed.  This suggests
<br>
that the Architect may be looking for a better and more stable Matrix.
<br>
Perhaps he is taking the chance that this time, things will be different,
<br>
and that out of the ashes of the current system he can construct a
<br>
new simulation that will not have the same flaws as the present one.
<br>
This would suggest that he was lying, or at least exaggerating, about
<br>
the outcome if Neo chooses to rescue Trinity, that there will be in fact
<br>
some way to save the human race and the AIs which depend on them.
<br>
<p>I didn't find it particularly credible when he suggested that the AIs were
<br>
prepared to let the humans die and themselves remain functional only at
<br>
a very low level.  This is a precise mirror of the discussion Neo had
<br>
with the Councilman in the engineering level, when they talked about
<br>
smashing the machines that kept Zion alive, just because they could.
<br>
The humans would never commit such folly, and I can't believe that the
<br>
machines would, either.
