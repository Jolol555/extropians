<em>&gt; &gt; I believe the socialists got term by going back and taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it from the founding fathers in the American Revolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If so that is a clear case of using a label to attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conceal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it is more likely that socialists and communists and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazis were probably more misguided then deliberately dishonest. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans usually tend to believe in what they are doing, no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how obviously wrong it seems to others.  Where disagreements arise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is human nature to assume the other side is deliberately being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonest.  &quot;Never attribute to conspiracy that which is adequately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained by stupidity.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I am more likely to assume that true conspiracies are not the 
<br>
norm and successful ones are fairly rare.  I do however believe with Gatto we 
<br>
can often explain events by referring to people with a shared bias.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of socialists adopting the term liberal.  I believe anyone 
<br>
reading von Hayek's Road to Serfdom will find his discussion of how the 
<br>
socialists in the 19th century adopted the term liberal to cover their true 
<br>
colors.  He lays out events at some length.  As to their taking it from our 
<br>
founding fathers and that era that was only my speculation.  However until 
<br>
the socialists adopted the term I believe &quot;Liberal&quot; was held in good repute.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the lower levels I can easily accept that communists, socialists 
<br>
and Nazis or Italian Fascists were only misguided.  However at the highest 
<br>
level my reading of history is that the communists and nazis were a criminal 
<br>
organization bent on taking over a country to their own aggrandisement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, I wrote the 1st paragraph you quoted but I believe you will find 
<br>
someone else wrote the second paragraph -- and very well too.
