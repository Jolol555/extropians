<em>&gt; Oh, yes, of course.  But these are entirely separate meanings
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>IME the concepts are not so much linked as confused every day.  If people who
<br>
are right-wing and conservative are offended by the media and call it liberal,
<br>
it's not clear which sense they're actually using.  Liberal the US political
<br>
complex or liberal the mindset and attitude?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The liberals are plenty resistant to change when they've been running things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for enough decades  ;-)  and the conservatives are *eager* for change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that very same case.  While it's very true that many conservatives are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;broad- minded&quot; on social issues, (American) liberals tend to be narrow on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic issues, wishing to deny quite a few freedoms.
</em><br>
<p>And this use of 'liberal' gets weird when put next to 'liberal' and
<br>
'liberalising' in international news.  Gephardt's protectionist, right?  And
<br>
perhaps not super-left in some social matters.  Compare to Milton Friedman,
<br>
who in 1963 at least was still calling himself a liberal, refusing to
<br>
surrender the classical meaning of the term.  History was on his side, but
<br>
these days he'd be called a conservative, or a libertarian if he was lucky,
<br>
and Gephardt would be the liberal, and I protest.
<br>
<p>Our language would be enriched if 'liberal' and 'conservative' weren't used as
<br>
bad synonyms for 'left-wing' and 'right-wing', not that those are totally
<br>
clear terms either.  Cf. the neo-cons, considered right-wing, and by rights
<br>
highly offensive to any small-government and isolationist 'conservative'.  Or
<br>
the War on Drugs, although to be fair that's supported by left and right,
<br>
opposed (at least tentatively) by conservative Henry Hyde because because of
<br>
its erosion of property rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes.  I was as confused (I claim) as your friend is when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was about 14 and thought that conservation efforts must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good because it was semantically linked to &quot;conservative&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I reversed it -- &quot;conservatives should be for conservation, right?&quot;  And
<br>
aristocratic landowners do actually have some tendency to take the long view
<br>
on land managemant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And see Communists in the Soviet Union being &quot;conservative&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vs. &quot;liberal&quot; free market reformers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes; on the political *spectrum*, the free market reformers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were the more conservative.  But as resists change, of course,
</em><br>
<p>On what spectrum were they more conservative?  Ours?  Why are they even being
<br>
called conservative anymore?  What are they conserving?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And here you must mean &quot;mainstream media&quot;, because both cable
</em><br>
<p>Probably.  I wasn't worrying about it much, having little exposure to
<br>
non-print/non-PBS sources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I will note again that lefties don't think mass media is leftie.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many must have their eyes shut---much in the way gts is saying that viewers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and promoters of Fox News think it to be balanced.  Go figure.
</em><br>
<p>Well, for example, PBS is no shining bastion of liberalism.  I don't know
<br>
about NPR, but on TV we've got the Lehrer News Hour, which tries to offend no
<br>
one and fails to ask hard questions and usually doesn't strongly left wing
<br>
people (or so my parents say) and the McLaughlin Group, which used to be
<br>
pretty right wing.  Bill Moyers is fairly left I guess, but his edginess seems
<br>
to be a fairly recent development.
<br>
<p>What's interesting is McLaughlin, who used to lampoon Clinton and other
<br>
lefties, and has guests tending to be right than left, including Pat Buchanan
<br>
and Fred Barnes as regulars, but apparently has become much more serious and
<br>
critical of Bush.  At least two of his regulars are obnoxious (dumb and
<br>
simplistic, at least to me) right wingers, not sure about the third, but the
<br>
liberal Eleanor gets more sympathy from him and he seems more contemptuous of
<br>
the others, while criticizing the war and the war on drugs.
<br>
<p>All of which is *very* weird for me to see over winter break while remembering
<br>
seeing him week in after week out ten years ago and wondering why we were
<br>
putting up with his crap.
<br>
<p>I guess Frontline is liberal/left too.  Still, the impression I get from my
<br>
parents is that while PBS might be left-biased its mostly vapid and cowardly
<br>
and afraid of offending its corporate sponsors.
