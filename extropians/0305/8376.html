<em>&gt; &gt; I have to be skeptical that it can be documented that either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Marxists or the neo-cons have actually stated things like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;truth is too hard for people to bear&quot;, and &quot;it is necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to tell lies&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe those points could be documented if someone had the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest.  Now grant me that I consider the communists/Marxist/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leninist/socialist to be simply differing point on a single 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuum.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Again if you re-read your Hayek I am pretty sure you will find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific references to not being forthright with the masses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the leaders intentions.  I recall the former Soviet Ambassador 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Washington's wife speaking on the subject -- Alexsandra ??
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can understand your skepticism, but consider would a group of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaders that killed their citizenry by the millions stop at lying?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think not.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, there is no question whatsoever that the more tyrannical
<br>
the regime, the more lies.  But what I meant was, is there
<br>
any *necessary* part of Marxist or Neo-con *doctrine* that
<br>
endorses lies?  It wouldn't even surprise me to learn that
<br>
Lenin himself, when first steeped in Marxism, believed that
<br>
it would be possible for the leaders of the new revolution
<br>
to be completely truthful.  It was only as he acquired power
<br>
that his idealism had to desert him as he encountered practical
<br>
obstacles.

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; that Platonic truth...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I didn't write that. I quoted from the IHT article. I cut'n'pasted it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I supposed that that had been understood by the members
<br>
of this conversation, but you are entirely correct to point
<br>
out that this was not actually your claim.  Sorry.
<br>
<p>The truth is,
<br>
<p>Mike Wiik wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [William Pfaff IHT in &lt;The long reach of Leo Strauss&gt; wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Leo Strauss argued that Platonic truth is too hard for people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to bear, and that the classical appeal to &quot;virtue&quot; as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; object of human endeavor is unattainable.  Hence it has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessary to tell lies to people about the nature of political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reality.
</em><br>
<p>and so, when all is said and done, we have William Pfaff claiming
<br>
that Leo Strauss argued that lies must be told.
<br>
<p>Now I could credit that Leo Strauss might recognize that as a
<br>
practical matter when influencing debate, especially if your
<br>
side is in the saddle, you may have to tell lies, or at least,
<br>
that it is greatly in your best interest to do so.  (This is
<br>
why most governments on Earth lie to their people, though
<br>
not systematically so in non-tyrannies.)
<br>
<p>But I do *not* credit that lying is a part of Neo-con, or even
<br>
Nazi philosophy.  I simply have never heard of any ideology
<br>
that cynical.
