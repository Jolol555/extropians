<p><em>&gt; This right-left liberal- conservative thing has always confused me,

conservatives are
<br>

abortions but what
<br>
<em>&gt; does one have to do with the other? It's the same with wanting rigid anti
</em><br>
drug laws and 
<br>
<em>&gt; school vouchers too, I just don't see why it has to be a package deal.
</em><br>
Liberals have a '
<br>
<em>&gt; similar problem, if you want fewer restrictions on pornography you must be
</em><br>
a liberal and 
<br>
<em>&gt; want more welfare too;  If you want tougher environmental laws you are
</em><br>
supposed to want less 
<br>
<em>&gt; spent on the military also. Why, what's the relationship? It's as if
</em><br>
somebody at random 
<br>
<em>&gt; labeled half of all social problems &quot;liberal&quot; and the other half
</em><br>
&quot;conservative&quot;.
<br>
<p>This is why the libertarian party exists. People like you and me see
<br>
incongruencies and inconsistencies in the platforms of the two major
<br>
parties. Other third parties exist also for this reason, though I don't know
<br>
their platforms well enough to comment on them. 
<br>
<p>I personally defected from the GOP to join the LP because while I am a
<br>
fiscal conservative who favors lower taxes, school vouchers and smaller
<br>
federal government, I also oppose the war on drugs, support the pro-choice
<br>
position on abortion, and in general favor &quot;liberal&quot; social policies. So am
<br>
I a liberal or a conservative? The answer is neither or both. Both camps
<br>
would consider me a heretic. I imagine the same would be true for a large
<br>
number of people here.
<br>
<p>Harvey mentioned in another thread that it's a shame that we sometimes still
<br>
get into left/right polarized debates. I think it happens because we still
<br>
live in a left/right polarized world.
