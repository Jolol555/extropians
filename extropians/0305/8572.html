<em>&gt; This raises the question: how does one get started

</em><br>
<em>&gt; security work?
</em><br>
<p>As with most things, you study the basics then do some
<br>
unpaid work to find out what they don't tell you.  One
<br>
possible exercise: try to break into your own
<br>
computer remotely.  Then see how you might find out,
<br>
using evidence you can gain via the network, how it
<br>
was done if you didn't already know.  Play the roles
<br>
of sysadmin and syscracker, remembering that they
<br>
(usually) won't know each other personally.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, the dark side does document itself in
<br>
this area, at least to a better degree than most
<br>
security areas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confluence of the two (security 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and SW test) seems to me to be a growth industry as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;matter becomes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software&quot;, to whatever degree and at whatever rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it does...
</em><br>
<p>Only if it becomes routine to include vulnerabilities
<br>
in matter.  This is IMO, but: the full potential of
<br>
&quot;cyberwar&quot; is vastly overblown - if people could
<br>
really and easily do the kinds of things they're
<br>
credited with, it'd be about like someone waving a
<br>
wand, melting an exterior wall of a bank vault, and
<br>
helping themselves to the contents without tripping
<br>
any alarms, which means a lot of people would be
<br>
doing exploits that damaging (note: *quantity*, not
<br>
just quality; I'm ignoring exploits that don't even
<br>
net $100K in under an hour's work) and you'd see it on
<br>
the news (can't hide that kind of routine damage for
<br>
long).  Then again, if programmable matter was, for
<br>
sake of &quot;convenience&quot;, routinely open to remote
<br>
commands from just any source (possibly with easily
<br>
forged identification), that might just cause this
<br>
kind of problem...but it'd probably be about as
<br>
popular with consumers as DRM, for similar reason
<br>
(despite what it allows in theory, consumers make
<br>
their decisions on what it is in practice, and if what
<br>
it is in practice is unreliable...).
