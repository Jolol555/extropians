<p>
I don't have time today to try to research the
<br>
original sources on the other stuff, but, as far as
<br>
&quot;Hispanic bashing,&quot; the material on the epidemic of
<br>
STDs among married Hispanic women came from a public
<br>
service medical program a couple or so years back on
<br>
KPFK, the local Pacifica station.  Since this station
<br>
is &quot;progressive, left-wing,&quot; it is highly unlikely
<br>
that they would simply invent the material, as that
<br>
would have flown directly in the face of their
<br>
&quot;multi-culturalism&quot; and their attempt to bring
<br>
Hispanics and any other convenient minority group into
<br>
their &quot;progressive&quot; fold.
<br>
<p>Purely anecdotally, one of the Hispanics who I see on
<br>
a daily basis was really in the dumps of late after he
<br>
got caught cheating on his wife, by his wife, after
<br>
she came down with an STD.  When I drove a cab here in
<br>
Orange County in the '80's, 90% of my customers were
<br>
first-generation, low-income Hispanics, and couldn't
<br>
afford a real woman to prove their manhood, so the
<br>
trans-sexual prostitutes did a land office business at
<br>
the bars.  I carried them as well, and often they were
<br>
indistinguishable from a real woman at first glance.
<br>
<p>I brought this up, not to bash Hispanics, but as
<br>
another example of how irresponsible promiscuous sex
<br>
leads to its natural consequences, so long as there
<br>
are STDs out there.  I could have used various African
<br>
nations or areas, but other people had already
<br>
commented on them.
<br>
<p>I actually don't have anything against sex, either,
<br>
BTW, or motorcycle riding - but I do check the
<br>
mechanical condition of the bike before I ride it.  ;)
