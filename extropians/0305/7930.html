</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I agree with the first part.  Raising HDL while keeping LDL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the same does improve the ratio.  This is good.  But I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the second part is oversimplified.  Raising HDL is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessarily good by itself.  If LDL is not kept even, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increases as well, then the ratio is not improved.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this would be worse (or at least no improvement).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see where you are disagreeing with anything I wrote above, or why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you believe that anything I wrote was &quot;oversimplified.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Your entire paragraph taken as a whole is fine.  I don't think your complete
<br>
viewpoint is oversimplified.
<br>
<p>However, I do think that your last sentence is oversimplified and studies
<br>
that show this are inconclusive.  &quot;Studies show that the risk of heart
<br>
disease is inversely related to plasma HDL.&quot;  I don't believe HDL alone is a
<br>
good predictor of heart disease risk.  I believe both HDL and LDL must be
<br>
measured to determine the ratio which is a better predictor of heart disease
<br>
risk.  As such, studies that measure total cholesterol or HDL alone are
<br>
inconclusive because they are oversimplified.  You seem to understand this,
<br>
but that last sentence taken alone, or those studies which you indirectly
<br>
reference, represent an inaccurate and oversimplified conclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I worry though that many vegetarian diets are too low in fat. The low-fat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diet described in that abstract which showed a negative effect on HDL was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still something like 24% of calories from fat. That seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within range of the typical vegetarian diet.
</em><br>
<p>True, but the &quot;low fat&quot; obsession is orthogonal to vegetarianism.  There are
<br>
low-fat, high-fat, and other diets in both the vegetarian and carnivorous
<br>
realms.  I don't see that either one is necessarily high-fat or low-fat by
<br>
default.  Each would depend on what kinds of foods are chosen, and whether
<br>
the person also practices &quot;low fat&quot; dieting.
<br>
<p>(The vegetarian diet is also orthogonal to animal rights, healthiness,
<br>
liberalism, religiosity and a whole host of other attributes that people
<br>
often stereotype into it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think the only place where we would disagree on fats is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that I believe in a certain ratio of fats which prefers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; essential fatty acids &gt; monounsaturated &gt; polyunsaturated &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; saturated &gt; hydrogenised.  I am not sure if you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; preference between different kinds of fats, or if you prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the reverse order than I do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I certainly don't prefer a reverse order! In fact I strive to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogenised fats altogether.
</em><br>
<p>Then we seem to be mostly agreed on nutrients and what should be in the
<br>
diet.  We choose different dietary methods to achieve our goals, and we
<br>
choose different research methods by which we reach our conclusions, but we
<br>
seem to have converged onto basic agreement about macronutrients in the
<br>
diet.
