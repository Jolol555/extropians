<p>&lt;&lt;&quot;Mind-Machine Merger&quot;
<br>
Technology Review (05/03) Vol. 106, No. 4, P. 38; Huang, Gregory T.
<br>
<p>The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is funding a half-
<br>
dozen brain-machine interface projects for $24 million over two 
<br>
years, and program manager Alan Rudolph says these technologies could 
<br>
both restore and enhance cognitive functions, and 
<br>
have &quot;transformational consequences for defense and society.&quot; A Duke 
<br>
University team led by Miguel Nicolelis is attempting to develop real-
<br>
time, two-way mind-machine communication so that animals and later 
<br>
humans can perform sophisticated operations, while University of 
<br>
Michigan researchers guided by Daryl Kipke are implanting electrodes 
<br>
into rodent and primate brains and teaching the test animals to 
<br>
control six-legged robots via the interface. Such research could one 
<br>
day yield interfaces that allow people to control machines by thought 
<br>
while simultaneously receiving multisensory feedback. Meanwhile, Ted 
<br>
Berger of the University of Southern California is trying to build a 
<br>
computer chip that could be used to bring a damaged hippocampus back 
<br>
to full functionality, as well as augment memory in a healthy brain. 
<br>
Wake Forest University's Sam Deadwyler, a collaborator on Berger's 
<br>
project, believes that such technology could enable people to retain 
<br>
memories longer or remember more and more information. Tomaso Poggio 
<br>
and James DiCarlo of MIT are testing ways to tweak the sending, 
<br>
receiving, and processing of sensory input to enhance a person's 
<br>
communicative and perceptive faculties, perhaps to the point where 
<br>
one brain will be able to wirelessly communicate with another. A key 
<br>
challenge in brain-machine interface research is physically 
<br>
integrating electronics and brain cells in a sustainable way, 
<br>
according to John Chapin of the State University of New York 
<br>
Downstate Medical Center. Wide acceptance of such breakthroughs will 
<br>
depend on whether researchers can find a noninvasive technique to 
<br>
connect brain to machine.
