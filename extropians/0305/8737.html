</em><br>
<p>Most of us here are working on the premise that Jared Diamond was at least
<br>
partially correct in his essay to cite the development of agriculture as a
<br>
primary cause of many modern world problems (e.g., overpopulation in
<br>
under-developed countries, famine, tyranny, standing armies leading to
<br>
massive world wars, etc). Apparently you don't accept that premise. You
<br>
assume in your last sentence that the agricultural revolution has met more
<br>
needs than it created, when Diamond would argue that the revolution created
<br>
more needs than it met.
<br>
<p>If Diamond is right, as I believe he is, then I think extropianism can be
<br>
viewed as a philosophical attempt to prepare an escape from (or a solution
<br>
to) the doomed world 
<br>
we created at the advent of agriculture. Agriculture is not the answer to
<br>
the problem. Agriculture and its ramifications are the problem. 
<br>
<p>Mez points out that agriculture has had some positive benefits too,
<br>
something that no one here denies, but I think those benefits can be (or
<br>
could have been) obtained without agriculture. 
<br>
<p>Most importantly, and most obviously in my view, we need to find a way to
<br>
solve the problem of overpopulation, a problem which became real as a result
<br>
of the agricultural revolution. This is a serious problem we face at least
<br>
until such time as we find a way to colonize other planets. I would rather
<br>
see 6 billion healthy educated prosperous humans on Earth than 50 billion
<br>
impoverished humans scrambling desperately for their share of limited
<br>
resources.
