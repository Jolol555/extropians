Here:
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://verify.stanford.edu/evote.html">http://verify.stanford.edu/evote.html</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>a Stanford professor states the obvious: some electronic voting
<br>
machines are not auditable and easily hacked. But he recommends a
<br>
decidedly low-tech solution: having the machines produce paper
<br>
ballots that are authoritative and that can be audited by hand.
<br>
<p>A much simpler, more automated, and totally auditable solution
<br>
is obvious to me after a few moments of thought, but perhaps I'm
<br>
missing something obvious, so let me put it out there and see if
<br>
you guys can see any flaws (technical or political):
<br>
<p>At the polling place, each voter goes through the touch-screen
<br>
hand-holding menu options of the voting software. When he's done,
<br>
a simple paper receipt is printed that shows an overview of his
<br>
votes, which he is asked to read and confirm by placing it through
<br>
a reader and pressing a comfirmation button. On that receipt is
<br>
also printed a large random number unique to each voter. The
<br>
reader processes the vote and sends it to a central server. If
<br>
the user made a mistake, he just discards the reciept without
<br>
submitting it and starts over. The voter retains this receipt.
<br>
<p>Note that the receipt itself is secure: no one can determine
<br>
from it whose vote it represents, because the only identifier
<br>
on it is a random number.
<br>
<p>After election day, each precinct publishes two lists (on the
<br>
net, on paper, whatever): one is nothing but a list of names of
<br>
everyone who voted. This is already public information (when you
<br>
go in to vote today, your name is checked off on the registration
<br>
list). This way, everyone who voted can verify that his name
<br>
appears on the list, and that names of people who he knows didn't
<br>
vote (or who are dead, etc.) do not appear.
<br>
<p>The second list is the same number of entries, each of which is a
<br>
plaintext list of votes cast, along with a random number index made
<br>
by hashing together the random number printed on the voter stub
<br>
with info such as the voter's name, address, birthdate, etc., and
<br>
the votes themselves (a one-way hash). Each voter can then run a
<br>
program (with a published algorithm) to hash the random number on
<br>
his receipt with the information he knows, and then go to the list,
<br>
find that index, and verify that the published votes match.
<br>
<p>Since the votes themselves are in plaintext, the count is easily
<br>
verified by anyone. There is nothing to match the vote lists to
<br>
people unless you know a voter's personal info and the number on
<br>
his receipt, so ballots are secret. A voter can't repudiate his
<br>
votes because he has to show his paper receipt which isn't
<br>
forgeable because of the one-way hash.
<br>
<p>This way, the permanent record of the vote is totally online, and
<br>
the paper receipts serve as spot-checks. But groups concerned about
<br>
fraud could collect a large number of people to check their votes
<br>
on-camera if desired, and a few people might even make their votes
<br>
public as a further check (only by their choice, of course).
<br>
<p>So, is there an attack here I don't see? If so, can you plug the
<br>
hole, or come up with a system with the same safeguards?
<br>
