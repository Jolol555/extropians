<br>
Conservatives are against the Department of Education, the U.N., and the EPA 
<br>
because of all the liberal changes they are trying to impose.  The &quot;changes&quot; 
<br>
they propose are to get us away from current changers and back to the status 
<br>
quo.
<br>
<p>Are those liberal changes, Harvey?
<br>
Is it liberal to preside over a plunging quality of education in our country 
<br>
while begging for more and more money.  Tell me how would Ben Franklin, Tom 
<br>
Jefferson, John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, etal ever have made it if it wasn't 
<br>
for our well known school system?  Have you ever read George Washington?  
<br>
Like the others he had little formal schooling.  Unlike the others he was not 
<br>
considered especially bright.  If you have ever read his writing you would 
<br>
know he wasn't a slouch intellectually he just couldn't keep up with some of 
<br>
the others.
<br>
Is the UN a liberal idea?  Is this what you want? A group that uses its own 
<br>
prohibitions as a mechanism to deal under the table with the likes of Sadaam 
<br>
Hussein.  Do you want a Koffi Annon in charge of the world administering the 
<br>
oil sales of Iraq and approving Sadaam's buying tons of Viagra while starving 
<br>
the ill and the young?  If so, the UN owes Sadaam Hussein an apology, he 
<br>
apparently thought he had bought protection -- but it was all an allusion.
<br>
And the EPA is a liberal idea?  You want to throttle American industry so 
<br>
that almost all the jobs go to southeast Asia where the greatest cloud of 
<br>
pollution sits over the South Pacific allegedly triggering El Nino.
