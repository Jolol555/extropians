<p>
Here's my take:
<br>
<p>GTS is arguing that of all possible environments, an organism is best
<br>
adapted to the one it evolved in. This does not follow from correct
<br>
reasoning. First of all, an organism is never in the environment in
<br>
which it evolved. The idea borders on meaningless because all organisms
<br>
evolved in many, many differing environments. Second, no matter how well
<br>
adapted an organism is to the current state of its environment, it is
<br>
always conceivable there is some other environment in which the same
<br>
organism would be even more successful. Third, a selection pressure
<br>
occurs only when an organism is *not* adapted to its environment. To be
<br>
fully adapted to the environment is to stop evolving.  No environment is
<br>
static, nor does evolution occur in static environments. 
<br>
<p>GTS is not saying, for example, that an organism may be considered an
<br>
optimal solution to the problems posed by its environment. He is saying
<br>
the contrapositive: that the optimal environment for an organism to live
<br>
in is the one in which it is the solution to the problems posed by the
<br>
environment. The Panglossian error (more of a category mistake) in the
<br>
latter is assuming the category 'optimal environment' is coextensive
<br>
with 'ancestral environment'. Eliezer rightly suggests that GTS'
<br>
argument is broadly applicable to the whole of the ancestral
<br>
environment. If it is best to re-create a paleolithic diet then what's
<br>
stopping us from re-creating a paleolithic lifestyle as well? Surely we
<br>
are better adapted to living in small tribes of hunter-gatherers?
<br>
Fortunately, this conclusion is specious.
