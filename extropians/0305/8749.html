<br>
<em>&gt; The process of &quot;uploading&quot; of a meat brain is at this time mostly

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hormones certainly play a role but are comparatively simple. The deep
<br>
philosophical questions are probably best probed by making partial or
<br>
full uploads.  The genome knowledge is likely pretty irrelevant,
<br>
although it is helpful in figuring out the tricky biochemical pathways
<br>
inside the neurons that play a part in function. The real issue will be
<br>
whether we get a good understanding of 1) low-level neural information
<br>
processing, especially in the synapses, 2) the basic cortical
<br>
microcircuitry (lots of stuff happening here; I expect a breakthrough or
<br>
something within the next 5-20 years) and especially 3) a good scanning
<br>
method.  We don't need to understand the mind, just emulate the brain
<br>
(and bits of the body).
<br>
<p>I think I have a feeling of the uploading problem (famous last words), 
<br>
and it is hardly trivial. But it is a different kind of problem from 
<br>
building an MBrain. The first is deductive to a large extent, we need to 
<br>
understand a system well enough to emulate it robustly. The second is 
<br>
constructive, we need to understand physics and engineering well enough 
<br>
to construct a very complex system. 
<br>
<p>In principle we could start building a bad MBrain today by sending out
<br>
solar collectors and Beowulf clusters into orbit. On the other hand we
<br>
cannot even upload a nematode yet. The MBrain could be extended
<br>
gradually, building on top of simpler models. The uploading requires a
<br>
number of key technologies and understandings; once we have the
<br>
technology to do a reasonable simulation of a nematode from a scan, we
<br>
can just scale it up to a brain. 
<br>
<p>So my answer would be that the upload field will not appear to get
<br>
anywhere from an outside perspective for a long time, and then
<br>
relatively rapidly move to a full upload state. MBrains on the other
<br>
hand will show a slow and steady progress, but take a long time to get
<br>
to Robert's final design.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think Anders begins to consider this issue with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of a &quot;Chronos&quot; neutronium brain -- but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have significant problems with whether I/O from any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such entity is feasible.  (Or whether the bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any external I/O can deal with the amount of internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information being produced.)  [Side note to Anders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and others -- I'm not talking theories here -- I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want real no-magic-physics, yes-I-can-build-this-device
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples.]
</em><br>
<p>In one of my roleplaying scenarios people invented quantum super-AI and
<br>
found it utterly useless, since the little ball of computronium had an
<br>
infinity of superposed AIs attempting to communicate with the outside
<br>
world - the end result was pure noise :-)
<br>
<p>Chronos would have a serious bandwith bottleneck, but an even worse lag 
<br>
both internally and externally. It could blast information across lots 
<br>
of channels, but an information production of 10^53 bits/s is heavy. The 
<br>
Bekenstein bound (eq 29 in my paper) produces a bandwidth bound of 1e35 
<br>
bit/(Js), so it would need 1e18 W just to send the new information. Of 
<br>
course, I assume quasar-like energy dissipation so this is puny (it is 
<br>
just 1e-8 of the sun's luminosity). 
<br>
<p>I think the answer is to have hierarchical intelligence. Parts are fast 
<br>
and act as subsystems for larger, slower and deeper parts. While a 
<br>
subsystem acts as a &quot;reflex arc&quot; of (say) human intelligence, it 
<br>
participates in a larger system with maybe ten times slower reaction 
<br>
speed but a thousand times larger intelligence that sets overall goals, 
<br>
evaluates and distributes current mental tasks etc. This system in turn 
<br>
is part of an even larger and slower cluster, and so on. The top level 
<br>
may be millions of times slower than the local levels, but have an 
<br>
effective intelligence trillions of times the simplest parts.
