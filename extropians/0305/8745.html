In reply to Lee Corbin &quot;&gt; Unfortunately, he followed
<br>
up this tour-de-force with 
<br>
<em>&gt; the creation of the Libertarian Party, which was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largely a disaster for the freedom movement, as I
</em><br>
and 
<br>
<em>&gt; many others predicted at the time. 
</em><br>
<p>You did? Could you say more about why the Libertarian 
<br>
Party was/is such a disaster? I did not realize that 
<br>
this viewpoint existed.

<p>From: Lee Corbin (<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=RE:%20Left/Right...%20can't%20we%20do%20better%20than%20this?">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a>)
<br>
Date: Wed May 21 2003 - 02:07:50 MDT &quot;
<br>
<p>This topic has been extensively discussed here in the
<br>
past, altho not recently, I believe.  A LOT of
<br>
&quot;libertarians&quot; in 1971, including Murray Rothbard
<br>
(founder of the modern anarcho-capitalist movement),
<br>
Robert LeFevre (pacifist libertarian anarchist), Ayn
<br>
Rand (limited constitutional statist who hated the
<br>
term 'libertarian,' but certainly qualified), just to
<br>
name a few, strongly opposed the creation of a
<br>
libertarian party.  Rothbard later switched, once the
<br>
LP had become firmly established.  I, however, can
<br>
recall his being asked, ~&quot;if there were a button that
<br>
could be pushed that would end the state instantly,
<br>
would you push it, without weighing consequences?&quot; 
<br>
Murray: ~&quot;Yes, immediately.&quot;
<br>
<p>There were several threads of critique of the
<br>
impending LP.  From the moral perspective, many
<br>
libertarians foresaw that the LP would inevitably
<br>
partake of the very system it opposed.  Unless an LP
<br>
candidate refused to do any of his &quot;duties,&quot; once
<br>
elected, he would be taking some degree of stolen
<br>
funds.  Worse, from the perspective of some, he would
<br>
be &quot;sanctioning the system&quot; by imputing any legitimacy
<br>
to it.
<br>
<p>From a practical analysis, the LP would suck funds and
<br>
man-years of effort from other promising approaches,
<br>
while diluting the message, perhaps corrupting it
<br>
entirely.  How do you determine WHO is a real
<br>
libertarian?  Isn't that going to subject to vote
<br>
within the LP itself?  How are you going to keep the
<br>
borderline people from slowly dragging the party
<br>
toward the statist end?  How are you going to
<br>
simultaneously go after warm bodies and also present
<br>
the true radical vision of the movement?
<br>
<p>Most of the bad that we foresaw has occurred, altho
<br>
perhaps not exactly in the proportions we dreaded, and
<br>
things that we didn't see as critical turned out to be
<br>
the most important of all.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that in the late '60's thru the mid
<br>
'70's, there were a LOT of non-LP libertarian projects
<br>
happening.  Free market banks and investment services,
<br>
black market nutritional companies, Vonu, libertarian
<br>
schools from pre-school on up, anarchist
<br>
communities...  Find some of the issues of &quot;Reason&quot;
<br>
from that era and look at the classified ads for a
<br>
start.
<br>
<p>The really important thing, however, was the
<br>
intellectual analysis.  There was a tremendous amount
<br>
of intellectual ferment in the movement of that era.
<br>
<p>All that petered out by the early-mid '80's.  The
<br>
deaths of Rand, Lefevre, Galambos, and Rothbard
<br>
certainly left a gaping hole in the ranks.  However,
<br>
most of the innovative, original, important thinking
<br>
had already passed to a younger set of intellectuals
<br>
and activists.
<br>
<p>What they discovered, however, was that the LP, while
<br>
it did do remarkably well at keeping the core vision
<br>
intact, was extremely resistant to new ideas - or ANY
<br>
ideas, for that matter, BECAUSE it is a POLITICAL
<br>
PARTY!!!!  The leadership of a political party gets
<br>
there by known processes, that don't include
<br>
especially having the best political theory.  So, the
<br>
LP ended up with the intellectual 2nd raters, at best,
<br>
who simply avoided any discussion of problems with the
<br>
message or the underlying philosophy.  The thinkers
<br>
simply found themselves without a venue.
<br>
<p>Try engaging an LP candidate on Children's Rights. 
<br>
That issue has been tabled for 25 years or more.  Yet
<br>
it is crucial to getting the mass support that you do
<br>
have a clear, consistent, workable philosophy on that
<br>
issue.  A lot of people have children.  What is the
<br>
actual parental authority and how and when can a 3rd
<br>
party intervene?  Do parents OWN their children?  Or
<br>
do they have rights inherent to being human or
<br>
sentient?  These issues should resonate especially to
<br>
Extropians, as they come up big time regarding the
<br>
issues of uploads, personality duplicates, AI's, etc.
<br>
<p>But, the LP cannot even get it straight on abortion. 
<br>
They have too many members who are &quot;Pro-Life.&quot;  They
<br>
even ran Ron Paul for their Presidential candidate, as
<br>
best I recall.  So they don't take a position... or
<br>
discuss the matter.  So much for solving the problems.
<br>
&nbsp;Just ignore them.
<br>
<p>I have also talked with very active LP members over
<br>
the years who DID have highly successful programs and
<br>
agendas independent of the LP who had to agree to NOT
<br>
DISCUSS what they were doing before an LP audience,
<br>
because it might &quot;detract from the proper focus on
<br>
political action.&quot;  
<br>
<p>I've attended a fair number of LP meetings of various
<br>
sorts over the years.  Sometimes I've participated or
<br>
contributed to various isolated LP protests or other
<br>
projects.  After all, I can talk until I'm blue in the
<br>
face and it won't change most of their minds.  I
<br>
dislike giving them credibility, but I weigh that
<br>
against the value of the project, just as I do when I
<br>
work with leftists on repealing 3-Strikes or drug
<br>
laws.
<br>
<p>Most LP meetings, however, are the most BORING place
<br>
you could imagine.  The DMV lines are a riot in
<br>
comparison.  Some guy or gal gets up and discusses for
<br>
twenty minutes how they got 1.23% of the vote, which
<br>
is an increase of 0.26% over the previous election,
<br>
when they didn't actually have a candidate....  And it
<br>
goes on for hours that way without a shred of
<br>
discussion of revolution.
<br>
<p>What a waste.
