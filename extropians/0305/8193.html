A dictionary represents an approximation of how one group of people used 
<br>
words, or thought words should be used, at one particular time.  They 
<br>
are very useful for looking up words like &quot;tholepin&quot; or &quot;wildebeest&quot;, 
<br>
but much less useful for looking up works like &quot;constructive&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;liberal&quot;.  Live words won't have exactly the same meaning that the 
<br>
dictionary lists...or at best, the chances of this are minor.  The OED 
<br>
handles this by listing references where particular usages can be 
<br>
located (I'd need to invent an example, as my copy is at home).  This 
<br>
isn't perfect, but at least it gives you some handle on when the 
<br>
definition was (became?) current.  A
<br>
&quot;most recent significant&quot; reference as well as an &quot;oldest&quot; reference 
<br>
would improve the utility.
<br>
<p>That said, I tend to consider myself conservative.  I know that most 
<br>
people tend to consider that I am either liberal or radical, or just 
<br>
silly, but that doesn't change my opinion of myself.  And I also tend to 
<br>
consider the radical authoritarian centralists to be an exact opposite 
<br>
of conservative.  We have never before gone in for theocracies or 
<br>
dictatorships, so to do so can't, in my view, be considered conservative 
<br>
by any reasonable stretch.  And I get quite confused by those who 
<br>
consider that liberal and conservative are opposites.  Social concern 
<br>
for the poor has existed longer than the US has existed.  Approaches to 
<br>
handling it have differed, but the concern has been a constant (even if 
<br>
it's only been to grubstake someone to get them out of town).  So in 
<br>
this context &quot;liberal&quot; would just mean favoring more social concern 
<br>
rather than less, and conservative would mean holding onto the forms of 
<br>
concern that are traditional.  (This doesn't work... I think of myself 
<br>
as conservative, but not as a blockhead.  The traditional approaches 
<br>
have depended on having intact communities, and those have been 
<br>
systematically destroyed over the last century and a half...since, in 
<br>
fact, the emergence of large-scale employers like the railroads.  In the 
<br>
1950's people worried about &quot;The Organization Man&quot; as a new 
<br>
phenomenon...he wasn't new, the environment had just become so altered 
<br>
that he was being preferred.  It's become so accepted that people no 
<br>
longer notice, but that was a sign that communities were nearly dead.)
