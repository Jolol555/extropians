<p>Ha! Try Hegel or Kant! Here's an interesting attempt to justify Hegel's
<br>
porridge (from Judith P. Butler, *Subjects of Desire.  Hegelian Reflections
<br>
in Twentieth-Century France*, Columbia University Press, 1987):
<br>
<p>============
<br>
<p>Hegel's sentence structure seems to defy the laws of grammar and to test
<br>
the ontological imagination beyond its usual bounds.  His sentences begin
<br>
with subjects that turn out to be interchangeable with their objects or to
<br>
pivot on verbs that are swiftly negated or inverted in supporting clauses.
<br>
When 'is' is the verb at the core of any claim, it rarely carries a
<br>
familiar burden of predication, but becomes transitive in an unfamiliar and
<br>
foreboding sense, affirming the inherent movement in `being', disrupting
<br>
the ontological assumptions that ordinary language usage lulls us into making.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rhetorical inversion of Hegelian sentences as well as the narrative
<br>
structure of the text as a whole convey the elusive nature of both the
<br>
grammatical and human subject.  Against the Understanding's compulsion to
<br>
fix the grammatical subject into a univocal and static signifier, Hegel's
<br>
sentences indicate that the subject can only be understood in its movement.
<br>
&nbsp;When Hegel states, `Substance is Subject', the `is' carries the burden of
<br>
`becomes', where becoming is not a unilinear but a cyclical process.
<br>
Hence, we read the sentence wrong if we rely on the ontological assumptions
<br>
of linear reading, for the `is' is a nodal point of the interpenetration of
<br>
both `Substance' and `Subject'; each is itself only to the extent that it
<br>
is the other because, for Hegel, self-identity is only rendered actual to
<br>
the extent that it is mediated through that which is different.  To read
<br>
the sentence right would mean to read it cyclically, or to bring to bear
<br>
the variety of partial meanings it permits on any given reading.  [...T]he
<br>
very meaning of the copula itself is being expressed as a locus of movement
<br>
and plurivocality.
<br>
[...]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hegelian sentences are read with difficulty, for their meaning is not
<br>
immediately given or known; they call to be reread, read with different
<br>
intonations and grammatical emphases. Like a line of poetry that stops us
<br>
and forces us to consider that the way in which it is said is essential to
<br>
what it is saying, Hegel's sentences rhetorically call attention to
<br>
themselves.  The discrete and static words on the page deceive us only
<br>
momentarily into thinking that discrete and static meanings will be
<br>
released by our reading.
<br>
[...]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reading for multiple meanings, for plurivocity, ambiguity, and metaphor
<br>
in the general sense, we experience concretely the inherent movement of
<br>
dialectical thinking, the essential alteration of reality.  And we also
<br>
comes to understand the role of our own consciousness in constituting this
<br>
reality inasmuch as the text must be read to have its meaning enacted. [pp.
