<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20(IRAQ)%20RE:%20Name%20calling%20vs.%20Ad%20Hominem">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes: What are you talking about?  The U.S. News 
<br>
media allowed their reporters to be embedded in the army and allowed their 
<br>
reports to be controlled, censored and dictated by the army.  As far as I can 
<br>
tell, the news media was totally controlled by the army's propaganda and 
<br>
disinformation service. 
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't use the rest of your rant as this is sufficient.  I can easily 
<br>
understand your disappointment that the Army did not suffer a tragedy -- 
<br>
after having your personal political viewpoints shown to be faulty must be 
<br>
painful.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporters that wanted to fraternize did so.  Those that did not 
<br>
wish to fraternize did not do so.  At least one story was filed by a reporter 
<br>
complaining about the large number of reporters that hung together, drank 
<br>
together and turned in the Army's handouts.  Even while embedded they would 
<br>
not get out and do their job.  But he admitted that was a minority.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest you quit trying to rewrite history.  Those of us that 
<br>
followed the war remember clearly the negativity of the reporters in the 
<br>
early days of the war.  We were bogged down, we were in another Vietnam, we 
<br>
would be months defeating the Iraqi Army, The Iraqis would blow the bridges 
<br>
and we would be forever even driving the distance to Baghdad.  Oh, and our 
<br>
supply lines were deficient leaving our soldiers in hunger, thirst &amp; out of 
<br>
ammo while our vehicles lacked both ammo &amp; fuel.
<br>
