<em>&gt; No, Emlyn this is way overly pessimistic.  We are here to 
</em><br>

<p>In my more pessimistic moments I always feel that this universe is worth
<br>
being angry about. Look at the fate of those who went before us;
<br>
ignominious, really. Implicitly, we assume that we wont share that fate, but
<br>
that's not at all certain.
<br>
<p>The very fact that we have scarcity is crazy. Why isn't our environment
<br>
directly manipulable; eg: why is there matter? Humans are having to go to
<br>
absolutely extreme lengths to make matter behave like software (not there
<br>
yet), when it could have been that way from the beginning.
<br>
<p>Existence just seems so bloody banal. It's a bad hollywood script that
<br>
originating from what was once someone's good idea; you can still sense the
<br>
spark of brilliance in there somewhere, but the implementation of reality
<br>
seems hopelessly unimaginative and shitty. It's been thought up by the kinds
<br>
of people that think we'll have traffic jams of flying cars in extreme urban
<br>
future cities. Stupid.
<br>
<p>Not to say that these aren't interesting times, and that we can't add a few
<br>
layers of implementation to create a much more satisfactory virtual universe
<br>
running in the real one. But standing back, it really does look like we are
<br>
making the best of an appalling job.
