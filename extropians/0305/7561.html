<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, that's exactly what Eli is saying you mean, and is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classic logic error. [Explanation removed]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer doesn't read my messages carefully, else he would have known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all along that I do not reject improvements on the paleodiet...
</em><br>
<p>Absolute hogwash. It's very clear to me that he reads and
<br>
understands the issue completely, and that when he corrects
<br>
your mistaken arguments, you are misinterpreting that as his
<br>
misunderstanding rather than yours. It's also interesting to
<br>
me that you chose to elide my explanation of your error in
<br>
this reply--it very clearly states what we're trying to say--
<br>
and we are /not/ by any stretch of the English language saying
<br>
that you reject improvements on the paleo diet, and your
<br>
claim that we are saying that is more hogwash. W're just
<br>
pointing out to you that some of your arguments for it are
<br>
incorrect, and you refuse to acknowledge that simple fact.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My advocacy of natural paleolithic diets should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construed to mean that I am advocating a Luddite point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view, or that I am anti-science. All arguments along such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines are BS.
</em><br>
<p>Neither Eli nor I have made such arguments--nor would we,
<br>
because we actually care that our arguments are valid.
<br>
Hal only said that he got that impression, but that's not
<br>
an argument, just a personal opinion.
<br>
<p>I do not take issue with even fanatical support of a point
<br>
of view--I clearly do that myself (but mostly with ethical
<br>
issues). But if you continue to support the point of view
<br>
with weak arguments, and refuse to strengthen them when the
<br>
weaknesses are pointed out to you, you will continue to lose
<br>
credibility in the eyes of those who care about rational
<br>
debate (which, admittedly, may be a minority).
