<p>This seems to me like you want democracy when it suits you 
<br>
but not when it doesn't. Thats not an unreasonable thing to *want*,
<br>
indeed its probably human nature, and what many of us want much 
<br>
of the time, but its not a likely thing to happen. 
<br>
<p>Your signature quote &quot;Live free or die, death is not the worst of 
<br>
evils&quot; is probably a maxim that would find a lot of sympathy amongst
<br>
those who attacked America on September 11. Can the human 
<br>
sentiment behind that cycle be broken by force in your view or is
<br>
it something fundamental and resilient? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Seems to me that if one plans to permanently cut out huge sections
<br>
of the human population from &quot;the good life&quot; AND lets then see that
<br>
one is doing it, one had better be prepared for permanent war. 
<br>
<p>If there is no choice then perhaps the best one can do is face the
<br>
facts and resolve to be a good fighter until one grows weary or 
<br>
old or needs to sleep. But there is little peace in that. 
<br>
<p>Seems it could be in the interests of the strong, whilst they are
<br>
strong, to plan for peace or acknowledge that they are planning
<br>
by default for their death.
