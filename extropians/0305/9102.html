<p>I would expect the two Bayesians to immediately accept that each of their
<br>
viewpoints are equally valid within each one's estimate of the range of
<br>
uncertainty, but it seems to me that for them to immediately and absolutely
<br>
agree on the issue would require certainty that they perfectly understand
<br>
each other's comprehension of the issue.  For non-trivial issues I think
<br>
this perfect understanding is almost never the case.
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm missing something.  I'll try to find time to read your paper more
<br>
thoroughly.
