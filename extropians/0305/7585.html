<em>&gt; interesting points. If it indeed is incorrect information you should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to easily shoot it down
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough!
<br>
<p>Here is my take on the paper.  There is a shorter summary at the end.  This
<br>
paper seems weak on science and logic, but does not present any totally
<br>
wacky theories.  It seems to miss the mark in various areas and doesn't
<br>
provide strong proof either way.  It is more of a opinion piece rather than
<br>
evidence, despite the attempted use of numerous footnotes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I brought up the page for discussion after you specifically asked to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know if there was anyone out there advising that eating saturated fats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is useful. I intend to do my part to keep at least this small part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list on topic.
</em><br>
<p>This paper totally fails to address this question about saturated fats.  It
<br>
lumps all fats together, and merely argues that (some) &quot;fats&quot; are required.
<br>
It rambles around the mulberry bush and never directly addresses the value
<br>
of saturated versus unsaturated fats.  It seems to be a rambling collection
<br>
of unrelated studies, most of which fail to prove anything, but few of which
<br>
actually support any point the author is making.
<br>
<p>The introduction lumps all &quot;fats&quot; together.  It doesn't distinguish between
<br>
saturated and unsaturated fats.  It argues all the reasons why &quot;fats&quot; are
<br>
needed in the diet.  Basically, the argument that &quot;fat&quot; is needed is
<br>
consistent with the theory that saturated fats are bad and unsaturated fats
<br>
are good.  This introduction makes the logical flaw of lumping dissimilar
<br>
categories together and then applying any evaluation of one item to all the
<br>
others.  Just because some &quot;fats&quot; are good doesn't mean all &quot;fats&quot; are good.
<br>
The basic outline of the paper in the introduction is confused and flawed
<br>
and illogical.  It doesn't distinguish its position from the position it
<br>
attacks.  The way it has worded its claims applies to both sides.  It seems
<br>
to have evolved from an older paper where there was no distinction between
<br>
good fat or bad fat, good cholesterol or bad cholesterol.  Thus, the
<br>
arguments for or against &quot;fats&quot; doesn't address whether saturated fats and
<br>
unsaturated fats are equally required.
<br>
<p>The discussion of Pritikin doesn't really give any facts or evidence against
<br>
it.  Pritikin was originally just low fat, and then later added vegetable
<br>
oils, so it contained unsaturated fats but not saturated fats.  There is no
<br>
explanation why this diet was bad.  The paper implies that the addition of
<br>
vegetable oils proved the low fat diet wrong, but instead it merely
<br>
clarified that saturated fats are bad and unsaturated fats are good.  No
<br>
evidence against the modified diet was presented either.  In fact, the main
<br>
point seems to be that Dr. Pritikin may of saved himself from heart disease,
<br>
but died of cancer instead.  It presented the history in a negative tone,
<br>
but didn't really give any evidence or facts about what was wrong with it.
<br>
<p>The section on &quot;evidence&quot; gives a history of the rise of heart disease, but
<br>
doesn't really given any evidence of what causes it.  It claims that butter
<br>
consumption reduced during this time, but doesn't really address the
<br>
question whether fat consumption when up or down.  It assumes total fat
<br>
consumption went down in the American diet proportional with butter
<br>
consumption, and that the modern American diet is less fatty than 60 years
<br>
previous.  This is both unproven and unlikely.  This is not very strong
<br>
evidence for the decline of fat in the diet, nor is there any evidence of a
<br>
cause and effect in any case.  Furthermore, most of the studies being
<br>
&quot;refuted&quot; in this article are from the 1950's.
<br>
<p>The representation of the Framingham Heart Study does not match what I find
<br>
on the Framingham Heart Study webpage
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/</a>&gt;.  The study did not divide
<br>
people into high-fat and low-fat groups, it had a single large group of
<br>
people.  It did not focus primarily on diet or fat, but measured all
<br>
different factors in a person's life.  High fat versus low fat is not
<br>
mentioned in the list of study findings at
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/timeline.htm">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/timeline.htm</a>&gt;.  Cigarette
<br>
smoking, serum cholesterol, physical activity, blood pressure, menopause,
<br>
psychosocial factors, enlarged ventricles, and other factors are reported,
<br>
but I don't see anything about diet.  This was not primarily a diet study,
<br>
nor did it compare high-fat with low-fat groups.  I don't see how this
<br>
relates to the &quot;lipid hypothesis&quot;, how it was supposedly refuted in this
<br>
article, and what difference it would make if it were.
<br>
<p>I can't really evaluate most of the studies cited, because it doesn't give
<br>
any details about them or their methodology.  However, all the studies are
<br>
ones that were supposed to prove the low-fat hypothesis and failed to do so.
<br>
There were no studies that actually showed that saturated fats were
<br>
required.  This seems scant evidence that all studies showing unsaturated
<br>
fat to be superior to saturated fats were all flawed.  It also provides
<br>
absolutely no evidence that saturated fats are required in the diet.
<br>
<p>The dates of these studies also bothers me.  They were 1983, 1983, 1982,
<br>
1983, 1984, 1985.  We no a lot more about fats today than we did 20 years
<br>
ago.  These studies may have been flawed since they reduced all fats and
<br>
didn't distinguish between different types.  But a lack of proof from
<br>
studies 20 years ago does not refute modern studies performed today.  I
<br>
think modern studies clearly do show some fats to be better or at least
<br>
different than other fats.  A lack of proof of this fact from 20 years ago
<br>
is not conclusive or convincing.
<br>
<p>The studies that refute the lipid hypothesis were similarly old and flawed.
<br>
They measured &quot;cholesterol&quot; without distinguishing between good (HDL)
<br>
cholesterol and bad (LDL) cholesterol.  Cholesterol is not a direct
<br>
predictor of heart attack anyway.  Even if these studies are flawed, this
<br>
doesn't address the question of saturated fats in the diet.  All of these
<br>
studies discussed by this article seem to be a little off base.  None of
<br>
them directly study saturated fat versus unsaturated fat.  These studies
<br>
also &quot;failed&quot; to prove cholesterol caused heart attacks, or that dietary
<br>
cholesterol causes serum cholesterol.  But these don't directly address the
<br>
question of whether dietary saturated fats are required or not.
<br>
<p>Although none of the studies seemed to distinguish between different types
<br>
of fats, the paper goes on to discuss saturated, monounsaturated, and
<br>
polyunsaturated fats.  None of the previously-mentioned studies support or
<br>
discount this discussion, as they all seem to be on orthogonal topics.  The
<br>
discussion of the chemical classification of fats seems accurate, but
<br>
sloppily worded in places.
<br>
<p>The problems with too much polyunsaturated oils seem like they would apply
<br>
to any oil.  Excessive consumption of these fats causes obesity-related
<br>
symptoms such as cancer, heart disease, immune system depression, liver
<br>
damage, etc.  It also discusses how oils can become oxidized and oxidized
<br>
oils are bad for you.  However, it does not show that other oils don't have
<br>
the exact same problems.  The paper then discusses the imbalance of too much
<br>
omega-6 and too little omega-3, but fails to show how saturated fats would
<br>
help this balance.
<br>
<p>The section that actually gets into the benefits of saturated fats is very
<br>
short compared to the other rambling rants that don't get to the point.
<br>
This section seems to only describe the benefits of saturated fatty acids in
<br>
the body.  Most of these uses inside the body provide no clue as to whether
<br>
saturated fat needs to be incorporated in the diet, or if the body is
<br>
incapable of manufacturing its own saturated fat.  The second point does
<br>
assert that 50% of dietary fat should be saturated, but it is unclear why.
<br>
They study cited is about the effects of vitamin E on bone health, and not
<br>
details about why this dietary need is given.  Besides this minor
<br>
references, all of the points are about the need for saturated fat in the
<br>
tissues, which is not disputed.  Even vegetarian animals such as cows
<br>
produce a lot of saturated fat.  This paper certainly provides no evidence
<br>
that humans have lost the ability to produce their own saturated fat like
<br>
other animals such that it needs to be incorporated into the diet.
<br>
<p>The section on cholesterol is similar.  It shows all the vital roles
<br>
cholesterol plays internally.  it does not show that cholesterol is a
<br>
required nutrient which cannot be created by our bodies.
<br>
<p>In summary:
<br>
1. This paper refutes a &quot;low-fat&quot; diet without distinguishing between good
<br>
and bad fats.
<br>
2. This paper uses mostly very old references and few modern sources.
<br>
3. This paper shows a few studies that failed to prove high fat was bad, and
<br>
acted like this was evidence for the reverse.
<br>
4. This paper showed no studies that high fat was good.
<br>
5. This paper showed saturated fats were required internally, and then just
<br>
assumed that they must be required in the diet if they are found in the
<br>
body.
<br>
7. This paper showed bad effects of too much or oxidized unsaturated fats,
<br>
but failed to show that saturated fats did not suffer from these same
<br>
negative effects.
<br>
8. The paper showed no evidence of good effects from eating saturated fats,
<br>
and no comparison studies that measured saturated fat in the diet at all.
<br>
9. The section on benefits of saturated fat only addressed fatty acids.
<br>
10. The paper frequently got off on unrelated tangents, like proving dietary
<br>
cholesterol might not cause cholesterol, or meat contains more B-vitamins
<br>
than vegetables, all of which are orthogonal to the discussion of saturated
<br>
fats.
<br>
11. The paper cited a decline in butter use and assumed that this indicated
<br>
a decline in total fat intake.
<br>
12. The paper had a lot of logical fallacies.  It combined dissimilar
<br>
categories of items and used evidence about one to apply to another.  It had
<br>
sections labeled with one topic which then proceeded to discuss a different
<br>
point.  It took a lack of evidence of one theory to indicate support for
<br>
another.  It made unsupported assertions laced with references supporting
<br>
minor unrelated points.
<br>
<p>There was little to refute in this paper.  Most of its logic was flawed and
<br>
its evidence orthogonal to what it was presenting.  It mostly boiled down to
<br>
the argument that its theory hasn't been proven wrong and therefore must be
<br>
right.  I saw only a few minor implied statements that eating saturated fat
<br>
would be good.
<br>
<p>At best, this paper might be a hold-over from an earlier period when all
<br>
fats were lumped together and all cholesterol was thought to be bad.  This
<br>
paper does a poor job of asserting the correct position that not all fats
<br>
are bad and not all cholesterol is bad.  It does not address diet as much as
<br>
internal chemistry.  It also appears to me that the chemistry section
<br>
discussing different types of fats was tacked on to an earlier paper that
<br>
didn't make this distinction.  Although all the right definitions were
<br>
included in one section, these distinctions were ignored in the discussion,
<br>
evidence and persuasive sections.  By mixing good fats with bad fats, and
<br>
good cholesterol with bad cholesterol, this paper neither supports nor
<br>
refutes the question of whether &quot;fats&quot; are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.
