<p><em>&gt; Me [John]:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; conservatives are supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; be in favor of Low taxes and preventing women from having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; abortions but what does one have to do with the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Lee writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's the interesting question; there are answers, but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may find them boring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Translation: I don't have a clue.
</em><br>
<p>No, I did point you (I think) to Thomas Sowell's &quot;Conflict of
<br>
Visions&quot;.  Have you read it?  In it he expounds at length
<br>
on the difference between the Constrained and the Unconstraint
<br>
visions.  But I'm not going to try to recapitulate his entire
<br>
thesis at this time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The usual translation of the point is, &quot;I am above such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mediocre limitations&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am humiliated! I thought I was writing clearly enough that a translation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not needed but apparently not. So that I may correct any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misunderstanding on the matter let me humbly say as directly as I know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I AM ABOVE SUCH MEDIOCRE LIMITATIONS. Thank you for your time.
</em><br>
<p>You are very welcome, as always.  But alas, quite opposite
<br>
to what you have just written, you are now claiming (in &quot;I
<br>
don't have a clue&quot;) that you were sincere, and that I was
<br>
wrong to suppose that your only point was that these silly
<br>
people are illogical (and that you were above that).  I do
<br>
apologize for having misread you.
<br>
<p>The whole &quot;Constrained Vision&quot; thing explains why many people
<br>
would embrace political policies that lead to less government
<br>
and also embrace traditional religious outlooks.
<br>
<p>Lee
