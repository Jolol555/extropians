<p><p><p>Will we ever make machines that are as smart as ourselves?
<br>
<p>&quot;AI has been brain-dead since the 1970s,&quot; said AI guru <A HREF="http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky">Marvin Minsky</A> in a 
<br>
recent speech at Boston University. Minsky co-founded the &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/">http://www.ai.mit.edu/</a>&quot;&gt;MIT Artificial 
<br>
Intelligence Laboratory&lt;/A&gt; in 1959 with John McCarthy.
<br>
<p>Such notions as &quot;water is wet&quot; and &quot;fire is hot&quot; have proved elusive quarry 
<br>
for AI researchers. Minsky accused researchers of giving up on the immense 
<br>
challenge of building a fully autonomous, thinking machine.
<br>
<p>&quot;The last 15 years have been a very exciting time for AI,&quot; said &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erussell">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erussell</a>&quot;&gt;Stuart 
<br>
Russell&lt;/A&gt;, director of the <A HREF="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/CIS">Center for Intelligent Systems</A> at the University of 
<br>
California at Berkeley, and co-author of an AI textbook, Artificial 
<br>
Intelligence: A Modern Approach.
<br>
<p>Russell, who described Minsky's comments as &quot;surprising and disappointing,&quot; 
<br>
said researchers who study learning, vision, robotics and reasoning have made 
<br>
tremendous progress.
<br>
<p>AI systems today <A HREF="http://www.aicorp.co.uk/index.asp">detect</A> credit-card fraud by learning from earlier 
<br>
transactions. And computer engineers continue to refine <A HREF="http://www.research.ibm.com/hlt">speech recognition</A> 
<br>
systems for PCs and <A HREF="http://www.identix.com/products/pro_security_bnp_argus.html">face recognition</A> systems for security applications.
<br>
<p>&quot;We're building systems that detect very subtle patterns in huge amounts of 
<br>
data,&quot; said Tom Mitchell, director of the &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.cald.cs.cmu.edu/">http://www.cald.cs.cmu.edu/</a>&quot;&gt;Center for Automated Learning and 
<br>
Discovery&lt;/A&gt; at Carnegie Mellon University, and president of the &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.aaai.org/">http://www.aaai.org/</a>&quot;&gt;American 
<br>
Association for Artificial Intelligence&lt;/A&gt;. &quot;The question is, what is the best 
<br>
research strategy to get (us) from where we are today to an integrated, 
<br>
autonomous intelligent agent?&quot;
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, the strategies most popular among AI researchers in the 1980s 
<br>
have come to a dead end, Minsky said. So-called &quot;expert systems,&quot; which 
<br>
emulated human expertise within tightly defined subject areas like <A HREF="http://cs.anu.edu.au/software/shyster">law</A> and &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.openclinical.org/aisp_apache.html">http://www.openclinical.org/aisp_apache.html</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>
medicine&lt;/A&gt;, could match users' queries to relevant diagnoses, papers and 
<br>
abstracts, yet they could not learn concepts that most children know by the 
<br>
time they are 3 years old.
<br>
<p>&quot;For each different kind of problem,&quot; said Minsky, &quot;the construction of 
<br>
expert systems had to start all over again, because they didn't accumulate 
<br>
common-sense knowledge.&quot;
<br>
<p>Only one researcher has committed himself to the colossal task of building a 
<br>
comprehensive common-sense reasoning system, according to Minsky. Douglas 
<br>
Lenat, through his <A HREF="http://www.cyc.com/index.html">Cyc project</A>, has directed the line-by-line entry of more 
<br>
than 1 million rules into a commonsense knowledge base.&gt;&gt;
