<p><em>&gt; &gt; Just out of curiosity, do you consider Hot and Cold to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reified Things?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, in the sense that they are useful simplifications of reality. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Left, like Hot, is not a real thing, but unlike Hot, it isn't useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either.
</em><br>
<p>The reason that it seems useful to me (or, at any rate has up
<br>
until now) is that by saying &quot;He leans towards the Left&quot;, one
<br>
has said
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;he probably favors strict gun control
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he is probably supports a minimum wage
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he probably is for socialized medicine
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he was probably against the Iraq incursion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he is probably not a free market enthusiast
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he is probably tolerant of sexual deviancy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he's probably in favor of increased socialism
<br>
<p>and so on(!).  While perhaps few particular leftists subscribe
<br>
to everything I've just written, if a &quot;Leftist&quot; does not subscribe
<br>
to at least five of the seven, he's a pretty poor excuse for a
<br>
Leftist  ;-)  and I think that my list could be extended to 20
<br>
items without too much work.
<br>
<p>So this seems to me to be a brief way to summarize all this knowledge,
<br>
namely, by referring to a position on &quot;the&quot; political spectrum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my (lack of) experience, I've found that the particular labels Left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Right are used solely as weapons in a fight, not tools in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so you say.  How strange.  Normally, among the people I talk to,
<br>
even the television programs I see, it's mostly mentioned the way that
<br>
hair color or race might be, as a kind of fact of life.  IMO, someone
<br>
has to have led a kind of sheltered existence to consider the statement
<br>
&quot;X is a leftist&quot; to be an insult, or &quot;X is conservative&quot; likewise.
<br>
<p>Importantly, &quot;X is a right-winger&quot; is an insult, because few of those
<br>
who are self-admittedly on the Right ever use this term to describe
<br>
themselves.  Perhaps this is true of &quot;left-wing&quot; too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lumping somebody in with, say, The Right, implies they support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a whole lot more baggage than may be the case, usually in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempted construction of a straw man.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  As I say, our experiences differ.
<br>
<p>Now let's examine a case in which we would agree that a bad sort of
<br>
reification has occurred.  The one that comes to mind is &quot;Evil&quot;.
<br>
What does it mean to say &quot;he is evil&quot;?
<br>
<p>Unlike the case for the list I made above, I don't really think that
<br>
anything is connoted by &quot;he is evil&quot;, unless some very religious
<br>
people who embrace certain doctrines are talking, for among them,
<br>
this may be a perfectly reasonable statement, and be shorthand for
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;he has allowed Satan into his heart
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he has ceased following the way of the Lord
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;his behavior is anti-social and corrupt
<br>
<p>etc.  In their case, then, I would say that they know what they
<br>
are talking about (at least to each other).  Now, what is the
<br>
harm?  Well, from our point of view, this reification has only
<br>
one problem, doesn't it?  Namely that we don't think that many
<br>
of the references in those sentences have referents in reality.
<br>
