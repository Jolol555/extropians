<p>
I see both the averagist and totalist positions as being too extreme to
<br>
be effective strategies for altruism.  The averagist falls into the trap
<br>
that eliminating unhappy people makes the average happiness level rise.
<br>
And the totalist falls into the corresponding error, of increasing the
<br>
population beyond the carrying capacity until everyone is just one step
<br>
from committing suicide.
<br>
<p>All else being equal, everyone would agree that more and happier people
<br>
are good.  The problem is in how you judge the tradeoffs.  At some
<br>
point, adding more people is not good if it makes them less happy.
<br>
And making them happier is not good if it reduces the numbers who can
<br>
enjoy the happiness.  We need a balance.
<br>
<p>Then there is the problem of inter-personal comparisons of happiness.
<br>
It is very questionable whether this can be done properly.  Some people
<br>
may be internal &quot;dramatists&quot; who see relatively small changes in their
<br>
circumstances as causing great swings in their happiness.  Others are on
<br>
a more even keel.  Some would say that they are generally happy, others
<br>
that they are generally unhappy.  I don't see how we can say that person
<br>
A's happiness ranges from -500 to 1000 while person B's happiness ranges
<br>
from -50 to 20, and somehow combine these values numerically to decide
<br>
that A's welfare is more important than B's.
<br>
<p>Economists manage to avoid this problem.  Essentially, they assume that
<br>
happiness is not inter-comparable.  If you do this, your job becomes
<br>
easier.  All you can have as your goal is Pareto-optimality.
<br>
<p>A Pareto-optimal state is one where you can't make anyone happier
<br>
without making someone else less happy.  Generally in economics this is
<br>
judged solely in terms of distribution of goods, but I think it could
<br>
be generalized to compare world-states, making it a tool for altruists.
<br>
<p>Now, it might seem at first that rearranging goods to make one person
<br>
happy will inevitably require making someone else unhappy.  However that
<br>
is not the case; it is often possible for A and B to exchange goods such
<br>
that both sides end up happier.  These are what we know as voluntary
<br>
trades.  A Pareto-optimal state is one where all voluntary trades have
<br>
been allowed to occur.  Once you have reached this state, no one can be
<br>
made happier without hurting someone else.
<br>
<p>From the altruist's perspective, this is not a bad solution.  If everyone
<br>
is happier in state X than in state Y (or at least, no less happy),
<br>
then X is a better goal state than Y for the altruist.  Totalists,
<br>
averagists, and altruists of all stripes would agree on this, I think.
<br>
The Pareto-optimal states are just those where there are no states that
<br>
&quot;dominate&quot; in terms of happiness, no states where everyone is happier,
<br>
or at least as happy.
<br>
<p>The problem is that Pareto-optimality is too weak a condition.  There are
<br>
too many states that are Pareto-optimal but which don't satisfy our
<br>
instincts about altruism.  For example, a state where one guy has
<br>
everything and everyone else has nothing could be Pareto-optimal.
<br>
There's no way to improve anyone's state without taking something from
<br>
the guy who has all the goods.  But this won't sound like a very good
<br>
world to most altruists.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, Pareto-optimality seems to be the best you can do if you
<br>
reject inter-personal comparison of happiness.  To go beyond it, you
<br>
have to start taking from Peter to pay Paul, and ultimately that means
<br>
you have to decide that Peter's happiness is less important than Paul's
<br>
(where there may be multiple Pauls and just one Peter, for example).
<br>
You have to be able to come up with a number that tells just how much
<br>
each person's happiness is affected by changes in the world, and some
<br>
way of comparing these numbers between people.
<br>
<p>It looks to me like a very tricky philosophical problem, making these
<br>
kinds of judgements.  People differ enormously in their attitudes
<br>
towards pleasure and reward; some of their responses are biological,
<br>
and some due to training.  An altruist better be prepared to address
<br>
these thorny philosophical issues, if he is going to compare happiness
<br>
levels between individuals.
