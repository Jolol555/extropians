<a href="mailto:gts_2000@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20More%20enthusiasm%20than%20news%20in%20Fox's%20coverage%20of%20war">gts_2000@yahoo.com</a> writes: Getting back to the subject, I just think it's a bit silly to 
<br>
suggest that late night comedians like Jay Leno have some kind of liberal 
<br>
political agenda
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moi? Silly?  I don't believe I called Leno a left winger.  Most of the 
<br>
time if they get onto ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS they are left wing but not 
<br>
necessarily -- after all a hundred years ago (maybe a little less) they used to 
<br>
have specials with Bob Hope.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't even object to Leno's getting paid for doing what the customer 
<br>
wants to hear.  I confined myself to the criticizing the many jokes I hear on 
<br>
TV that are labeled as being about individuals who are attached to the joke 
<br>
only by the label.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly I don't care if the butt of the joke is Clinton, Bush or 
<br>
anyone else you care to name.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be happy to sit with you and watch Leno -- if you let me have 
<br>
the remote control.  In about 30 seconds I will be out of there.  &lt;G&gt;  After 
<br>
all as you say 25% of the potential audience is a big audience.  But then, 75% 
<br>
is a lot more.
