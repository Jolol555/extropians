<p>
I'm currently exploring a number of personal and business networking tools
<br>
online, and finding they have great utility for me. This is something of a
<br>
bit-flipped inversion from my normal persona as the archfiend of insular
<br>
antisocial intent, but I'm having fun and getting things accomplished, so it
<br>
can't all be bad. However: more transhumanists needed. I know a bunch of you
<br>
guys Do Transhumanist Things, in business and otherwise. Hell, I'm so far
<br>
behind the curve when it comes to social and networking issues half of you
<br>
are probably use these tools already.
<br>
<p>So get thee hence and check these business networks out:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.ryze.com">http://www.ryze.com</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.linkedin.com">http://www.linkedin.com</a>
<br>
<p>The utility in these is really just a central place to meet new people in
<br>
your business sphere and on the peripherals; like a non-stop friendly visit
<br>
with the VCs and other industry members. Ryze seems more useful than
<br>
LinkedIn so far (more of that craigslist type atmosphere, the personal
<br>
touch, diversity: the &quot;Networks&quot; on Ryze are very useful), but I'm still
<br>
toying with both.
<br>
<p>And for social set: www.friendster.com. The utility of this one is not in
<br>
meeting people; it's in following up on meetings, figuring out who the nodes
<br>
in your social sphere are. YMMV, but pretty much my entire chosen subculture
<br>
worldwide is on this thing, so I find it very useful.
<br>
<p>Anyone who feels they've exchanged enough e-mails or butted heads with me
<br>
often enough to link to me, let me know offlist. I may even get around to
<br>
meeting some of you people in person one of these years :)
<br>
<p>I'm looking for other suggestions for social networking tools that people
<br>
are trying and getting results from too. Or comments of the efficacy of the
<br>
whole shebang, thoughts about business models, where this is all going to,
<br>
why these tools work sooooo much better than any other similar models tried
<br>
in the last ten years. It's definately interesting.
