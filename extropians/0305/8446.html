<em>&gt; I did some more checking on this subject of &quot;fraud.&quot; I'm sure Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that Wayne LaPierre of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the NRA has no basis for accusing CNN of misrepresenting the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against so-called assault weapons unless he can show that the CNN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporter John Zarrella used more powerful ammunition in the banned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semi-automatic assault weapons than he did in the non-automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons during his comparison of the two classes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons in the original controversial broadcast. 
</em><br>
<p>You are wrong. Zarella used different TARGETS in his demonstration,
<br>
made of different materials, which respond differently to the same
<br>
ballistic energy.
<br>
<p>Rifles on the banned list do not cause any more damage than rifles not
<br>
on the list when firing the exact same ammunition at the same targets.
<br>
It is a violation of the laws of physics to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems the only semi-reasonable arguments that gun control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocates can make against so-called assault weapons is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successive rounds from these banned guns can be fired more quickly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and with less frequent re-loading. The banned weapons do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily use more lethal ammunition than legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons, but on the other hand the larger magazines and rapid fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capabilities of the banned semi-automatics certainly do make them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better suited for criminal purposes than non-automatic weapons.
</em><br>
<p>THis is the crux of the fraud. There are plenty of rifles which can
<br>
carry just as much ammo firing the exact same type of ammo which are
<br>
not on the banned list, and which are semiautomatic just as those on
<br>
the list.
<br>
<p>THERE ARE NO AUTOMATIC RIFLES ON THE BANNED LIST!!!! This was also part
<br>
of the fraud. Zarella implied that the banned rifles were automatic,
<br>
i.e. machine guns. There was not a single machine gun on the list, and
<br>
in fact, you can still buy machine guns legally in most states in the
<br>
US.
<br>
<p>The only things which qualify a rifle for being on the federal banned
<br>
list is if it has ALL of the following: a detachable magazine, a pistol
<br>
grip, and a bayonet lug. Remove the bayonet lug and it is no longer an
<br>
'assault weapon'. 
<br>
<p>Being 'banned' is purely a matter of cosmetics. If a rifle 'looks'
<br>
military, they want it on the banned list, if it isn't already,
<br>
irrespective of whether it is actually more dangerous or not.
<br>
<p>Whether a rifle 'looks military' has absolutely no bearing on its
<br>
utility for hunting (and I'll bet Bernie Parks has never hunted a day
<br>
in his life). Moreover, whether a rifle has ONLY a 'sporting purpose'
<br>
has never been a test of a rifles legality. The only place where that
<br>
was a test was in Nazi Germany under the Reichsgeletsblatt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It appears the ten year ban on these so-called assault weapons will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expire in '94. The White House has stated that Bush favors an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension of the ban, but at this point it appears that neither 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush nor Congress are actually going to push for an extension. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This makes the NRA very upset given that the GOP controls the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; White House and Congress and given that the NRA thinks it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controls the GOP. :) It's no wonder that Wayne LaPierre of the NRA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was so beside himself in the interview with Kyra Phillips of CNN. 
</em><br>
<p>I think you are backwards here. The ban ends in 04, not 94, and the NRA
<br>
is not at all upset that the ban is ending, it is the liberals who are
<br>
trying to renew it. Senator Feinstein has a bill to renew it, and CNN
<br>
is making these misrepresentations in order to scare the public into
<br>
clamoring their congresspersons to support Feinsteins bill, which does
<br>
more than renew the ban, she expands it to four times as many models of
<br>
rifles, as well as lay the groundwork for a ban of ALL high powered
<br>
rifles, even bolt action rifles, if they are capable of being used as
<br>
sniper rifles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wayne LaPierre also charges that Zarrella of CNN &quot;implied&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banned semi-automatic weapons are the same as fully automatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine guns (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been banned since 1934, and are not a matter of dispute) but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's difficult to charge fraud based on a mere implication.
</em><br>
<p>Machine guns have NOT been banned since 1934. I own one, and so do tens
<br>
of thousands of other law abiding americans, including a number of
<br>
other members of this list. The 1934 law is a tax law that imposes a
<br>
$200 federal tax on their purchase. Your state may have a local ban on
<br>
machine guns, but there is no federal ban.
