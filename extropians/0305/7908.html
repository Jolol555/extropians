<em>&gt;&gt;  <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/">http://www.iraqbodycount.net/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   (~2500 Iraqi civilians died)
</em><br>
Lee Daniel Crocker:
<br>
<em>&gt;That figure is not anywhere close to reality (not that you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expect a site named &quot;bodycount&quot; to care about the truth anyway).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The data is still being collected, but it looks like even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military casualties of the war may be as low as 5,000, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilians in the hundreds.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but I'm extremely skeptical. That number would barely
<br>
cover the number of civilians killed by cluster bombs alone,
<br>
according to this editorial:
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
&quot;How Many Civilians Were Killed By Cluster Bombs?
<br>
The Pentagon says 1: Iraq Body Count says at least 200.
<br>
<p>It is understandable that the US government should wish to play down
<br>
the damage done to Iraqi civilians by cluster bombs. The rules of
<br>
war prohibit the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons. Cluster
<br>
bombs are weapons which are incapable of being used in a manner that
<br>
complies with the obligation to distinguish between civilians and
<br>
combatants. Those who use them in civilian areas therefore open
<br>
themselves to charges of war crimes.
<br>
<p>Even so, last month's claim by the Pentagon that only one civilian
<br>
has died from cluster bombing is breathtaking in its audacious
<br>
distortion of reality. General Richard Myers, chairman of the
<br>
military's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Friday 25th April:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Only one of the nearly 1,500 cluster bombs used by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coalition forces in Iraq resulted in civilian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casualties. An initial review of all cluster
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;munitions used and the targets they were used on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicate that only 26 of those approximately 1,500
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hit targets within 1,500 feet of civilian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighborhoods. And there's been only one recorded
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case of collateral damage from cluster munitions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noted so far. &gt;&gt; (1)
<br>
<p>But this was only part of the picture, for:
<br>
<p>[...]Myers did not mention surface-launched cluster munitions, which
<br>
are believed to have caused many more civilian casualties.
<br>
<p>&quot;To imply that cluster munitions caused virtually no harm to Iraqi
<br>
civilians is highly disingenuous,&quot; said Kenneth Roth, executive
<br>
director of Human Rights Watch. Instead of whitewashing the facts,
<br>
the Pentagon needs to come clean about the Army's use of cluster
<br>
munitions, which has been much more fatal to civilians. (2)

<p>I would think that the extropians list of all places would appreciate
<br>
a systematic and as comprehensive and unbiased as possible approach to
<br>
gathering information on a subject. In this case, the subject is the
<br>
number of Iraqi civilians who died in the Iraq War.

<br>
Methodology
<br>
<p>from that web page:
<br>
<p>The IRAQ BODY COUNT Project
<br>
<p>This is a Human Security project to establish an independent and
<br>
comprehensive public database of media-reported civilian deaths in
<br>
Iraq resulting directly from military actions by the USA and its
<br>
allies in 2003. Results and totals are continually updated and made
<br>
immediately available on this page and on various IBC counters which
<br>
may be freely displayed on any website, where they will be
<br>
automatically updated without further intervention. Casualty figures
<br>
are derived from a comprehensive survey of online media reports.
<br>
Where these sources report differing figures, the range (a minimum
<br>
and a maximum) are given. All results are independently reviewed and
<br>
error-checked by at least three members of the Iraq Body Count
<br>
project team before publication.
<br>
<p>The project takes as its starting point and builds upon the earlier
<br>
work of Professor Marc Herold who has produced the most
<br>
comprehensive tabulation of civilian deaths in the war on
<br>
Afghanistan from October 2001 to the present, and the methodology
<br>
has been designed in close consultation with him.
<br>
<p>Professor Herold commented: &quot;I strongly support this initiative. The
<br>
counting of civilian dead looms ever more importantly for at least
<br>
two reasons: military sources and their corporate mainstream media
<br>
backers seek to portray the advent of precision guided weaponry as
<br>
inflicting at most, minor, incidental civilian casualties when, in
<br>
truth, such is is not the case; and the major source of opposition
<br>
to these modern 'wars' remains an informed, articulate general
<br>
public which retains a commitment to the international humanitarian
<br>
covenants of war at a time when most organized bodies and so-called
<br>
'experts' have walked away from them&quot;.
<br>
<p><p>Rationale:
<br>
<p>Adversities such as wars and civil wars threaten the survival and
<br>
dignity of millions of people. The victims of these conflicts are
<br>
primarily, if not almost exclusively, civilians - ordinary men and
<br>
women. Civilian casualties are the most unacceptable consequence of
<br>
all wars. Each civilian death is a tragedy and should never be
<br>
regarded as the cost of achieving our countries war aims, because
<br>
it is not we who are paying this price. One in four killed in the US
<br>
war on Afghanistan were civilians, and in Yugoslavia the proportion
<br>
was even higher. We believe it is a moral and humanitarian duty for
<br>
each such death to be recorded, publicised, given the weight it
<br>
deserves and, where possible, investigated to establish whether
<br>
there are grounds for criminal proceedings.
<br>
<p>Traditionally, security threats were examined in the context of
<br>
&quot;state security&quot;, i.e. the protection of the state, its boundaries,
<br>
people, institutions and values from external attacks. States set up
<br>
powerful military systems to defend themselves. People were
<br>
considered to be assured of their security through the protection
<br>
extended by the state. Recent history, however, shows that the
<br>
states as &quot;protector of people&quot; frequently come to play ineffective
<br>
if not adversarial roles. They showed no serious interest in
<br>
documenting and investigating the civilian deaths and their causes.
<br>
The governments of victor states certainly have almost no interest
<br>
in doing this during the conduct of military campaigns. Proponents
<br>
of modern warfare also make much of the claim that their weapons
<br>
are smart or precision guided. Civilian deaths give the lie to
<br>
such claims. Recent examples demonstrate that no air-launched weapon
<br>
can avoid civilian deaths.
<br>
<p>The UN Secretary-General has called the world community to advance a
<br>
new human-centred approach to these problems. As a contribution to
<br>
this effort, the Commission on Human Security (CHS) first met in New
<br>
York in June 2001 and held its second meeting in Tokyo in December
<br>
2001. The Iraq Body Count project is a direct response to this
<br>
agenda of Human Security.
<br>
<p>The Iraq Body Count project aims to promote public understanding,
<br>
engagement and support for the human dimension in wars by providing
<br>
a reliable and up-to-date documentation of civilian casualties in
<br>
the event of a US-led war in 2003 in the country. The duty of
<br>
recorder falls particularly heavily on the ordinary citizens of
<br>
those states whose military forces cause the deaths. In the current
<br>
crisis, this responsibility must be borne predominantly by citizens
<br>
of the USA and the UK.
<br>
<p>It is accepted that war causes many dire consequences for the
<br>
civilian population even if they are not directly killed or injured
<br>
in military strikes. They may suffer long-term injury or illness (as
<br>
a result, for instance of radiation, post-conflict contact with
<br>
unexploded munitions, pollution due to spillage of toxic materials).
<br>
UN estimates suggest that a war in Iraq would create starvation and
<br>
homelessness for millions. A widely-leaked UN report on the
<br>
humanitarian consequences of a US-led war in Iraq has estimated that
<br>
the conflict would create two million refugees. (BBC News, 28
<br>
January, 2003, 07:38 GMT) People may suffer deep psychological
<br>
trauma, miscarriage, bereavement, dislocation, and loss of home and
<br>
property. Destruction of civil infrastructure can have effects which
<br>
last for generations. These factors undoubtedly cause many further
<br>
deaths. However, documenting and assigning responsibility for such
<br>
effects requires long-term on the ground resources. Immediate
<br>
deaths and injuries through military strikes can be pinpointed in
<br>
place and time, and responsibility straightforwardly attributed to
<br>
the weapon that caused the death or injury.
<br>
<p>This project aims to record single-mindedly and on a virtually
<br>
real-time basis one key and immutable index of the fruits of war:
<br>
the death toll of innocents. The full extent of this has often gone
<br>
unnoticed until long after a war has ended, if at all. One reason is
<br>
that reports of incidents where civilians have been killed are
<br>
scattered in different news sources and spread over time: one or two
<br>
killed here, a few dozen there, with only major incidents (such as
<br>
the attack on the Al-Amariyah bomb shelter where hundreds of women,
<br>
children and elderly were incinerated alive) being guaranteed
<br>
headline coverage. But the smaller numbers quickly add up: and
<br>
however many civilians are killed in the onslaught on Iraq, their
<br>
death toll should not go unnoticed by those who are paying  in
<br>
taxes  for their slaughter. It is to these all too easily
<br>
disregarded victims of violence that Iraq Body Count is dedicated,
<br>
and we are resolute that they, too, shall have their memorials.

<br>
<p>For a source to be considered acceptable to this project it must
<br>
comply with the following standards: (1) site updated at least
<br>
daily; (2) all stories separately archived on the site, with a
<br>
unique url (see Note 1 below); (3) source widely cited or referenced
<br>
by other sources; (4) English Language site; (5) fully public
<br>
(preferably free) web-access.
<br>
<p>The project relies on the professional rigour of the approved
<br>
reporting agencies. It is assumed that any agency that has attained
<br>
a respected international status operates its own rigorous checks
<br>
before publishing items (including, where possible, eye-witness and
<br>
confidential sources). By requiring that two independent agencies
<br>
publish a report before we are willing to add it to the count, we
<br>
are premising our own count on the self-correcting nature of the
<br>
increasingly inter-connected international media network.
<br>
<p>Note 1. Some sites remove items after a given time period, change
<br>
their urls, or place them in archives with inadequate search
<br>
engines. For this reason it is project policy that urls of sources
<br>
are NOT published on the iraqbodycount site.
<br>
<p>3. Data extraction
<br>
<p>Data extraction policy is based on 3 criteria, some of which
<br>
work in opposite directions.
<br>
<p>a.Sufficient information must be extracted to ensure that each
<br>
incident is differentiated from proximate incidents with which
<br>
it could be potentially confused. b.Economy of data extraction
<br>
is required, for efficiency of both production and public
<br>
scrutiny. c.Data extraction should be uniform, so that the same
<br>
information is available for the vast majority of incidents.
<br>
This is best guaranteed by restricting the number of items of
<br>
information per incident to the core facts that most news
<br>
reports tend to include.
<br>
<p>The pragmatic tensions in the above have led to the decision to
<br>
extract the following information only for each incident:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Date of incident
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time of incident
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Location of incident
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Target as stated by military sources
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weapon (munitions or delivery vehicle)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum civilian deaths (see Note 2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum civilian deaths (see Note 2)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources (at least two sources from the list in 
<br>
section 2 above)
<br>
<p>Reliability of data extraction will be increased by ensuring that
<br>
each data extraction is checked and signed off by two further
<br>
independent scrutineers prior to publication, and all data entries
<br>
will be kept under review should further details become available at
<br>
a later date.
<br>
<p>Note 2. Definitions of minimum and maximum
<br>
<p>Reports of numbers dead vary across sources. On-the-ground
<br>
uncertainties and potential political bias can result in a range of
<br>
figures reported for the same incident. To reflect this variation,
<br>
each incident will be associated with a minimum and maximum reported
<br>
number of deaths. No number will be entered into the count unless it
<br>
meets the criteria in the following paragraphs. This conservative
<br>
approach allows relative certainty about the minimum.
<br>
<p>Maximum deaths. This is the highest number of civilian deaths
<br>
published by at least two of our approved list of news media
<br>
sources.
<br>
<p>Minimum deaths. This is the same as the maximum, unless at least two
<br>
of the listed news media sources publish a lower number. In this
<br>
case, the lower number is entered as the minimum. The minimum can be
<br>
zero if there is a report of &quot;zero deaths&quot; from two of our sources.
<br>
&quot;Unable to confirm any deaths&quot; or similar wording (as in an official
<br>
statement) does NOT amount to a report of zero, and will NOT lead to
<br>
an entry of &quot;0&quot; in the minimum column.
<br>
<p>As a further conservative measure, when the wording used in both
<br>
reports refers to &quot;people&quot; instead of civilians, we will include the
<br>
total figure as a maximum but enter &quot;0&quot; into the minimum column
<br>
unless details are present clearly identifying some or all of the
<br>
dead as civilian - in this case the number of identifiable civilians
<br>
will be entered into the minimum column instead of &quot;0&quot;. The word
<br>
&quot;family&quot; will be interpreted in this context as meaning 3 civilians.

<br>
<p>4. Data storage
<br>
<p>Although it is expected that the majority of sources will remain
<br>
accessible on the web site from which they were drawn, the project
<br>
will create a secure archive of all original sources (in both
<br>
electronic and paper form). Where judged appropriate by the project
<br>
team, this data may be released to bona-fide enquirers, for
<br>
verification purposes. At an appropriate juncture, the entire
<br>
archive will be passed to an institution of public record (such as a
<br>
University or National Library) for permanent access by bona-fide
<br>
researchers. The copyright of original sources will remain with the
<br>
originators. The copyright of the Iraq Body Count data extraction
<br>
remains with the named researchers on the project (see About us).
<br>
<p>5. Publication of data (including conditions of use)
<br>
<p>Once verified through the processes described in section 3 above,
<br>
each new incident will be added as a new line on a spreadsheet
<br>
database which will be updated regularly (at least daily) on the
<br>
www.iraqbodycount.org site. The total minimum and maximum deaths
<br>
will be automatically updated, and will feed through to all remotely
<br>
positioned web-counters donwloaded from the site.
<br>
<p>Permission is granted for any individual or agency to download and
<br>
display any of the web counters available on this site, provided
<br>
that the link back to the www.iraqbodycount.org site is not disabled
<br>
or otherwise tampered with when displayed on a live interactive
<br>
web-site. Permission is also granted for cut-and-paste downloads of
<br>
the spreadsheet database listing each incident. All press and
<br>
non-commercial uses are permitted. Other commercial uses are
<br>
prohibited without explicit permission (contact
<br>
<a href="mailto:info@iraqbodycount.org?Subject=Re:%20[IRAQ]%20RE:%20Name%20Calling%20vs.%20Ad%20Hominem">info@iraqbodycount.org</a>).
<br>
<p>We request that you acknowledge any use of the Iraq Body Count data
<br>
base or its methodology by mentioning either the project name (&quot;Iraq
<br>
Body Count&quot;) or the url (www.iraqbodycount.org) or the names of the
<br>
principal researchers, Hamit Dardagan and John Sloboda.
<br>
<p>6. Limitations and scope of enquiry:
<br>
<p>Any project has limitations and boundaries. Here are some FAQs about
<br>
this topic and our answers to them.
<br>
<p>Why dont you report all civilian deaths in Iraq since the 1991 Gulf
<br>
War ended?
<br>
<p>Our decision to stick with deaths from Jan 2003 is mainly tactical,
<br>
and based on the resources we have. We would rather provide one
<br>
stream of verifiable evidence to a high degree of reliablity than
<br>
spread ourselves too thin. Current deaths are more newsworthy than
<br>
past deaths, and will be of more interest to the general websites
<br>
who will carry the IBC Web Counters. We agree that reckoning total
<br>
deaths since 1991 is a very worthwhile project. We would be happy to
<br>
support someone wanting to do this, but we can't manage it ourselves
<br>
with current resources.
<br>
<p>Why don't you report civilian injuries as well as deaths?
<br>
<p>Injuries are difficult to quantify. Anything from shock to loss of
<br>
limb can be classified as an injury. Also, injuries can recover, so
<br>
that by the time there is independent verification the injury can
<br>
have healed. The level of resource we would need to track and
<br>
categorise the far higher number of injuries would likely overwhelm
<br>
our resources. Deaths are irreversible and immutable. Again, they
<br>
are the most &quot;newsworthy&quot; tip of the iceberg, and the greatest crime
<br>
against innocents.
<br>
<p>&quot;Does your count include deaths from indirect causes?&quot;
<br>
<p>Each side can readily claim that indirectly-caused deaths are the
<br>
&quot;fault&quot; of the other side or, where long-term illnesses and genetic
<br>
disorders are concerned, &quot;due to other causes.&quot; Our methodology
<br>
requires that specific deaths attributed to US-led military actions
<br>
are carried in at least two reports from our approved sources. This
<br>
includes deaths resulting from the destruction of water treatment
<br>
plants or any other lethal effects on the civilian population. The
<br>
test for us remains whether the bullet (or equivalent) is attributed
<br>
to a piece of weaponry where the trigger was pulled by a US or
<br>
allied finger, or is due to &quot;collateral damage&quot; by either side (with
<br>
the burden of responsibility falling squarely on the shoulders of
<br>
those who initiate war without UN Security Council authorization).
<br>
We agree that deaths from any deliberate source are an equal
<br>
outrage, but in this project we want to only record those deaths to
<br>
which we can unambiguously hold our own leaders to account. In
<br>
short, we record all civilians deaths attributed to our military
<br>
intervention in Iraq.
<br>
<p>(The above FAQ does not apply to sanctions; although we are opposed
<br>
to them, our study deals with the consequences of our current
<br>
military actions in Iraq. It has also been newly revised due to our
<br>
growing awareness that we were too narrowly-focused on bombs and
<br>
other conventional weapons, neglecting the deadly effects of
<br>
disrupted food, water, electricity and medical supplies. These
<br>
effects, though relatively small at the outset of a war, are likely
<br>
to become much more significant as time passes, and we will monitor
<br>
media reports accordingly.)
<br>
<p>Won't your count simply be a compilation of propaganda?
<br>
<p>We acknowledge that many parties to this conflict will have an
<br>
interest in manipulating casualty figures for political ends. There
<br>
is no such thing (and will probably never be such a thing) as an
<br>
&quot;wholly accurate&quot; figure, which could accepted as historical truth
<br>
by all parties. This is why we will always publish a minimum and a
<br>
maximum for each reported incident. Some sources may wish to
<br>
over-report casualties. Others may wish to under-report them. Our
<br>
methodology is not biased towards &quot;propaganda&quot; from any particular
<br>
protagonist in the conflict. We will faithfully reflect the full
<br>
range of reported deaths in our sources. These sources, which are
<br>
predominantly Western (including long established press agencies
<br>
such as Reuters and Associated Press) are unlikely to suppress
<br>
conservative estimates which can act as a corrective to inflated
<br>
claims. We rely on the combined, and self-correcting,
<br>
professionalism of the world's press to deliver meaningful maxima
<br>
and minima for our count.
<br>
<p>Will you co-operate with other similar projects?
<br>
<p>Many projects are needed to evaluate the full human cost of this
<br>
war. We value them all, but this one is ours. We need to ensure that
<br>
our study is focused and that its intent, scope and limits are
<br>
widely and clearly understood. We will certainly build up and
<br>
maintain our set of links to projects doing related work so that
<br>
viewers of this site can be pointed to related activity.
