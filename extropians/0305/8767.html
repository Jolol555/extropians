</em><br>
<p>Spike, thanks for confirming this.  I'm going to have to see if
<br>
my rather slow memory neurons can recall more of this.  (See
<br>
my comments to Eli's msg. regarding what I can recall.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... when I argued that we might have a long period (millions of years

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It is still an open question as to whether or not one
<br>
optimal architecture is not based on a &quot;stellar&quot; approach.
<br>
Gravity confines matter and drives fusion.  I will agree
<br>
that controlled fusion is a much better process for
<br>
&quot;managed&quot; (extropic) energy production.  But I haven't
<br>
seen any arguments presented that the best architectures
<br>
for the allocation of matter for controlled fusion energy
<br>
production would not require the sacrifice of such matter
<br>
from the actual computronium.  I.e. You can use your
<br>
energy sources more efficiently but you have to sacrifice
<br>
CPU cycles to do so.
<br>
<p>From Eli's perspective (perhaps) -- to maximize the intelligence
<br>
of the AI it may very well be necessary to waste energy.
<br>
<p>In your terms (perhaps) -- to minimize wasting energy it
<br>
may require producing a computronium matrix with significantly
<br>
less capacity to host AIs or uploads.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer's notion has considerable power: any logical growing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI will naturally calculate its theoretical upper bounds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then scramble like hell to achieve that level.
</em><br>
<p>This statement I agree with.  But from a computer science
<br>
and biological standpoint I would argue that it *cannot*
<br>
know what the &quot;upper bounds&quot; are.  The phase space of what
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; can explore is simply too large.  All you
<br>
can do is explore some corner of it.  So the best one can
<br>
do is optimize the architecture of energy production and
<br>
consumption for a specific variant of &quot;intelligence&quot;.
<br>
The best architecture to do voice recognition may not
<br>
be the best architecture to do face recognition and
<br>
they may have *very* different energy consumption
<br>
requirements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would mean stopping the absurd waste of energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pouring out into cold dead space from the stars.
</em><br>
<p>This is true -- but whether it means doing star-lifting
<br>
or some other creative approach to managing star downsizing
<br>
and therefore slowing stellar evolution is open to debate.
<br>
<p>It is an important question as to how many cycles can
<br>
I get in what amount of &quot;real&quot; time and what is the most
<br>
efficient way to achieve that?
<br>
<p>I'll completely agree with the idea that wasting energy
<br>
radiating it into space is probably not extropic (which
<br>
is the point behind Dyson shells and MBrains).  *But*
<br>
that does not immediately translate into the idea that
<br>
one must dismantle stars or find some other process
<br>
by which to perform explicitly controlled energy production
<br>
using the resources they contain.
<br>
<p>The devil is in the details here and I'll need to see
<br>
those details before I'm convinced.
<br>
<p>Robert
