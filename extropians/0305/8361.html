<em>&gt; I don't mean to address this to you in particular, Ron, but can we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop talking about The Left and The Right, now? It's worse than TV.
</em><br>
<p>It is interesting that TV began openly talking about left vs. right---
<br>
in a way that superficially put them on an equal par, and gives its
<br>
entire (and insidious) endorsement to the objective existence of such---
<br>
only during the last decade or so!
<br>
<p>I have to admit that I kind of liked that.  For it had been an objective
<br>
part of reality for me since age 12, and so I had the same feeling as I
<br>
do now when people finally freely admit that the universe is infinite.
<br>
(Yay Bruno.)
<br>
<p>But polarization can be damaging, and so your point is interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Somebody's already pointed out how extropians should be (indeed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to be?) above this kind of egregious false dichotomy.
</em><br>
<p>But is it really false?  Now yes, it's true that *extropians* don't
<br>
fit easily onto the usual left right continuum, and so that's why
<br>
the Nolan chart exists.  Though wordier, and more complicated, it
<br>
gives a better picture of the reality, it seems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Political issues can be relevant, but we're just spiraling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further down into the pit of entrenched and polarised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream debate where the very structure of the argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guarantees no progress will ever be made.
</em><br>
<p>I have the feeling that you are just very sad to be learning
<br>
about the entrenchments that do exist, and are in most ways
<br>
in my opinion, quite inevitable.  This is the same feeling I
<br>
get when young people I know are filled with dismay upon
<br>
learning that our universe is just atoms in the void---cold,
<br>
empty, with no moving Spirits and souls to guide things.
<br>
<p>You also hark after a &quot;progress&quot; that can be made.  In my
<br>
opinion, progress will only be made when the *reasons* for
<br>
political differences are better understood, and it can be
<br>
fathomed how it is possible for highly intelligent people
<br>
who have approximately the same Western values to systematically
<br>
disagree.  Even then, I fear, the main progress will not be in
<br>
*resolving* these differences (unlike in science, where ultimately
<br>
all that may be needed often for the new generation is for a more 
<br>
powerful piece of apparatus to be built).
<br>
<p>Thus, IMO progress will arise as we come to understand how
<br>
it is that a person with dispositions {X} growing up in
<br>
environmental conditions {Y} at a time T in history starts
<br>
to lean left or right, or becomes a libertarian, or
<br>
&quot;progressive&quot;, or whatever.
<br>
<p>So I fear that the answer to your question &quot;can't we do better
<br>
than this?&quot; may sadly be &quot;no&quot;.
<br>
<p>Lee
