<p><em>&gt; ### But is 7-ketocholesterol the non-degradable molecular species?

<em>&gt; According to: Lyons MA. Brown AJ.Metabolism of an oxysterol,

<em>&gt; 7-ketocholesterol, by sterol 27-hydroxylase in HepG2 cells.Lipids.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 36(7):701-11, 2001 Jul., it is well-metabolized in the liver.
</em><br>
<p>Many thanks for this ref - I was unaware of this work.  Either 7-KC is
<br>
a species that is degraded in the liver but not elsewhere (which must
<br>
not be ruled out, because the liver can afford to make toxic things
<br>
and then chuck them out into the bile, an option that macrophages do
<br>
not have), or, like native cholesterol, it accumulates as a secondary
<br>
side-effect of the accumulation of other stuff that must not be let
<br>
out into the cytosol.  More on this latter possibility below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### If the balance is tilted towards formation of foam cells (e.g. by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ingestion of dietary poisons, like trans-fatty acids, or by genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors in familial hypercholesterolemias), you will have them early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, and you could have your first heart attack in grade school (or in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your forties if you have only margarine going against you).
</em><br>
<p>Right.  My point was that the veiw of Lusis (and others) is that early
<br>
foam cell accumulation is the norm.  But see below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We already discussed reversibility of atherosclerosis, I think. Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can observe a bulk reduction in the atheromas in human carotids
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with some dietary interventions (vit. B supplementation) as measured by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doppler sonography, the majority of pathologically relevant material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for artery occlusion is apparently digestible and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removed if the equilibrium is forced back towards lipid removal. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are truly indigestible molecular species present in the atheroma,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they would form only a part of it, and would not have a pathological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significance in the age range that humans currently achieve.
</em><br>
<p>All true.  I mentioned one aspect of this earlier -- that there will
<br>
always be a proportion of stuff in the lysosomal compartment that is
<br>
digestible (and, indeed, being digested), and that is the material to
<br>
which your logic correctly applies.  But that presumably applies only
<br>
to intact cells, not to the acellular core.  I couldn't find a ref to
<br>
your claim that the **majority** of pathologically relevant material
<br>
in late-stage (artery-occluding) plaques is apparently digestible --
<br>
please provide it.
<br>
<p>However, there's another important point re foam cells.  It's clear
<br>
that a lot of what's in foam cells is straight, native cholesterol or
<br>
cholesteryl ester.  Why?  The prevailing interpretation, I believe,
<br>
is that there is a modified cholesterol species present in the cells'
<br>
lysosomes which will get out if the normal cholesterol efflux system
<br>
proceeds, so that system is arrested (or at least slowed) to protect
<br>
the cell.  So then, the question becomes whether pre-foam cells --
<br>
healthy arterial macrophages that have begun to accumulate stuff but
<br>
have not yet become engorged -- can be isolated and their lysosomal
<br>
contents analysed for such products, which would be present at higher
<br>
relative concentrations than in more advanced cells.  Might be a hard
<br>
experiment; I think looking at the acellular core of advanced lesions
<br>
will be more efficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Lusis mentions the early fatty streaks without qualifications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - but AFAIK, there are large differences in the age of onset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atherosclerosis between ethic groups. The Japanese, who were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject group in Homa's study, seem to develop lesions later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (presumably due to lifestyle factors).
</em><br>
<p>Right, but that's a difference concerning frank atherosclerosis, not
<br>
foam cells.  But I haven't found literature on whether or not foam cell
<br>
accumulation occurs later in Japanese -- it would certainly be good to
<br>
know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Homa didn't do a random sampling of the aorta - all samples were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken from predefined locations.
</em><br>
<p>My poor use of &quot;random&quot;.  I just meant that it may be that essentially
<br>
all 10-year-olds really do have foam cells in their aorta, but that
<br>
different people have them in different places, such that a sample of
<br>
people may give some with none in any of the regions examined.  Also,
<br>
the paper pooled the observations from all the regions, so we don't
<br>
know whether &quot;no lesion in x%&quot; means none in any of the places for x%
<br>
of subjects of none in x% of samples.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Chinnery specified the &quot;maintenance of wild-type mechanism&quot;, yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but AFAIK he didn't say that random fluctuations are irreversible and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot push the total number of genomes back down (except when driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to homoplasmy).
</em><br>
<p>He said that the total number can fall due to random fluctuations, but
<br>
not be &quot;pushed&quot; down.  That's where the bias in directionality comes
<br>
from: there is no push either way when the number of wild-types is
<br>
sufficient, but there's an upward push when it isn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; His model applies to functionally neutral mutations (Am J Hum Genet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2001; 68: 80206.), with the maintenance of wild-type being an add-on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the hypothesis, meant to help explain MERRF-like phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, sorry, sure, yes, I was talking about this &quot;add-on&quot; the whole time.
<br>
It's entirely possible that something like what Chinnery discusses is
<br>
indeed correct for neutral mutations, but I've only been discussing
<br>
loss-of-function ones.  Apologies for the confusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are threshold effects for derangements of mito function by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various mutations, ranging from 30 to 95% mutated genomes needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce a detectable pathology. The cell cannot read the quality of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mtDNA genomes directly (at least, so we believe), so it must use a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biochemical sensor to decide when to push mtDNA replication higher.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the biochemical derangements appear late because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thresholds, even if the cell tries to maintain a certain constant level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mito function, it will only react with proliferation to advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heteroplasmy, and in an inconsistent, tissue- and mutation-specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner, just as seen in real life.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but it's not just as seen in real life: this is the whole problem.
<br>
We see two clear deviations from real life in his model: (1) his model
<br>
predicts lots of proliferation at modest heteroplasmy (say, under 50%),
<br>
and (2) it predicts (for parameters chosen to give the observed number
<br>
of COX-negative cells) a lot more heteroplasmic cells than homoplasmic
<br>
(or very nearly) mutant cells.  Thresholds don't help re the former,
<br>
because in Chinnery's model the only reason there's a threshold is that
<br>
there's a maximum number of mt genomes in total (wt plus mutant).  Re
<br>
the latter, Chinnery has even cited Brierley 1998 from the same lab in
<br>
support of his prediction, when it explicitly shows the opposite!!
<br>
Tissue- and mutation-specificity is hard to interpret, of course, since
<br>
it depends on mutation rate as well as on selective advantage or lack
<br>
of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Is it in review? I can't find it on Medline.
</em><br>
<p>Capps GJ, Samuels DC, Chinnery PF.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Well, one way or another, large neurons would be generally much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely to be either COX-negative or dying, by more than an order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of magnitude.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but not observably so, for the reasons I gave.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; our data show that there is a significant difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the frequency of mutations in the D-loop and in the protein-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coding regions, by almost an order of magnitude.
</em><br>
<p>Right -- in fact if you only got &quot;almost an OOM&quot; you saw less of a
<br>
difference than most have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If all the mutations we observe were due to degradation of the DNA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then we would expect that the frequency would be the same for both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas, unless there is a significant influence from e.g. SSB vs. MTFA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions.
</em><br>
<p>Plus, e.g., that the D-loop is where the mtDNA is attached to the inner
<br>
membrane (nasty place to be).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the size of the fragmented, highly-oxidized mtDNA in Suter's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article is about .2 to .5 Mb. We amplified fragments of 1 kb to 4 kb,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and gel-purified the DNA to exclude smaller fragments, in both cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding the same overall mutation frequencies, indicating that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations are not from the oxidized mtDNA which would be excluded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our approach, especially with the longer PCR products.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, most types of DNA damage seem to block PCR rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduce errors, which is the basis of some methods for adduct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detection.
</em><br>
<p>Really?  I thought only a few types block PCR (eg thymine dimers).
<br>
But I'm not well up on that, so I take your word for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, I just read the abstract of your paper in Protoplasma - sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intriguing, but the full text is not available online. Could you send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me a copy?
</em><br>
<p>I actually don't have full-text access, even though Cambridge does get
<br>
the journal in hard copy.  If you (or anyone else reading!) can get it
<br>
