<em>&gt; &gt; I just replied to your post because it was the latest one
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reified Thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just out of curiosity, do you consider Hot and Cold to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reified Things?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in the sense that they are useful simplifications of reality. The
<br>
Left, like Hot, is not a real thing, but unlike Hot, it isn't useful
<br>
either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Entrenchment, as you know, happens without labels too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When at work, for example, a certain proposal appeals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to some people and not others, it seems to me that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost exactly the same thing transpires.  Probably it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only when the same teams keep cropping up against each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other that they acquire labels, but it would be interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to know if the labels really do make things worse.  So far,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've not seen much indication that they do.
</em><br>
<p>In my (lack of) experience, I've found that the particular labels Left
<br>
and Right are used solely as weapons in a fight, not tools in an
<br>
argument. Lumping somebody in with, say, The Right, implies they support
<br>
a whole lot more baggage than may be the case, usually in the attempted
<br>
construction of a straw man.
<br>
<p>You're certainly right that having the same teams keep cropping up against
<br>
each other might suggest a common cause, but I would be extremely wary
<br>
of attributing it to something as simple as traditional models of
<br>
political attitudes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Cooperation clearly evolved at some point, memetically or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genetically, but the animal instinct to split the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into two simple groups still prevails occasionally. Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even most of the time. [Yes!]  I consider &quot;Me vs. Him&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Us vs. Them&quot;, &quot;This tribe vs. That tribe&quot;, &quot;This nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vs. That nation&quot;, &quot;This ideology vs. That ideology&quot; to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manifestations of the same thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And when it's naturally absent, there often appears to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real need for it, e.g., the intense rivalry between high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools, or even siblings, and the parties appear even to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take steps to create it.
</em><br>
<p>Oh sure, competition and rivalry are fine, but as you point out, we go
<br>
out of our way to create a bipolar worldview, even when that may not be
<br>
the case. I don't want to say &quot;Let's all be friends! We're all on the
<br>
same side!&quot; but there are cases where simplistic one/zero yes/no
<br>
right/wrong interpretations just won't do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Whatever the cause is, I believe it is a quirk of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; selection that should, at least in principle, yield to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superrationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does anyone believe in &quot;superrationality&quot; in game theory 
</em><br>
<p>Ack. Bad choice of word. What I should have said was &quot;a calm detached
<br>
perspective&quot; perhaps.
