<p>I wish I didn't agree with you.  Gore would have been much more polite 
<br>
about things, but many of the contracts seem to have been let before the 
<br>
election was held, which makes one wonder slightly just how significant 
<br>
it would have been.  My general impression is that the Democrats are 
<br>
more concerned with people liking them, and the Republicans are more 
<br>
concerned with shoring up their own power.  Neither of those, however, 
<br>
translate directly into action, and there appears to be an underlying 
<br>
consensus between the parties as to the actions to be taken.  One does 
<br>
wonder what the rationale is.  The fact that it's kept secret does not 
<br>
automatically mean that it's something to be ashamed of, it might just 
<br>
mean that they don't believe that they could explain it in news-bytes, 
<br>
or that it depends on keeping it's future actions secret from other 
<br>
countries/power-groups.  Still, one must bear in mind that a (small) 
<br>
group in control of power will almost always decide on actions that 
<br>
retain it's control over the power, however it may have to justify them 
<br>
to itself.  Self-interest can warp ones decisions unseen, and will not 
<br>
usually be noticed by the beneficiaries, who will be righteously 
<br>
indignant over claims that they are corruptly self-interested.  But how 
<br>
you evaluate what is in your self-interest will mould the final shape of 
<br>
the decisions.
<br>
<p>That said, Gore appeared from the first to be the &quot;choosen looser&quot; in 
<br>
the election (bland, unemotional, unable to motivate people).  And he 
<br>
was as fervently in favor of increased centralized intelligence 
<br>
gathering and surveillance as Bush was.  Perhaps more so.  He was 
<br>
pushing that during Clinton's term.  Still, I got the impression that 
<br>
everyone was surprised as how hard it was to get Bush choosen.  (Why 
<br>
they wanted to is still a puzzle.)
