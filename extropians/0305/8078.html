<p>I have a huge supply of 800 mg tabs. I've forgotten where I obtained it. I
<br>
did not however obtain it through health insurance (I probably couldn't do
<br>
so even I tried as I am not diabetic). Metformin is however very cheap, as
<br>
medicines go. I split the tabs in half and take 1 or 2 half-tabs daily with
<br>
meals, depending on how glycemic my meals happen to be. I've tried taking
<br>
metformin in the absence of meals but in my case doing so tends to send my
<br>
blood sugar too low. Claims to the contrary (that metformin cannot cause
<br>
hypoglycemia) should be considered suspect, imo.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To be clear, the news re: Metformin is that it is a very good CR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mimic... not an AGE blocker. 
</em><br>
<p>Okay thanks. I have tried to find research to support this claim but
<br>
couldn't. Have you seen any? A couple of weeks ago I looked at the site of
<br>
the organization funded by LEF that makes the claim, but couldn't find
<br>
anything to substantiate it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There has been news recently on another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of AGE blocking via something called Benfotiamine:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.designinglogic.com/upload/www.aor.ca/proddetail.asp?prod_id=289">http://www.designinglogic.com/upload/www.aor.ca/proddetail.asp?prod_id=289</a>
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Benfotiamine&quot; appears to be ordinary thiamine (vitamin B-1). At least I did
<br>
not see any research on that site to suggest otherwise. I have seen in vitro
<br>
research that ordinary niacin (vitamin B-3) inhibits AGE formation as well.
