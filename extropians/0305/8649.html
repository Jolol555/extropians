</em><br>
<p>Just because humanity *did in fact* follow the path of agriculture to 
<br>
science, this doesn't mean that humanity *must* have followed this path. 
<br>
Now it seems to me there's a very strong argument that even if a band of 
<br>
hunter-gatherers invents literacy and some kind of social process with 
<br>
Bayes-structure (science is one example), agriculture would soon follow 
<br>
since it seems like a very obvious technology.  Nonetheless, agriculture 
<br>
is not really necessary in the sense that hunter-gatherers who were 
<br>
somehow absolutely forbidden from developing agriculture might have gotten 
<br>
quite a long distance, albeit more slowly, before they finally reached a 
<br>
bottleneck where they could go no farther without only a few people 
<br>
creating the food that everyone else eats.
<br>
<p>So while agriculture was a mistake that did in fact create powerful 
<br>
benefits, we must ask whether those benefits could have been obtained 
<br>
without the mistake.  In terms of correlations the answer is no; it would 
<br>
have been extremely difficult to set up a case where one event happened 
<br>
but not the other.  Causally the answer may be yes; the mistake may be 
<br>
inexorably correlated but not really *necessary*.
