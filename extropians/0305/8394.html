<p><em>&gt; I hadn't seen the Nolan chart before. Thanks for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointer. I still think it's just the two dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogue of the left/right fallacy, but less fallacious.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To increase the accuracy, should we add more dimensions?
</em><br>
<p>I think that this is a general epistemological point.  It's
<br>
almost as if there were a formula
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adequacy-of-statement = (truth-content)/conciseness
<br>
<p>So if someone could come up with a spiffy 3D Nolan chart,
<br>
then provided the numerator here made up for the increased
<br>
denominator, it would be seen by people as worthwhile.
<br>
<p>In general, &quot;the planets move around the sun in ellipses&quot;
<br>
is solid-gold IMO as truth.  Of course, &quot;every statement
<br>
must be further modified&quot;, and so it's *more* accurate
<br>
(but at a great cost in clarity) to say instead &quot;the planets
<br>
move around the sun in ellipses except for minor perturbations
<br>
induced by Jupiter and except for minor General Relativistic
<br>
corrections&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, a perfectly accurate chart would be the universe itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with all its unanalysable nonlinearity.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This remind me of the Myers-Briggs personality types. That partitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality into 16 groups, rather than 2. The granularity is increased,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and with it the accuracy, but it's still not perfect. Refining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissection would cover more edge cases, but increase the complexity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which such models are designed to reduce.
</em><br>
<p>Just so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe the underlying question is about simple, linear models of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex nonlinear phenomena. At what level of complexity does the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model cease to be sufficiently useful? At what level of simplicity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does the model cease to be sufficiently accurate?
</em><br>
<p>Worse, the answers will vary from person to person and from time to
<br>
time, and perhaps from situation to situation as well.  That's sort
<br>
of why I love things like &quot;planets move around the sun in ellipses&quot;,
<br>
and &quot;there are those of us on the Right, and those of them on the
<br>
Left, and so, it appears, to have always been&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I won't pretend to have thought hard enough about this to offer an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer, but I know the Left/Right model is so inaccurate that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invariably used as a weapon rather than a useful simplification.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, it is very unfortunate that it is used as a (ineffectual)
<br>
weapon.  To say someone is a &quot;right-wing superpatriot&quot; does come
<br>
across as insulting;  but I think that there are plenty of other
<br>
terms of abuse that the speaker could employ on his favorite targets
<br>
(e.g., &quot;loony anti-American&quot;), so somehow (call me crazy) I've always
<br>
had this feeling that it made for greater toleration, somehow, to
<br>
acknowledge the symmetry between ourselves and our adversaries, which
<br>
just might keep us from thinking them stupid, ignorant, misguided,
<br>
subhuman, mean-spirited, or malevolent by nature.
<br>
<p>So it's not &quot;invariably&quot; used as a weapon.
<br>
<p>Lee
