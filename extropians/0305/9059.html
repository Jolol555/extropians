R. Bradbury:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Well the last time I checked yeast were being used for the production
<br>
of some chemicals and/or pharmaceuticals.  And I think we have been
<br>
using them for a very long time to produce bread and beer.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I was hoping this will lead to vastly improved processes, for producing 
<br>
something futuristic; like &quot;yeast steaks&quot; - yeast that has the characteristics of 
<br>
beef, chicken, lamb, or fish, fruits etc. That way, no animals need be 
<br>
slaughtered, or fruits wouldn't depend on warm weather and the like. If your steak 
<br>
came from yeast or fungus we could mass produce food that people could enjoy, and 
<br>
produce it in hundreds of times the volume that it is currently raised.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A better base for this is bacteria, not yeast -- they replicate much
<br>
faster (down to 20 min per replication cycle) and some have photosynthetic
<br>
capabilities -- so they can use solar energy&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I believe that you are well-aware that Craig Ventner is financing such a 
<br>
research venture. Bateria may be the most optimal method to produce fuel, but I 
<br>
was looking to see if yeast-fungus might be the most practical-commercially 
<br>
ready means; if the research is significant.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;That was perhaps part of my point that I didn't make clear enough --
<br>
the timing of the cell cycle is very carefully regulated, in part
<br>
by some of the &quot;regulons&quot;.  Fully understanding the regulons allows
<br>
us to &quot;tweek&quot; them to make the cell cycle go faster -- or make the
<br>
cellular reproduction process be more reliable.  Net results are
<br>
the ability to grow organs faster and a decreased proability that
<br>
normal cells turn into cancerous cells. We really need to get the mammalian 
<br>
regulon -- but its perhaps only 3-5 times more complex than yeast.  Doable in 
<br>
3-5 years,
<br>
perhaps less.
<br>
<p>Robert&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I will bounce this info to my brother in law, who was an oncologist, and see 
<br>
he can provide an idea of what the real-world impact might actually be. Thanks 
<br>
mucho.
<br>
<p>Mitch
