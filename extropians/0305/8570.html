<p><em>&gt; ### Do you have a hypothesis as to what this difference might be? What

<p>Quite a few are known; luckily, one of my prospective collaborators on
<br>
this work, Keri Carpenter, has been at the forefront of research on
<br>
the chemical composition of atheroma for many years.  Mostly they are
<br>
oxidation products of cholesterol, such as 7-ketocholesterol.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A key question is, are there any other comparably legitimate

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### The dynamic equilibrium hypothesis.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you ever explained how that hypothesis can be reconciled
<br>
with the appearance of fatty streaks so young.  That's my main problem
<br>
with the hypothesis -- the advance of lipid deposition seems to be a
<br>
continuous, lifelong process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### I found the following: Homma S. Ishii T. Tsugane S. Hirose N.

<em>&gt; lesions. [Journal Article] Atherosclerosis. 128(1):85-95, 1997 Jan 3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently even at around age 79 you still find people with no intimal

</em><br>
<p>Thanks for this reference.  I would need to consult someone like Keri
<br>
to be sure, but I think the explanation is just random sampling of a
<br>
few sites within the aorta rather than examination of the whole aorta.
<br>
According to this paper's Fig 2, 2/3 of those in their 20s had no foam
<br>
cells; this is ostensibly at odds with the consensus (stated in, for
<br>
example, Jake Lusis's review in Nature 407:233) that they are usually
<br>
present in the first decade.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### I don't understand. The mutants take over mainly as a result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stochastic processes, with no clear mitochondrial proliferative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to partial loss of function. There is a substantial functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reserve of mitochondria, and the nucleus seems to maintain a constant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass of genomes (at least in some experimental paradigms), so there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no mitochondrial hyperproliferation until very late in the process, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all. Since the stochastic hypothesis makes no reference to the cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of hyperproliferation, merely predicting the emergence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COX-negativity, it is compatible with either hyperproliferation before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COX negativity, after, or none at all, if the cell simply decides not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to upregulate mitos. These two processes are most likely largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent, over large range of heteroplasmy levels.
</em><br>
<p>No, Chinnery's model *does* specify the cause of hyperproliferation.
<br>
He says that the cell maintains the same number of *functional* mt
<br>
genomes.  Hence, he concludes that the random fluctuation of wild-type
<br>
versus mutant genomes will push the number of mutant genomes up along
<br>
with the wild-type when the wild-type randomly diminish, but won't
<br>
push it down again when the wild-type randomly exceed the necessary
<br>
number.  Whereas in real life, just as you say, no clear mitochondrial
<br>
proliferative response to partial loss of function is seen.
<br>
<p>He has a new paper out about this in J Theor Biol which explains and
<br>
extends the model somewhat.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### In the CNS there are neurons with enormous differences in cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mass, from tiny interneurons to the giant alpha motor neurons. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giant ones do have a very active metabolism. If indeed single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deleterious mutations had a significant replicative advantage, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large neurons would die much faster than the interneurons, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the case.
</em><br>
<p>Um, hang on -- there are at least three things wrong with this logic.
<br>
First, neurons die of lots of things, not just OXPHOSlessness.  Second,
<br>
they don't necessarily die even of OXPHOSlessness, because if they did
<br>
then we wouldn't see COX-negative ones accumulating with age.  And third,
<br>
most brain regions (of whatever size) have far fewer COX-negative neurons
<br>
than the substantia nigra.  It could be that this is because they resist
<br>
apoptosis in the substantia nigra more than elsewhere, but chances are
<br>
that it's mutation rate, because of the H2O2 production associated with
<br>
dopamine synthesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, we know that the mutation level in single neurons in elderly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adults is in the range of 50 to 800 diverse aminoacid-changing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations per million bases (according to Simon and Beal), meaning that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than ninety percent of genomes are mutated, and without doubt many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them are deleterious. This leaves little place for a preferential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amplification of low psi or otherwise impaired mitos.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, not so fast.  Are you referring to Hum Mol Genet 11(2):133?  I'm
<br>
keeping an open mind about that study until the appearance of a ms in
<br>
preparation that that article cites, but it's not clear to me that
<br>
they made a compelling case for the reliability of their quantitation.
<br>
For example, they made no allowance for the isolation of mtDNA that
<br>
was in the process of being degraded because of damage (see Suter and
<br>
Richter, Biochemistry 38(1):459).  The acid test is the single-cell
<br>
analysis being done so effectively by Khrapko's group, who have now
<br>
started serious work on neurons (see Mech Ageing Dev 123(8):891 as a
<br>
starting point).  It's possible that only deletions clonally expand
<br>
and point mutations don't, but I doubt it.
