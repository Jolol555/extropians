<p>Spike, you raise an interesting point here.  And though I've
<br>
got the Handbook of Chemistry &amp; Physics open to the Vapor Pressure
<br>
pages I am not (at least without significantly more thought)
<br>
able to reasonably interpret the data (esp. the extent to which
<br>
ice would be worse than iron or better than LN2).  So I
<br>
cannot evaluate your assertion at this time.
<br>
<p>I would only make two points -- (1) it seems reasonable that one might
<br>
encase ice, LN2, etc. *within* a nanotube sheath and so classical
<br>
vapor pressure analysis may not apply. (2) The outer layers of
<br>
an MBrain *are* going to be very very cold -- you have to bear
<br>
in mind that computers tend to *like* it cold -- there is much less
<br>
disruption of the &quot;order&quot; by random molecular motions.  And I have
<br>
gone to some lengths in various papers to postulate precisely
<br>
how cold one might run.  It *is* very very cold (at least respective
<br>
to current &quot;standards&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, right, but of course we as humans need not actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever be uploaded to continue with my notion of Earth-origin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence bursting forth into the galaxy.
</em><br>
<p>I've got nothing wrong with the concept of an &quot;Earth-origin
<br>
intelligence&quot; (its the only &quot;intelligence&quot; we know of) but
<br>
I've got big problems with &quot;bursting forth into the galaxy&quot;.
<br>
The human body had *not* evolved to be able to do this --
<br>
there may be alien species out there that &quot;naturally&quot; have
<br>
these capabilities but *we* do not (i.e. &quot;space&quot; and &quot;humanity&quot;
<br>
are not something easily mixed).  So to &quot;reasonably&quot;
<br>
anticipate exploring the galaxy one is going to need to
<br>
improve the current standard life form to do it.  That
<br>
either means a significantly upgraded human genome or
<br>
AIs designed and built from scratch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be nice of course, but uploading of a meat brain is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a far more difficult problem than building an MBrain.
</em><br>
<p>Now, this is by far your most interesting claim.  And one that
<br>
many extropians should consider thinking about.
<br>
<p>The process of &quot;uploading&quot; of a meat brain is at this time mostly
<br>
a mystery to us.  In large part because I do not think we have a
<br>
robust understanding of things like motivations that are entirely
<br>
coded at the hormone level, self-awareness, self-direction, etc.
<br>
<p>But that does *not* imply that we might make very rapid progress
<br>
in this area over the next 5, 10 or 20 years (Anders might comment);
<br>
after all we *do* have the human genome in our hands at this time.
<br>
<p>But, on the other hand building an MBrain (at least in this solar
<br>
system) looks to be a thousand year project (look at my planetary
<br>
dismantlement times).  There may be some clever ways to speed this
<br>
up but I really doubt that improvements in physical mass processing
<br>
will exceed informational comprehension improvements over the next
<br>
century.  And I sincerely doubt that we would fail to understand
<br>
the human mind in a robust way over the next century (again Anders
<br>
might comment).
<br>
<p>So, I would conclude that uploads might well come first.
<br>
If that happens then it may be a very dangerous time.
<br>
(Both from Eliezer's perspective of non-friendly AIs
<br>
[I would assert that if one can upload, one can probably
<br>
generate a non-friendly AI fairly easily] as well as
<br>
the perspective of Robin's &quot;If Uploads Come First&quot;
<br>
(<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/uploads.html</a>) raise serious questions).
<br>
If that happens and a number of extropians aren't on the early
<br>
adopter list (so we can save each other in spite of ourselves)
<br>
then my bets would be that human civilization as we know it is toast.
<br>
<p>So things like the timing of MBrain construction and
<br>
sufficient understanding of the human brain to allow
<br>
uploading *are* significant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dont back away from it, Robert, your vision of an MBrain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is sheer brilliance.  Do maintain ownership of that idea.
</em><br>
<p>(thanks)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no need to assume we will do otherwise or colonize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; galaxy in any other form besides an enormous flock of interdependent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orbitting nodes.
</em><br>
<p>There is one minor detail in the evolution of civilizations worth
<br>
thinking about.
<br>
<p>That is the fact that being larger (more distributed) implies
<br>
that one thinks slower (due to speed of light limitations).
<br>
The most advanced civilizations want to become smaller,
<br>
not larger.  I think there is a significant lack of
<br>
exploration between the Fermi Paradox and the fact that
<br>
developing a greater intelligence most probably requires
<br>
becoming smaller.
<br>
<p>I think Anders begins to consider this issue with his
<br>
development of a &quot;Chronos&quot; neutronium brain -- but I
<br>
have significant problems with whether I/O from any
<br>
such entity is feasible.  (Or whether the bandwidth
<br>
of any external I/O can deal with the amount of internal
<br>
information being produced.)  [Side note to Anders
<br>
and others -- I'm not talking theories here -- I
<br>
want real no-magic-physics, yes-I-can-build-this-device
<br>
examples.]
<br>
<p>There is a quote from some one of the various documents of
<br>
SETI literature that I have read [the source I cannot remember] --
<br>
but the quote would in effect be &quot;If you give the theoreticians
<br>
*long* enough they can explain anything&quot;.  On the ExI list (at
<br>
least some, perhaps most of the time) you don't get that long.
<br>
