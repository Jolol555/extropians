<em>&gt; &gt; Until a few months before the war, gun ownership was restricted to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that Baath party membership was mandatory for many

</em><br>
<p>Yes, about a month before the war. Surprising, though, that so few were
<br>
used for their intended purpose, eh? Not really. Saddam may have had
<br>
delusions of Stalinistic patriotic uprising in his support, but who
<br>
thinks the people would actually use them when they'd already seen us
<br>
kick their butts a decade before and we'd just finished kicking the
<br>
butts of the Afghans, who up to that time were considered unconquerable
<br>
by the arab street.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would appreciate examples of an armed populace successfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolting against an oppressive government. Of course, one example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is right here in the USA. I know there are examples of a government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disarming the populace before instituting oppressive measures, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is not the  same thing.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, several examples here. Our original revolution, to start
<br>
with. Then there is the Texan War of Independence (from Mexico). Also
<br>
see the Whiskey Rebellion, in which the Feds declared 'victory' after
<br>
one aborted battle and let the rest of the rebels continue to avoid the
<br>
whiskey tax.
<br>
<p>There is the era of the Republic of Indian Stream and the Battle of
<br>
Indian Stream (against Canada) which almost started a war with Britain
<br>
in the 1830's and presaged Indian Stream's annexation into the US as
<br>
the northern tip of New Hampshire in the final border settlement that
<br>
had been brewing since the end of the Revolutionary War.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I support the 2nd ammendment, my feeling is that pragmatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it exists only to protect itself (and maybe parts of the first, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with religion).
</em><br>
<p>For practical purposes in the modern world, its primary utility is that
<br>
it would force an oppressive government to so eggregiously violate the
<br>
rights of those who refuse to be disarmed or otherwise oppressed with
<br>
public atrocities that public sympathy and pressure forces political
<br>
reforms. The Waco and Ruby Ridge episodes enraged so much of the US
<br>
public that the ATF was forced to reform, the FBI was curtailed a bit,
<br>
and the GOP regained congress.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem with the official secrecy we are seeing today is
<br>
that there is no oversight if any atrocities are committed against
<br>
American citizens.
