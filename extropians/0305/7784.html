<p>
Well, I finally decided to bite the bullet and try
<br>
CRON, starting yesterday after lunch.  I felt ok thru
<br>
this afternoon, apart from being irritable and hungry,
<br>
but when I went to get my Whopper and $1 salad for
<br>
lunch, I managed to drop the little cups of ketchup -
<br>
TWICE.  I've never done that before.  Even after
<br>
eating and downing my handful of supplements, I still
<br>
felt a little bit in a mental fog, and was really
<br>
drowsy for the rest of the afternoon at work.
<br>
<p>So, what if I were to add amphetamine to the mix?  My
<br>
mother was a speed (diet pill) freak bigtime thru a
<br>
large portion of her life and is still alive and well
<br>
in her mid-'80's.  Of course, she had a near genius IQ
<br>
to begin with, so any damage due to the speed would
<br>
have to be put against that.  
<br>
<p>I know that Rand allegedly used low-dosage amphetamine
<br>
- 5mg./day, I believe - for a long period of her later
<br>
life, including while writing Atlas Shrugged, but
<br>
then, she didn't live a very long or healthy life,
<br>
either.  And Roddenbury was reported to be a real
<br>
speed user, but he died young as well.  
<br>
<p>My mother used to win every single radio contest in my
<br>
home town - literally - for years.  They had this
<br>
ongoing contest in which the clues were planted in the
<br>
songs being played, etc., and the station finally had
<br>
to cut a deal with her to only compete once per month,
<br>
because she ALWAYS won.  Course, you could say she had
<br>
an unfair advantage...
<br>
<p>So, anyone know the downside of using low-dosage
<br>
amphetamine for long periods - maybe only every other
<br>
day to stay alert despite fasting?  Would the
<br>
amphetamine itself cause more damage than the eating,
<br>
or the risks associated with being in a mental fog?  I
<br>
used various diet pills for cramming in college in the
<br>
'60's, so I'm certainly not a virgin user...
