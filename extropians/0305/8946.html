</em><br>
<p>### MP's first vote extensively on what they want - they vote on hundreds of
<br>
issues of interest, with the results available for everybody's perusal. The
<br>
votes do not become law, though - until there is a vernier vote. Each MP has
<br>
to decide on the degree of majority needed to pass all of the previously
<br>
voted-on issues. E.g. you voted for a ban on abortion and 51% of MP's did,
<br>
too. But if vernier vote sets the majority at 51%, then you might have to
<br>
accept a ban on prayer in public parks, voted on by, say, 52% of MP's. If
<br>
your minimum majority is too low, you end up with a lot of laws you hate,
<br>
because there will always be some majorities against you. On the other hand,
<br>
if you set your minimum majority too high (99%?), you will end up with laws
<br>
against murder not being passed. Presumably, most humans would choose the
<br>
kind of majority least likely to impose a lot against their wishes, while
<br>
still making sure the really important issues are addressed.
<br>
<p>Vernier voting offers an opportunity to choose the whole set of social
<br>
parameters based on one aggregate vote, taking into consideration
<br>
conflicting wishes, rather than voting on everything piecemeal, and losing
<br>
the sight of the big picture. I am not sure how it would work in practice,
<br>
but I would definitely give it a try. It wouldn't cure the short-sightedness
<br>
inherent in democratic politics, but it should improve the
<br>
conflict-resolution among competing demands.

</em><br>
<p>### Good!
<br>
<p>IQ-weighed, means here that the upper 10% of the MP's chosen by lot from
<br>
among volunteers would form the upper chamber of parliament, allowed to
<br>
write law, or initiate writing a law but not pass it. The remaining 90%, the
<br>
lower chamber, would then pass or reject laws, hopefully using vernier
<br>
voting. So the smart people write law, and the rest of us keeps them honest.
