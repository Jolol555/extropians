The National Council Against Health Fraud
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncahf.org/index.html">http://www.ncahf.org/index.html</a>
<br>
in their latest newsletter,
<br>
<a href="http://www.ncahf.org/digest03/03-18.html">http://www.ncahf.org/digest03/03-18.html</a>
<br>
have just noted:
<br>
----------------------------------
<br>
The state of Florida has started an active campaign to help protect the 
<br>
public from unlicensed nutrition practitioners.
<br>
Billboards are going up around the state saying:
<br>
&quot;Are you losing more than weight? Unlicensed diet and nutrition advice 
<br>
is dangerous. Follow the advice of a licensed dietitian/nutritionist or 
<br>
nutrition counselor.&quot;
<br>
This campaign is financed from licensure fees. The Florida Dietetics and 
<br>
Nutrition Practice Council 
<br>
<a href="http://www9.myflorida.com/mqa/dietetics/nd_home.html">http://www9.myflorida.com/mqa/dietetics/nd_home.html</a> oversees the 
<br>
licensure of about 3,000 dietitian/nutritionists (who have accredited 
<br>
degrees and at least 900 hours of supervised training) and 280 nutrition 
<br>
counselors (less qualified individuals who were grandfathered when the 
<br>
law was passed). As of January 2003, 42 states, Washington DC, and 
<br>
Puerto Rico have some level of licensure or certification for nutrition 
<br>
professionals, but Florida appears to be the first to warn against using 
<br>
unlicensed practitioners.
<br>
-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>Perhaps we should stop discussing diet advice? A lot of the so-called 
<br>
diet advice on the net comes from people or companies with their own 
<br>
business interests at heart. i.e. Buy my book(s), buy my training 
<br>
courses, buy my special supplements, buy my special diet food, buy, buy, 
<br>
buy, buy ......
<br>
<p>For every site advocating lean meat, there is another advocating fatty 
<br>
meat and another advocating no meat at all. Every variation of diet 
<br>
under the sun has a site on the net with some sort of analysis or 
<br>
reports seeming to justify their particular opinion.
<br>
<p>One important point all advocates of particular diet regimes should 
<br>
remember is that everyone's metabolism is different. And people of 
<br>
different ages and lifestyles have different requirements. What works 
<br>
for gts might bring me out in spots or make Mike's hair fall out. 
<br>
Remember the politician that turned blue from the silver supplement he 
<br>
was taking? Or the anorexia nervosa girls dying because they are 
<br>
frightened of all foods?
<br>
<p>Going for self medication is starting down a pretty risky path without 
<br>
doing very detailed analysis of yourself. Blood tests, allergies, 
<br>
cholesterol levels and so on. A professional can do all these tests 
<br>
before discussing his recommendations with you.
<br>
<p>Please tread carefully if you go the DIY route.
<br>
