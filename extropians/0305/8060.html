<em>&gt; &gt; I would bet that the facts would show that the embedded reporter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the more accurate report in the vast majority of cases, while the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-embedded reporter was filing based on second and third hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information, generally Iraqi propaganda or that of sympathizers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Embedded reporters filed live video from the scene while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-embedded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reporters filed from a hotel balcony in Amman or Kuwait or Bagdad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strange, but I have the opposite interpretation.  The embedded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journalists usually were kept out of combat and out of harm's way.
</em><br>
<p>This is inaccurate. Several embedded journalists were engaged in combat
<br>
operations. Specifically, Ollie North engaged in helicopter operations
<br>
in which his chopper was damaged by enemy fire, they landed and
<br>
repaired a fuel line, and took off again. Greg Kelly was wounded in the
<br>
face by glass fragments blasted by enemy fire. Several other embedded
<br>
reporters had similar experiences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They filed live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reports from the aircraft carriers hundreds of miles away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real action.  Whereas those reporters on the balconies of the hotels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were often in the very buildings being bombed.  They seemed to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a better view of the battleground than the embedded reporters most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nonembeds were of two sorts. They were either in bed with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enemy: from non-coalition countries and cooperated with the Baath
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regime, or they were of the old school cocktail set that thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; covering a war meant spending more time around a hotel pool than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anywhere else. Only the embeds, in my opinion, deserve the title
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Journalist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow!  Do you realize how close to endorsing a government-controlled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media this is?  Only those reporters sponsored, approved and fed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information from the military government are real journalists, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while independents, unapproved journalists are automatically suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maybe even enemy sympathizers if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their stories don't match the official government releases.  
</em><br>
<p>An embedded reporter reporting live from the battlefield cannot have
<br>
his story changed, manipulated, or hand fed by military handlers. I do
<br>
not count pool reporters who stayed in Kuwait and relied on handouts
<br>
from Press Officers as 'embedded'. Nor did the embedded reporters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without even arguing the accuracy of this, even the theory of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are proposing seems about as anti-liberty as one can get.  Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when did the free press become the enemy of liberty and pro-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government-controlled-media become the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politically correct position?  Who are you and what have you done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Mike Lorrey?  :-)
</em><br>
<p>I don't necessarily think that you have to be embedded to do accurate
<br>
reporting. What I saw, though, was that those reporters with integrity,
<br>
who wanted to get front lines action, went into the embed program.
<br>
Those who were already hopelessly biased against the US government, who
<br>
were determined to paint a negative picture of US military operations,
<br>
it seems to me, went independent, and those who are nothing but yellow
<br>
bellied elitist chickenshits stayed in their hotel rooms, reported off
<br>
of US OR Iraqi government handouts, and thought a papercut from the
<br>
dining service was deserving of combat pay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The classic example was Greg Kelly of FOX reporting from the front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; steps of Saddam's new palace in Bagdad at the same time that Bagdad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bob, aka Comical Ali, was claiming a few blocks away to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; international reporters that there were no Americans in Bagdad. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nobody today will now claim to have been present at Bagdad Bob's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; news conferences and taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his pronouncements as fact, though many did so at the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but there are similar cases in reverse.  The famous image of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam's statue being pulled down by Iraqi citizens are now known 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have been staged by the military using ex-Iraqis that we shipped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in.
</em><br>
<p>An Iraqi exile is not an 'ex-Iraqi'. Trying to delegitimize someone
<br>
because they were lucky enough to escape Saddam in the past is
<br>
dishonest. That they went back and are trying to rebuild their homeland
<br>
is indicative of whether they are really 'iraqis'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Please, Harvey, document any actual instance where an embedded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reporter was ordered to report facts not in evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will probably object that these examples don't prove the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporters were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;ordered&quot; to lie, but they certainly were fed information which later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned out to be false.
</em><br>
<p>That isn't really what I asked, then, is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Read &quot;The Military's Media&quot; by Robert Jensen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.progressive.org/may03/jen0503.html">http://www.progressive.org/may03/jen0503.html</a>&gt;.  The first paragraph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that reporters were given specific orders on what to say and not say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intheir news broadcasts.  He even quotes one reporter saying &quot;we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been given orders&quot; and changing it to &quot;the soldier have been given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orders&quot; later.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the context. If the reporter or soldiers around him have
<br>
been given orders not to disclose their exact location or where they
<br>
plan to advance to, that isn't false reporting is it? All it is is
<br>
operational security, which you should be fully aware of given your
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The toppling of Saddam's statue was a staged event reported exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the military told the reporters to report it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2842.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article2842.htm</a>&gt;  Wider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pictures show the obviously staged small event in a cordained off 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area.  It is hard to imagine that anybody involved thought this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a real event being reported.  They reporters and camera crews all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helped stage the events, crop, edit the pictures to make it appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a large crowded event, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then presented the desired result as independent, objective news and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a military PR event.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that you are comparing the event to peoples memories of
<br>
things like the Tianenmen Square demonstrations or the Berlin Wall
<br>
coming down. Popular opinion is that these were spontaneous events when
<br>
the facts are that they were highly staged and orchestrated and local
<br>
groups had a lot more opportunties for locals to get organized into
<br>
large masses. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Looting in Bagdad was often encouraged (or at least not discouraged)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by U.S. soldiers and then fed to the reporters as evidence of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populace rising up against Saddam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3311.htm">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3311.htm</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Many US soldiers have said that it's like the people getting their own
<br>
back. The left has reported the looting as if it has been massive and
<br>
widespread, but it turns out that it has been highly focused on
<br>
government facilities and the homes of very wealthy Baathist leaders.
<br>
<p>An example of fake reporting by the left is the whole museum looting
<br>
episode. The left bought the claims of the Baathist director of the
<br>
museum that 170,000 priceless antiquities had been looted without any
<br>
fact checking. It turns out that most all items had been securely
<br>
stored across town as per government plan. The actual number of items
<br>
stolen: 27. Yup, 27. And this isn't counting the many items made of
<br>
precious metals and gems which are now suspected to be fake
<br>
replacements for items looted by Saddam over the last several decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This report lists a number of instances where independent reporters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were intimidated by the U.S. military trying to block their stories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they disputed the official military version.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0401-10.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0401-10.htm</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If I were a soldier who saw a reporter reporting a story I knew to be
<br>
absolute horseshit, I'd be a little intimidating too. Nothing pisses
<br>
off a soldier more than a civilian talking shit about him.
<br>
<p>My personal experience with reporters is that they are liars, and the
<br>
more liberal ones lie the most, and especially when it comes to the
<br>
military, and to other things they dislike, like the Second Amendment,
<br>
but thats another discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The rescue of Jessica Lynch seems to have been highly fictional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/64568.html">http://timesargus.nybor.com/Story/64568.html</a>&gt;.  It describes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embedded reporters as being hand-picked by the military and too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependent on reports fed to them from their military handlers.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also lists a whole bunch of other stories that turned out to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inaccurate.  All of these seem to have been fed to the reporters who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dutifully reported them, and then later turned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to have no basis in fact or no supporting evidence besides the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military press release.  
</em><br>
<p>Military operations are intrinsically foggy. Vision is tunnelled by
<br>
adrenaline, and events happen so fast, while communication is muddled,
<br>
that inaccuracies are an unavoidable hazard. &quot;The Fog of War&quot; is a real
<br>
phenomenon. Being a veteran, and knowing lots of veterans who have
<br>
expressed their opinions of this war, the veterans opinion is that
<br>
people got a far more accurate idea of the progress of the war from the
<br>
embeds than from any other source, and their reporting was far better
<br>
than they'd seen from reporters in previous wars.
<br>
<p>Those reporters who were 'too proud' to be embedded are generally the
<br>
type who disgust veterans to begin with. Even worse are those embedded
<br>
with the enemy, like Peter Arnett.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One particularly obvious story is the article written by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Times reporter Judith Miller, who later admitted that she was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed to see any of the evidence or interview the people.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She just repeated what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military handlers told her to say.  This probably has the longest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list of specific examples.
</em><br>
<p>Judith Miller was not an embedded reporter, she was one of the hotel types.
