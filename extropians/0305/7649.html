<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Harvey Stated:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whole planets will be converted to computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for some giant tasks, but not every planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why not?  At this level of technology, everyone can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be emulated, and so why shouldn't every bit of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within reach be converted to computronium?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I explained in the parts that got cut out, there are diminishing returns.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, sorry for making you repeat that.  Our takes are so different
<br>
that I couldn't (and mostly still cannot) see where you are coming
<br>
from.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We will only convert resources as needed for tasks, and only in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locations needed.  The time delays between our system and another makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weaker computer here more valuable to us than a stronger computer over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.
</em><br>
<p>One possibility is that you are talking much more short-term
<br>
than I am.  This seems accurate up until the point that we
<br>
stop identifying with &quot;here&quot; more than &quot;there&quot;.  I'll say
<br>
more about that in a sec.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our weaker computer can calculate an answer in a shorter period of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time then it takes to beam a message to another solar system and get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer back.  The resources needed to do something locally is a lot less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than building a remote processor and doing something remotely.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I'm talking about *being* there.  I see life as a form of
<br>
computation.  There is no point, (ultimately), to doing a computation
<br>
unless you enjoy being that computation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are also other cost factors.  The molten interior of a planet may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroy computronium.  Cooling costs may make it expensive to convert raw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; magma.  It may be cheaper to just coat the surface of the earth, but leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the interior alone.  Or, there may be too much interference with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biosphere.
</em><br>
<p>This all sounds true over the short term.  But for example, in a 1985
<br>
book &quot;Interstellar Migration and the Human Experience&quot;, David
<br>
Criswell has this knock-out article &quot;Solar System Industrialization:
<br>
Implications for Interstellar Migrations.&quot;  In this article, Criswell
<br>
calmly explores (among other things) the amazing project of &quot;star-
<br>
lifting&quot;, where he calculates that it will take about 300 million
<br>
years to uplift, store, and cool plasma from the sun to the point
<br>
that the sun becomes a white dwarf.  (The ultimate idea here is to
<br>
extend the lifetime of the sun.)
<br>
<p>While it's true that Criswell was referring to ideas that are more
<br>
or less equivalent to nanotech---he writes &quot;A 1982 NASA study and
<br>
a best-selling novel by Arthur C. Clarke have explored exponentiating
<br>
systems in space applications---he is not familiar with many of our
<br>
more recent cutting edge ideas, such as an information &quot;singularity&quot;.
<br>
<p>So suppose that we consider simply a thousand years hence.  What
<br>
will the solar system look like?  I'd wager that the whole thing
<br>
will have been re-engineered up to the limits of what is physically
<br>
possible.  (That is, perhaps Criswell is right, and that you can't
<br>
get material out of the sun until much later than that.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It my be much simpler to spread out among dead asteroids than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to keep a stable computer net running in a changing biosphere.
</em><br>
<p>Biosphere?  I don't think that we'll even *have* a biosphere
<br>
by 2500 AD.  Whatever computations that the biosphere is
<br>
performing that we like---i.e., are not cruel, stupid, wasteful,
<br>
but are on the contrary advanced, beneficial and intelligent---
<br>
no clunky biosphere will be needed to perform them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the same reason why we don't cover the entire surface of the earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evenly,
</em><br>
<p>Give us a little while longer!  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or why we don't consume all biomatter as food evenly, or why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporations are equally spaced across all cities.  Development and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution simply don't work that way.  Some spots will be prime,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others will be marginally acceptable, and others will remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untouched by computronium.
</em><br>
<p>It is true that much of the talk of space colonization is misplaced.
<br>
When people talk about colonizing outer space, I point out that
<br>
they haven't even colonized the bottom of the oceans.  Then I point
<br>
out that they've not even colonized swamps and deserts.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, it's only because the technology has been lacking.
