</em><br>
<p>I offered some reason to be concerned about legumes like soy: they contain
<br>
phytates which bind to minerals and disturb digestion. You dismissed it out
<br>
of hand without asking for any details, stating that it didn't matter to you
<br>
because you take so many supplements. But that really was no answer to the
<br>
problem. Supplements are not meant to be antidotes to foods! :)
<br>
<p>In addition to phytates, legumes also contain lectins. As I wrote to mez in
<br>
another thread, lectins are thought to cause or aggravate auto-immune
<br>
diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Lectins are
<br>
glycoproteins evolved by plants to ward off insect predators. It is known
<br>
that lectins attach themselves to the walls of the gut and increase
<br>
intestinal permeability, allowing partially digested food proteins and
<br>
remnants of resident gut bacteria access to the blood stream. In the words
<br>
of Loren Cordain Ph.D., lectins are &quot;cellular Trojan horses.&quot; Some people
<br>
with intestinal disorders like Crohn's disease have experienced complete
<br>
relief of symptoms after eliminating non-paleolithic lectins from their
<br>
diet.
<br>
<p>See <a href="http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7190/1023">http://bmj.com/cgi/content/full/318/7190/1023</a>. This is an article by an
<br>
allergist who, like Cordain, sees lectins as a possible cause of disease. 
<br>
<p>Lectins are present also in other non-paleolithic foods like dairy and
<br>
yeast, but not present in paleolithic foods.
<br>
<p>Phytoestrogens are another potential problem with soy. These should be
<br>
considered, imo, as medicines. They seem to have some value for example in
<br>
female menopause but their use in men is highly dubious. As you know
<br>
estrogen is a female hormone. Phytoestrogens are mild agonists of the
<br>
estrogen receptor; they bind to estrogen receptors much like natural female
<br>
estrogen. Some researchers believe phytoestrogens contribute to male
<br>
impotence.
<br>
<p>We know for certain that we did not consume phytates, lectins and
<br>
phytoestrogens in any significant quantity during our evolution as a
<br>
species. It follows that we are not genetically adapted to them. People who
<br>
accept the theory of evolution should consider them suspect.
