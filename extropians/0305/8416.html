<p><em> &gt;Recently (in connection with my report on weight loss and fitness)&lt;
</em><br>
<p>Greg looked very healthy and svelte.  What an amazing host - he created a 
<br>
whirlwind of a trip from take off out of Houston to our landing on Cozumel, 
<br>
into the town and to the resort.  We had our own boat and dive master and 
<br>
went on approximately 2 dives a day from the boat, and as many as we wanted 
<br>
from the shore.  My favorite was going through the cave-lets and the night 
<br>
dive where we descended about 50 feet and turned our flashlights off and 
<br>
watched the luminous lights of life in the dark.
<br>
<p>The 100+ foot dive was also great.  It's amazing that the water is still 
<br>
clear at 100 feet.  We saw octopus, barracudas and all sorts of quixotic coral.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I
</em><br>
mentioned that Max and Natasha were joining a group I was taking down to
<br>
Cozumel for a dive trip.  I've put most of the underwater stills from
<br>
that trip up at my website:&lt;

<br>
<p>Wow!
<br>
<p><em> &gt;My favorite of Max is this one:&lt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gregburch.net/scuba/cozumel200305/IMGA0359.JPG">http://www.gregburch.net/scuba/cozumel200305/IMGA0359.JPG</a>
<br>
<p>Max loved that barge wreck!  I think this was his favorite dive.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;... and of Natasha, this one:&lt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gregburch.net/scuba/cozumel200305/IMGA0380.JPG">http://www.gregburch.net/scuba/cozumel200305/IMGA0380.JPG</a>
<br>
<p>This was the last dive and I decided to follow Max's example and not use a 
<br>
wetsuit for this dive. :-)
<br>
<p><em> &gt;For those who were wondering about the fun of scuba, these pics ought to
</em><br>
<em> &gt;be some pretty good evidence of the answer!&lt;
</em><br>
<p>This was the greatest vacation I have ever had!  Cozumel is delicious - the 
<br>
air is like fresh perfume, the sand like white powder, and the water a 
<br>
turquoise liquid haven full of brilliantly colored sea life --- simply 
<br>
amazing.
<br>
