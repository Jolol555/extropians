Mike Lorrey said (quoting Ramez Naam)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 7) Neo was able to stop the robots at
</em><br>
the end because he's touched
<br>
<em>&gt; the source and is somehow still
</em><br>
connected to it.  Exactly how isn't
<br>
<em>&gt; clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe all the humans have wireless
</em><br>
hardware.  Maybe some friendly
<br>
<em>&gt; program like the Oracle had the
</em><br>
wireless hardware implanted in Neo's
<br>
<em>&gt; brain while he was still in the
</em><br>
Matrix.  Maybe Neo is a genetic freak
<br>
<em>&gt; whose brain serves as a transmitter
</em><br>
and receiver.  Don't know.  But
<br>
<em>&gt; everything is consistent with him
</em><br>
using his connection to the
<br>
<em>&gt; software world to force the robots
</em><br>
themselves to self-destruct.
<br>
<p>Notice that he says &quot;Wait, something is
<br>
different.&quot; This is the same
<br>
line he uses in the first movie when
<br>
they are in the building and were
<br>
betrayed by Mr. Reagan to Agent Smith,
<br>
when Neo notices the cat going
<br>
by twice... He notices that reality has
<br>
been looped after the
<br>
Nebuchadnezzar has been bombed and they
<br>
are fleeing the Sentinels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Rather than coming from Neo, Couldn't
<br>
the EMP that destroyed these sentinels
<br>
have come from Naobi's ship that showed
<br>
up to rescue them immediately after the
<br>
destructive EMP like event occurred?
