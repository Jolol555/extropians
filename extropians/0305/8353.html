<p>### Do you have a hypothesis as to what this difference might be? What are

the postulated non-degradable molecular species?

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is a legitimate hypothesis, but I'd need more data before I

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neither (well, not as the main factor anyway).  Centenarians'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arteries have lots of fatty deposits.  The main difference is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their vascular smooth muscle is less prone to get inflamed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyperplastic as a result of the presence of this nasty stuff: i.e.,

effects of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia on the natural history of
<br>
aortic atherosclerosis by the stage of intimal lesions. [Journal Article]
<br>
Atherosclerosis. 128(1):85-95, 1997 Jan 3.
<br>
<p>Apparently even at around age 79 you still find people with no intimal
<br>
lesions. How did they escape their accumulation?
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### I went over Chinnery's articles (Am J Hum Gen, Lancet) and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; didn't find any clear statement that hyperproliferation must precede
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; COX negativity.  Where do you think he says that it does?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, that's part of the problem, his model ineluctably predicts that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but he doesn't properly take it on board.  The driving force that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows mutants to take over is an acceleration of mitochondrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replication when there are too few working mitochondria, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutant mitochondria playing no part -- effectively they are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulating (or fluctuating) detritus.  But when they do accumulate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a result of drift, the total mitochondrial number increases to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensate, keeping the number of wild type mitochondria optimal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This only breaks down when the mitochondrial number reaches &quot;alpha&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times the optimal wild-type.  So we should see hyperproliferation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the cell loses COX activity.
</em><br>
<p>### I don't understand. The mutants take over mainly as a result of
<br>
stochastic processes, with no clear mitochondrial proliferative response to
<br>
partial loss of function. There is a substantial functional reserve of
<br>
mitochondria, and the nucleus seems to maintain a constant mass of genomes
<br>
(at least in some experimental paradigms), so there is no mitochondrial
<br>
hyperproliferation until very late in the process, if at all. Since the
<br>
stochastic hypothesis makes no reference to the cause of hyperproliferation,
<br>
merely predicting the emergence of COX-negativity, it is compatible with
<br>
either hyperproliferation before COX negativity, after, or none at all, if
<br>
the cell simply decides not to upregulate mitos. These two processes are
<br>
most likely largely independent, over large range of heteroplasmy levels.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if indeed the mutated genome has a selective advantage, then cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with more mt genomes would be at a higher risk of suffering a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mutation (this risk goes up as a simple function of the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; genomes), and once a single mutation is present, such cell would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very quickly shift to 100% mutated genomes, as a result of selection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right -- other things being equal.  But they aren't equal (see below).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; very large cells, like the ovum, and the syncytial muscle fiber, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 100 000 mtDNA's, and very small or quiescent cells, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chondrocytes, with only 1000 to 5000 mtDNA's, would differ in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accumulation of mutations by an order of magnitude or more. Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; indeed the case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not really, because the rate of accumulation is also affected by many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things.  The foremost is the mutation rate, which is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very affected by the respiration rate -- so in fact, oocytes shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get much mutant mtDNA because they are so quiescent.  A second is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability for cells to die and be replaced once they become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COX-negative; this almost certainly happens, so it's not easy to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your comparison except across postmitotic, rather apoptotis-resistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells.  Muscle fibres are a bit strange because the mitochondria are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not very mobile, but the COX-negativity does spread slowly along the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fibre.
</em><br>
<p>### In the CNS there are neurons with enormous differences in cellular mass,
<br>
from tiny interneurons to the giant alpha motor neurons. The giant ones do
<br>
have a very active metabolism. If indeed single deleterious mutations had a
<br>
significant replicative advantage, the large neurons would die much faster
<br>
than the interneurons, which is not the case.
<br>
<p>Also, we know that the mutation level in single neurons in elderly adults is
<br>
in the range of 50 to 800 diverse aminoacid-changing mutations per million
<br>
bases (according to Simon and Beal), meaning that more than ninety percent
<br>
of genomes are mutated, and without doubt many of them are deleterious. This
<br>
leaves little place for a preferential amplification of low psi or otherwise
<br>
impaired mitos.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Chinnery was able to get simulation results consistent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experimental observations even without stem mitochondria.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope -- only to the superficial extent that he analysed his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation. He found parameters that gave a realistic number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; COX-negative cells in a lifetime, but he forgot to look at how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells were highly heteroplasmic (had lots of wild-type and lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutant).  There are far more of these than there are COX-negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells -- but in real life, including in (eg) Brierley et al, a paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Turnbull's group that he actually cites to the contrary!, we see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many more totally or virtually homoplasmic mutant cells than highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heteroplasmic ones.  Ah yes, as you note:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Chinnery's model indicates that the number of cells with 50% mutated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; genomes will be actually pretty low, on the order of a few percent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; aged humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few percent is actually a lot higher than the number of 100% mutant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells seen in real life in any tissue except the substantia nigra and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one or two similarly stressed brain regions.  There it's 10%; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeletal or cardiac muscle it's down around 0.1%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>### We see much higher levels of mutated genomes in the elderly cortex, as
<br>
noted above, very compatible with Chinnery's model.
