<br>
<em>&gt; It is a sincere question. Every molecule could be called nano-whatever. Is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to nano-rna for example.
</em><br>
<p>There are plenty of others who could answer this better than me,
<br>
but I'll take a crack and let them inform both of us.
<br>
<p>Carbon-nanotubes do not occur naturally there are structures that
<br>
have been manufactured. Indeed they are amongst the first
<br>
manufactured nanostructures with properties that might hold
<br>
promise as elements in a variety of nanomachines or applications.
<br>
Nanotubes can conduct electricity. They are hollow and might
<br>
potentially be used as containers to deliver very small amounts of dna.
<br>
<p>I attended a Nanoparticles in biology conference early this year in which
<br>
a woman from the CSIRO (Australia) was talking about their early plans
<br>
to use carbon nanotubes as wires between fixed gold points on circuit
<br>
boards (gold can also be drawn very fine) and so make small circuits.
<br>
The interesting thing was that they were considering holding the pieces
<br>
together ie binding the nanotubes to the gold with DNA using
<br>
dna and complementary dna molecules. They were going to have the
<br>
circuits self assemble in solution.
<br>
<p>Sometime, when I get more time, I'll see if I can chase down the sources
<br>
of the above, though they are quite likely not in the journals yet.
<br>
<p>Bottom line though is that nanotubes are *manufactured* and they
<br>
have some particularly *useful* properties that (at least potentially)
<br>
suggest that they will be amongst the first components used in
<br>
anyset of components in nano assembly work.
<br>
<p>This answer is crude and all more knowledge extropes should please
<br>
feel free to refine it.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
