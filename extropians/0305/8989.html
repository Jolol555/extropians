Several people have objected to my reductio of the &quot;averagist&quot; position,
<br>
the altruist whose goal is to maximize the average happiness of members
<br>
of the human race.
<br>
<p>I have to admit that I was wrong to neglect the impact of the killing
<br>
of half of all people on the happiness of the remainder.  So my argument
<br>
does not really work.
<br>
<p>However I still think there is a core of truth to what I said.  Imagine a
<br>
race of people who are, for some reason, not bothered if the averagist
<br>
kills others.  Maybe they think he is God (or maybe he actually is God)
<br>
and so they believe that his actions are for the best.  Or perhaps their
<br>
psychology is simply radically different from ours.
<br>
<p>Among such people, the averagist would now proceed to kill all except one.
<br>
It is exactly the same principle used if you were given a barrel full
<br>
of potatoes, and told that you could remove them such that you should
<br>
maximize the average weight of the potatoes in the barrel.  The answer
<br>
is that you just leave in the heaviest potato.  In the same way, the
<br>
averagist will kill all but the happiest person.
<br>
<p>I don't think most of us would agree that this is a truly altruistic
<br>
action, even among people such as I have described, who are not bothered
<br>
by the killing of others.  Killing all but one of them is incredibly
<br>
harmful and is not altruistic in any meaningful sense of the word.
<br>
<p>Therefore I still claim that averagism is not a legitimate form of
<br>
altruism.
<br>
<p>Hal
