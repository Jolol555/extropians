<p>A kinder, gentler libertarianism? Yes, I have also noted a 
<br>
hardness in many libertarian discussions. But much of this is 
<br>
just political culture and possible (with hard work) to grow 
<br>
away from. A friend has a lovely saying &quot;I'm a libertarian and 
<br>
capitalist, so I throw money at things and people I like!&quot; - 
<br>
which really shows that libertarianism can be about friendship 
<br>
and generosity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Inasmuch, it seems to me that a future oriented political

</em><br>
<em>&gt; dramatic a belief about how things ought to be.  It isn't

</em><br>
<p>I think one need both the staunchness to stand for what one
<br>
really believes in, and the flexibility to bring about positive
<br>
change. Much of current politics is just flexibility with no 
<br>
ideological core, and hence becomes mindless pragmatism 
<br>
supporting the status quo and re-election. Standing around 
<br>
demanding ideological purity will never lead anywhere and does 
<br>
tend to produce the rigid kind of thinking that repels people 
<br>
who agree with the ideas in general. But keeping a balance in 
<br>
between is hard.
<br>
<p>Fuller's catalytic schemas are elegant, but often fragile like
<br>
his tensegrities: all parts need to come together to make them
<br>
work. When they do, it is a wonder to behold. When they don't,
<br>
it is just a mess of wires and sticks. I like the idea of
<br>
creating seed organisations and technologies that can grow and
<br>
become alternatives to the current situation. The best kind of
<br>
catalysis is catalysing creative growth. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd like to know of someone who is thinking more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futuristically when discussing political models.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. I'll shout when I find them. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Sure.  Today, I plan on working on a mock up.  I'll send it as 
</em><br>
soon 
<br>
<em>&gt; as I have it written down.
</em><br>
<p>Great!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; BTY, I had planned to email you privately today, but discussing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this openly is fine.  I look forward to a collaborative exchange.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max is in the wing as well and I welcome anyone else who wants to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help me out with this.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good. I think this kind of project can benefit from broad 
<br>
ideas, although in the end they need to be funneled into a 
<br>
single document and chart.
