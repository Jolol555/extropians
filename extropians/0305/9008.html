<em>&gt; ### But choosing 16 women and 7 men (is there some Gnostic hint in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers?) from the Matrix to leave and build a new Zion is compatible with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical existence of Zion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It's also compatible with the model of recursion.
<br>
<p>I find that the model of reality in the Matrix as a recursive procedure
<br>
works well.  The base case of the recursion comes in the iteration of the
<br>
Matrix in which the members of Zion and the humans remaining in the matrix
<br>
stay in equilibrium.  At the point at which it becomes clear whether
<br>
the system is stable or unstable, The One is chosen (or arises), and the
<br>
decision of The One is indicative of whether or not the system is stable
<br>
in this instance.  When the system's configuration reaches stability,
<br>
the recursion will return to the top of the stack, and the proper model
<br>
for the Matrix will have been realized.  Otherwise, the One chooses his
<br>
playmates, and instantiations of them are passed into the next recursion.
<br>
<p>The COOL thing, if you accept this model, is that you don't even KNOW
<br>
after Neo makes his decision WHICH decision he made.  Perhaps he has been
<br>
returned to Zion to CHOOSE his companions, after which Zion will fall,
<br>
the Matrix will recurse, and it will all start over.  Since the system
<br>
is outside of Neo's control, HE needn't actually remember (correctly,
<br>
at least) which decision he made.  But, then, this is reaching a bit.
<br>
<p>Entities like the Architect and the Oracle are procedures that are either
<br>
exist statically within the procedure (there is only a unique instance of
<br>
them, no matter what level of the recursion you're at), and thus they're
<br>
aware of the recursive nature of their reality.  They also know a great
<br>
deal about the future WITHOUT knowing what choice the One will make.
<br>
But for entities that exist only in one level, there's no way to tell
<br>
how many recursions removed from reality they are.  THIS could be the
<br>
&quot;real&quot; matrix, or the stack above you could be indefinitely deep.
<br>
<p>This fits nicely with Neo's ability to destroy the Machines at the end
<br>
of the second movie, since the &quot;reality&quot; of Zion is just the other half
<br>
of the recursive reality.  The previous Ones had, apparently, just not
<br>
realized this ability.
<br>
<p>And Agent Smith has figured out how to overrun a buffer in a remote
<br>
procedure and cause it to exec() his own code.  ;-)  It all works rather
<br>
tidily, and I haven't heard anyone else offer this explanation.
<br>
<p>I've found nothing so far that doesn't fit well in this model, but I
<br>
think it's probably somewhat rarified for a general audience.  Maybe I
<br>
just do too many drugs and too much functional programming.
