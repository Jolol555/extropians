<p><em>   &gt; &gt; This is an extremely interesting point.  I don't really grok

</em><br>
<p>So, no, I don't think that terms like &quot;idiot&quot; should be expunged
<br>
from the English language, and I gave my reasons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To `let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off steam', perhaps; that is, the verbal outburst substitutes for a punch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the mouth, costly behavior liable to get out of control. But for social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals like us, it looks to me primarily like a control mechanism. Nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to be despised, especially as an *idiot* (a term of abuse and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disparagement that children bandy about to great effect). If I call you a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuckwit, it's not to inform you of my provisional scientific opinion; it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give you pause, to wound you, to make you modify your behavior so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in future you'll be less like to act that way.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I agree instead with Gordon and others who suggest
<br>
that in face to face (or post to post) arguments, it's almost
<br>
NEVER a good idea to call someone a name.  In particular, IMO
<br>
you shouldn't *ever* call anyone a fuckwit directly.  I don't
<br>
buy your idea of &quot;giving them pause&quot;.  You'll rarely succeed
<br>
in doing more than increasing hostility.
<br>
<p>But the term does nonetheless have value for the reasons I gave,
<br>
e.g., to offer a challenge to your listener's evaluations, to
<br>
connote your own emotional calculations.  So if I were to say
<br>
that Jeremy Rifkin is a screwball, then I'm (1) challenging you
<br>
to reorder your semantic links so that maybe you approve of
<br>
him less, and (2) telling you unambiguously what I think of
<br>
him.  But it would be counterproductive (not to say rude) to
<br>
make such a statement were he reading this list.
