<p><em>&gt; Thus those who refused to fit into the  pacifist/militarist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dichotomy left the discussion [of war related themes].  (So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did most of the pacifists, as being out shouted isn't a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasant experience
</em><br>
<p>I'm having a hard time relating to what you are trying to
<br>
convey here.  Of course, one cannot be literally out-shouted,
<br>
(the way that a speaker can at Berkeley).  So let me try to
<br>
guess (just to save time).
<br>
<p>I do notice that if I believe X and suddenly there are a
<br>
large number of posts claiming ~X, and the claims merely
<br>
repeat old arguments I've heard before, or betray a
<br>
revealing mindset (e.g. luddism), then it's uncomfortable
<br>
knowing which, if any, to respond to.
<br>
<p>So what could be the reasons for this discomfort.  I can
<br>
think of, given that I wish to spend only so much time and
<br>
effort writing posts
<br>
<p>(a) failure to address all the points made may leave the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impression that I agree with those points
<br>
(b) those posts I single out may be written by people who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subsequently demand *particular* replies to them for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions they have or further points they make
<br>
<p>But beyond these two, I have been unable to come up with
<br>
anything.  Why else would one feel &quot;shouted down&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...and if you don't really enjoy shouting back, it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth the effort... nobody is listening to what you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, in the first place, I seldom characterize my *own*
<br>
posts as &quot;shouting&quot;, but to each his own  ;-)
<br>
<p>In the second place, presumably others who feel just as I
<br>
do appreciate even more my speaking up.  So this simply is
<br>
not logical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And it turned into a bunch of militarists arguing over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details of why the whole thing was right and  proper.
</em><br>
<p>Up to this point, your remarks addressed a phenomenon.
<br>
But now perhaps even this new thread will probably revert
<br>
to exactly the kind of discussion that you feel you are
<br>
being shouted down in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nobody had changed their opinion, but the loudest voices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had clearly dominated the thread, and that proved that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their views were correct.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, you are being ironic here, but still, for some
<br>
reason I, although impressed by uniformity, nonetheless
<br>
often stubbornly persist in my own views anyway.  When this
<br>
happens, of course, one has to re-examine one's views to 
<br>
wonder just why one has an &quot;unusual&quot; view, but often
<br>
convincing explanations surface.
<br>
