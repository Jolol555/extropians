<p><em>&gt; So to sum up, there is not that much wrong with the paleo diet. 
</em><br>
<p>Glad you agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just that it ignores perfectly good food groups
</em><br>
<p>What food groups do you have in mind? Agricultural and dairy products? How
<br>
are these food 
<br>
groups &quot;perfectly good&quot; replacements for other paleolithic food groups,
<br>
other than as a cheap source of calories useful for avoiding famine? Keep in
<br>
mind that one cannot add a calorie from one source without also subtracting
<br>
a calorie from another source.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and forgets to insist that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regular exercise is also required for good health.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe anyone here is forgetting exercise. These threads have been
<br>
about diet, mainly.
<br>
<p>As for paleo exercise, we're probably best suited to brief bursts of energy,
<br>
as from running from predators, attacking prey that we've been tracking, and
<br>
carrying prey and other heavy items back to camp. This suggests moderns are
<br>
best off doing wind-sprints and relatively short intense weight-lifting
<br>
sessions as opposed to very long distance running or cycling
<br>
(notwithstanding certain modern aborigine tribesman who sometimes run
<br>
forever).
<br>
<p>Recently on another health-related discussion list I posted a case study
<br>
about a male marathon runner who suffered from severely diminished
<br>
testosterone levels after running approximately 15 miles per day for
<br>
something like a dozen years. His hypothalamic/pituitary/testicular (HPT)
<br>
axis was shot from the constant impact stress to his pelvis. He quite
<br>
literally almost ran his balls off. :/ Fortunately for Forrest Gump his
<br>
doctor was able to restore normal testicular function by administering the
<br>
female fertility drug clomiphene citrate (Clomid) daily for six months.
<br>
Clomid is a drug used often by professional body-builders to offset some of
<br>
the negative consequences of anabolic steroid use. But that's a completely
<br>
different discussion.
