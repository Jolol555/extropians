Major spoilers below.  I analyze the movie in detail.  I make
<br>
predictions about the next movie.  Read at your own peril.

<br>
<p>Okay, I saw this a second time.  Here's what I think is going on.
<br>
<p>First of all, I reject the idea of a matrix within the matrix.  Zion
<br>
is in base reality.  I believe this for reasons Brian Atkins has
<br>
already posted and also for the following meta-reasons:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a plot resolution would not be satisfying to most of the
<br>
Matrix's audience.
<br>
<p><p>I believe the real them of Reloaded and of the resolution of the story
<br>
in Revolutions is symbiosis between man and machine.  At the end of
<br>
Revolutions the humans and some machines will both be alive and on
<br>
their way to co-existing in some positive-sum way.
<br>
<p>There are a couple important conversations in Reloaded about
<br>
symbiosis:
<br>
<p>1) The Oracle says &quot;I care about the future.  And the only way to get
<br>
there is *together*.&quot;
<br>
<p>2) The councilor talks to Neo about the codependence of the humans in
<br>
Zion and their machines.
<br>
<p>Okay, that's the resolution the plot is heading for.  Now, here are
<br>
some details of what I think is going on with Neo, the past Ones, the
<br>
Architect, etc..
<br>
<p>1) Neo is indeed the 6th entity called &quot;the One&quot; in the Matrix, though
<br>
he is also different from the past entities.  Evidence:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1a) Smith says &quot;it's happening just as before&quot; when he sees Neo
<br>
kick the butts of the three agents at the beginning.  Then Smith #2
<br>
shows up and says &quot;well, not quite&quot;.  This indicates to me that Smith
<br>
has been around in past versions of the Matrix.  But in past versions
<br>
of the Matrix, Smith has never broken free and gained the ability to
<br>
duplicate himself.  This is also consistent with Smith telling Neo
<br>
&quot;you did something I thought wasn't possible, you destroyed me&quot;.  That
<br>
had never happened to Smith in his battles with previous Ones.  They'd
<br>
beaten him, but never as deeply.  Smith has now gone rogue in the
<br>
Matrix.  He says &quot;I knew the rules, I knew what I was supposed to do,
<br>
but I didn't.  I stayed.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1b) The Merovingian tells Neo &quot;I survived your predecessors&quot;,
<br>
which indicates past One's.  But he also says &quot;your predecessors had
<br>
more respect&quot;, which indicates a difference between Neo and previous
<br>
Ones.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1c) The Architect of course tells Neo that there have been
<br>
previous Ones, but he also at one points says &quot;interesting.  you
<br>
figured that out faster than the others&quot; which indicates again that
<br>
Neo is different.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1d) Also, if the Architect gave past Ones a choice similar to
<br>
Neo's, and we believe what the Architect is saying, the past Ones
<br>
*must* have chosen to return to the source, pick a few people from
<br>
Zion, and re-create it. Otherwise humanity would now be extinct.  But
<br>
Neo chose differently, again pointing out a difference between him and
<br>
past Ones.
<br>
<p>2) Neo has his powers in the Matrix because the compromise in this
<br>
version of the Matrix is that humans must be able to at least
<br>
subconsciously choose whether or not to accept the Matrix.  Neo is one
<br>
of the very rare individuals who can partially accept it and partially
<br>
reject it, allowing him to bend its rules of physics.  The existence
<br>
of such individuals is an unfortunate but inevitable side effect of
<br>
giving people a subconscious choice.  And giving people a subconscious
<br>
choice is, as the Architect tells us, the only technique found so far
<br>
that gets such a large number of humans to accept the Matrix.  
<br>
<p>This is basically straight out of the Architect's speech, but makes
<br>
more sense in the second viewing.
<br>
<p>3) The Architect believes that the warping effect on the Matrix of
<br>
either Neo ignoring so many physical laws or perhaps side effects of
<br>
that will result in the complete violation of the Matrix's rules and a
<br>
crash of the entire simulation.  That is why the Architect tells Neo
<br>
that if he goes back into the Matrix without first going to the Source
<br>
and having his code disseminated, he will cause a crash in the system
<br>
that will kill everyone human plugged into the Matrix.  This is again
<br>
straight out of the Architect's speech, but makes more sense in the
<br>
context of why Neo has his powers (see #2, above).
<br>
<p>4) The Architect will be found to be wrong.  Neo is more special than
<br>
the previous Ones, and either his greater power or greater control of
<br>
his powers or something else special about him will allow him to avoid
<br>
that total crash.  Instead he will liberate the humans plugged into
<br>
the Matrix without causing all their deaths.  
<br>
<p>5) It seems plausible to me that Persephone really is the &quot;intuitive
<br>
program created to investigate human emotions&quot; that the Architect
<br>
talks about.  The Oracle is definitely not it based on his reaction.
<br>
I think the whole &quot;Mother of the Matrix&quot; thing is a bit over hyped.
<br>
The intuitive program just basically made the realization that if
<br>
humans plugged into the Matrix had a subconscious choice about
<br>
participation, more of them would accept the illusion.  The Architect
<br>
is still the one who built the Matrix and put that attribute into the
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>6) Smith is very simple.  He is a program that has served as an Agent
<br>
for several versions now.  In that role he (and the other agents) had
<br>
limited access to information.  They were not omnipotent over the
<br>
Matrix as a whole, clearly.  In any case, once some of Neo's code
<br>
imprinted on him, Smith has gained the ability to replicate.  He hopes
<br>
to use that ability to completely take over the Matrix, and then
<br>
eventually use that to take over the AIs computing power as well.  His
<br>
replication ability is something that has not been seen in any
<br>
previous version of the Matrix, and so he represents another wildcard
<br>
that the Architect has not previously dealt with.
<br>
<p>7) Neo was able to stop the robots at the end because he's touched the
<br>
source and is somehow still connected to it.  Exactly how isn't clear.
<br>
Maybe all the humans have wireless hardware.  Maybe some friendly
<br>
program like the Oracle had the wireless hardware implanted in Neo's
<br>
brain while he was still in the Matrix.  Maybe Neo is a genetic freak
<br>
whose brain serves as a transmitter and receiver.  Don't know.  But
<br>
everything is consistent with him using his connection to the software
<br>
world to force the robots themselves to self-destruct.  
<br>
<p>So, in sum, next movie it will be revealed that both Neo and Smith are
<br>
unique phenomena not seen in past versions of the Matrix.  Neo will
<br>
defeat Smith (possibly incorporating some of his code) and will go on
<br>
to liberate the humans plugged into the Matrix, avoid a complete crash
<br>
of the Matrix, and catalyze a positive symbiosis between the humans
<br>
and some computers (perhaps by going into the Source and kicking ass).
<br>
<p>cheers,
