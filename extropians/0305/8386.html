<p><em>&gt; I just replied to your post because it was the latest one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that used the terms Left and Right as if they were some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reified Thing.
</em><br>
<p>Just out of curiosity, do you consider Hot and Cold to be
<br>
reified Things?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm absolutely not against political discussion: like I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said, I think it can be relevant to us, but getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotionally involved with your &quot;side&quot;, be that &quot;Left&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Right&quot; is almost a guarantee that no opinions will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed, no resolutions will be made, and polarisation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will render the discussion quite meaningless to onlookers.
</em><br>
<p>Entrenchment, as you know, happens without labels too.
<br>
When at work, for example, a certain proposal appeals
<br>
to some people and not others, it seems to me that 
<br>
almost exactly the same thing transpires.  Probably it's
<br>
only when the same teams keep cropping up against each
<br>
other that they acquire labels, but it would be interesting
<br>
to know if the labels really do make things worse.  So far,
<br>
I've not seen much indication that they do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cooperation clearly evolved at some point, memetically or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically, but the animal instinct to split the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into two simple groups still prevails occasionally. Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even most of the time. [Yes!]  I consider &quot;Me vs. Him&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Us vs. Them&quot;, &quot;This tribe vs. That tribe&quot;, &quot;This nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vs. That nation&quot;, &quot;This ideology vs. That ideology&quot; to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifestations of the same thing.
</em><br>
<p>And when it's naturally absent, there often appears to be a
<br>
real need for it, e.g., the intense rivalry between high
<br>
schools, or even siblings, and the parties appear even to
<br>
take steps to create it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whatever the cause is, I believe it is a quirk of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection that should, at least in principle, yield to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superrationality.
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone believe in &quot;superrationality&quot; in game theory 
<br>
anymore?  I can't tell from a quick reading of
<br>
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/<a href="mailto:agi@v2.listbox.com?Subject=Re:%20Status%20of%20Superrationality%20(was%20Left/Right...%20can't%20we%20do%20better%20than%20this?)">agi@v2.listbox.com</a>/msg01025.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/<a href="mailto:agi@v2.listbox.com?Subject=Re:%20Status%20of%20Superrationality%20(was%20Left/Right...%20can't%20we%20do%20better%20than%20this?)">agi@v2.listbox.com</a>/msg01025.html</a>
<br>
where our friends appear to be debating it, although Wei Dai
<br>
reflects what I read in game theory papers these days:
<br>
Hofstadter was wrong about superrationality.  Once, in 1985
<br>
or so, I wrote him about it, and we exchanged a few letters
<br>
(he was always incredibly good that way).  What I would like
<br>
to do now---though I won't because it would be &quot;rubbing it
<br>
in&quot;---would be to write him and ask whether he would Cooperate
<br>
or Defect against the 1983 version of himself if he could go
<br>
back in a time machine.  *OBVIOUSLY* Doug 2003 should Defect,
<br>
since he knows that the 1983 version is going to cooperate.
