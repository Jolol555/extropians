<em>&gt;&gt;That's why I specifically asked for comments on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that particular page instead of your opinion on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the other pages (which I note are written by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;many other authors).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a waste of my time to refute every crackpot webpage that gets posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for review.  When a site obviously is full of misinformation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pseudoscience, it is inefficient to go through and &quot;prove&quot; each item is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.  More than inefficient, it is dangerous.  If I fail to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something wrong, I end up believing some of the pseudoscience.
</em><br>
<p>I'm still a bit unclear on your take. Obviously we both believe that 
<br>
some of the articles on that site are bogus. However, as far as I can 
<br>
tell, the author of the specific article I wanted an opinion on didn't 
<br>
write any of those. In fact she appears to have fairly strong non-kooky 
<br>
credentials from my layman perspective (PhD in Nutrition Science, lab 
<br>
chemistry experience, published over a dozen papers, etc.). And again 
<br>
from my layman position the article itself looks like it makes some 
<br>
interesting points. If it indeed is incorrect information you should be 
<br>
able to easily shoot it down, and I don't buy the inefficient argument 
<br>
since it is not like I am sitting here bringing you every single 
<br>
crackpot post I can find on the Net. You asked about this, and I picked 
<br>
one single page after looking at many many pages, and asked for comments 
<br>
only on that single page.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Please only respond further to this sub-thread if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you are willing to actually discuss the page in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;question and its references.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who deanimated and made you boss?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why should I stand by quietly while people get duped into going to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pseudoscience website?  Why shouldn't I point out that this site is full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misinformation and people should be careful before they start trusting this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site as a source of nutritional advice?  Nutrition is dangerous enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without people taking their information from sites like these.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I brought up the page for discussion after you specifically asked to 
<br>
know if there was anyone out there advising that eating saturated fats 
<br>
is useful. I intend to do my part to keep at least this small part of 
<br>
the list on topic. Therefore I commented that your initial response to 
<br>
my request for comments on that particular page was not very useful. 
<br>
Rather than making any attempt to discuss the page, you attacked the 
<br>
hosting provider of the article. If you want to start a discussion on 
<br>
the usefulness of ever discussing any article that happens to be posted 
<br>
to a site also containing some bogus material then we can do that on 
<br>
another thread. I prefer to keep this particular little one focused on 
<br>
saturated fats and related items of interest.
<br>
<p>P.S. Here is a relevant book: &quot;The Cholesterol Myths...&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0967089700/">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0967089700/</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't ordered it, but it might be worth reviewing.
