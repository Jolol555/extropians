<p>GM foods 'not harmful'
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
By Ivan Noble 
<br>
BBC News Online science staff 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p>Britain's academy of science, the Royal Society, says there is no evidence 
<br>
that eating GM food is any more harmful than eating non-GM food. 
<br>
<p>The UK Government is sponsoring a review of GM science
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
The society says in a submission to the UK Government's GM review that 
<br>
although the technology could lead to &quot;unpredicted harmful changes in the 
<br>
nutritional status of foods&quot;, the same is true of conventional crop breeding. 
<br>
<p><p>It says the chances of GM crops and foods triggering allergic reactions are 
<br>
in principle no worse than the chances of non-GM plants doing the same. 
<br>
<p>A senior member of the Royal Society attacked one environmental protest group 
<br>
for what he said was a failure to provide evidence to back up the assertion 
<br>
that GM food was dangerous. 
<br>
<p>'Smokescreen of claims' 
<br>
<p>&quot;The public have a right to decide whether they want to buy GM foods, and are 
<br>
entitled to have access to sensible and informed advice, based on sound 
<br>
science. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It is disappointing to find a group like Greenpeace stating on its website 
<br>
that 'the risks are enormous and the consequences potentially catastrophic', 
<br>
without offering any solid reasons to support such a claim,&quot; said Professor 
<br>
Patrick Bateson, the Royal Society's Vice-President and Biological Secretary. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Undoubtedly some important questions need to be answered about the potential 
<br>
impact, good or bad, of GM crops on the environment. 
<br>
<p>&quot;But these should be addressed without a smokescreen of unfounded claims 
<br>
about their threat to human health,&quot; he said. 
<br>
<p>Professor Bateson acknowledged that the majority of the British public was 
<br>
opposed to GM foods. 
<br>
<p>Consumers had been frightened by unsubstantiated claims but GM developers had 
<br>
also failed to convince them that GM foods products had benefits, he said. 
<br>
<p>'Pet technologies' 
<br>
<p>A spokesman for Greenpeace UK rejected the attack and criticised the Royal 
<br>
Society's role in the GM debate. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Greenpeace commissioned and published a major report from the University of 
<br>
Wageningen on the uncertainties and unknowns around GM crops. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This has been submitted to the science review and it's a pity Professor 
<br>
Bateson hasn't read it. 
<br>
<p>&quot;But then the Royal Society are gaining a reputation as campaigners for their 
<br>
pet technologies,&quot; he said
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
