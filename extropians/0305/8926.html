<br>
they were
<br>
either
<br>
- still in the matrix (a different part, or different sim maybe; the effort
<br>
to stop the robots seemed very taxing, and something happened to him in
<br>
conjunction with that)
<br>
or
<br>
- the &quot;outside world&quot; including Zion, the ships, the sentinels, etc, is
<br>
another nested level of simulation, and he's just noticed.
<br>
<p>It seems implausible that his ability to stop the robots was anything other
<br>
than a consequence of that environment actually being software. It is quite
<br>
possible that the &quot;real world&quot; has always been another simulation.

<p><em>&gt; Mike Lorrey said (quoting Ramez Naam)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 7) Neo was able to stop the robots at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end because he's touched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the source and is somehow still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected to it.  Exactly how isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Maybe all the humans have wireless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware.  Maybe some friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; program like the Oracle had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wireless hardware implanted in Neo's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain while he was still in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matrix.  Maybe Neo is a genetic freak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whose brain serves as a transmitter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and receiver.  Don't know.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything is consistent with him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using his connection to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; software world to force the robots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves to self-destruct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notice that he says &quot;Wait, something is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different.&quot; This is the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line he uses in the first movie when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are in the building and were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; betrayed by Mr. Reagan to Agent Smith,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when Neo notices the cat going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by twice... He notices that reality has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been looped after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nebuchadnezzar has been bombed and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fleeing the Sentinels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rather than coming from Neo, Couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the EMP that destroyed these sentinels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have come from Naobi's ship that showed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up to rescue them immediately after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive EMP like event occurred?
