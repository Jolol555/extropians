Harvey questioned:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Do you have any specific reasons to questions this?  I thought it was well
<br>
known that while total entropy increases, localized decreases can occur.  It
<br>
makes perfect sense to me that the increases might travel outside our sphere
<br>
of experience so that we can't detect them anymore.  Our whole extropian
<br>
experience that things are getting better is a local phenomenon, not
<br>
violating the second law of thermodynamics.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The authors of the paper indicate that there seems to be a model for the 
<br>
violation of thermodynamic law, but couched their observation by stating that 
<br>
eventually, this violation will be seen to correct itself. I believe that 
<br>
wanted to say what they wanted to say, but were reluctant to stick their 
<br>
collective necks, out. Entropy, as one of the constants of the cosmos may 
<br>
indeed prove to be &quot;adjustable&quot; in the same sense as physicist Joao Magueijo, 
<br>
contends in his hypothesis. This all remains to be seen. If our species, some 
<br>
species, a descendant species of humankind finds a means to make things 
<br>
better globally, after examing the risk, do not be surprised if such a chore 
<br>
is pursued.
