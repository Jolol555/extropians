<p>Cold virus outsmarts, destroys brain tumors
<br>
Genetically engineered cells target only cancers
<br>
M.D. Anderson plans clinical trials for next year

. Graphic: Virus kills brain tumors
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Local scientists have turned a cold virus into a kind of &quot;smart bomb&quot;
<br>
that may be able to destroy the deadliest form of brain cancer. 
<br>
<p>In experiments with mice, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
<br>
Center researchers are reporting that a genetically engineered version
<br>
of the common cold infected and killed malignant glioma cells that
<br>
resist other therapy. The virus doesn't harm normal tissue. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Viral therapy like this may be just what we need to treat a complex
<br>
disease like cancer,&quot; said Dr. Frederick Lang, a professor of
<br>
neurosurgery and primary investigator of the study. &quot;Cancer can be
<br>
devious the way it does everything possible to avoid destruction, but
<br>
viruses are equally tricky and may be able to outsmart brain tumors.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In today's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, M.D.
<br>
Anderson researchers said the therapy produced a response on glioma not
<br>
previously seen with any other treatment. Clinical trials with people
<br>
are expected to begin late next year. 
<br>
<p>Roughly 17,000 new cases of brain tumors are diagnosed in the United
<br>
States every year and half are gliomas, a primary type which arises from
<br>
the brain itself rather than metastasizing from another location.
<br>
Surgery, radiation therapy, steroids and chemotherapy can prolong
<br>
survival, but most everyone dies within a year. 
<br>
<p>The virus is designed in such a way that to reproduce itself, it can
<br>
only replicate in cancer cells, not healthy tissue. While reproducing,
<br>
it kills cancer cells, and when no more are left to infect, the virus
<br>
simply dies. 
<br>
<p>The idea of using viruses to kill cancer cells has been around since the
<br>
1950s, but it is only in recent years that it is moving toward
<br>
application. Therapeutic viruses for lung cancer and head and neck
<br>
cancer are in clinical trials, said Howard Fine, director of the brain
<br>
tumor program at the National Cancer Institute. 
<br>
<p>The NCI is providing $1 million to produce the drug-grade version of the
<br>
therapy in its laboratories. It is scheduled to be finished in time to
<br>
start enrolling patients in a study in the winter of 2004. 
<br>
<p>But Fine warned against expecting too much from the therapy. He called
<br>
it &quot;a promising approach that is one of many good ideas out there,&quot; but
<br>
said success in animal models is a long way from success in human
<br>
patients. He said it is unclear whether the virus will replicate as well
<br>
in humans, where glioma cells are surrounded by normal cells; in mice,
<br>
glioma cells cluster together. 
<br>
<p>But the results in the mice were extraordinary. The virus cured 60
<br>
percent of the glioma tumors implanted in mice brains whereas mice given
<br>
a placebo died after less than three weeks. (A precursor of the virus
<br>
cured 15 percent of the tumors.) 
<br>
<p>The mice that survived treatment with the experimental virus were killed
<br>
for examination. Researchers found only empty cavities and scar tissue
<br>
where the tumors once were. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This therapy needs more study, but it has a lot of potential,&quot; said Dr.
<br>
Juan Fueyo, a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of neuro-oncology,
<br>
the study's lead author and the developer of the genetically engineered
<br>
adenovirus. &quot;We've never had this kind of result with any kind of
<br>
treatment on glioma -- in humans or animals.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The virus is injected directly into the brain tumor surgically, through
<br>
a small hole. Lang expressed hope the therapy might work even better in
<br>
humans because delivery would be more precise. 
<br>
<p>Researchers are studying human adenoviruses for a wide range of medical
<br>
uses, from cancer therapy to gene therapy, because they are so good at
<br>
infecting human cells. One question is how the immune system will
<br>
respond -- will it overreact and cause illness or kill the virus, or
<br>
will it be boosted to kill the cancer or other pathogen. 
<br>
<p>But Lang said he's optimistic the treatment will accomplish its goal
<br>
before the immune system goes after it. 
<br>
<p>The research team also included scientists from the University of
<br>
Alabama at Birmingham and the Institut Catala d'Oncologia in Barcelona,
<br>
Spain.
