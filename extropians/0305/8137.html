<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20More%20enthusiasm%20than%20news%20in%20Fox's%20coverage%20of%20war">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a> writes: Well, we know how to fix that, don't we?  How about 
<br>
a &quot;Fairness Doctrine&quot; which would require stations to carry as much 
<br>
left-biased reporting as right-biased (but, of course, not necessarily the 
<br>
converse).
<br>
<p>I wouldn't go for that.  I have seen PBS apply that doctrine too long.  
<br>
Anyone that is politically active knows the particular individuals that run 
<br>
under one banner and vote with the other party.  Too often I see those folks 
<br>
show up representing the party they run with but talking against that same 
<br>
party in discussion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I wouldn't trust anyone but the free market of ideas to 
<br>
determine the broadcasters and newsmen.  In my opinion we once were very 
<br>
liberal, now we have a lot of people that would rather listen to the 
<br>
conservatives.  But as nearly as I can forecast we will continue swinging 
<br>
small &quot;L&quot; libertarian and will not be conservative at all or at least for 
<br>
very long.
