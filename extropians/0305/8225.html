<p>&quot;Furthermore, the precedent set by the gay community
<br>
in opposing HIV 
<br>
containment remedies in favor of individual rights has
<br>
caused a massive 
<br>
resurgence in other communicable diseases like TB,
<br>
Syphillis, 
<br>
Gonorrhea, etc and hampered the ability of health care
<br>
workers to nip 
<br>
epidemics in the bud. The ability of the US health
<br>
care system to deal 
<br>
with bioterror attacks is similarly compromised as a
<br>
result. &quot;
<br>
<p>Thank you, Mike!  I recall figuring this out on my own
<br>
in the very early days of AIDS, and wondering if
<br>
anyone was ever going to be brave enough in the face
<br>
of the hysterically politically correct gay advocacy
<br>
lobbies to speak the truth.  Finally, in the early
<br>
'90's, I heard this local (Los Angeles) research
<br>
doctor who headed the largest local operation directed
<br>
at AIDS on one of the talk radio shows and I called in
<br>
and posed the question, prefacing it by mentioning
<br>
that I had read McNeil's &quot;Plagues and Peoples.&quot;  
<br>
<p>There was a very  noticeable pause before the doctor
<br>
answered, and you could hear in his voice that he knew
<br>
he was going to catch hell for saying it, but he did,
<br>
and he stated that in fact specifically the rise in
<br>
drug resistant TB was known for certain to be a direct
<br>
result of the AIDS epidemic.  When people can't ever
<br>
quite shake an infection, because their immune systems
<br>
are shot, and have to keep dosing it with antibiotics,
<br>
over and over, then we all know exactly what the
<br>
inevitable result is going to be - SUPER GERMS!
<br>
<p>Of course, the gay community didn't invent
<br>
irresponsible behavior.  The &quot;hippies&quot; (speaking very
<br>
loosely of all those who threw off conventions and
<br>
engaged in a lot of drugs and promiscuous sex in the
<br>
'60's and '70's) had already taken us well down that
<br>
path.  Today, the traditional Hispanic community is
<br>
stupidly following suit.  There is an epidemic among
<br>
married Hispanic women of AIDS and all manner of STDs,
<br>
due to their husbands proving how Macho they are by
<br>
having unprotected sex with prostitutes, including the
<br>
male transvestite prostitutes who are popular in the
<br>
low-life Hispanic bars.  They actually consider it to
<br>
be MORE manly to have sex with a man - so long as they
<br>
take the &quot;male&quot; role, anyway.
