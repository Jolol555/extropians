<p>Mike, we may be using very different definitions of &quot;sustainable&quot;.
<br>
When I speak of &quot;sustainable&quot; I am generally using a definition
<br>
of what is useful over my &quot;anticipated&quot; lifespan.  I.e. 2000-7000
<br>
years if robust MNT arrives in the next 30 years or roughly
<br>
the same time scale if robust MNT does not arrive in the next 30
<br>
years, but cryonic reanimation technology arrives within the next
<br>
~100 years.  [For simple philisophical reasons I've set aside
<br>
the question of when and whether uploading technology becomes
<br>
available -- since it makes this entire discussion silly.]
<br>
<p>I have no arguments with your characterization of the Iraqi or
<br>
other oil production organizations.  I think the Time article:
<br>
<p>Iraq's Crude Awakening
<br>
D. L. Barlett, J. B. Steele, May 10, 2003
<br>
<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,450939,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,450939,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>discusses the tradeoffs quite well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OPEC can cut its production by 2 million barrels a day and the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production will still be 2-4 milllion barrels a day over demand.
</em><br>
<p>So?  It still isn't *sustainable* over the long term (e.g. thousands
<br>
of years).  And unless one can make a concrete argument that global
<br>
warming will *not* result from oxidizing hydrocarbons currently
<br>
underground and releasing them into the atmosphere then one is,
<br>
IMO, playing with fire.  Go find me a figure as to precisely what
<br>
temperature the oceans must warm up to before the methane clathrates
<br>
on the ocean floors are released into the atmosphere triggering
<br>
a catastrophic global warming event!
<br>
<p>One can scale it back significantly -- are the tornadoes currently
<br>
ravaging the midwest &quot;natural&quot; or are they the result of our gradual
<br>
disruption of the planetary ecosystem.  Stack up ones libertarian
<br>
rights to drive an SUV (driving the U.S. fleet milage down to its
<br>
lowest levels in two decades) with the deaths of people who actually
<br>
may be dealing with the &quot;real&quot; effects of global warming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even then, we will still have ANWR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to drill, which contrary to critics claims, has plenty of oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in it. Enough to seriously dent world oil prices for a decent period of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Mike, I have seen numerous articles detailing that the ANWR isn't going
<br>
to make a *dent* in U.S. oil consumption and/or world oil production.
<br>
If you want to assert this claim you are going to have to make *much*
<br>
stronger claims.
<br>
<p>For the record, the ANWR covers ~20 million acres:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ems.org/arctic_nat_wildlife_refuge/facts.html">http://www.ems.org/arctic_nat_wildlife_refuge/facts.html</a>
<br>
while Iraq covers 437,072 sq km (~108 million acres):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/iz.html">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/iz.html</a>
<br>
(with some arithmetic thrown in).
<br>
<p>The entire ANWR covers about the size of the state of South Carolina
<br>
while Iraq covers ~twice the size of the state of Idaho.  Scaling down
<br>
for the regions with oil underneath (~1.5 million acres of the coastal
<br>
plain in the case of the ANWR vs. the Rumaila/Kirkuk/Majnoun/West Qurna
<br>
oil fields in Iraq) and it is *highly* questionable whether anything
<br>
the ANWR has to contribute would offset the situation in Iraq (or
<br>
even Russia and/or FSR if they ever got their act together).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not concerned about oil prices for the next several years at least.
</em><br>
<p>I was not commenting on *prices* declines so much as whether we would
<br>
be intelligent enough to invest in technologies that would be based on
<br>
sustainability rather than depletion (and potential destruction of
<br>
our environment).
<br>
<p>If we waste the savings in fuel costs we may have over the next 10-20 years
<br>
(due to cheap Iraqi oil) on CDs and DVDs then what has that bought us
<br>
on an extropic agenda?  (A side note to this is may be that a completely
<br>
libertarian agenda based on the pre-programmed &quot;instincts&quot; one &quot;naturally&quot;
<br>
finds in humans is inherently unextropic -- i.e. live for today for tomorrow
<br>
you may be dead.)
