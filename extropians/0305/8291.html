<p>Saving Private Lynch story 'flawed'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
By John Kampfner  
<br>
<p>Private Jessica Lynch became an icon of the war, and
<br>
the story of her capture by the Iraqis and her rescue
<br>
by US special forces became one of the great patriotic
<br>
moments of the conflict. 
<br>
<p>But her story is one of the most stunning pieces of
<br>
news management ever conceived. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Private Lynch, a 19-year-old army clerk from
<br>
Palestine, West Virginia, was captured when her
<br>
company took a wrong turning just outside Nasiriya and
<br>
was ambushed. 
<br>
<p>Nine of her comrades were killed and Private Lynch was
<br>
taken to the local hospital, which at the time was
<br>
swarming with Fedayeen. Eight days later US special
<br>
forces stormed the hospital, capturing the &quot;dramatic&quot;
<br>
events on a night vision camera. 
<br>
<p>They were said to have come under fire from inside and
<br>
outside the building, but they made it to Lynch and
<br>
whisked her away by helicopter. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Reports claimed that she had stab and bullet wounds
<br>
and that she had been slapped about on her hospital
<br>
bed and interrogated. 
<br>
<p>But Iraqi doctors in Nasiriya say they provided the
<br>
best treatment they could for the soldier in the midst
<br>
of war. She was assigned the only specialist bed in
<br>
the hospital and one of only two nurses on the floor. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I examined her, I saw she had a broken arm, a broken
<br>
thigh and a dislocated ankle,&quot; said Dr Harith
<br>
a-Houssona, who looked after her. 
<br>
<p>&quot;There was no [sign of] shooting, no bullet inside her
<br>
body, no stab wound - only road traffic accident. They
<br>
want to distort the picture. I don't know why they
<br>
think there is some benefit in saying she has a bullet
<br>
injury.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Witnesses told us that the special forces knew that
<br>
the Iraqi military had fled a day before they swooped
<br>
on the hospital. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Dr Uday was surprised by the manner of the rescue 
<br>
&quot;We were surprised. Why do this? There was no
<br>
military, there were no soldiers in the hospital,&quot;
<br>
said Dr Anmar Uday, who worked at the hospital. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It was like a Hollywood film. They cried 'go, go,
<br>
go', with guns and blanks without bullets, blanks and
<br>
the sound of explosions. They made a show for the
<br>
American attack on the hospital - action movies like
<br>
Sylvester Stallone or Jackie Chan.&quot; 
<br>
<p>There was one more twist. Two days before the snatch
<br>
squad arrived, Harith had arranged to deliver Jessica
<br>
to the Americans in an ambulance. 
<br>
<p>But as the ambulance, with Private Lynch inside,
<br>
approached a checkpoint American troops opened fire,
<br>
forcing it to flee back to the hospital. The Americans
<br>
had almost killed their prize catch. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Some brave souls put their lives on the line to make
<br>
this happen
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p>General Vincent Brooks
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>When footage of the rescue was released, General
<br>
Vincent Brooks, US spokesman in Doha, said: &quot;Some
<br>
brave souls put their lives on the line to make this
<br>
happen, loyal to a creed that they know that they'll
<br>
never leave a fallen comrade.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The American strategy was to ensure the right
<br>
television footage by using embedded reporters and
<br>
images from their own cameras, editing the film
<br>
themselves. 
<br>
<p>The Pentagon had been influenced by Hollywood
<br>
producers of reality TV and action movies, notably the
<br>
man behind Black Hawk Down, Jerry Bruckheimer. 
<br>
<p>Bruckheimer advised the Pentagon on the primetime
<br>
television series &quot;Profiles from the Front Line&quot;, that
<br>
followed US forces in Afghanistan in 2001. That
<br>
approached was taken on and developed on the field of
<br>
battle in Iraq. 
<br>
<p>As for Private Lynch, her status as cult hero is
<br>
stronger than ever. Internet auction sites list
<br>
Jessica Lynch items, from an oil painting with an
<br>
opening bid of $200 to a $5 &quot;America Loves Jessica
<br>
Lynch&quot; fridge magnet. 
<br>
<p>But doctors now say she has no recollection of the
<br>
whole episode and probably never will.
