&quot;Way past Ikea lies a Swedish housing complex that is ecologically

sound and wired for all sorts of remote-control fiddling with heat,
<br>
power and security.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>It takes tech to tango
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by Raul Barreneche                                 May 2003
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.popsci.com/popsci/hometech/article/0,12543,448268,00.html">http://www.popsci.com/popsci/hometech/article/0,12543,448268,00.html</a>
<br>
<p><p><p>Peter Söderholm pays two or three times the market rate for the
<br>
850-square-foot apartment he and his wife moved into last year in
<br>
the Swedish city of Malmö, an apartment about half the size of their
<br>
previous home. That's quite a premium for a unit located on a
<br>
contaminated former Saab factory site, even if it sits by the sea
<br>
and on a clear day offers a view of the Danish coast 10 miles away.
<br>
But Söderholm and his wife, Gunvor, are happy to pay: They live in
<br>
Tango, a green-and-wired 27-unit complex that decontaminates its own
<br>
soil, recycles its water into a rebuilt marsh ecology, generates
<br>
power from renewable sources, uses roof space to put oxygen back
<br>
into the environment and, through sensors and broadband Web access,
<br>
allows owners to re-motely monitor and control everything from
<br>
energy use to electronic key access. Söderholm can sit on his
<br>
balcony, survey the Øresund like a sea captain, and know that he
<br>
lives in a showcase for the convergence of home technologies that,
<br>
piece by piece, are popping up in developments in Europe and the
<br>
United States. Tango won an important building-of-the-year award in
<br>
Sweden last year and in January won an American Institute of
<br>
Architects award for its progressive integration of technology,
<br>
sustainability and lifestyle-focused design.
<br>
<p>&quot;We put our money into where we live; that's our priority,&quot; says
<br>
Söderholm. &quot;This green aspect was very important to us because for
<br>
many years we've felt that we're all wasting our natural re-sources.
<br>
I think you can have a good standard of living and use energy
<br>
responsibly. You don't have to feel bad about living well.&quot;
<br>
<p>Tango isn't a technology showcase by accident: It was built for the
<br>
BoO1 exhibition, one of a series of Swedish housing fairs, held in
<br>
Malmö in 2001. Along with the residential units, BoO1 also featured
<br>
offices, cafés, day care centers, a school and a library. Söderholm
<br>
says that walking through it was a bit like wandering through a
<br>
world's fair, except that people were already inhabiting the
<br>
pavilions-including the Söderholms. &quot;During the fair, I was out on
<br>
my balcony a lot,&quot; says Söderholm, &quot;wanting to throw bananas at
<br>
people.&quot;
<br>
<p>European firms developed most of the architecture on display, except
<br>
for Tango, which was designed by Moore Ruble Yudell Architects &amp;
<br>
Planners of Santa Monica, California. The company worked locally
<br>
with FFNS Architects, a Swedish firm. MRY, known more for its
<br>
cheerful, postmodernist approach to residential architecture than
<br>
its tech focus, created an appealing, bright, courtyard-facing
<br>
design whose units include floor-to-ceiling glass doors and windows
<br>
framed in a rainbow of colors. But, says MRY senior associate and
<br>
Tango project architect James O'Connor, &quot;from the start, we wanted
<br>
ours to be the most technologically advanced project at the fair.&quot;
<br>
<p>Tango began with a brownfield site, the term applied to abandoned,
<br>
usually polluted former industrial lands. Brownfield redevelopment
<br>
often deploys barrier, venting and cleaning technologies to deal
<br>
with soil and water contaminants, site instability and subterranean
<br>
gas buildups. In this case, much soil was removed, and the landscape
<br>
was replanted with species that extract pollutants-often heavy
<br>
metals-from the soil, and others that immobilize them. (Some, like
<br>
river birch, are metal accumulators that act like wicks, drawing
<br>
metals into their trunks; grasses, meanwhile, trap compounds in
<br>
their roots.) The site topography was shaped and planted to mimic,
<br>
on the development's east side, the marshy ecology of the sound,
<br>
with vegetation fed by recycled rainwater. Grass planted on the
<br>
roofs provides a layer of overhead insulation, slows flooding during
<br>
heavy rains, and pumps oxygen into the atmosphere. Construction
<br>
methods and materials hewed to ecological building standards that
<br>
Malmö had set for the district.
<br>
<p><p>The most striking part of Tango's design is the floor-to-ceiling
<br>
windows of the courtyard-facing units: superb for brightening a room
<br>
during a gloomy Swedish day, but a potential energy sink during
<br>
winter nights. Triple-glazed windows with a layer of inert argon gas
<br>
between the two outermost panes keep the heat in: Their R-value (a
<br>
measure of thermal conductivity) is about 6.5, compared with 1.5 to
<br>
2 for typical American double-paned glass. The units were tightly
<br>
built, with wall-mounted ventilators to draw in fresh air and keep
<br>
the rooms from getting stale or stuffy.
<br>
<p>Vacuum-tube solar collectors on the rooftops convert sunlight into
<br>
heat for the units; a nearby wind turbine, meanwhile, supplies
<br>
electricity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From the start, the plan was to optimize efficiency by taking
<br>
advantage of information technology. Tango apartments are supplied
<br>
with laptops that connect to the developer's broadband network;
<br>
through a portal called Frontyard, residents can access myriad
<br>
monitoring and control systems. Söderholm admits that there was a
<br>
learning curve for what he calls &quot;the cockpit.&quot;
<br>
<p>Frontyard allows owners to access a security camera to see who's at
<br>
the front door, book a guest apartment in the development, and scan
<br>
an electronic weather station that displays actual and forecast
<br>
temperatures and wind conditions. Electronic keys can be set to
<br>
admit visitors during scheduled times- a housekeeper, an overnight
<br>
guest or repairman. There's an electronic bulletin board and a
<br>
choice of how tenants can be notified-e-mail, text message, fax or
<br>
voice mail-if the burglar or fire alarm is activated. These are the
<br>
basics. But Frontyard also allows the Söderholms to turn lights on
<br>
and off while away from home or to preprogram lighting schemes; set
<br>
temperatures for every room and change them remotely (saving power
<br>
if they're delayed); or preheat a room for a late-night return. An
<br>
alarm lets them know if the temperature is off-target. Windows can
<br>
be opened and closed electronically. The guiding notion: An
<br>
energy-aware user is a more efficient user.
<br>
<p>None of Tango's features are in themselves revolutionary, but
<br>
together they represent a benchmark. &quot;It's the thoroughness of the
<br>
application,&quot; says John Ruble, a principal designer at MRY. &quot;Our
<br>
building is a mix of highly ambitious sustainable measures-the green
<br>
roofs, the energy-efficient glass-plus the electronics and
<br>
information technology. We went very far with these things, but it's
<br>
still experimental. There's a lot of stuff that needs to be
<br>
studied.&quot;
<br>
<p>Experiments are under way in the United States. A 44-unit
<br>
single-room-occupancy housing project in downtown Santa Monica
<br>
generates power via giant photovoltaic panels on its exterior walls
<br>
and a cogeneration system that turns natural gas into electricity.
<br>
Coffee Creek, a 640-acre mixed-use development in northwestern
<br>
Indiana, is being built from ecologically friendly materials and
<br>
will feature photovoltaics and wind-generated electricity.
<br>
<p>Progress is slow-a lot slower than it would be, say, if energy
<br>
prices in the United States were as high as those in Sweden. &quot;Not
<br>
very many architects are doing this kind of housing,&quot; says MRY's
<br>
O'Connor. &quot;It's very new and groundbreaking in a lot of ways.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Trained as an architect, Raul Barreneche is a contributing editor at
<br>
Architectural Record and Travel &amp; Leisure. His book Tropical Modern
<br>
will be published by Rizzoli/Universe this fall.

<br>
A. Sun &amp; Wind Power: Rooftop vacuum-tube solar
<br>
collectors-insulated to work in cold weather-convert solar
<br>
energy to heat, which feeds into the Tango complex and a larger
<br>
district heat system. Nearby wind turbines supply Tango with
<br>
electricity. B. Grass Roofs: In a nod to traditional
<br>
Scandinavian sod roofs, Tango's elevated greenlands provide
<br>
added insulation, replenish oxygen and help slow water runoff
<br>
during heavy storms. Grass surrounds each of the slanted solar
<br>
panels, and is on other roofs too. C. Safer Soil: Before
<br>
construction of Tango began, the city of Malmö treated the
<br>
polluted soil on this former industrial site, then laid five
<br>
feet of clean dirt on top. Around the site, meanwhile,
<br>
bioremediators (trees and grasses that trap metals and
<br>
pollutants) bolster the quality of the soil by absorbing toxins.
<br>
D. Big Windows: Floor-to-ceiling windows are glorious but can be
<br>
a heat loss problem. The Designers use French-made triple-glazed
<br>
windows with a layer of trapped argon gas. Result: High
<br>
insulation factors. Benefit: Sun-warmed air heats the tightly
<br>
built units, and remote-controllable ventilation maintains
<br>
temperatures. E. Intelligent Wall: A so-called intelligent wall
<br>
runs through the development. A spinal cord for the data system,
<br>
it allows residents to access, through a portal called
<br>
Frontyard, many of Tango's heat, power, intranet and security
<br>
systems by in-house laptop, remote computer or cellphone.
