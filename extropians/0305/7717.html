</em><br>
<p>You are obviously talking to the wrong kind of nutritional scientists.  I
<br>
have never heard of any &quot;scientists&quot; who uses the circular logic you
<br>
describe.  You are correct in your refutation of that pseudo-science.  My
<br>
only confusion is why you project that on modern nutritional scientists and
<br>
studies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Paleodiet theory answers the question with a true explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The paleodiet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorist explains: &quot;Fruits and vegetables are good for human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they contain substances, some discovered and probably also some as yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undiscovered, to which the human genome became adapted over millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years of evolution. Our friends the nutritionists can supply us with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the known biological mechanisms of some of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and those descriptions are certainly very useful, but that is all they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do. They cannot in the end tell us *why* these plant substances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are good for human health.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>A basic description of evolution.  I see no contradiction between it and
<br>
&quot;nutritional science&quot; as you seem to.  I totally agree with evolution and
<br>
with modern nutritional science.  I see no contradiction between them.
<br>
Surprisingly, I also don't dispute most of your examples of bad science,
<br>
because I agree they are bad science.  I just don't see scientists doing
<br>
what you claim.  I still don't believe the Food Pyramid and the Basic Four
<br>
food groups represent scientists.  I still believe they are marketing tools
<br>
invented by various industries.  I don't see nutritional scientists using
<br>
pseudo-science and false logic as you seem to claim.  And while I agree that
<br>
the simplified level of nutrition filtering down to the sound-bite world of
<br>
mass consumptions seems to be producing contradicting sound-bites, I rarely
<br>
see massive disagreement between mainstream scientists as you seem to think
<br>
is occurring constantly.   Nutritional science is a basic branch of
<br>
biochemistry that is growing, adapting, and discovering more knowledge all
<br>
the time.  It is not a pseudoscience, false science or misleading science in
<br>
any way.  Biochemistry and Human Medicine are probably the most advanced
<br>
sciences on earth, with the most research dollars, and the fastest knowledge
<br>
doubling time than most fields.
