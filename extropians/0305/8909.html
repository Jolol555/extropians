<br>
<p><em>&gt; Excellent comments, Lee!  I look forward to hearing more.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks a lot, Harvey!  Yes, I'll get right to it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes, there is a truth to factual questions, I agree.  What I meant or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions about goals, motives and &quot;goodness&quot;.  As you pointed out, some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would let a thousand criminals go free rather than execute one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent.  Other people rather kill a few innocents to get more criminals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are goal-based decisions.  I am not sure either one can be argued as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;right&quot; or proven logically.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it certainly seems so.  But I like even better my example
<br>
about *inequality* and how people will disagree about its
<br>
distastefulness.  Now if Robin, Hal, and Wei Dai are right,
<br>
then somehow this all boils down to something that can be
<br>
agreed upon by rational altruists. (!)  I am still baffled
<br>
by this denouement, as are perhaps yourself and Rafal.
<br>
<p>Who knows?  Perhaps liberals overestimate how grating inequality
<br>
is to the poor, (and sympathetic), or conservative-libertarians
<br>
underestimate it.  So maybe on this case they could be right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (This reminds me of the copy and kill question.  We can agree on every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single atom in a thought experiment and still disagree on how to label or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluate what was described.)
</em><br>
<p>Oh no!  In that case, people who don't regard copies as selves
<br>
are merely Wrong.   ;-)
