Interesting alternate history scenario. I found it amusing anyway. 
<br>
Actually, I agree with every word in it.

<p>&lt;&lt;President Gore: A Look Back
<br>
by Ted Rall
<br>
<p>DAYTON, OHIO--Few political observers anticipated the widespread 
<br>
resentment that followed Al Gore's controversial assumption of the 
<br>
presidency in December 2000. &quot;The U.S. Supreme Court merely adhered to 
<br>
the Constitution when it refused to hear Bush's appeal of the Florida 
<br>
ruling,&quot; notes a Harvard law professor now living in exile in France. 
<br>
&quot;Federal courts have no jurisdiction over election disputes, which in 
<br>
the United States are a state matter.&quot; Although the ensuing recount 
<br>
ultimately gave Florida to Gore by a comfortable thousand-vote margin, 
<br>
Republicans refused to accept the results. Talk radio host Rush Limbaugh 
<br>
continued to refer to Gore as &quot;Vice President Gore&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;Resident-in-Chief&quot; and listed the time remaining in Gore's first term 
<br>
as &quot;days left in captivity for the American people.&quot;
<br>
<p>Republican candidate George W. Bush, meanwhile, refused to concede 
<br>
defeat. &quot;Make no mistake,&quot; the former Texas governor declared from 
<br>
self-proclaimed &quot;internal exile&quot; in Crawford, Texas, &quot;that man will 
<br>
never be my president.&quot; The GOP filed a slew of lawsuits challenging the 
<br>
election results, and right-wing militia groups issued dark threats 
<br>
about overthrowing Gore's &quot;illegal junta.&quot;
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Incredibly, the next move of the man dubbed &quot;Gore out of control&quot; by Fox 
<br>
News was to declare an unprovoked war on Iraq. &quot;Saddam Hussein has 
<br>
weapons of mass destruction, he's an evil dictator and he's a threat to 
<br>
world peace,&quot; Gore railed to a joint session of Congress. When the 
<br>
United Nations refused to support Gore's request for an international 
<br>
coalition, even Congressional Democrats decided that they had had enough 
<br>
of their bellicose leader, and joined their counterparts across the 
<br>
aisle. &quot;There's no proof that Saddam Hussein has WMDs,&quot; declared Senate 
<br>
Majority Leader Tom Daschle. &quot;Until that changes, we have no grounds for 
<br>
a preemptive strike--an act that violates every precept of international 
<br>
law.&quot; Nonetheless, Gore relied on the War Powers Act to order in the 
<br>
Marines.
<br>
<p>As we know, Saddam Hussein didn't use nuclear, biological or chemical 
<br>
weapons to defend his dying regime. American forces never found any. And 
<br>
news soon began leaking that Gore was awarding lucrative Iraqi 
<br>
rebuilding contracts to oil companies that had contributed to his 2000 
<br>
campaign. A Gallup poll showed that 88 percent of Americans considered 
<br>
Gore a liar, and that 79 percent favored his removal from office and 
<br>
prosecution for the wanton murder of thousands of Iraqis. As Iraq 
<br>
degenerated into sectarian violence amid growing signs of a possible 
<br>
radical Islamic revolution, Gore brazenly categorized the mayhem he had 
<br>
wrought on an innocent people as liberation. &quot;They don't know it yet,&quot; 
<br>
he proclaimed, &quot;but they'll thank us for this someday.&quot;
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>What will it take for the American people to turn this madman out on his 
<br>
ear once and for all? It's impossible to say. As things stand now, he 
<br>
could put babies on the White House menu and claim he was fighting 
<br>
overpopulation.&gt;&gt;
