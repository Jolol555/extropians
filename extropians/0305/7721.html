</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually I was not referring to any pseudo-science in the nutrition field. I
<br>
was referring to the best of nutrition science, and I would not label them
<br>
&quot;pseudo-scientists.&quot; There is a need for an understanding of the mechanisms
<br>
by which substances we've identified as &quot;nutrients&quot; are used by the body to
<br>
promote good health. Nutrition science has its place in the world.
<br>
<p>My point is that nutrition science, even at its best, cannot answer the
<br>
larger questions without relying on evolution science. And there they will
<br>
find the paleodiet theorists, ready and waiting with an answer and a diet to
<br>
match. 
<br>
<p>Nutrition science is not teaching humanity anything new; it is merely
<br>
discovering what millions of years of evolution has already given us: a
<br>
natural adaptation to the substances found in paleolithic foods. The ongoing
<br>
discoveries of beneficial substances in fruits and vegetables are perfect
<br>
examples. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see no contradiction between [evolution] and &quot;nutritional science&quot; as
</em><br>
you seem to. 
<br>
<p>Well, now I'm confused, because I see in your arguments an unwillingness to
<br>
accept the idea that paleolithic foods are better suited to our diet than
<br>
modern non-paleo foods. For example it seems you want to recommend a diet
<br>
containing significant amounts of legumes, but this view is contrary to the
<br>
diet upon which we evolved. If you have any scientific basis for your
<br>
opinion in favor of legumes then your arguments must come from nutrition
<br>
science rather than from evolution science, because in this case the latter
<br>
contradicts the former.
