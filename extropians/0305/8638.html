</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; [Agriculture] also set us on the path towards culture, superhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence and the stars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is akin to the &quot;progressivist perspective,&quot; which Diamond flatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejects.
</em><br>
<p>Only because he focuses on a small portion of history and a few
<br>
effects and totally sweeps the rest under the rug. Sure, early
<br>
agriculture wasn't an immediate success, and the evidence of that
<br>
is good. As he points out, the life expectancy of hunter-gatherers
<br>
was 26, while that of early agriculurists fell to 19. Well, OK,
<br>
but last time I looked we've moved forward a bit since then.
<br>
<p>Yes, agriculture enabled population density that spread disease
<br>
and created a lot of social ills, and maybe didn't increase spare
<br>
time. But it did enable things like specialization, trade, mass
<br>
education, large-scale construction, and everything else that
<br>
got us a lot further than those early agriculturalists. And those
<br>
first few plagues killed off enough that those left (and we,
<br>
their descendents) are likely better adapted to the new lifestyle.
<br>
<p>As was already pointed out, Diamond shows only that hunting
<br>
and gathering was a local maximum, which says nothing at all
<br>
about whether it is an optimum in the big picture.
<br>
