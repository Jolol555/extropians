<p>I don't know, but I would not doubt that figure.
<br>
<p>I do know that the infamous press conference was proceeded by a meeting with
<br>
lawyers who assured Clinton that the dictionary definition of &quot;sexual
<br>
relations&quot; did not include oral sex. 
<br>
<p>Of course the prize for the biggest whopper goes to Richard &quot;I am not a
<br>
crook&quot; Nixon. But I think Slick Willy beats Tricky Dick any day for the most
<br>
audacious acting performance. 
<br>
<p>The &quot;that woman&quot; phrase was an especially nice touch. When his mouth was
<br>
saying &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman&quot; his eyes were
<br>
saying &quot;...with that treacherous lying bitch&quot; and that is I think exactly
<br>
what most Clinton supporters heard at the time.
