Terry quotes from Mark Steyn's piece in the National Post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now another Middle Eastern war has come and gone, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bien-pensants are anxious that once again an obsolescent institution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be glued back together and propped in position. This time it's the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN. The editors of Britain's Spectator concede it has more than its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share of &quot;irritating do-gooders,&quot; but surely even that's a euphemism: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The do-gooders are, in fact, do-badders. The &quot;oil-for-palaces&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program (as Tommy Franks calls it) is a grotesque boondoggle even by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN standards: It was good for bureaucrats, good for Saddam's European 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bankers, good for his British stooge George Galloway, but bad for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi people. A humanitarian operation meant to help a dictator's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beleagured subjects has instead enriched the UN by over $1-billion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (officially) in &quot;administrative&quot; costs. There's no oversight, no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auditing, nothing most businesses would recognize as a legitimate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invoice, and, although non-essential items can only be approved by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Secretary-General himself, Kofi Annan (Mister Legitimacy) has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally signed off on practically anything Saddam requested, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including &quot;boats,&quot; from France.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the U.N. has become quite corrupt.  Is it time for it to go?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't have to agree (though I do) with George Jonas that the UN 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a fully fledged member of the axis of evil to recognize that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's little point in going to war to install yet another branch 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office of UNSCAM. If the problem is America's image in the Arab 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, in what way does it help to confine the Stars and Stripes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brand to unpleasant things like bombs while insisting all the nice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-war reconstructive stuff be clearly labelled with the UN flag? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the answer is that that's the price you pay for healing the rift 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Old Europe, that presupposes Old Europe is interested in healing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Tony Blair may be keen, but the Continentals have different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agendas. Will the Belgian government approve the complaint against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tommy Franks for &quot;genocide&quot;? The petition accuses the General of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;inaction in the face of hospital pillaging,&quot; which apparently meets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Belgian definition of genocide. Unlike the deaths of over three 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million people, which is the lowball figure for those who've died in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current civil war in the Congo -- or, as I still like to think of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, the Belgian Congo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Congo's civil war is everything the NIONists (Not In Our Name) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claimed Bush's war would be: There were more civilian deaths in a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours in Ituri province last week than in the entire Iraq campaign; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the blowhards at Oxfam and co -- the Big Consciences lobby -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insist on pretending that Iraq is a humanitarian disaster, there's an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual humanitarian disaster going on in the Congo, complete with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of children dead from disease and malnutrition. While the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lefties warned that Ariel Sharon would use the cover of the Iraq war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to slaughter the Palestinians, the Congolese are being slaughtered, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you don't need any cover. Because nobody cares. Because no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrogant Americans or sinister Zionists are involved.
</em><br>
<p>That's it exactly, of course.  
<br>
<p>However, I think that the trouble with the U.S. leaving the U.N.
<br>
would be that it would play right into the hands of America's
<br>
enemies. &quot;See! They're so out of control that they won't even
<br>
talk anymore!&quot;
<br>
<p>One's first reaction is, so what?  Now I agree that the United States
<br>
should learn to start caring less about what other countries think
<br>
and more about what they will do.
<br>
<p>Yet there comes a time when, whether it's trade negotiations or
<br>
human rights issues, Americans should indeed worry about what the
<br>
rest of the world will do.  Allowing the French and Russians to
<br>
set the standard for human rights, or allowing a lot of America-
<br>
haters to weaken international trade is not in anyone's real
<br>
interest.
<br>
<p>So the U.S. should continue to support the same goofy charade at
<br>
the U.N., and hope that over time irrational hatreds subside and
<br>
cooperativeness and genuine humanitarianism increase.
<br>
