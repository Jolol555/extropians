<p><em>&gt; Anyone bother to look up the second study mentioned near the end of

</em><br>
<p>I have not looked at it. However from the data from this study currently
<br>
under consideration it appears that both low-carb and low-fat diets improve
<br>
insulin sensitivity. Here is the data:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-carb          Conventional      p value  
<br>
Mo 3		6.7 			4.1 			0.37
<br>
Mo 6		5.8 			5.2 			0.79
<br>
Mo 12		2.9 			2.9 			0.92
<br>
<p>The p value is for the difference between the means. For those here who
<br>
might need a refresher in stat, the p value represents the probability that
<br>
one would be in error if one concluded that the two samples come from
<br>
different populations. In this specific case the p value is the probability
<br>
that one would be in error if one concluded that the low-carb diet was
<br>
different from the conventional diet. Statisticians generally don't draw any
<br>
conclusions unless there is statistical significance, defined as p &lt; .05.
<br>
<p>So then from this data there is no reason to conclude that low-carb diets do
<br>
any more to improve insulin sensitivity than do conventional diets, though
<br>
it does appear that both diets improve insulin sensitivity. This only makes
<br>
sense; many studies show that insulin sensitivity is most strongly
<br>
correlated with body fat, so any means of losing fat should improve insulin
<br>
sensitivity.
<br>
<p>The researchers also tested area under the glucose curve and area under the
<br>
insulin curve, both of which are measures closely related to measures of
<br>
insulin sensitivity. They found no significant differences between the two
<br>
diets.
