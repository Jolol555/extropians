<p><em>&gt; If you are trying to be rational, it's something of a danger sign if

</em><br>
<p>Or it's a sign that you have trouble forming a firm opinion.  Like I said, I'd
<br>
suggest to friends and family that maybe getting rid of Saddam would be a good
<br>
thing in of itself, despite the lies and dubious leadership, having worried
<br>
myself I was just following my local party line.  Over here, with all the
<br>
people saying &quot;we gotta stop the WMDs!&quot; I backed my party line.  Eventually I
<br>
soured on having strong opinions on complex issues with crappy data where my
<br>
opinion doesn't really matter anyway.
<br>
<p>One change I've had is that I thought at the time that bombing the Taliban was
<br>
a fine thing.  I said that even if al Qaeda wasn't connected to 9/11 the
<br>
Taliban sucked and deserved getting some neoimperialist asskicking.  Now... I
<br>
still lean that way, but what I hear of Afghanistan makes it harder for me to
<br>
feel the case is solid.  A bunch of people got killed, Kabul got liberated,
<br>
but things outside didn't change that much and there's still no stability.
<br>
<p>Which gets back to another anti-war concern, that we'd mess up Iraq and not
<br>
have the staying power to clean things up properly.  But it's too soon to
<br>
change an opinion there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Grounds for suspicion only arise if your before-and-after position was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one supported by your ideology.
</em><br>
<p>See, my ideologies say &quot;human rights should be enforced&quot; and &quot;Bush can't be
<br>
trusted at all and we should oppose anything which help him get re-elected&quot;.
<br>
You can see the conflict...
