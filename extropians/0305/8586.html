<p>One theory is that hes already dead, but that we haven't bothered to tell 
<br>
anyone (or don't have confirmation).  If Osama was alive he would have 
<br>
every incentive to tell the world, to boost flagging morale.  If he kept 
<br>
the video to the barest of minimums, I would assume that he could prevent 
<br>
us from learning anything of importance from it regarding his 
<br>
location.  After all, if wealthy Muslims perceive Al Queda as being 
<br>
leaderless, they are less likely to donate large sums of money.  On the 
<br>
other hand, if Osama is dead, he can be proclaimed a martyr, and a new 
<br>
leader can step into his place.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, we have a professional rather than a volunteer force, 
<br>
and the news of our success in Osama's death is more likely to decrease 
<br>
than increase defense and intelligence funding.  So if our military or 
<br>
intelligence agencies were able to kill him they would have no reason to 
<br>
tell the public, and we would be in the situation we are in now, with 
<br>
nobody knowing where Osama is.  Then again, he might have been killed in a 
<br>
way that rendered his body unidentifiable, and we'd be in a similar situation.
<br>
<p>Of course, this doesn't explain the current attacks, so maybe the theory 
<br>
needs some reworking.
<br>
<p><p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume your 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
