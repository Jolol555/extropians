</em><br>
<p>Yes, I would vote for restrictions on hunting. But my vote would be lost
<br>
in the mass of votes in favor of unrestricted hunting. And of course, in
<br>
all serious likelihood, it will never come to a vote. I've never heard of
<br>
a referendum on hunting in my state.
<br>
<p>I would not *lobby* for anything, since I have too many other things to
<br>
do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### As Mike noted, what hunters try is one thing, and what they get is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something else altogether.
</em><br>
<p>That is so reassuring. :) Then I could hope that all hunters would be that
<br>
incompetent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ### If enough people are really concerned about the welfare of deer
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I might be digressing here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People don't know what they want. Hunters know they want to hunt, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the political system is designed to match their intentions. Animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lovers are too disorganized, politically naive or unconnected, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no political system (machine) in place. What people *want*, and how

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; People don't want smog in their cities, either, but there it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### You've been roundly castigated for this &quot;People don't know...&quot; remark,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I won't add much here, aside from noting that restrictions on hunting are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being quite widely adopted, as a result of the relentless pressure from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greenish organizations.
</em><br>
<p>I am not aware of any new recent restrictions on hunting in my state. I am
<br>
also not aware of any &quot;greenish organizations&quot; here that have more than a
<br>
handful of members.
<br>
<p>What people &quot;want&quot; is often lodged in their subconscious, or out of view,
<br>
or manipulated by advertising and the media, or manufactured by social
<br>
consensus (conformity to old behavioral memes). People often want
<br>
contradictory things - say, a house in the countryside, but also a
<br>
subdivision and stores conveniently close by. So they often get a mess,
<br>
and wish that they had not done certain things, or regret certain
<br>
decisions they have made, after it is too late. Decisions are made just as
<br>
often by the system as by people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would bet that the majority of the readers of your initial statement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I don't feel any need to remunerate hunters for loss of &quot;hobby&quot;, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; more than I would feel the need to remunerate child molestors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; depriving them of the ability to molest children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would see it as putting hunters into the same class as child molesters, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expression of scorn, and possibly a psychological manipulation, well beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tame interpretation you advanced above.
</em><br>
<p>Well then *they* don't know how to read or think logically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just admit it - you hate hunters! :-)
</em><br>
<p>I hate people putting words in my mouth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why bother being happy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Life, freedom and truth, for their own sake, are what I want, all else is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bonus.
</em><br>
<p>Then I hope one of your bonuses will be happiness. And I hope you discover
<br>
the truth about how animals can be appreciated more than you now
<br>
appreciate them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### You are anthropomorphizing deer. They do not attach significance to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer life, since they do not have the concept of a time-invariant self.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore killing them is ethically neutral, and if it results on average in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduced suffering (freedom from wildcats, diseases of old age, accidents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc), like a shot to the heart, it is clearly ethically superior.
</em><br>
<p>It would be anthropomorphizing if I equated, wrongly, anything in
<br>
particular about a deer with something about a human. But that is not the
<br>
case. Deer do not need to have a concept of self at all in order to enjoy
<br>
a longer life, or a life free from gunshots.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Attaching ethical significance to longer life of deer is like attaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significance to the wishes of inanimate objects, so common in animists.
</em><br>
<p>In order to argue logically, you have to avoid obvious fallacies, like
<br>
this one, false analogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### How many deer have you sterilized? Was it fun?
</em><br>
<p>I haven't sterilized a deer, but I've sterilized many other animals. And
<br>
it made me feel good about myself, that I was doing so to prevent an
<br>
excess of unwanted animals who could not be cared for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Deer are &quot;individuals&quot;? How do you know? How many have you talked to?
</em><br>
<p>This question moves through fallacy into the comic, so I will assume you
<br>
aren't interested in an answer. I can *see* you've made up your mind, and
<br>
since I am not arguing to convince myself, I'll let you have the last word
<br>
again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Just wait a few decades and even this will be possible, thanks to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market-driven and government-supported progress of science. All you need is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to clone the DNA, assemble it into a genome, and voila, you have your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammoth steak, and T.Rex-safari.
</em><br>
<p>The market will provide... IF I wait a few decades and IF there is a
<br>
viable DNA sample ... and IF I can afford the product.
<br>
<p>The market is a pretty poor excuse for a deity, don't you think?
