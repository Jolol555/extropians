&lt;&lt;I woman I know once rescued a kid from rising
<br>
flood waters in a gorge. The reporter who covered the story essentially
<br>
condemned her for keeping her infant in her backpack while she effected
<br>
the rescue, as if this made her a terrible mother and person rather
<br>
than the hero she was and is. When she confronted the reporter about
<br>
the facts of the situation, the reporter said, &quot;I don't care what you
<br>
think, I decide what the real story is and there's nothing you can do
<br>
about it, bitch.&quot;

<br>
<p>Let us not forget that Eason Jordan of CNN, has admitted to, in a NYTimes 
<br>
confession, of deliberately hiding information to the public, over the past 
<br>
12 years of Saddam's execution of political opponents; so as not to risk CNN 
<br>
news expulsion from Iraq. Look at Ted Turner's lionization of Castro. In my 
<br>
opinion this casts him (Turner) as merely a rich thug, not unlike Joe 
<br>
Kennedy' and his romance with Hitler.
<br>
I summarize with the proposition that being rich and well-positioned, does 
<br>
apparently not make one wise. But I suppose the real issue isn't wisdom, but 
<br>
power and its pursuits.
