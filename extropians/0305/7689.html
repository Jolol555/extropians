<p>Mike, you may have missed the way that Brian and gts &quot;reinterpreted&quot; the
<br>
studies to say the opposite of what the original authors said.  The original
<br>
studies advocated a lot of grains in the diet.  Brian and gts dismissed the
<br>
parts of the study they didn't like, but kept the parts they did like, and
<br>
then reinterpreted the results to enforce rather deny the Paleo diet.  They
<br>
then claimed the study reinforced their anti-grain diet.  This totally
<br>
contradicts the report's conclusion that &quot;New evidences supports the theory
<br>
that a high-fiber diet, including grains, cereals and fruits substantially
<br>
lowers the risk of colon cancer.&quot;  There is nothing in this study that
<br>
supports the Paleo Diet.  It specifically studied a high-grain non-Paleo
<br>
diet.
<br>
<p>I am tired of seeing &quot;scientific evidence&quot; being misrepresented here.  Most
<br>
people don't have time to go double-check sources presented.  If someone
<br>
claims that a study just came out that shows such-and-such, most people will
<br>
take that statement at face value.  I am not used to finding such studies
<br>
misrepresented, or worse, &quot;reinterpreted&quot; to say things that the original
<br>
author never intended.  This is very sloppy evidence at best, and
<br>
intellectual fraud at worse.
<br>
<p>This Paleo Diet &quot;religion&quot; thread seems to be worst at this.  There are
<br>
logical fallacies and misrepresented scientific studies.  When people point
<br>
out specific flaws or misrepresentation, they are ignored or talked to
<br>
death.  In the final analysis, I don't have much complaint about the diet.
<br>
People can avoid random food groups if they want, as long as they are
<br>
getting their nutrition elsewhere.  However, I greatly object to the
<br>
/methods/ used to reach these conclusions and persuade others into them.
<br>
They are religious, illogical, unscientific, and fraudulent.  This kind of
<br>
sloppy reasoning, even for a correct position, ends up weakening the
<br>
argument, and even weakening the discussion group.  People reading this
<br>
stuff would (rightly in this narrow case) classify us as religious cultists
<br>
who use circular logic and pseudoscience to prove our believes to others as
<br>
if they were established scientific fact.
<br>
<p>The Extropians List didn't used to be like this.
