<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20Boy%20Genius%20or%20Craft%20Idiot?">fauxever@sprynet.com</a> writes: Put another way, is being deceitful ever smart?  IMO yes.  If a 
<br>
religious nut with a gun to my temple asked me whether I believed in god, I 
<br>
would lie and say &quot;yes.&quot;  Question:  Who's keeping score here?  Answer:  The 
<br>
religious nut with the gun to my temple (at least, temporarily).  
<br>
<p>Olga,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can return to Earth at this time.  Has a religious nut ever put a 
<br>
gun to your head?  How about the head of someone you know?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitler wasn't a religious nut, nor was Stalin, nor Mao?  I know we 
<br>
caught an alleged religious nut this morning.  I know that a few years ago a 
<br>
racist nut went through my neighborhood shooting people but those were pikers 
<br>
compared to Hitler, Stalin or Mao as well as some others we know.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also read that article and yes I noticed the kid made a passing 
<br>
reference to God but I don't know upon what level of intensity to read that.  Is 
<br>
he extremely religious or has he picked up an expression without thinking what 
<br>
it even means?  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I noticed that everyone has walked right by the reporters hand 
<br>
wringing over this kid allegedly being so bright.  Do you and the others, by your 
<br>
silence, agree that there is something deeply wrong with having an IQ that 
<br>
high?  If so you might excuse him on that basis.  If you think a boy that 
<br>
intelligent can and is perfectly healthy then you might also excuse his belief in 
<br>
God on that basis.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case given that the universe is somewhere 10 and 20 billion 
<br>
years old (I have seen no agreement on the age); that we can't even agree whether 
<br>
or not this universe is the only one nor even how big it might be -- after 
<br>
all when we look closely at the stars that are the furthest removed of any we 
<br>
know then beyond them we see more stars.  Under all those circumstances isn't it 
<br>
a little dogmatic to make vast sweeping statements about God.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion we have to all be somewhat agnostic whether we mainly 
<br>
believe in God or believe there is no God.  We have to reserve a possibility 
<br>
that we are mistaken.
<br>
