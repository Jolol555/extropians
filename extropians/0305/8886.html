<p>What would you suggest instead of democracy?
<br>
<p>I ask this as someone who sort of agrees with you but has not figured
<br>
out what sort of system I would support.
<br>
<p>Obviously the best system is me and my friends in charge with
<br>
input from everybody else and delegation to experts but I don't
<br>
know that I could easily get others to buy into that system.
<br>
<p>The virtue of democracy seems to be that it is better than
<br>
civil war.  If you can convince enough people of something
<br>
you probably would also win a contest of arms.  This does
<br>
not say who is right but it tells you who is going to get their
<br>
way and avoids some bloodshed.  Democracy as currently
<br>
implemented is not really democracy and has many flaws but
<br>
it does lessen the cost of strong disagreements.
<br>
<p>One improvement I see to democracy is to make it harder to
<br>
pass laws.  If all laws were as hard as constitutional
<br>
amendments I think we would have the important laws and
<br>
get rid of a lot of red tape.  If I could convince a majority of
<br>
that it could happen.  Say 90% of congress to pass a law
<br>
and 75% to keep one going.  Of course some things require
<br>
a decision, so a 90% vote could decide to decide a given
<br>
question by majority.  But for some people the difficulty of
<br>
getting a law passed is the &quot;red tape&quot;.  Some people think
<br>
more laws and more government is the way to go.
<br>
<p>Actually, I get the impression it's already pretty hard to get 
<br>
laws passed in the US  A lots of the problems may come
<br>
from lack of representation.  People no longer group by
<br>
city or state.  We group much more by common interests
<br>
and ethics (favorite sport or TV show).  A third house
<br>
of congress based on special interests and values, and
<br>
designed for serious debate might be good.
<br>
<p>Anyway, people can always resort to force of arms to resolve
<br>
disputes it's just highly biased against in modern cultures.  Usually
<br>
someone who can win by force (these days) could more easily
<br>
have their way by other means.
<br>
<p>I am all for a society composed of well educated, reasonable
<br>
people who decide things based on high principle.  People who
<br>
learn about the issues most important to them and don't take
<br>
their own opinions to seriously when they are ignorant on a
<br>
subject.  In such a society democracy or a republic could work
<br>
wonderfully.  We are nowhere near that now but it's probably
<br>
easier to manipulate the political system in one's favor than to
<br>
have a civil war or create an aristocracy of our friends.
<br>
<p>Lee, I think you are saying that principles or results are more
<br>
important than the system.  But how do people decide which
<br>
principles and what results.  Logic is a good answer but how
<br>
does one decide whose logic is correct.  I'm only right 70%
<br>
of the time on controversial issues.  If you are sure enough
<br>
and an issue is important enough you fight.  But for lesser
<br>
issues some means of compromise seems wise.  
<br>
<p>There are a few of my ideas.  I suppose many of us have ideas
<br>
about how to improve government and what results we want.
<br>
Few of us are willing to do the work to change other people's
<br>
minds though.  It's hard enough to convince a majority of people
<br>
on this list of something.  Anyway, I'm busy studying nutrition
<br>
and such but I do want to make a hobby of politics.
