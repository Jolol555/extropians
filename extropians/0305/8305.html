<p><em>&gt; So what category is *your* post (i.e., *this* thread) in?
</em><br>
<p>I assume pan-critical rationalism requires you to start criticizing 
<br>
immediately as you read a message, however, much writing effort could be 
<br>
saved by reading the entire post prior to responding (or at least the 
<br>
5th paragraph).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sorry ;-) but I'm already criticizing your idea. But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely believe that nothing should be above criticism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (as a loyal adherent of PCR) firmly contend that criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the life blood of progress.
</em><br>
<p>Well, whatever. To me it's all design. And when I design, first I build 
<br>
up, then I take away. I design a bit beyond the requirements, so I can 
<br>
see where I can add value within the budget. I keep awareness of 
<br>
constraints, but experience teaches what issues can be bypassed in this 
<br>
phase.
<br>
<p>Then I begin to trim away redundancies, and extraneous material. When 
<br>
there is nothing else to take away, then I'm done. But the idea must be 
<br>
allowed time and space to grow. If I begin to take away too early, then 
<br>
I limit my possibilities. I trust my background thinking, and unless 
<br>
it's some sort of dire emergency, avoid designing and implementing on 
<br>
the same day. I 'sleep on it', and before I sleep, try to think how it 
<br>
could be different or if I've failed to see some error. Sometimes just 
<br>
the build-up can take weeks.
<br>
<p>How do you develop your own ideas? Do you alternate mental sentences of 
<br>
creativity with criticism? Do you find yourself constantly shooting down 
<br>
your own thoughts, before they're allowed to take flight? If not, why do 
<br>
you have the need to do so to others?
<br>
<p>Take a another look at your post. Is there any constructive criticism? 
<br>
Do you suggest any improvements or alternates? Or do you immediately and 
<br>
simply reject the notion we can become more productive if we structure 
<br>
our discourse a bit. Does your post do anything to extend the 
<br>
conversation, or does it just attempt to end it?
<br>
<p>My post had been up there for a good day. No one had responded. The 
<br>
topic was dead as far as I was concerned. Your post had no value 
<br>
whatsoever, except to demonstrate to yourself your alleged 'PCR' skills 
<br>
and stroke your own ego.
