Storms were not always identified, in part because even though they reached 
<br>
the ground, they didn't hit areas that were populated. Now that Americans 
<br>
live in a more densely populated nation, and the suburbs and exurbs have been 
<br>
extended; more areas have been subject to damage. Hence the swirled debri is 
<br>
exhibited. Secondly, advanced doppler has allowed tornado identification, 
<br>
much more readilly, whereas, before doppler tornado existance is now 
<br>
verified. The info is still skewed and the left is thrawting metorology and 
<br>
climatology for its own ends. The Right can do this also, its our job to 
<br>
declaim this also. 
<br>
<p>Harvey Storm Newstrom asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Are you aware that tornados are defined as funnel clouds that actually 
<br>
reach
<br>
the ground?  Doppler Radar helps us detect cloud rotation for advance
<br>
warning, but they do not help us determine whether a touchdown has actually
<br>
occurred.  This is done by a site visit to ascertain the damage on the
<br>
ground.  (Don't you watch the Weather Channel?)
<br>
So, no, it is not explainable by Doppler radar.  If it were, I would expect
<br>
the graph to be relatively flat with steps at the point that radar and later
<br>
Doppler radar were deployed.  This is not reflected in the historical data,
<br>
which instead shows a definite incline before and after Doppler radar.--
