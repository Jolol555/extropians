<p>U.S. House approves $2.4 billion for nanotech research. The U.S. House of
<br>
Representatives gave a big boost to a tiny technology on Wednesday, voting
<br>
to increase research funding that could lead to molecule-sized computers and
<br>
medical robots that travel the human bloodstream. By a vote of 405-19, the
<br>
House earmarked $2.36 billion over three years to fund research in
<br>
nanotechnology, the science of manipulating individual atoms to create new
<br>
materials. (Yahoo 5/8/03)

<p>Brave new world or miniature menace? Why Charles fears grey goo nightmare.
<br>
Royal Society asked to look at risks of nanotechnology. The scenario is a
<br>
familiar one: scientists open Pandora's box, awaken Frankenstein's monster,
<br>
or maybe just play God. But this time the menace on the laboratory bench is
<br>
undetectable with any conceivable optical microscope.
<br>
It offers a nightmare vision straight out of science fiction - the
<br>
destruction of the environment, perhaps even of the world, by robots smaller
<br>
than viruses, able to share intelligence, replicate themselves and take
<br>
command of the planet. That is the catch with nanotechnology: you cannot see
<br>
it, so you cannot know how afraid you should be. But if Prince Charles is
<br>
any guide, environmentalists should be very afraid indeed. (Guardian

<p>How to Grab an Atom. Like a diner spearing a morsel of food with the tine of
<br>
a fork, researchers have used the tip of a microscopic needle to lift a
<br>
single atom from a surface and then replace it. The experiment, reported in
<br>
the 2 May PRL, marks the first time single atoms have been manipulated using
<br>
a purely mechanical technique, rather than one involving electric current.
<br>
The new method could allow researchers to maneuver single atoms of
<br>
nonconductive as well as conductive materials, perhaps for nanoscale
<br>
circuits of the future. (Physical Review Focus 5/3/03)

<p>Mighty Mini Motor (video). Nanotechnologists try to create new materials or
<br>
incredibly tiny machines by manipulating atoms and molecules. One of
<br>
nanotechnology's biggest dreams is biomedical devices that could travel
<br>
anywhere inside your body and fix parts that need repair. Today, some
<br>
scientists have already made a start on this dream. They're making
<br>
incredibly tiny motors that could drive the world's smallest machines, and
<br>
help keep us well...At Purdue University's School of Veterinary Medicine,
<br>
molecular biologist Peixuan Guo thinks that RNA has enormous potential for
<br>
nanotechnology because it is an extremely flexible molecule. &quot;RNA is much
<br>
easier to make than protein,&quot; Guo explains, &quot;and compared to DNA, it comes
<br>
in many more sizes and shapes. With DNA, we are limited to its double helix
<br>
structure.&quot; Guo and his research team have discovered that RNA binds
<br>
adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the chemical fuel that proteins use in the
<br>
body to allow muscles to move and nerves to function. &quot;ATP works the way
<br>
gasoline does in a car,&quot; says Guo. &quot;You could not walk or talk or think
<br>
without the chemical fuel of ATP.&quot; (ScienCenteral News 5/1/03)

<p>Proteins produce nano-magnetic computer memory. Computer hard drive capacity
<br>
could be increased a hundredfold by using a common protein to fabricate
<br>
nano-scale magnetic particles, claims UK company Nanomagnetics. It uses the
<br>
protein apoferritin, the main molecule in which iron is stored in the body,
<br>
to create a material consisting of magnetic particles each just a few
<br>
nanometres in diameter. Each particle can store a bit of information and
<br>
together they can be packed onto a disk drive at much greater density than
<br>
is possible using existing hard disk manufacturing methods. (New Scientist

<p>Playing God. Through genetic engineering, you could give birth to an
<br>
Olympian, a musical prodigy or a genius -- but should you? Bill McKibben is
<br>
a man on the edge. He lives on the edge of the Adirondack wilderness in New
<br>
York, where he writes books about the limits of technology. Fifteen years
<br>
ago, he wrote &quot;The End of Nature,&quot; in which he argued, with cogency and
<br>
foresight, that human dependence on fossil fuels was endangering our
<br>
relationship to the Earth itself. In his new book, &quot;Enough,&quot; McKibben
<br>
describes a new edge. We've come to a threshold with the emerging
<br>
technologies of genetic engineering, robotics and nanotechnology, McKibben
<br>
believes. One more step and we will &quot;call into question our understanding of
<br>
what it means to be a human being.&quot; (San Francisco Chronicle 4.27.03)

<br>
he writes, &quot;alter our relationship not with the rest of nature but with

ourselves.&quot; McKibben argues that this debate is too important to be left to
<br>
scientists. &quot;Must we forever grow in reach and power?&quot; he asks. &quot;Or can we,

should we, ever say, 'Enough'?&quot;

millions in research funds. Portland State University professor Jun Jiao
<br>
addressed the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
<br>
Transportation last Thursday regarding the 21st Century Nanotechnology
<br>
Research and Development Act. Nanotechnology is an emerging field in which
<br>
matter is manipulated at the atomic level in order to build materials,
<br>
machines, and devices. Advances in the fields of nanoscience and
<br>
nanotechnology could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as materials and

<p>Nanoscale Networks: Superlong nanotubes can form a grid. For a decade,
<br>
materials scientists have dreamed of using cylinders of carbon with walls
<br>
just one atom thick as the building blocks for a new generation of sensors,
<br>
transistors, and other tiny devices. Before that happens, however,
<br>
researchers must find better ways to grow and align these carbon nanotubes.
<br>
Jie Liu and his colleagues at Duke University in Durham, N.C., now report
<br>
growing the longest individual carbon nanotubes ever and aligning them in a
<br>
two-dimensional grid. (Sciencenews 5/3/03)

<p>Nanoprobe To Be Developed For A 'Fantastic Voyage' In The Human Body,
<br>
Finding And Treating Deadly Tumors. A UC Irvine research team has received a
<br>
five-year, $1.4 million National Institutes of Health grant to develop a
<br>
microscopic probe for detecting and treating pre-cancerous and malignant
<br>
tumors in humans. Similar to the miniaturized vessel that explores a human
<br>
body in the science fiction movie &quot;Fantastic Voyage,&quot; this nano-sized probe
<br>
would be inserted into a patient and then guided through the esophagus,
<br>
stomach and colon to determine if tumors are growing on the wall of the
<br>
intestine. The probe would be remotely controlled by a surgeon operating a
<br>
device called an endoscope. (ScienceDaily 5/9/03)

<p>On the tube. A new type of computer memory uses carbon, rather than
<br>
silicon...Carbon comes in many forms. Diamonds and graphite are two of the
<br>
most familiar ones. A less familiar variety is the nanotube, also known as a
<br>
&quot;buckytube&quot; after Richard Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes have a
<br>
framework similar to the arrangement of the atoms in a nanotube. Nanotubes
<br>
consist of a cylindrical array of carbon atoms whose diameter is only about
<br>
1 nanometre (a billionth of a metre). If Nantero, a firm based in Woburn,
<br>
Massachusetts, proves correct, such tubes will soon be an integral part of
<br>
computer memories. (The Economist 5/8/03)

others insist on going it alone. But when prodded with laser light,

inherently gregarious atoms known as bosons can act like loner atoms known

The faux-loner atoms can even form tenuous pairs, much like the electrons in

a superconductor, so that they resemble a long-sought new state of matter.

<p>Nano and the Professor. In 1959, physicist Dr. Richard Feynman gave birth to
<br>
the concept of nanotechnology. Feynman described the theoretical approaches
<br>
to &quot;manipulating and controlling things on a very small scale.&quot; For
<br>
instance, he recognized that computers, then the size of buildings, would
<br>
need to get continually smaller to become important to our lives. He also
<br>
predicted advances in medicine and learning. Feynman's only real misjudgment
<br>
was that he overestimated our ability to figure any of this out. &quot;In the
<br>
year 2000, when they look back at this age, they will wonder why it was not
<br>
until the year 1960 that anybody began seriously to move in this direction.&quot;

<p>Researchers see the light as they peel away space mystery. Tiny multilayered
<br>
balls called &quot;carbon onions,&quot; produced in laboratory studies, appear to have

the same light-absorption characteristics as dust particles in the regions

between the stars. &quot;It's the strongest evidence yet that cosmic dust has a
<br>
multilayered onionlike carbon structure,&quot; said Manish Chhowalla, assistant
<br>
professor of ceramic and materials engineering at Rutgers, The State
<br>
University of New Jersey. Chhowalla used transmission electron microscopes
<br>
to study radiation absorption of the laboratory-produced onions and found
<br>
characteristics virtually identical to those reported by astrophysicists
<br>
studying dust in deep space. A carbon onion is a miniscule but intricate

component of nanotechnology-the study of structures and devices on a scale
<br>
that can approach one-millionth the width of a human hair. (ISA 4/30/03)

the many take-home lessons for the United States and its allies after the

ailments they believed resulted from exposure to the Iraqi regime's arsenal.

More than a decade later, several companies are turning to nanotechnology to
<br>
counter the threats of biological and chemical warfare. Their efforts range
<br>
from gloves and gear that block out toxic chemicals and germs to fabrics and
