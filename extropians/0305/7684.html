I  went and re-read some of the old articles about Ted Turner's gift of
<br>
$1 billion over ten years to the UN. I think Turner is in the running
<br>
for 'Dunce of the Decade'. I respect his business acumen, but talk about
<br>
just pissing money away for no good reason. It seemed like such a bad
<br>
idea even then, in 1997 when he announced it. He wanted to take the
<br>
money out of the US economy where it was doing some good and hand it off
<br>
to the UN where now, it seems, they will use it to purchase new
<br>
silverware. Turner might have invested it in a poor country, or several,
<br>
and he would have been a real hero. But now, the UN is clinically
<br>
impotent, and has lost whatever teeth the US was providing. Turner is no
<br>
doubt spitting mad. I'd love for him to go public with some of his
<br>
thoughts on Bush.

<p><p>Interesting to note that Aramark tends to low-ball businesses and
<br>
institutions for such contracts, and then provide a lower service level
<br>
agreement. Money is the mantra and that is what most care about,until
<br>
it hits the fan. Combine this with a org (UN) that pimps for dictators,
<br>
because allah or marx so command it, and you have the UN. I would vote
<br>
for a more pleasing international institution, that suit US interests.
<br>
Something that by-passes the UN, the EU, the Hague etc. 
<br>
<p>Aramark and the UN: Two bad organizations that need to be boycotted.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Come Monday, the workers should be back at their stations. The dispute
<br>
has been temporarily resolved with the Union agreeing that the vacation
<br>
pay remains RA's responsibility. The Union also wasn't willing to risk
<br>
Aramark's only option of replacing all the workers. 
<br>
<p>Terry Colvin quoted an article:
<br>
&lt;&lt;The decision to make the cafeterias into &quot;no pay zones&quot; spread through
<br>
the 40-acre complex like wildfire. Soon, the hungry patrons came
<br>
running. &quot;It was chaos, wild, something out of a war scene,&quot; said one
<br>
Aramark executive who was present. &quot;They took everything, even the
<br>
silverware,&quot; she said. Another witness from U.N. security said the
<br>
cafeteria was &quot;stripped bare.&quot; And another told TIME that the cafeteria
<br>
raid was &quot;unbelievable, crowds of people just  taking everything
<br>
in sight; they stripped the place bare.&quot; And yet another astonished
<br>
witness said that &quot;chickens, turkeys, souffles, casseroles all went out
<br>
the door (unpaid).&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br>
&lt;&lt;&quot;I hope we have large crowds rushing to come to lunch on Monday,&quot; an
<br>
Aramark executive said. &quot;But this time we expect them to pay for what
<br>
they take.&quot;&gt;&gt;
