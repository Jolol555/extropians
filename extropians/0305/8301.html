<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think that the majority of Americans...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are consistently tricked, duped, programmed - by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a language that denies or regretfully forgets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the major discoveries made by physicists in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1920's and anthropologists ever since.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But that was prior to 1933 when we all got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; straightened out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, what a man he was (sarcasm). The first mad visionary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring human eugenics to such a massive and structured level.
</em><br>
<p>No, no, no!  Not *that* visionary.  I am speaking of---of
<br>
course---the great Count Alfred.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Curious how until 1933 humanity had not been yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; favored by evolution to adopt appropriate and sane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; speech patterns.  One might have thought that given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; several hundred thousand years, nineteen civilizations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innumerable tribes and nations and societies competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with each other, better techniques of thinking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasoning were not stumbled upon.  So the burden of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explanation must now lie with those who claim that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the ways humans think now and have been thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; since 1610 are unfit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sarcasm again? I'm not sure.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  You'd have got the first irony if you'd known
<br>
about Null-A and Korzybski.  The above paragraph is
<br>
entirely serious!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just in case, to clarify, [thanks!] i don't think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity has not developed &quot;appropriately.&quot;  Rather i
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that in the case of relativity and the Copenhagen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interpretation as with much of  scientific history it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes a while for new discoveries to reach popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, like Darwin, for the most egregious example!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More, i will enjoy the emergence of the type of thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i think will come about from the integration of quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking. (This seems inevitable and is already happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to the proliferation of quantum technology such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers).
</em><br>
<p>I'm quite skeptical that QM has any great implications for
<br>
thinking any more than Relativity did.  Sure, they loosen
<br>
up one's preconceptions, and get us more accustomed to the
<br>
idea that not everything in the universe that is true must
<br>
seem natural to savannah-evolved brains.  Why does QM, and
<br>
in particular the dreaded Copenhagen Interpretation, assist
<br>
in anything?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Language being what it is, and shaping the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people and cultures think, in the way s that it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leads me to be hopefully curious as to how the addition of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum language or even more simply language patterns 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like e-prime will affect  human behavior.  E-prime has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already been hailed by many a semanticist as a useful tool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in getting out of the bias of Aristotelian &quot;IS&quot; logic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and making accessible the experience and understanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of neurological relativity.
</em><br>
<p>I still have a hunch that even an entire nation wholeheartedly
<br>
endorsing e-prime would still be driven by the usual ways
<br>
our brain chemistry works.  And those ways are *not* very 
<br>
faulty.  The faults, so far as I can see, don't like with
<br>
people's thinking in general, but with characteristic lacks
<br>
afflicting people individually.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, i personally am not going to try and prove that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the ways humans think now and have been thinking since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1610 are unfit.&quot; If you want the references to the research on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how language affects culture and behavior let me know and i'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get it to you when i return from vacation - next tuesday.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'd love to have a nice argument, err, discussion about
<br>
Sapir-Whorf and all.  There is no doubt that language *does*
<br>
affect thought and culture, not to mention behavior---but for
<br>
most of the 20th century, that effect was overestimated IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe general semantics [!] and a course of logic should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; be included in journalism schools.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, it is indeed sad to see even young reporters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lapse immediately upon graduation to the two-valued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prevalent Aristotelian orientations, adopt bad s.r,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fail to adopt *structural* and multi-ordinal semantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relations, employ elementalistic terminology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intensional definitions, undue generalization,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unanalyzed linguistic habits., to such a degree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's probably too late to re-educate the younger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generation with null-A non-habitual s.r, remove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; semantic blockages,.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is s.r?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also, what is null-A- habitual s.r.?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, just as I suspected, when &quot;1933&quot; didn't ring a bell.
<br>
You have not read &quot;Science and Sanity&quot; (not that I am
<br>
especially recommending it).  But surely you know something
<br>
of Korzybski and General Semantics, or you wouldn't have
<br>
used the term.  Null-A, s.r, and all the rest of it (I
<br>
could write &quot;Null-A, s.r,.&quot; instead), it's all explained
<br>
in Science and Sanity.
