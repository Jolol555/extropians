<br>
<p>Anders,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sure are on a painful subject.  In the winter 1979-80 I was 
<br>
wondering what our immediate interstellar neighborhood looked like.  It eventually 
<br>
occured to me that the SF stories often depicted spaceships as having not 
<br>
windows but viewscreens -- oh, that is a computer monitor.  Then I decided an 
<br>
asterisk would make a perfectly good star.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My local library supplied the bearings and distance to what the book 
<br>
said was the nearest 25 stars.  One xerox copy of a page later I was in 
<br>
business.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a model of our star neighborhood that could be rotated and also 
<br>
that I could &quot;drive&quot; through.  I took my memories of walking railroad tracks 
<br>
as a boy and designed in 4' per half mile as my paralax correction -- that is 
<br>
probably wrong but it was a start.  I worked all day and into the evening on an 
<br>
old Trash 80 packing, I believe, 8 k in core and using a cassette tape 
<br>
recorder for memory storage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guys I had a simulated space ship that could be drove through our 
<br>
neighborhood but I needed to displace myself off that center line through the sun. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a problem for another day so I decided to save and shut down 
<br>
for the evening.  I punched the wrong button while saving and lost the entire 
<br>
program.  To this day, 23 years later, I have never had the heart to redo that 
<br>
job.  That is why this is a painful subject. &lt;G&gt; Thanks, Anders.
<br>
Ron h.
