<p>I bought his book two months ago and find it quite plausible. Also, I 
<br>
purchased John Barrow's latest, last month and am still reading through it. I 
<br>
feel that now that Inflation has been generally accepted and that evidence 
<br>
that an accelerated inflation is conceivable, (wmap etc) then varying light 
<br>
speed is likely. Incidentially, I once coresponded with GFR Ellis and he was 
<br>
quite energetic, as I recall in his anti-Tipler comments. I remember he 
<br>
seemed somewhat short on specifics on why he was opposed, but thats what 
<br>
makes ballgames, and cosmology I suppose. I thought of him as the 
<br>
&quot;anti-Tipler&quot; sig transit gloria cosma :-)  If entropy is tunable by some 
<br>
process, then how the universe behaves, becomes tantalizingly important, if 
<br>
not to our species, then whomever emerges from us.
