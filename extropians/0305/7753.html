</em><br>
<p>True. And it would seem with some urgency. I have/had found
<br>
time to read only part of what Leon Kass has to say in the article
<br>
you cited and in his role as Chair of the Presidents Council
<br>
on Bioethics in the paper relating to stem cells.
<br>
<p>I think it would be a dangerous mistake to regard the likes of 
<br>
Kass as a lightweight. There are apparently some pretty serious
<br>
careers to be made by &quot;bioethicists&quot; like Kass (and writers like 
<br>
Crichton) collecting dollars and kudos by playing on prejudices
<br>
and fears. 
<br>
<p>It is not like one can take on someone like Kass intellectually
<br>
and politically and expect a level playing field. To persuade
<br>
politically two things need to be achieved. First you need to
<br>
hold the attention of the audience (the listeners, the voters, 
<br>
the policy setters) long enough for them to consider what your
<br>
saying and *then* you have to persuade them. It does no
<br>
good to just intellectually outscore Kass on debating points
<br>
only to find that no-one is listening anymore anyway. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately until the ordinary man and woman in the street
<br>
starts to sense that the issues (stem cells, gene therapy, cryonics,
<br>
whatever) are not *just* esoterics but that they will in fact have 
<br>
some personal effect on them and in a timeframe soon enough for
<br>
them to care about, the problem is not just in winning the debate
<br>
intellectually (though that still has to happen), the real problem is
<br>
in holding the attention of the audience whose votes will set the 
<br>
policy in the first place. On a superficial hearing a guy like Kass
<br>
can sound stoic and noble. Historically dying with grace and 
<br>
dignity (because you were going to anyway) was often seen as
<br>
the better alternative than dying without it. Unfortunately its often
<br>
the superficial level that folks vote on.
