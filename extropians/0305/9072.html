<em>&gt; &gt; Matt Ridley author of the Red Queen has written a book Nature

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;teaser&quot; article. The science may be light but I liked it.

<em>&gt; &gt;

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Only now is it dawning on scientists .... that learning itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consists of nothing more than switching genes on and off &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ......
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meaning what? 
</em><br>
<p>That's what I wondered. The article is a teaser for a pop sci
<br>
book out next month. The above statement got my non-expert
<br>
attention and drew me in. I liked the article because appearing 
<br>
in Time it seemed to be firing a timely suggestion at a non-scientific
<br>
readership that they are more than their genes, that genetics and 
<br>
the environment interact in (to what to most folks) will still be 
<br>
surprisingly ways. ie. We're more than our genes *and* we're
<br>
more than our environment.  Its not nature vs nurture. Its nature
<br>
*and* nurture. Not thesis vs antithesis. Each of us is a new 
<br>
synthesis dependent on both. Yet increasingly we are coming to
<br>
understand *how* the interrelationships between our genes and 
<br>
our environments work.  Good stuff in my view for diffusing 
<br>
irrational fears re cloning and sneaking some science past the
<br>
guard of a wider public than might otherwise listen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That we can change our DNA by mental concentration?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That our  DNA changes throughout life as we learn?  That 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned data are encoded in  DNA and passed along to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children as some racial memory?
</em><br>
<p>(Aside: It seems to me that the popular fixation on DNA seems
<br>
to be wrong to me. Its DNA *interacting* with proteins which 
<br>
do almost everything that matters in biology. DNA of itself is
<br>
almost completely uninteresting. The same DNA is in every cell
<br>
type. Yet what makes different cell types and this applies all the
<br>
way back to the fertilized egg which contains a cocktail of proteins
<br>
is the way the proteins interact with the DNA and selectively turn
<br>
certain genes off and on in turn creating other proteins in the mix
<br>
both in type and in number. If we knew all the proteins in the 
<br>
maternal oocyte, both number and type, that would be powerful 
<br>
knowledge indeed, because these early proteins are crucial to
<br>
early development and they do not come from the DNA of the
<br>
fertilized egg or new individual but from the mother. At this point
<br>
we don't know what these are). 
<br>
<p>The bit (above) on learning as switching genes on and off I found
<br>
intriguing but I don't have the quite enough science to square it
<br>
away easily. I'd be interested in Anders or someone elses take on
<br>
whether the following is oversimplified.
<br>
<p>Article states &quot;we know how the brain changes; by the real-time
<br>
expression of 17 genes, known as the CREB genes. They must
<br>
be switched on and off to alter connections among nerve cells in
<br>
the brain and thus lay down a new long-term memory. Memory
<br>
is in the genes in the sense that it uses genes, not in the sense that
<br>
you inherit memories.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; To say this is &quot;light&quot; on science is an understatement!  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece seems to simply restate the old nature-vs-nurture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate, misunderstanding half of  it, and presenting it as if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it were some strange, new discovery.  I don't  see any new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  biological information in this piece.  This seems to be basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetics and environment.  However, some of the statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and conclusions seem off-the wall.
</em><br>
<p>The article does do some restating of the old nature-vs-nurture
<br>
but I thought it did it as background context not as reaffirmation.
<br>
<p>There probably isn't going to be much that is genuinely new
<br>
biological information in a piece like this (at least to those who
<br>
are getting their info from science journals or are pretty well read
<br>
and informed already, but even on a list such as this we vary in
<br>
the depths to which we understand certain subjects). 
<br>
<p>Where did you think the science got too light (perhaps to the 
<br>
point of being dangerously misleading in some places) given
<br>
the target audience? 
<br>
<p>Which statements struck you as particularly off the wall?
