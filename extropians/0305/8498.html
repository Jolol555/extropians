<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;[In the non-iterated Prisoners' Dilemma] *OBVIOUSLY* Doug 2003 should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Defect, since he knows that the 1983 version is going to cooperate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Not if Doug-2003 is also an altruist.  There's more than one possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;reason to cooperate, after all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well hell's bells.  If that's the case, then why ever Defect?
</em><br>
<p>As far as I can tell, from an altruist's perspective, the only good reason 
<br>
for defecting in a Prisoner's Dilemna is that you were just defected 
<br>
against, and you think that by defecting in retaliation you can discourage 
<br>
future negative-sum behavior by the other player, thus maximizing the size 
<br>
of the global pie.
<br>
<p>Defection, for altruists, is just as counterintuitive as cooperation for 
<br>
the selfish, with the same aha! notion - Tit for Tat - being crucial in 
<br>
both cases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Listen, the whole idea behind the *entries* in the table is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are the payoffs of the players.  That's what the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *mean*, the utilities of the players.
</em><br>
<p>What the experiments *measure* is monetary amounts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, although I say that it means you should definitely defect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in almost all cases, I am not the kind of extremist that Smullyan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, who claimed that he would defect even against his mirror image.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Was he just trying to be provocative, or did he slip a bearing?)
</em><br>
<p>He was feeding you lies, to minimize the amount of competition you 
<br>
presented.  Never trust a D player.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I say that you should Defect (and that is what the entries in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; table say too) whenever you know what your opponent is going to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you know he is going to Defect, then you Defect.  If you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he is going to Cooperate, then you Defect.  It's right there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the table.
</em><br>
<p>Not if your opponent determined his behavior by running an accurate 
<br>
simulation of what you would do if you knew definitely what your opponent 
<br>
would do.  Think timeless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The highly interesting case is if you don't know what he's going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do AND his behavior is probably correlated with yours.  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would be afraid to Defect against a physical duplicate if he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a close (or near) duplicate.  After all, whatever thoughts I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are likely to course through his head as well.  But if it any entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever, including 1983 versions of myself, then the table says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Defect&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>And knowing this, your past self will defect against you, since he knows 
<br>
you know what his behavior will be.
<br>
<p>By your logic, in fact, you and your past self should play this way even 
<br>
on the *iterated* Prisoner's Dilemna.  After all, you know what his 
<br>
decision will be on every round.  Oddly enough, though, the past you 
<br>
remember is a string of defections.  How sad.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, the two cooperating Eliezers walk away, grinning, pockets 
<br>
loaded with utility tokens.  So who's the rationalist now, wise guy?
<br>
<p>(This is not intended as an insult; it is the standard formal rejoinder 
<br>
that should be delivered to anyone claiming that a behavior which delivers 
<br>
noticeably poorer results is &quot;rational&quot;.  It can be very hard to show that 
<br>
the best solution is a special case of Bayesian reasoning, but it always is.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Mixing time travel and the Prisoner's Dilemma sure does make for some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;interesting situations.  It can be resolved to mutual cooperation using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the Golden Law, but only if Doug-1983 can accurately simulate a future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;self who knows his past self's decision.  The time-travel oneshot PD can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;also be resolved much more straightforwardly by making a binding promise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to yourself, using self-modification or a pre-existing emotion of honor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, there are all sorts of interesting ways to change the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the boxes as written.
</em><br>
<p>All three of the scenarios above work for pure utility boxes, with the 
<br>
standard numbers.
