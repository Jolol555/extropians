<p>The glass is half full in this case. Before agriculture social
<br>
organisation did not have any class structure, and was usually
<br>
based on small bands of 2-4 families foraging together. Such
<br>
groups usually do not have much economic or power distinction
<br>
between members. They are simply too small and closely knit. But
<br>
once you get larger groups - villages, tribes, you get &quot;big
<br>
men&quot;.  Still, even here the power distances are very small. It
<br>
is when you move to larger organisations when the power
<br>
distances really start to grow. 
<br>
<p>One can make an information theoretic explanation for this: the
<br>
number of interactions needed to coordinate N people if
<br>
everybody needs to speak to everyone scales as N^2, and beyond a
<br>
certain point far too much time and energy is taken up by
<br>
discussing and seeking consensus. By putting this power in the
<br>
hand of a central coordinator the effort becomes linear. But
<br>
that becomes too cumbersome after a certain size; then it makes
<br>
sense to have a over-coordinator talking to a number of
<br>
sub-coordinators speaking with the rest. So we end up with a
<br>
pyramid of power with log(N) levels.
<br>
<p>What is happening right now is that we - thanks to affluence and
<br>
technology - are finding ways of organising without coercion and
<br>
with less need for power distances. We can afford mistakes and
<br>
inefficiencies since the benefits of freedom are even larger; in
<br>
the farming village the opposite is true. 
<br>
<p><p>(The misspelling 'agrivulture' popped up; maybe this is a good term for gts' 
<br>
position on it? :-)
