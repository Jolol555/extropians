<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Stanford professor states the obvious: some electronic voting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines are not auditable and easily hacked.
</em><br>
<p>This is well known and has been widely discussed in the security industry.
<br>
Standard security requirements for double-checks, auditing, logging,
<br>
testing, external verification, etc., have been excluded by these machines
<br>
and the companies that produce them.  They cannot be evaluated as secure
<br>
using standard techniques the way they are implemented.  Many security
<br>
organizations have discussed publishing official statements against these
<br>
machines.  There also have been some discussions that security professionals
<br>
cannot ethically be involved in supporting these elections as accurate given
<br>
the current situation with these machines.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, is there an attack here I don't see? If so, can you plug the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole, or come up with a system with the same safeguards?
</em><br>
<p>The problem is more political than technological.  I see no problems with
<br>
your solution, but I don't think it addresses the root problems that are
<br>
preventing these machines from being auditable.  If the state legislatures
<br>
would allow security to be part of the voting process, we already have
<br>
proven methods for this.
<br>
<p>The problem is that these machines are proprietary and the manufacturer's
<br>
contracts forbid third-party audits of the machines.  They also don't want
<br>
anybody looking at their software code, so it can't be verified.  There also
<br>
is political resistance to having any kind of audit trail, even like the one
<br>
you suggest.  The idea is to avoid recount fiascos by eliminating the
<br>
possibility of a recount.  This is quite a hot topic here in Florida, where
<br>
Jeb Bush and the republicans in the state legislature want to destroy all
<br>
the ballots from the 2000 presidential election to avoid any possibility of
<br>
future counts.  They also would like to pre-emptively do this for all future
<br>
elections.  By eliminating all audit trails, there is no way someone can
<br>
demand a recount.
<br>
<p>Also, be aware that the system is much larger than the piece you are
<br>
addressing.  Your system proves is that the newspaper correctly reported
<br>
back an encrypted version of each person's vote.  How do we know this list
<br>
matches what was counted?  How do we know the counts add up to what totals
<br>
were reported?  How do we know a bunch of extra votes weren't added?  How do
<br>
we know if all the voters were eligible to vote?  How do we know that each
<br>
person only voted once?  There are a lot of audit areas beyond the single
<br>
one you excellently solved.  But the political problems are bigger than the
<br>
technological ones.
