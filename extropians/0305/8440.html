</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If people here took that position then they were wrong.  There is absolutely
<br>
no reason any news network should be obligated to post every single
<br>
televised word on its website. 
<br>
<p>News networks did not even have websites until a few years ago. Are you
<br>
suggesting that no argument about what transpired in the media could be
<br>
resolved until the advent of the internet? 
<br>
<p>I see from another message that you were able to find the transcript that
<br>
you were looking for, so your accusation of &quot;rewriting history&quot; is not valid
<br>
anyway. 
<br>
<p>Probably the law requires that all television networks keep an unpublished
<br>
archive of video tapes and/or transcripts of all broadcasts for X number of
<br>
months, in case there should ever be any need for them in any legal
<br>
investigation. That is all that should be required of them. Websites are
<br>
separate publications.
<br>
<p>As for the charge of fraud, it looks like the CNN reporter was saying one
<br>
thing about the physical effects of assault weapons while LaPierre of the
<br>
NRA was saying another. Speaking as one who has never examined closely the
<br>
effects of assault weapons on bullet-proof vests or other materials, I can't
<br>
say who is right. I would not charge &quot;fraud&quot; without better evidence than
<br>
the opinion of someone like LaPierre of the NRA who obviously has a
<br>
political motive, nor would I dismiss the charge based only on the opinion
<br>
of the CNN reporter who seems also to have had a political motive. 
<br>
<p>In other words, while I don't doubt that CNN presented a biased view of
<br>
assault weapons, I think your charges of &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;rewriting history&quot; are
<br>
both a bit over the top.
